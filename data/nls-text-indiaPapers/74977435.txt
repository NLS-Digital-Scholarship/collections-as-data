ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRESS REPORTS OF THE INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY, For the year 1871-72. BOMBAY: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT CENTRAL PRESS 1873.
No. 2775 OF 1872. FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay, 14th August 1872. SIR, With reference to Government Resolution No. 1738, dated 23rd April last, and anterior and subsequent corre- spondence, I have the honour to submit the accompanying Annual Administration Report of the Medical Department for 1871-72, with Appendices, being figured Statements showing the extent of the work of the Department during the year. I also forward the original reports of each Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, as well as the Re- port on the Vaccination Department, submitted by the Superintendent General of Vaccination. 2. I shall feel obliged by the return of all the Reports when no longer required, as time, and the limited number of the Office Establishment, did not permit of copies of them being retained for office record. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. WRIGHT, Inspector General, Indian Medical Department.
ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRESS REPORT OF THE INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, BOBMAY, FOR THE YEAR 1871-72. PREFATORY. 1. The proceedings of Government in the General Department, No. 2441, of 2nd September 1871, brought to notice certain defects in the preparation of the Administration Reports of the various departments. 2. It was anticipated that, as it is obviously of importance that statistical tables should be uniform, and uniformly adopted, the Government would, perhaps, supply tables suitable for all depart- ments, to be prescribed by the Statistical Committee referred to in the proceedings above quoted. 3. No tables have been received, and it has been my effort, in adopting tables, to make them represent the amount and kind of information that seemed of importance, but which may not be so considered by the Statistical Committee. 4. Being thus without any guide as to what information might be most desired, I have endeavoured to bring out the civil work of the department during the year with some detail, having already submitted the medical history of the Native Army. 5. I propose describingLUNATIC ASYLUMS. Colaba Lunatic Asylum. Europeans as well as natives are accommodated in this asylum, the average daily number of the former during the year being 10 and of the latter 208. Europeans.4 158 cases were treated for bodily disease, the principal affections being febricula, bronchitis, disease of the stomach and digestive organs, and debility. Causes of Insanity .5 difficult to govern. It is only by the most watchful and careful supervision that they are prevented from injuring each other. Vari- ous expedients have been adopted, and with gratifying results, to counterbalance the monotony of asylum life, to divest it of a prison character and appearance, and to restore dormant faculties, suitable occupation being the principal agent employed. During the year there has been a deficient supply of Vehar water, which suddenly ceased on the 29th of April, and the asylum was supplied, on daily requisition, by the Commissariat from that date until the 24th of June. " The supply of this water forms a considerable item in the expenses of the asylum." The Deputy Inspector General reports:6 Causes of Insanity.7 keeper's room available for the few who are employed in the service of the asylum, or who only may be awaiting the arrival of friends to leave it for good. The Acting Deputy Inspector General remarks that of all the public charities at Ahmadabad, the lunatic asylum holds the first place for completeness and efficiency. It is the only asylum within a radius of 300 miles. He can add nothing to Dr. Wyllie's report. I have tabulated the most important points of information, as to the asylum, in the appendix, so that an easy comparison may be made with other asylums of the Presidency. Sir Cowasjee Jehangeer's Lunatic Asylum, Haidarabad. The location of the asylum has been changed from Larkhana to Haidarabad during the year. The insanes left Larkhana, 31st August 18718 Lunatic Asylum, Poona. There were 76 patients under treatment during the year. 14 were discharged cured and 2 died. Of the deaths one (male) resulted from chronic diarrh9 Lunatic Asylum, Dharwar. The total number of inmates of the asylum during the year has been 24; of these, 6 were new admissions. 5 insanes have been discharged10 PRESIDENCY DIVISION AND BOMBAY MARINE. CIVIL HOSPITALS.

In diseases of the lungs the death rate is closer at the same hospitals13 (1.) The necessity, under existing arrangements, of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital supplying the Ophthalmic Hospital with diets, &c., and the reasonable complaint of the 1st Physician on this point, and the ease with which the Ophthalmic Hospi- tal can be made to supply itself with all its needs with- out reference to the J.

I beg on this point to direct attention to the remarks of the Deputy Inspector General in his Report on the hospital. (3.) The store room, the darkness in which is not to be pene- trated by an ordinary light; it requires gas. (4.) The servants' quarters, which are at present, as reported by the Deputy Inspector General, "so inferior, and in, very way so objectionable as to call for early attention." Cowasjee Jehangeer Ophthalmic Hospital. Total treated 519. No death. There were 565 operations performed. This institution maintains its position of usefulness and success. Surgeon Sylvester, who has done so much for the hospital, gave over charge of it to Assistant Surgeon Maconochie on the 20th January 1872. Lock Hospital. Closed on the 31st March 1872. Total treated 700, with 5 deaths. The working of the hospital was successful, and the class for whom it was conditionally established, seemed to appreciate the benefit of care and treatment received therein. Byculla Schools. General health of scholars good; one death from inflammation of the pharynx. There was an epidemic of measles, and many slight cases of fever. Itch.14 Tanna Civil Hospital. Total treated 154, deaths 30, or 19.4 per cent. of deaths to treated. The principal diseases were15 Carwar Civil Hospital. The hospital accommodation is very indifferent, but there is a pros- pect of improvement by the building of a new hospital. Total treated 106, died 17, or 16 per cent. Principal disease treated was malarious fever, the cases generally complicated with diseased spleen and dropsy. DISPENSARIES. Including the dispensaries attached to civil hospitals there are 34 of these institutions in this circle. No new dispensary has been opened during the year under report. Some have been sanctioned by Government, and will re- ceive notice next year. The number attending the dispensaries has been large16 JAILS. Common Jail, Bombay.

Comparatively few females were treated, owing greatly, no doubt, to the inferior accom- modation in the hospital, and the impossibility of securing any privacy for them. 4 cases of cholera were treated with 1 death. The surgical practice is important, and conducted with skill, as proved by the re- sults;19 cases of lithotomy were operated on, and all were successful.

Cholera has been absent both from the town and districts of Belgaum. Dr. Sylvester states: " An epidemic of cholera has, I believe, never been known in the town of Belgaum; but 3 talukas in the neighbour- hood are notoriously subject to it, the disease appearing in the hot months and disappearing after a few heavy falls of rain. 84 surgical cases treated, some of a serious nature.

Diarrh21 In the Poona Circle civil hospitals 3,603 persons were treated and 315 died, or 12 per cent. The death rate at each hospital was as follows:22 when brought to hospital. On the surgical practice of the hospitals the Deputy Inspector General remarks: "Few hospitals in this country can produce a greater number of interesting cases treated, or perhaps show more successful results of the more formidable operations." DISPENSARIES. There are 26 dispensaries in this Circle23 In the first year of its existence (1862), 447 patients were treated at this dispensary, whilst in the last year 3,746 persons received medical aid. " It is certain," the Deputy Inspector General reports, " that the people gladly avail themselves of the medical aid afforded to them, and are fully aware of the benefits of European medicines. I regret to say," he adds, " that vaccination does not meet with the recep- tion it deserves. The well-to-do people throughout North Kanara are positively averse to its introduction, and do all they can to thwart the Medical Officer of the dispensary in his endeavour to carry it out. This state of things is peculiarly unfortunate, as small-pox is re- ported to be endemic throughout the whole of their districts." The following summary relates to the working of 22 dispensaries, three recently established not being included in the Returns. The total number treated has been 69,914, with 172 deaths, the death rate being 2.4 per thousand. 10,154 absented, and in this number there would be many fatal cases. The number of deaths therefore can only be taken to represent the known mortality, and not the real death rate of the patients who attend the dispensary, which must necessarily be an unknown quantity. The prevalent diseases were malarious fever, affections of the stomach and bowels, thousands of them of the slightest description, and cutaneous diseases. These three classes of diseases comprise a total of 44,397, or 63 per cent. of the total sick treated. The districts have been remarkably free from epidemics during the year. Cholera was present at Pandharpur, 47 cases and 19 deaths, and at Irandol 29 cases and 10 deaths, and in addition there were two cases24 Total treated. Died. Per cent.

The daily average aggregate strength of the ten jails on this circle was 3,089. Total treated 2,836, died 43 or 1.5 per cent. of deaths to treated. The Deputy Inspector General has visited and in- spected each of the jails in his division, and reports favourably of their sanitary condition, and of the generally, healthy well-conditioned appearance of the prisoners. The number of prisoners treated in each jail hospital was as follows:26 POLICE HOSPITALS. The average aggregate strength of the police was 7,111; of these 2,448 have been under treatment and 17 died. The police force has been healthy during the year. The Deputy Inspector General reports that he has visited every hospital in his division. At a few stations, such as Dhurrumgaum, a separate and complete hospital exists, but in others, the police are treated in civil hospitals, and in the same ward as the civil patient. Some of the police lines are very indifferent. The Deputy Inspector General quotes the in- stance of Kanara, as being one in which the sepoy requires better and more wholesome dwellings, but is actually worse off in these respects than the men of other districts. The principal diseases treated were as follows:27 NORTHERN DIVISION AND MHOW. CIVIL HOSPITALS. The civil hospitals to be noticed are five: at Ahmadabad, Kaira, Rajkote, Sadra and Dohud. The civil hospital at Ahmadabad has accommodation for 90 patients, and is adapted for the reception of native sick only. There is a small endowment yielding about Rs. 3,000. Other charges are defrayed by Government. For several years past the Civil Surgeon reports the accommodation has been found inadequate for the number seeking admission, and since 1868, buildings outside the city belonging to the municipality have been occupied. They afford room for 40 patients, and are reserved for the chronic and less remediable class of cases, while they afford suitable isolation for lepers and others suffering from inveterate cutaneous affections. There have been 2,171 in-patients treated during the year, with 121 deaths, or 5.5 per cent. Compared with the previous year there has been a falling off in the number treated of 740, due to the fact that it has been necessary to put some restric- tion on the admissions, on account of the limited accommodation in the hospital. The public health continued fairly good throughout the year. Leprosy is a conspicuous disease at this hospital, the daily average number under treatment being 26.4. Dr. Wyllie remarks: " Considering how frequently leprosy is due to hereditary transmission, and the number of diseased mendicants habitually circulating throughout the country, who thus have un- restricted opportunities of perpetuating their loathsome disease, legislative authority in suppression of this form of vagrancy might be interposed beneficently." Civil Hospital, Kaira. There have been but few patients treated in this hospital during the past year, probably in consequence of its imperfect accommo- dation. A new hospital now being built, will, it is anticipated, im- prove the attendance. The number treated during the year was 125, with 13 deaths, or 10.4 per cent. The high death rate is due to the exhausted and an28 There have been 50 large operations during the year, besides many important ones of lesser magnitude; of 37 cases of lithotomy, 35 were cured, 2 died. There was one case of ovariotomy, an operation as yet very rare in this Presidency. At Rajkote the lepers are kept in a hospital under the supervi- sion of the Political Agent and Civil Surgeon. Civil Hospital, Sadra. Forty-one cases have been treated, with 1 death. This is a small hospital, and might better be classed as a dispensary, and is in charge of an intelligent apothecary, Mr. Conway. Civil Hospital, Dohud. This is really the Bheel Corps Hospital, with a ward for civil patients. 42 cases were treated with 6 deaths. Bhooj Hospital. There is, besides the abovementioned civil hospital, a small hos- pital at Bhooj, supported by His Highness the Rao and in charge of a Graduate of the Grant Medical College, who has done some good work during the year. Total treated 283, died 11, or 8.9 per cent. There were 25 large operations during the year, 3 amputations, 22 cases of lithotomy and 2 deaths, besides many others of less impor- tance: amongst them an excellent case of restoration of the nose. Altogether there have been during the year in the civil hospitals under notice 111 first class operations, with 16 deaths or 14.4 per cent. Added to this a large number of miror operations of the utmost im- portance in the relief of suffering; together with some special cases, 1 of ovariotomy29 DISPENSARIES. In the Northern Division and Mhow, there are 25 Dispensaries; and 1,51,535 patients have been treated during the year, with 149 deaths. The number of deaths can have no statistical value, so many patients are returned as "absented" and no further account of them is to be obtained: the nature of the disease and injuries of many of them rendering a fatal result more or less certain. The diseases treated were as follows:30 hospital accommodation. There has been no epidemic during the year, and no sickness calling for remark. Jails. Strength. Treated. Died. Daily average sick.

The number of prisoners treated was 1,016, with 19 deaths, or 1.8 per cent, the percentage of deaths to strength being 1.7. The prin- cipal diseases treated were as follows:31 SIND. CIVIL HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. There has been no change in the number of civil hospitals, of which there are 5, and of dispensaries, there being 23 during the year. The Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals has visited the whole of these institutions during the year, with the exception of the dispen- saries at Nagar Parkar, Mittee and Khetty., The year has been exceptionally healthy, especially as regards malaria. There has been no cholera; small-pox, measles, and hooping cough were prevalent for a time. At Kurrachee principally diseases of the bowels have been frequent, and are probably attributable in a great measure to im- pure drinking water. Stone in the bladder is also common in Sind, and it is supposed may to some extent depend upon a similar cause. In the civil hospitals 1,868 in-patients were treated, and 152 died, being at the rate of 8 per cent. In the dispensaries 1,632 were treated and 115 died, or 7 per cent. of those treated. The principal diseases were as follows:32 Some deaths are known, and have been reported, but the figures are not of any value as representing the actual mortality from dis- eases which in a large number of cases cannot be known. The Deputy Inspector General brings prominently to notice the admir- able working of the civil hospital at Haidarabad, under Assistant Surgeon Holmsted, where 84 important surgical operations have been performed during the year: the number at Kurrachee for the same period being 8 only. Mr. Wright, the Apothecary in charge of the dispensary at Allyarka Tanda, is also specially mentioned. He is, by his intelligence and liking for his professsion, and by his success in the operation of lithotomy, attracting many of the people of the surrounding villages to his dispensary. It is very creditable to Mr. Wright to have overcome the dif- ficulties which were in his way at the outset and to have become, by patient effort, so successful as an operator, as to have acquired the confidence of the people, and in surgery success is the only test of merit amongst an uneducated community. The increase in the attend- ance in civil hospitals and dispensaries over the previous year amounts to 4,332 patients. POLICE. The total strength of the police force is 1,681; of these 1,237 have been treated, and 28 died, or 2.2 per cent. The principal diseases from which the men suffered were:33 The average strength of prisoners in the large jails in Sind during the year was 2,179; total treated 2,569; died 109; giving an average percentage of 4.2 of deaths to treated. The number of deaths to average strength is very large, especially in the Shikarpur jail, amounting to over 7 per hundred. It is quite unusual in the absence of epidemics or any special cause of mortality to find that 7 out of every 100 prisoners died in the year. The ex- planation given by the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals is: "that all healthy able-bodied men are constantly being transferred to other jails, whilst only the feeble, the sickly, and aged prisoners are re- tained at Shikarpur." The average age of the 45 fatal cases at this jail was 41 years and 6 months. Excluding Oomerkote jail, of which there are no returns as to details, the following are the principal diseases from which prisoners suffered:34 ADEN. CIVIL HOSPITAL. The Civil Surgeon repots that the year contrasts favorably with every year since 1862. Total treated 2,770, died 101; giving a per- centage of 3.65 of deaths to treated. The following table gives the results of the last ten years:35 SUMMARY. Having thus examined the work of each medical circle, I now come to summarize the collected results of the year and to make such observations and suggestions as seem to be required and in the order previously noted. 1.36 It is a part of the civilized habits of the European to come readily to a hospital when help is necessary, whilst the Native in many cases only comes when all other means of maintaining the struggle of life have failed. The reports of civil hospitals all agree that the class of persons which contributes most largely to the mortality of the hospitals, is the wandering mendicant class or poor travellers, picked up by the police and sent to the hospital. It is not the best arrangement to have these poor people, often very dirty and repulsive, received into the same ward with the regular patients of a civil hospital. But, practically, there is no other arrangement in most of our civil stations. The most prevalent diseases have been fever, diseases of the lungs, and affections of the surface; and the most fatal, diarrh37 Besides this, there is a Municipal Police Hospital, the strength of the Calcutta Police being 3,000. Total treated 2,019. To compare the amount of medical relief for in-patients in the two cities:38 lished under some one of the different rules now in force regarding dispensaries. There are 4 sets of rules applicable to the dispen- saries in this Presidency:39 The classes of medical officers and subordinates in charge of dispensaries are as follows:40 tainly, if the real value of these men were to be tested by their knowledge of English, many of them now in independent charge would have to be removed. But this has never been the desire of Government, so far as I have been able to gather from office records. Had it been so, teaching medicine and surgery through the medium of the Mahratti language would never have been attempted, but the instruction would have been imparted in English. It is clear then, that, in estimating the value of these men, a high amount of excellence as regards this point cannot be expected. But what are the essential qualifications for the independent charge of a dispensary ? Some of the principal are character, conduct, pro- fessional knowledge, and ability to make this knowledge not only available, but desired by the townspeople when sick. As to character and conduct, considering the class to be a very large one, complaints are singularly few. So that it would seem that given these two cardinal points, and a man may still be inefficient. We have, then, to inquire into his knowledge of his profession; and here there is a difficulty to commence with, that all his professional knowledge has been acquired through one of the vernaculars, not always the man's own, whilst the examining officers who visit the dispensary can only converse in English, which is the dispensary officer's weak point, so that the real value of the man as to professional knowledge has prac- tically to be judged from unreliable data. But there is one test which is infallible, and that is his ability to make his knowledge (which from circumstances may not be tho- roughly or even fairly tested by visiting and inspecting officers) not only available, but desired by the townspeople when sick. At present the last is the only true test of the value of these men as regards the Native public of the dispensary towns, and judged in this way, very many of them are wanting. Indeed, it may be said that most of the men fail to make them- selves popular. They certainly possess a degree of knowledge of medicine and surgery which would be of advantage to any neighbourhood, as compared with the unskilful and barbarous practice of Native ha- keems. But the qualities are wanting which would enable them to take strong ground, except in very rare instances; and when a man is found to possess such qualities, he is generally good enough to be able to look forward to promotion out of the class altogether. But these Hospital Assistants are useful servants of Government; indeed, it is not too much to say that their services are at present indispensable. The hope is, that closer supervision will gradually fit them for a further and more intelligent discharge of these important duties which devolve upon them. The work at the dispensaries during the year has every where in- creased, compared with that of the previous year: the aggregate in- crease in the number of patients according to Table No. 5 being 89.387.
41 Of the diseases treated, there is great uniformity in the returns from the dispensaries in all parts of the Presidency. Slight differences there are, but nothing to affect the general con- clusion, viz., that malarious fever, skin diseases, and various affections of the surface42 kind of accommodation necessary. Probably, as municipalities and local fund committees grow richer, they will become more liberal, and the dispensaries to which they are so closely allied, will, after a time, afford a guage of the general prosperity and progress of the district, as well as of the liberality and intelligence of the district officials. POLICE. The strength of the force in the Presidency during the year has been 14,339; nearly half this number have passed through the hospital. 6,855 have been treated, 88 died, or 1.2 per cent. It will be seen that the men suffer principally from malarious fever; and, considering the nature of their duties requiring them to move about at all seasons in the districts, this is not to be wondered at. They are also in the way of duty exposed to "injuries. " There have been 283 cases and 2 deaths under this head. From the various returns and reports it would appear that the police generally have been healthy, and of the 33 cases of small-pox and 3 cases of cholera recorded, not one was fatal. JAILS. The sanitary condition of the jails in this Presidency, and the general health of the prisoners, have both been good. Fewer men have passed through the hospital than in the preceding year, the decrease being 617. The jails have been very free from epidemic disease. 21 cases of small-pox have been treated, with no death: so that the disease was of a very modified character, the result of vaccination and re- vaccination whenever deemed necessary. Two cases of cholera have been treated43 TABLE No. 1.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CIVIL HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES OF THE PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. The Civil Medical Institutions of the Presidency circle are arranged under the following heads:62 2. In police hospitals no European sick were treated as in-patients. 3. In jail hospitals 79 European in-patients were received under treatment and 2 died, giving a ratio of 2.53 per cent. of deaths to treated. 4. In the lunatic asylum 38 European insanes were treated, without any deaths (these are shown in Form No. 1 under Civil Hospitals). 5. In dispensaries no European in-patients were treated. 6. In the Bombay Marine 193 European in-patients were treated, with one death, yielding a death rate of 0.51 to treated. The general results as regards Native in-patients treated in hos- pitals, under the above heads, in the year 1871-72, are:63 the various classes of dispensaries, and in the year under report 177,966 patients underwent treatment, 150,934 were cured or relieved, 24,481 absented, with 80 deaths, giving a ratio of 0.004 per cent. of deaths to treated. 6. In the Bombay Marine, at the dockyard dispensary, 3,848 cases were treated with 9 deaths, or 0.23 per cent. to treated. The above points are brought out in the following form, and in the accompanying table marked B, the chief diseases are entered:64 from 12.10 in civil, 9.18 in dispensaries, to 0.33 in the ship hospitals, Bombay Marine. The general ratio as regards Europeans does not call for remark at present, but it is different as regards the Native in-patients treated and died, under the hospital headings given above. It will be observed that in those classes of Natives amongst whom sickness is early noticed, such as in jails, police, ships, and lunatic asylum, the death rate assumes a moderate character, according, doubtless, to the celerity with which disease is brought under treatment; but, when the results of treatment in civil hospitals and amongst the in-patients of dis- pensaries is examined, and a total death rate of 12 and 9 per cent. presents itself, we naturally consider and endeavour to ascertain why this is. The consideration does not take long, for the observations of all Civil Medical Officers on the fatal cases occuring in their hos- pitals and dispensaries go to show, that a number of those admitted are admitted only to die: sent in either by the authorities to whom they are a burden, or seeking, themselves, the last shelter open to the distressed. In no hospitals in this Division is this more apparent than in the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, civil hospitals, Tanna, Karwar, and Surat, where the ratio of deaths to treated are 15.06 per cent., 19.48 per cent., 16 per cent, and 8 per cent. It is also to be remembered that Native sick will, generally, try every remedy within reach before they will resort to the last resource, namely, the Hospitals attended by European medical men. The un- suspecting credulity of a sick Native, too, is proverbial, and he will allow many a pretender to experiment on him before he awakens to the fact, that the last chance for his recovery lies in the hospital, which he frequently seeks too late. These are chief causes of the largeness of the mortality ratio in civil Native hospitals, and to only one does there appear to be a possibility of the application of any remedy. In large towns the local authori- ties should have their poor asylums, and medical attendants, no where more requisite than in Bombay, where those, for whom shelter, diet, and attendance, more than medical treatment are re- quired, could be provided for, and so relieve Government from some of the heavy cost that it is at in supporting hospitals in the perform- ance of one of their present functions, viz., that of poor asylums, and by timely relief of this kind, do much to prevent those diseases which destitution undoubtedly produces. In small towns and villages, local authorities should be induced to come more liberally forward to support those who would then seek the shelter of the institutions (dispensaries), which observation of the requirements of their poorer countrymen has led them to assist in the establishment of65 jails, police, and ships, where the strength and total sick are recorded, and where sickness is soon observed, a ratio of diseases is attainable, and taking them as classes, the result obtained is, as below tabulated:66 the lungs; rheumatism gave 1 death; syphilis 1; diseases of the liver gave 61 cases and 7 deaths; a percentage of deaths to treated of 11.47. With reference to Native in-patients of civil hospitals, and their diseases, it is found that out of a total of 7,966, the large number of 1,281, or 16.08 per cent., received treatment for fevers, and that 111 of these died, giving a ratio of deaths to treated of 8.66; of these fevers 1,128, with 93 deaths, were malarial, 8.24 per cent. of deaths to treated. Almost the same course in frequency of disease; but with greater mortality, as amongst in-door European sick, occurs in Natives. Of diseases of the stomach and intestines 1,036 cases sought relief and 262 died, giving a ratio of 25.30 per cent. of deaths to treated; skin diseases were frequent, 80, with 1 death. There were 336 diseases of the heart and lungs, and 66 deaths, or 18 per cent. to treated. Diseases of the liver were 123, with 27 deaths, or 21.90 to treated. Syphilitic disease gave rise to 767 cases and 20 deaths, or 2.6 per cent. to treated. Cholera was not prevalent, but of 26 cases brought under treatment, there were 12 deaths, or a ratio of 46.15 per cent. The remaining deaths occurring in Civil Hospitals arose chiefly from debility, ulcers, nervous system, injuries, other local diseases, poisons, other general diseases, &c. In Jail Hospitals, only two of which at the Presidency have European prisoners, the European sick have been very few. From the diseases in the above table two deaths only took place: from malarial fever 1, and disease of liver 1. The Native sick of Jails have followed much the same course in frequency of disease as in civil hospitals. There were 465 cases of fever and 5 deaths, or 1.07 to treated. Diseases of the stomach and intestines gave 226 and 13 deaths, or 5.75 to treated. Diseases of the liver gave 5 cases and 2 deaths, or 40 per cent. Diseases of the heart and lungs gave 50 cases and 6 deaths, or 12 per cent. to treated; there were 27 cases of rheumatism, 20 of syphilis, 33 of eye disease, and 86 of skin disease, with no deaths. In Police sick no Europeans came under treatment in hospitals. In Natives treated in police hospitals, the same course or sequence in frequency as in civil hospitals and jails is observed. First are fevers, of which 1,057 cases were treated in hospital, with a mortality of 7, a death rate of 0.66 to treated. Considering the duties of the police, and the fact that these are often carried on in most malarious dis- tricts, it is surprising that the treated are not more, and that the death rate from malarial fever should be so small. Of diseases of the stomach and intestines there were 284 treated and 8 died; the ratio of deaths to treated is 2.81. There were 79
67 cases of rheumatism with no deaths; 53 of syphilis with 1 death; 67 diseases of the heart and lungs, with 5 deaths; giving a ratio of 7.46 to treated. Disease of the liver gave 8 cases and 2 deaths, or 25 per cent. to treated. The records of the ship hospitals of the Bombay Marine show that much the same sequence of disease occurs both in Europeans and Natives. In Europeans 52 cases of fevers were treated, with no deaths; 33 cases of diseases of stomach and intestines occurred, with no deaths; 27 of rheumatism, no deaths; 15 of disease of heart and lungs and 1 death; or 6.66 per cent. to treated. Diseases of the liver caused 8 cases without death. There were 5 cases of syphilis, 5 eye diseases, and 4 of skin diseases without death. In Natives68 diseases affecting the health and mortality of the people, judged of from them, are derived from the classes of69 The ratio of deaths to treated cannot be considered in any way re- liable, as in the general treatment of out-door sick a very large number absent themselves; some being cured of their little ailments do not return to inform the medical attendant, others take medicines for a time, and, not getting the quick relief they probably anticipated, or impatient, do not continue, and, if their cases are serious, perhaps eventually die, there is no doubt that there are many of this class. In dispensary practice the results of treatment must often be ex- tremely doubtful, especially when patients seek aid from considerable distances. The fact must not in any way detract from the large amount of good institutions of this kind are able to dispense, and I fully believe that, were every village of a thousand inhabitants supplied with a small dispensary with a few useful medicines, more good would be done than by the erection of one or two in a large, extensive taluka. I advocate most strongly the multiplication of village dispensaries in districts, with Hospital Assistants, and one or two larger with Sub- Assistant Surgeons of good attainments, wherein patients could be treated and counsel sought at times of need; as to seek institutions miles distant from their homes for the less important diseases, puts families to so much inconvenience that, as it is well known, they hesitate to repeat their visits. * Shown in Table D. I need only point out the number of absented shown in dispensary returns* as going far to prove this state- ment. A scheme of this kind, could it be carried out, might have the effect of reducing very considerably in- deed the cost of the extremely expensive Vaccination Establishment, as each Hospital Assistant could conduct the vaccination of the vil- lages, and only in large towns would extra vaccinators be required. To this subject more attention is necessary than can be afforded now, and I only offer these remarks as suggestions which might sub- sequently be considered, and, if carried out, eventually do far more for the salus populi than the present system can possibly perform. The tables accompanying this report will, I trust, help to illustrate the medical and surgical statistics of the Presidency Division for 1871-72. CIVIL HOSPITALS. European General Hospital, Bombay. At my annual inspection of the European General Hospital I found the buildings and offices in as good order as care, and annual and minor repairs enabled them to be kept. The sick were most care- fully attended to. The hospital itself has been the subject of so many reports, gene- rally of unfavourable character, that it is unnecessary almost to repeat that it is a simple make-shift for a hospital for European sick, in a city like Bombay. 9 M D
70 For years past, and each year, it has been hoped by all persons interested in the subject, and they are many, that arrangements would have been ere this completed for the long-promised erection of a new European General Hospital, to take the place of the present: an old military hospital of times gone by, and a converted barrack with its out-houses, forming together a rambling, disconnected series of buildings, unsuited really for the purposes to which they are put on all points, save that of position. Fortunately for the inmates, in this respect it possess a good aspect and fair ventilation. Most of the surroundings of the hospital are highly objectionable, as stated by my predecessors, and the whole arrangements only bearable, under consideration of their temporary character, pending the erection of a new hospital. This new hos- pital was actually commenced in 1863, when the foundations were laid on the part of the Esplanade fronting the main road leading into the Native town from the Fort; this situation was, however, aban- doned, plans and sites have since then undergone various changes; it is now still hoped it will be commenced at an early date, the site selected being, it is supposed, near the old Cooperage on the Esplanade. In my inspection I did not see much that could be remedied in re- ference to the hospital. Two subjects, however, called for particular attention: one was the state of the laboratory, which should be removed from its present position, and the place it now occupies should be converted into a waiting room. The other, the great need for a day-room for those patients who now use the windward verandah, in close proximity to the beds, for smoking, reading, talking, &c., to the serious inconvenience and hurt of those patients for whom quiet is so necessary. I think a tem- porary day-room, for patients not required to be at rest all day, should be provided. It would be vain to recommend any serious alterations which would involve much expenditure without making anything complete; to arrange for such defects as should clearly be attended to, is all that can be done. * For 11 months. The additions or alterations which have been made during the year are noted in the annual report of Dr. Butler, the Acting Surgeon of the Hospital.* Since that report a sanction has been received to the opening of an obstetric ward for European women71 It appears that there was a smaller number of cases treated in the year under report than in the previous year; this may probably be ascribed to decreased trade in the port, to the deportation of desti- tute Europeans, to the establishment of the Government Workhouse, and, to a certain extent, to the Contagious Diseases Act, as the ad- missions for venereal disease were more than a half less than in the previous year. The total number of cases treated in the European General Hospi- tal was 1,162, of which 70 remained from the previous year and 1,092 were fresh admissions; there were, of these, 1,048 discharged, 49 died, 62 remained, 3 transferred. The ratio of deaths to treated was 4.21, being larger than in the preceding year, but considerably less than in previous years. In Dr. Butler's report, accompanying, there are some interesting remarks on hepatic abscess, with a table showing the amount of urea excreted in that disease, and the effect of the administration of chloride of ammonium on this excretion. Dr. Joynt's treatment of delirium tremens by strychnine and nitric acid is pronounced favour- ably on. I append a table of the chief diseases treated in this hospital during the year, and of the mortality occurring from them:72 Dr. Joynt, who returned from England and took charge on the 31st March 1872, does not add anything to Dr. Butler's report. The operations performed during the year have been amputation, forearm 1, of finger 4 = 5. In thus reviewing the report of the Acting Surgeon of the hospital, I regret that there are so few sub- jects of importance to bring to notice. Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital. Founded in 1845, and opened in May of that year, at the joint ex- pense of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, Bart., and Government. In reviewing the annual report of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hos- pital, it appears advisable to correct, or rather alter, the table with which it is commenced as, including the sick treated in the Cowasjee Jehangeer Opthalmic Hospital., it would convey an erroneous impres- sion of the admissions, &c., of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital per se. This is alluded to by the Acting First Physician in a subse- quent sentence, where he says, as regards the treated, "this number includes 519 patients treated in the Cowasjee Jehangeer Hospital; * * the ratio of mortality will be increased by excluding the Opthal- mic Hospital sick, as no deaths occurred." The table will therefore stand as follows, understanding it as simply a statistical table of sickness, having no reference to diets, medicines, &c., supplied by the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital to the Opthalmic Hospital as well as to its own particular patients, for which purpose the table given by the First Physician would answer:73 pears that the chaulmoogra ( Ch. Odorata v. Gynocardia Odarata v. Hydrocarpus odoratus) oil keeps its place in the estimation of the officer who conducts the treatment; he considers it as first in efficacy. Dr. Beauperthuy's remedy has been tried, not exactly as advised by Dr. Bakewell; as used, however, it has failed, and it is difficult to understand how, unaided by constitutional treatment, it could do otherwise in its simple action as a local stimulant. The remarks concerning this disease appear to me to be very worthy of record. I would also commend to notice the notes on abscesses of the liver and the statement of the Acting First Physician that urea is, contrary to the observations of Dr. Parkes, formed in the urine of patients labouring under hepatic abscess. This accords with the experiments made in the European General Hospital by Dr. Butler, to which attention has already been drawn. The table and remarks on cases of tetanus too are interesting and important, if not satisfactory, as regards results which are as follows:74 A large number of poison cases were treated, 257, during the year. To the 3rd Physician's table of these and remarks I would draw attention as well worthy of record. The Obstetric Institution, under the charge of Surgeon Major Ward, has been of much service during the year. 90 labours occurred in hospital, of which 29 were natural with no deaths to mothers, and 31 were difficult, preternatural, complex or premature. Of these, 3 women only died; the results to children were that out of 59 natural labour cases, 6 children died; of the others, 25 died. Dr. Ward's remarks and the state of some cases, when brought to hospital, especially shown in one case of preternatural labour, simply point out how terrible the treatment of labours, beyond the common, is, when undertaken by Native midwives. To educate the class of midwives, or women undertaking such duties, who attend the poor in their labours, presents great difficulties; but as medical practi- tioners increase, it will gradually become known that "doctors" are able to assist in difficult cases, and these women should be made to understand that a "doctor" should be called in. Punishment, if there is any legal, should be brought to bear on these persons, when such a result attends their work as is pointed out in Dr. Ward's report. At my visits to the J. J. Hospital, and at my inspection, I was fully satisfied with the hospital and its general management, with the exception of the system relating to stores, that is to say, the bedding, clothing, dead stock, articles of diet, &c. These are all placed under the charge of one man, called a first class purveyor, on Rs. 45 per month, the 1st Physician of the Hos- pital being considered responsible for the whole. The 1st Physician of this large hospital, recollecting that he is also the head of a division of the Educational Department, in the duties of which a considerable portion of his time is occupied, should, I venture to suggest, be freed from this charge; indeed none of the medical staff should be in any way connected with it. In military hospitals the surgeon is freed from all responsibility, except for the articles as drawn from the purveyor, and for those ac- tually under use in the hospital. The Commissariat is the provider, on whom the purveyor indents for his daily supplies, and under which department he is, the medical officer making requisitions on him. It is widely different in these large civil hospitals, for, since Circular Order No. 3 of 1871-72 from the Commissary General, the medical officer indents and procures, his supplies, he then becomes responsible for all; the store is a hospital store under the physi- cian, not a Commissariat store under the Commissariat and their servants. Such trust must be placed in the purveyor in the case of the J. J. Hospital by the 1st Physician, as is quite incompatible with
75 the pay and position of the man, and though this system has still for the present to be carried on, I am of opinion that it should be changed. There should be a storekeeper to the hospital, who should be in- dependent of all officers, except the 1st Physician, having rules laid down for his guidance, which the 1st Physician would see carried out, and report any occurrences requiring notice to the Deputy In- spector General. This officer, the storekeeper, should purchase the articles required, either by contract or in such manner as would be most serviceable to the interests of the hospital and Government, under the sanction of the Deputy Inspector General, and samples of all articles of bed- ding, clothing, furniture, food, &c., to be procured, should be sub- mitted to a Committee of hospital officers for approval; everything belonging to the hospital should be placed in his charge, and the servants, such as cooks, dhobies, and others connected with the supply of the hospital, should be placed under him, always in every- thing subject to the 1st Physician's control and the authority of the Deputy Inspector General. There should be a Committee as often as the 1st Physician might consider it advisable or when asked for by the storekeeper. The storekeeper should have a first class purveyor under him with the usual servants. With some such arrangements, only sketched here, the result would, without doubt, be satisfactory to Government: if the Inspector General agrees with me the subject may at once be taken up. The store room is an ill-ventilated place, quite insufficiently light- ed; it should be lighted with gas. The male dispensary has no waiting room sufficient for the accom- modation of the patients, and altogether is ill adapted to the purpose it has to fulfil, particularly is it ill suited in the rainy and cold seasons, when shelter to sick is so desirable, nay so really needed. The servants' houses, or rather the wreched huts, where only a part of them reside, are so inferior and in every way so objectionable as to call for early attention. They have been reported on frequently, but the proposals to place them on ground which would have to be pur- chased, and so rid the hospital compound of the nuisance, have not been attended to. I would now propose that the requirements for attending the dispensary and re-arranging the out-houses should be submitted to Government, with a request that a committee should be formed to investigate them and report on what it is really necessary to be done. There can be only one opinion as to the necessity of some arrangement being made for the out-houses to enable all the servants to reside on the premises, and at the same time to have some little regard paid to sanitary laws. The light buildings for cholera and small-pox which have proved of much utility, abut on the large cattle ground, between which and them there is a wall which is much lower than it ought to be and
76 very ruinous; to heighten this appears to be necessary. The reports of the establishments have been favourable throughout the year. In submitting the annual report and that for three months, I would beg to state that there are some points in them that might bear being published in the transactions of the Bombay Medical and Physical Society. It should be added here that my predecessor adverted to the dis- pensary for making up medicines, and in his remarks I perfectly agree, and consider the subject is one very worthy of the attention of the Inspector General for recommendation for alteration, if it can be satisfactorily arranged for. The dispensary is in excellent order, but not being all in one place, direct supervision cannot be carried out. Surgeon Major Hunter, 1st Physician to the hospital, proceeded to Europe and delivered over charge of the J. J. Hospital on the 20th October 1871 to Surgeon J. H. Sylvester. Surgeon Stedman pro- ceeded on furlough on the 10th May, his place of 2nd Physician being taken by Surgeon Cook, who joined on the 2nd June 1871. The 2nd Surgeon to the hospital, Assistant Surgeon Knapp, proceeded on sick leave on the 18th February, and was relieved by Surgeon G. Y. Hunter on the 18th April 1871. Cowasjee Jehangier Opthatmic Hospital. The Cowasjee Jehangier Opthalmic Hospital continues to main- tain its position as a most beneficial and successful charity. Its use- fulness to all classes of the people of Bombay cannot be too highly considered; as an institution it reached a high position under Mr. Sylvester, and under Dr. Maconachie I trust it will continue to re- tain it. The old grievance of the Cowasjee Jehangier Opthalmic Hospital still remains77 The hospital has one great additional fault, which I cannot too strongly urge on the consideration of the Inspector General, and that is the absence of quarters for the hospital assistant. At night and when absent for meals, &c., there is no responsible person present beyond Native medical pupils and, as these are also without quarters, they may be absent likewise. For the out-houses there is ground sufficient close to the hospital, for quarters for the Assistant and pupils none that, as far as I can see, is available. My own impression is that the male dispensary and vaccination buildings, which are as ill fitted as they can be for their purposes, should be handed over to the Opthalmic Hospital, and a new dispen- sary and vaccination offices be built in some equally accessible parts of the grounds of the Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital. The number of patients that remained last year was 37: there were admitted 482, total treated 519; of these 491 were discharged, 28 re- mained. The chief diseases treated were:78 which are of considerable extent. Opposite the main church en- trance to the N. W. is the hospital, which is an upper-storied build- ing, with offices and dwelling rooms for matrons, &c., below. There is a set of rooms for the boys' hospital, and a set for the girls. The arrangements are very good. On the boys' side there are two large and one small room, with ample cubical measurement and with space for about 40 cots. When I paid my inspection visit measles prevailed; the wards were chiefly occupied by boys suffering from the disease. The health of the boys has been, with the exception of this attack, good. 60 cases of simple fever were treated, 60 discharged cured. Measles, 24 were treated and discharged well. Conjunctivitis, 35 treated, 35 discharged well. Surgeon Partridge, in medical charge, points out that the most of these cases are purposely induced, by insertion of lime, &c. This disease is entirely confined to the boys ! 14 cases of bronchitis were treated, and 14 discharged. 5 cases of dysentery in boys admitted, and 5 cured. Scabies has, I regret to observe, been frequent; 11 remained, 57 were admitted, and 67 discharged; no remarks have been made as to the cause of this disease. Girls' Hospital.79 It appears that the rules for the management and inspection of this hospital were sanctioned early in September 1870, the establish- ment was entertained and the Lock Hospital then commenced to re- ceive its patients. During the year, from 1st April 1871 to 31st March 1872, the average daily number of prostitutes in hospital under treatment was 101, the total treated during the year being 700; of these there were 410 in hospital for actual contagious disease, the remainder, 289, from diseases incidental to prostitutes' occupation, such as ulceration of os uteri, &c. Previous to its being closed I had twice inspected the hospital and was satisfied that the treatment of the sick was attended to, and that the patients were, generally, by no means disinclined to be taken care of in their ailments. The hospital is to be closed on the 31st March. This is of course a matter of much regret: such an institution would have gradually be- come of the utmost service in such a populous and mercantile city. Looking at the establishment of this hospital only as a tentative measure, it was not allowed to remain long enough to disclose its faults, to remedy shortcomings, or enable suggestions for alteration or improvements to be made. There is no doubt it did good to a certain extent, the amount of which might perhaps be not at first appreciable, owing to the short existence of the hospital. The cases admitted, however, clearly shew that venereal disease prevails to a considerable extent in the city of Bombay, as might be expected; the number received during the year can only be looked upon as a small portion of the diseased. It is a pity, indeed, that the Lock Hospital, Bombay, has been so soon abandoned. The deaths occuring in the hospital were chiefly from dysentery and diarrh80 The report beyond this does not require comment. At my in- spection I found the hospital in good order in every way. The dispensary and police hospital are separately reported on. Carwar. The Civil Hospital is a mere shed which, on the early re- establishment of the place, was put up at the spot near to where work-people and others were most located. The town has now ex- tended entirely in the contrary direction and, being only in proxi- mity to the travellers' bungalow, and to a few of the houses of the residents, the present civil hospital is, as regards situation, entirely misplaced. In other points, it is almost needless to repeat from for- mer reports, it does not fulfil the requirements; but this need not be dwelt on now, as it is understood a design for a new hospital has been prepared and a site selected to the south of the Kalee Nuddee, on the northern portion of the sandy plain, on which the town is extending on the south and east. The new jail is to be also built in this position. A review of the Civil Surgeon's return and report shews that the climate of Carwar, as regards temperature, is much as that of Bom- bay. The greatest temperature, registered by the Civil Surgeon be- ing 92º in May and June, and the lowest 69º. The rain-fall is considerable, having during last season, which gave scanty registra- tion over the whole Presidency, been 79 inches 94 cents. The total number treated during the year as in-patients was 106; of these 7 remained from the preceding year, 99 were fresh admis- sions, 17 died and 2 remained; 16 per cent. of deaths to treated. There were more treated than in the preceding year. The largest number of admissions of disease was from fever, giv- ing 22 per cent. on the whole; these were almost all complicated with diseased spleen and dropsy: no deaths occured. Many persons much exposed to malarious influence do not shew it in attacks of fever, but in general malaise and debility. Dysentery gave ten cases, all of long standing; there were four deaths. At my inspection I found everything in order, the subordinate establishment attentive and favorably reported on. The report of the Civil Surgeon is meagre and affords nothing novel to bring under review: there are no particular points to bring to the notice of the Inspector General. Tanna. The chief point to notice in the annual report of the Civil Surgeon at Tanna, is the statement concerning the admission of cases of dysentery and diarrh81 The mortality, taken from the Civil Surgeon's returns, from these diseases82 to the full action of the sun's glare during the dry season, and to the wind and rain of the monsoon. The Civil Surgeon considers venetians are required to the arches, and I quite agree in the desirability of this and other matters being attended to. Suggestions to this effect were made by the predecessor of the present Civil Surgeon in 1864. I will quote a remark made by the Civil Surgeon concerning the mortality, which amongst in-patients was 35 out of 428, or 8.17 per cent. to treated: "With reference to the mortality I need only remark that a large portion of the patients who seek admission into the hospital do so as the only means they have of obtaining food. From the severity of their diseases they are pronounced incurable by the Hakeems, and when they are disabled from begging food in the streets, many merely come into hospital as a place where they know they can die in tolerable comfort." 22 of the deaths out of 35 occurred from debility, that is in persons brought to hospital in a dying state. From the annual return I gather that there were treated as in-pa- tients of the Civil Hospital 428, of whom 45 remained from the pre- vious year's returns, 383 were fresh admissions, of these 365 were discharged, 35 died, 28 remained under treatment. The temperature registered in this hospital was highest in the month of April, when it was 94°, the lowest in January, when it was 64. The rainfall was 22 in. 80 cents, the average fall for 10 years was 34 inches. At my inspection the hospital was in a satisfactory state, except in the points noted at the commencement of the review of the Civil Surgeon's report. The subordinate establishments were effective, and no complaints were made. Broach. It is pleasing to record of this flourishing municipal town, with a population of 36,479, that at last its new hospital, alike a most use- ful structure and an ornament to the place, is completed; it was on the 14th August 1871 opened to the public. I am not acquainted with the manner in which it was arranged that a new hospital should be erected, but the cost of the building was Rs. 67,000, and this sum was met from the following sources:83 The description of the building is given by Assistant Surgeon Cook, M.D., in Medical charge. At my visit of inspection I was satisfied with most of the arrangements; a few, however, were so obvi- ously defective that they could not help being observed, and recom- mendations for their alteration have been or will be submitted. The defects are noticed by the Civil Surgeon in his report, I will reproduce the most important here. It is evident that the original plan was not fol- lowed, for in it the female ward is separate.84 proceed by aggravation of disease previously contracted. They are brought to hospital, as a rule, in a state which renders treatment a very serious matter, and very often all but hopeless: amongst this class dysentery, diarrhæa, ague, remittent fever are commonly found- "2nd (showing want of small dispensary)-People from the vil- lages in the district suffering from some serious disease or injury, who, having tried all available remedies in vain, come to the hospital as a last resource." The highest temperature registered was in April, 100°, in May and June 99° the lowest 56° in January and February. The rainfall was 19 in. 14 cents., a registration which is said to have been scanty. No epidemic dieases prevailed. An active Medical Officer here has, soon, as much as he can do in medicine and surgery, particularly the latter, and I trust to see, un- der Dr. Cook's charge, a great addition to the good previously done by the civil hospital dispensary, as there is now this excellent build- ing open for the reception of the sick of the district. POLICE HOSPITALS. Tanna. Colaba. Ratnagiri. Vengurla. Surat. Sawantwari. Carwar. Honore. Broach. Tanna. The Tanna police hospital adjoins the Tanna civil and regimental Hospitals, and is provided with medicines, attendance, and medical requisites from the civil hospital. The strength of the Police on the 1st April 1871, was 1,118. Died in hospital 10 Sent on sick certificate 22 Discharged at their own request 62 Transferred 1 Discharged by C. 0. 25 Invalided 3 123 I extract this table from the Civil Surgeon's report, to point out how much any medical statistical data of police must be vitiated where the causes of so many discharges from the corps are unknown. The strength shown to remain is 826, which does not tally with the remainder of the table given by the Civil Surgeon. As usual ague was the chief disease treated. There remained from previous returns 18, there were 419 fresh ad- missions, total treated 437; of these 414 were discharged, 10 died, 13 remained under treatment.
85 In his history of diseases under treatment the Civil Surgeon states of one, abcess of the liver, which recovered after early puncture, that it is "the only case on record of an abscess pointing towards the ribs that has been opened and has recovered." Guinea-worm appears to be somewhat frequent due, the Civil Surgeon states, to using the well-water of the districts where dracuaculus is endemic. Surgeon Atkins states the health of the Police was not so good as in the previous year. The corps is employed over the Tanna Collectorate, many parts of which are highly malarious, and there are, doubtless, many who suffer attacks of fever who do not show their diseases; to assist such I had recommened that they should be made to attend at dispen- saries when sick and receive treatment. Ratnagiri. The strength of this corps at head quarters was 373: there were 151 treated, of whom 6 were remained from previous return, and 145 were fresh admissions; of these 145 were discharged, 2 died, and 4 remained. There is no discharge history of the corps such as given by the Civil Surgeon, Tanna; in all such corps many men are discharged during the year, some probably for sickness which, as I stated in the analysis of ratio of sickness and deaths to strength, would enhance the police returns of sick. The chief diseases were as usual ague, one case of which termi- nated fatally. Next in point of number were diseases of the stomach and intes- tines, chiefly diarrh86 The mortality was 3, one from ague, two from debility. The police hospital is a ward of the civil hospital and is alluded to in the report. Kárwár. The police hospital of the North Kanara Police Corps is a separate building, situated at a considerable distance from the civil hospital and jail, at the opposite side of the town of Kárwár, on the sandy plain to the south of the Kallee Nuddee, near the town. The lines of the police are in close proximity to it. At the period of my visit to Kárwár there were far more sick than the hospital was destined to contain. The hospital was built after a design of a Police Superintendent, the Medical authorities not being consulted: it is imperfect and peculiar. The Civil Surgeon reports that the police force has been more healthy in the year under report than usual. There were 525 treated, of whom 19 remained from the previous year, and 506 were fresh admissions; of these 509 men were discharg- ed, 4 died, and 12 remained under treatment. The chief cause of admission was ague, of which 121 were under treatment, giving a ratio percentage to treated of 23.04. Diseases of stomach and intestines gave 28 cases and 3 deaths. The total mortality was four; giving a ratio of 0.7 to treated and of 1.3 to strength. The hospital was carefully attended to and clean. A Hospital Assistant is attached to it. Broach. In the report of the Broach Police submitted by the Civil Sur- geon, Assistant Surgeon Cook, M.D., he states that the strength from which he receives patients into his hospital is 281, the total being 358; the sick from the remaider are supposed to receive medical aid at the various dispensaries. The sick treated at Broach are admitted into the police ward of the new civil hospi- tal, which was opened on the 14th August, where there is cubic space for 8 beds. There were 142 treated in the year, of which 4 remained from the previous year and 139 were fresh admissions; of these 135 were dis- charged, 3 died, and 4 remained. Dr. Cook states: "The discipline of the police ward has been very bad, the sick have been in the habit of leaving the hospital for their food, and receiving their friends and their visitors at all hours at the hospital, which bids fair to become a lounge for all the idlers in the lines and vicinity. This has been in a great measure stopped by the aid of the Police Superintendent and in a short time still greater im- provements may be accomplished."
87 The chief disease was ague. The highest temperature was 100º in April, the lowest 56º in January and February. The rainfall was 19 inches 14 cents, the greatest fall was 2 inches 34 cents in August. Dr. Cook reports the lines where the police live to be imperfect. Kolala88 The strength of the detachment was 52; there were 69 treated, of which 1 remained from previous year, 68 were fresh admissions; of these 68 were discharged, none died and 1 remained. Nothing of importance appears to have occurred during the year. Sawantwari Local Police Corps. The sick of this Corps are treated in the very excellent civil hospital under the medical charge of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Burjorjee Ardaseer. Strength of the Corps 466 ( 1 European ). The number treated was 205, of whom 7 remained from the preced- ing year, and 198 were freshadmissions; of these 199 were discharged, 1 died, and 5 remained. The chief disease was ague, 111 cases of which were treated. There was one death in the year from remittent fever. The police ward was at the period of my inspection in good order. JAIL HOSPITALS. The Jail Hospitals in the Presidency Division are89 Here also operations were performed with success. There were treated in the House of Correction hospital 67 Euro- peans, 72 Natives; with 2 deaths European, 3 Native. During the year vagrants have been accommodated, and the sick- ness amongst them was considerable; a ward of the hospital was set apart for some, whilst others were treated as out-patients. 24 vagrants at the end of the year were in the work-house. The urgent need for a contagious disease ward still exists. During the year one or two cases were obliged to be sent to the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital. In both the Jail and House of Correction the diets have been ex- perimentally reduced, both in Europeans and Natives, without any ill result. The sanitary character of the House of Correction was attended to carefully. Tanna. Strength, average, 632; average sick 17.34 daily. Total treated 475; of these 449 were discharged, 15 died, one out of hospital. The percentage of treated to strength was 75.63 and of deaths to treated 2.93. The chief diseases were intermittent fever, of which there were 195 with 5 deaths. The ratio of fever cases per cent. to strength was 30.85 or to total treated 41.05. Dysentery and diarrh90 The general health of the prisoners has been good throughout the year. The strength was 234, the Civil Surgeon states that this number is in excess, 86, over the cubic space allowed. The chief diseases were ague and diseases of the stomach and in- testines. I went over the whole jail and attentively examined it. It was in excellent order and evidenced considerable attention being paid to the sanitary requirements. The prisoners looked healthy. The hospital was clean. Karwar. The health of this jail was satisfactory during the year, and the sickness of slight character, calling "for no special remarks." There remained from previous returns 9, there were 136 fresh ad- missions, making a total of 145; of these 138 were discharged, 3 died, 4 remained under treatment. The strength of the jail was 110.4 and the ratio of treated to strength 131.8. I would have described this jail, but as a new jail is about being built, it is needless doing so. It is necessary to say that the health of the prisoners was well attended to in the sanitation of the jail. Sawantwari. Into the jail hospital, which is a small, hot room, there were admit- ted in the year under report 34 sick prisoners, I remained from pre- vious returns, making a total treated of 35; the whole of these were discharged cured. The chief disease was ague. The percentage of treated to strength of all diseases was 84.5. I found on my inspection the jail clean. LUNATIC ASYLUM, BOMBAY. During the year under report two new wings have been sanction- ed for the lunatic asylum, for the accommodation of male and female lunatics. This sanction does not appear to have been accord- ed too soon, as there is an increased demand for accommodation of persons of insane mind. These wings were commenced in March, but will not be terminated until June; they are to afford accom- modation for 50 males and 50 females. The Superintendent, in his annual report, goes into some detail on the various points in con- nection with this most useful addition to the premises, and accom- panies it with a plan. It is to be hoped that the increased space at disposal will enable the Superintendent to inaugurate a system of classification, or, at any rate, to take steps towards its future accomplishment. This is
91 a great necessity in this asylum, and one which will be of service not only in the treatment of the insane, but in decreasing the cost of maintenance. I think it very advisable to bring to prominent notice a few portions of the report. First "regarding the" previous particulars of the history of insanes." The Superintendent endorses a statement made by Dr. Niven, to the effect that " no particulars regarding the history of persons sent to the asylum under Section IV. are ever furnished by the Magistrates or Commissioners of Police, and the medical certificates, according to Form A, give very scanty informa- tion regarding the alleged lunatics. " The consequence is, it is almost impossible to ascertain the cor- rect age of the lunatics, or the length of time they have been insane, or to assign the probable cause for the mental disease." Dr. Shepherd considers "good might result from medical officers giving the fullest information and every particular that can be obtain- ed of the case." The Superintendent's remarks on the supply of Vehar water are suggestive as to the position of the asylum, with reference to the Bombay Municipality, and in recommending means of reducing the expenditure by Government, are worthy of much consideration. I quite agree with the necessity that exists for a sanction being given for a small fire engine to be kept in the premises, and have desired the Superintendent to ascertain the cost. I have also, with reference to the cost of a stove for cooking purposes, its arrangement and probable saving, requested the Superintendent to inform me previous to taking any further steps. At my visits to the asylum and at my annual inspection, I have found, in all matters, the greatest order prevailing. The attendants always amongst the patients and, as far as I could observe, kindness and patient attendance given. There have been no complaints during the year; the management reflects much credit on the Superintendent. The Apothecary of the Asylum, Mr. Rodrigues, has performed his duties satisfactorily; the Matron and Overseers have also been favour- ably remarked on by Dr. Shepherd, and of the remaining 2nd class servants none have been reported against to me. One, in the matter of an escape, was, without my sanction, summarily dismissed by the Superintendent. One full escape took place and one partial one, both of which are referred to. At the commencement of the year there remained under treatment 225 patients (184 males, 41 females). There were fresh admissions 65 (55 males, 10 females), making a total of 290 treated during the year; of these 11 natives died (8 males, 3 females), 24 were discharg- ed cured (19 males and 5 females); 5 were removed (1 male and 1 female improved, 3 males no better); 33 Europeans were sent to
92 England. The average of deaths to treated including Europeans was 3.79 but as no deaths occurred amongst the latter, the percent- age on Natives treated will be 4.36. Apart from the mental disease from which all suffer, 164 cases of bodily ailments were brought under treatment. According to table 12, Appendix B of report, there remained under treatment 20 cases: there were admitted 138, making a total treated of 158, of these 127 were discharged cured, 11 died (as above), and 20 remain- ed. The chief diseases were febricula, epilepsy, bronchitis, dy- sentery, diarrh93 DISPENSARIES. The Dispensaries of the Presidency Division over which Govern- ment has more or less control and authority, amount to thirty-four, and occupy positions where the requirements for such institutions have, with the increasing desire for an improved system of medical relief, from time to time called for their establishment. Wherever these institutions have been established, it appears, from the annual returns, that much good has been done in the relief of sickness, and under a more frequent and improved superintendence there seems room for supposing that the benefits they are now able to afford may be considerably increased. During the past official year only one dispensary has been added to the list, namely in "Pen," a town in the Collectorate of Alibag. Having shown the general results attending the work of the dis- pensaries, it may not be without some utility to point out their clas- sifications, and endeavour to give a short history, as correctly as possible, of each. The dispensaries are divided into three classes: 1st.94 medical aid is distant and difficult of access. Indeed, even with the civil hospitals and the dispensaries, in the Southern Koncan medi- cal aid is far from reach, and there is need for the establishment of more dispensaries to complete a circle of medical institutions. Along the base of the Western Ghauts and its spurs, as may be seen in the accompanying sketch, there is not a single dispensary. The towns of Chiplun, Khed, Rajapur, &c., may be pointed out as fitting places for their establishment. Along the coast from Alibag to Dapuli, which latter place is nine miles inland, there is at present no dispensary; from Dapuli to Ratnagiri none; (at Goa there are medical practitioners), at Ven- gurla there is an apothecary, at Karwar a Surgeon and a charitable dispensary, at Coompta a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, and at Honore a Hospital Assistant. The dispensaries of the 1st and 2nd class should also, according to the regulations, be able to admit a few in-patients, but some of them are unable to do so, as, destitute of means to build proper dispensaries, the authorities have only been able to rent houses which, in some instances, are too small for this purpose, or even for the correct performance of dispensary duties. First Class Dispensaries. The only dispensary of the 1st class which is established in the Presidency Division, is that situated at Kalliawaree, a small town of 1,500 inhabitants, in the Surat Collectorate. At the death of Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, the first Baronet, a sum of Rs. 75,000 was proposed to be set apart by his widow for the endow- ment of a dispensary at the large and populous town of Nausari, in the territory of the Gaikwar of Baroda, the birth-place of her late husband; out of this sum 10,000 rupees was to provide for the building, and the interest of 65,000 rupees for the maintenance of the Dispensary, to be named the " Victoria," in honour of Her Majesty the Queen. The Government sanctioned the proposition and granted ground for the purpose at Kalliawaree, within tolerably easy dis- tance of Nausari, Kalliawaree being in British territory. The situation of the dispensary being on rising ground, with a road- less valley between it and the town of Nausari, rendered access to it difficult, and necessitated the construction of a road 1½ miles long, which was paid for by the Dowager Lady Jamsetjee Jejee- bhoy and the Government, the former giving the additional sum of Rs. 18,376, the latter Rs. 3,766 for the purpose. The dispensary was opened in September 1863, and has proved of great benefit to the surrounding country. This dispensary has a fair character in the district, in which many villages are situated, and from all of which the sick apply for out-door relief; the building, besides possessing the requisite means for providing for dispensary work, also has room for a few in-door male and female patients. The accommodation for the residence of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon is so very insufficient that he has for some years resided, under sanction of the Deputy Inspector General, I

95 presume, in Nausari, where, I believe, he has practice amongst the prosperous traders of the place. At my annual inspection I was not favourably impressed with the Sub-Assistant Surgeon's attention; there can be no doubt that he ought to live at the Dispensary. Two Native Medical Pupils reside in it. Though Nowsaree is, in my opinion, too distant for the Medical Officer's residence, there is no doubt his presence there is beneficial, but what is required is that ample time should be given to the dispensary work, which is now hurried over to a certain extent. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon informed me that he spent much of his time at the dispensary, but I am in- clined to think, his books and papers being kept in Nausari, that the greater part is spent away from it. I did not press the necessity of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon living at the dispensary under the circumstances, but I instructed him to do all his work and bring his books there, and employ his time more in looking after his dispen- sary, and attracting patients by his industry, than in seeking practice in Nausari. Future inspection will prove whether these instruc- tions have been attended to. In the official year 1871-72 there were 6,293 patients treated, 6,185 of whom were new admissions, and 108 remained from the previous year; 5,941 were discharged, cured or relieved, 239 absented, and 113 remained. The average daily number of attendence was 67, no deaths are recorded. Included in the above are 39 in-patients, of whom 35 were fresh admissions; the average daily number of in- patients was 3.5. There were 37 discharged and 2 remaining. The chief diseases, numerically, were intestinal parasites, the ascaris lumbricoides, and ague; of the former 671 cases and of the latter 643 cases were treated: there were also 214 of simple con- tinued fever, 93 remittent fever, and 3 of typhoid. The proportion of ague cases to treated was 10.20, of fever generally 15.10. Vac- cination was carried on, as reported by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, under much difficulty, the population of Kalliawaree being small and in Nausari the Gaikwar's vaccinators being at work. 123 successful operations are recorded to have been performed. During the year the maximum temperature observed was 97º in the month of June, the minimum 58º in the month of December, the highest maximum mean was 92º in June, the lowest minimum mean 60º in December. Rain fell in July, August, and September to the extent of 13 inches 11 cents, and in December 22 cents were guaged. Owing to the promotion of the present Sub-Assistant Surgeon to the 2nd class, the interest of the endowment has fallen short of the expenditure, and there is a debt accumulated against it; unless the Sir Jamsetjee family advance further means, it appears advisable that the removal of the present officer should be effected. I am in- clined to think that changes in these appointments would result favourably in other respects.
96 Six cases to illustrate the practice of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jam- setjee Byramjee, G.G.M.C., are forwarded with the annual return. Mr. Jamsetjee Byramjee's annual report falls short of what I should have expected from an officer of his experience and apparent intelligence. 339 operations, chiefly minor, were performed during the year, but are not mentioned in his report, which is confined to numerical state- ments and barren remarks on routine treatment. 2nd Class Dispensaries. Coorla. Kallian. Karwar. Uran. Balsar. Bhewndy. Bandora. Randir. Paruk. Tanna. Coorla. A village situated on the high road leading from Bombay to Tanna and Vehar; the estate of Coorla belongs to Mr. Bomanjee Hormusjee Wadia, who in 1855 made application to Government for the establishment and endowment of a dispensary on his property for the benefit of the surrounding villages in Salsette, the inhabitants of which at times suffered much from the ravages of small-pox and fever. For this purpose Mr. Bomanjee Hormusjee Wadia agreed to pay Rs. 12,000 to Government for investment, so that the interest should go towards the maintenance of the charity. Mr. Bomanjee Hormusjee Wadia provided a house, and the dispensary was opened in 1855. In 1860 a suitable building was erected at the expense of Mrs. Meetabhaie Hormusjee, this, situated at the junction of the old and new Tanna roads, is a well-constructed building, but not afford- ing sufficient accommodation for the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. The pay of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon is defrayed by Government, also that of the Native Medical pupils, and a contingency of Rs. 17 per month; the rest of the payments are made from the funds of the endowment. The dispensary lies to the west of the Coorla station of the G. I. P. Railway, distant about 2 miles. At my annual inspection I found the dispensary contained 4 central rooms, with verandah rooms at each end, north and south, and open verandahs, east and west; these open verandahs are large and well suited for waiting patients, of whom very few indeed were present during the five hours I spent at the dispensary; of the rooms one appeared to be used as a receiving room, one as a place for keeping medicine and preparing prescrip- tions, one room was apparently for in-patients, of which class very few or none enter, the fourth room was occupied by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon; of the two verandah rooms, one was the sleeping room of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, the other was crammed with lumber and private stores in the greatest disorder; adjoining these verandah rooms are bath rooms and offices, one set apart for the Sub-Assistant
97 Surgeon, the other for in-patients; the latter was filled with pigeons, fowls, and lumber98 gular access is now obtained by a steam ferry, is separated from the mainland by tidal creeks which leave much marshy land exposed as the tides fall. The island consists of two hills with an intersecting valley, it is of trap formation intersected by dykes of black basalt, and thrown up into the two " mountains " already mentioned. The population of Karinja is 14,353. The dispensary at this place is one of the earliest established in the Presidency, and dates as far back as 18 , when a sum of Rs. 11,000 was funded by Mr. Manoel De Souza, formerly a Mamlutdar of Tanna, he also provided the house for the dispensary. The interest of this sum was to provide for all expenditure, except salaries which, and a contingent monthly allowance of Rs 17, are defrayed by Govern- ment. The house occupied as a dispensary is situated in the centre of the town; its unfitness in its present state for dispensary pur- poses has, I understand, been frequently reported, and been the sub- ject of much correspondence, which I have not seen. I can add my testimony to its state, and would suggest that attention should be early attracted to it, and to the need for some improvement being set on foot, if the funds of the institution will permit, or local or other aid can be afforded. The Civil Surgeon states: "in March 1866 the buildings generally were reported to be in a dilapidated condition, and since then, till the present time, a voluminous correspondence between the several authorities regarding its repairs has taken place. " The average daily attendance has risen from 15 in 1865 to 30 in 1871, the increase dates from 1869. The number treated was 2,750, of which 2,715 were fresh admissions, 35 remained from the previous year; of these, 2,402 were cured or relieved, 291 absented, 11 deaths were returned, and 46 remained; out of the total, 857 were cases of malarial fever (ague), being 31.16 per cent. In the previous year the total treated was 1,165, from which it has risen to 2,750. There were no in-patients admitted, there being no place set apart for their accommodation. Besides the defective character of the building itself, there is a want which should be undoubtedly supplied either by Government, or the Municipality, or Local Funds, and that is, the building of a dead-house. At present post-mortem examinations are conducted in the cattle-pound. I need hardly comment on the incorrectness of a medical man being thus exposed when performing a duty requiring great attention, and which should be, for obvious reasons, a strictly private operation. There were 15 post-mortem examinations of a medico legal charac- ter performed at Uran during the year under report. The patients applying at the dispensary appeared to be well attended to; during the period of my stay I saw the full average number. Mr. Gonsalves, Sub-Assistant Surgeon in medical charge, is an intelligent officer, and has done much for the sanitary improvement of the place; the large, handsome tank which was used for every purpose, both for man and animal, and was the fertile source of guinea-worm, is now
99 not allowed to be entered. The streets are taken care of, and the small market-place kept clean. In a former report the tank alluded to is thus spoken of: "another very prevalent disease here is guinea-worm. This need not be won- dered at, considering the unlimited outrages against every principle of cleanliness and sanitation that are permitted in the large tank at Uran." The temperature at Uran was at maximum in May, when at 2 P.M. the thermometer stood at 91°. The minimum was registered in De- cember, when at 6 A.M. it was 63°. 54 inches 53 cents of rain fell during the season; prevailing wind N.W. Accompanying the Me- dical Officer's report are six cases, illustrating the practice of a care- ful and intelligent officer. My predecessor suggested that the Uran dispensary only required a Hospital Assistant. In this estimate of not Uran's requirements, but those of the Island of Karinja, I do not agree, and should be very sorry to see what should always be so useful an institution placed in the hands of a Hospital Assistant, unless he were a man of superior attainments. No operations have been performed. Bandora. A town with a population of 4,282, situated at the southern point of the Island of Salsette, opposite to Mahim, in the Island of Bombay, connected with each other now by the Lady Jamsetjee causeway. There is a large railway station at Bandora, and many people employ- ed in Bombay have their residences there, as it is considered almost in the light of a sanitarium. The hill of Bandora, jutting out into the sea, is dotted with the houses of the better classes. In 1851 the inhabitants of this part of Salsette petitioned Govern- ment to be allowed to establish a dispensary for their relief, as much suffering was occasioned by the want of medical aid in times of sickness. The proprietors of land were ready to subscribe liberally100 years up to December 1864, and during this period 10,136 indigent sick were treated; the balance was Rs. 19,207 invested money, and at the end of 1866 the balance was Rs. 19,655. The house rent was up to this time (1868) at Rs. 45 per mensem; the Dispensary Committee now resolved to purchase a house, and the sum of Rs. 7,000 was paid for one, the balance was consequently reduced to Rs. 12,655. From 1868 up to present time the build- ing then purchased has continued to be occupied, and it appears to be tolerably well adapted for the purpose. The upper part is occupied by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon who has been in medical charge for a long time, the lower portion is the dispensary, where the space is by no means ample; for in-patients there is little or no accommoda- tion arranged, but for this purpose an out-building seems well situated, and on my next visit to it, the alterations necessary will be recommended to the managers, who will, if funds are forthcoming, probably arrange for them. I have noticed the progress of the funds of this dispensary, as it is the only one with which I am acquainted, under Government medi- cal superintendence, which has advanced to its present state by a sys- tem of donations and general subscriptions, in sums varying from 1 rupee to Rs. 1,000. The mass of subscribers and donors have been Parsees of Bombay and the neighbourhood101 Officer at present in charge, and I am inclined to think that, like some other dispensaries located near Bombay, a change in the medi- cal charge would probably be advantageous. During the year there were 5,977 patients treated, of which 5,929 were new admissions, and 48 remaining from the previous year; of these, 5,361 were discharged, cured or relieved, 577 absented, 7 died, and 32 remained. The daily attendance was highest in the months of September and October, when it reached 102 and 108. There were 1,425 cases of ague, giving a proportion of 24 per cent. to total treated. The temperature was highest in May and June, when the ther- mometer reached 89º, lowest in January, when it was 68º. The rainfall was guaged to 41 inches 31 cents. Six cases of dispensary practice are forwarded with the annual report. * This does not appear to be exactly the case. Out of 21 post-mortems it is stated that decomposition had too far advanced in 7 to allow of cause of death being determined. There is no dead-house at Bandora, and bodies to be examined for medico-legal purposes are taken to the seashore102 educated persons like yourself103 The temperature at Balsar was highest in the month of April and June, when the thermometer registered 93º, and lowest in January, when it was 60º. The rainfall was 39 inches 37 cents, and most rain fell in the month of June, when 12 inches were registered. At my inspection of this dispensary, I was satisfied with the care then displayed by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon in medical charge; though the number daily attending is large, there should, I think, be a much larger number treated, for the district is populous and at times malarious. In Mr.Pestonjee's work there appeared to me room for improve- ment, in the points of zeal and activity so very necessary in dispen- sary work, and so desirable if the people are to be encouraged to seek medical aid from charitable dispensaries. No major operations were performed, 126 minor of no interest; 3 post-mortem examinations were made. Randir. A large town situated on the western side of the River Taptee, about 3 miles above Surat, in the Taluka of Choorasee, has a popula- tion of about 8,725. Randir is a municipal town and appears to have much benefited, judging from former reports, by the carrying out of the rules and regulations laid down by the Commissioners. The sanitary state of the place was very satisfactory, compared with Gujrát towns in general. The present dispensary was established in the year 1862, agreeably to Government Resolution No. 1806 of that year, and under the rules of 1861, Government defraying salaries and Mr. Cowasjee Jehangier the usual expenses of maintenance (for three years). In 1865 Mr. Cowasjee offered the sum of Rs. 24,000 for the permanent maintenance of the dispensary; this was accepted in Resolution of Government, No. 1300, of 14th December 1865, but owing, I believe, to conditions required on the part of Mr. Cowasjee Jehangier not being desirable, the offer was eventually declined. I am not acquainted with the subsequent history of this dispensary to the present time, but had hoped to have obtained it for insertion here. The house originally occupied as a dispensary belonged to Mr. Cowasjee Jehangier Readymoney, C.S.I.; this was withheld when that gentleman withdrew his support104 ant Collector another site was selected in a tolerably central locality, and in a spot in other ways satisfactory, and I trust soon to hear of progress being made in the building. Much dissatisfaction had been felt with the Hospital Assistant in charge for taking somewhat too active a part in the municipal politics of the place. I thought it necessary to recommend his removal in consequence; his place is now taken by 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Bhaskur Sitaram, General No. 549, relieved from Chikli on account of ill health, who, I hope, will do well. The number of patients treated here during the year was 4,698. Of the total treated 4,581 were new admissions, and 117 remained from the previous year, 4,003 were cured or relieved, 580 absented, and 115 remained, no deaths were reported. There were no in-door patients, there being no room for their occupation. The number of ague cases was 775, giving a proportion of 16.49 to all, remittent fever gave 41 cases, simple fever and febricula.66. The temperature in May and June was as high as 99º. The rainfall is stated to have been 22 inches 76 cents. The annual report of the Hospital Assistant in charge is, for a person of his evident intelligence, meagre in the extreme, and would have been returned to him, but that he was on the eve of leaving his medical charge. 68 minor operations were performed during the year. Karwar. A rapidly increasing town and port of North Kanara, situated on the south side of the tidal River "Kalla Nuddee," a wide and deep inlet of the sea. Karwar was formerly a place of much import- ance, where the East India Company had a "factory"; "history repeats itself," and two centuries after its decay, we again see fac- tories, cotton presses, springing up the produce of the cotton trade, which will apparently converge here from the Dharwar and surround- ing districts. The gradual increase of Karwar in the year 1865 was, I presume, the cause of the establishment of a charitable dispensary under Government Resolution No. 532, of 29th March 1865. To- wards its expenses the community made a donation of Rs. 2,950 besides subscriptions of Rs. 640-8-0. The Municipality also made an annual grant of Rs. 600. The dispensary, a neat, well-built institution, was erected at a cost of Rs. 6,042, of which Rs. 2,500 were the result of private sub- scriptions, and Rs. 3,542 the donations of the Municipality and Local Funds. The pay of the Hospital Assistant is borne by the Government. There are annual subscriptions, but for three years these appear to have altogether failed; in 1871-72 Rs. 376 were subscribed; previous to this the Municipality had to bear the total cost, which in 1870-71 amounted to Rs. 1,082 for medicines, contingencies, and repairs,
105 The dispensary is fairly situated and, as the buildings continue to spring up, and the town to spread, it will hold a very central position. *Including 2 in-patients. The number of patients treated in the year was 4,230,* of which 4,185 were new admissions, and 45 remain- ed from the previous year; 3,818 were cured or relieved, 378 absented, no deaths are recorded, and 34 re- mained under treatment; 1,617 were cases of ague, giving a percent- age of 38.22 on the total treated. There were 2 in-patients included in the above. The rainfall was not more than half the usual average, 69 inches 31 cents were registered, the greatest fall of rain occurred in July, when 25 inches 88 cents were registered. The maximum temperature registered by the Hospital Assistant was 89° in the months of April and May 1871. The minimum was 66° in the month of February 1872. The Hospital Assistant 3rd Class, named Babajee Rowjee Caddum, Gl. No. 467, in medical charge of the dispensary, appears deserving, and very desirous of doing well, but is not very intelligent, and extremely backward in English. The Civil Surgeon speaks well of his character and attainments. The attainments might be much in- creased. 3 operations were performed during the year. Bhewndy. A large town situated in the taluka of that name, in the Col- lectorate of Tanna, with the old high road to Agra on the east, and the Bassein Creek on the north-west, has decreased in importance since the opening of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which passes through the neighbouring town of Kalian, and carries the greater part of the traffic, which used to pass Bhewndy on its way to Bombay viâ Salsette Bunder, on the high road above-mentioned. Bhewndy is about 10 miles distant from Tanna, and six from Kalián; it is still a place of importance, with a population of about 12,000, and is the centre of a number of small villages, for which the establishment of a dispensary must be invalu- able. The want of a dispensary here was brought to notice by Mr. Pritchard in 1866, and the proposal for its establishment, as a 2nd Class Dispensary of the A. Division, was sanctioned by Government in their Resolution No. 2384, General Department. It was opened in December of the same year, Government paying for salaries and the Municipality bearing the remaining expenditure by a grant of Rs. 864 per annum. During the year under report 4,222 persons were treated; of these 4,129 were new admissions, and 93 remained from previous year; of these 3,632 were cured or relieved, 521 absented, 2 died, and 67 remained under treatment. The number of ague cases treated in the year amounted to 728, giving a proportion of 17.24; there were, besides ague, 36 cases of
106 remittent fever and 249 of febricula. There were no in-patients, there being no room for their treatment. The meteorological register kept at Bhewndy shows that the months of greatest heat were May and June, thermometer 94° and 95º, the lowest temperature was 60° in January and February. The rainfall was 67 inches 72 cents, about half the average, an unusually small registration107 Since its formation it has been of benefit to the people. * Including 19 in-patients. The number of admissions during the official year under report was 4,323, a number much too small for this city and the crowded part about where the dispensary is situated; the total treated being 4,361,* of which 38 remained from previous year; of this number, 4,152 were cured or relieved, 152 absented, 2 died, and 55 remained. The number of in-door patients treated was 19, of whom 17 were discharged and 2 died. These are included in the above. The chief diseases treated were of the febrile and cutaneous clas- ses, of which 877 were from intermittent fever, giving a proportion of 20.27 per cent.; there were 25 cases of remittent fever. The daily average was 77.5, being 6 less than in the preceding year. There were 530 successful vaccination operations performed. The meteorological registers show that the greatest heat experien- ced was in the month of March and April, thermometer 98º, and the minimum temperature was 70º in December and January. At the annual inspection of the dispensary I was, to a certain extent, satisfied with the conduct of the duties by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Dossabhoy Pestonjee, who holds a high place in the estima- tion of the Civil Surgeon, and is a zealous member of the municipality in sanitary matters. In the annual report there is nothing stated as to the detailed character of the diseases under treatment, but the diaries of a few cases are submitted which illustrate the practice of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, none of which possess any particular interest. A former Collector of Surat has stated that Mr. Dossabhoy Pes- tonjee has a large practice in Surat. This is satisfactory as showing the estimate he is held in by those who are able to pay him, but does it not lessen the good he should be able to do in his dispensary? I think it must to a certain extent. 12 minor operations only were performed during the year. Looking at the numbers treated at the Paruk Charitable Dispen- sary, and comparing them with the largeness of the city, possessing a population of 90,000, and the amount of work carried on in far smaller towns, I confess that I am surprised at the smallness of the outturn, and must conclude that hardly sufficient time and attention are bestowed on the dispensary practice. If the public confidence is placed in the zeal and interest the Medical Attendant takes in such a dispensary, double the number might be at the very least expected to resort to it. Tanna. The chief town of the Collectorate of that name has a population of 10,581. In 1865 Mr. Rustomji Ardasir Wadia offered the sum of Rs. 25,000 to Government to be invested for maintaining a charitable dis-
108 pensary, the interest of this sum to be used for the purpose; this gentleman also gave a small house for the dispensary and residence of the Hospital Assistant, whose pay, with that of a Native Medical Pupil, was to be defrayed by Government. Since its opening this dispensary has well fulfilled its mission, and notwithstanding its proximity to the civil hospital and Govern- ment dispensary, is always well attended. In the year under report 5,408 cases were treated, of which 5,347 were fresh admissions, and 61 remained from the previous year; 4,849 were cured or relieved, 498 absented, 3 deaths were reported, and 58 remained; of the total, 1,757 cases were of intermittent fevers, giving a percentage of 32.48 to treated. There were 27 cases of remittent fever. The temperature was at its highest in June, when the thermometer stood at 95º, lowest in the month of December, when it was 60º, in which month also there was the greatest range, 27º; the rainfall guaged was 62 inches 80 cents, the greatest fall in July. The dispensary stands at the northern side of the town, and is tolerably convenient for the people. I was satisfied with the attendance and with the intelligence displayed by the Hospital Assistant, and consider him well fitted for the work he has to per- form. I am inclined to think that if the liberal founder of this dis- pensary, Mr. Ardasir Wadia, could be induced to change the present building to a larger one, the necessity for keeping up the civil dis- pensary, which is close at hand, would be obviated, the patients of which only amounted during the year to 1,519. The Hospital Assistant resides at the dispensary, but there is no accommodation for the Native Medical Pupil or for servants. I submit six cases illustrating the practice of 2nd Class Hospital Assistant, Ramjee Bapoojee, General No. 429, of whose character and attainments I entertain a favourable opinion109 The situation selected for the dispensary was a most unfortunate one; selected on such grounds as the following: 1st, that the dispensary should be near the railway station in case of accidents occurring, 2ndly, on account of its locality, where free ventilation and pure air can be had, and lastly it was considered that such a handsome build- ing as the one proposed by Mr. Munguldas Nutabhoy would be thrown away if built "in the dirty village of Kalian," whilst if erected on the site indicated "it would present a very fine appearance to the passengers by railway." Wisdom was not wanting to disapprove this very startling opinion as to a site for a charitable dispensary. The Revenue Commissioner, addressing the Collector, remarked "the desire of Mr. Munguldass Nutabhoy to build a dispensary is highly to be applauded. I wish he could be persuaded to build it in the town instead of near the rail- way station, where not one-eighth part of the good will be done, which might be effected if its establishment were in the heart of this crowded city." * Including 17 in-pa- tients. The building was commenced in 1865, finished in April 1869, and opened in May, the cost of the erection alone being Rs. 31,000; its medical history goes far to verify the opinion of the Revenue Com- missioner and the Collector; the dispensary for Kalian is evidently too far off, as was observed by me on my visit of inspection, when I found that persons desirous of advice were nearly always obliged to hire carts for conveyance to the dispensary, and consequently many would not repeat their visits. For a dispensary of such pretensions, with a Sub-Assistant Surgeon in medical charge, the total treated is small, though the number was slightly increased during the past year. In the year there were 4,254 new admissions (against 3,892 of the previous 12 months), and a total treated of 4,351,* of which 97 remained from the previous year; of this number, 2,998 were discharged, cured or relived, 1,226 absented110 Six cases of practice are forwarded with the annual report. I most emphatically endorse the opinion of my predecessor, which is as follows:111 The population is about 6,824, but including several villlages embraced in municipal limits, it amounts to 11,640. There are three or four English residents connected with banks and cotton, and a Municipality is in existence, which has largely aided in the establish- ment of this dispensary. The dispensary at Coompta was opened in 1869. On the 22nd April 1868, the Municipal Commissioners, feeling much the want of a medical institution, requested, through the Collector, the sanction and aid of Government in establishing one. To the maintenance of the dispensary, Government gave a grant-in-aid of Rs. 1,200 per annum, the Municipality defraying all expenses beyond that sum. The dispensary was opened in February 1870, and placed in the medical charge of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Vishram Ramjee Gholay, a most intelligent and most painstaking officer, under whom the dispensary, as a medical institution, has prospered, that is to say, a large amount of suffering has been relieved, and the reputation gained by Mr. Vishram has extended considerably beyond the limits of the Coompta Municipality. 112 Mr. V. R. Gholay is one of the very few Sub-Assistant Surgeons in my division who, in operative surgery, show that, under much diffi- culty, they have taken advantage of the education and practice afforded at the Grant Medical College and Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital. Major operations 29, and 295 minor were performed during the year; only two post-mortem examinations were performed for legal purposes. Elao, A small town of the Broach Collectorate, Hansot Pergunnah, situated on a branch of the Keem River, from which it is distant about one mile in a north-east direction. The population of this place was estimated at 1,975; it is probable that under the recently taken census it may have somewhat increased. This dispensary was established in November 1870, at first in a private house, as a temporary arrangement, pending the completion of a dispensary building provided by the liberality of Mr. Ardaseer Hormusjee Wadia, into which the removal took place in November 1870. The dispensary is well situated in a clear, open space somewhat outside the town at the entrance from the Keem road. There are many surrounding villages, and at certain seasons mala- ria prevails owing to the proximity to the river and its branches. My predecessor, in his last inspection, found the Hospital Assistant living in the town and the Native Medical Pupil in the dispensary. Matters were reversed at my inspection: the Hospital Assistant in- habited the upper room of the building and the Native Medical Pupil lived in the town. The dispensary is as regards plan satisfactory, but in its building it has not met with justice, the bath-rooms have mud floors and no exit for water; the doors and windows have been made of green wood which now splits and warps, and the flooring of the rooms has been most carelessly prepared. These defects were apparent. * Including 5 in-patients. The total number of cases treated in the year under report was 6,960*; of these, 6,919 were new admissions, and 41 remained from previous year; of these 6,577 were discharged, cured or relieved, 337 absented, 1 died, and 45 remained. The average daily sick was 45. There were 2,280 cases of ague, giving a proportion of 33 per cent. to total; of other fevers there were 10 cases of remittent fever. There were 5 in-door patients treated, 1 died. These are included in the above. The maximum temperature reached was 94º and minimum 76º. The minimum must be incorrect as the temperature in the cold months in Gujrát is well known to fall below this very much. Vaccination was performed on 94 children, 51 males, 43 females; of these, 87 cases were reported as successful, 7 unsuccessful, 2 un- known.
113 The operations, with the exception of reduction of four disloca- tions, have been of minor character. I was satisfied with the 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Luximon Anunth in medical charge. Six copies of cases in the practice of Elao Dispensary are for- warded. This dispensary is one of those in which the new payment system has been carried out. In March it commenced and the sum of Rs. 22 was realized, but the attendance at once fell from a daily average of 45.14 to that of 3.42. 130 minor operations have been performed. Bardoli, A town in the Surat Collectorate, in the Pergunnah of Bardoli, with a population of about 4,020. The population of the taluka is 44,534, this town is distant from Surat about 20 miles, lying in an easterly direction. The chief trade is in timber. The dispensary was opened in the year 1869, and was built entire- ly by Local Funds under the grant-in-aid system, Government pay- ing according to population Rs. 600 per annum. It is a well plan- ned, very neatly kept dispensary, infinitely better built than that at Elao. It is situated a little to the outside of the village on a clear, open space; it is, however, quite close enough for all the pur- poses of such an institution. * Including 8 in-door patients. The number of cases treated during the year amounted to 3,528*; of these, 3,472 were fresh admissions and 56 remained from previous year; of these, 3,258 were discharged, cured or relieved, 6 died, 250 absented, and 14 remained. The number of cases of ague treated were 933, or 26.44 per cent. of the whole. There were 48 cases of remittent fever, 8 in-patients were treated, 2 died. These are included in the above. The temperature recorded cannot be trusted, and the rainfall is not given. Six cases are forwarded, only two of which are written by the pre- sent Hospital Assistant in charge; both these cases appear never to have returned for further treatment! 95 minor operations were performed. The Hospital Assistant at present in charge, Gopall Hurree, Gene- ral No. 869, appears to me to be a well-behaved man, but he had not then gained the confidence of the people. I saw few patients while I remained at Bardoli. Gopall Huree's acquaintance with English is of the slightest description, his medical attainments are tolerable, his books, as far as they went, were tolerably kept, but not quite correctly; he is not much assisted by his Native Medical Pupil, Damoder Madeo, General No. 823, who is backward. After a longer residence I shall be able to judge better as to the advisability of the Hospital Assistant being kept at this place.
114 In this dispensary the new payment system was brought into ac- tion in March. In this month the sum of Rs. 22 was realized, but the falling off in attendance was very great and much to be deplored; in February there was an average attendance of 23.9 in March 5.4. Mandvi, A town in the Collectorate of Surat and Pergunnah of the same name, pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Taptee where that river is, however, not navigable for other than small boats; this town lies 19 miles south-east of Surat. The country around is reported to be highly malarious, the water bad, and the hilly jungle considerable. In 1868 the community of Mandvi expressed their desire for the establishment of a dispensary, and voted a subscription of Rs. 1,255 towards it. The matter was taken into consideration, and under Re- solution No. 1257, dated 26th May 1869, the establishment of a dis- pensary was sanctioned under the grant-in-aid system, Government paying Rs. 600 per annum, according to population. The dispensary was opened on the 2nd August 1869 in a native house and removed to the dispensary building, erected at the cost of the Local Funds in 1870. The situation of the dispensary is tolerably central, it is close to the Cutcherry, to the Police lines, and to the residence of the family of the late Chief: in fact it occupies one corner of the old "Rajawaree," one side abutting directly on the main road. The building is much the same as that at Bardoli, but being confined in its surroundings does not present so pleasing an appearance. My visit of inspection did not impress me satisfactorily as to the necessary care and atten- tion bestowed by the Hospital Assistant in medical charge, Govind Keshow, General No. 520. I did not see many patients, but the average daily attendance at the dispensary is stated in the returns to be 44.38. No operations, either major or minor, are recorded. The number of sick admitted during the year under report was 4,029 there had remained 36 from previous year, total treated 4,065, including 7 in-patients; of these, 3,325 were cured or relieved, 1 died, 721 absented, 18 remained. The number of fever cases (ague) was 813, being 20 per cent. to the whole treated. There were 3 cases of febricula; no cases of remittent fever. This is curious; the surrounding country is con- fessedly most malarious, and I should have expected a far greater number of applicants for relief under this head. Seven in-patients were treated, 1 died, these are included in the above. Six cases are forwarded. I have since been informed that this Hospital Assistant has really neglected and carelessly conducted the vaccination of Mandvi.115 This dispensary was brought under the payment system in March. Result.116 to that of my predecessor as to his professional qualifications, I trust the resignation will be accepted. In a central position of the town there is a property belonging to Government which, with the expenditure of from 1 to Rs. 2,000, could be made into a very fair dispensary for this place, and I am of opinion that this should be done as soon as possible, by the aid of Government and Local Funds. The inhabitants are said to be poor, and when I was at Anklesar on tour, I sent to the chief persons to meet me, only one person came ! I have to write on the subject. The Annual Report of Mr. Heerjee Ardaseer is as good as that of many Hospital Assistants, but the treatment of disease he has not touched upon. The rainfall was 16 inches 56 cents. The payment system was commenced in March in the present year, with the following results: Rs. 29-14-9 were received. In February the average number of daily sick was 40, in March 14, in April 7. No report of operations, either major or minor, is shown, and no legal post-mortem examinations were performed. Hansot, A town in the Broach Collectorate, with a population of 4,152, in the taluka of the same name, situated near the south- eastern bank of the broad Estuary of the Nerbudda, and 14 miles south-west of Broach. The Nerbudda is about two or three miles distant in direct northerly direction. There is no municipality, and Hansot has the same neglected appearance as many of these Gujrat towns and villages present, as if houses were crumbling to pieces, and as they crumble away the debris left, with other col- lections to make up a general result of a most uninviting description. The Hospital Assistant says " the town presents a very dirty ap- pearance; the supply of drinking-water is from wells which are shaded by Peepul and Mangoe trees, the water sends forth offensive smells, the waste water runs through the streets and yields noxious gases, spoiling the surrounding atmosphere." The dispensary was opened in May 1870, under Resolution of Gov- ernment No. 1257, 26th May 1869, Government giving Rs. 600 per annum. A Hospital Assistant, educated in the Grant Medical College, has the medical charge. The dispensary occupies two rooms in a private house in the centre of the town; these are so ill-suited for the purpose that I presume the arrangement to be only a provisional one. It is unnecessary to enter into a description, as if a building is not provided it would be advisable to change to some other house. At my inspection I went
117 over the whole town, but though I examined several places, none could then be found at all suitable or convenient. The total treated in the year under report was 5,099; of these, 5,708 were fresh admissions and 21 remained from previous year; 4,861 were cured or relieved, 219 absented, and 19 remained under treat- ment; no deaths recorded. Of the treated 1,126 were from ague, being 22.27 per cent.; there were 127 cases of remittent fever. No in-pa- tients were treated, there being no place for their reception. From the position of the Nerbudda and the country around, I should have looked for more evidence of fever than the dispensary cases afford. The vaccination report shows that 60 cases were operated on suc- cessfully. No thermometrical observations were made; the rainfall is not remarked on in the annual report of 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Abbajee Babajee, General No. 556. As far as I could observe this Assistant performed his medical duties satisfactorily. The payment system was commenced at this dispensary with the Following results:118 * Including 4 In-door pa- tients. and not very zealous. The dispensary was however very clean, the compound was under ornamental cultivation by him. The number of cases remaining from last year was 172, there were admitted in the year under report 5,367, making a total treated of 5,539;* of these, 3,593 were cured or relieved, 1,865 absented119 sented, no deaths reported, 16 remained. No in-door-patients, there being no place for their reception; average number of patients 17.6. Out of the number treated 1,079 were fever cases, ague, being 31.23 per cent. of the whole. There were 36 cases of remittent fever. At my inspection the 3rd Class Hospital Assistant in medical charge, Bhasker Sittaram, General No. 549, stated that he had suffer- ed from repeated attacks of fever. His appearance bore out his state- ment, his removal appeared to me to be very necessary, and as the 3rd Class Hospital Assistant at Randir had to be removed, this man was recommended to fill his place, and 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Chintamon Bullal was put, as a temporary measure, in charge. I cannot speak as to the acquirements of this man (C. B.), but of Bhas- ker Sittaram I may say that he appeared to me to be intelligent, but if the carelessness exhibited in book-keeping was attributable to anything else than weakness from disease, I should say he should be remanded to general duty. His work at Randir is pronounced by the Civil Surgeon as fair. Many of these 3rd Class Hospital Assistants, fresh from the vernacular class, sent to new dispensaries without any knowledge of what is required, cannot help making mistakes and continuing in error until inspected. I would recom- mend, whenever the service requirements do not call for immediate employment, that these men should be sent to the office of a Deputy Inspector General to learn the clerical work of dispensaries in the examination of reports, &c. The annual report is meagre in the extreme, prepared by 3rd Class Hospital Assistant Chintamon Bullal, it is unsatisfactory. He, states he is unable to give the daily average number of sick in consequence of the faulty mode of keeping the register. Last year the daily average number of patients was 5.2, the year under report 17.6. Four legal post-mortem examinations were per- formed during the year. No thermometrical register is reported on. No rainfall. No opera- tions were performed. No receipt for payments received. Pen, A town in the Alibag Collectorate, situated on the River Boy- wattee or Creek, about 23 miles south-east from its entrance, on the south-east of the Bombay harbour, possesses a population of about 6,000, chiefly Hindoos, and a municipality: the dispensary was established under Government Resolution No. 1287, of 17th May 1871, and was opened in the same year. The dispensary is situated in the upper floors of a private house in the main street, rented for the purpose from a member of the municipality at Rs. 7 per month. The first floor is divided into one large room and three small adjuncts. One of these, extremely limi- ted, is set apart for in-patients, another is used for stores and for private examination, and the 3rd is a sort of attendance room.
120 There is a loft or second floor above used for the preparation of decoctions and infusions, it is unfit for anything else. The whole is extremely ill-adapted, and its selection ill-advised for the purpose of a dispensary. The dispensary floor is reached by a narrow, steep, difficult ladder, which no very sick person could ascend. I would strongly advise arrangements being made for renting the whole of this house for the dispensary; the lower floor is now occu- pied as the store room of a merchant named Keshew Set. The owner, a principal member of the municipality, would, I believe, alter it to suit the requirements, and let the whole for about Rs. 15 per month. Unless early measures are in contemplation for the erection of a new dispensary building, I strongly advise this being done, as the better accommodation which would be thus provided, and ease of access to the place would much increase the number of applicants. The daily average attendance since its opening is 42. The Hospital Assistant, General No. 418, Hurree Row Powar, is intellegent and active, but sickly. At the time of my visit to the dispensary I saw the Mamlutdar and Keshew Set, no other members of the Dispensary Committee presented themselves. Vaccination was carried on with diffi- culty. I inspected the whole of the town and observed it to be in far from a cleanly condition. It would be beneficial for the muni- cipality to have, as one of its members, a person sufficiently acquaint- ed with common sanitary requirements to advise them. At Pen the Hospital Assistant might fill this position with advantage. The appearance of this town of 6,000 inhabitants impressed me with the idea that if money is expended on its cleanliness it must be wasted, for its streets and byeways were dirty and an air of laisser faire pervaded the whole. * Including 2 in-door patients. The number of treated during the year under report amounted to 6,026*; of these, 61 remained from the pre- vious year, and 5,965 were fresh admissions, 4,964 were cured or relieved, 1,022 absented, 7 died, and 33 remained. Ague gave 1,300 cases, a ratio of 21.5 per cent. on the whole treated. Of other fevers there were four cases. There were two in-patients. The temperature registered was 92º highest in the month of May and 78º lowest in the month of January. 2nd Class Hospital Assistant Hurree Row Powar is an extremely intelligent and active man; his health has latterly failed him, and he has recently been reported to me as suffering under a disease of which albuminaria is a symptom; in consequence his returns and reports have fallen into arrears, and I have been obliged to make up the annual return of sickness from the monthly documents. The result of the payment system commenced in March was as follows:121 No legal post-mortem examinations were conducted during the year. 59 minor operations were performed. The Dispensaries of the 3rd Class are122 Maconachie, the Acting Opthalmic Surgeon, joined on the above date, and appears to me to be succeeding well. H. M.'s Dockyard Dispensary. The dispensary for the attendance on the sick employés of the Dockyard is a small, ill-built, ill-situated place, in which, according to the Surgeon in charge, the "delicate operations of auscultation" can with great difficulty be carried on, owing to the many noises incidental to mechanical work which is performed too close to the dispensary. The number of men employed in the Dockyard has been decreased this year by 287. The number treated in the year under report was 3,848, of whom 46r emained from last return, and 3,802 were fresh admissions; of these, 3,779 were discharged, cured or relieved, 9 died, 22 absented, and 38 remained under treatment. There were 638 cases of intermittent fever, giving a ratio of 16.34 per cent. to treated. Dengue fever gave 174 cases, and febricula 209 cases. The following I extract from Surgeon Roger's report: "As might be expected from the climate and the work in which the men are engaged, rheumatic affections figure largely in the return, no fewer than 216 cases having been treated during the year. The disorders of the nervous system, too, indicate the severity and trying nature of the labour the men perform, 165 cases of sickness, exhibiting more or less derangement of the nervous centres, have been treated, and out of that large number one from idiopathic tetanus and one from paralysis proved fatal. "Injuries of greater or less extent must naturally be looked for in an extensive establishment, where large and heavy machinery is al- most constantly in operation, and we have 458 cases given under the heads of general injuries, but it is satisfactory to be able to record that only one casualty occurred from personal injuries received, the majority of which appear under the head of contusions. "One case proved fatal in the person of a boiler-maker who was treated by a general practitioner, the nature of the disease from which he suffered I am not aware of. With reference to the casualty just noticed, I have every reason to believe that the man's illness was en- tirely caused by the unnecessary and terribly severe physical strain which he underwent working hard in a ship's hold for 12 consecutive hours without proper rest Another man, a boiler-maker, who was permitted to act in the same suicidal manner, was dangerously ill for some weeks, and very nearly added to the list of casualties. "The men, I am clearly of opinion, should have regular hours for work, and unless very pressing exigencies call for it, should not be obliged, or even permitted to work for longer than 8 hours, with rest for one hour, during that time, when food and other refreshment might be indulged in, except in the hot season, when time for rest should be extended to two hours, the working hours being from 8 till 11.30 and from 1.30 to 5."
123 These statements and suggestions founded on them, appear deserv- ing of further notice, particularly that where death is shown to be "entirely caused by unnecessary and terribly severe physical strain." During the year 6 men and officers have been sent to England, and 8 have been invalided. There is no place for in-patients. The Apothecary was appointed to attend the dispensary and, as far as I can learn, be present during the working hours. His work has been since extended to attendance at the dwellings of many of the European employés, and in conse- quence the earlier rules of the appointment have been departed from, as to enable him to do this and meet their wishes, he has to absent himself from the Dockyard. His hours of attendance were from 10 till 4124 Of the treated 1,227 were from ague, giving a ratio of 23.27 to treated. Intestinal worms and rheumatism were prevalent com- plaints; cholera appeared in several parts of the district of Alibag, to which the Sub-Assistant Surgeon in medical charge proceeded; his account is very clear, and traces the source of the disease. 57 per cent. 66 per cent. It occurred twice at a place called Roha-Ushtumee, situated on a tidal creek. At the first visit, in March 1871, its source was traced to Junjeera, the chief town and fortress of the " Hubshee," from which place a person with cholera had arrived. This attack was short, and only a few died125 ment; 713 cases were of ague, giving a ratio of 46.67 per cent. to the whole, being even a greater ratio than shown in the returns of the charitable dispensary in the same town and for Coorla and Bandora. The Civil Surgeon in charge considers that the year under report has been very productive of hepatic ailments, 15 cases having occur- red in the dispensary practice; but hepatic ailments, Surgeon At- kins observes, have equally presented themselves in all the charges under him to a greater extent than he has ever known before. I quote passages from the Civil Surgeon's return:126 treatment, with eyes completely destroyed: it occurs chiefly in children and the young Bunia females. Of remittent fever 31 cases were treated. Rheumatism gave many cases, 413. There is nothing remarkable in the treatment of dispensary disease by the Civil Surgeon. Comparing the number treated with that of the charitable dispensary (Paruk) it appears that a larger number, by 3,582, have been treated at the Government dispensary, and the average daily number of sick is also greater by 2.5. No surgical operations of more than minor interest were perform- ed127 is made for the medicine. The attendance is good, and many of those who would otherwise attend the Government dispensary now attend there." This remark is curious; it must mean either people prefer to pay, or they have more confidence in the treatment pro- vided by the Parsee! During the year 28 minor operations have been performed. Ratnagiri. The dispensary here is attached to the civil hospital, and under the present Civil Surgeon has had a much larger number of attendants than usual. During the year under report 3,476 cases were treated; of these 35 remained from previous year, 3,441 were fresh admissions, 2,367 were cured or relieved, 1,095 absented, 2 died, 12 remained. In the preceding 12 months 2,614 applied for treat- ment, in 1868 they amounted to only 1,113. A considerable part of the increase was in the female attendance; this is very important to notice. The daily average has also arisen from 6.7 to 15. 148 cases were of ague, giving a ratio of percentage of 4.29. This is extremely small and difficult to give a reason for, unless it is that the dispensary is not visited by persons living at any distance from the place. The situation of the civil hospital is not a good one for the dispensary, which would be of much more benefit were it located in the town below. Between Ratnagiri and Dapuli, a distance of 55 miles to the north, and to Vengurla to the south, a distance of 70 [?] miles, there is no medical aid available. The operations were all minor, 149 in number. The earliest record of this dispensary in possession is for May 1849, in which month the admissions were 23. Surgeon C. Joynt, M.D., deserves credit for bringing up the dis- pensary practice. I hope to see it still improve; the good these in- stitutions are able to afford depends so much on the zeal and activity of medical officers that, where these are evident, the favourable notice of the Inspector General should be shown. Dapuli. Originally the position of a military brigade, subsequently, the brigade being done away with, the station was used for the Native Veteran Battalion which sent detachments to the various treasuries in the Tanna and Ratnagiri districts; this battalion being broken up, Dapuli was converted into a civil station for the Mamlutdar's and Moonsiff's Courts, which were removed from Hurnee. The town has gone considerably off since its abandonment as a military post. The invalid officers and their families have died or departed, and the European element is now confined to three or four families, in- cluding the Honorary Assistant Surgeon in medical charge.
128 Dapuli, 600 feet above the level of the sea, is nine miles inland from Hurnee on the coast, where a company of European veterans was located formerly. There is no harbour, and the place is shut out from approach dur- ing the monsoon. Hurnee is a fishing village in proximity to the old Mahrattee forts of "Sooverndroog," which shelter the road-stead a little from north-west winds. From Hurnee, after passing along the sands for about 1 mile southwards, a good road winds up the Ghaut to Dapuli. In this district many native pensioners reside, and during the year 1857-58 some companies, composed of pensioners, were formed, dressed, and equiped for active duty in the Koncan. The dispensary here is very small, but affords space for three or four in-patients from the Police detachments in the district, or occa- sionally from the people. This dispensary gives the nearest medical aid from Alibag on the north, 60 miles, and Ratnagiri in the south, 55 miles. Including 59 in-door pa- tients. The total number of cases treated at the dispensary in the year was 1,784,* of which 24 were remaining on last return, and 1,760 were fresh admissions; of this number 1,614 were cured or relieved, 140 absented, 3 died, and 27 remained. The increase is 293 cases over previous year, 367 cases of ague were treated, giving a ratio per cent. of 20.56; of other fevers there were 152 of febricula, and 2 of remittent fever. There were 59 in-door patients treated, these are included in the above statement: 3 died, 2 from remitent fever and one from diar- rh129 Vengurla, which is sheltered from all winds except the south. The town is distant from the landing place, built for landing cargo and for shipping, about ¾ths of a mile; there is a small customs bungalow on a peak of rock close to the landing. Vengurla is distant from Bombay 250 miles south, and the British sanitarium of Rairee is 6 miles off. A Native Regiment, or a Wing, was formerly quartered at the station, which is about 1½ or 2 miles from the town, and the hospital of the abandoned camp, where there are a few bungalows still standing, is the dispensary and the so-called civil hospital of Vengurla; it receives a few in-patients from the large detachment of Police quartered at the camp and in Vengurla, mendicants and passing sepoys often sick, sometimes having overstayed leave, requiring certificates. As a dispensary its utility is not much more apparent. The town itself being so distant and the groups of villages, all more or less mixed up in business with the town, it could not be expected that many sick would attend, and the result is as might be anticipa- ted. 696 cases only were treated, the daily average attendance was 19, being nearly twice as many as in the previous year, 677 were fresh admissions, and 19 remained from the last return; 676 of these were cured or relived, 1 absented, 4 died, and 15 remained. 147 were cases of intermittent fever, giving a ratio of 20.9 per cent. to the whole. The in-patients were 78, with one death. These are included in the return for dispensaries, and in the above state- ment. Vaccination was carefully attended to, but was not very successful for so large a place as this; as in the whole matter of civil hospital and dispensary, the distance renders the performance of duties difficult. There is no doubt a dispensary, with accommodation for a few in- patients, would be of the greatest material benefit in the town of Vengurla130 There are several Government buildings in progress in Vengurla, a Post Office, School, and Telegraph Office.. Separate inspection reports are submitted for civil dispensary and police by Apothecary Underwood, but in the annual return made out by me, the two former are included under dispensary, except 6 Euro pean patients. Maximum temperature registered was in April 93°, minimum in January, 69°. The fall of rain guaged was 76 inches 69 cents, the greater fall was in July, when 30 inches 68 cents fell. This dispensary is entirely supported by Government No operations were performed or recorded; two post-mortems, legal, were conducted during the year. Karwar. At the civil hospital, Karwar, out-patients are attended to by the civil surgeon daily, very few attend the place; it is out of the way, difficult of access, and there are no arrangements for waiting-room, &c., indeed there are no arrangements of any kind suitable. The total treated during the year was however 1,334, of which 20 remained from the previous year, and 1,314 were fresh admissions, being 104 increase over previous year; 1,312 were cured or re lieved, 8 absented, none died, and 14 remained under treatment. There were 523 cases of ague, 99 in excess of previous year, giv- ing a ratio of 40 per cent. The expenses of this dispensary are merged into those of the civil hospital, which is here quite distinct from that for the Police. Surgeon J. Davies is in medical charge. Three operations were performed, all minor. Honore. The remains of a large town and military station in North Kanara, the chief town of the taluka of the same name. It is situated on the bank of an extensive inlet of the sea forming a large expanse of sea lake, dotted with small islands covered with trees, and forming a most lovely scene when viewed from the elevated rocks on shore. At its southern extremity the " Gairsoppa " river empties itself. Honore is 340 miles south-east from Bombay, and is the southern limit of the Presidency medical circle of superintendence. It has a population of about 2,000, but no municipality. Deserted as it is, there are still a few bungalows standing; the dispensary occupies the old court-house of the Sudder Ameen. Its expenses are entirely paid for by Government. There is ample room in the dispensary for the reception of in-putients, of which a few only take advantage.
131 The number of patients treated in the dispensary during the year under report was 4,066, of whom 34 remained from last return, and 4,032 were fresh admissions; of these 4,043 were cured or relieved, 1 absented, 5 died,and 17 remained under treatment. 1,106 were cases of fever (ague), yielding a ratio of 27. 23 per cent, There is much less fever towards the sea than more inland and above the Ghants. The in-patients were 4, and one death, these are included in the above. No register of temperature or rainfall has been kept. Dissatisfaction had been felt with the Hospital Assistant stationed here, and at my visit I was led to consider that Gungadhur Venayek was not well fitted for the post of a medical charge, and I conse quently recommended his removal, which was sanctioned. A 3rd Class Hospital Assistant, Withul Biccajee, General No. 866, educated in the Vernacular Class, Grant Medical College, was placed in his stead. I cannot say that the work of this Assistant is quite satis factory, but I would suspend judgment pending the Civil Surgeon's next visit and my own inspection. The annual report is ill pre pared, not written by himself, and shows that a minimum of care has been used in making it up. Vaccination is not alluded to in the report, but I found that it had been attented to, but not to any extent. Seven post-mortem exami- nations were made during the year. Only one minor operation was performed. Sawantwari132 The Superintendent's pay is debited wholly to Government. The daily average number of patients for the last 5 years has been 5.2. The population at the last census was 1,056. Water is obtained at the commencement of the season from springs, but the supply is procured from storage grounds: it is barely sufficient for the season. The number of cases treated here was 139, of which 3 remained from last report; of these 135 were cured or relieved, none died, absented none, and 4 remained. The present Superintendent considers that there is a local malaria, which atmospheric changes, insufficient food, and shelter render the lower classes more prone to receive, Vaccination has been performed by the Native Vaccinator from Karjat, who periodically visits the hill, No capital operations have been performed, there were 6 minor. At my annual visit of inspection I found the dispensary in good order, the supply of medicines sufficient. Instruments few, in toler able order. Dr. Simpson's report gives in review no particular points to notice, Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Dispensaries. Attached to the Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy Hospital are two dispen- saries, one for male, and one for female patients. The Dispensary for Male Patients. This dispensary under the charge of the 3rd Physician, J. J. Hos pital, had 19,284 persons treated in the year under report; of these 612 remained from the previous year's return, and 18,672 were fresh admissions, 12,923 were cured or relieved, 5,804 absented, none died, and 577 remained. The average daily attendance was 161.8, The prevailing diseases were fevers, bowel and chest complaints, skin affections, rheumatism, venereal diseases, &c. The number of admissions show a considerable increase during the year. J. J. Hospital Female and Children's. Dispensary. The female and children's dispensary had a less number of ad missions during the year under report, there were 14,844 treated, of which 1,554 were remained from previous year, 13,290 were fresh admissions; 11,342 discharged, cured or relieved, 3,189 absented, none died, and 313 remained. The average daily number of sick was greater than in the previous year, showing, I presume, that longer treatment was required, or daily attendance was more regular of the cases, as the admissions during the year were less. Dr. Ward, who is in charge of this dispensary, does not consider any of the diseases call for special remark. They were chiefly cases of fevers, disease of stomach and bowels, diseases of the heart and lungs, and skin diseases. At my visits to these dispensaries, I was satisfied with the manner in which the duties were conducted. At the male dispensary there are alterations urgently required, which I have remarked on under the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital.
133 The dispensary for females and children, which is held in close proximity to the obstetric Wards, is susceptible of much improve- ment.

134 In each of the hospitals and dispensaries in this report, I have made it a point to allude to the amount of "ague" shown in the Returns . It is almost unnecessary to speak of its great prevalence in the districts, particularly great in those of the Tanna, Surat, and Broach Zillahs in the north, and Karwar in the south, where tidal creeks abound, and produce the poison which gives life to ague, and misery to a large mass of the people. Taking dispensary practice as an exponent of the amount of this fever in the various districts lying below the Ghauts, it is evident that it must prevail to a far greater extent than it is possible for present hospitals or dispensaries to assist in the alleviation of. My visit to the dispensaries in the year led me to consider that the only way to remedy the evil, to reach the classes amongst whom "fever" and "disease of the stomach and bowels" most prevail, is to establish small unpretending dispensaries in small towns, or in groups of small villages or "Wadees." These diseases constitute two-thirds of those Which people suffer from, who now present themselves at the dispensaries of districts. If small dispensaries, therefore, with a few useful medicines were available, persons labouring under such diseases would quickly seek the relief, which, distance, occupation, &c., prevent them from applying for when the required journey is some miles away. BOMBAY MARINE. As a part of the Medical charge of the Presidency Division, the Bombay Marine has not, as far as I am aware, been ever regularly brought into report form. Since the abolition of the Indian Navy the reports and returns have been desultory, and the endeavour is now being made to bring them into regularity. The charges, under the Presidency Medical Circle, consist of cer- tain vessels of the Bombay Marine, the small naval station at Bassa- dore, and of the dispensary of the Dockyard, Bombay. Strength.

135 The superintendence of the duties of the Marine Surgeon may be added. Returns are received from the first six only. The sick oc- curring in any other vessels I have not received any statements con- cerning, nor do I know anything of them with the exception of the two Turret Ships. Of the vessels of the Bombay Marine mentioned above136 quainted, nor do I receive reports of any kind from him; but the re- ports of the "Comet," as before stated, are received from Hospital Assistant P. C. Pais. There are also those of Assistant Apothecary J. Lawrence, General No. 111, attached to the "Amberwitch," and Assistant Apothecary T. Stephen, General No. 117, to the "Con- stance": from these also no returns are received. Indents for medicines are received by me from the Uncovenanted Medical. Officer in medical charge of Muscat, but no returns: and medicine indents are also received from Teheran, Ispahan, &c. Con- siderable quantities of medicines are annually indented for by the Officer in medical charge at Muscat. I believe the medical returns of certain vessels are submitted to the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, Sind Division. The health of the officers and men of the Bombay Marine, as far as I am able to collect from the returns, has been. tolerably favour- able during the year. In my next report I trust to be able to give a clearer account than I am now able to do, of this part of the medical history of the Presi- dency Division and Bombay Marine. As may be inferred from the above, the medical. histories of the various vessels of the Bombay Marine do not present any very im- portant features, except that of Her Majesty's Steamer "Dalhousie," in which the dengue fever appeared in December 1871, ran through the whole crew and, at first unrecognized, infected a party of Euro- pean troops which she carried in that month to Cannanore, Iron which place a report was sent by the Garrison. surgeon. to the Medical Authorities at Madras, and from them to Bombay, stating the cir- cumstances of the existence of the "Dengue," its lowing affected the soldiers, their wives, &c., &c., and also giving a statement as to the source of the disease which, had it been correct, would have evi- denced great want of care in the authorities in Bombay. The state- ment made by the Garrison Surgeon at Cannanore is to the follow- ing effect: " The Dalhousie was some time ago at Aden, and on her return, voyage to Bombay the fever broke out amongst the crew, for the most part Lascars. At Bombay the vessel was cleaned and painted, but disinfectants were not used as the authorities at Bombay did not think the fever contagious." This statement was taken up and appeared in the Calcutta Medical Gazette, the Madras Quarterly, in the daily papers of all the Presi- dencies, and in the Lancet. To show its utter incorrectness I now submit, first, the return of sickness on board the "Dalhousie" for the month of April 1871, the month of her being last at Aden, and her return voyage from it, and secondly the history of the ship from March 11th, long before the dengue was known at Aden, until the 15th December 1871, when it first attacked the crew, when the disease, being mild in character, was not recognised in time to prevent the ship being used as a trans- port for the Europeans proceeding to Cannanore. The "Dalhousie,"
137 it will be observed in the history, was painted long before the crew was attacked. The history of Her Majesty's Steamer "Dalhousie," Bombay Marine, from 11th March 1871 to the 15th December 1871, shows that she left Bombay with European troops for Beypore and returned to port on the 18th; on the 23rd she left with a Company of Sappers and Miners for Aden, where she arrived on the 1st April; on the 3rd of this month she left this port to provision Her Majesty's Gun-boat "Lynx" blockading the East Coast of Africa. The "Dalhousie" returned to Aden on the 8th of the same month; on the 10th April she proceeded to Perim with the Political Resident, and returned on the 12th idem, and on the 14th left for Bombay with European Details. She arrived in Bombay on the 23rd April, all well. During the few days at anchor at Aden the men, I understand, had little or no communication with the shore as regards being allowed leave, and I cannot ascertain that they shipped any Lascars at that port.

She on that day returned to her moorings in the harbour. Or the 28th May she proceeded to sea in search of a wreck; called at Carwar for a few hours, and returned to Bombay, where she arrived on the 1st June 1871. On the 8th June 1871 the "Dalhousie" was docked and in Dock she remained until the 12th December 1871, when she was hauled out and the crew shipped. On the 15th December there were three cases of fever, which after occurrences would point out to have been dengue, but at the time the symptoms were obscure and unnoticed. Up to this period the few officers and crew who had not been paid off always enjoyed good health. The history of the vessel therefore clears her entirely from the imputation of having brought the disease to Bombay from Aden, the fever was imported on board from Bombay itself evidently, and the further history of the ship shows that the three cases abovementioned were the "fons et origo mali," for on the 24th December it was re- ported that a large number of the crew were suffering from fever, and as the "Dalhousie" had to convey European troops to Cannanore it was thought advisable that the Marine Surgeon should visit and report on the subject. This was done: the Marine Surgeon did not recognize anything peculiar in the fever, under which the men were suffering, 30 in number; he considered the fever mild in type and was unable to discover on board any cause for it. The Assistant Apothecary in Medical Charge, who was himself attacked, could give no clue to the origin of the disease nor did his own symptoms lead him to suppose that there was anything peculiar (until some time afterwards, on return voyage from Cannanore, when the disease con- tinuing, he considered it arose from the painting which the ship had undergone in dock and which had not well dried !) The Marine Surgeon was asked by the Deputy Inspector General whether he considered the disease shewed signs of the dengue, he did not think it did. The troops under orders for Cannanore were therefore allowed to embark, they did so on the 29th December and left Bombay on the 1st January. My duties called me from Bombay on the same day and I did not return till the 18th; during this time fresh circum- stances had arisen concerning the " Dalhousie." On the 9th January the Assistant Apothecary in charge reported his return to Bombay with the steamer, and stated that there were on his list 5 Europeans, 2 Natives sick, 16 Europeans and 94 Natives convalescent, having pains in the joints and extremities: all these were returned as cases of lead poisoning by the Assistant Apothe- cary, who up to this time did not know that the disease was "dengue." The officers and crew could not perform their duties fully.
139 There was no case of sickness, one or two of the officers and men were stiff from the effects of the fever, but all were more or less at work. Further directions for disinfection were given. The circumstances were favorable. No sickness was on board. No case had occurred since the 15th, and none of the men shipped be- tween the 12th and 18th had been attacked, therefore the Quarter Master General was informed that "the present favourable circum- stances continuing, the 24th of January might be directed as the day of embarkation for the Native Troops proceeding to Aden." On this day a fresh admission was reported, and the embarkation was postponed sine die. Subsequently it was found necessary to send the steamer on the 29th to Butcher's Island, as more men be- came affected, to remove the officers and crew to the Island, and to empty the steamer of her stores and cargo: she was then most tho- roughly and completely disinfected, the cushions and linings removed and burnt, and the vessel for a fortnight or more left free. The men on the Island were, with one or two exceptions of the disease, all well: they were regularly bathed, their clothing exposed daily to the sun, boiled and disinfected according to its character, and blankets, pillows, upholstery, which it was found impossible to arrange to for, and in which no doubt the infective power remained, were burnt. The steamer was again docked on the 24th February, undocked on the 28th, and as since the 6th February no fresh cases of the disease had appeared, she was again reported fit for employment, and employed early in March: since then there have been no fresh cases on board. It is necessary to state that the earliest knowledge of "dengue" at Aden, was in the last fortnight of June 1871, and even then it was not clearly recognized. The Marine Surgeon was again directed to proceed on board, and report to the Quarter Master General whether the vessel was, in his opinion, in a fit state to receive on boad Native Troops for Aden on the 12th. This officer now recognized the disease affecting the crew as "dengue" and considered that troops should not be embark- ed until disinfecting precautions had been taken. The precautions recommended by the Marine Surgeon were not carried out in their entirety. On the 18th I returned to Bombay, and on the 19th inspected the ship. She had been thoroughly vetilated, fumigated, and half of the crew allowed each night to go on shore; the crew had not been changed as recommended.
140 The cases of the dengue on board the Dalhousie presented no peculiar features distinct from the now well-known characters of the disease. The Assistant Apothecary has given a very fair description of it. It would not have received such prominent attention here, only that the mis-statement of the Garrison Surgeon, Cananore, called for correction: this correction it would, perhaps, be advisable to have published. T. B. JOHNSTONE, M.D., Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, P.D. and Bombay Marine. Bombay, 15th April 1872.
ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, DISPENSARIES, &c., IN THE POONA DIVISION FOR THE YEAR 1871-72. The Poona Circle of medical administration is a very extensive one. It includes nine collectorates, to the principal or sudder station of which a civil hospital is attached, consequently the present reports will embrace the operations of nine civil surgeons. These nine civil hospitals, with their civil dispensaries, and 26 charitable dispensaries, dispersed over a vast area of country, have been established for the purpose of affording. medical aid and relief to about 7,000,000 of the civil population. During my tour of inspection, which commenced in the begining of December and terminated at the end of March last, I visited every civil station in this division, and am happy in being able again to record my entire satisfaction with the manner in which the several medical officers in charge of these establishments have con- ducted their duties; as the state of each hospital has already been commented on in my annual inspection reports, I shall not further allude to the subject here. Before commencing my report on the sickness and mortality which has occurred in the hospitals and dispensaries during the past year, I propose making a few brief remarks on the meteorological and sanitary condition of the Deccan and Southern Maratha Circle gene- rally, as drawn from the various observations submitted. The monsoon of 1871 must be considered an exceptional one. The rainfall was not only one of the scantiest on record, but it came at irregular and unseasonable periods. This circumstance, no doubt, accounts in a great measure for the high mean temperature experienced throughout the year, and the sickness which has very generally prevailed. Ozone.142 the mortality in the hospitals was greatest, with a decrease in the general sickness, and that the reverse obtained in those months in which ozone was present. Sickness and Mortality.143 Dysentery.144 The boy was 12 years of age, and in an attempt to rob him of a few ornaments worn about his person, he sustained the following in- juries:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74977973.tif]
145 Death from Chloroform.146 to the fact of the convicts having been confined in tents, during all seasons of the year for two years, and to the neglect of sanitary arrangements. Fevers of a paroxysmal character contribute by far the largest share to the total of admission to jail hospitals. Next in numerical order are skin diseases; these two classes of disease form more than one-half of the total number treated From the former there were 1,102 admissions and 4 deaths. The latter gives 571 and deaths 4. Rheumatic affections, syphilitic or otherwise, were by no means uncommon, and returns show from these causes 110 admissions and 1 death. Diseases of the stomach and bowels have not been prevalent during the year. The total treated is 277, with 9 deaths. From diarrh147 Since the year 1869, but taking out 1868, which was an unusually sickly one, though with a small mortality, the treated to strength varied from 109 to 90, and the mortality from 1.5 to 0.7. In 1870 there was no death. The report submitted from Dhulia Jail is worthy of a careful perusal. It has evidently been drawn up with care and reflection, and credit is due to Dr. Bainbridge for the same. The report from Yerowda Jail is likewise to be commended. Dr. Wiehe is an officer who has had great experience in the management and superintendence of jails, and his remarks, whether affecting discipline or medical treatment, all bear the stamp of practical sagacity. POLICE HOSPITALS. The average strength of the Police Force during the past year in this division was 7,111, of these 2,448 have been under treatment, and 17 died. It has often been the subject of remark that this body of men, al- though obliged to undergo at times great fatigue, and exposed, as they are, to all vicissitudes of climate, is, as a rule, a remarkably healthy one. One reason no doubt for their immunity from disease is that the men who compose this force are usually enlisted from that part of the country in which they are called upon to serve, and seldom or ever leave it. When on my inspection tour I was able to visit and inspect every police hospital in the division, and take this opportunity of stating that I had every reason to be satisfied with the order and neatness, and also of the manner in which the medical officers conducted their duties. At a few stations, such as Dharmgaon, a separate and complete hospital exists, but in others the police are treated in the same ward as the civil patients. Whilst reporting favourably on the hospitals, I cannot say much in favour of some of the police lines, such as at Belgaum and others. The lines at Belgaum are very indifferent and have been repeatedly reported on, but nothing is done. The districts in which the police sepoy requires perhaps better shelter and more wholesome dwellings is Kanara, but here, however, the men are worse off than elsewhere. I was particularly impressed with this fact when at Mondegode, where, in a large delapidated house, capable of accommodating per- haps a good-sized family, I found the whole detachment located148 hospitals; and had it not been for the unhealthy state of the detach- ments located in the Kanara jungles, whose percentages of sick ranged from 70 to 170 to strength, the police would have shown a still more favourable return. By far the largest number of admissions to hospital took place from malarious fever. The total treated from this cause alone was 1,100, for I include the Kolapore cases, or 45 per cent. of the whole cases treated. It was observed that although many cases of fever were of a persistent charater, few were complicated, and death only resulted in 5 of them. Dr. Carter appends some tables to his report purporting to show the comparative treatment of intermittent fever, but I am inclined to think that the experiments made by him are on too limited a scale to be of much practical value. Rheumatic affections, syphilitic or otherwise, among this class of men, usually bear comparatively a high proportion of the cases treat- ed; but it has not been so last year, for there were only 161 ad- missions, one-third of which occurred at the Satara Hospital. Cases of guinea-worm are not unfrequently met with in a police hospital. The reason assigned is that the men when in the dis- tricts are compelled to drink all kinds of water, and no doubt in many instances from wells containing the germs of the guinea-worm; but be that at is may, all the Medical Officers affirm that the disease is not contracted during the patient's residence at head quarters, where the water is supposed to be pure and free from animalculi. In the surgical practice of the hospitals not much has taken place worthy of especial notice in this -report. Two cases of severe sword-cut wounds, detailed by Dr. Sylvester, and one of which prov- ed fatal, may be mentioned, together with a successful operation per- formed by the same officer for the radical cure of hernia. Vaccination has been performed when necessary by the Medical Officers during the year, and I am happy to state few cases of small- pox in the hospitals are recorded. At Kohlapur measles occurred in the month of November last. The epidemic was confined chiefly to the families of the police sepoys. CHARITABLE DISPENSARIES. (From the date of their establishment to the year 1871-72.) Preliminary Remarks.149 The charitable dispensaries of the 2nd Class are 3, and entirely supported by the States of Akalkot, Peynt, and Mudhole. In the 3rd Class there are 18 dispensaries, termed, for the sake of distinction, "Municipal Dispensaries," although they are in part supported by Government. They are widely spread over the Poona Division and Southern Maratha Circle, and, under the provisions of para. 14 of the revised rules, are now placed under the immediate supervision of the Civil Surgeon of the collectorate in which they are situated. They may be taken in the following order:150 GOVERNMENT DISPENSARIES. Kanara Collectorate. The oldest established Government dispensary is that at Sirsi. It is a town situated, like all other towns at which Government dispen- saries are fixed, deep in the Kanara jungles. It contains 5,329 in- habitants, most of whom are of the agricultural class, together with a few sowcars and shop-keepers. The old dispensary building was originally a detachment hospital built for the accommodation of Madras Troops, when North Kanara (Bala Ghaut) was under that Presidency. On the troops being with- drawn, it merged into a dispensary, and has remained so since 1862. In 1868 the municipality of Sirsi allotted the sum of Rs. 400 for the support and maintenance of in-door patients, and in 1869 erect- ed, at a cost of Rs. 6,000, the present dispensary hospital, converting the old detachment hospital or dispensary into quarters for the Hospi- tal Assistant. As I have before stated, this is one of the few dispensaries, the building of which meets all the requirements laid down by Govern- ment, and this is to be attributed partly to the liberality of the municipality and partly to the fact, that the subsidiary buildings were already provided for when the detachment hospital became a dispensary. This dispensary is entirely supported by Government. To this report a table is annexed showing the working of this dis- pensary, commencing from the date of its establisment in 1862 up to the present official year, from which it will be seen that after the first two years, the number of total sick treated considerably increased, but of course fluctuated according to the sickness which prevailed in each year. The return for the past official year, 1871-72, shows that the daily average number of persons attending the dispensary is 31. The total sick treated 3,439, and 13 deaths; but it must be understood that this return not only includes the townspeople, but many persons from the adjacent villages, who, with their families, gladly avail themselves of the medical aid and medicines hitherto afforded to them gratuitously from the dispensary. But whilst fully aware of the benefits of European medicines and medical treatment, I regret to say that vaccination does not meet with that reception it deserves151 had been held in honour of the goddess Devi. It lasted 8 days, during which period many thousands of people had collected to witness the ceremonies to be gone through, and which terminated in the slaughter of 9 bullocks, 1,000 sheep, and double that number of cocks, in order, as they said, to appease and propitiate the deity. The town and neighbourhood of Sirsi is well supplied with water, both for washing and drinking purposes, derived from mountain rivulets, tanks, and wells, the latter are fed by springs. The average rainfall is about 95 inches. Small-pox appears to be endemic throughout the whole of the Bala Ghaut. It was certainly very ripe in the months of February and March this year, when I was travelling through those districts. The limited assistance afforded to the vaccinator by native authori- ties has been the subject of frequent complaints made to me, both orally and in official reports. I was much pleased with the manner in which the work of the dispensary has been carried on, and consider Mr. 1st Class Hospital Assistant Benjamin Sullimanji very efficient, and from special enquiries made during my inspection I have every reason to believe that he has gained the confidence and good-will of the people entrusted to his charge. The following table will show the daily average number of attend- ance and the total number of sick treated, and deaths from 1862 up to 31st March 1872:152 There are two points here which cannot be passed over without observation, and they are, the very low rate of mortality as given in this table, and the very large number of persons returned under the head of absented. In what exact relation they stand to one another, of course I am not prepared to say, but I am afraid not a few of those who are classed under the latter head ought to be included in the former. The ratio of deaths to treated is 3.4 per mille, but exclusive of cholera, it is only 2 per thousand. After a very careful study of the reports and returns presented by the medical officers of these dis- pensaries, I am forced to the conclusion that there is very little in their past medical history worth recording The vast majority of cases treated were of a very ordinary nature, and presented no feature of any interest. The most prevalent diseases during the period under review were malarious fever, diseases of the stomach and bowels, and cutaneous diseases. These three diseases then, with others of their class, com- prise a total of 44,397, or 63 per cent. of the total sick treated. From malarious fever 14,501 persons sought medical aid at the dispensaries, and proportionatily the greatest sufferers were those residing in the Kanara Districts. The percentages of sick have, to whole cases treated, ranged from 55 to 68 per cent. The deaths from this cause were 24, or 16 per thousand. Diarrh153 The only operation of any moment performed was lithotomy. It was performed in two instances at the Poona dispensary on children under 10 years of age, and with success. On taking a review of these charitable dispensaries, as regards the buildings themselves, their establishments, and the work performed by them, since they were first established, I have come to the con- clusion that a great deal has yet to be accomplished before they can be said to be in a satisfactory condition. In respect to buildings, many of them are too small, and in no way meet the requirements necessary for a dispensary, whilst others, though well and substantially built, are deficient in subsidiary build- ings and in quarters for the medical officers in charge. But to this sub- ject I am particularly desirous of drawing the attention of the In- spector General, as I find that in the rules of 1861 no conditions are laid down, nor indeed is any mention made of the accommodation necessary for Sub-Assistant Surgeons or Hospital Assistants, and consequently advantages are being taken of this omission by Munici- pal Committees of dispensaries (formed before the revised rules of 1871 came into operation), to decline providing the requisite accommodation. The establishments, with few exceptions, are sufficient, but to all the larger dispensaries I think two Native pupils should be appointed. One of these should always be an advanced pupil, for occasions so frequently arise of the medical officer in charge being called away to give evidence in the Judicial Courts. This is more particularly needful where only one pupil is attached, for unless he is competent to undertake the duties during the absence of the Hospital Assistant, the dispensary is virtually closed. The operations, as carried on by the 3rd Class Hospital Assistants and others in charge of dispensaries, I am of opinion are, on the whole, progressive and satisfactory, and I am in hopes that when suitable dispensaries are built, and several are now in course of erec- tion, still further improvements will take place both in respect to the numbers relieved and importance of cases treated. From all I can learn on the subject, I have every reason to believe that these dispensaries are, as a rule, highly appreciated by the native community, and that they have been the means of benefiting a large class of persons who could not otherwise perhaps have received the benefits of medical aid and European medicines. But the crucial test of all this, no doubt, will be the amount of support they will afford to these institutions when the paying system comes into force. Yellapur154 This dispensary was opened by order of Government in 1863. The subjoined table will serve to show the extent of its operations during the past 9 years:155 The returns from this dispensary show the number vaccinated during the year was 203156 From this statement there is no reason to doubt but that the dispensary work has been steadily increasing, and the reports sub- mitted show that the people are gradually availing themselves of the benefits the institution holds out. The patients attending the dispensary are composed of three classes: the Karcoons attached to the Kutcherry and their families, with the families of police sepoys. The inhabitants of the town and sur- rounding villages, and the coolies employed by the Public Works Department. Although I have not been able to extend my tour of inspection, so far west as Supa, I am fully aware of its necessities. In a conversation with the Assistant Collector at Yellapore he informed me that it is proposed to build a dispensary as soon as funds are available157 these dispensaries were admirably selected for the purposes in view, and have since proved of the utmost benefit to a fever-stricken and suffering population. In March last I inspected this dispensary, and was glad to find a new building in course of erection. On examining the plans, how- ever, I saw no provision had been made for subsidiary buildings, such as a cook-house, latrine, and a dead-house. The room appropriated for the Hospital Assistant's quarter is also much too small, and I would suggest that a door be made in the wall, dividing that room from the surgery, and thus afford him two rooms instead of only one. The surgery can be moved into the main ward158 Vaccination seems to have been almost entirely neglected. Only 8 persons have been vaccinated in the year. Of course the medical officer complains of the ignorant and obstinate Lingayets and stiff- necked Brahmins, but I am inclined to think the poorer classes would have yielded a much larger return than the scanty one submit- ted, had the vaccinator only been ordinarily zealous or in any way alive to the great importance of the subject. Water is very scarce at Mondegode, and this no doubt is the source of much trouble and misery to its inhabitants. A tank has been formed, but the springs are scanty, and yield but an insufficient quantity of water for the wants of so large a population. Wells there are, but they soon go dry, and the Water in many of them, I understand, is indifferent. The Hospital Assistant in medical charge, in point of ability and aptitude for his work, is about the average, but I was happy to find on inquiries made of the native authorities and others that he is much liked in the town and neighbourhood, and his labours are appreciated. Halial159 deaths; but probably this return is only for a portion of the year, for the exact date and month in which it was opened cannot be fur- nished. In the subsequent year 1864 the average number of daily sick rose to 69, and the total number of persons treated 4,551, with a mortality of 13. During the following year the attendance at the dispensary has fallen far short of that shown in 1864, but it has been sufficiently uniform. In the past year, 1871-72, the daily average is 20.4, total treated 2,805, deaths 3. The report submitted by the Hospital Assistant in charge is a meagre one, and no mention is made of the progress of vaccination; but from enquiries made, when on my tour of inspection, I came to the conclusion that this important work was too much neglected. On my visit in March last I also regretted to find that, with the ex- ception of a new site, nothing had been done towards the erection of a new dispensary. The present one, as pointed out by my predecessor Dr. Pelly, so far back as April 1870, is nothing but a verandah and affords but a very imperfect protection for the instruments and drugs belonging to the institution. The site on which it is proposed to build the dispensary is in it- self unobjectionable, but I should have preferred one nearer the town. Not having had the advantage of seeing the plan of the new build- ing I can offer no opinion regarding it, but as 3,500 rupees, and pro- bably more, are to be expended on its erection, I have no doubt but that it will be one in every way suitable for a dispensary. Good water for drinking is now procurable from a large tank situated in the town, and also from various wells. Mr. Rama Sonar, the Hospital Assistant in charge, from what I saw of him, did not impress me with the idea that he was a man of much energy, but I understand he is popular, and in his professional capacity gives satisfaction. Indapur160 From the following statement of the total numbers treated since its commencement in 1865, I think the dispensary may fairly be said to have progressed, and that it has formed a great benefit to the town and neighbourhood. The total number of sick treated and died in each year is as follows:161 It was opened so far back as February 1864, but no records of its operations appear to have been kept up to 1870, and are herewith submitted in usual tabular form. The following table shows the total number of patients treated, the daily average number of attendance, and the number of deaths in each year:162 By last census there are 80,000 inhabitants in the city of Poona. Out of this vast population, 6,187, or 11 per cent., received medicines and medical advice from the dispensary. No doubt many more would have resorted to it, had there not been a large public hospital, with a well organised dispensary attached, open to them, and from which they can derive all the advantages obtainable from the skill and experience of its medical officers. But, apart from this, I am inclined to believe that if a spacious and suitable dispensary could be built by the Municipality and its present medical officer made to exercise a little more zeal and energy in the prosecution of his duties, a much larger proportion of the inha- bitants than at present would avail themselves of it. Annexed to this report is the statement showing the daily average number of attendance of sick and deaths in each year since the opening of the dispensary. The dispensary was opened on the 24th February 1853, and the tabular statement shows the working of the institution from that date up to the period under review. But the daily attendance and total treated in each year clearly indicate that its operations have been progressive and, up to a certain point, satisfactory. In the first 5 years of its existence the total number of persons treated was 17,160, but in the latter 5 years, that is, from 1867 to 1871-72, the numbers were 26,331, showing an in- crease of 9,271. The death rates vary according to the presence or otherwise of cholera in the city during the year, but are by no means to be con- sidered as a true index of the mortality as it occurred in those years.

164 CHARITABLE DISPENSARIES SUPPORTED BY MUNICIPALITIES. Sholapur Collectorate. The Sholapur dispensary may be taken as a fair type of a 1st class dispensary supported from Municipal funds. It was established in 1864, and opened for the reception of patients in September of that year. Since which period it has, I think, steadily maintained its position and usefulness as exemplified in the table statement appended to this report. Its daily average number of admissions for a series of years, has ranged from 60 to 90, and the number of persons treated in each year has risen from 3,161 to 5,760. On my tour of inspection in January last, I was gratified to find that since the last report a handsome dispensary had been erected by the Municipality just inside the town walls, at a cost of Rs. 12,000 The building contains a ward capable of accommodating 6 patients, a surgery, waiting-room, store room, and cook-house, which is separate from the main building. The quarters for a Hospital Assistant and medical pupils were in course of erection. It is reported that, owing to want of funds, the Municipality do not at present intend to admit in-door patients, and the report was strengthened by the fact that the cook-house was, on my visit, occupied by the dispensary peon and his family. Although a large sum of money has already been expended on this building, the important subsidiary buildings are still wanting, viz., a latrine and a dead-house. The Municipality are now drawing their attention to the water supply, and if schemes proposed are carried out, an abundant supply of good water will be obtainable165 STATEMENT showing the daily average number of Attendance, total number of Treated, and Deaths, in each year since 1st September 1864.

167 Pandharpur168 table will show the total number of sick treated and deaths in each year, together with the daily average attendance since 1867:169 The reason of its unhealthiness is two-fold: 1st, its natural position, placed as it is on the banks of two convergent streams, the Krishna and the Koina; and 2ndly, in consequence of filthy state of the town, narrowness of its streets, and, until lately, the want of pure water; for the river all around the town is more or less contaminated. Since a municipality has been formed the sanitary condition of the town is said to have improved, but it is still very far from being a clean or healthy one. The table annexed will indicate the progress of the operations of the institution as conducted by Mr. Ramchunder Dajee, the Medical Officer in charge. The dispensary building is situated quite outside the town, and on a site which, in point of salubrity, is well enough, but I am induc- ed to think not for the convenience of the inhabitants. It is a substantial building and contains a good surgery and receiv- ing room, and a ward sufficiently large to contain 4 patients. There is no house or room for the medical officer in charge, nor are there any subsidiary buildings attached to it. The present incumbent is obliged to reside in a house in the town and at some distance from his dispensary, which is objectionable. On my visit of inspection in February last, I was satisfied that the duties of the institution were being well and efficiently carried on by Mr. Ramchunder Dajee, who has the reputation of being an earnest, zealous man, and well qualified to conduct the duties of the dispensary. The average daily attendance, I think, is sufficient to show that the Hospital Assistant's labours are appreciated and that he has gained the confidence of the community. Although vaccination is not alluded to in Mr. Ramchunder Dajee's report, I was given to understand that the operations had been regularly conducted at the dispensary; but the usual complaints were made of the difficulty with which it was carried on owing to the prejudice of numbers of the Lingayets and other classes Epidemic diseases. Small-pox is reported to have been prevalent both in the town and the surrounding villages in February and March last, but only a few cases have been treated at the dispensary. The town and neighbourhood have been free from cholera during the period under review, but as the medical officer justly remarks, this exemption may be ascribed more to the general healthiness of the season than to the sanitary measures under- taken to improve and clean the town. People residing in the north and east parts of the town are sup- plied with good drinking-water from the Krishna Canal by means of an aqueduct, and a few hawoods, or small reservoirs, have been built in different parts of it, so that as regard good potable water the people may be said to be well off.

In which during the past 12 years 37,224 persons have been treated and 64 have died, or, in other words, only one and a half persons in every thousand treated died annually. A decrement so small as to render the returns so far untrustworthy. Vaccination seems to be but irregularly performed at the dispen- sary. It is however fairly carried out in the town by the Municipal Vaccinator. The usual complaints are made by the Hospital Assist- ant regarding the religious prejudices of the people, but now that stringent orders have been issued touching the weekly perform- ance of vaccination at the different parts of the town, I trust the next year's return will show an increase in point of numbers vaccinated. Few cases of small-pox were treated at the dispensary, though the disease was rife in the town and neighbourhood. The water supply for drinking purposes is obtained from wells, and is on the whole good, and in ordinary times sufficient, but in a scanty monsoon, such as the last, some privations in this respect must be felt.

184 Irandol185 Mohen Mallee has been just promoted to his present grade, and was only sent to the dispensary as a temporary measure. Vaccination, I am afraid, has been too much disregarded during the past year, but I trust will, for the future, be steadily practised here, lymph being at all times obtainable from Dhurungaum, which is only 10 miles distant. In the month of August last cholera visited the town, 29 persons were attacked, and 10 died. Formerly the town had an unenviable notoriety for being one of the dirtiest and most unhealthy in Khandesh, but since it has had a muni- cipality a great change for the better has taken place. Streets have been opened out and cleaned, and sanitary measures of various kinds adopted, so that it can by no means now be said to be either dirty or insalubrious. Akalkot186 The town in which it is situated contains about 6,000 inhabitants, and is on the high road between Maligam and Ahmadnagar. This was one of the dispensaries inspected by me when on tour, and I am sorry to state I was not favourably impressed either with the dispensary itself or the manner in which it was being conducted. The building is in the heart of the town and densely surrounded by houses. The accommodation it affords is simply a covered verandah by a wall, against which, and in the open, a bench is placed for the convenience of patients attending. As regards then its site and the accommodation it affords, nothing could be more unsuitable and inadequate for the purposes in view, and I trust the Municipality will be moved to erect, without delay, a proper building. The usual statement is withheld, as after repeated injunctions to the Native Doctor to furnish the same, it was found to be after its re- ceipt so totally untrustworthy as to render it useless for our present purpose. The Medical Subordinate in charge was formerly, I understand, on the regular establishment and (I presume) took his discharge. At any rate he was not appointed to this dispensary by the Inspector General, but by the Municipality at the recommendation of the Vin- choorker, a gentleman who at one time seems to have taken an in- terest in the welfare of the institution. I do not consider Mr. Wittoo Ramjee a fit person to be trusted with so important a charge. His annual report shows that his pro- fessional knowledge is scanty, and he has not had that training in one of our civil hospitals or the Grant College, which a man requires. before he is likely to be competent to undertake the duties of a dispensary. Peint187 The table appended to this report will give a fair index of the working of this dispensary. On the whole it cannot be said to be a success, but now that a new Hospital Assistant has been appointed, and that under the new rules it is placed under the immediate supervi- sion of the Civil Surgeon at Nasik, I anticipate next year's return will show great improvement. This dispensary, as before mentioned, is entirely supported by the Peint State through the Collector and Magistrate of Nasik. The following table shows the total number of patients treated, the daily average number of attendance, and the number of deaths in each year:ANNUAL REPORT. OF THE CIVIL, POLICE, AND JAIL HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES IN THE NORTHEN DIVISION OF THE ARMY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1872. Ahmadabad, 1st April 1872. My summary of the medical reports from Civil Department in the districts under my supervision refer, with the exception of the one dispensary at Mhow, exclusively to establishments in the Northern Division, which are as follows:190 well conducted under the charge of a Graduate of Grant Medical College. Returns are sent through me to the Inspector General. A dispensary has also been established at Mandvi. I have visited all these establishments except Dohad and Godhra. Ahmadabad. Lunatic Asylum. Of the public charities at Ahmadabad, I think that the lunatic asylum holds the first place for completeness and efficiency. It is the only asylum with- in a radius of 300 miles. Since the last report the additions to the north wing have been completed, giving an addition of 12 cells. One hundred patients can now be accommodated. There being 57 cells on the separate system, and the females, of whom there are 17 inmates are completely shut off from the rest of the establishment. Of the criminal lunatics, 19 in number, all are males, and with them the type of insanity is usually acute mania. The occupations of the women are chiefly spinning, the men are employed in the excellent garden, where they work well and cheer- fully. The average number so employed has been 51, and the value of earnings of each 10 rupees 14 annas. The cost of each patient is estimated at 98 rupees without deduction of value of labour. No physical restraint has been found necessary. Only strict super- vision and sometimes separation. At the commencement of the year there were present 90 patients: Admitted 26 Died 8 Discharged well 15 Given over to charge of friends 12 Remaining 84 I can add nothing to Dr. Wyllie's report, but, considering the in- creased number of inmates, and for the reasons urged by Dr. Wyllie, I would certainly recommend that the establiment should be increased as suggested The present establishment is191 Ahmadabad. The civil hospital is a well-built well-adapted and sightly build- ing, with good out-houses and a large compound situated in a cen- tral part of the town in a tolerably open space; it has room for 90 patients, but considering that the population of the town is 105,000, and that 50 per cent. of the patients are from other parts of the country, the accommodation is quite insufficient; as it is, 40 patients, chiefly lepers, paralytics, cases of small-pox, &c., are lodged and well cared for in a range of buildings outside the town within an extensive walled enclosure. The civil hospital can be enlarged, either by adding an upper storey, or by building fresh wards on the ground-floor; there is space within the compound. The Beechurdass Dispensary has room for 6 in-patients, these are chiefly cases requiring surgical operations, and I have included these operations in the return of civil hospitals. The total cases treated in Ahmadabad192 charge devolves upon the Regimental Surgeon, who may or may not be a man zealous and fond of operative surgery. The total treated was 538 Died 43 Average Daily Sick 36 Deaths to Treated 7 There were 13 capital amputations, chiefly for mycetoma 5 Died. Lithotomy cured, 35 2 " Besides several important operations. Ligature of subclavian for aneurism Successful.

At Rajkot the lepers are kept in a hospital under supervision of the Political Agent and the Civil Surgeon. No returns are sent. Kaira. There have been but few patients treated during the past year; this, I think, is in consequence of the imperfect accommodation the hospital affords; but it will improve, I hope, when the new hospital is built193 flap was taken from the forehead. To summarise the cases treated in civil hospitals in this division194 pline is well maintained, and several trades taught. At Dhuliakot the subsidiary jail is a large, well ventilated building, receiving more than 400 prisoners; both have well cultivated gardens attached, supplying an ample stock of vegetables. The jails at Rajkot, Kaira, and Dohad are much smaller; Kaira holding 100 prisoners, Rajkot 87, at 648 cubic feet to each individual. There have been no epidemics during the year, and no sickness calling for any special remark. The strength has been 1,110 Total treated 1,016 Died 19 Daily average 20 Treated to strength 91.5 Died to strength 1.7 Died to treated 1.8 The rate of sickness and mortality in each jail was:195 The percentages of treated, &c., is given below:196 in charge of the dispensary at Dholka is the only man who is really very good amongst hospital assistants. No capital operations have been performed at any of the dispen- saries in charge of hospital assistants, except at Dholka: 2 amputa- tions of the finger, and at Borsad a secondary operation, removing a fore-arm crushed and mortified; 112 dislocations and fractures have been reduced. I think it would be of value statistically, if a register was kept and return furnished of all post-mortems and of cases in which the evi- dence of the hospital assistant might have been called for at the sessions. In the returns appended it will be seen that there have been treat- ed during the year 1871-72, 151,535, and 149 died. In most of the dispensaries vaccination has been carried on, but the medical officers have all been enjoined to pay particular attention to this branch of their duty. I am in hopes that by strict supervision and instruction from the civil surgeons, and myself by sending for and correcting cases, the hospital assistants will improve in knowledge and usefulness. It will be seen by the return of treated. in the dispensaries that the total amounted to 151, 535, and deaths 149. This ratio of deaths to treated is of little value, as will be seen by referring to the table. Of continued fevers treated, 681, there were no deaths, rheumatic affections 5,194, no deaths, disease of lungs 7,258, deaths 17, surgical operations 112, one death. Herewith a summary of the class of diseases treated:197 Ulcer 6,765 6 Died. Skin disease 38,506 1 " Other diseases of this class 12,730 9 " Old age 832 ... " Poisons 450 4 " Injuries 3,921 16 " Surgical operations 112 1 " Malarious fever gives the largest total of serious diseases, about 16 per cent. Under the head skin disease and disease of other class are no less than 50,236 treated, or one-third of the total sick; of eruptive fever there were only 104 admitted, and 8 cases of cholera have been treated. Diarrhoea and dysentery and disease of stomach and bowels give the next largest total, but in these are included the very numerous cases, relieved by a dose of medicines, and entered as indigestion or constipatio. Diseases of the eye includes a great number of cases of simple conjunctivitis easily cured. The surgical operations performed have been almost confined to minor operations; cases requiring more experienced treatment, I think, usually resort to the hospitals at the sadder towns. I will now go into the history of the several dispensaries establish- ed independent of civil hospitals. I have appended a return showing the yearly total of treated in all the dispensaries since their establishment, and it will be seen that, with few exceptions, there has been a constant yearly increase of admissions.

206 In conclusion, as bearing on the general health of the province, I beg to remark how much the general well-being of the community is sacrificed to the greed or laziness of individuals in the villages, in the neglect of attention to ordinary sanitary rules. In the greater num- ber of villages, particularly in the Kaira Collectorate and adjoining Guicowaree districts, close to the centre circle of houses and adjoining the roads, are deep ditches in which cattle manure and human ordure lies seething till it is required for the fields, the stench in passing these villages at night is sickening; also on all sides of the road around the village manure heaps are deposited, and, as in most villages, this road leads to the tank by a time-worn slope, the walls of the tank being lowered by constant traffic, the first fall of rain washes out these road-side ditches, and the tank is filled with this liquid manure. These manure heaps should not be so immediately in contact with the dwelling-houses, and the feeders of the tank should be attended to. What enables the villagers to maintain average health, I believe to be the fact, that a great many live in their fields day and night in open sheds.
No. 415 of 1872. FROM THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, Indian Medical Department, Sind District; To THE COMMISSIONER IN SIND, Kurrachee. Kurrachee, 21st May 1872. SIR, I do myself the honour to forward, for your information, the follow- ing report embracing the medical history of the various civil hospitals, dispensaries, and jails throughout the Province of Sind for the official year 1871-72; also that of the Cowasjee Jehangeer Lunatic Asylum at Giddu-ka-Tanda; the health of the prisoners and police, and the amount of vaccination, with results carried out at the above institutions, and which is quite distinct from the work under- taken by the Vaccination Department. Since the receipt of last year's administrative report, the civil hospitals and dispensaries in this province have been neither increas- ed nor diminished. They are as follows:208 sibilities of their duties and position, and have endeavoured faithfully to discharge these to the best of their abilities. In some instances, which I will mention further on, this has been most marked, and I shall have much pleasure, when speaking of the separate changes, in bringing the names of these individuals to your notice. 5. In stating the results of the medical practice in the civil establishments of this province, I will content myself with merely giving you a general statement of the sickness and mortality as wit- nessed at them, believing that you neither require nor would appreciate a more scientific arrangement necessitating, as it would, my introduc- ing professional and technical terms. 6. The numbers treated therefore in the several hospitals and dispensaries for the past official year are of two classes, in-door and out-door. I will first of all enumerate the former with their results, beginning with the civil hospitals, and following with the dispen- saries. It must be borne in mind, however, that the police are not included in the in-door patients of civil hospitals, but are returned separately; but this is not the case elsewhere, as the regulations have not as yet provided for their seperation in dispensaries, though this will be done in future. At present they are included under the general head of in-patients at these institutions. Civil Hospitals. Remained on 31st March 1871. Admitted during the year. Total. Cured. Died.

Preserving the same order, I will now give the numbers treated as out-patients at the various civil hospitals and dispensaries in Sind; but in place of showing any deaths from among these, I Will instead note the number who have absented themselves. This omission of deaths is very necessary, for although the mortality is of course con- siderable, yet the information on this point, which can be brought to book in the dispensary records, is extremely limited, Owing to the irregular and spasmodic attendance of this class, to the fluctuating state of the population, to the applicants for relief frequently being travellers, or others coming from a distant village for advice and medicine, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, who subsequently die, and who ought, strictly speaking, to appear on the casualty list of the different dispensaries which helped them in their distress. But this is of course impossible, and to record, therefore, the few deaths occurring in the village or town in which the dispensary is situated, as a set off against the thousands who have been treated, as I have noticed frequently to be done, without having the power of taking cognisance of the many who pass on to die elsewhere, and to attempt to draw a ratio per cent. of deaths to treated from such erroneous premises, is to arrive at deductions as untrustworthy as they are illogical.

211 8. By comparison with the number of in-door and out-door pa- tients treated in these same hospitals and dispensaries for the previous official year, which will be found in the administrative report for- warded you by my predecessor, it will be seen that there is an increase of some 4,332 patients; and when it is remembered that the past year has been an exceptionally healthy one, specially in the matter of malarious fevers, it will be admitted that the appreciation in which these establishments are regarded by the people, and the growing tendency there exists to take advantage of their benefits, are well marked, and constitute an encouraging feature as to the benefi- cial results these institutions are conferring upon the inhabitants at large. 9. It would be erroneous, however, to attempt to gather from these returns any idea of the healthiness of the people throughout the province, or of the amount of mortality which has prevailed dur- ing the past year. 10. It is pleasant to have to record that Sind has been entirely free from cholera, though this disease has prevailed to a consider- able extent in the Persian Gulf and adjoining countries, nor has any form of epidemic disease visited the country. Small-pox has been reported here and there, and it certainly has been witnessed in a few isolated cases; but beyond these it is extremely doubtful whether the disease reported as small-pox was in reality such. Consi- dering the highly contagious nature of this malady, it is far more probable that the affection was the comparatively harmless one called chicken-pox, which has here and there been prevalent, and which is not infrequently mistaken for the other disease in its modified form. Measles have prevailed to some extent in Kurrachee, at Manora, lately at Haidarabad, and in a few of the smaller towns in Sind; but it has been so partial as hardly to deserve the name of "epidemic," and the mortality from this affection, so far as I have heard, has been insignificant. Hooping-cough also has been witnessed to a slight extent, but this complaint was confined chiefly to Manora, and for a few months among the Parsees at Kurrachee. It was noticed also lately at Haidarabad. The affection has proved mild and tractable. But fever212 the people, they are likewise exposed to the extremes of great heat and cold; and this not only during what may be termed the normal periods of the year, viz., summer and winter, but at other times also, and that suddenly, and within the 24 hours. I allude specially to the cold season. At this time during the day the sun's rays elevate the thermometer often to 100º, while during the night, and particularly towards morning, when the system is peculiarly susceptible to climatic influences, the temperature is fre- quently at the freezing point, and even below it, These sudden changes do not take place without their injurious effects being occasionally felt by the well-fed, well-clothed, and comfortably- housed portion of the community; but they act with tenfold greater energy on the ill-fed, poorly clad, and insufficiently protected classes. Hence it is not surprising that a very considerable mortality is known to have occurred in many of the smaller towns and hamlets throughout Sind, the residents of which have had little or no medi- cal assistance from dispensaries in the neighbourhood. This morta- lity has been particularly observed during the cold season, and its explanation is not difficult. The malaria poison induces a vitiated condition of the system, the prominent symptom, in the absence of fever, being a low state of vital energy. This renders the individual peculiarly susceptible of atmospheric changes; and under these cir- cumstances, without the greatest circumspection, imflammation of the lungs and their investing membranes are a frequent occurrence. The disease generally comes on suddenly, and. in such cases, debilita- ted by the causes I have already mentioned, recovery in the absence of judicious treatment is seldom witnessed. It would be quite out of place to term this disease "epidemic," however common it may be. The more correct expression would be to call it "endemic," born and bred in the soil, just as fever is, and developed in indivi- duals already prepared for its reception through climatic influen- ces acting on their depraved constitutions and faulty modes of living. It would be equally incorrect to consider this mortality in any way infectious or dependent upon a special contagion. From what I have said it will hardly be necessary for me to stop to combat this opinion, which, I am aware, has in some quarters been advanced. I merely notice it to pronounce emphatically against it. 12. A number of deaths likewise have occurred in various parts of the Province from affections of the bowels, chiefly diarrh213 been put forward to account for its prevalence, especially in Upper Sind, but none of these are very satisfactory. I think, however, the difficulty is met by remembering that springs of fresh water, the product indirectly of a regular are nearly unknown in Sind, and that almost the entire supply of drinking-water used by the people is derived from the Indus or through some of its numerous canals and cuttings. This great river passing over in its course exten- sive beds of limestone and other saluble earthly salts, holds large quantities of these in solution. Every time a native drinks he swallows also a certain quantity of these earthly salts, which, were he in rebust health, well-fed, and suitably clothed, he would get rid off by the natural outlets. But the malarious poison in which he lives lowers his vital energy and his ability to resist morbid actions in his system; and the extreme and sudden changes of temperature to which he is exposed, and which are specially observable in Upper Sind, still further help in the half-fed, scantily clothed native, to throw extra work on some organs at the expense of others, the result of which is frequently seen primarily in the kidneys, and sub- sequently in the bladder, which participates in the general vital depres- sion of the whole system. A crystal or slight deposit is retained, which serves as a nucleus, around which one or more calculi are gradually formed. Nearly all the cases of stone which apply for relief at the civil hospitals and dispensaries are according to this theory from the districts north of Haidarabad. In the southern portions of Sind, where the climate is more equable, and a freer action of the skin is main- ained, this affection is not so frequently witnessed. 14. Haidarabad being the general centre to which so many natives resort for business or pleasure, it is but natural to expect a larger number of cases would be met with there than elsewhere, especially as the present Surgeon, Dr. Holmested, has a name among the people for his skill and attention. And such is the case. As many as 55 operations for stone have been performed at the Haidarabad Hospital during the past official year, of these 7 terminated fatally. Few opera- tions, comparatively, for this disease, have been witnessed in the other hospitals or dispensaries, with the exception of Alhar-ka-Tanda, where the Apothecary, Mr. Wright, has had several, and been toler- ably successful. Success in operations for this complaint, especially where the patients are well known and come from a distance, proves of great general benefit; others suffering in like manner are encouraged to come in, and if they also succeed in obtaining permanent relief, the advantages of surgical operations come to be widely known and appreciated. 15. The total strength of the Police, as is shown from the hospi- tal returns of the Collectorate towns, amounts to 1,681; but as these are scattered all over the province, and when sick are absorbed in the general mass of patients attending dispensaries, it follows that, according to the system adopted until lately, very little concerning their ailments, number of sick, ratio of recoveries to treated, or of deaths to treated can be statistically ascertained. The returns from 27 M D
214 the Police hospitals situated at head quarters would be valuable to these ends were the mon individually the same; but while the average strength is subject to little variation, constant changes are occurring in the persons. Only healthy men are sent away on out-post duty; sickly ones are frequently returned. These rapidly help to increase the sick roll, are at length cured or die, and give place to others, perhaps, similarly circumstanced, It is easy to see how imperfect must be statistics based upon returns which are them- selves the offspring of error, but which the system initiates and helps to keep up. 16. The following table shows the average strength of the pri- soners in the large jails in the province during the past official year, their admissions and deaths, the ratios per cent. of treated to strength, of deaths to strength, and of deaths to treated:215 in a few instances, there was room for improvement. This is specially the case in the civil hospital at Kurrachee. This hospital being situated in the largest and most important town in Sind, is the one of all others where it would be natural to expect that everything connected with it might be held up as a model of administration, discipline, order, and efficiency. I regret to say that my knowledge of it leads to a some- what different conclusion. A reference to the table of admissions, which is generally a fair test of the amount of work performed, and the estimation in which an hospital or dispensary is held by the natives, is disappointing. They are less than half the numbers shown in the civil hospital at Haidarabad. In making this statement I do not forget that at Haidarabad there is no separate dispensary to carry off patients as there is at Kurrachee; but taking the popu- lation of the two places, Haidarabad at 40,000 and Kurrachee at 80,000, and deducting the 12,308 admissions at the Kurrachee dispen- sary, the total of in-door and out-door patients, excluding the Police treated at this hospital, amounting to 7,180, are very few compared with similar totals for the same period at Haidarabad, which number 15,034. Even to non-professional eyes the contrast must be strik- ing; but when matters below the surface are looked into the explanation is not difficult. Had the medical officer in charge bestowed the time and attention on the various duties and details necessarily belonging to an institution of this magnitude and importance, I cannot help thinking that the results would have been different. But when visits are often hurried and superficial, when orders given are imperfectly carried out, when unbounded but mis- placed confidence is reposed in the apothecary, whose only aim seems to have been the securing of his own private interests, when, in short, supervision is lax, and interest in the thorough and efficient working of the establishment is not the centre from which the whole surroundings should be influenced, the machine speedily gets out of order, works heavily, and the results are unsatisfactory. 19. From this view it is pleasant to examine the working of a similar hospital216 charge of it during the past year. The present one, Dr. Murphy, is a diligent, well informed surgeon, and takes an interest in his work. The hospital is almost entirely given up to the reception of natives and the Police. The Europeans treated at Kotrí are, with a few trifling exceptions, all classed as out-patients. Its situation in days gone by was considered good, but now, owing to the number of large trees which have grown up around it, all breeze nearly is excluded; but this is not a matter of much moment, seeing that Europeans are rarely or never accommodated inside. There is a difficulty, however, of disposing of the refuse water, which under any circumstances requires to be remedied. The hospital being on the upper storey, this water can only be thrown over the verandah at the back to the ground below, and as the quantity thus disposed of is necessarily considerable, the soil underneath is always more or less damp, and is not therefore in a good sanitary condition. Close by there is an old drain, which merely requires a small expense to render it serviceable, and if this were connected by an iron pipe to the hospital above, the present nuisance would be completely removed. At Shikarpur the civil hospital, except for the use of the Police, might almost be done away with. It is at a considerable distance from the town, where there is an excellent dispensary, and few at least of the in-door patients would perhaps come to this hospital, were it not that they are for the most part in a wretched and indi- gent condition, and go there more for food, clothes, and shelter than for medical treatment. The building itself is commodious, but the two principal wards are quite unprovided with ventilation. A few small apertures pierce the roof, but these are useless. Were a suc- cession of loop holes, two feet apart, cut through the upper third of the walls, ventilation would be thoroughly established. 22. The last civil hospital to be noticed is the one at Sakkhar. It occupies a portion of the old artillery barracks. The accommoda- tion is unlimited, ventilation and other arrangements satisfactory. It is under the charge of Honorary Assistant Surgeon. Leahy, who, under the adverse circumstances of indifferent health, a bad climate, and multifarious duties, has conducted the duties of this hospital in a creditable manner. 23. At Manora the dispensary is quite unsuited to the require- ments of the place. It consists merely of a small surgery in one of the out-houses belonging to the quarters of the Assistant Apothecary. The want of a ward sufficient to accommodate, say, four patients, is much felt. The Apothecary has had, during the past year, several accidents and serious cases to treat, and has been compelled to attend the patients in their own huts. This arrangement is most un- satisfactory, and it is very desirable that a suitable building should be erected, having under the same roof a small surgery, and a room of convenient size to admit of four patients being received for treat- ment. A dispensary servant is likewise required to perform the various menial duties, which, owing to his absence, are at present thrown upon the Apothecary's private servant.
217 24. The Kurrachee Dispensary, supported by the Municipality, has done fairly. The admissions have been fewer by about 3,000 than was the case in the previous year. This is attributed to the com- parative healthiness of the past year; but I think also something may be owing to the fact of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon living in camp, and not, as a rule, visiting the dispensary in the evening. But now that the new rules require dispensaries to be attended morning and evening by the medical officer in charge, his living so far away is very inconvenient. He states that no suitable house can be found in the neighbourhood, and with the view of removing this objection, I think the Municipality should be moved to build quartes for the Sub- Assistant Surgeon near the dispensary. 25. As regards Tatta great improvement in the present dispen- sary arrangement is called for. More than half of the dispensary is appropriated as the residence of the apothecary, there being no suit- able house where he and his family can live; and the evil of this is that the in-patients are treated in a miserable place in the town at least 1/4th of a mile distant. Either a house ought to be built for the apothecary, and the present building given up entirely for dispensary use, or a new dispensary erected. 26. Matters at Khetty are, however, infinitely worse. The dispen- sary there is merely a hut built of mats; and as this is rather an important place, with a rich municipality, who only lately have con- structed a large iron dhurmsalla, it is a matter of surprise that they should show such apathy and indifference in a much more important matter, viz., the erection of a good substantial dispensary. 27. The dispensary at Sihwan is located in an old mosque in the town. The accommodation is sufficient, but the situation is objec- tionable, it being close to the market, surrounded by houses, and dis- tant at least 1/4th of a mile from the apothecary's quarters. It has been proposed to transfer the dispensary to the school-house, which is commodious and well situated in an open quarter of the town, not far from the River Arrol. It is conveniently placed for the inhabit- ants, and is also close to the apothecary's house; and a still further recommendation is the presence of several large trees, the shade of which would at all seasons be most acceptable to the patients visiting the dispensary. As the mosque and out-buildings now used as the dispensary would make an excellent and convenient school- house, I strongly recommend the transfer being effected. 28. The Halla Dispensary is what formerly was the District Jail. The space is greater than is ever likely to be required for hospital purposes, but commodious as it is, I found in it two evils, the one was the absence of ventilation, and which could be supplied at small cost. A few loop holes under the roof, or a small window here and there, Would answer the purpose. The other is not so easily reme- died. The wards are on a level with the ground, and in heavy rain, or after a high flood in the Indus, the floors, which are of mud, par- take of the general dampness around.
218 29. Mr. Wright, the Apothecary at Alhyar-ka-Tanda, is by his intel- ligence and fondness for his profession attracting many of the people of the surrounding villages to his dispensary. He is a fair operator, and has of late been successful in several stone cases which have been rumoured about in the neighbourhood, and the attendance at the dispensary has increased in consequence. By order of the Magistrate and President, Haidarabad District Municipalities, Mr. Wright visits once every month the towns of Adam-ka-Tanda, Mussurpoor, and Mirpur Khas, remaining at each two or three days. A visit of this duration is of very questionable benefit to the people, but is productive of great injury to the apothecary's legiti- mate work at Alhyar-ka-Tanda, as was evidenced by the somewhat unsa- tisfactory state in which I found, the records, instruments, and medicines at his dispensary. I would desire to bring this matter to your notice, as this constant going and coming on the part of the apothecary quite unsettles him, and prevents his giving a proper amount of attention and care to his duties at Alhyar-ka-Tanda, while the bene- fits resulting from such hurried visits are very doubtful. The natives around should rather be encouraged to come to him, and as regards one of the towns visited219 medical aid on the person in charge of the dispensary, there being no other experienced medical officer nearer than at Kotri. On all these grounds, therefore, and remembering also that Tatta, with the surrounding neighbourhood, is at all times rather an unhealthy locality, I would urge no change being made in the rank of the medical subordinate stationed there. 30. I was greatly surprised on visiting Larkhana, to find that a large and important town such as this possessed the worst dispensary in all Sind. Situated near the edge of a large canal, it ought to have been raised on a plinth. In place of this it seems purposely to have been sunk below the surface, for on entering the building the floor descends for nearly a foot. The dispensary is constantly damp, the earthern floors dark and sodden looking, and the walls in every direction have the plaster falling off up to fully 4 feet from the ground. To make matters worse, the construction of the building is so faulty, consisting of 3 narrow, low- roofed corridors, that ventilation is nearly impossible; neither doors nor windows exist at the two ends, and those at the sides are so low and narrow as to be nearly useless. Little or no space inside is available for conveniently placing the cots; altogether the place, owing to its darkness, damp, and close, mouldy smell, reminded me of a charnel-house fitted more for the reception of the dead than the cure of the living. The Mooktyarkar, who is also Secretary to the Muni- cipality, informed me that it was all, but decided to build a new dis- pensary, and he showed me several spots which were available for the purpose. One of these was in every way so much superior to the others, that I begged he would state my views on the matter to the municipality. The site I selected is not far from the present dispen- sary, on a fine, open piece of ground, shaded by several large trees, conveniently placed for the town, and some 80 yards distant from the canal. I particularly impressed upon the Mooktyarkar the ne- cessity of raising the new building on a suitable plinth and protecting it with verandahs on the south and west sides. 31. I can report favourably of the dispensary at Tarusha only from the end of September last, when it came under the charge of an excellent hospital assistant, who was formerly at the civil hospital, Haidarabad. For some months previous to that it had been sadly neglected by the medical subordinate who was there; but since he was removed the attendance has greatly increased. 32. Although the population of Mehur is small, containing only some 2,500 souls, the attendance at the dispensary has amounted to 2,279. A good portion of these, however, is contributed by the people of the neighbouring villages, who readily come in for medicines and advice. The dispensary itself is a poor place. It has existed for the last 22 years, and is a small irregular building in a very confined com- pound. The accommodation hitherto has been found sufficient, but the ventilation is most imperfect, and the premises require consider- able repair.
220 33. There is an excellent dispensary at Shikarpur, the popula- tion of which, and the surrounding villages, is very considerable; and although it possesses, among other advantages, the services of a good apothecary, yet the attendance is not so great as one would na- turally expect considering the importance of the place. The numbers treated for the year have amounted only to 5,998, and no surgical operations of consequence have been performed. The apothecary is well reported of, but he can hardly have succeeded in gaining the confidence of the people, or the result would, I think, be different. I trust, however, before next year to have a more encouraging account. 34. The people who resort to the dispensary at Sakkhar are those residing there, and also the inhabitants of old Sakkhar, nearly a mile distant. It is working satisfactorily, the daily average of in-patients, being 14.2, and of the out-door ones 31.3. The compound in which this dispensary stands is extremely small and much encroached upon by houses in the rear. It would be desirable if one or two of these tene- ments were purchased, and the space added to the dispensary, as at present the latrine is close to it, and quarters also are much needed for the hospital establishment. 35. The Government dispensary at Rohri has apparently done fairly during the past year. In addition to the townspeople, travellers take advantage of it, and the inhabitants of the surround- ing villages have also shown a readiness to come in for medicine and advice. It is under the care of a steady, tolerably well-informed medical subordinate, who has been at Rohri now for some years, and the people are gradually taking to him. 36. The dispensary established at Sakkhar for the use of the Punjab Flotilla has been well conducted by the hospital assistant in charge, and under the able superintendence of Honorary Assistant Surgeon Leahy. Besides native workmen, there have been some 30 Europeans and their families resident there; also all those passing up and down on board the steamers. A small dispensary, therefore, efficiently conducted was much needed, and has thoroughly answered. The Flotilla has been abolished from 1st of April 1872, and with it the dispensary also. 37. The dispensary at Jacobabad is peculiar, both from its posi- tion on the frontier and the class of people who obtain relief at it. Owing to its situation being in the direct line to Shikarpur and Sakkhar from Khandahar and the northward, large kafilas and numerous travellers are continually passing through the village, where they halt for a longer or shorter period. This class furnishes a considerable portion of the applicants for medical relief. There are also large numbers of migratory tribes who come down from the hills in the cold season to feed their cattle in the surrounding plains. Subjects likewise of the Khan of Khelat, Murrees, Boogties, and inhabitants of Affghanistan are annually treated in this dispensary; and many of these come thus far for the express purpose of subjecting them- selves to treatment for diseases which they have found their own
221 Hakeems powerless to cure. Considering the wide extent of territory which contributes its quota from various peoples to converge towards Jacobabad to obtain the relief denied them in their own country, the interests to humanity, and the political importance arising out of the friendly relations thus established, it is a matter of regret that this dispensary is not on a more extended scale, and one better suited for meeting the necessities which are constantly arising owing to the fluctuating population surrounding this station, especially in the cold season. From statistics kept in the dispensary, it appears that during the year 1871 only 42 per cent. of the total admissions were from actual residents in Jacobabad, the remainder coming from foreign and other parts of British territory. This institution, therefore, is one of those to which the population test does not strictly apply, and requires special treatment; moreover, as this is an important frontier capital station, and the knowledge that in it a public hospital existed, into which all, without reference to caste or creed, would be freely admitted, and were certain to receive medical aid on the most approv- ed European principles, a certain amount of political gain would accrue to Government by erecting and keeping up an hospital or good sized dispensary; and to ensure which the expenditure of the necessary sum would be comparatively of little moment; but the present building with its establishment is not at all calculated to fulfil the requirements thus indicated. Some six months ago there was submitted for my approval the plans of an hospital proposed to be erected at Jacobabad. I suggested some alterations which were adopted, but for the present I believe the matter has been shelved. 38. As regards the work done at this dispensary it has been very satisfactory, considering the extremely limited accommodation at com- mand: upwards of 3,000 patients have been treated, and, besides many minor operations, 23 important ones have been performed during the past year. Dr. Byramjee, the medical officer in charge, is cer- tainly zealous, and gives great attention to all professional matters. He deserves considerable credit for the manner in which he has made the best of the difficulties he has had to contend with in con- ducting this dispensary. 39. Kippra possesses the only dispensary established under the rules of 1867. It was opened in August 1868, and receives from Goverment Rs. 600 per annum as a grant-in-aid. It has a small population of not more than 2,000 souls, but many people from the districts around apply for aid at this dispensary. It is well thought of by the natives, as a daily average attendance of 31 sufficiently indicates. 40. By far the most important dispensary in the Thar and Parkar Districts is the one at -Umarkot, where upwards of 4,000 patients were treated during the past year. This number is out of all proportion to the population of Umarkot, which does not exceed 2,800 persons, but the large number of sick is accounted for by the influx of numer- ous famine-stricken Marwarries and people from Rajputana, who 28 M D
222 flocked into Umarkot during the great scarcity which last year prevailed in those districts. The present accommodation is very poor, and ill-suited for the requirements of an important place like Umar- kot; but this will be so no longer, as a larger and excellent dispen- sary is almost completed and ready for the reception, not only of the ordinary patients, but also for the Police, who require a small separate ward for themselves. 41. The Mittee and Nagar Parkar Dispensaries have been work- ing fairly, and they are proving themselves acceptable to the people in these parts. 42. There are two other dispensaries remaining, the one at Mahomed Khan223 or three iron tanks half filled with charcoal and coarse sand, I would strongly recommend this arrangement being carried out forthwith. Plans and estimates have been before Government for bringing into Haidarabad a never-failing and abundant supply of good water from the Foolaili, which is a want universally felt by all classes of the community in town and camp; but as the townspeople have been called upon to bear, what they consider an undue portion of the ex- pense, the consideration of the matter has for the present been abandoned. 46. The jail at Shikarpur, the largest and finest in Sind, cannot be referred to except in terms of approval, and the orderly and excellent arrangement of everything in connection with it, speak well for its supervision and management. A great defect, however, is to be found in the buildings; the ventilation is very imperfect. Side windows exist a few feet from the ground, but in the cold whether these are carefully closed with cumblies and articles of clothing. One small window is situated high up at each end of every barrack, but as the length of these buildings exceeds 100 feet, the benefit derived from them is extremely partial. Small ventilators to shut and open at pleasure from the outside, placed at every 12 feet under the roof, would give a vertical impetus to the air inside, and ensure its circula- tion. The building formerly used as the hospital having been given up owing to its unsafe condition, and one of the barracks appropriated for the purpose, it would be very desirable that, at least in this one, the method of ventilation I have recommended should be sanctioned. 47. In the subsidiary jail at Bukkur, the only point I desire to draw your attention to, as one requiring modification, is in the matter of its conservancy. After witnessing the thoroughly scientific and excellent arrangements in this respect as carried out in the jails at Haidarabad and Shikarpur, the method followed in the one at Bukkur presents an unfavourable contrast. This consists of digging trenches in the ground not very far from the barracks of a couple of feet in depth. These are resorted to by the prisoners, and every night some earth is thrown in until the whole is filled up. But this is the work of some few days, during which the nuisance continues. A latrine of suitable size should be constructed, and the system as pur- sued in the Shikarpur jail adopted. 48. The Umarkot jail requires more than a passing remark. As it is sadly deficient in the matter of sleeping accommodation, I must, to make this clear, go a little into details. There are four wards, each with a narrow door, and one small window situated in the op- posite wall. The cubic capacity of each of these is, in round numbers, 6,480 feet, which at the Government allowance of 648 cubic feet for every prisoner, afford space for only 10 persons; but two of these wards are reserved, one for females, the other for untried prisoners, and when not required for these purposes, they are used as general wards. On the morning of my visit, however, the female ward was untenanted, the other had but one occupant224 two wards first mentioned open into a court measuring some 60 feet by 24, at the extreme end of which is another ward open in front and used as the hospital; so that, practically, the sleeping accommodation for the prisoners, whose strength averaged for the past year 130, is limited when the two wards last described are un- available to the two other ones with the adjoining court, a small cook-room situated at one side of it, and the covered space or verandah, as it may be called, of the ward used as the hospital. In warm weather, doubtless, the greatest number of the prisoners are glad to sleep in the open court; but during the cold season, when this is deserted, the atmosphere of the densely crowded wards, cook- room, and hospital, for this also will be packed, must be highly poisonous, and cannot fail to act most injuriously, especially upon the patients. There can be no question that the accommodation for the prisoners should be largely increased, and not one of them, ex- cept as patients, should be allowed to sleep in the hospital verandah, which is, in fact, a part of the hospital; but under existing arrange- ments, as the two wards and the hospital have the courtk in common, there is no means of preventing this. I would recommend that a new hospital be built, to which the prisoners could not obtain access as they now do every night, and the present hospital converted into an additional ward for general use. This measures 25 feet by 24, and is 15 feet high, and would therefore hold 14 more; but even with this addition, unless the greatest number of the prisoners slept all the year round in the open court, the accommodation would still be totally insufficient for the average strength. 49. In commenting upon the principal jails in the province, the one situated on the Narra must not be overlooked. This one is quite exceptional in its character, both as regards the entire absence of any building, and the prisoners being all engaged in out-door work. The nature of the operations in which the men are en- gaged, that of digging canals and erecting bunds, necessitate their being moved about in the Narra District. The accommodation re- quired for them therefore is of a temporary description, and consists of pendals rudely constructed of jungle timber and covered with reeds and coarse tatties. Although the climate of these districts is charac- terized by extreme severity, being in the hot season intensely hot, the thermometer indicating often 120° in the shade, and in the winter months frequently sinking below the freezing point, yet the accom- modation thus provided seems to be sufficiently good for the class of prisoners who make use of it, seeing these are chiefly from the agricul- tural and shepherd tribes, who are accustomed to live much in the open air while tending their cattle and seeking fresh pastures. Their labour, which is of course entirely out of door, is not severe, but it is daily and regular; their food is good, both in respect to quality and quantity, and contains every constituent that is physiologically requisite for nourishment and maintaining the prisoners in good health. The clothing supplied them is likewise sufficient, and the material suited to the seasons of the year; cleanliness and sanitary arrangements also have not been neglected. Taking into considera-
225 tion, therefore, the peculiar circumstances under which this jail is maintained, the vicissitudes of climate and the description of dwell- ings the prisoners live in, it is satisfactory to find that their health has been remarkably good, and the mortality, compared with preced- ing years, considerably less. Indeed, the ratio per cent. of deaths to strength226 was in this state at the time of my visit, 5 P.M., what must its condition have been by morning. A couple of barred windows, high up in each ward, while in no way interfering with the safe custody of the prisoners, would remedy this evil, and materially add to their health. It appears somewhat strange that an obvious and important matter like this, and one, moreover, which could be effected at such a trifling cost, should have been overlooked and allowed thus to con- tinue year after year. 54. Not having travelled previously through Sind, I cannot say what progress has been made during the past year in sanitation. This is a subject new to the native mind, and it will take years of persuasion and patient labour before the people will be brought to value the blessings of pure air, pure water, and cleanliness in their persons, dwellings, and surroundings, and be induced spontaneously to second the effects of Government to carry out the measures best suited to these ends. Although most of the towns present to the casual observer a neat and often trim appearance so long as the principal thoroughfares alone are traversed, yet a very little deviation from these affords evidence to more senses than one that cleanliness is a term little understood, and still less appreciated, by the inhabitants of Sind. Upon inquiry, however, I was glad to find that they were not given up entirely to the evil consequences which more or less attend a persistent neglect of the ordinary decencies of life, and which charac- terize more civilized people. In every town I learnt that the munici- pal and local bodies entertained a certain number of sweepers to carry away the refuse and night-soil to a distance, and dispose of these after a manner which in almost all cases might be considerably improved upon. In some few instances the former were burnt, but, as a rule, the sweepings and refuse were employed to fill up hollows or were scattered on the surface, while the latter was merely thrown upon the ground in some waste or unfrequented spot; although I should mention that, at one or two places, I was informed the night-soil was buried, but even here this was done in a superficial or inefficient manner. Indifference, ignorance, indolence, expense, and long con- firmed habit are doubtless formidable impediments in the way of establishing thorough sanitation; but until these are overcome, unemptied cess-pools and putrifying dung heaps will be found adjoin- ing almost every house, and the people themselves will continue, as at present, to resort to the roofs of their houses and to ruined tene- ments for the purposes of nature in spite of public latrines, and the desultory and spasmodic efforts of municipal sweepers. In the mean- time, however, whatever amount of refuse and filth can be obtained through the agency of these persons, should in the case of the former be burnt and the latter ought invariably to be buried, not in one large pit where it soon becomes a foul seething mass, from which is born typhoid fever and other diseases of the zymotic type; but in long, narrow trenches, not less than 2 feet deep, one or more of which should be daily dug according to the requirements of the town, the night-soil placed along the bottom, and then the earth-filled in and well rammed down.
227 55. While on the subject of sanitation, I must request your attention to a matter of a totally different character, but one which nevertheless exercises a distinct bearing upon the health of the community who are subjected to its influence228 56. The above remarks, though written with special reference to the station of Jacobabad, are equally applicable to all other places where, as is observable at Tarusha, Mehur, and partially so at Larkhana, vegetation has been allowed to run riot and to exceed the bounds dictated by prudence and a due concern for the health of the community. 57. At the zillah towns vaccinators have been kept up by the municipalities, and are attached to the civil hospitals, where their work is supervised by the civil surgeons. This has answered well, and as many as 7,826 cases of primary vaccination have been per- formed at these hospitals during the past year. I was sorry to find, however, when inspecting the hospital at Kotri, that the Munici- pality had lately discontinued their vaccinator on account of the expense. In a place like Kotri, through which so many people are constantly passing and repassing, this is greathy to be regretted, and I would trust the Municipality may be called upon to reconsider the matter. 58. Vaccination likewise is practised at the several dispensaries throughout the country, but I regret being obliged to record that not much has been accomplished in this direction. Three of these have made no returns, and excluding the ones at Kurrachee, Shikar- pur, and Sakkhar, which are under municipalities, I observe that the total of operations amounts to only 1,977 cases. Various rea- sons are put forward to account for the meagreness of their returns, the principal one being the extreme unwillingness of the people, first of all to produce their children, and secondly, to allow of lymph being taken from their children229 59. It now only remains for me to make a few observations on the new Lunatic Asylum at Giddu-ka-Tanda, and on the first occasion of reporting upon this institution since its occupation, it is necessary to give a short account of the buildings in which the inmates are located. This naturally divides itself into two heads230 and but small acquaintance with native villages is necessary to understand the noise, especially at some seasons, which will find its way from here into the asylum. Then, again, there is its north- ern boundary, i.e., a public road, the greatest thoroughfare probably near Haidarabad, along which traffic and passengers to and from the ferry are constantly passing. Lunatics, as is well known, are utter- ly lost to all sense of decency, and thus become extremely filthy and demoralised in their habits; but even were this not the case, surely in 18 acres of ground some spot more distant than a few yards from this road, might have been found equally suitable for the erection of two of the largest privies required for the use of the asylum ! Although this question of decency does not exactly affect the lunatics, yet some might say that the public who use this road, and particularly the European portion of it, have a right to protest against their feelings being thus needlessly outraged, as they must be every time they pass the asylum. 64. The second and by far the most serious objection, that is as concerns the health of the lunatics and others residing on the premises, is the malaria to which they are exposed for nearly six months of every year. On the Indus subsiding there is left an extensive surface on both banks, with its burden of organic matter which speedily becomes decomposed under a hot October sun, and then on the other side, between the asylum and the fort, there is the large extent of marsh generating abundant malaria as it slowly dries up, and being carried towards the asylum by the wind which at that season sets towards it. 65. With regard to the first named objection a good deal might be done to mitigate the evils I have described. The village Giddu, it is true, cannot be removed, but special Police regulations might be enforced to control noise, and to direct marriage and other festivities to be celebrated outside or at the farthest end of the town. A wall all round the grounds I do not think at all necessary, but even if it were proposed to remove the privies, which is not, I believe, contemplated, I would strongly recommend a wall not less than 8 feet high being built on this side between the asylum and the public road, carried on its north-west corner, and even continued for a few yards on the west side, so as to exclude, as much as possible, all distracting elements arising from the village and people outside, and at the same time hide much that is most offensive to the public passing by. 66. The last objection which I have raised against the site, viz., its insalubrity from the large amount of malaria flowing towards it, especially from the east, is not so easily dealt with, and must always remain, in greater or less degree, an evil whose injurious effects will be painfully apparent. The only plan which promises to be of any avail in lessening this is to plant successive rows of thick-growing trees all along the east side of the ground, which, as has been proved, will act as a screen, and intercept a considerable amount of malaria which otherwise would pass over the asylum.
231 67. Previous to the present ground being finally decided on, I understand that another piece was offered for the consideration of the committee. I went to see it. The site is on the new Foolaili; on both banks there is a large tract of land, either of which might have been obtained for the purpose had the decision of the committee favoured either the one side or other, the following requisites would have been secured:232 examined the style and construction of many of its buildings as designed by Government, municipalities, private individuals, and Natives, and which have been constructed for the double purpose of excluding the heat in summer and the cold in winter. But when I look at these barracks, I cannot help feeling that, had they been purposely designed to catch and retain the heat during the day, and admit the cold and draughts at night, there would be no room for complaint that they had not fulfilled their purpose to the utmost. 73. Such buildings may be found to answer in a more equable climate than Sind, Kurrachee excepted, and where a considerable amount of humidity in the atmosphere is more or less present; but in a country like this, where in the cold weather the thermometer sometimes sinks below the freezing point, and in the hot rises in the sun233 than this, they use one of the two privies which are close to each other. I need hardly say I consider this to be in every way a most objectionable arrangement, and would strongly recommend an addi- tional matron being entertained, and the women at once removed to their own proper quarters. Indeed, so faulty is the present system, that they are handed over to the care of one of the male warders during the temporary absence of the matron. 77. The building which is termed a 234 81. There are 3 large sheds for the lunatics to work in, or to go under for exercise in wet weather. Two of these are alike, measuring 75 feet by 20 in breadth. The other is smaller, being only 35 feet long, the breadth being the same as that of the other. The posts supporting the roof are again needlessly high, being 10 feet; and, moreover, the sides are quite open all round, the consequence of which is that people inside have no protection, either from the sun, which is inside the sheds nearly all day, or from the hot wind and dust, which for some months are prevalent, or, again,from the cold east winds in winter; all these evils might be remedied by running up a wall on the north and east sides, and throwing out an open veran- dah on the other two sides. 82. The padded cells, of which there are 3, require considerable alterations to render them really of use. In their present condition they are quite unsuited for the confinement of violent and dangerous lunatics. The padding and its covering reaches only 5 feet from the ground, and the whole is so flimsy and badly put together that even a lad could pull the entire padding to pieces in a few minutes. There is, moreover, communicating with each cell a small privy, which is quite devoid of padding, so that, even were that of the cell itself in- capable of being removed or destroyed, a lunatic bent on injuring himself could effectually do so on the walls of the privy. Besides, as has been pertinently remarked, if a lunatic is supposed to be sane enough to go into a privy of his own accord for a natural purpose, he is evidently not violent enough to be shut up in a padded cell; hence the privy is as much out of place attached to a cell of this des- cription as is the lunatic in the cell under circumstances which sup- pose him to require one. 83. There is great room for improvement in the matter of the conservancy as existing at present in the asylum. Six privies are not required. Three would be quite sufficient. Another sweeper also should be entertained, as there is but one male and one female sweeper to look after the conservancy of the whole establishment, and the system of disposing of the night-soil, as is so admirably carried out in the Haidarabad jail, should be adopted, i.e., burying it daily in small trenches at a convenient distance from the asylum. Ample experience has proved that by this plan all nuisance is obviated, and the best of all manures without labour or cost thus prepared. 84. The water, as I have .previously observed, is of good quality and abundant. It is derived from 4 wells, but as yet no efficient means exsist for bringing it to the surface. It would be very desir- able that, whatever means are adopted for obtaining this end, provision also should be made for covering over, as much as possible, the mouths of the wells, as an open yawning well is a great temp- tation to some lunatics in certain moods to precipitate themselves or others into it. 85. There have been no arrangements provided for the lunatics bathing themselves; and it is most essential that for this class of persons, who are proverbially dirty and filthy in their habits, suitable
235 acccommodation in this respect should be afforded without delay. Hot and cold shower baths have been proposed, but as these are expensive to erect and keep in order, it would, I think, be sufficient in the meantime to have a small tank partly hid by a screen, con- structed near one of the wells, which could be filled and emptied as often as might be considered necessary. 86. Considering the extent of the ground and the number of buildings spread over it, the present establishment of warders, which consists of one 1st class, two 2nd class, and four 3rd class attendants, and one female keepeer, is, I think, totally inadequate to maintain any- thing like discipline and order among 100 lunatics, 12 of whom are criminal, and 18 more or less violent and dangerous. And even when the other two wards recommended to be built in the empty walled enclosure are ready, the number of persons capable of exer- cising supervision, will not then be sufficient. 87. Having now made all the observations which, in the dis- charge of my public duty, I think is required of me, with reference to the situation of the new institution at Giddu-ka-Tanda, and the description and style of the various buildings which give it the name, after its benevolent founder, of the 236 COPY. No. 679 OF 1872. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. FROM COLONEL SIR W. L. MEREWETHER, K.C.S.I., & C.B., Commissioner in Sind; To THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITALS, Sind District, Kurrachee. Commissioner237 7. Dr. Holmested238 have communicated your views concerning the periodical visits of Mr. Wright to Adam-ka-Tanda and other towns to the Collector of Haidarabad. I have no doubt that the Deputy Collector in charge of the division will do his best to induce the people to go to Alhyar, and that the Collector will gladly support the move; but for the present occasional visits to the other places seem unavoidable. The question of having a dispensary at Adam-ka-Tanda is well worthy of consideration. 14. I quite concur in your remarks as to the advisability of re- taining medical subordinates of the same rank as at present at Alhyar and Tatta. 15. The Collector of Shikarpur will be addressed with a view to a new dispensary being erected at Larkhana on a better site than at present. Your observations on the Sakkhar Dispensary will also be communicated to him. 16. The Jacobabad Dispensary is, as you remark, a very valuable institution. The construction of a new hospital with subsidiary and auxiliary building costing Rs. 10,000, has already been sanctioned, and will, it is hoped, be completed in the current year. This work was sanctioned by Government owing to the peculiar circumstances of the Sind. Frontier and the political advantages connected with the establishment of a hospital and dispensary at Jacobabad. I concur in the favourable opinion you have expressed of Dr. Behramji. 17. Turning to what you state concerning the Kurrachee jail, I have the honour to inform you that I consider the site altogether faulty. It is not only of necessity very damp, but after heavy rain the water remains close to the surface of the ground pressed up by percolation of sea water at spring tide; but a still greater objection is that the increasing town is rapidly crowding round it. Its removal to a higher and more open site is very desirable, and might, I be- lieve, easily be arranged, as the present site would command a good price. The matter is now receiving attention. 18. I have sent a copy of what you say concerning the water- supply in the Haidrabad jail, and the ventilation of that at Shikar- pur, to the Inspector General of Prisons, and I trust that your sug- gestions may be speedily carried out. I have also recommended the construction of a latrine for the Bukkur jail. The scheme for sup- plying Haidarabad with water from the Indus is, I may inform you, not abandoned, but is still under consideration. 19. Your remarks on the insufficiency of sleeping accommodation at the Umarkot jail I have read with great attention, and will see what can be done towards adding to the space in the building. I am glad to notice your opinion that the Narra jail is well suited tothe requirements of the prisoners, and that the medical officer shows so much zeal and ability. 20. Since you visited Sihwan the wall of the subordinate jail there has been pierced, and two windows let into it, but I will address the District Magistrate with a view to the number of openings being
239 still further increased. The Magistrate of Haidarabad will be re- quested to remedy the defect you noticed in the murderers240 26. As far as the buildings are concerned, I have the honour to inform you that upon the recommendation of the visitors, I have lately submitted propositions to Government for the improvement of the cook-rooms and work-shops, the erection of additional wards in the fort, the building of baths for the lunatics, and for a large increase to the number of warders. You observe that the walls of most of the buildings are too thin and admit the heat rapidly, but then it must be remembered they also allow the heat to escape rapidly, which thick cutcha walls do not admit of. Further, during part of June, and in July, August, and September, the monsoon breeze reaches these buildings and has a favourable effect in keeping them cool. 27. I agree with you in thinking that the sleeping blocks should be removed, and I will have it done. The faulty arrangements for the accommodation of female lunatics ought to be remedied. I will ask the Collector of Haidarabad to submit additional proposals to remedy this, and such other inconveniences as may not already have been provided for. The mouths of the wells ought certainly to be covered in. 28. In conclusion, I have to return my best thanks to you for your most interesting and thoroughly exhaustive report. I cordially join in the commendations you have passed on the several officers, most of whose excellent working I have had much pleasure in favourably noticing during my tour. I would beg you to return my thanks especially to Doctor Holmested and Honorary Assistant Sur- geon Leahy, whose successful labours and unwearying zeal have been so conspicuous. Mr. Apothecary Wright at Adam-ka-Tanda and the Apothecary at Tatta are also deserving of favourable mention. I have, &c., (Signed) W. L. MEREWETHER, Colonel, Commissioner in Sind. No. 737 OF 1872.

Administration Reports. No. 1202. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 3rd April 1873. Letter from the Inspector General, Indian Medical Department, No. 2775, dated 14th August 1872( 2 ) believed, lately been submitted by the present Superintendent, and will receive immediate attention. A state of affairs which allows almost all the liquid refuse that should be completely removed to soak into the soil underneath and but little ever to reach the outlets of the drains, some of which at the best only empty themselves into a swamp generally above high-water mark close to windward of the European wards, cannot but have a deleterious effect on the health of the inmates of the Asylum. The over-crowding also, still com- plained of notwithstanding recent additions made to the accom- modation, prevents that proper classification of patients necessary according to the most modern and improved methods of treatment and a more general employment of them in the pursuit of gardening, the great use of which is so abundantly shown in the Ahmedabad Asylum. Still His Excellency in. Council is of opinion that notwith- standing the admitted defects of the place more might be done in this direction than has hitherto been the case, and looks with confi- dence to the Superintendent's exerting himself to substitute pleasant little gardens for bare cleanly-swept yards. Government will not hesitate on proper representation to sanction any reasonable extra cost that may be necessary to carry out this very desirable improve- ment. Lunatic Asylum, Ahmedabad. 3. The number of patients under treatment was 116, of whom 15 were discharged, 12 were Transferred to friends, and 5 died. Much credit seems due to Dr. Wyllie for his careful supervision of this Asylum. The case of the deaf mute said to have been reported by the Visitors to be sane and fit to be discharged, should be specially reported on, with a view to his release. Sir Cowasjee Jehangeer's Asylum, Haidarabad. 4. The insanes from the old Larkhana Asylum were removed here in September 1871. The site is condemned by the Deputy Inspector General as insalubrious, but the Commissioner in Sind, in his review of Dr. Miller's report, does not concur with him, and observes that the site was specially selected by a committee as the best available, the propinquity of garden land being one of the reasons for its adoption. Various suggestions for the improvement of the Asylum made by Dr. Miller appear to have been fully con- sidered by Sir William Merewether, who has issued orders for carry- ing some of them out. The number of insanes treated was 136. The number of deaths was 18, and of these no less than 16 occurred at the New Asylum during the last seven months of the year, 10 of these being from dysentery and diarrh(3) Lunatic Asylum, Poona. 5. The number of patients was 76, of whom 14 were discharged as cured, and 2 died. The Superintendent complains of the difficulty of providing employment for his patients. If garden work could be provided as suggested by him, the results would no doubt be very beneficial. The Public Works Department should be requested to prepare an estimate of the alterations in the buildings recom- mended by the Superintendent, and to state whether the water supply, which is reported to be deficient, will be capable of im- provement when the new Kurrukwasla scheme for bringing water into Poona comes into operation. If so, there will probably be no difficulty in providing the garden recommended by the Superin- tendent. Lunatic Asylum, Dharwar. 6. The number of patients was 24, of whom 5 were discharged. No deaths occurred. 7. Here, as elsewhere, the insufficiency of the accommodation is complained of. Government will be prepared to take into consi- deration any well-considered plan for increasing it that may be sub- mitted accompanied by full statistics of the average number and class of patients. 8. On a review of the report on these Lunatic Asylums, Government cannot but recognise the necessity for a more compre- hensive treatment of the whole subiect of the confinement and treatment of the insane. In this report only five professed Lunatic Asylums, viz., those at Bombay, Ahmedabad, Haidarabad, Poona, and Dharwar, are dealt with, but all mention of the treatment of the numerous insane persons throughout the country under the care of Civil Surgeons either temporarily or permanently and the accom- modation provided for such cases has been omitted. The situation of the existing Asylums seems well calculated to facilitate the formation of Central Asylums on a larger scale for the reception of the insane from Bombay and the Concans, from Gujrat, from Sind, from the Deccan, and from the Southern Maratha Country and Canara respectively. His Excellency in Council will be glad to be favoured with the matured opinion of the Inspector General, Indian Medical Department, on the subject, containing statistical details such as those noted above, and suggestions for a complete scheme for Central Asylums to meet the wants of the whole Presi- dency. The Judicial and Revenue Departments, from the officers in which the majority of cases of insanity is probably received in the Asylums, should be addressed with a view to measures being, taken for a description of each case being as far as possible furnished to the medical authority to whose charge an insane person may be committed, containing all information procurable relative to the origin and causes of the malady.
( 4 ) Civil Hospitals and Dispensaries. 9. The total number of Civil Hospitals is 33 and of Dispensaries 121. The latter are classified as follows:( 5 ) diarrh( 6 ) and Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospitals in Bombay, which stand as follows:(7) 16. Dr. Johnstone, the Deputy Inspector General, Presidency Circle and Bombay Marine, has submitted very full reports regarding the several institutions within his charge pointing out such changes and improvements in them as he considers to be necessary. Copies of his report and of those of the other Deputy Inspectors General should be sent to the several district officers for consideration, in order that steps may be taken, where feasible, for the improve- ment of the Dispensaries. Government notice with much regret that the grant-in-aid rules are unpopular, and that in some instances a falling off in the number of patients is reported since the introduc- tion of the payment system. The effect of the new rules is to be carefully watched, and the results noted in the reports for the en- suing year. In the meanwhile it is the desire of Government, as they have before observed, that a very liberal latitude should be exercised, and that payment for medicines and advice should be taken only from those persons who are clearly in a position to afford it. 17. The remarks of the Deputy Inspectors General show that many of the Hospital Assistants and some of the Sub-Assistant Sur- geons in charge of Dispensaries do not give as much satisfaction as could be desired. The remedies suggested by Dr. Wright have the full approval of Government, and he has already been informed by this Department that in future the rule is to be strictly enforced, that no one shall be appointed to the post of Sub-Assistant Surgeon who has not passed out of the Grant Medical College in the First Class. The transfer of the officers who have been unfavourably reported on by the Deputy Inspectors seems very desirable, and should be carried out in whatever manner may seem best to Dr. Wright. As regards the training of Hospital Assistants, Government are not at present prepared to abolish the vernacular class in the Grant Medical College. 18. The proposals of the Inspector General for altering the system of store supply at the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital, for lighting the store room with gas and for adding a waiting room to the Male Dispensary, should be submitted separately to Government. As long as the question of building outhouses for the Ophthalmic Hospital remains unsettled, it would seem that there is no other course but to obtain diets from the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital. The alteration in the system of supply of medicine to the Ophthalmic Hospital, and the relieving the First Physician of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital of the charge of the Dead Stock of the Ophthal- mic Hospital, as recommended by the Deputy Inspector General, might be at once carried out. 19. In a recent report Dr. Wright noticed the inadequate sup- port given by the Bench of Justices to the Hospitals in the City of Bombay, and a copy of his remarks was sent to the Municipal Com- missioner for communication to the Bench. Government trust that the whole cost of the establishment of the new Goculdass Tejpall
(8) Hospital, with the exception of the pay of the Surgeon in charge, will be borne by the Municipality. 20. The Inspector General has not included in his report any general review of the proceedings of the Vaccination Department during the year, although very important changes have taken place in its constitution. The chief of these is the transfer of the cost of all Vaccinators from Provincial to Local Funds, and the appointment of an Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination to each District at the expense of the former, for the purpose, as stated by Dr. Turnbull, of itinerating throughout the year, inspecting the work and lymph of the Vaccinators, and thus ensuring better work and more reliable returns. The general result as far as expenditure is concerned has been an increase of Rs. 37,021 to Local and a decrease of Rs. 22,614 to Provincial Revenues. As the understanding on which Govern- ment assented to the change of system was that what might be saved in the cost of Vaccinators should be made available to pay for better local superintendence over their proceedings, any pro posal which the Superintendent General may think fit to submit for an increase in the staff of Superintendents of Circles not involving a greater expenditure than the sum saved will be favourably entertained. The year shows a satisfactory increase of 22,417 in the number of vaccinations, and the total number vaccinated, viz., 5,49,118, con- trasts most favourably with that of ten years ago, when it was only 244,792. The proportion of successful operations also, viz., 95.6 in primary vaccinations and 70.4 in re-vaccinations, leaves little to be desired in this respect. 21. The system of supervision of Vaccinators by Assistant Superintendents of Collectorates had not been in operation sufficiently long for any decided opinion to be formed of its practical efficiency. It is hoped the current year(9) thus save Government the labour of wading through large masses of correspondence, sent up without order and without any index of their contents, to find out what should be shown in a few paragraphs in the Inspector GeneralIP/13/MB.3 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRESS REPORTS OF THE INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY.

It is arranged in sections, each section with tables relating to it at the end. 3. The reports of Deputy Surgeons General, with tables, are also forwarded. 4. Government expressed a wish that this report should be pre- sented in a printed form, but the delay which would result, has in- duced me to send it in, in manuscript. 5. Notwithstanding the considerable delay that has already occurred, Ihave been unable to complete the Financial Statements of Dispensaries; those in Sind, which are wanting, will be forwarded with the least possible delay. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. WRIGHT, Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department.

VACCINATION. As the progress of the department during the year would be in- complete without some notice of vaccination, the following review is submitted, founded upon the report of the Superintendent General of Vaccination for 1872-73. 2. This is the first year in which the changes in the Vaccination Department, introduced in 1871-72, have been operative throughout the whole period, 12 months, and the results are satisfactory. Paid from Imperial Fund 2 ,, ,, Local ,, 201 ,, ,, Municipal ,, 43 ,, ,, Native States ,, 119 Total 356 3. There has been an increase in the number of vaccinators of 3 during the year, and the number em- ployed during the year and the Funds from which they have been paid are as noted marginally. Expenditure 72-73 Rs. 2,10,795 71-72 ,, 1,84,459 Rs. 26,336 4. There has been an increase in the expenditure over the pre- vious year of Rs. 26,336, principally due to the fact that the establishment was complete during the year but the total expenditure was within the sum sanctioned by Rs. 21,716. 5. The cost of each vaccination (6 annas, 8 pies) is somewhat high- er this year than in 1871-1872 when it was 6 annas and 1 pie.

22 Vaccinations in Bombay Presidency. Operations. 1872-73 588,357 1871-72 549,118 39,239 6.In the number of operations there has been an increase over the previous year of 39,239 as follows:23 15. It is quite hopeless at present to hope for the extinction of small-pox from our large towns and cities. 16. It is even possible that, with all the help to be obtained from legislation on the subject of vaccination, small-pox will still, in a city like Bombay open to all the world, number up its victims annu- ally. 17. But certainly, unless with the aid of legislation, our large towns and cities can never receive the amount of protection which they might receive easily to their own advantage, and to that of the communities having business relation and intercourse more or less frequent with them. 18. The report speaks favorably of municipal vaccination and of the progress of vaccination in Native States. 19. There has been an increase in dispensary vaccination of 3,636 operations over the previous year. Continued attention will be given to the subject in the hope that Sub-Assistant Surgeons as well as Apothecaries and Hospital Assistants in charge of Dispensaries will be able to influence and improve the character of dispensary vaccination and make it as far as possible an auxiliary, and it should be a very important one, to vaccination in the district surrounding the dispensary station. 20. The lymph in use is said to have been good; two supplies were received from England during the year, and this lymph did not prove so active as that received in the previous year. 21. Animal vaccination has been carried on in Bombay and Poona throughout the year, and in Sukkur during the cold weather. 22. In Bombay comparatively little use is made of other lymph, for out of a total of 14,940 operations in 12,666 cow lymph was used. 23. This lymph is certainly popular, and a great many of the ac- tive practitioners of Bombay consider it trustworthy. 24. Small-pox was very prevalent in Bombay during the year and was present also in a few of the districts. 25. Active measures have been taken in all cases, both for the care of the sick and their segregation and for the increased protection of the general population by vaccination. 26. I consider the work done and the general good conduct of vaccinators during the year, as well as the general working of the vaccination establishment, to reflect great credit on the Acting Super- intendent General of Vaccination, Dr. Turnbull, and his Staff.

The number of Europeans in the two jails at Bombay and Aden was 6 less during the past year than in the previous one; there were no deaths whilst there were two in 1871-187227 Karwar Jail. 10. The highest death-rate to treated 4.61 occurred in the Karwar Jail; but the Superintendent reports that the health of the prisoners has been very good during the year, and that, with the exception of one case of dysentery, all the fatal cases had contracted and been suffering from the diseases which caused death long before admission into jail; the mortality, therefore, is not attributable to causes exist- ing within the jail. 11. The diet, accommodation, and work enforced, are all condu- cive to the health of the prisoners. 12. At the Ratnagiri, Sawantwari, and Aden Jails there have been no deaths. Surat Jail. 13.

The mortality has been considerably less at this jail than in the previous year, as also the number of treated to strength, showing a considerable improvement in the general health of the prisoners. 59. There is nothing noticeable in the diseases treated, nor were there any particular symptoms to be ascribed to any of the various conditions in which the prisoners live. 60. There has been no epidemic. 61. The Superintendent reports that as a rule men leave the jail in better physical condition than when they entered it39 Shikarpur Jail. 69. There is a great improvement in the death-rate of this jail over the previous year; but a larger number of prisoners passed through the hospital during the past year than in 1871-72. 70. The ventilation has been considerably improved during the year at the recommendation of the Deputy Inspector General, Sind Circle. SECTION IV. POLICE. PRESIDENCY CIRCLE. Strength. Total treated.

The marginal table shows the number of admis- sions in each of these insti- tutions for the past and previous years, as well as the total realizations from fees. 24. There can be no doubt that the decline in attendance shown in the Veraumgaum, Prantej, and Sanand dispensaries is mainly due to the unpopularity of payment, as it has rallied consider- ably since the rule was discontinued. 25. At Dhunduka, although the fees recovered were insignificant in amount, the attendance actually increased over 1871-72. 26. This, however, was solely due to the personal character of the hospital assistant who has held charge since November, as contrasted with the disesteem in which his predecessor was held, payment being quite as much objected to at Dhunduka, as it is elsewhere. 27. No fees whatever were realized at Prantej, the Assistant stating in explanation that the rich only had been called upon but that they left rather than pay. 28.

Inspection of Dispensaries by Civil Surgeons.81 to the rules; and 3rd, that the hospital assistants in charge should all be men of sterling character and qualifications, then these rules, being founded on a just principle, might have been successfully introduced. And they certainly have tended to the advantage of some of the dis- pensaries financially; in the Presidency Circle, the sum of Rs. 872-10-9 having been received principally from the sale of medicines and from subscriptions. 51. But the experience of the year proves that generally all the three essentials above named have been wanting, and that, in fact, at all the dispensaries where the payment system has been introduced, there has been such a falling off in attendance, as to make it certain that the poor have lost the benefits which they were especially in- tended to retain, in much greater proportion than the funds of the dispensary have been improved by the fees of the well-to-do. 52. The principal points observable in the working of the pay- meat system in the Presidency Circle are the following, stated gener- ally:82 the dispensaries for 18 months, and of this sum the Deputy Surgeon General states that the major part was contributed by Government servants. 55. As it is desirable that dispensaries should not be hampered in their beneficient action by misunderstanding of any sort; and as these rules have been a fruitful source of misunderstanding, I would recom- mend that they be rescinded. 56. The question of the maintenance of dispensaries is now under report in the different circles; but, in anticipation of what may be ultimately decided upon, I would venture to suggest that the princi- ple of leaving these institutions, financially and generally, as much as possible in the hands of local bodies, who must be the most interested in their success, is the one which seems to hold out the most hopeful prospects, Government paying a fixed grant-in-aid. 57. Salaries of Hospital Assistants.83 60. There are many dispensaries which have been for several years in the charge of sub-assistant surgeons, instances may be cited at Poona, Ahmadabad, Karrachee, Surat, Nowsari, and others; and in the case of a vacancy occurring in any one of these, a sub-assistant surgeon is re-appointed. 61. In some instances there is an expressed wish on the part of the Dispensary Committee to have the services of a sub-assistant surgeon; and, if the population of the town or district and the finances of the dispensary justify such an appointment, the wish is always complied with. 62. Sub-assistant surgeons are not appointed to new dispensaries, unless their services are expressly asked for; but to old dispensaries they are appointed, when it has been the custom for years to have a sub-assistant surgeon in charge. 63. Apothecaries are never appointed to any but Government dis- pensaries. It has always been considered desirable that a few civil charges (their number is specified in G. G. O. No. 572, of 28th August 1871) should be filled by deserving warrant officers, as an encourage- ment to zeal and a reward for meritorious service. 64. The larger number of dispensaries are officered by hospital assistants, and the economy effected by employing men of this class, as compared with warrant officers or sub-assistant surgeons, is the principal ground of their selection. 65. None of the dispensaries have been used as training schools for boys or for females. Summary Statement of Patients treated in Dispensaries. In-patients. Out-patients.

There has been an in- crease in the expenditure of the past year of Rs. 577-13-9, there being also an increase in the num- ber of patients treated of 9,164, as compared with 1871-72. The income of the dispensaries is made up entirely of Government contributions and grants from Local Funds. In Sind no wealthy or prosperous individuals have yet come forward to help the dispensary move- ment. This is the more surprising as the province is extremely unhealthy, and nowhere is the bene- fit of dispensaries more plainly manifest. Government has been liberal everywhere in its contributions to dispen- saries, but in Sind it has given, so to say, with both hands to many of these institutions. In 1871-72, Government contributed about 70 per cent. of the total income, and Local Funds 30 per cent. In 1872-73, the figures were most unfavourable being 73.2 per cent. of Government and 26.7 per cent. of Local Funds. Provincial Funds(Government.)

117 PRELIMINARY. In the administration report of the Presidency Division, Medical Department (Civil), a few preliminary remarks appear necessary, to point out the additional means that have been afforded during the year 1872-73 for the alleviation of sickness amongst the people, by the establishment of new institutions, in the erection of new buildings to take the place of temporary arrangements, which, though useful, were unsuited to the purposes required, and in additions to existing hospitals, giving to them increased facilities for the treatment of disease. 2. Commencing with the presidency, an obstetric ward for the occupation of poor and respectable European and Eurasian women, was completed within the year. This will fulfil what has long, I believe, been felt as a great desideratum. 3. Two new wings, with their out-offices, have been added to the Lunatic Asylum at Colaba118 8. At Kelvi-Mahim, in the Tanna Collectorate, a dispensary, under the grant-in-aid rules, was opened in August 1872. It occupies the only house that could be obtained for the purpose, which was repaired and altered to suit the requirements of a dispensary, as far as it possibly could be made to do so. 9. At Sidapur, in the Kanara Collectorate, a dispensary has been sanctioned under the grant-in-aid rules. It is not yet opened. 10. Besides the above arrangements for the extension of medical aid, repairs and emendations of importance, to the care and comfort of the sick, have been carried out. 11. The present European General Hospital has benefited by various sanctions of Government. The wards for contagious diseases (small-pox, &c.,) have been rendered more secure. Punkahs have been entirely refitted, and now give comfort to the sick, the windows of the ward for females, on a side exposed to racket players, have been fitted with set venetians, supply of hot and cold water has been arranged for throughout the building, and the conversion of a part of the hospital into a ward for warrant officers of the marine and better class of Europeans has been sanctioned by Government, and a re-arrangement of the dispensary will be carried out. 12. In the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital the store-room has been supplied with gas119 17. At Roha-Ashtimie, in the Colaba Collectorate, a dispensary has been, I believe, proposed. 18.

The annual report of the Colaba Lunatic Asylum is written and submitted by Surgeon Niven, M.D., the Superintendent. This officer returned on the 20th March 1873. Surgeon Major Shepherd held the acting appointment during the absence of Dr. Niven on leave, but did not remain in charge until his return, being required to join an appointment at Aden. During the interval, several officers held temporary charge; these officers were Assistant Surgeon Weir, Surgeon G. Y. Hunter, and Surgeon Major Trestrail. Mr. Shepherd did not leave any memoranda behind, descriptive of his work during the year, nor did he forward any when called upon to do so; Surgeon Hunter left some remarks relative to various matters during the two months he held charge, these remarks are chiefly suggestions for changes which it is needless to enter upon here. The report is full and complete. The following is a short, general analysis of its
121 contents:122 the number rose to 226, remaining at the end of the year, with an average daily number of 223. The greatest number treated in One year was 313 in 1870, then 311 in 1859, and 308 in 1858, and the same in 1872-73. The greatest numbers cured were in 1857 and 1869. The greatest number of admissions was in the years 1855, 1856, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1868 and 1870, the least number in 1871-72. 7. I do not cite these statistics to show that the statements so often made are not without foundation, as to the necessity for new and increased accommodation for the insane of the country, concern- ing whose numbers, I fear, however, we are not able as yet to form a correct estimate, but to endeavour to modify somewhat the character for "overcrowding" which has been too freely given to the asylum. 8. There is no doubt that the sleeping arrangements of the asylum are not as they ought to be, and that the old building is rotten and worn out; the new wings are, I regret to say, badly arranged and ill-finished123 died; from 30 to 40, 8 males only recovered and 7 died; from 40 to 50, 30 recoveries and 5 deaths; in what, may, in India, be called old age from 50 to 60, 3 recovered and 2 died; and from 60 to 70, 3 died. 11. Table No. 9 shows the single, married, and widowed. No conclusions or inference can be drawn from the table alone. The next Table No. 10, gives an abstract of the causes of the state of mind for which persons were admitted during the year, the largest. number are "unascertained," 42; indulgence in Gunja caused the admission of 14; from the insanity produced by this 7 recovered. Intemperance led to 8 cases; 7 cured from this cause were dis- charged. Poverty, fever, and recurrence of the disease were the next most frequent causes. Moral causes do not appear to have given many admissions: grief 2, loss of money 2, religion 1. Ill- treatment is a cause, no admission from it took place, but one was discharged relieved. Under hereditary insanity one was admitted, two recovered. 12. Table No. 11 gives a combined abstract statement, for the year, of Europeans and natives. Regarding the former I will make reference to the tables concerning them subsequently, and regarding the latter, the foregoing remarks convey all the necessary informa- tion, except as regards the bodily sickness of the residents, of which Table 12 treats. Under general diseases A124 13. The medical statistics, amongst Europeans in the lunatic asylum are shown in tables; previous to referring to them, the fol- lowing remarks of Dr. Niven are worthy of notice:125 16. Table 2 gives statistics for 13 years and a broken period of 3 months; it shows that admissions have varied (11 the lowest number in 1864) from 24 in 1861 to 52 in 1872-73, while in 1871-72 there were 13. The total under treatment also varied from 42 in 1861 to 55 in 1872-73; and those sent to England from 22 in 1861 to 42 in 1872-73. The average daily number of European residents has never been so small as in 1872-73, when it was 5.15; in pre- vious years it has been as many as 21, 20, 19, 16; in 1861 it was 11, in 1865 the same, in 1870 it was 16, in 1871-72 it was 10.7. 17. For a short period each year the transport of military insanes may cause some trouble and difficulty, but such as are harmless, and the histories are sufficient to show this class, might easily be accom- modated, if necessary, in the Colaba sanitarium, I am not apprehen- sive of overcrowding. There were 4 discharged cured and transferred to their friends. Of these Table 6 shows the length of residence in the asylum of 3 to have been under 1 month and of 1 from 3 to 6 months. Table 9 shows that of the admissions, 43 males were single (3 cured, 38 re- moved), 6 males and 1 female married (1 male cured, 5 removed) 2 were widowers, these were removed. 18. The causes giving rise to mental affections, in the admissions of the year under report, are shown in table 10. 45 were "unascer- tainable," and may have been moral or physical126 and other sources, differs as shown in statement appendix:127 non-vaccination. The following results appear in the year under report from the two hospitals above mentioned:128 6. The acting first physician, in one portion of his report in- cludes the sick of the Cowasjee Jehangeer Ophthalmic Hospital: this is simply to show the number for which the stores of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital are required to provide. The vital statistics of the hospital do not include the sick of the Ophthalmic. 7. In the obstetric ward or hospital, of which Surgeon-Major Ward has the charge, there were 95 labour cases treated, concerning which that officer gives the following table:129 These results are accounted for by nearly all Christian women going voluntarily to the hospital for their accouchements, while other castes are only brought in when the cases are at the extremity that requires other interference than that obtainable from the persons they employ. A few indigent Hindoo women form an exception to this. It is almost useless to repeat the story of frightful mismanagement that occurs in the practice of native midwives. Dr. Ward's report should, I venture to think, be sent to the Medical and Physical Society, as illustrating some of the practice of this obstetric institution. 9. The returns of the Cowasjee Jehangeer Ophthalmic Hospital show a smaller number treated as in-patients than usual. This is accounted for by Dr. Maconachie not admitting, as was formerly the custom, persons suffering from slight or chronic ailments, or beggars affected with blindness. Dr. Maconachie also states that many operations are now performed on persons, as out-patients, who can continue to reside at their own homes, but who, until recently, were made inmates in the hospital. Byculla Schools. 10. The hospital of the Byculla Central Schools, the medical charge of which is held by Surgeon Major Partridge, has had in the year 292 boys and 187 girls as patients130 Surgeon-Major Partridge. "A large part of the body still remained more or less anæsthetic. In July last I stopped her oil (Bhow Dajee's) and began the oil of cashew-nut and alkaline treatment. I applied the oil to a limited portion of the body; and when the resulting blister was healed, I repeated the appli- cation to another part, until every part, where there was loss of sensibility, was completely restored, and continues so up to the present time." 9 months131 officers left memoranda. Surgeon Bruce assumed charge on the 8th December 1872. This officer's duties are considerable, as in his dis- trict almost altogether reside warrant officers and serjeants belonging to the Ordnance, Commissariat, Gun Carriage, Barrack Department, and Bombay Marine. Medicines for these are supplied from the European General Hospital, Dockyard Dispensary, and the Hospital of the Marine Battalion. 139 cases were treated. 42 officers were sent to England by the standing medical com- mittee, 8 went on leave to the Deccan or Matheran, 1 death occurred, in the case of Lieutenant Barnard, Barrack Master, at the Presidency. Women and children and many men are treated, the latter when not off duty, are not entered on the returns. 15. The third presidency surgeon, who holds medical charge of the Byculla Schools, Hospitals, the Jail and House of Correction, and Elphinstone College, has the same general duties to perform as those of the other presidency surgeons. During the year 1872-73, 82 civil and military officers have been on the sick list of the 3rd district. They were British officers 10; Indian, of Bengal Army, 14, ditto of the Bombay Army 26, ditto of the Madras Army 16. Civilians from Bengal 2; ditto from Bombay 3. Of the Ecclesiastical Department 1. Uncovenanted Service of Bengal 10. Most of these appeared before the standing medical committee. There is no record of the families of officers who come under treat- ment during residence in Bombay or passing through it. Elphinstone College. 16. Under Resolution of Government, No. 713, G. D., 13th March 1871, the sick of this educational institution are attended to by the presidency surgeon in whose district the college is. The students are resident and non-resident. Amongst the students many have been treated, some for long periods. No register has been kept by the surgeon, who, however, thinks that from time to time, about 17 students have required relief. Some of them over and over again. Many are delicate and weak, and overwork their powers in preparation for examinations. Several suffer from choroiditis. These cases are generally myopic. Great straining of the eyes at night produces congestion and increases the disease. These eye diseases are the only affections which seem to be brought on by study. A few cases of diarrh132 appears that 138 were inmates of the hospital during 1872-73, 3 remained from the previous year, and 125 were fresh admissions. Of these, 88 were discharged, 36 died, and 4 remained. The percentage of death is thus shown as 28 to treated. 18. Under general diseases, A, 38 cases were treated, 36 were of ague, contracted chiefly by persons employed at Tulsi, and 2 of small-pox; of these 28 were discharged and 9 died. Under B, there were 6 cases and 2 deaths133 The injuries received for treatment were confined to burns and scalds, fractures, contusions, and wounds, and numbered 56. No capital operations were performed in hospital. No alterations have been made in the hospital. The establishment was reported on favora- bly. At my inspection I regretted to be obliged to observe the extreme inattention displayed in the care of medicines, surgical instru- ments, and stores, generally. The civil surgeon's attention was particularly drawn to an alteration in the system of leaving everything to be looked after by the hospital assistant, and that the correctness of his hospital books he was responsible for. Karwar. 21. The very heavy fall of rain registered at thisplace in the monsoon of 1872, amounting to 135 inches134 The average daily number in hospital was 5. 24. Under general diseases, Division A, 7 cases only were treat- ed, and 4 of these were ague. In the dispensary report of this place the freedom from much fever is alluded to. Under B, 9 cases received treatment. Amongst these were rheumatism, syphilis, cases of leprosy, colloid, and lupus. Under local diseases, there were5 of the nervous system, two of which died135 Broach. 28. The civil hospital at this station has been under the medi- cal charge of three different medical officers during the year under re- port. From the 1st April to the 30th September, Assistant Sur- geon H. Cook, M.D., was the civil surgeon. This officer was allowed to exchange his appointment with Surgeon Johnston, who relieved Dr. Cook and was civil surgeon up to the 28th February 1873, when he went on furlough to Europe. From the 28th February till the end of the official year, Surgeon Lawrance has been Acting Civil Surgeon. Each officer has submitted a report for the period in charge. Dr. Cook states the mortality to be high, owing to the cases being either of hopeless injuries or of disease beyond remedy. The repairs of the hospital are still the subject of discussion as to who is to pay. Only one capital operation during the period was performed. Surgeon Johnston merely gives statements of treatment, and Surgeon Lawrance's remarks for the month of March terminates the report for the year. A few operations were performed by him, amongst which was amputation, and the reduction of a primarily undetected dislocation of the hip. 29. The total number of cases treated in the hospital of this busy city was 300 against 318 of the previous year, 20 remained, and 280 were fresh admissions. Of the total, 250 were discharged, 35 died, and 15 remained. Under general diseases, Division A, 70 were treated, of which 64 were ague. Under B, 29 cases received aid, nearly the half of these were from primary and secondary syphilis, the remainder rheumatisms and cachexia. Under local diseases, there were 5 of the nervous system and 6 of the intellect; of the eye and nose 3; of the heart and its membranes 3. Diseases of the respira- tory and digestive systems there were 65, chiefly chronic and acute bronchitis in the one, and dysentery, diarrh136 The condition of this hospital, when I visited Broach, was any- thing but satisfactory in regard to cleanliness and certain repairs; the stores, too, were kept in a state of disorder137 Under diseases of the cutaneous system 180 are shown as suffer- ing from ulcers. Aden ulcers, camelbites, dogbites, and human- bite have been entered under poisoned wounds. General and local injuries received were 73; amongst these were burns and scalds, asphyxia from drowning, concussion and compression of the brain, wounds, contusions, fractures, of the pelvis, ribs, forearm, leg, thigh, arm, skull, dislocation of the hip and elbow, &c. Twenty capital operations were performed. When I visited the hospital, Surgeon-Major James, M.D., had just returned and taken over charge from Assistant Surgeon Hay. I was glad to observe that preparations were being made for very necessary improvements in the flooring of the hospital by asphalt, by which its sanitary character would be greatly improved. In August 1872 the superintendence of the Medical Department at Aden was directed to be handed over to the Deputy Inspector General of Hospi- tals, Presidency Division, and in December the station was visited. The want of the records prevents me entering into the history and general arrangements of this hospital more fully. EUROPEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL.

The diseases from which most fatal cases occurred were, in their order of fatality,138 3. Thus, June and October show the maximum of mortality; September is next in order, then December, July, and February bracket together, as do August, November, and March; April, May, and January show only one death in each. 4. As compared with that of the preceding year, the most remarkable feature in the return, is the great increase of small-pox and of simple continued fever. Of the former 40 came under treat- ment139 Two cases of paraplegia proved fatal. One was the result of syphilitic taint in the system and one of accident. The fatal case of tetanus occurred as follows:140 16. Seven cases of Bright's disease were admitted. Of those, four proved fatal. Every year's additional experience convinces me of the error of advising patients, suffering from this class of disease, to reside in the tropics or in climates warm enough to prove relaxing. 17. Catarrh, displacements, and ulceration of the uterus, have been treated. One case which I have registered non-malignant tumour, although I have no doubt it will ultimately prove fatal, was treated in England, according to the patient's account, as cancer and the anterior lip of the os removed. When unattended to, it induces profuse menorrhagia and pain in left ovarian region, extend- ing down the corresponding limb, but yields readily to treatment so far as the urgent symptoms are concerned, and even the mass of the tumour becomes somewhat diminished. The posterior wall is that chiefly affected, and presents to my judgment more of the characteristics of fibrous tumour than of cancer, both as to signs and symptoms. 18. 103 cases of alcohol were treated141 Annual Report of the Jamsetjee JejeebhoyHospital for the year 1872-73.

The table given above exhibits the number of patients treated in this institution during the year. This with the sick of the ophthal- mic hospital gives a gross total of 6,637 in-patients, while those treat- ed in the dispensary amounted to 35,579. One thousand and fifteen died yielding a percentage of deaths to treated of 16.13. This is slightly in excess of last year, and is owing, I believe, to the fact that the number of in-door sick has been greater by an average of 47 per diem, and, consequently, the crowding has been more excessive. Con- stant attention, however, has been paid to the hygienic condition of the hospital, and if the percentage of deaths be the indication of its con- dition, it contrasts favourably with that of former years. In order to illustrate this and other points I have drawn out a table giving the results of the past five years. It will be remembered that in the latter part of 1869 increased ac- commodation was afforded by the addition of an upper story appro- priated as a surgical ward. 2. There has been, as evidenced in this table, a steadily increasing demand for admission into the hospital, and for treatment at the dispensaries, which is not due to increase of population and must therefore, I conclude, depend on a growing faith amongst the people in the efficacy of the European mode of treatment. 2,088 persons have been refused admission during the year, a fact which it is hoped will not repeat itself, in as much as the pressure will be relieved dur- ing the current year by the opening of the new native hospital on the Esplanade.
142 3. Reviewing the question of mortality more in detail, I find that the following diseases have afforded the greatest number of deaths in the succeeding order. Phthisis taken alone has the most unfortunate pre-eminence, giving 121 fatal cases, chronic dysentery 107, acute dysentery 74, diarrhæa 73, pneumonia 64, remittent fever 64, debility (?) 52, small-pox 37, intermittent fever 30, tetanus 25, and Bright's disease. 4. Taking the more prominent diseases treated during the year (generally in the order in which they occur in the annual return) I find that malarial fevers numbered 824; of these intermittent fever yielded 619 and remittent 205; the mortality in the former was 4.8 per cent while in the latter 31.2143 Diseases of the Nervous System included paralysis 17, hemiplegia 55, paraplegia 34, locomotor ataxie 8; percentage of deaths 14.

The number of cases of poisoning shown in the returns for 1872-73 are as follows:153 16. Opium.154 17. Datura.-29 cases were treated during the year under report, none died; in fact during the whole period of my connection with this hospital (nearly 20 years), I do not recollet a single death due to datura poisoning, although some cases are received in an almost apparently hopeless state, and are frequently 3 and 4 days under treatment. The drug is usually administered for purposes of theft from the person while in a state of unconciousness. The train of symptoms noted during the year as collected from the cases are, dryness of the throat, excitement, delirium, insensibility, dilatation of the pupils (sometimes lasting 2 or 3 days), catching at imaginary objects, picking at the bedclothes, extreme restlessness, giddiness (this symtom is complained of before they become insensible, and when they again recover conciousness), tenseness of the abdominal muscles, tympanites and incoherent murmuring. The pulse averages from 120 to 60, and the respiration averages from 15 to 28 in a minute. Persons suffering from the early effects of the drug are found by the Police wandering about the streets in a state of excite- ment, or dancing about the streets in a state of nudity, but are unable to give any coherent statement as to how they became so affected, and are sometimes objects of great merriment to the bystanders who crowd around them. It is a common practice to administer the drug in sweetmeats, seldom in food. 18. Arsenic.155 The treatment adopted for arsenic has been the same as used hitherto, viz., two drachms doses of the freshly prepared hydrated peroxide of iron every 5 minutes, wheaten flour, milk,and water given frequent- ly, ice, and sinapisms to the epigastrium and calves of the legs in severe cases, and stimulants if prostration is imminent. 19. Cannabis.156 symptoms of poisoning presented themselves alike in each case an hour afterwards, and were at first so severe that the Police took charge of the cases, under the impression that arsenic had been used to poison the whole of them; they were not brought to the hospital until 14 hours afterwards157 27. Tetanus.158 Operations159 Operations160 Several operations have been performed by the Surgeon in charge on native prisoners. The hospital of the jail is not a good one; it consists of a set of small cells apparently only for natives. On an upper story there are eight of these cells which are ill ventillated; they would hold, at a superficial space of 90 feet per man, 10 sick; but as two men are never allowed to occupy one cell, the accommodation in each must be given to one, who would have more than the requisite space, or to three who would have too little. Should infectious disease find admittance there is no ward for the treatment of cases. I look upon the hospital arrangements as very defective and requiring amend- ment. The general health of the prisoners has been good; the labor is carried on under cover; the cleanliness of the jail and hospital is carefully attended to, and there has been no overcrowding allowed. House of Correction. 2. The average strength in this jail during the year was 85 Euro- pean males and 209 native males161 followed. There were only two of disease of the skin. Injuries were infrequent; there were five operations; two tumours were removed and three of iridectomy performed. Surat. 3. The average strength of the prisoners was 193, males 183, females 10, 10 remained in hospital from the previous year, and 265 were fresh admissions=275; showing a decrease of 55 compared with 1871-72. Average daily number of sick was 8.1162 Parsee, and Chinaman, 24 Burmese, and 6 other castes, Under general diseases, Division A, 186 cases of ague were treated, In Division B there were rheumatism, syphilitic disease, and scurvy, Of local diseases the chief were bronchitis, dysentery, diarrh163 Under general diseases, Division A, there were forty-five treated, forty-three of which were ague, one case of small-pox and one of remittent fever. Of diseases under B, there were chiefly rheu- matisms of kinds, syphilitic diseases, scurvy, and general dropsy. Local diseases were mostly those of the respiratory, digestive, and cutaneous systems. Of the latter, sixteen were ulcers and thirteen boils; there were two cases of snakebite, both discharged. Of local injuries there were five164 Aden. 10. The average strength of the prisoners in the Aden Jail was Europeans two males, natives eighty-three males, and native females 7=92, being twenty less than in the previous year. Of the sick there remained at the end of the year 1871-72, of Europeans one, admissions two, total three; these three were discharged165 Local diseases, bronchitis caused 8 cases, there were 11 of dysen- tery, diarrh166 From such outposts as Morbad, Dhanu, Karjat, &c., sick are, as a rule, sent in at once to head-quarters, as also all patients whose cases will be probably of some duration. The total treated was 582, there remained from the previous year 15, the admissions were 567; of this total 562 were discharged, 7 died, and 13 remained under treatment. Under general diseases, Division A, in the corps through- out the zillah, there were 375 cases, 361 of which were from ague, and 4 remittent fever, giving a percentage of the former to strength of 45.12, and to treated of 62.02. Under Division B, 24 were treated chiefly for rheumatism and syphilis. Of local diseases, 184 included mostly cases of dysentery, diarrh167 rheumatism chiefly. Of local diseases there were 128; these were mostly diseases of the eye, of the respiratory and digestive systems, of the cellular tissue, and cutaneous system, and a few cases of gonorrh168 Surat Police Crops. 6. The total strength of the police corps is stated to have been 537, the strength of the Surat portion being 290, the remainder being employed in the districts on outpost duty. In the civil hos- pital at Surat there were treated 224, and at the charitable dispen- saries sick were treated as follows:169 and at the two dispensaries 569 were treated, 15 remained from the year 1871-72, and 554 were new admissions; of these 555 were dis- charged, 536 to duty, 19 otherwise, 1 was transferred, 2 died, and 11 remained under treatment. Under general diseases, Division A, in the above hospital and dispensaries 234 cases were treated, 148 of which were ague, 70 of febricula, 4 remittent fever, 8 of small-pox (at Karwar), and 3 of chicken-pox. Of Division B there were 51 cases, 30 of these were of rheumatism, 11 of syphilitic disease; there were a few cases of scurvy an170 11. The ratio of treated to strength was 80.8, that of deaths to treated 1.39, and of deaths to strength 1.12. The police hospital is a ward of the civil hospital. Sawantwari Police Corps. 12. The strength of this corps is 461, the sick are all treated in the hospital at Wari. The total treated in the year was 147, there remained 5 at the end of 1871-72, and 142 were new admis- sions; 140 were discharged to duty or otherwise, 1 died, and 6 remained under treatment. The average daily number was 6.6. Under general diseases, Division A, 103 were treated, 73 of these were of ague, and the large number of 23 were of remittent fever, the rest 7 were small-pox, chicken-pox and measles. Of Division B, there were 14, of which 12 were cases of rheumatism, 1 of phthisis, and 1 of secondaries. Local diseases gave 22, they were chiefly eye diseases, catarrh, dysentery, and diarrh171 Dispensary In-patients. 1. The civil in-door practice of dispensaries in this division is com- posed of patients called "Police cases," that is, of injuries either accidental or those inflicted with homicidal intent or in quarrels; of sick172 Two only of these cases died, one from double pneumonia, one from laceration of brain, the remainder were discharged cured. Bhondi. 5. There is little room, and less convenience, for in-patients here, as the dispensary is only a house hired for the purpose, but nevertheless five cases were received and treated. Three of these were parturient females, all requiring operative treatment; the cases terminated favourably, the other two cases were of extensive wounds, occurring in "Katkerries," inhabitants of the hilly and jungly parts of the talooka; these also were discharged cured. Bassien. 6. This dispensary, opened on the 28th May 1872, at present has small accommodation for in-patients, and that, certainly, not attractive. During the period of its existence, only three patients have been admitted as internes. By and bye, however, if another place is procured for the dispensary, which, I trust, will soon be the case, I have every certainty that there will be many who will take advantage of the skill and energy of the present Sub-Assistant Surgeon. The cases admitted this year were one of remittent fever, one rupture of the large intestine, one gun-shot injury. The rupture occurred in a boy ten years old, who refusing to take some liquor from a person, was thrown down, and the abdomen pressed upon with the foot to make him drink; he died seven days after. The post-mortem examination revealed a rent in the c173 at this dispensary have not been of importance, and the report does not reflect any particular credit on the Sub-assistant Surgeon then in temporary charge. Of the numbers, 16 were cases of ague, one of which died, two of remittent fever; a case of chronic diar- h174 treated. In the case of fracture of thighs, the injury was self-inflict- ed; the man was accused (falsely) of robbery, and rather than re- main under the accusation determined to kill himself; climbing a mango tree he precipitated himself from it, both thighs were frac- tured, and other injuries were sustained; he made good progress un- der treatment and was discharged nearly well at his own request. This dispensary hospital appears very useful, and might, perhaps, in time, bear to be increased, as there is no medical institution within a considerable distance. Kalia Wadee175 one was cured and one remained; they were all indigent poor. Here, as at Bardoli, the hospital assistant is not likely to attract patients. Parak, near Surat. 15. This dispensary has good accommodation for in-patients176 absent. Some of the injuries admitted were somewhat severe; concussion of brain occurred to a railway hamal who fell from the top of a waggon, and some severe contusions were sustained. Kelvi-Mahim. 18. This dispensary, opened in August 1872, has very meagre accommodation for in-patients. The number of admissions was 19, and the treatment of these cases reflects much credit on the Sub-As- sistant Surgeon in charge. The cases were of long standing, an177 DISPENSARIES ATTACHED TO CIVIL HOSPITALS. The Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Dispensary for Males. 1. An analysis of the annual report, and of the return forwarded by the Acting First Physician, shows that of male patients 557 re- mained from the previous year and 20,163 were fresh admissions; 10,623 were Mussulmans, 8,204 Hindus, 1,096 native Christians, and 797 Parsees. There were 12,999 cured or relieved, 7,306 entered as absented or unknown178 Derangement of the digestive system occurred in 3,088 persons, a large number being treated for dysentery, diarrh179 Of the total there were 3,917 women and 6,296 children cured or relieved,1,699 women and 1,991 children absented or unknown. There were no deaths recorded180 Injuries received by children are, what might be expected, burns and scalds, wounds and contusions of the upper and lower extremi- ties. 8. I have thus divided the work of the dispensary of the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital, to show more clearly the diseases to which the sexes and children are most prone. The same sort of proportion, under treatment, of sexes and children runs through all dispensaries. In the two dispensaries the total treated was 35,220, of which 23,212 were cured or relieved, 10,996 absented or unknown. No deaths are recorded and 1,012 remained. There was a larger number treated by 1,570 than in the previous year. Ophthalmic Dispensary. 9. Patients suffering under diseases of the eye and its append- ages, of all classes, rich and poor, attend at this dispensary; and during the year, under report, the number has been unusually large. The report of Assistant Surgeon Maconachie, M.D., the Acting Ophthalmic Surgeon, gives a clear account of the successful working of the institution. The number of persons treated was 5,895, of which 5,781 were natives and 114 Europeans; this shows an increase of 254 over the previous year. Diseases of the conjunctiva gave the largest number treated, viz., 2,651, of which 2,502 were from granular conjunctivitis. There were Only 23 cases of purulent ophthalmia181 Diseases of the cornea and retina gave no less than 337 patients; these cases come chiefly under ophthalmic medicine, and are not so satisfactory as those treated by surgery; for instance, many of the diseases of the optic nerve were but symptoms of advanced disease of the brain, ending, probably, often in paralysis and death. On the ophthalmoscopes issued from the medical stores, Dr. Maconachie remarks that they are not by any means of first quality, and are liable to become easily damaged when used by a large number of students. There were 400 cases of disease of the lens and capsule. 11. The applicants for relief at this institution are of all countries 182 diseases; a case of t183 Under general diseases, Division A, 2,201 received medical aid; of these 2,000 had ague, giving a percentage to total treated of 33.26. 190 patients were treated for dengue. Under Division B, there were 345 cases, chiefly of rheumatism and syphilis; of the latter 87, amongst whom were 24 females. Local diseases were treated to the number of 3,230. Those of the eye, ear, respiratory system and digestive, were in considerable numbers. There were 40 cases of congestion of the spleen; this, coupled with the large number of ague cases, shows that the population must suffer much from the influence called malaria. Gonorrh184 Affections of the respiratory and digestive systems gave large numbers; in the latter order of disease there were no less than 2,367 of ascaris lumbricoides or intestinal round worms. 368 cases of cuta- neous disease were treated. There were 10 snakebites, 8 of which were cured and 2 absented. Injuries of the head and face gave 45 admissions, of which two were dislocations of the jaw, both in women; injuries of the upper and lower extremities gave 123185 7. At my inspection of this dispensary I regretted to observe the somewhat careless manner in which it was conducted. The surgeon in charge received instructions from me on the subject; this officer appeared to me to be in ill health, and had evidently left a great deal to the hospital assistant. The establishment of the civil hospital serves for the dispensary, extra expenditure, beyond medi- cines and a few petty supplies, is not therefore incurred. Karwar. 8. The out-patients receiving treatment at the Civil Hospital, Karwar, where the position almost precludes the attendance of many, numbered during the year 1,311, being less by 25 than in the previ- ous year. 14 remained from 1871-72 and 1,297 were fresh admissions; there were (636 Hindus, 172 Mussulmans, 444 Christians, 19 Parsees, and 40 other castes. 1,294 were discharged, cured or relieved, 2 absented, none died, and 15 remained under treatment. Under general diseases A, 500 persons received treatment, 496 of this number were for ague, giving a percentage of 30.96 to treated. Under Division B, 66 were chiefly rheumatism and syphilitic cases. Local diseases gave 745, amongst these were 94 of the res- piratory system, 373 of derangements of the stomach and bowels; 38 cases of gonorrh186 Under general diseases, Division A, there were 651 cases, of which 624 were fevers, giving 41.3 per cent. to treated187 Twenty-two cases of injuries were received, amongst which there was dislocation of the hip and of the shoulder188 There has been less fever treated during this year, but the propor- tion to other diseases was almost the same. 310 Government servants were treated. 14. Vaccination was fairly carried on at Alibagh, though a smaller number was vaccinated than in the previous year189 DISPENSARIES WHOLLY ENDOWED. KALIAWARI. Nausari. 1. At this endowed dispensary, near the populous Gaikowar city of Nausari, and at the British village of Kaliawari, 6,315 persons were treated during the year, being an increase on the previous year of 61. These were made up of 113 remained from the previous year and 6,202 fresh admissions; of the total number 5,874 were discharg- ed cured or relieved, 323 absented, 1 died, and 117 remained under treatment. The average daily attendance was 63.6. There were 2,903 Hindus, 2,639 Parsees, 772 Mussulmans, and 1 Christian190 2. The sub-assistant surgeon in medical charge is intelligent and attentive; but, as I said before, he lives at a considerable distance away, in the city of Nausari, where there is a charitable dispensary, kept up by Mr. Wadia, of which the sub-assistant Surgeon also has the charge. It is this that has enabled him to continue in medical charge of the Victoria Dispensary on reduced allowance, the endow- ment being insufficient to pay more than the services of a 3rd class sub-assistant surgeon, the present incumbent belonging to the 2nd class. I twice visited this dispensary in the year, and also visited Mr. Wadia's in Nausari, which appeared fairly conducted, and was very liberally supplied with medicines. DISPENSARIES PARTLY ENDOWED. Uran . 3. On the opposite or south side of the Bombay harbour, is reach- ed expeditiously by ferry steamer. Before arriving at the village of Uran, the road leads past a set of curious looking, disorderly erections which are the distilleries of the mhowra spirit, obtained from the flowers of the Bassia Latifolia, a tree which grows in great abundance in the Rajwara and Guzerat forests; it also is found in the Concans. The peculiar smell of tins distillation pervades the whole air of the place191 cases treated192 for remittent fever, enteric fever gave 18 cases, mumps 17. The ratio of ague cases to treated was 37.95. Fever most prevailed amongst Christian farmers, Hindu labourers, and others employed in field occupations. Amongst Mussulmans and women engaged in household work, fever of the intermittent character was much rarer. Quinine for this dispensary is supplied direct by Mr. Ardaseer Wadia. Under Division B, the cases, 484, were chiefly rheumatism and a few cases of syphilis and an193 cases were treated. Gonorrh194 The new dispensary is well situated, has good accommodation for a few in-patients. With a little re-arrangement of details and a few slight alterations, which have been suggested, and may, perhaps, be carried out, it will well fulfil all requirements. The attendance at this dispensary has, as I observed in a former report, been greater in daily attendance than relatively in numbers of fresh admissions. It is unlike most dispensaries in this respect, and the fact is difficult to account for, but will be the subject of enquiry at my next visit to Balsar. The average daily number of patients is put down at 136, while the total treated is 5,545, which number includes in-patients. Compared with dispensaries showing somewhat similar numbers treated, I find that the average attendance was195 8. It will be observed that dengue and cholera were treated at the dispensary, the former prevailed in epidemic form in May, June, and July. In August and September, cholera appeared in the town and neighbouring sea-coast villages; in September part of the town was flooded; after the subsidence intermittent fever prevailed to a great extent; the daily attendance at the dispensary being in conse- quence so much as 225. The sub-assistant surgeon in medical charge lives close to the dispensary, in a house provided by the municipality. As far as I could observe the routine duties as medi- cal officer are carried on satisfactorily, it would, however, be perhaps as well if a change was made. A native medical pupil is attached, who was reported on favour- ably. Parak. 9. It is several years since this dispensary was opened to the pub- lic, and since it was removed to the very excellent building it now occupies. The sub-assistant surgeon in charge, Mr. Dosabhoy Pestonjee, G.G.M.C., states that the most gratifying circumstance in connection with its year's history, is its increasing usefulness and the greater confidence and popularity with which it has been looked upon by the inhabitants, the total number of patients having been greater than at any time since its opening. I am glad to observe this, for it appeared to me very inconsistent that an institution of the kind, with a medical officer at its head, so well spoken of, should have had fewer patients than dispensaries of far less pretence. The total number of patients treated during 1872-73 amounted to 6,613196 Under B, of general diseases, rheumatism was common, and of syphilis197 Local Diseases.198 280 received aid, chiefly for rheumatism, syphilis, an199 324200 Injuries amounted to 128; they consisted of fractures, dislocations foreign bodies in passages, wounds and contusions201 The average daily sick did not amount to 1. DISPENSARIES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE GRANT-IN-AID RULES, SUBSE- QUENT TO 1867. Pen. 1. At the dispensary established at this apparently flourishing salt town of 6,514 inhabitants, there were 2,856 patients treated in the year, a very great decrease compared with the previous year, viz., 3,168; 2,327 of these were discharged cured,or relieved, 478 absented, 13 died, and 38 remained on the register; of these there were males 1,532, females 387, children 937. Hindus 2,574, Mussulmans, 223, other castes 53, Parsees 5, Christian 1; the above numbers include in-door sick. Under general diseases, Class A, 624 cases were treated; of these 611 were ague, giving a percentage to treated of 21.39. Of class B. 221 were attended. Local diseases gave 1,861 in which diseases of the respiratory system, of the eye and ear, of stomach and intestines (particularly round worm), and skin diseases were the most prominent. Of local injuries there were 87 treated, occurring from accident or caused by malice; these were chiefly fractures, dislocations, wounds, &c. There were two dislocations of the jaw; in one of these cases tie hospital assistant reports after unsuccessfully endeavour- ing to reduce the dislocation, secundum artem, he tried the Electro- Galvanic machine, when success followed his efforts. The surgical operations were generally of minor character, some, however, possessing a certain importance. Thirteen deaths are announced during the year; they were from ascites, abscess of the bladder, dysentery (6), intestinal obstruction, pneumonia, hypertrophy, and remittent fever. It is seldom that dispensary records show deaths, and few give any clue to the actual mortality amongst the patients; in this case were we to take the number as a ratio to treated in all diseases it would be 0.45. This dispensary, as stated in my last report, is badly placed in every respect; another house is under consideration for it, and will, probably, be arranged for before next year; the best change would of course be to a place built expressly for a dispensary; this it appears at present cannot be considered. The 2nd Class Hospital Assistant Hurree Row Powar under- stands his work fairly; the number of treated is however small and should be larger; the decrease is said to be duo to the payment system.
202 In Pen there is a municipality, but the town is not a clean one; the fish market or resort for selling fish, the meat market, the bye- streets are generally unsatisfactory. The tanks are foul from human and cattle bathing, washing of clothes, and the like; the water of these tanks is not used, as far as I could observe, for drinking pur- poses. 2. The water-supply becomes scanty during the hot season, wells, where there are any, ceasing to afford it; at this time water is brought from a distance for drinking purposes. Vaccination is not successfully practised in Pen. There were 53 cases only successfully operated on. Mandvi. 3. A place with a population of 4,256, and situated in a con- fessedly malarious district, has never had under treatment, at the dispensary established in the town, more than 512, in one month, patients; and the highest average daily attendance was in the month of June 1871 when it was 58. At this dispensary during the year under report there were 1,635 patients, being 2,430 less than in the preceding year. The decrease is ascribed to the payment system; it is not quite correctly so ascribed, but to the want of proper instructions being given by the civil authorities as to the scope and object of the system. The hospital assistant in medical charge (who was, as well as the native authorities, at the period of my visit in 1871, carefully instructed by me regarding it) has reported in the follow- ing words:203 Of general diseases B, 93 cases were treated, chiefly rheumatism and an204 Under B, there were 136, of which rheumatism, an205 Of the 4,174 there were remaining 80 from the previous year, and 4,094 were new admissions. Of these 3,212 were cured or relieved, 792 absented, 1 died, and 169 remained under treatment. There were 3,378 Hindus, 452 Mussulmans, 343 Parsees, and 1 Christian. In-door sick are included in the above. The average daily sick was 40206 The situation of Hansot and adjoining villages, lying within a short distance of the Nerbudda estuary, would have led me to sup- pose that much fever would prevail207 There were 1,937 males, 1,235 females, and 1,705 children under ten years. At the end of 1871-72 there remained forty-five cases and 4,832 were fresh admissions, 4,396 were cured or re- lieved, 403 absented, 1 died, and 77 remained; 2,629 of these were Parsees, 2,008 Hindus, 240 Mussulmans. The average daily sick was forty-four, in March it was fifty-two, equalling the average of the same months of the dispensary in the three years of its existence. In-patients are included in the above. The prevailing diseases treated at this dispensary were first in the class of general diseases A, 2,431 cases being treated, of these 2,324 were of ague, being 47.65 per cent. of the whole Of B, including rheumatism, syphilis, leprosy, 190 were treated. In local diseases those of the eye, ear, respiratory, digestive, cutaneous systems were the chief; there were of the stomach and bowels 693 cases, the chief of which were constipation, diarrh208 The dispensary when I visited it required some repairs209 The medical pupil appeared to be very inefficient. The result of my two years' observation is, that I consider the dispensary would be better managed if an assistant of more intelligence can be appointed. Anklesar. 12. At the dispensary of this place, with a population of about 10,000 persons, the average daily attendance has been only 11. There remained from last year sixteen and there were admitted 2,541, making a total of 2,557, which compared with the previous, year shows a decrease of 3,227. Out of the above number there were cured 2,478, absented 67, died none, and there remained 12: total 2,557. As regards castes or religions there were Hindus 1,217, Mussulmans 1,009, and Parsees 331. Under general diseases A, there were 1,258 treated, of which 1,226 were ague and 32 dengue, giving of the former a percentage of 48 to the total treated. The situation of Anklesar and neighbouring villages, may, in part, account for the prevalence of this disease during the season following the monsoon; much, however, is to be set against the town itself and its general foulness. Under B, 72 cases came under treatment, chiefly rheuma- tism, syphilitic affections, and an210 No explanation is afforded of the great falling off in attendance; it would appear to have had its origin in part with the introduc- tion of the payment system; from March the average attendance fell from 29 to 14, then to 9 and 7; in September it again rose to 26, and in March last was 23. The dispensary itself, when I visited it, was in fair order, but the Parsee in medical charge is not, I would repeat, the person to attract the poor for treatment. The dispensary is itself ill-placed and ill-arranged211 16.61 to all other diseases. There were also 106 persons treated for remittent fever; others for febricula, small-pox, chicken-pox, enteric, fever, and hooping-cough. The number of fever cases far from repre- sents the amount of the disease in the district; the people treat themselves and manage "to pull through on the instinctive under- standing that the disease wears itself out." The sub-assistant sur- geon states that quinine is badly borne by many, and that he is very often obliged to associate it with other medicines; for instance, the Tinospora Cordifolia, the "gulo" of the bazars, of the natural order menispermace212 Vaccination has been attended to with care213 maining; 1,459 were Hindus, 80 Mussuhmans, 3 Christians, and 3 other castes. 16b. Under general diseases A, 253 sought relief; of these 243 were from fevers, 183 being cases of ague. Fevers are not so prevalent as they used to be, and in the year under report the people appear to have been peculiarly free from it. Under B, there were 155, chiefly suffering from acute and chronic rheumatism; in this class no less than 30 cases of phthisis pulmonalis came under treatment, some of whom were benefited, others did not continue their attendance. Of local diseases there were 1,032 treated: nervous diseases, diseases of the eye and ear, of the respiratory and digestive systems, and of the cutaneous provided the largest number, the chief being bronchitis, dysentery, diarrh214 collector. One curious circumstance was told to me, namely, that these inoculators are in the habit of inoculating after the manner of vaccinating, on the outside of the arm: if this is true, it is probably to hide the fact of inoculation having been practised, and might ac- count for children having marks of small-pox and presumed vaccina- tion marks co-existing. 19. The dispensary accommodation is undoubtedly small, but this is a matter that cannot be helped at present; it has already done much good in the place, and I look confidently to the present incum- bent, Sub-assistant Surgeon Tribowandass Moteechundsha, L.M., be- coming very popular, as he is in every way qualified to receive the confidence of the sick. One native medical pupil is attached to the dispensary, there is no dead-house, a want greatly felt. Bassien. 20. The establishment of a dispensary at Bassien, under contem- plation for some time, was sanctioned by Government Resolution No. 3554, dated 1st December 1871, under the grant-in-aid rules. The dispensary was opened on the 28th May 1872, at first under the medical charge of a 2nd class hospital assistant who remained until 6th October, when the present incumbent, Sub-assistant Surgeon Vishram Ramjee Gholay, was appointed. For three months, when this sub-assistant surgeon was on leave, Sub-assistant Surgeon Bulwant Gopal Bhate held charge. The site of the place at present used for a dispensary is in the centre of the main street of Bassien, and forms part of what is called the Sircarwadee or offices of Government215 Under general diseases, Division A,720 patients were brought under treatment, of which 706 were for fevers, 655 being for ague, giving a percentage to total sick of 18.23. This percentage of ague treat- ed, would seem to indicate a less prevalence of the complaint than in many other places in the Tanna district. Under B, 353 received aid; of which 244 were for rheumatisms of kinds, 11 cases were of phthisis, 31 were of leprosy, 23 of an216 The establishment of a dispensary at this town has been thought of for years, and at last has become a fait accompli. It was sanctioned by Government in their Resolution No. 4011, dated 16th October 1872, in the General Department, under the grant-in- aid rules, its expenditure being thus provided for217 treated at the dispensary. Of injuries 35 were admitted, chiefly fractures, dislocations, wounds, contusions218 The intestinal parasite, the ascaris lumbricoides, prevails among the children under 10 years of age. Santonine is the stand-by; there were 400 cases of this disease. Diseases of the chest are not very common219 colic, and dyspepsia in the digestive system were frequent. Of go- norrh220 3. There remained 76 patients at the end of 1871-72, and, accord- ing to the return, the number of admissions was 1,960, making a total of 2,036; 14 or these were Christians and 2,022 Mussulmans221 rently, unworkable; the medicines were few but in good order. Mr. Jayakar appears to be well thought of, and is consulted largely by the moneyed classes, trading Hindus and Mussulmans, "Bunyas," and "Khojas." In the year 1872-73 there were treated at the civil surgeon's house 1,417 cases; of these seven remained from the previous year and 1,410 were fresh admissions. 1,248 were Mussul- mans, 96 Hindus, 71 Christians, 2 Parsees. There were cured or relieved 1,178, absented 208, died 9, remained 22. The average daily number of sick was 37. 6. Under general diseases, Division A, there were 437 treated; of which 398 were ague, 22 of remittent fever. Under Division B, 239 cases came for relief, chiefly for chronic rheumatism, an222 to exist, there will be no difficulty in applying the new rules to the dispensaries opened under the orders of August 1867. Every such stipulation, Government decided must be observed, until the found- ers or their representatives agree to the introduction of the new- system, and, consequently, the proposals were approved, that is, that the payment system should not be enforced in the old dispensaries. This Resolution of Government also approved of a fixed tariff for medicines, at the same time stating that the charges should be extreme- ly moderate. The charges recommended by Dr. Wright were 1½ anna for each pill or powder, and 3 annas for each ounce of fluid medicine, mixture, draught, liniment, or lotion. 3. In reply to a series of questions put by the Collector of Dharwar, Resolution No. 660, dated 9th February, was issued, in which Government resolved that the subscriptions of "one rupee and upwards" were to be annual, but that well-to-do non-subscribers will have to pay for medical advice, the fees not to belong to the medical officer in charge of the dispensary. Government servants were exempted from the rule of compulsory payment. 4. In Resolution. No. 1308, dated 20th March. 1872, Government decided that the fee for advice to a non-subscriber at a dispensary should be four annas, and on the 8th July 1872 Resolution No. 2834, General Department, was issued, which very clearly propounded the objects had in view in establishing the payment system, and laid down the scale for medicines at decreased, and certainly most reason- able rates for persons of the description required to pay. In para- graph 3 of this Resolution, Government also decided that any municipality or community, which, in addition to its fair share of contribution to a particular hospital or dispensary, undertakes to pay the entire cost of medicines, supplied by Government, may, if it thinks fit, authorize the gratuitous distribution of medicines to all persons applying; otherwise the regulations now promulgated should be enforced in all hospitals or dispensaries to which the new system applies, i. e., to those established after August 1867.

The payment system, thus arranged for, was commenced in the month of March 1872, in the marginally noted dispensaries in the Presidency Division of medical superintendence, and during my tour of inspection in the latter end of 1871 and beginning of 1872, I made it a distinct part of my duty, while at each place, to instruct each medical subordinate in charge, each mamlutdar, mahalkerry, or police fozdar, and such better class people as I could meet with, on the mean- ing of the rules and who should pay, and on leaving each dispensary I felt sure it was, so far, distinctly under-
223 stood, that not only the poor but also those in a better position but still not exactly well-to-do, were one and all to receive advice and medicine gratis. I also asked that the information should be imparted to all. 6. It appears now, with the light of the year's experience thrown on the subject, that the system was extremely distasteful to the well- to-do, more in some places than others, and the discontent of these persons quickly reflected itself upon the poor with whom they came in contact, who, listening to gossip, ignorant and unenquiring, easily believed that they also were required to pay for their medicines. It was not the cue of those interested in the matter to disabuse the poor of this idea, and hence, for a time, in some dispensaries, the number of admissions and attendance fell considerably. In addition to this the civil authorities in some places did not consider the system a correct one, their reasons I do not know. Further, I cannot help thinking the system was not popular with the medical subordinates in charge, as it, perhaps, a little interfered with their interests. 7. I tabulate the average daily sick at such dispensaries, as the payment rules were adopted in, for periods anterior to the system, and subsequent to it; I also tabulate the sick of dispensaries where medicine is given gratuitously. From these tables I am led to assume that admissions fell from want of clear, comprehensive, and sufficient- ly widespread instructions having been given; I am also led to this conclusion from the fact that when the Collector of Surat summarily put a stop to the system in certain dispensaries, he ordered the occurrence to be notified by "bhatake" over the places. It cannot, I think, be supposed that the falling off in attendance, which at first took place, was all amongst the well-to-do; for instance, it is hardly likely in a place like Bardoli, where the daily attendance fell from 23 to 5, that 18 were well-to-do, and that 5 represented the poor; nor can it be supposed that the poor sympathized with the rich and stay- ed away. Again, it is not likely at a place like Mandvi, where the daily attendance fell from 38 to 16, that 22 were well-to-do and 16 repre- sented the poor, Were such the case the conclusion to arrive at would be, that the utility of charitable dispensaries is chiefly expended on the families of the well-to-do in the towns in which they are located. 2nd. The tables I think show, notwithstanding the evident want of proper information, that gradually persons appeared to become acquainted with the real circumstances, and the attendance rose again. 3rd. The same tables point out that at dispensaries where the payment system is adopted, wherever there is a medical officer in whom confidence is placed, it is well attended, receives a moderate number of subscribers, and payment for medicines but few fees.
224 4th. In some of the dispensaries under the payment system the attendance is quite as much as at dispensaries where the gratuitous issue of medicines is carried out. 8. Out of the dispensaries in which the system was inaugurated, it has been permitted by Government that the gratuitous issue of medicines, to all persons applying, should be re-habiltated in 5, namely225 think, mainly depends on the medical officer who, if he is really efficient will be willingly consulted; if the contrary, patients will stay away; much again will rest upon the character of the people and the number of well-to-do in the vicinity of dispensaries. Parsees will willingly consult, and understand that they should pay; a Hindoo or a Mussulman will wait until sickness becomes severe before applying. I found, and this appears from the accounts to have been general, that subscribers frequently received their advice and medicine for their rupee; I also found in one dispensary that Bombay prescriptions were sent to be made up, and that seidlitz powders were occasionally sent for; this corrective being apparently known to some natives in the districts. 11. It is well known to me that sub-assistant surgeons and hos- pital assistants add to their pay by receiving fees from the well-to- do for visiting at their houses; this of course is quite correct. But I feel convinced that to people so visited medicines are sent from the dis- pensaries and are never paid for. From Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 are in this way made in the year. Should new rules be under preparation this fact should engage attention, and also that the advice fee at dis- pensaries should be, in my opinion, reduced. 12. There is one point more to touch upon, and that is, when a municipality or community resolves to pay the whole cost of bills for medicines, in addition to its fair share of the general expenditure of a dispensary, to enable it to declare a gratuitous issue to the well- to-do. 13. To show how this may affect a municipality or Government, I will suppose a case. A dispensary is established to which Govern- ment gives a grant-in-aid of Rs. 600 and the municipality Rs. 600; dissatisfied with the obligation of paying for their advice and medi- cines the municipality or community resolve that gratuitous issue of medicines shall be the rule, and, consequently, they pay the bill of English medicine; this bill amounts to Rs. 300, the total expenditure being, I will say, 900 Rs. The amount for medicine, generously paid by the municipality and deducted from the total, leaves 600 Rs. as the remaining expenditure, the half of which the Government will, I presume, pay as its fair share, the other moiety will have to be paid by the municipality, which will thus disburse Rs. 600, i.e., medicine 300, the remaining half 300. In this dispensary, had the payment system not been stopped, the muni- cipality or community would have paid Rs. 450 only, half of the Whole expenditure; Government would have paid the other half Rs. 450; the municipality or community would thus have saved
226 Rs. 150, and the dispensary would have been credited with the sums realized from the well-to-do. Would not the Rs. 150 thus paid in excess have been better expended in, perhaps, much needed improve- ments, than in shielding a few well-to-do from paying for that which every where else such persons are required to do, and which if they did, would not only give to the town the benefit of the sum alluded to, but also assist in decreasing the cost of the dispensary to all. 13a. It appears to me that dispensaries are, or should be, really instituted for the suffering poor of districts and towns, at the same time that the well-to-do should be allowed, conditionally, to take advantage of them; the mere fact of having these institutions placed within their reach, is a benefit of no ordinary description. After consideration of the subject, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the continuance of the payment system, for medical advice and medicines, cannot be considered as a hardship or a wrong, more especially as the receipts are allowed to be given to the dispen- sary. 14. I am under the impression that one object which the Govern- ment has always had in view in the gratuitous teaching, at great expense, a large number of youths in medical and surgical knowledge, was to enable them to practice, in time, amongst their countrymen, and gain a livelihood by so doing. This object must be defeated so long as a general gratuitous system of medical aid is afforded throughout the country; on the other hand if this gratuitous system can be applied only to those who are really unable to pay, and pay- ment is required from all others, a certain progress is made towards reaching the path which Government from the commencement has marked out. English practice and medicine are now Favourably known, and sought for by a great majority wherever they are available, and the publicity previously given to their utility, by wholesale gratuitous relief, is not now required; a custom of this kind, however, once implanted, is difficult to uproot, and as long as the well-to-do can procure their medical relief gratuitously, they will do so. 15. Medical advice and medicines gratuitously given become a charity, and like every other charity should be carefully watched, and surely be doled only to those, who from their poverty, and, their ailments may be considered as true claimants upon it.

248 GENERAL REVIEW. 1. In-door European sick.249 No cause is shown for this increase, but the statistics of the institution show that the mortality varies greatly year by year; thus, in 1858 when there were 309 treated there were 19 deaths250 Bombay Marine.251 continued fever in both years is considerable, but under this head in the return are placed febricula, which really constitutes a large amount, the greater part of which occurred in the children of the Byculla schools. In Division B, 191 were treated and one died, the greatest part of these were cases of rheumatism and syphilitic disease252 Treated. Death P.C. death to treated. Guinea-worm 39 1 . . . Ulcers 300 23 7.66 Of the skin 100 . . . . . . Other diseases 601 56 9.31 Debility 420 91 21.66 Poisons 277 14 . . . Snakebite 1 . . . . . . Injuries 79 69 . . . The ratio of deaths to treated in some of these important diseases here shown, it may be interesting to observe; at the same time it must be borne in mind that very many of them are brought for relief when the period for that has passed from the power of the physician. In-door treated in Charitable Dispensaries. 7. Charitable dispensaries admit a few patients in the year, they are chiefly police cases, accidents, &c. Under general diseases, Division A, 84 were treated with 17 deaths; of these 11 died from small-pox at Karwar, and malarial fevers which gave 47 had 3 deaths. Under B, there were 13 of syphilitic disease. Local diseases which numbered 173 with 23 deaths were chiefly dysentery; of which there were 20 with 10 deaths, and skin diseases There were 75 injuries with 4 deaths treated. There were few poison cases and few snakebites. In-door treated in Police Hospitals. 8. The police sick of the various taluk corps are treated either in hospital at head quarters or at the charitable dispensaries near to where the detachments are posted; from the latter there are now received monthly reports of the sick, and, consequently, a more correct view of the state of health is obtained; however, as many men annually are discharged, and possibly many of these in consequence of ailments, a perfectly correct statement cannot be assured253 In-door treated in the Bombay Marine. 9. The number treated in the marine was 668 and 3 deaths. Under general diseases, Division A, 162 cases received treatment,148 of these were cases of ague. B Division gave 76; of which 57 were of rheuma- tism254 general diseases, Division A, there were 310, the chief of which were fevers, 233 were malarial, 194 in Bombay255 Under general diseases, A, were 10,596, of which 10,285 were malarial fevers, yielding a ratio to total treated of 29.42. There were six cases of cholera, none traceable directly to any primary conta- gious influence. Under B, 2,939 were treated, rheumatism and syphilis chiefly; 1,996 of the former and 219 of the latter, mostly observed in Bandora, Kalian, Panwel, Bassein, and Bhondi. Under local diseases 22,481 received treatment; there is not much difference in the chief classes of disease attended to from those in Bombay; the percentage of malarial fevers is far greater, so also is that for diarrh256 Broach, the smallest number at Hansot. Division B gave 824 cases, the chief of which were rheumatism and syphilis, the latter chiefly observed at Broach and Elao. Local diseases gave 9,134; diseases of the lungs were 456; of the stomach and bowels in much the same proportion as in the Surat dispensaries. 62 spleen diseases giving a much smaller proportion to treated than in Tanna or Surat; in other diseases nothing calling for particular notice presents itself257 were ague, giving a percentage to treated of 24.12 less than in Tanna, Surat, and Broach. The dispensaries in this division do not, however, show the fevers of the higher parts of this col- lectorate, these will probably appear in the reports of Sirsi and others. There were thirteen cases of small-pox, the disease was, I believe, generally prevalent. Of Division B, 1,052 received treatment, chiefly rheumatism and syphilis; of the latter 135 cases were treated at Kamte. Local diseases were 9,434. Under this head 3,928 cases of other diseases of the class of stomach and bowels occurred258 would not be for long, it was considered advisable that none but very necessary changes should be suggested; understanding, however, that even if commenced in the present year, a new hospital would require four or even five years to build, I take it upon me to state that the comfort of the sick, many of whom contribute to their own main- tenance while in hospital, would be immensely improved by a few alterations and additions, which may indeed be almost looked upon as necessary to their proper treatment. Since last March frequent visits to the hospital have made me more alive to two great defects which exist259 through the middle of the ward, has resulted in decreased expendi- ture in the cost of punkah-pulling, fewer men being required on the duty. 5. The Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital has laboured under some very grave defects for a long time, namely, in the outbuildings, house surgeon's quarters, and dead-house. 6. The outbuildings or range of squalid huts for the hospital servants were last year again brought to notice, the result of the application was not successful260 allowed, and the report of a committee, held in 1865, was laid before Government. In the annual report of the hospital for 1864, Doctor Giraud wrote: "The extreme unhealthiness of the quarters of the apothecary and steward has been repeatedly brought to notice, and in 1857 new quarters were sanctioned by Government. I beg respectively to press upon the authorities the great injustice of compelling the apothecary and steward to reside in dwellings which from their site and construction are so seriously prejudicial to the healths of themselves and families." Doctor Haines in 1865 wrote: "In November last a committee was appointed to suggest measures for defects (these still exist) in the buildings of the hospital; the committee have drawn up their proceedings in which they recom- mend a place for a permanent block of buildings for the apothecary (now house surgeon) and assistant apothecaries has also been pre- pared." In 1867, Doctor Hunter adverted to the proceedings of 1865 and reported that no action had been taken in the matter, although strongly supported and recommended by the Inspector General, Indian Medical Department. The following is a portion of the pro- ceedings of the committee of 1865:261 the Duke of Edinburgh one of the wards262 18. The subject of dead-houses for the police purposes of the dis- tricts has been laid before Government. The need of such places does not require demonstration; and sub-assistant surgeons and hospital tssistants, where dispensaries are not supplied, are put to much dis- aress and inconvenience in consequence, and represent the circumstance in complaints that cannot be relieved. I have prepared a list of post- mortem examinations performed in the division at the instance of the Police, and in the cause of justice, to which I would beg reference, perhaps, no better repression of the crimes of murder, infanticide, &c., &c., exist than in the knowledge, that careful examinations are con- ducted; as dispensaries increase, and distances to places where these are made decrease, much more preventive good will arise. 19. Amongst the vernacular students the point of post-mortem appearances should be one of the most important features of their education; but as the instruction dead-house now is, there is too much crowding for the carrying out of the principal's wishes. 20. At Tanna the well water for drinking purposes has long been complained of, and samples of the water of eight wells in the police and military lines, have been sent in to the chemical analyser for report. This officer has already examined the well waters of the jail with regard to the Guineaworm. A well for the use of the hospi- tal is very necessary as the water has to be brought from the above mentioned wells, or from the private wells of gentlemen residing near. An entire rearrangement of latrines also is necessary, the present ones, I can well believe, being a public nuisance, reported on frequently by the civil surgeon. 21. Between the parsonage, occupied by the Chaplain of Christ's Church, Byculla, and the hospital of the Byculla Schools, there is a piece of low lying waste ground which in the monsoon is a swamp, and in the following months covered with coarse, rank, vegetation, evaporating under the heat of the sun; the place might, perhaps, be put to profitable use after filling in, instead of being, as it is now, a waste, prejudicial alike to the inmates of the parsonage, the hospital, and neighbouring residences. At Anklesar it would be advisable to change the locality of the dispensary. There is a Government buildingSTATEMENT.

There remained on the 31st March 1872 in the lunatic asylums of Poona and Dharwar 75 patients. The admissions since that date are 29; making the total number of lunatics treated during the past official year 104; of these 9 were discharged cured, 11 have died, leaving 84 patients still under treatment.

Report of Lunatics treated in the Civil Hospitals and Dispensaries in the Poona Division and Southern Maratha Circle for the year 1872-73. Accommodation for in- sanes at civil hospitals. The accommodation provided for insane patients at the civil hos- pitals has somewhat been improved since last report. At Dhúlía the lunatics were formerly treated in a small, badly ventilated ward or cell, miserably insufficient for the accommodation of the number of patients usually present. By the removal of the civil and police patients to the new hospital, ample room has been found for the insane in the comparatively spacious wards of the old civil hospital. The temporary asylum attached to the civil hospital at Belgaum was closed in the month of September last, and the patients trans- ferred to the lunatic asylum at Dharwar. This step was rendered necessary; for owing to defective accommodation and want of neces- sary appliances and establishment, little could be attempted with a view to the proper treatment of its inmates. As no provision has been made for the reception of lunatics at the civil hospital, it is hoped that, when patients of this class are sent by the civil authorities to Belgaum, arrangements will be made to transfer them without delay to the Dharwar Asylum. The asylum attached to the Kolhapur Civil Hospital has been recently built, and affords accommodation for 12 insanes. It is a stone building erected on the cell principle, and both in its design and internal arrangements, reflects credit on the Kolhapur State. No returns of this asylum have been received from the medical officer in charge, but on a recent inspection, 7 patients were found under treatment. The Satara Civil Hospital is now one of the few in which no adequate accommodation for lunatics has been provided. The small room in which they are at present treated is dark and badly ventilated, and adjoins the female ward, which, on sanitary and other grounds, is objectionable. At the close of the year 1871-72 there were 9 insanes still under treatment in the Belgaum and Dhúlía Hospitals. The admissions to hospital during the past year were 58, making a total of 67. Of these, 41 were discharged cured, 16 transferred to parent asylums, 1 died, and 9 remain.
294 Number treated and how disposed of. The following table will show the hos- pitals in which lunatics have been treated and the number and disposal of each patient in hospital:295 Dengue Fever.296 Diarrh297 the medical authorities and Government. By a Resolution No. 1014, dated 21st March 1873, the sum of Rs. 5,000 was granted for the purpose of making certain alterations and additions to the hospital. This outlay, however, has not been incurred; for the native regiment stationed at Dhúlía having been withdrawn, a great portion of the large military hospital has been given up to the civil department for the reception of civil patients and the sick of the Police and Poona Horse. The old civil hospital is now only used as a dispensary and for the accommodation of insanes. The only addition now required to make this hospital complete is public quarters for the hospital assistants, which probably will be sanctioned shortly. Sassoon General Hospital.298 Ahmadnagar.299 Sickness and morta- lity. The total number of persons treated during the past official year was 53,290; of these, 57 died. With a death-rate of only 1 per thousand, it must be supposed that very few of the cases treated were of a serious character, and further that the mortality recorded cannot be taken as an approxi- mation of actual results. Prevailing diseases. As regards the prevailing diseases, the present return exhibits no deviation from those received from other civil charges. Fevers and diseases of the stomach and intestines furnishing 43 per cent. of the total cases treated. Dysentery and diar- rh300 The average strength of the prisoners in the above jails during the year was as follows:301 taking up all the filth which had accumulated in them, was no doubt largely used with all its suspended impurities. Diseases of the Respiratory System.302 Jail accommodation insuf- ficient. Judging from the returns received from the several jails in this division, I think it is evident, that the pre- sent prison accommodation is on very much too limited a scale to meet the requirements of our convict population. Yerrowda Central Jail now contains 400 prisoners above its esti- mated capacity, and the total number of convicts in the jails for which no adequate provision has been made is 796. Annual Progress Report of Police Hospitals in the Poona Division for the year 1872-73. General health of the po- lice force. The returns received from the police hospitals for the past year, though on the whole favourable, considering the work the Police are called upon to per- form, are not so satisfactory as those sub- mitted for the preceding year, exhibiting as they do, with a large reduction of strength, a greater amount of sickness and mortality. Sickness and mortality. The average strength of the Police in this division during the year was 6,113. Of these 2,867 were treated in the hospitals and 30 died. The percentage, therefore, of sick to strength was 46.9 and deaths to treated 1 per cent. If the above statement is to be relied upon, it shows that the Police, as a body, have been very healthy during the year, notwith- standing the sickness which has been so general throughout the dis- tricts. But I am inclined to think that many instances occurred of policemen when sick being allowed to remain in their lines without medical treatment, and that some men even died at the out- posts, and, consequently, are not brought on the returns. Cholera.303 Diseases of the Stomach and Intestine.304 Defective state of police lines in North Kanara. The accommdatioon provided for the Police in Kanara jungles, as before mentioned, is, as a rule, very bad, and is one source of the great amount of sickness which has prevailed and still prevails amongst them. For, it may be observed, it is in these districts that the men of the Police require better shelter and more wholesome dwellings than in any other. At Supa and Sirsi the lines are good, but at Moondegod it was observed that the police quarter consisted of a house capable of containing, perhaps, a large family, but in which the whole detachment of some 40 men were located. No. 111/M OF 1873. FROM THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL, P. D. A., To THE SECRETARY TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, Indian Medical Department. Mahableshwar, 1st June 1873. General observations. SIR,305 The difference in cost of diets at different hos- pitals. In some civil hospitals the average cost of daily diets is one-third more than at others; and that, too, at sta- tions where the market prices of the articles in use are actually cheaper. In order to form a correct idea of the subject, a statement has been prepared (vide C I), showing the average price of each article dur- ing the past year, in the several collectorates, and the cost of diet- ing patients at the various civil hospitals in this Division. Causes of difference. Why this difference should exist I am unable to say306 rather expensive, it has been thought advisable to retain, as the sub- stitute for it307 in my opinion should be adopted with a view to check this undue expenditure. probable causes of increased expenditure. The causes which have led to this increase, I think, may be traced partly to expensive preparations now too much in use in hospitals when cheaper and as efficacious articles might be employed; and, also, to the undue accumulation of drugs in store, which, in course of time, deteriorate and are condemned. The expensive surgical instruments supplied by Government to charitable dispensaries on their first establishment, I am of opinion, are quite unnecessary. A few instruments of the simplest kind is all that hospital assistants need, and should sub-assistant surgeons at any time require more, they can be obtained from the civil hospital. 40 M D

310 The Administration Report of the Charitable Dispensaries in the Poona Division and Southern Maratha Circle for the year 1872-73. There are at present in the Poona Division and Southern Maratha Country thirty-four charitable dispensaries. General observations. Of these, eight have been opened since last report, and four only so recently established that they have not been incorporated in the general return submitted. Dispensaries how maintained. With exception of the three State dispensaries and four dispensa- ries in North Canara, which are still wholly supported by Government, these establishments are maintained jointly by Government and the munici- palities or local fund committees. The exact proportion paid by each, with all other financial details regarding them, will be explained in a separate statement appended to this report. Statistics. The general return submitted embraces the operations of thirty dispensaries, and shows that the total number of persons treated at these institutions during the past year was 73,438. Of these 61,113 were dis- charged cured, 10,755 absented, 336 died, and there remained attend- ing the dispensaries on the 31st March 1229. Statistical returns from dispensaries must of a necessity be very un- satisfactory, seeing that they fail to show the result of treatment of a large proportion of those resorting to them for medical advice. But this want of reliable information is not only to be found in dispensary returns in this country, but also in England and elsewhere. The most prevalent diseases during the year appear to have been fever and diseases of the stomach and bowels, comprising as they do 40 per cent. of the total treated. Epidemic cholera. Although epidemic cholera of fatal type is known to have prevailed to a great extent over the Deccan and Southern Maratha Circle, from April to Sep- tember 1872, returns from dispensaries only give 491 cases treated with 161 deaths, showing, I think, that medical aid must have been but scantily rendered by medical officers in charge, and that a propor- tion of the cases recorded were, probably, not cholera, with a death- rate of only 23 per cent. The three principal towns invaded by cholera in this Division, during the year 1870, were Pandharpur, Nasik, and Poona.
311 The normal season of its invasion or reproduction in these districts, is during the hot season and commencement of the rains, and last year was no exception to the rule; for at the end of March cholera was reported to have broken out at Pandharpur, at Nasik in May, and at Poona in June. The town of Pundharpur may be said to be never free from cholera. But it is in the months of April and July, or at the time when the principal juttras or fairs are held, that great outbreaks of cholera frequently occur, as exemplified in the history of the last epidemic. It was on the 23rd March, and very soon after the commencement of the Chytre fair, that cholera broke out amongst the pilgrims, and continued, with more or less severity, until the end of June when it abated, only, however, to break out with greater virulence on the occasion of the following and principal juttra, which took place in July and was prolonged until September, after which no further cases were reported. Although systematic sanitary efforts and arrangements for con- servancy have been adopted for some time past at Pundharpur, stil a good deal more requires to be done in order to bring the town to a proper sanitary condition. Sanitary condition of the town. Overcrowding and appar- ent results. The principal defects which at present exist are the want of a proper system of drainage and a plentiful supply of pure water. No doubt the town is cleaner than formerly, but the cleanli- ness and drainage, within dwellings and courts attached to them, are still very defective. During the period in which fairs are held the town receives an immense accession of population. On some occasions I am creditably informed that 40,000 people, over and above residents, are allowed to take up their abode within the walls of the town. Last year, owing to the presence of cholera, the attendance was comparatively thin, and only 25,000 had to be accommodated. This was considered so great a falling off, that the authorities did not consider it necessary that the dhurumshalla at Gopalpur should be occupied. The overcrowding, therefore, must have been very great, and the facilities which existed for fouling the air, the earth, and the water, must necessarily have been far greater than at any other time; and it is in this way, I believe, that cholera poison hitherto dormant is roused into activity, and is diffused amongst a population, the majority of whom, from previous fatigue, privation, and exposure are rendered peculiarly susceptible to its influ- ences.
312 I am not aware in how far the law would support a prohibitory order against overcrowding in lodging houses and other places resorted to by pilgrims; but I feel, confident that, so long as this state of things is permitted to exist, periodical outbreaks of cholera may be confidently expected. Sanitary arrangements at Pundharpur juttras satis- factory. Nothing can be more satisfactory than the sanitary and other arrangements usually made by the magis- trate and police authorities at the encamp- ing ground at Gopalpur, during the period these festivals are held. Pendalls, however, have yet to be built, and if erected to the extent at first contemplated by Government, viz., for 10,000 people, they will assist greatly to diminish the inordinate demand for accommodation within the town. It may here be mentioned that the recommendation made to Government by the Sanitary Commissioner and my predecessor, Dr. Pelly, in a report submitted in March 1871, to prevent overcrowd- ing at the approaches, and for securing better ventilation in Vittoba's temple, is now strictly enforced; but other proposals, such as a pro- per system of drainage and better and more complete conservancy arrangements, have yet to be carried out. Mortality from cholera in 1872-73. The total number of persons attacked by cholera from its first appearance in April till its cessation in November following was 488 and the deaths reported 159. No register appears to have been kept at the dispensary previous to 1870; and it is now submitted, for it indicates that cholera outbreaks, as before observed, usually occur at periods when these fairs take place.

313 Cholera at Nasik.314 plete system of drainage, to widen its narrow and filthy streets, to establish a better system of conservancy within dwelling houses and court yards attached, and to procure for its inhabitants a full supply of pure drinking water. Through the exertions of its energetic Collector, the sanitary con- dition of the town is improving; and if only the suggestions offered could be carried out, outbreaks of cholera would, I believe, be much less frequent than at present, if not altogether eradicated. Cholera in the Poona City.315 Dispensary Buildings.316 ber of patients treated at the 8 new dispensaries, the return shows a decrease in attendance of 6,000 persons. This falling off in at- tendance is, in a great measure, I think, attributable to the introduc- tion of the payment system which came into force in 1872. The manner in which the subordinate medical officers in charge of charitable dispensaries have conducted their duties is, on the whole, satisfactory, especially the sub-assistant surgeons and those hos- pital assistants who have had charge of a dispensary for any time. But, in order to keep them up to their work, and with a view of in- creasing the efficiency of these establishments, I think it is highly necessary they should be regularly inspected and reported on. Periodical Inspection of Dispensaries.317 All civil authorities with whom I have had an opportunity of con- sulting on this subject, concur in stating that the system is very unpopular and, in some parts of the country, it is looked upon in the light of a tax. In the first few months after it was introduced, the daily attend- ance, especially at dispensaries recently established, fell off very considerably; and it was only after it had been fully explained to the people, that from those persons who in the opinion of the municipal commissioners were able to pay would fees be demanded, that con- fidence was in some measure restored. Whilst fully admitting the principle that well-to-do persons should be made to pay for the benefits they may derive from a dispensary, yet the scheme is one so unpopular and, financially, has worked so badly, that I am inclined to recommend that paragraphs 20 and 22 of the new dispensary rules should be rescinded.

347 Annual Report of Civil, Jail, and Police Hospitals and Dispensaries in the Northern and Mhow Divisions for the Year ending 31st March 1873. Ahmadabad, 1st April 1873, 1. The very lengthened period, 11th November 1872 till 20th February 1873, in making myself thoroughly acquainted with the military wants and requirements (within the circuits of the principal portion Northern and entire Mhow Divisions) of this most essential and important branch, on which the safety of our dominion depends, and which naturally to the mind of every British officer serving in this land is paramount, must plead for an apparent want of activity for similar labor in the Civil Department, yet I trust in my next tour to be enabled to carry out the orders conveyed in Inspector General's letter No. 1294, dated 16th April 1873. Of the number of lunatic, civil, jail, police, hospitals and dis- pensaries within my two Divisions, extending over an area of about 2,000 miles, I have inspected those enumerated below only Ahmadabad. Kaira. Civil Hospital and Dispensary. Civil Hospital Dispensary. Jail Hospital. Jail Hospital. Police do. Police Hospital. Lunatic Asylmn. Neriad Dispensary. Kakrapait Subsidiary. Mehmudabad do.

LUNATIC ASYLUM. Ahmadabad. 2. The anomaly in this noble institution, healthily situated, just outside the city walls, is the difficulty, to a stranger on first enter- ing the pretty garden in which the building is hidden, to discover who are sane and who the reverse: it is, indeed, a proud feeling that takes possession, if human feeling exists, when traversing the halls and grounds comprising this establishment, the "sua- viter in modo" the "fortiter in re"348 Remained and admis- sions, 5.

Although the gross value of labour from garden products reached Rs. 499, the net sum was but Rs. 93, the balance being expended on purchase of land in proximity, and which will admit of extension of the present building when deemed necessary. Other requisite purchases have also been made, such as bullocks, &c., from above named proceeds. Rs. a. p. Rs. a. p.

DISPENSARIES ATTACHED TO CIVIL HOSPITALS. 63. Hutteesing and Premabhaie Dispensary, Ahmadabad.358 They are amenable to treatment generally, but recur with incen- tives. 68. Alimentary Canal.359 "Throughout, the utmost care has been taken to protect the privi- lege of the poor to gratuitous medicine and medical aid, and in no instance has any fee been ever levied unless the ability to pay has been clearly established and acknowledged. " That the payment rule is regarded as an unpopular innovation, is sufficiently seen in the action of this (Ahmadabad) municipality, the native members of which360 Rajkot Dispensary. Non-payment. 82.

The first notification of this partial change appeared in the newly published dispensary rules, and, I believe, neither the experience of civil surgeons nor collectors was consulted. The system should be temporarily abrogated378 Native medical pupils spoken of chiefly favorably. Buildings. With one or two exceptions the buildings are in good order, some few not considered favorably situated with reference to hygiene, but really, with a knowledge of the usual status of native towns, it would puzzle e'en the sanitary commissioners to find preferable sites for such buildings, always taking convenience into consideration. Clothing and Culinary. A more liberal supply in clothing for in-door patients would seem to be necessary, also a readier means for cooking in cases of emer- gency, and the plan suggested by Dr. Wyllie of meeting such ex- penses, when arising, by a contingent bill, I think would meet every end and purpose. Comparative Statement. It will be seen, by the annexed compilations, the contrasts in amount of treated between the official years 1871-72 and 1872-73, in these very valuable institutions. Suggestions. I now sum up by noting what I conceive to be the additional re- quirements for this division. 1.

R. Miller, M.D., Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, Sind District. During the past season I have visited every town at which an hos- pital or dispensary is maintained, with the exception of Nagar Par- kar. To have undertaken the journey to this extreme point of the Thar and Parkar district would have occupied more time than I could well spare. I had, moreover, when at Umarkot, met with an acci- dent which rendered it unadvisable for me to extend my tour further than was absolutely necessary. 2. The medical history of the past year, as it has affected the health of the people throughout Sind, presents some unusual features which I will briefly notice. It is admitted on all hands that the year under report has been an unhealthy one. Cholera, I am glad to say, has not visited us, although fears at one time existed that it might do so. In the months of July and August last, it prevailed to a con- siderable extent in the Punjab, and was gradually extending to La- hore and in the direction of Mooltan; and it was not unreasonable therefore to suppose that eventually it might find its way down the Indus to Haidarabad and Lower Sind, in the same manner as it tra- velled in 1869. By direction of the Commissioner in Sind I placed myself in communication with the principal medical officer at Mooltan, with the view of receiving early intimation of any out-break of epi- demic cholera that might take place in that neighbourhood. In an- ticipation of its appearance, the medical officer in charge of Sakkhar was instructed to board every boat or steamer arriving from up-stream, and in the event of cholera or doubtful cases existing among them, at once to land and segregate in the hospital set apart for the pur- pose all persons so affected. Other precautionary measures, such as fumigating and thoroughly cleansing all infected vessels, and destroy- ing all bedding and clothing impregnated with the fomites of the disease, were ordered to be carefully carried out before allowing the vessels to proceed on their downward voyage. Intelligence reached me that a few cases only of the disease had appeared at Mooltan, but that no tendency was observed to its spreading or assuming an epi- demic form. Shortly afterwards the disease was reported to have disappeared altogether, taking a north-westerly course. 3. Small-pox has been prevalent in several places, but to no great extent. Nothing approaching an epidemic form of the disease has been noticed: and every year, as the benefits of vaccination become more widely disseminated among the people, the less likelihood is there of this terrible scourge assuming formidable proportions, or to any appreciable extent affecting the mortality of the population. The
395 few cases which have been brought to my knowledge as coming under treatment, have been chiefly at Kurrachee and Manora, but no casualty has occurred. Measles again have been more generally distributed, but still not coming under the denomination of an epidemic. The largest number of cases treated at any single hospital were 16, and this was at the Kurrachee Civil Hospital. No deaths from this disease have been reported to me; nor is it one where, except when compli- cated with other affections or occurring in young and debilitated children, a fatal termination is often witnessed. 4. While therefore neither cholera, small-pox, nor other diseases in an epidemic form have decimated the people, yet during the past year they have suffered in other ways from an unusual amount of sickness; and with, I understand, a somewhat corresponding increase of mortality in places at a distance from medical aid. This increase in the amount of sickness is referable to certain causes which are not far to seek. They are three-fold: (1) a rainfall of unusual quantity and over a large extent of country; (2) the inundation of the river Indus, to which must be added the bursting of several bunds in the upper provinces; and (3) the invasion of dengue fever. 5. With regard to the first: Sind, as is well known, has no mon- soon. it is not visited as are other parts of India by regularly re- curring periodical rains. What does fall, is regarded more as a mat- ter belonging to the chapter of accidents than as an event to be ex- pected and longed for. The amount of rain which fell in 1871 may be regarded as a fair average of what usually falls in Sind. I note below the quantities registered for that year at some of the principal towns in the province, and contrast them with the amount measured at these places for the past year:396 inch be it remembered represents 10,000 tons of water to an acre will in a short time submerge a large extent of country. Without a natural fall, this remains until absorbed or evaporated; and if ad- ditional rain happens to fall at intervals, this drying up is arrested; the soil becomes thoroughly saturated; low forms of minute vege- table and animal life are abundantly developed; and the hot autumnal sun acting upon a large amount of moist surface charged with these conditions397 prevails in November and December398 9. Lunatic Asylum.399 12. The additional warders, 6 male and 1 female, which were sanctioned last year as a temporary measure, have proved very useful, and the comfort and security of the inmates have been greatly in- creased in consequence. The resolution sanctioning this arrange- ment limits it, however, to one year, which expires on the 20th July next. But the necessity for it is so obvious, that it is to be hoped Government will continue it in permanence; or at least until the ad- ditional wards have been built for the refractory and dangerous luna- tics, and a fair trial given of how far under these altered circum- stances the extra hands could with propriety be dispensed with. 13. None of the wells have as yet been covered in. To one of them has been fixed a couple of pumps which supply, in the first instance, a covered-in bath, the water from which is afterwards dis- tributed to the garden. The sleeping blocks in the wards and hos- pital had not been removed at the date of my inspecting the asylum in January last. The suggestions recommended in last year's report in regard to matters of conservancy and sanitary arrangements are still a desideratum, and will be very beneficial when carried out. 14. The general management of the inmates is conducted on wise and humane principles. Medicines, restraint, or coercion are seldom resorted to in the treatment of the special maladies on account of which they have been admitted. Not infrequently the patients have been ill-used and half starved before being received into the asylum; and greater and more rapid improvement is observed to follow their being fed, clothed, and treated with kindness and forbearance, than by the administration of a variety of drugs, which often increase the nervous and mental affections they are intended to alleviate. Dangerous or refractory persons and those subject to periodical fits of excitement are kept as much as possible by themselves; and even to them forbearance and kindness are not omitted; while others again who show signs of improvement and are quiet and tractable, are encouraged to engage in garden work or other light labour. 15. The average cost of each lunatic for the past year, deducting the income derived from their united labour, has been Rs. 72-5-7. 16. The number of lunatics who have come under the notice of Medical Officers and subordinates in the province during the past official year has amounted to 44. Of these 19 were received at the civil hospital, Kurrachee. Out of this number, 1 was a European who was sent to the asylum in Bombay. Other 10 were transferred to the asylum at Haidarabad; 6 were consigned to the care of their friends, and 2 were discharged as sane. At the Kurrachee Jail there was 1 case. He was sent to the Haidarabad asylum. There were two cases treated at the dispensary; one of whom was given over to his friends; the other, who up to the date of his admission with acute mania had been employed as a peon in a merchant's office, died 50 M D
400 after 18 days' treatment. At Haidarabad civil hospital 5 lunatics were admitted. Of these, 1 died three days after admission: 1 was sent to the asylum, and the remaining 3 were discharged greatly relieved. In the jail at that town, 3 cases of mania were treated, one being a female. They all recovered. Three insanes were taken to the civil hospital at Kotri for treatment, but the Medical officer transferred them to the lunatic asylum at Haidarabad without sub- jecting them to treatment. At Sakkhar, two persons were treated at the civil hospital. One was delivered over to his friends who gave security that they would take proper care of him. The other, a case of puerperal mania, was made over to her friends, no benefit having resulted from the treatment received at hospital. Four persons were treated at the Sakkhar Dispensary for insanity. Two of them were given up to their friends on their furnishing security that they would be properly looked after. Another was discharged on being found to be perfectly harmless. And the fourth, a female, who had been brought by her relatives to the dispensary, discontinued attendance on finding no immediate benefit from treatment. Three cases were admitted for treatment at the Rohri Dispensary. They were dis- charged cured. At Umarkot, one man brought by the police under- went treatment for a month, but no improvement taking place in his symptoms, he was forwarded to the asylum at Haidarabad. One man was reported by the Medical Officer of the Khelat Agency to be suf- fering from melancholia. He was in the employ of the Khan of Khelat, and was taken charge of by the Shagazie and sent to his friends. 17. Civil Hospitals.401 past year, the foremost place among the prevailing diseases at the civil hospitals in Sind, is held by malarious fevers, which with den- gue composed upwards of one-third of the whole admissions. Next under the head of important complaints come, in point of frequency, diseases of the lungs; then diarrh402 the Viceroy to Kurrachee in November last, the municipality brought to His Excellency's notice this pressing necessity of supplying the town and camp with pure water, and trusted Government would be induced to help them in carrying to completion some well-digested scheme for supplying this desideratum. Lord Northbrook's reply was sufficiently encouraging to afford reasonable hopes that ere long this reproach to Kurrachee will be removed. 23. The Kotri Civil Hospital has been working well under the care of Dr. Murphy, who gives great attention to his duties, and has been the means of drawing an increased number of patients to the hospital. He has made several good operations, among which were four successful cases of stone. Last year was a peculiarly trying one, owing to the heavy rain and the sudden inundation from a neigh- bouring river, which flooded the town and caused much damage to house property. This was succeeded by a large amount of sickness, of which fever, diarrh403 likewise prevailed, which is to be attributed (1) to the heavy rain-fall and inundation of the river; and (2) to the sanitary defects which abound in the town and neighbourhood. 25. And in connection with this, the great scarcity of water, and for two months of the year its extremely bad quality, cannot be too frequently commented upon. As at Kurrachee, various plans for obtaining a pure and plentiful supply of water have been at different times put forward. And when it is remembered that the Indus is within 4 miles, and a branch404 28. As I mentioned in a former report, this hospital is little else than a Police Hospital. The in-patients are nearly all destitute, half-starved paupers seeking food, clothing and shelter, and are glad to avail themselves of the greater conveniences afforded by this hospital than they can obtain at the dispensary; but for other classes who are differently circumstanced this hospital is very incon- venient, owing to its distance from the town; and every year it will be less resorted to. To maintain this hospital simply for the use of the police, is not only an unnecessary expense, but experience daily shows that, even for this purpose, it is very unsuitable. The lines of the police are at a considerable distance from it, whereas they are close to the dispensary in the town. I would strongly urge therefore that the present Civil Hospital be abolished, and a new ward added to the dispensary for the police. The Civil Surgeon would then be able to conduct the entire duties of the dispensary and police with the help of a good Hospital Assistant, which would save the expense of the present apothecary. And by this arrangement also, a further reduction of expenditure would be effected and that to a considerable extent. The whole set of instruments, medicines, and stores in the Civil Hospital would be at the disposal of Government, and the entire establishment be discharged. 29. The Sakkhar Civil Hospital shows a slight diminution in the number of the in-door patients as compared with the previous year. The percentage of mortality is slightly increased, being 4.8 against 4.1 for 1871-72. The out-door patients however show an increase of 772. In addition to the various classes of persons who come upon the returns of this hospital, and were enumerated in last year's report, there are now engineers, non-commissioned officers, and subor- dinates, who have been lately attached to Sakkhar by the works in connection with the Indus Valley State Railway. These when sick fall under the care of Honorary Assistant Surgeon Leahy, in charge of Sakkhar. As many of these persons live scattered over the place, which is extensive, and require medical aid at their own quarters, Mr. Leahy's duties have been considerably increased and his time is consequently so much occupied, that, with the very inadequate as- sistance he has, he is not able to keep up his clerical work, and many of his returns are in arrears and incomplete; nor do I very well see how, under existing arrangements, he can insure their being exact and punctually rendered. Mr. Leahy is a well informed, hard working man, but he has far too much to do. He occupies a position similar to that of a Civil Surgeon, but with this difference, he has charge of a large dispensary in addition to that of a civil hospital, a jail, and until only lately, the Punjab Flotilla; and yet the subordinate assistance allowed him by the regulations is most meagre and inadequate, and not in keeping with that sanctioned to Civil Surgeons. It is impos- sible, therefore, that Mr. Leahy can do justice to his multifarious
405 duties and at the same time be accurate and punctual in conducting the paper work connected with his various charges. Sanction ought to be given to an hospital assistant being permanently attached under him at the civil hospital, and another at the dispensary. 30. I have not yet received the returns or report of the civil Hospital; only the numbers treated and died; but when I visited Sakkhar in December last, I found Mr. Leahy had during the pre- vious nine months performed several important operations, among which were 4 cases of lithotomy, 3 of them having been successful. 31. In my report for last year, when commenting on the health of the police, I remarked that, owing to the system hitherto pursued, of including such of them as fell sick when on out-post duty in the general list of patients attending dispensaries, no accurate informa- tion could be obtained regarding either the number of sick, their ailments, ratio of deaths to strength or to treated, save such as were recorded under these heads in the police hospitals of the collectorate towns. With the view of remedying this evil, it was ruled about a year ago, that medical subordinates in charge of dispensaries should forward me a register of all policemen treated by them, for trans- mission to the Inspector-General Indian Medical Department, to enable him to compile statistics of the entire Police Force. I am thus able to show in a separate Return (Appendix C) the state of health for the past year of various detachments of police which have had the advantage of medical aid from dispensaries in their neigh- bourhood. From this table it will be seen that406 fever, 4 to diseases of the lungs, and only 1 to affections of the digestive organs. At Haidarabad, where the strength averages 871, there were 5 deaths from malarious fever, 6 from lung disease, and 2 from abdominal affections, out of a total of 16 casualties. The deaths at the Shikarpur Hospital amounted to 3 only, out of an annual strength of 366, and were due to one cause, viz., pneumonia. 32. During the past year there have been no changes in the num- ber of the dispensaries in Sind. They stand as they did at the date of forwarding my last report, and are 23. Considerable alarm was occa- sioned on the receipt of Government Resolution No. 597, of 6th February 1872, introducing the system of payment for medi- cines and advice at dispensaries to all except the really indigent and pauper class. Had this order been applicable to the dispensaries in this Province, it would have had the effect of drawing away the bulk of the applicants for relief, and those who still attended would for the most part have represented themselves as entitled to the exemptions made in favor of the indigent class. A system likewise which includ- ed payments being conducted between the applicants and medical subordinates in charge, would have placed temptations in the way of both parties often too powerful to be resisted, and opened a door for gross abuse and irregularities. But as the resolution of Government decided that payment should be enforced only in such dispensaries as were opened under the rules of 1867, and as all those in Sind, with the exception of the one at Kippra, were established prior to these rules and consequently did not come under their operation, all fears quickly subsided, and the people resorted to them as freely as before. The one at Kippra, though established in 1868 and receiving from Government a grant-in-aid, was likewise exempted on the ground of its being situated in a wild part of the Thar and Parkur District. 33. I append a table (Appendix D) showing the numbers admit- ted and treated as in-door patients in the dispensaries for 1872-73 compared with similar numbers for the previous year; from this table it will be observed that there is a total of 1,515 patients treated, of whom 155 have died; and that while on the one hand there is a diminution of 117 persons, there is on the other a considerable increase in the rate of mortality, which gives a percentage of 10.2 deaths to treated for the past year against 7.0 for 1871-72. The bulk of the casualties have arisen from malarious fevers 23, diseases of nervous system 7, diseases of the lungs 30, diarrh407 the dispensaries at Jacobabad, Sakkhar, Mehur, Taroosha, Sihwan, Alharka-tanda, and Nuggur Parkur. I subjoin a table (Appendix E) giving the number treated for the two past years. 35. As in the case of civil hospitals so in that of dispensaries, no record of deaths occurring among the out-door patients can be furnished. The reasons for this I enumerated in para. 7 of my Report for last year. But there is abundant evidence from the returns of the several Collectors and Political Agent, Thar and Parkur, that the mortality throughout the province has been very high for the past year; the chief causes of which I have indicated in an earlier part of this report. 36. The surgical operations of importance come under the head of in-door patients. They number 119, and nearly all of them, that is 99, were performed at the 3 dispensaries of Jacobabad, Sakkhar and Alharka-tanda. The casualties for the year amounted to 7; the total of operations for stone were 78. 37. The Kurrachee charitable dispensary has relieved 12,461 persons during the past year. This is an increase of 153 compared with the previous one. The average daily attendance has been 148.6, exceed- ing by 10 that for the preceding year. This dispensary has done good service, and was of considerable use during the prevalence of "dengue," 424 persons having received aid for this disease. 38. I had hoped by this time I should have had to report that quarters had been built for the sub-assistant surgeon in charge, in the neighbourhood of the dispensary, so that the provisions of para. 18 of the new rules might now be carried out. But no steps have as yet been taken to supply this desideratum. For want of a pro- per house near the dispensary, the sub-assistant surgeon lives two miles away, and the benefits this dispensary is capable of affording are, in consequence, not as fully developed as they otherwise would be, especially as an evening visit is now enjoined by the new rules. 39. The total expenses of this dispensary for the past year have been Rs. 6,105, of which Government have contributed Rs. 4,807 and the Municipality Rs. 1,298. In 1871-72 the expenses were greater by Rs. 342. 40. The Government dispensary at Manora is still in the same unsatisfactory condition as at the date of my last report. The plans and estimates, as intimated by the Commissioner in Sind, were for- warded to me by the Superintending Engineer. I recommended cer- tain alterations and additions which appeared necessary to render the building suitable to the requirements of Manora. But I am sorry to learn from Government Resolution dated 4th November last, and which is the latest on the subject, that the Government regret there are no funds available for the work. This is greatly to be deplored, as the working of this dispensary is sadly crippled, owing to the 51 M D
408 totally inadequate arrangements which at present exist for the re- ception and treatment of patients. By the last census a total of 1,826 persons, of whom about 80 are Europeans, come under the care of the Apothecary at Manora; besides, during the fair season, or in the presence of an epidemic, his having to attend and visit various ships and native craft coming into the port. There being no accom- modation for in-door patients, all are classed as out-door, and have amounted to 745 against 639 for the previous year. Of the total treated, .92 were Europeans, one of whom, a child, died. The ratio of treated to the strength above noted is 40.7 per cent., which is 8.5 more than for last year, and is due to the general unhealthiness of the season and the presence of dengue. A Goorgah was sanctioned and entertained from the 1st September last, the menial work of the dis- pensary having been previously performed by the Apothecary's private servant. The expenses of this dispensary for the past year amounted to Rs. 1,634; for the previous one to Rs. 1,565. 41. On visiting Keti I found no progress had been made towards building either a dispensary or quarters for the medical subordinate. As a temporary arrangement, the iron dhurmsalla is used, as the hut formerly provided for the purpose was greatly injured during the rains of last year. 1,529 patients were treated against 1,397 for the previous year. In addition to an increase of malarious diseases, there were 65 cases of dengue, and a large preponderance of affections of the lungs and bowels, caused by the heavy rains and the inunda- tion of the river flooding the low-lying land around Keti. I was greatly dissatisfied with the result of my inspection of this dispensary. 1st Class Hospital Assistant P. A. De'Crastos (No. 283) in medical charge, had greatly neglected his duties. He was ignorant or pro- fessed to be so of the prevalence of small-pox in the town, but which according to the kotwal's statement had been twice reported to him. He had performed no vaccination previous to June last, and little or none since, stating as his reason the impossibility of obtaining children. His instruments were disgracefully dirty, and the medicines not cared for and in a disorderly state. The records also were badly kept and in many instances incomplete; and as regards accounts he had none to show me. Altogether his dispensary was the worst conducted in the province. Mr. De'Crastos has proved himself to- tally unfitted for an independent charge, and at my recommendation he has been removed to general duty at Muscat. A good Hospital Assistant has been sent in his place, who has already brought matters into a more satisfactory condition. 42. There is every prospect before long of an excellent dispensary being built at Tatta in the room of the present inconvenient and unsuitable one. The plans which were submitted to me last year have been slightly altered at my suggestion, so as to embrace the requirements recommended in the new rules. The new building with
409 the necessary out-houses are to cost Rs. 3,600. A wealthy native lady at Tatta has consented to give Rs. 2,500 towards it, and the Municipality are expected to make up the remainder of the sum. When at Tatta I approved of a site which is well raised, just outside the town near the mooktyarkar's kutcherry, and conveniently placed for the inhabitants; so I trust that in a few more months this much needed building will be well advanced towards completion. In the meantime, the present one is being used as well as it can; and in place of the miserable house a quarter of a mile distant inside the town in which the in-door patients were treated hitherto, a temporary shed has been erected near the present dispensary. 43. The patients treated have numbered 6,426, being an increase of 314 from the previous year. Only 21 of these have been in- door. This class is scarcely ever drawn from the inhabitants of the town, which circumstance, as also their small number, no doubt arises from the hitherto wretched accommodation provided for them. 44. In my last year's report para. 29a I referred to the importance of Tatta being always provided with a good and efficient medical officer of rank and qualifications not less than those of an rssistant apothecary, and the desirability, therefore, of retaining the services of the present Apothecary Mr. Sylvester. This warrant officer has represented that he receives no extra allowance for the duties which he performs at Tatta, and which are given at almost every other dispensary in the province. On a reference to the Collector it was stated that the municipality contribute Rs. 60 a month for Mr. Syl- vester's services. But it does not appear that the apothecary is in any way benefitted by this allowance, which is probably credited to Government. He merely receives Rs. 180 per month (Rs. 150 pay and Rs. 30 Staff allowance) and which amount he would draw where- ever employed in the Civil or Military Department. The duties at Tatta are often onerous, and will become more so on the new dispensary being built. A man of the Apothecary's class also is quite isolated at such a place, and while there he forfeits all the advantages of society and education for his children which a larger town would afford. I think, therefore, that if the services of an apothecary are desired to be retained for the Tatta dispensary, some provision should be made for placing him on a footing similar to that of other men of his class in Sind. 45. At Jharrak the health of the population has been fair. It quite escaped dengue; and the returns from the dispensary show that the people did not suffer to any great extent from the general unhealthiness prevailing elsewhere. There is an increase of forty- two persons treated as compared with the previous year. Upwards of one-third of these were cases of malarious fever; disease of the
410 bowels and lung affections were likewise prevalent. The Hospital Assistant in charge is a careful steady man and performs his duties creditably. 46. Owing to several changes which have taken place during the past year in the medical subordinates in charge of the dispensary at Mirpur Batora, it has not been so satis- factorily conducted as was formerly the case. In August last the Native Apothecary who had been there a considerable time and had suffered for some years from a chronic form of leprosy, had to go away. The Apothecary sent to relieve him soon fell sick and after five months had to leave, necessitating another one being sent in his place. The evil effects of these changes are shown by a falling off in the numbers treated during the past year, which in the out- door patients amount to 200. Under other circumstances this would not have been the case. Admissions would have been numer- ous, as the country around Mirpur Batora has been extremely unhealthy. Dengue, moreover, prevailed to some extent in the town and surrounding district, and sixty-six cases of this disease were treated. A larger number of cases of syphilis, chiefly in its second- ary and tertiary forms411 work performed there, but also in effecting a considerable saving to Government, and that without risking in the least the amount of benefit this institution is capable of affording. Sihwan was made into a "civil station" by order of the Government of India, dated 29th June 1868; and by rule 28 of G. G. O. No. 392 of 17th idem. Mr. Cooke, the Apothecary at present in charge, draws a monthly salary of Rs. 350. On visiting Sihwan in the course of my inspec- tion tours, and especially on this last occasion, I have not been favorably impressed with either the amount or importance of the work performed by Mr. Cooke. During the past year, with the exception of four dislocations reduced, no operation of importance has been performed, and the total number of persons vaccinated has been only 105, while for the previous year there were but thirty-five. With upwards of 4,000 persons in the town and 45,000 in the talooka, these are but poor results. The Hindoos generally are, I know, averse to vaccination, and especially object to having lymph taken from their children's arms; but persuasion, tact, and perseverance, will go a great way in overcoming their scruples. The order by the Government of India constituting Sihwan a "civil station," was on the ground of its being one of much importance requiring a fully qualified Medical officer; but hitherto the results have not, I think, justified the opinion. At any rate Mr. Cooke has not made it apparent; and indeed, from various circumstances which have come to my knowledge, I do not think the present Apothecary is appreciated by the people, or is himself parti- cularly well suited to them, or the kind of work they require. From what I could learn, the natives would be better pleased to have the services of a good 1st Class Hospital Assistant; but in contempla- tion of the works in connection with the Indus Valley Railway which are to be carried out near this town, this would scarcely be a suffi- cient arrangement. The medical requirements of the place however, after removing Sihwan from the list of civil stations, and transfer- ring the present expensive apothecary elsewhere, would be ade- quately provided for by appointing in his stead another of the same class on the ordinary salary of his rank with the addition of Rupees 30 a month from the Local Funds. The in-door patients have fallen off to exactly half the number, 60, treated in 1871-72; and of this number 20 or two-thirds were the result of injuries. The casualties amounted to 4, giving a mortality of 12.9 per cent to cases treated. The out-door patients however show an increase of nearly 1,000, or a total of 4,538. Malarious fevers have numbered 1,564; diseases of the lungs, 230; affections of the stomach and intestines, 731; and of the liver and spleen 76. Nine cases of fracture and 4 disloca- tions have been treated; but of operations there have been none. 49. No changes have been effected at the dispensary at Mehur since I visited it in 1871-72, though they are greatly needed. It has
412 however, I hear, been determined to make several improvements in the building shortly, so as to admit of better ventilation. The com- pound also is to be enlarged; the present dead house and privy removed, and others erected further away from the main building. For the past year the in-door patients have not been so numerous as for the previous one. These number only 40 against 68; and the mortality also has been higher, 5.0 being the death-rate per cent to treated for this last year compared with 2.9 for 1871-72. An increase of 909 is shown in the number of the out-door patients, bringing up the whole number treated of this class to 3,188. The population of the town is returned at 2,500; but as there are various villages in the immediate neighbourhood who take advantage of the dispensary, I trust now that an active and efficient hospital assist- ant has been sent there lately in the room of the former one, who had not been as energetic as he might have been, a larger field for usefulness will be opened at this place. 50. At the Larkhana Dispensary there has been a total of 6,607 patients treated during the past year, which is an increase of 152 compared with that of the preceding one. The daily average has been 54.6 of those attending as out-door. The in-door patients are one in excess of 1871-72; the mortality considerably less, being 9.8 against 14.0 recorded for the previous oear. The prevailing dis- eases have been those most generally met with in other parts of the province. But affections of the eye, chiefly catarrhal inflammation, have been more numerous here than were observed at any other dispensary in Sind, numbering 1,769 out of 6,607, the total treated. Ulcers were numerous, furnishing many cases of the true "Sind sore." Considering the importance of this town, numbering 7,234 souls, and the populous condition of the surrounding country, a much wider development of the benefits of an institution of this kind would be obtainable if the dispensary was worthy of the town, and of the work which it might be expected to perform. In my last year's report, paragraph 30, I brought to notice the miserable con- dition of the present dispensary, and which no amount of repairs could change or render otherwise than it has always been, a reproach to Larkhana. From what the Commissioner in Sind mentioned in the 15th paragraph of his letter No. 679, dated 15th June 1872, I had hoped, on the occasion of my late tour, to have found a new dispensary ready, and on the site I had previously approved of; but I am sorry to say matters were precisely in the state I had last seen them. On enquiry I learn that there was a difficulty about funds; and, moreover, that the Deputy Collector was in favour of a site different from the one I had selected, which however did not meet with the approval of the Municipality. Within the last two months I have received from the Collector of Shikarpur plans for a new dispensary, which I returned after suggesting sundry improve-
413 ments. As these would involve but little extra cost, I trust that sanction has been accorded, and I would earnestly hope that the site which, after inspecting all the others proposed, I selected as by far the most suitable in every way, may not be departed from. 51. I have to report more favourably of the working of the dis- pensary at Shikarpur for the past year than I was able to do for the previous one. The in-door patients have been 96 against 53 for 1871-72. The rate of mortality however has been nearly double, or 17.7 compared with 9.4 for the preceding year. The out-door patients have been also more numerous, 6,261 against the previous 5,945. When speaking of the civil and police hospital at this town, I have in a measure anticipated the suggestion I have to offer with respect to an alteration in the constitution of this dispensary. With a new ward attached to it for the Police, the civil surgeon would daily have to visit it; and as on the proposed abolition of the civil hospital, he would be relieved from his present attendance there, he should, I think, be put in charge of the dispensary with an hospital assistant and Medical Pupil under him, which would thus save Government the expense of maintaining an Apothecary on Rs. 180 a month. By this arrangement I have no doubt that, with a population of some 50,000, which Shikarpur and the villages withius a radius of 6 to 8 miles are said to contain, the attendance would be largely increased; and a number likewise of important operations would be performed, which would favourably contrast with414 tory organs415 the past year have furnished 293 patients, which is an increase of 35 in the previous one. The rate of mortality has likewise risen, being 15.5 per cent. to treated against 10.4. It is from outsiders and travellers that the numbers of in-door patients are chiefly recruited, and these are often in a sad state of wretchedness and destitution. Hence the mortality of this class will always stand high. There have been 1,103 out-door patients more this year than last; an increase of nearly one-third. This is owing partly to dengue, of which there were 43 cases, and also to the general unhealthiness of the season: but a good, deal of it is directly traceable to the popularity of Honorary Assistant Surgeon Leahy, who is at once kind, energetic, and skilful, and who deserves credit for seeking opportunities of performing various important sur- gical operations, in which he has had considerable success. Besides having had to treat a large number of wounds and injuries, including fractures, he has had 25 cases of stone in the bladder, and the total of his casualties from all of these have amounted to only 6, which speaks well for his surgery and general management. 56. The number of persons receiving medical aid at the Rohri Dispensary for the year under report have amounted to 3,069, which shows an increase of 253 as compared with 1871-72. A slight falling off has been observed in the number of the in-door patients, and yet the rate of mortality has doubled that for the preceding year, being 5.4 against 2.9 of the number treated. One-third nearly of the admissions have been from malarious fevers. Diseases of the stomach and intestines also have been of frequent occurrence. Affections of the respiratory organs were likewise prevalent. Dengue was not once seen, although it was fairly established on the other side of the river. None but minor operations in surgery have been performed. In a previous report I brought to notice the unsuitableness of the present building, it being small and confined, and crowded on all sides by native houses. In anticipation of a greater demand being likely soon to be made on its resources, consequent on the Railway works to be commenced in the neighbourhood, and the increased number of persons this will attract to the town, it would be very desirable that a new dispensary should be built: and I am informed the municipelity are ready to contribute towards this object nearly Rs. 2,000. From a communication lately received from the Collector or Shikarpur, accompanied with plans, I would hope that a measure so beneficial will now not be much longer delayed. 57. At the Tarusha Dispensary, the past year shows a large increase in the amount of work performed. Whereas 1,890 persons were treated in 1871-72, there have been 3,125 who have received medical aid during the year under report, which is an increase of 1,235 patients. In most of the other dispensaries it has been noticed that the in-door patients have been fewer, while the rate of mortality has been higher; but at Tarusha this is reversed. One-third more in-door 52 M D
416 patients, or 96 for the past year against 62 for the previous one, have been treated; and the death-rate, which was 3.2 in 1871-72, is for this year only 1.0. Nearly three-fifths of the whole cases treated were those of malarious fever. After these, in point of frequency, come diseases of the eye (conjunctivitis), affections of the digestive organs and spleen, boils and ulcers. Three cases of snake-bite are recorded: 2 of these were caused by a snake called "Loondie," the other by a "Nag." They were treated with "Richardson's antidote" and recovered. Six "capital" operations were performed, 4 of them being for stone; but on enquiry I found that these were undertaken by Dr. Holmested when he came to inspect the dispensary in June last; and another, a case of amputation, was performed by the former hospital assistant, who is now in the Civil Hospital, Haidarabad. 58. As is the case in most of the other dispensaries, there has been a slight decrease in the number of in-door patients at the Alharka Tanda one, and an increase likewise in the death-rate417 poor in his district. In vaccination also he had done next to nothing having vaccinated only six children in nine months. I have recom- mended the Inspector General to remove him. 60. While the number of in-door patients at Mahomed Khan's. Tanda Dispensary has not varied for the past year, nor the death rate increased, remaining at 1.8 per cent. to treated, a diminution in the attendance of out-door patients to the extent of 51 persons has occur- red. The population of this town, however, is small, and its state of health is more favorably reported of than that of other districts. After fevers the most common diseases have been those of the diges- tive and respiratory systems; also affections of the skin. 61. With reference to the dispensaries in the Thur and Parkur - District and the state of health of the people residing there, it is to be noticed that that part of the country was visited last year by heavy inundation from the Indus, which invaded the country some 20 miles above Sakkhar. The Narra also overflowed, and burst some of its bunds. The consequence of all this was, that a vast extent of country lying between the Haidarabad and Umarkot Districts was completely under water. This slowly dried up, and was followed by great sick- ness among the inhabitants. In the upper portion of the Thur and Parkur District, fever was particularly abundant; affections of the lungs and bowels in a moderate degree. In the lower, fevers were not so prevalent, but diseases of the respiratory and abdominal organs assumed greater importance. At Nuggur Parkur the attendance at the Dispensary has been nearly doubled, the numbers being 2,920 against 1,684 for the previous year. But at the Dispensaries at Miti and Kipra, it is somewhat remarkable that, instead of there being an increase of patients as might have been expected, there is a falling off, and which is most marked at Miti. Here it has amount- ed to 215, while at Kipra the decrease has been 55. At the former town, the population being returned at 5,000 persons, the average daily attendance has been 13.11. At the latter the daily average of the sick has numbered 30.8 out of a population estimated at 1,849. 62. The Umarkot Dispensary is the largest and most important in this part of Sind. The population according to the census of 1872 amounts to 3,579 souls. Of this number 2,936 are Hindoos. The attendance at the dispensary has been within one of that for the pre- vious year, and the daily average has been 48.6. There has been a great decrease in the number of the in-door patients; nearly two- thirds less; but the mortality is nearly the same, having been 7.8 against 7.0 for 1871-72. The great diminution of in-door patients is explained by the circumstance that during the previous year people flocked into Umarkot from the surrounding country in a starving con- dition, and the in-patients for that year were chiefly composed of these. But for the year under report, while Umarkot itself was un-
418 healthy, and some of the people even leaving it for change, the Thur was comparatively healthy. The inhabitants were not, as in former years, under the necessity of moving in search of the necessaries of life, and consequently very few came to Umarkot. The in-door patients, therefore, were almost entirely confined to people of the town and neighbourhood, which accounts for their small number, only 51. Out of the total treated, 4,235, more than one-half, or 2,476, were cases of malarions fever. This disease prevailed more or less through- out the year, but was particularly severe from September to Decem- ber. Dysentery likewise prevailed to a considerable extent; and although the climate was the chief predisposing cause, yet unwhole- some food, heat, and malaria told severely on the poorer classes and rendered them especially liable to this disease. Abscess and ulcers likewise have held a prominent place in the diseases affecting the peo- ple at Umarkot. The subjects of these affections were mostly poor people of the labouring classes, who are much exposed to inclemen- cies of weather, are dirty in their habits, and their diet coarse and often scanty. 63. Last year I reported that the new dispensary at Umarkot was almost finished, and would be ready for occupation in a month. I regret to say, however, that this expectation has not been fulfilled. When I last saw it in March 1872, there needed but a cook-room, dead-house, and some other minor details to be completed; and yet in the succeeding 11 months, no progress had been made beyond raising the walls of the cook-room, and a portion of those of the dead- house, and putting a wall round the compound; which last might have been delayed until the more necessary parts had been finished. This delay is the more to be regretted as the present old dispensary is very unsuitable, and in-door patients have to be accommodated in a shed at some distance. The Police, it is true, had been lately re- moved to a ward in the new building, but this arrangement was very inconvenient, as all medicines and other articles required for their treatment had to be carried backwards and forwards from one dis- pensary to the other. I trust it is only necessary to bring this mat- ter to notice, to insure the whole premises being completed without further loss of time. 64. An account of the Khelat Agency will, before closing the his- tory of the dispensaries, be appropriately entered here, as it presents many of the features of these institutions, though possessing no fixed locality and being based on a different footing. It affords medical aid to the Political Agent, his establishment, and military escort; also to numerous persons who apply for relief at the various stations visited by the Agency. The total number of cases treated was 4,286 against 3,435 for the previous year. Many of these patients were Affghans, either belonging to one of His Highness the Khan's Regi- ments, or pilgrims en-route to Mecca; also from the districts of Sa-
419 rawak and Peshim several people came for treatment. The majority however were Brahooees or Beloochees. Malarious fevers have not affected the people in these parts so much as it has the residents of Sind proper. It is described as usually of a mild tertian type, and was most prevalent in the plains about Gundara and Bagh. Syphilis primary and secondary gave comparatively few admissions. This disease appears not to be of frequent occurrence in this country, but is generally contracted on the frontier. The severe punishment which follows adultery in Beloochistan420 by the people. It was reasonable to expect that an unhealthy year like the past one, would swell the returns from all medical charities, but it is an encouraging sign and one giving promise of good things to come, that, while in 1871-72421 71. With regard to the jails themselves, I have a few remarks to make. As observed in my previous report, the one at Karrachee, owing to the lowness of its position is always more or less damp. It be- comes excessively so after heavy rain, and which is greatly increased on the occasion of spring tides. The evil of this is especially felt in the sleeping pendalls. The Superintending Engineer in Sind has expressed his opinion that raising the floors of these one foot will not prevent the damp from below rising up, and that nothing short of spreading a layer of asphalt on a three-inch bed of concrete will in- sure a dry surface for the prisoners to lie down on. This he says will cost Rs. 3,200 for the 10 pendalls. In anticipation of a scheme which last year the Commissioner in Sind informed me was under consideration, in consequence of the town increasing rapidly round the jail and the enhanced value of the land it occupies, of removing it altogether to a higher and drier position, it would hardly be worth while to incur this expense if the arrangement is likely to be soon carried out. And the more especially as the past year which was one of the wettest experienced for several years, has not effected the health of the prisoners. This has been pretty good; nor were there any particular symptoms in their complaints which could fairly be attributed to the conditions under which they live. The mortality was caused chiefly by fevers, dysentery, and diarrh422 The Superintendent, Dr. Holmested, mentions having lately received a grant of Rs. 200 from the Inspector General of Prisons, which he proposes to expend in procuring a quantity of the patent magnetic carbide from England, and construct a large filter, which he calculates will purify 300 gallons of water daily. This to a certain extent will be beneficial, but at best will prove but a very poor substitute for a plentiful supply of water direct from the river. I have already, when noticing this subject in connection with the civil hospital at Haidarabad, endeavoured to point out some of the evils resulting from the scarcity and bad quality of the water-supply; and, as it is a question of great importance, I trust, I may be excused if I again draw attention to the matter. It is one which every year forces itself more prominently into notice, and must continue to do so, until 423 acting on previously debilitated subjects. Nearly all the prisoners in this jail are employed in out-door labour, and as a good portion of their work consists in excavating silt from canal beds, they appear specially liable to malarious influences and pulmonary affections. The ventilation of the barracks has been lately much improved by piercing the walls close under the roof with windows at suitable intervals. The latrine which was recommended to be constructed has not yet been built, and the conservancy arrangements are still very inefficient and unsatisfactory. 76. The average strength of prisoners in the Umarkot Jail has been somewhat higher for the past year than for the preceding one. It has been 144 against 130; and yet I regret to have to report that nothing whatever has been done to increase the sleeping accommoda- tion. The remarks I made on this matter in para. 48 of my previous report may be repeated word for word in the present one, and with this addition, that as the strength for the past year has been great- er, and seven inches and fifty cents of rain fell in three months, when, of course, the prisoners could not sleep in the open court, all the evils I then brought to notice with respect to their terribly overcrowded condition at night, have been intensified. On theoretical grounds it would be natural to expect from this state of things an exceptionally high death-rate; but although it is double that of the previous year424 regular, is not excessive; and this kind of life, even when pursued in an unhealthy district, gives results much more favourable than might be expected. In not a few instances however the health breaks down, not from the work or mode of living, but from climatic influen- ces acting upon some latent organic defect. In these cases the men are sent away to some permanent jail for change and treatment. 78. My inspection of the small subordinate jails enables me to re- port on them in generally favorable terms. The one at Tatta was clean, sufficiently large, well ventilated, and suitable. 79. At Sihwan, an attempt has been made by piercing the wall with two windows, to remedy the original blunders at the time of construction, and which I pointed out in the last year's report. But the benefit in the matter of ventilation is not apparent; and the ac- commodation is as limited and confined as ever. Nothing short of throwing down the wall at the rear, including more ground, and substituting strong palisades for the one in front, will effect any real improvement in this jail, or render it otherwise than the hottest in Sind. 80. At Mirpur Batora, there are two wards, which are ventilated through the roof. They were clean and in good repair. Prisoners are seldom detained over a week or ten days. 81. The disposition of the wards, ventilation, and other matters in connection with the jail at Mahomed Khan's Tanda were previously reported on, and there is no change in these respects to notice this year. The jail was in good repair, but the prisoners were not equal- ly distributed through the different wards. I found some 12 or 14 huddled together at one end of a ward, the rest of it being useless in consequence of their having stopped about the water from a large earthen pot, placed for drinking. The other ward of similar size con- tained only 4 prisoners and one small ward was empty. A more judicious distribution of the inmates would be beneficial. There had been but little sickness among them for the year. 82. Two small wards have been lately added to the jail at Alhar- ka Tanda; they are ventilated from the roof, are provided with small open courts, and are sufficient for the accommodation of 2 to 3 prisoners. The premises were clean and in good state of repair. 83. In last year's report I took occasion to notice that the ward in the male portion of the jail at Taroosha, termed the "murderer's ward" was totally unprovided with any means of ventilation, the doors being solid, and the walls destitute of windows or ventilators of any kind. At the date of my visit425 introduced above. In the female quarters, no window had been placed in the lunatic cell as recommended, in consequence, as was said of the facilities this would afford to people outside holding communication with the inmates. An outer door however had been put to the small court leading into this cell, so as to admit of the prisoners sleeping there in the hot weather which formerly they could not do. This large jail was almost empty. It was clean and all its arrangements, with the exception of those mentioned, were satisfactory. 84. The jail at Halla was clean and not crowded. Tried and un- tried prisoners are fastened at night to a chain which runs the length of their wards. This is done in consequence of the latter being un- provided with doors. But it is a very objectionable arrangement. Doors of iron bars should be supplied, and the roof of the wards pierced with orifices, otherwise ventilation will be impossible. No casualty has occurred and the sickness has been slight. 85. Since my inspection a year ago of the district jail at Mehur, the right wing which had fallen in has been re-built. It now corres- ponds with the one on the other side, and is provided with a similar outer walled enclosure to which the prisoners can have access. Ven- tilation has been well attended to, there being a couple of iron-bar- red windows ueder the roof, and as the doors are also of the same construction, a sufficient circulation of air is maintained. The prison- ers, of whom there were very few, appeared to be well fed and cared for. 86. In my last year's report on the Larkhana District Jail, I took occasion to notice the entire absence of all means for ventilating the wards which are 3 in number; and I recommended that a couple of small iron-barred windows should be let in under the roof. This has been done in one ward, and the improvement in the state of the atmosphere was very apparent. In the other ward426 89. At Miti the prison accommodation is unsatisfactory. There are a couple of rooms but only one of them is used, the other being appropriated to stores. The one set apart for prisoners is 18 feet by 12, and as many as 14 prisoners are sometimes confined in it, the average being 9. There is no outer court neither is there any opening in the roof; the windows and doors have iron bars, but these are not sufficient for ventilation. 90. The working of the above subordinate jails are, taken as a whole, satisfactory. As a rule the detention of the prisoners does not exceed a month. During that time their food is sufficient and of good quality. When employed in out-door work they receive an extra quantity. There is little or no sickness seen among them; and when requiring treatment they are either taken to the hospital assistant in charge of the neighbouring dispensary, or he visits the jail and prescribes for them. In most cases they have coarse country blankets and some article of clothing for the night. In no case did I perceive any reasonable ground for complaint. 91. With regard to matters of conservancy as carried out in Sind, I have already spoken of the admirable manner in which this is attended to in the jails of sudder towns. In these it is systematic and compulsory, but as the requisites necessary to effect any corres- ponding condition in the towns and villages throughout the province are, owing to the habits and prejudices of the natives, quite in- applicable, it is hopeless to look for any material improvement in sanitary matters427 have attached to them a small court surrounded with high walls. In this, it is usual to find litter and rubbish of various kinds piled about in hopeless confusion; a cow or more with, perhaps, some goats, tethered near the inevitable dung heap; poultry often running about; and in one corner a latrine resorted to by all the women and children in the house, and some times also by the men. Into this court is discharged for the most part, the refuse water from the house forming in time a huge and seething cess-pool; and into the soil from one year's end to another percolates not only this foul fluid, but also the urine and liquid excrement of human beings and animals. If we enter the house, the windows are generally shut, the floors cowdunged, and the walls innocent of whitewash; clothes, bedding, and articles of domestic use, grimy and unwashed. In short, dirt is seen within and without; poisonous exhalations are constantly being developed, and which for want of ventilation are permanently located in the premises. This is by no means an overdrawn picture, and when this state of things is multiplied by the number of houses in a town or village, it must be admitted that by confining sanitary measures merely to the streets and lanes of a city, it is after all, but whitewashing the outside of the sepulchre and leaving untouched the fons et origo mali. The people are a long way removed from that condition of civilization which can enable them to understand the evils, which as certainly follow this total disregard of all sanitary measures in connection with their dwellings, as is seen to be the case when nature's laws are in other instances neglected. They have been so long accustomed to this state of things; their prejudices in regard to caste and interference in their domestic concerns are so strong and deep rooted, that a feeling of intense irritation and repugnance would certainly be aroused were any law to be put in force which would throw their doors open to the admission of the nuisance inspector. Before this could be done, the feeling of the people must so far be consulted, and their acquiescence and assistance enlisted on our side. But this, even under the most favorable circumstances, will be the work of years. In the meanwhile we must exercise patience, and look forward to the time when through education and intercourse with more enlightened persons than themselves, the natives will come to appreciate the benefits of sanitation, and be glad not merely to see it applied in a general way to their towns, but be ready to welcome its operations in their private dwellings. 92. Much, however, might be done throughout the country, which would have the effect of diminishing sickness, and improving the health of the people, and would in no way offend the prejudices of the inhabitants. To mention one only, the supervision and protec- tion of the water supply for domestic purposes from contamination should be placed under stringent regulations. Wells sufficient for
428 the wants of a town or village might be dug in suitable positions removed from all possible sources of pollution. Each of these should form the centre of a walled enclosure of, say, 40 to 50 yards radius, within which no cattle should ever be permitted to enter. The wells should be covered in and supplied with pumps to prevent the possi- bility of vessels or buckets being lowered into them. Penalties should be imposed upon any one washing either their clothes or persons within the enclosure or committing other nuisance. On these wells being completed, all those inside the town or near houses should be closed. The expense of adopting such measures is doubtless the main objection to them; but this might be got over by degrees; and the more readily so, if the municipalities or local bodies could be made to understand the importance of the matter, and that all existing wells under the present system of drawing water, are, more or less, polluted; and that those situated in a town or in the vicinity of houses, are continually receiving contamination; or, in other words, sewage, which is poison. 93. Another point bearing on the health of the people and which is but another branch of the same subject, is the thining of trees, lopping freely the lower branches of the others, removing weeds and undergrowth, regulating the height and thickness of hedges, and burning heaps of rubbish in and around gardens. No progress has been made in these matters either at Mehur or Tarusha. In the latter town they are even worse than they were. A good number of trees have been cut down at Larkhana but the gardens do not seem to have been interfered with. Abundant evidences are apparent at Jacobabad in the stumps of trees remaining in the ground, that the axe has been at work; but even there also much remains to be done. And there is still great need for removing the undergrowth and neglected vegetation which I observed in far too great abundance. These not only intercept the breeze, but collect rubbish and debris at their roots, which, in turn, add their quota to the already too numer- ous agents at work in propagating disease at Jacobabad. 94. A great improvement likewise would be effected in the salu- brity of this station were one-fourth or even one-third of the small water-courses filled up. On the laying out of the cantonment these were deemed necessary to nourish the young trees; but as these are now grown up, and many of them also should be removed, it can no longer be requisite to keep open the water-courses, and by admitting the Indus water into them, to maintain that condition of hypersatura- tion of the atmosphere which is one of the evils complained of at Jacobabad. It would also be the means of reducing the extent of surface charged with decomposing matter on the subsidence of the river, and thus lessen the number of centres for the generation of a poison already present in too great abundance, and which429 95. I cannot speak in very encouraging terms in reference to the amount of, or success attending vaccination as performed at the civil hospitals and dispensaries in the province. At the former, vac- cination is not carried out by the civil surgeons or their establish- ment, but by a vaccinator provided by the municipality. He forwards his returns direct to the superintendent of vaccination to be incor- porated in those from his office. He also brings specimens of his work for the inspection and approval of the civil surgeons. These vaccinators, besides operating in the sudder towns and suburbs, extend the area of their duties to the neighbouring villages, and likewise visit the various hospitals, e.g., at Kurrachee and Haidarabad, on requisitions made by their respective medical officers. 96. Apothecaries and hospital assistants in charge of dispen- saries have been repeatedly instructed that vaccination is a most important part of their duties, and that they are to use their utmost endeavours to disseminate the benefits of this prophylactic. But their labours in this direction are very desultory and unsatisfactory. 97. At Shikarpur and Sakkhar, Apothecary Mr. Neil and Hono- rary Assistant Surgeon Leahy are most willing to do all in their power to carry out the orders on this matter; but they find their exertions fruitless in consequence of their having existed for years at these towns municipal vaccinators, who are well known to the people, and to whom the latter resort in preference to going to the dispensaries in charge of the medical officers. But at other dispen- saries where this arrangement does not prevail, the amount of vacci- nation generally performed falls far short of what it ought to be. Various reasons are assigned for this. One of the most common is, that the mooktyarkars do not interest themselves in the matter, and afford little or no assistance to the medical subordinates in procuring them children, or inducing the parents to submit them to be operated upon. This is so uniformly alleged by the hospital assistants as the chief cause for meagre returns, and especially so when the mooktyar- kar is a Hindoo, that I am constrained to give it a certain amount of credence. Against this it may be urged, that difficulties of this des- cription are not experienced by the superintendent of vaccination and his establishment, but on the contrary; that the mooktyarkars and other local authorities render them much assistance. It would be rather beside the mark to enquire whether this help on their part arises from a conviction of the benefits of vaccination being so great as that they should be allowed to overbalance considerations of cus- tom, prejudice, and caste, not to speak of the opposition brought to bear upon the question by the female portion of the community. But it must be remembered that the Vaccination Department with its superintendent, its assistant superintendents, its clerks, peons, vaccinators, and their assistants, spread, as they are, throughout the
430 country, are regarded by all classes of the people, as a strong expres- sion of the wishes, if not the will, of "the Sircar;" and a consider- able amount of respect, not altogether unmixed with fear, is, in con- sequence, shown to the department. The work therefore in place of being impeded, is materially assisted by these very mooktyarkars and local authorities, who yet can disregard similar applications for assistance in vaccination matters, when preferred by hospital as- sistants without tangible and influential supporters on the spot. 98. In my last report I mentioned, that I was recommending the Inspector General, Indian Medical Department to increase the num- ber of native medical pupils, so as to admit of my placing one at every dispensary which had only an hospital assistant, as it has been frequently urged by these as a valid reason for the small amount of vaccination performed, that the lymph is frequently lost431 none more so than at Haidarabad. With regard to the process it- self, it is surrounded with so many difficulties and so much uncer- tainty that it is never likely to become popular or to make much way except under considerable pressure, or in times of panic. 101. A few words on the meteorology of the province during the past year may432 60°. The extreme dryness of the air allows radiation to proceed very rapidly, which thus accounts for the nights being generally cool and pleasant even in the hottest weather. In the early part of January in the districts midway between Haidarabad and Tarusha, severe cold was felt for a few days433 to nearly the end of October; and from that time until the return of the hot season the weather is pleasant and bracing. In the months of December and January last, the cold, especially in the early morn- ing was considerable. And it is these sudden changes of tempera- ture which cause pulmonary affections to prevail at this season. Dur- ing the hot weather, the atmosphere is extremely dry, and the heat as great during May and June as in any other part of Sind. The register of thermometer kept at Umarkot is therefore incorrect as the highest reading recorded is only 106° and the lowest 50°. As a rule thermometers are placed in the verandahs of hospitals. They should be in the open air at some little distance from a building and shelter- ed from the rays of the sun. But this arrangement, simple as it is, cannot be easily managed owing to the risk of the thermometer being stolen, and which has in not a few instances occurred. During the cold season in the Thur and Parkur district the winds have generally blown from the N. and N.E. In the hot weather, they were moder- ate from the W. and S.W. and at times altogether absent. During the monsoon month more or less breeze prevailed from the same quarter, and on two or three occasions thunderstorms were experi- enced. The sand hills of the Thur, being unaffected by the inunda- tions of the Indus and its branches, are far more healthy than Umar- kot and the towns on the Narra. Many of the inhabitants suffering from disease, especially fevers, found great benefit by leaving these parts and proceeding for a while to the desert. 107. I had hoped before concluding this report to have been able to supply tables showing the exact cost of each of the civil and jail hospitals and dispensaries in Sind for the past official year with a statement of amount of receipts from Government, municipalities, or local funds, as also similar returns for the two preceding years, in order that a comparison might be made of the expenses of these institutions for the periods mentioned and their corresponding results; but, I regret to say, I have been unable to obtain all the items necessary to render these complete.

Medical Administration. No. 1087. GENERAL DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY CASTLE, 15TH APRIL 1874. Letter from the Surgeon General, Indian Medical Department, No. 3094, dated the 4th October 1873, forwarding with remarks the Annual Administration and Progress Report of his Department for 1872-73. RESOLUTION.2 results into his own report. The latter should be, as far as possible, in a narrative style, eschewing tabular statements in the text as far as possible. In this manner the year's results under each head will be clearly brought home both to Government and to the reader, and good working and bad working will be clearly seen. 4. The Surgeon General is requested to issue the necessary instructions to his Deputies, to ensure this being carried out. It will be as well to consult the reports from other parts of India, so as to have the benefit of others' experience in laying down the frame-work of various reports; but this is a matter of detail which Government will leave entirely to Dr. Thom. There is one point to which they would invite his special attention, which is, that purely professional details should appear separate from those relating to administration; for instance, the list of the various surgical operations performed in a hospital or group of hospitals would come under the latter category, the detailed description of a certain specially difficult and successfully performed operation would come in the former. Such details had always be best grouped together in one place towards the end of the report. They will be there more accessible to professional men. Similarly, special experiments as to the treatment of disease, such as cholera, hydrophobia, or the like, should find a place by them- selves. 5. At present only the reports of Deputy Surgeons General are sent up to Government. In the case of lunatic asylums, however, the original reports of the Superintendents should also be sent in future. Any specially good reports from Civil Surgeons or Officers in charge of dispensaries, might in addition be forwarded with the general reports on those institutions. 6. Government hope that one benefit of the division of the Medical Report into three, will be seen in the transmission of them to Government at an early date. The Surgeon General should have them printed at the Central Press, and one complete copy sent for Government to review. The remaining copies of the report will afterwards be bound up together with the Resolution of Government and published. 7. Government will now turn to the consideration of the details of the Report for 1872-73 at present under review. LUNATIC ASYLUMS. 8. Colaba Asylum.3 48, or 15.5 per cent., were cured, 12 discharged to friends, 22 or 7.1 per cent. died, and 226 remained. Of the 55 Europeans, 53 were males and 2 females, the average daily strength being 3 males and 2 females. One male only was a re-admission. Of the 308 Natives, 253 were males and 55 were females, 6 males and 2 females being re-admissions. The average daily number was 181 males and 42 females. 9. The new wards that have been built have materially added to the accommodation, though Dr. Niven still complains of overcrowd- ing. The Deputy Surgeon General at the same time points out that, taking the last 23 years, the average daily number of Natives in the asylum was 210, or only 13 less than in the year under report; and that the general statistics do not show any marked increase in the number of insane of late years. Until, therefore, Government are in a position to build a new asylum, of which there does not appear at present any near prospect, all that can be done is to see that the addi- tions that have been made are utilized to their utmost. At the same time, it is most disappointing to learn that, in the opinion of so able and experienced an officer as Dr. Johnstone, the new wings are badly arranged and ill-finished. This should be brought to the notice of the Public Works Department. 10. There is no question but that another airing court is urgently required for this asylum, and it has been entered by the Public Works Department in next year's budget. An estimate should also be made for the other improvements suggested by the Deputy Surgeon General at page 261 of the report. The attention of Dr. Niven should be drawn to the desire expressed in the Resolution on last year's report, that gardens should be formed, if possible, in the yards, and Government hope that this will not be lost sight of. They do not expect it to be profitable. A beginning has, they understand, already been made. 11. It is satisfactory to learn that attempts have been made to separate the lunatics according to their behaviour, or according to the nature of the mental disease from which they suffer. 12. The tables attached to the report show that not only in this, but in all the asylums, the classification of the forms and the causes of insanity, as well the caste and sex of the lunatics, is receiving attention. The rates per cent. of known causes is at present only small, ranging from 13.3 per cent. at Dharwar and 17.0 per cent. amongst Europeans at Colaba, to 60.83 (not 0.87 as erroneously stated in the printed report) at Haidarabad, and 62.1 at Ahmedabad. All Magistrates and Officers sending lunatics to asylums, should again be warned to be most particular in sending the history of all lunatics, as far as it can be discovered, with them to the asylum. When the percentage of known causes becomes higher, it will be possible to expand the tables, so as to show the various relations which sex and caste bear to the different causes and forms of insanity. Most of the European lunatics at Colaba being soldiers, Government would have thought particulars as to the cause of insanity in these cases
4 would have been more accurately known than in any other class of patients. The reverse, however, is the case. 13. In future years tables, like those which Dr. Niven appears to supply for Colaba, but which have not been printed with the report, should be furnished with the report of each asylum. One should also be given classifying the lunatics according to their length of residency in the asylum. The Surgeon General should be asked to revise all the tables, so as to give the fullest details possible as to sex, race, caste, age, disease, mortality, &c. 14. Indo-Europeans and mixed races should, in future, in prepar- ing statistics, be separately shown; under Europeans, if they are treated as Europeans, otherwise under Natives. 15. The question as to the necessity of sending the ordinary papers with soldier insanes has been disposed of in Government Resolution No. 2451, dated the 12th July last. 16. The employment of patients appears to have had attention paid to it. It is useless to expect too much in this respect. Govern- ment, however, would be glad to learn that some of the more tractable of those who have been for some time in the asylum have been taught some regular simple kind of work. They are under the impression that, with the exception of epileptics, idiots, and those suffering from acute mania, a good deal of useful work could be obtained from a large proportion of the patients. 17. Poona Asylum.5 24. Cowasjee Jehangheer Asylum, Haidarabad.-At this asylum 143 have been treated, of whom 43 were admitted during the year. The number cured or discharged improved was 30 or 20.9 per cent. Deaths amounted to 17 or 11.8; of these 12 are, in the Deputy Sur- geon General's opinion, traceable to the unusual rainfall, and the annual inundation affecting the site of the asylum. Care should be taken to notice, in the report which will soon be due, the effect which the site and the inundation have had in 1873-74 on the health of the patients; and suggestions should be made with a view to obviat- ing any remediable evil. In a recent Memorandum received from the Army Sanitary Commission, the necessity for improvements of this Institution has been strongly enforced. And His Excellency in Council has no doubt that the subject will receive all proper attention from Dr. Holmstead, with whose general management His Excellency the Governor had reason to be much pleased on his recent visit. 25. No details have been given of the work performed by the patients, and on this point full information should be given in the next report. Criminal Lunatics. 26. These were as follows:6 ment presume Dr. Niven has taken measures to prevent similar escap- es in future, and that the warders under whose charge the lunatics were have been called to account. 32. It appears that, besides those in lunatic asylums, no less than 303 insanes were treated in Jail, Police, and Civil Hospitals. Except that there are lunatics kept at Satara, and that the old Civil Hospital at Dhulia is mentioned as one place where insanes were accommodated, and that the insanity of many is doubtful, nothing more can be learnt on the subject of these lunatics from the report. Government desire that detailed reports about them should, in future, accompany the General Lunacy Report. 33. This is the first year in which the finance of medical institu- tions has been treated of. It is unreasonable to expect that the tables would be perfect to commence with, and those now sub- mitted require a little explanation. For instance, in Column 1 of Table No. 4, the average daily number of European patients at Colaba is put down at 10.3, but in para. 15 page 124, the average is said to have been 3 males and 2 females. If this last figure is correct, then the average cost of each lunatic must be double what it is stated to be in column 6 of the tabular statement. As it is, the cost as calculated for a daily number of 10.3, viz., Rs. 371-1-6, is not apparently accurate. The average daily number of Natives is also according to the table 217.8, according to the Deputy Surgeon General 223. Again, it is not understood where the pay of the Superintendent of the Colaba Asy- lum appears. It is presumed it has been divided rateably between the "Establishment under Europeans and Natives," though this is doubtful. The sum put down as the pay of the Establishment of the Haidarabad Asylum is undoubtedly wrong. According to the table given by the Deputy Surgeon General, it came to Rs. 5,855, while that compiled in the Surgeon General's Office shows only Rs. 2,755. 34. Government trust, therefore, that an endeavour will be made to have these tables compiled with greater correctness in the coming year. It will be well to divide cost of Establishment into: 1st, Euro- pean Superintendence; 2nd, Subordinate Medical Establishment; and 3rd, Servants and Others. The income derived from lunatics' labour should also be divided into cash receipts and estimated value of labour. Other miscellaneous receipts, if any, should also be taken credit for. 35. It is hardly worth while commenting on figures the accuracy of which cannot be depended on. It may, however, be noted that the difference between the cost of dieting at different places is most startling, and this is an item in which there is probably little or no error. At Bombay the cost of dieting a Native lunatic is Rs. 123-7-0 per annum, or Rs. 10-5-5 a month. This is far too high. At Poona, it is Rs. 69-5-10, or Rs. 5-12-5 a month. At Haidarabad in Sind, on the other hand, the cost is only Rs. 33-5-6, or Rs. 2-12-5 per month. Government request that Dr. Thom will have these figures carefully looked into, and, if they are correct, to ascertain whether no economy, especially in Bombay, is feasible.
7 JAIL HOSPITALS. 36. The following Table shows the Sickness and Mortality in Jails:8 39. There are general complaints made of the overcrowding in jails. This is a matter which has been noticed in the Annual Jail Report. It is, however, out of the question to suppose that funds are available to carry out a tithe of the additions that might be recom- mended on purely scientific principles. Government agree with Dr. Maitland's remarks that " while calculating the capacity of a jail, "little or no allowance seems to be made for the healthiness or " otherwise of the climate in which they are situated; in other words, " no difference in cubic capacity is allowed for the good or bad climate influences surrounding them." In specially bad cases, such as that noticed by Dr. Miller at Umarkot, the Superintendents of Jails should make a separate recommendation to the Inspector Gene- ral of Prisons on the subject; but the absence of epidemic, as well as the fact that deaths are almost always attributable to causes wholly unconnected with the jails where they occur, and the low rate of mortality, show that the jails are, as a rule, sufficiently large and healthy. 40. This part of the report hardly calls for further remarks, but the attention of the Inspector General of Prisons should be called to it. The inspection of the jails by the Deputy Surgeons General has been thoroughly carried out in all divisions except in the Northern Divi- sion, and Government anticipate very good results from this being done annually. The recommendation made at page 38 of the Surgeon General's Report relating to incurable prisoners should be transferred to the Judicial Department for disposal, and the Public Works Department should be asked to make immediate arrangements to improve the state of the Tarusha and Hala Jails brought to notice by the Deputy Surgeon General in Sind (pages 424-425 of the Report). The suggestions made by Dr. Turner, as to the fettering and clothing of prisoners, should also be transferred to the Judicial Department for consideration. POLICE HOSPITALS. 41. The following Table is given of the Sickness and Mortality of Police:9 CIVIL HOSPITALS. PRESIDENCY DIVISION. European General Hospital. 42. The number of in-patients is stated in different places to have been 1,117 and 1,100. There were 516 out-patients. Deaths num- bered 47. The cost was Rs. 89,122 against Rs. 85,826 in the previous year, the receipts having fallen from Rs. 4,888 to Rs. 3,400. This was probably due to the late Purveyor's frauds; and the careful super- vision, which, it is hoped, will now be exercised, will tend to bring down the cost in 1873-74. The care taken by the Medical Officers of the patients seems to have been all that could be desired. Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital. 43. The cases treated in the wards were 6,290 in number, of whom 1,015 died. The in-patients at this hospital increase in number every year. There were also 35,220 out-patients; the net cost of the institu- tion to Government was Rs. 2,04,292. The opening of the Goculdass Tejpall Hospital will relieve this institution to a certain extent. The management has been excellent, and deserves the acknowledgment of Government. 44. The Public Works Department will, it is understood, be in a position to carry out at least a portion of the improvements, recom- mended at page 146 of the Report, in 1874-75. 45. Government will be glad to receive definite suggestions for the improvement of the purveying system in this hospital. There will be more chance of its being sanctioned, if the Surgeon General sees his way to a reduction in branches of the staff, so as to provide in part for the extra cost. 46. The more complete registration of medical cases which has been commenced is a valuable measure, and should certainly be carried out as far as possible. Government are of opinion that arrangements can easily be made to ensure this being done with fulness and accuracy by the present establishment. Obstetric Institution. 47. There were 95 cases and 7 deaths. In 1871-72 there were 90 cases and 3 deaths. In time this branch of the hospital will, there can be no doubt, be much more resorted to than at present. The cost is included in that of the hospital. Cowasjee Jehangheer Ophthalmic Hospital. 48. There were 6,259 cases, of which 364 were in-patients. The popularity of this institution is evidently increasing with great rapidity, and this is no doubt in a great measure due to the com- mendable exertions of Dr. Maconachie and Assistant Surgeon DeGama, the Medical Officers in charge. The cost was Rs. 12,939. 2 R
10 49. The remaining hospitals of this Presidency Division do not call for lengthy detailed notice. Great care has been taken by Dr. Johnstone, the Deputy Surgeon General, in inspecting them, and Government are glad to acknowledge his zeal and energy. 50. It is to be regretted that the report of the Surat Hospital in particular should not reflect credit on the officer in charge. All Civil Surgeons should be given distinctly to understand that they, and not their subordinates, are responsible for the correctness of the books and the whole management of their hospitals. At Surat, as well as other places, the paucity of surgical operations argues a want of interest, which is not creditable, especially when compared with the results achieved by officers like Drs. Bainbridge and Holmstead. POONA DIVISION. Sassoon Civil Hospital. 51. At this institution 1,919 in-patients were treated, as well as 11,564 out-patients. The cost was Rs. 44,506. The annual report on this institution has already been reviewed by Government. It should be included in the general report in future. 52. It is satisfactory to learn that the management of the other Civil Hospitals in the Poona Division was good and economical. 53. The want of quarters for a Hospital Assistant at Sholapur, a new ward and dead-house at the Sassoon Hospital, of a new Civil Hospital at Kaladgi, and of additions to the Satara Hospital, should be brought to the notice of the Public Works Department, as well as the remarks that have been recorded as to the delay in commencing the new Civil Hospital at Dharwar. NORTHERN DIVISION. 54. As already noticed, the Deputy Surgeon General in the Northern Division visited very few civil medical institutions, having confined his tour to the Ahmedabad and Kaira Collectorates. Go- vernment hope that, in the official year which has just closed, it will be found that he has been able to afford as much attention to the Civil Department as the other Deputy Surgeons General, without detriment to his military duties. Government have to remark that some por- tion of Dr. Turner's report are of somewhat too conversational character. 55. The Hutteesing and Premabhaee Hospital has an endowment of Rs. 62,000, but the column in the financial statement shows a blank where interest should appear. The accommodation and esta- blishment at this hospital are stated to be insufficient. Any rea- sonable proposals for remedying this, showing precisely how matters stand at present and what extra expenditure is wanted, will receive full consideration. Government are afraid there is no hope of building an extra ward for some time to come. 56. The number of persons treated at this hospital was 2,263, plus 7,371, or 9,634 altogether, as against 20,030 in 1871-72. The
11 falling off is attributed to the introduction of the payment system. The numbers of in-patients and out-patients have not been separately stated, either for this or the other Civil Hospitals. 57. The Civil Hospitals at Kaira and Rajkot call for little remark. The efficiency of the former has no doubt been much increased by its removal into the new building. The latter has done much good, and seems most popular. The want of a new surgical ward should be brought to the notice of the Political Agent, who will, if he thinks fit, report upon it to Government. When the new Guzerat Vaccination Circle has received the sanction of the Government of India, the Civil Surgeon will be able to devote his entire time to this hospital. The Sadra and Dohud Hospitals do not require special mention. SIND DIVISION. 58. The reports of the state of the Civil Hospitals in Sind, especial- ly that at Haidarabad, are satisfactory. 59. The falling off in the number of out-patients at Shikarpur has not been explained. The amalgamation of this hospital with the dispensary will be conducive of much benefit. 60. Government take great interest in the instruction of Native women as midwives, and request that the results of Dr. Hohmstead's zealous endeavours in this direction may be fully noticed every year. They trust that the Surgeon General will be able to arrange with some competent officer to commence a similar school in the older provinces. 61. An additional Hospital Assistant to assist Dr. Leahy, at the Sakkhar Dispensary, has already been sanctioned. GENERAL RESULTS. 62. The aggregate total of patients treated at Civil Hospitals, according to the table compiled by the Surgeon General, was as follows:12 table they came to 378 European and 45,049 Natives13 expenditure of the different Civil Hospitals cannot be commented on. Taking, however, the figures compiled by the Surgeon General to show the aggregate cost of each patient, (which, it is presumed, includes both in-door and out-door patients,) it may be observed that the cost per head varied from As. 10-8 at Haidarabad to Rs. 53-5-4 at the European General Hospital. At Kaladgi and Shikarpur, owing to the falling off in the number of patients, it rose from Rs. 1-11-8 and Rs. 4-1-5 to Rs. 7-10-6 and Rs. 6-12-6 respectively, while there is a marked falling off at the European General Hospital from Rs. 73-13-9 to Rs. 53-5-4, and at Dohud from Rs. 62-1-3 to Rs. 16-1-9. Govern- ment however refrain from criticising these, as the accuracy of the figures is not wholly to be depended on. 65. Government notice that, according to the statement just referred to, the number of patients has risen markedly in the fol- lowing hospitals:14 66. The instances where there is an increase tend to impress Government with the competence and popularity of the Medical Officers in charge. One cause of the falling off at Surat is said to be the improved sanitation of the town, though the increased popularity of the Paruck Dispensary no doubt has more to do with it, and this, together with the fact that no operations were performed during the year, confirms the belief that the management has been unsatis- factory. The Broach Hospital was in charge of three officers, and to the failing health of one of them the decreased efficiency of the hospital is attributable. The explanation of the Aden figures appears to be that 2,770 in 1871-72 includes both in-door and out- door patients. If this be so, there is a net decrease of 604 patients. The falling off at the Sassoon Hospital appears due to the introduc- tion of the payment system. There is no explanation of the diminu- tion in the numbers of in-patients at Satara or Kaladgi. That at Ahmedabad seems to be due to the payment system. The Sadra Hospital is dismissed by the Deputy Surgeon General with the remark that it is a "small affair which may be passed over without comment." The falling off at Shikarpur is also insufficiently ac- counted for. 67. Government are of opinion that some definite orders are now required regarding the payment system at Civil Hospitals and Go- vernment Dispensaries. It is very difficult to lay down a precise distinction between the persons who should pay and who should be allowed medicines gratis, while to leave it to the Medical Officer's discretion would be attended with obvious difficulties. Too great strictness in enforcing payment at first undoubtedly has the bad effect of frightening away the indigent as well as the rich. For the present, therefore, the existing system of giving medicines gratis to all classes may be continued; but where there are grant-in-aid dis- pensaries in which the Committees enforce payment from any persons, the same rules as may be adopted by the Committees should also be carried into effect by the Civil Surgeons at the same stations. Where also there are chemists' shops, the Civil Surgeons should give only advice and prescriptions to such Natives as sowkars, wakeels, and the like, whose ability to pay is beyond a doubt, great care being taken not to enforce this rule except in cases where the applicants are thoroughly well able to pay for it. As regards in-patients, the Surgeon General has already been instructed that food must be supplied by the relatives, except in special or indigent cases. In- patients may, however, have medicine gratis. Government will now address the other Governments and administrations, with a view to learning what system of payment, if any, is in force in other pro- vinces; and when the replies have been received, they will be in a better position to decide on what further should be done. DISPENSARIES. 68. Fifteen dispensaries have been opened during the year. The total number in existence apart from Civil Hospitals, was 108, of which one only was self-supporting, viz., that endowed by the late
15 Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy at Nowsari; six are supported by Native States, and the remainder more or less supported by Government. The total cost was Rs. 2,21,070-1-3, of which Rs. 1,48,451-13-2 were paid by Government. The grants to dispensaries have been recently revised, on the more equitable principle that Government should not pay more than one-half the cost, or Rs. 2,000, to any single institution. 69. The number of persons relieved is stated to have been 3,327 in-patients and 380,321 out-patients. The first shows an increase over 1871-72 of 236, and the latter a decrease of 4,424, which is attributed to the payment system. 70. As far as the inspection of dispensaries by Civil Surgeons is concerned, to which the Surgeon General has alluded at page 80 of the Report, Government are of opinion that great good will follow wherever the arrangement can be carried out. Government Resolu- tion No. 4589, dated the 2nd December 1872, has directed that, when nothing but the fees and travelling allowance of the Civil Sur- geons falls on the State, the inspections should continue; and Go- vernment desire that in those cases the inspections should be duly carried out. If this condition amounts practically to a prohibition of inspections, Government trust that Dr. Thom will be able to devise some means whereby, without much extra cost, the advantages of the inspections may still be secured. Government will not object to pass such charges, besides the fees and travelling allowance, as may be within reasonable limits. Civil Surgeons should not be sent to inspections, unless there is another qualified officer at hand to do their work. 71. Government think, moreover, that it would be a good measure if the Superintendents of Vaccination when on tour were to be directed to inspect dispensaries other than those at civil stations which may be in the way, and report the results to the Deputy Surgeon General; and they desire, if the Surgeon General or Dr. Pinkerton see no objection, that this may be done in future. 72. The Deputy Surgeon General, Presidency Division, has given a very careful report on the dispensaries in his circle, and Govern- ment hope that the remarks he makes as to the want of accommodation at Bhewndy and Kelvi Mahim for in-patients will receive attention at the hands of the District Officers of the Municipalities concerned. Government will look in the next report to see whether a better re- turn is given of the numbers of in-patients at Bardoli, Baisar, Elao, Mandvi, and Pardi. Looking at the accounts of the various dis- pensaries, they are quite convinced that, generally speaking, where there are few or no in-patients, it is the fault of the Medical Officer, and they will judge of his zeal and proficiency by the results he can show and the reports that are made of him. Now the results at Mandvi and Bardoli are especially bad, the attendance having fallen from 4,058 and 3,520 to 1,631 and 973 respectively. On the other hand, the Assistant Surgeons at Bassein, Kumpta, Kelvi Mahim, Uran, and the Hospital Assistant at Tanna deserve credit for the good accounts that are given of them.
16 73. The Surgeon General has, it is presumed, given the neces- sary orders in respect of the Hospital Assistants at Randier and Hansot, as well as the other officers both in the Presidency and the other divisions, who have been unfavourably reported on. 74. The attention of the Collectors of Tanna, Kolaba, and Broach should be called to the accounts of the towns of Tanna, Pen, and Pardi given by Dr. Johnstone and to the bad water-supply of those towns. The remarks which have been recorded as to the advisability of estab- lishing a small hospital at Bushire should be communicated to the Political Department. 75. The Collector of Bombay should be asked to report on the piece of ground near the Byculla Schools reported to be prejudicial to health, and the Collector of Broach as to whether the building at Unklesur, referred to by the Deputy Surgeon General as being fit for a dispensary, is available as such. 76. Government fully concur in the views expressed by Dr. John- stone, and which are also repeated by Dr. Maitland, that a Hospital Assistant should not, if it can be avoided, be put in charge of a dispensary when fresh from college, but that he should learn disci- pline and practical experience first in a large hospital. 77. The report on the dispensaries of the Poona Division is meagre. In the report of 1873-74 it is hoped that detailed remarks as to the efficiency of each individual officer and institution, with such general remarks as may occur, may be given in the same way as has been done for the Presidency Division. Government are glad to learn that the Deputy Surgeon General found the dispensaries gene- rally well and economically worked, and that he was satisfied with the way in which the Medical Officers conducted their duties. At the same time Dr. Maitland records some remarks on the unnecessarily large expenditure on medicines and surgical instruments, which have the full approbation of Government; they have lately been glad to learn that the Surgeon General has taken the necessary measures to check undue expenditure in this respect. 78. Dr. Maitland's observations on the unnecessarily liberal scale of dieting that prevails under the present scale will, Government have no doubt, receive the full consideration of the Surgeon General, whose attention has recently been prominently drawn to this subject. 79. Dr. Turner's remarks on the dispensaries of the Northern Division are founded almost wholly on the reports which have been made to him by the Medical Officers in charge, and need no de- tailed review. The payment system appears to have been an especial failure in the division. The District Officers concerned should have their attention drawn to the wants noted at Mahoodha and Borsad. Government note that the Medical Officers at the Becherdass, Gogo and Sadra and Bhuj dispensaries are well reported on. 80. Dr. Miller's inspection of the dispensaries in his division has apparently been of a very thorough character. 81. Government cannot undertake to make the necessary addi- tions to the Kurrachee Dispensary which are recommended. The
17 Commissioner in Sind will perhaps see his way in time to having them done from local sources. The additions to the dispensary at Manora must be put off till the Public Works Department have funds to carry them out with. 82. The Deputy Surgeon General should consult with the Civil authorities as to whether no allowance can be made to the Apothecary at Tatta for his services there. Government would be glad to have a report on this subject, with the Surgeon General's opinion upon it. It should, of course, be noted how many other officers there are in a similar position who would have equal claims. 83. The new buildings at Mehur and Larkhana will contribute greatly to the efficiency of the dispensaries there. 84. Government feel sure that Sir William Merewether will give every consideration to the many thoughtful suggestions for sanitary and other improvements with which Dr. Miller's report is full, but which do not call for detailed notice from Government.
