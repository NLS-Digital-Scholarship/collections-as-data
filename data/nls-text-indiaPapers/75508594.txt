ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1903-1904. CONTENTS. PART I.ii PAGES. III.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1903-1904. PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. I.-HORSE BREEDING. Number of stal- lions on the Re- gister. The opening balance, as shown in Table I, was 349. During the year only 2 Arabs were purchased by this Department, the remaining requirements of the year were obtained under arrangements of the Army Remount Department, to which the control and administration of all Imperial horse breeding in certain selected districts, were transferred under orders contained in Government of India, Revenue and Agriculture Department endorsement No. 4822 Sale of rejected stallions. 7. The Sale Roll (Table IV) is unusually large this year, owing to orders having been received from the Government of India to dispose of all stallions not taken over by the Army Remount Department or by District Boards. Castration. 8 Table XI shows that the number of colts castrated during the year by Veterinary Assistants was 1,457 against 2,485 in the previous year. This large decrease is entirely due to the transfer of selected districts and Veterinary Assistants to the Army Remount Department. Number of branded mares. 9. A reference to Table X will show that the opening balance of the year under report was 21,911 branded mares for horse breeding. Only 68 were branded during the year by Officers of this Department, and after deduct- ing those sold, died, and transferred to the Army Remount Department, the closing balance was 5,574 branded mares in non-selected districts. The ques- tion of providing a sufficient number of stallions for these mares, and of continu- ing the system of branding approved mares, is now under the consideration of the Government of India. Number of mares covered by stallions. 10. The particulars embodied in Table V have been confined to non- selected districts. The number of mares covered by stallions during the year under report was 3,190 against 4,127 in the previous year; the reason for the decrease is the withdrawal of stallion power from non-selected districts for transfer to the Army Remount Department. A perusal of the table will show that, with the exception of Rajputana and North Punjab, the number of stal- lions previously located in the non-selected districts of all the other Provinces was less than in the preceding year. Average cover- ings per stal- lion employed. 11. As a result of the insufficiency of stallion power, the average cover- ings per stallion employed exceeded those of the previous year, being 54.34 against 47.75 in 1902-03. Produce. 12. The reported foalings in non-selected districts, as shown in Table V, amounted to 907, giving an average of 10.48 head of produce per stallion employed in the previous year, which is less than the general average of 1902-03, viz., 13.83 per stallion, but compares favourably with the general average of the preceding year. 13. The unreliability of these statistics, due to the insufficiency of the district staff, has in almost every Annual Report been fully represented; but since the transfer of Imperial horse breeding to the Army Remount Depart- ment has been effected, the staff has been correspondingly reduced, and it is feared that greater difficulties will be experienced in the future as regards the collection of these necessary statistics unless some arrangements are made by District Boards or other local District officials to organize a proper agency. Country - bred remounts pur- chased. 14. The particulars on this head will be furnished by the Army Remount Department, as the annual rolls of all country-bred remounts purchased have been supplied to that Department. Table VI has therefore been omitted from the appendices of this Report. Relative suc- cess of different classes of stal- lions as aires. 15. The number of prizes awarded at Horse Fairs and Shows to produce of Government stallions, will be found in Table XIV. The produce of Australian sires again head the list with a proportion of 2.8 followed in order by half and three-quarter-bred English, Thoroughbred English, Arabs and Stud-breds. General state- ment of the cost of the Depart- ment. 16. Table XVIII, as furnished by Comptroller, India Treasuries, shows that the cost of the Department during the year under report debited to India Estimates, amounted to Rs. 3,50,838-3-7 against Rs. 6,87,191-14-11, show- ing a decrease of Rs. 3,36,353-11-4 on the expenditure incurred in the preceding year. The decrease is due to the transfer of Imperial horse breeding in selected districts, to the control of the Army Remount Depart- ment, and the consequent reductions effected in the expenditure incurred under that head, in the Civil Veterinary Department. 17. The prices paid for imported horse and donkey stallions during the year under report, will be furnished in the Annual Report of the Army Remount Department.
3 Maps. 18 Following the practice of previous years, the maps showing the breeding districts and the stands where stallions were located up to the actual date of handing over to the Army Remount Department, have been attached to this Report; but as no Imperial stallions now remain under the control of this Departmant, these maps will in future be discontinued. II.-MULE BREEDING. Number of donkey stallions on the Register. 19. Table I will show that at the beginning of the year under report there were 492 donkey stallions present. The donkey stallions imported during the year, will be accounted for by the Army Remount Department: there were 16 Punjabis purchased in the Indian market and 8 others added by births at the Hissar Farm; deducting casualties and transfers to the Army Remount Department and District Boards, the number remaining at the close of the year was 29: these are maintained at the Hissar Cattle Farm, and are all under 10 years of age as shown in Table II. Number of donkey stal- lions at stud. 20. The number of donkey stallions employed at stud in selected districts having been omitted from Table VII, it will be observed that the number employed to serve pony mares was 127 against 156.7 last year, and the number utilized to serve donkey mares was 8 against 7.6 in the previous year. Cost of feed and keep. 21. A satisfactory decrease in the cost of feed and keep of donkey stallions is apparent, as compared with last year's figures. Table XII shows the general average cost to be Rs. 148-6-6, against Rs. 161-9-3 in the previous year. Short note on the class of donkeys pur- chased. 22. As all imported donkey stallions were received this year by the Army Remount Department, they will be commented on in the Annual Report of that Department. 23. The 16 Punjabis purchased by me at fairs and in the districts were powerful, straight-backed animals, and in every way promise to grow up into suitable sires. An abstract of particulars and measurements of these animals at the time of purchase, is given below:4 Produce. 29 The number of mule and donkey foals dropped is 1,936 and 88 respec- tively; the average result of coverings per stallion employed being mules 12.4 and donkey stock 11.5, which compare very favourably with the figures of previous years. Mules purchas ed. 30. As all statistics regarding mules purchased have been furnished to the Army Remount Department, no information on this head is available in this office for the year under report; Table VIII has therefore been omitted from the appendices. III.-HORSE FAIRS AND SHOWS. UNITED PROVINCES. Horse Fairs and Shows. 31. Table XIII is an abstract of particulars of Horse Fairs and Shows held in non-selected districts during the year under report. Those held in selected districts will be alluded to in the Annual Report of the Army Remount Depart- ment. In the United Provinces only one fair was held. The number of ani- mals competing was 129 against 83 in the previous year. No information has been furnished as to sales effected or the number of remounts purchased. PUNJAB. 32. Six Fairs and Shows were held in North and South Punjab. The num- ber of animals competing for prizes was 1,352 against 1,295 in the previous year. Only 4 remounts are reported to have been purchased, of which 3 went to the Police Department and 1 to the Army Remount Department. 28 mules were also obtained at these fairs, of which 3 were secured by Government and 25 were bought by other purchasers. NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. 33. Only one show was held, at which 183 animals competed for prizes against 518 in the previous year. No record has been furnished of remounts or mules sold at the show. BALUCHISTAN AND SIND. 34. Particulars of horse fairs and shows held in these Provinces will be furnished by the Army Remount Department. BENGAL. 35. No statistics have been furnished of any of the local horse fairs held in the Bengal Presidency. BOMBAY. 36. Only one horse show was held, at which 293 animals competed for prizes. 7 remounts for the Police Department were purchased, but no infor- mation has been furnished with regard to sales of mules. HORSE AND MULE BREEDING IN NATIVE STATES. 37. No information has been furnished to this office of horse and mule breeding carried on by Native States during the year under report. It is believed that these particulars will be embodied in the Annual Report of the Army Remount Department, therefore this heading will, in future, be omitted from the Annual Reports of this Department. IV.-INSTRUCTION FARMS. 38. The 2 Instruction Farms attached to the stallion depôts in the United Provinces and the Punjab, no longer exist, as noted in paragraph 52 of last
5 year's Annual Report. Tables XV to XVII are attached to show how the farm animals were disposed of. These tables will, in future, be omitted from the appendices of the Annual Reports of this Department. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 39. The Farm has now been 5 years under the management of the Civil Veterinary Department. 40. Cows.6 50. Owing to the increased price, it has been possible to purchase a very much better stamp of young mule and the probable castings in future years should not exceed 2 per cent. 51. The mules bred from the farm mares and born on the farm are far superior in every way to those purchased in the open market. 52. Donkeys.7 (it)8 and the financial results. The last named is satisfactory as the receipts are higher by Rs. 5,567- 6-3 and the expenditure lower by Rs. 17,023-12-10 than last year. 74. The report shows continued good work on the part of the Imperial Bacteriologist and his staff and marked progress in all departments of the Laboratory. VI.-EQUINE DISEASES. Glanders and Farcy. 75. The following table shows the number of cases of Glanders and Farcy dealt with by the various Superintendents and is a decrease against 100 report- ed last year:9 Cleansing of horse-boxes and cattle-trucks. 82. The number of horse-boxes and cattle-trucks inspected during the year under report, is as follows:10 animals, of which 61 are located in the Punjab, 6 in the United Provinces and 8 in the North-West Frontier Province. Table VII (Provincial) shows that of this number 23 were employed, covering 319 pony mares and 162 donkey mares. Cost of feed and keep. 92. A satisfactory decrease in the average cost of feed and keep will be noticed in Table XII (Provincial); the amount being Rs. 134-2-4 against Rs. 156-6-3 in the previous year. Produce. The produce reported is very disappointing. A reference to Table VII (Provincial) shows that only 79 mules and 35 head of young donkey stock are reported as the results of the previous year's coverings, giving an average per stallion employed of 6.07 of mules and 4.37 of donkey stock. This is too absurd; and for want of proper agency to collect and furnish accurate statistics, the incomplete particulars rendered to this Department have to be ac- cepted. III.-CATTLE DISEASE-INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION. Outbreaks of cattle disease, 94. Table XX (Provincial) shows the Provinces in which outbreaks of cattle disease occurred. The return is incomplete as Burma and Madras have been unable to furnish returns with regard to the number attacked. 95. Every endeavour, however, has been made during the past year to collect accurate statistics with regard to the total mortality and I have reason to believe that the figures quoted, viz., 258,419 are more or less reliable and to be depended upon. 96. These figures clearly indicate that if outbreaks of disease are to be dealt with on systematic lines and attempts made to reduce these enormous annual losses, it is essential that our staff, both superior and subordinate, should be adequate and thoroughly efficient. PREVENTIVE INOCULATION AGAINST RINDERPEST, ETC. 97. A reference to Table XXIII (Provincial) will show that very material progress has been made under this important head during the past year. It is to be regretted that owing to insufficient machinery the Laboratory was unable to meet all demands for serum; but the arrangements now made should suffice for all requirements in the future. 98. In the "serum alone" method we have the best and only system possible for this country at the present day. As the native owners more fully recognise the benefit of an active immunity for their cattle and as we obtain Veterinary Assistants of higher intelligence and training, the simultaneous method may become feasible. The experience of the past 3 years shows that the "serum alone" method is an undoubted success in India and until we can discover other more effective means at once applicable to this country and its people it would be highly dangerous and undesirable to change our present system. 99. It is significant of the value of serum when used in affected herds of the Darjeeling and Chittagong Hill Tracts to find that only 3.25 per cent. of injected animals succumbed; whereas in an ordinary outbreak of rinderpest among such cattle a percentage of 90 to 98 usually fowolls. 100. Rinderpest.-390 outbreaks were dealt with and 47,360 cattle im- munised against 42,871 last year; the mortality after injection being only 280. 101. Rinderpest broke out amongst the Transport bullocks engaged in the Sikkim Tibet Force. The serum supplied kept the Force free from rinder- pest. 102. Anthrax.11 103. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Charbon Symptomatique.12 None from Burma. Singaji and Chapara in Central Provinces. Sibi in Baluchistan. Tezaji, Pushkar and Alwar in Rajputana. 112. The classes of animals competing are favourably reported on and are described as deserving of encouragement. The cows at the Sonepore Fair are said to be fair in number and quality. The best of the pure breed represented at the Kalimpong Fair is reported to be "Siri" both for draught and milch purposes. The bulls seen at Lakhimpur Fair are reported as magnificient animals, especially those of the "Parhar" breed. Those seen at Choa Saidan Shah have been described as worthy of encouragement and the cattle inspected at Muzafargarh are reported as "fair." 113. As noted in paragraph 118 of last year's Report, the amalgamation of the Imperial grant for prizes with contributions from other sources, and the meeting of all expenditure incurred from one general fund, renders it difficult to detail the actual awards. This system will be altered and, if possible, the different sources of receipts and expenditure separately shown in future. So far as can be ascertained from the figures rendered, Rs. 3,875 were awarded in prizes from Imperial Funds, and Rs. 3,922 from Local and District Funds; but cannot be accepted as correct, as in some instances no information has been furnished as to the sources from which the prizes awarded were derived. 114. The Imperial grant sanctioned for the year under report, for the award of prizes to cattle, was allotted as follows:13 120. The abolition of the Ajmer Veterinary School and its amalgamation with the Punjab Veterinary College was finally decided upon during the year and the transfer of the teaching staff and students will take place next April, when the increased accommodation for their reception will be complete. With the closing of this school all 2 years' courses in India (with the exception of the Salutri class in Bombay) cease to exist. 121. It is very gratifying to note that the Madras Veterinary College was started in temporary premises in October 1903 in Vepery. A large plot of land has been acquired, plans and estimates sanctioned and when complete, this college should be one of the best equipped in India. Several hundred applica- tions were received for admission, but it was deemed advisable to limit the number to 20 students. All these have been carefully selected and form a very promising nucleus. 122. The outturn of the colleges is unequal to meeting the great demand for graduates and Veterinary Assistants and it is satisfactory to find that the men have no difficulty in finding employment. VI.-GENERAL. Remarks. 123. This report closes a phase in the history of the Department and will be the last submitted on the present lines. 124. Owing to the recommendations of the Horse and Mule Breeding Commission, certain districts were, during the year, handed over to the Army Remount Department, and in future all Imperial horse and mule breeding operations in the areas selected will be under the control of that Department. 125. The handing over and other matters connected with the transfer occupied time which otherwise would have been devoted to furthering the work which has now been assigned to the Department, 126. During the year under report, Major Ringe was permitted to retire and Major Hagger died from abscess of the liver in Bombay whilst officiating Principal of the College, otherwise the personnel of the Department remains unchanged.
