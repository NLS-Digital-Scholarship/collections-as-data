?AN   INQUIRY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA IN H. M.'s 18T? HUSSARS AT SECUNDERABAD IN THE MONTH OF MAY 1871. Date of outbreak. 1.  On the night of the 24th May 1871 a very virulent, and apparently, local outburst of  epidemic  cholera   appeared in   H. M.'s  18th Hussars, inhabiting the old and condemned Infantry Barracks at Secunderabad. Summary of attacks.                                       2.  Within twenty-six hours of the first symptom of cholera showing itself, there were struck down thirty-four men and one child, out of a strength of 385 men, 56 women, and 108 children, and while the epidemic lasted (i.e., ten days, or until the 3rd of June) a total of eighty- five persons were attacked, and of this number thirty-nine died. Of the total of eighty-five attacks, sixty-three occurred during the first three days of the outbreak. On the fourth day, the admissions had decreased to five; on the fifth day, they rose again to ten; but on the sixth and seventh days of the outbreak, the admissions had dwindled to three per diem. On the eight and ninth days no new cases occurred, but on the tenth day there was a single case. Outbreak limited, so as far as   European Corps were concered, to the18th Hussars. 3.  While this terrible visitation was affecting the 18th Hussars, the two European Infantry Regiments and Artillery at Trimulgherry, and the numerous European families in the cantonment, never  had a single case.The inhabitants of the bazaar, Native Infantry Lines, and surrounding villages suffered slightly, but in no degree in proportion to the Hussars, upon which corps the disease fastened with a strange malignancy. 4.  An outbreak of such magnitude, happening at a time when the Hyderabad country and the Central Provinces were practically free of cholera, would natu- rally attract much attention.   With the approval of the Right Honourable the Governor of Madras and His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, I proceeded, as soon as practicable, to the locality, with the view of ascertaining the facts in  regard to the circumstances under which cholera assumed such virulence in a comparatively circumscribed locality. 5.    At the date of my arrival at Secunderabad on the 22nd June, the disease had finally left the Hussars, and the Regiment returned from camp to their barracks on the morning of 23rd, the chief sick in hospital at that time being convalescents from cholera.    I was engaged at Secunderabad on this inquiry, and in a sanitary inspection of the Military buildings and water-supply projects at Trimulgherry until the 6th July, 6.  I may be permitted here to express my acknowledgments to Colonel Knox, O.B., commanding the station, and the officers of his staff, Military and 1
2 Medical, for their ready aid in furthering my special inquiry, and to the Medical Officers of the 18th Hussars, Drs. Scott and Anderson, I am indebted for much valuable information, as to the progress of the epidemic in the Hussars. Cholera history of the neighbourhood. 7. In considering the peculiarities of the local cholera outbreak at Secun- derabad, it is absolutely essential that the condition of the neighbouring territory in regard to cholera, should be noted, for it is I believe absolutely true, that no localised cholera ever occurs which has not a defined place in a general epidemic movement of the disease. Invasion of Hydera- bad in November 1868. 8. The Hyderabad country was invaded by epidemic cholera in the latter part of 1868 and beginning of 1869, when a great cholera wave moved southward from the Central Provinces over a large portion of the Peninsula of Southern India. This cholera was very fatal in the city of Hyderabad and in the Secunderabad bazaar, but the European Troops escaped with but few cases, and no case whatever occurred in the Hussars. Disappearance of cholera in August 1869. 9. This epidemic disappeared finally from Secunderabad about August 1869, and from that time up to the date of the recent outbreak, not a case of cholera had been known to occur anywhere within one-hundred and fifty miles of the cantonment. A death from cholera was reported at Trimulgherry in 1870, but the history of the case made it very doubtful, whether the death had been correctly described. Progress of epidemic wave to the south of the Deccan. Oscillation, or back- ward movement of cholera wave in 1870-71 10. The epidemic of 1869 passed on gradually to the extreme south of the Peninsula. In the cholera report for 1870, I have shown, in detail, the progress of the epidemic in the Southern Provinces. At the end of 1870, there was cholera in the Trichinopoly, Coimbatore, and Malabar Districts; and early in January 1871, there was an indication of an oscillation of the cholera wave of the south, that is, after occupying the extreme south of the Peninsula and Ceylon, it began to travel northwoards again along the Western Coast, and also in the centre of the Peninsula. Cholera in Kurnool District in January 1871. 11. This northward movement of cholera, especially in the districts which had been newly invaded from the north in 1869, was observ- able in several directions about the same time. In January some pilgrims returning to Hyderabad from Trichinopoly, where cholera was prevailing, suffered an attack in the Kurnool District, and some villagers who had been brought in contact with the pilgrims took the disease and died, but the outbreak in this case was confined to three small villages of the Kurnool District, and the disease did not spread beyond them. Outbreak at Calastry in February during a festival. 12. In February cholera broke out in a severe form at Calastry, in North Arcot, during a festival held there. From this focus it cer- tainly spread to the town of Cuddapah, where in March and April it caused 320 deaths. 13. The evidence regarding the introduction of cholera into Cuddapah from Calastry is recorded at page 87 of my Proceedings for February and March 1871. Extension of the disease northward through Nellore and Kistna Districts in April and May 1371, 14. The epidemic spread northwards also through the Nellore District and especially in the towns and villages along the great northern road. I have had a sketch map of the districts prepared, show- ing some of the principal places at which cholera appeared during April and May. The spelling of the native village
?3 names in the returns submitted to me by the Revenue authorities often differs so much from the names printed in the ordnance map, that I have not been able to recognize all the places where cholera appeared, but enough are indicated in the accompanying map to show the northward progress of cholera in April and May. Northward extension of cholera observed in Nellore in April, and in Kistna in May. Virulence of cholera in Nundigama Talook on the Nizam's frontier early in May. 15. On referring to the daily death report of cholera, I find that, while the disease was active in the Nellore District in the month of April, it did not become so in the Kistna District to the north- ward until the month of May. In this month the intensity of cholera was most marked in the Nundigama Talook, which adjoins the Nizam's country. Out of a total of 120 cholera deaths in the Kistna District in May, eighty-five occurred in the Nundigama Talook. In the town of Juggiapett, which stands on the Nizam's frontier, there were eighteen cholera deaths in May. Epidemic disease began there apparently on the 8th of the month. This town is only a little more than 100 miles from Secunderabad, and is on the high road of traffic between Hyderabad and Masulipatam on the Eastern Coast. From another village in the Nundigama Talook, "Pendala" (not marked on the map) there were reported twenty-eight cholera deaths in May. Disease imported into Secunderabad along eas- tern road. 16. Beyond the frontier talook of Nundigama there are no records to show the daily advance of cholera along the high road towards Hyderabad, but it is a fact beyond all question that, so far as Secunderabad is concerned, the disease was introduced along this eastern road. History of earliest known cases in Secun derabad. Extract from Dr. Bar- clay's Official Diary. 17. We have seen the disease established at Juggiapett, about 100 miles distant from Secunderabad on the east, on the 8th May. On the 20th May three travellers, who had passed over this eastern road, died of cholera in a chuttrum near "James' bazaar," the most densely populated part of Secunderabad. The circumstances attending these cases are thus described by Dr. C. Barclay, Deputy Inspector- Greneral of Hospitals, Indian Medical Department, in his official diary, under date the 22nd May:- "On Saturday evening (20th May) received a letter from the Cantonment Magistrate, stating that two or three deaths from diarrha had lately occurred in the bazaar, and requesting to be fur- nished with some astringent pills for distribution to the different Police Stations. "Received at the same time from the Medical Officer, Civil Dispensary, information of three fatal cases of purging, with vomiting, having just occurred in a chuttrum, near James' bazaar, among a company of Banyas, who arrived on the 18th from the village of Buchampett on the Masulipatam road, said to be sixty miles distant. These cases were seen by the Dispensary Dresser, who suspected them to be cholera. Their exact nature, however, appears to be doubtful. No cholera is known to exist in the town or station. None has been reported any- where in the neighbourhood, and the Banyas state that they neither saw nor heard of any on the road. It has been judged more prudent, however, (to prevent needless alarm) to return these cases as "diarrha," taking, however, the same precautions as if they were cholera. The clothes of the deceased were burnt, and the chuttrum which I visited this morning, has been thoroughly
?4 cleaned and limewashed. Communicated with the Cantonment Magistrate on the above subject, and made an appointment to meet him to-morrow morning, for the purpose of considering what arrangements should be adopted in the event of cholera making its appearance. " Pills have, in the meantime, been supplied for distribution to the Police Stations." 18. This extract from Dr. Barclay's diary will show most clearly that the attention of the cantonment authorities had been directed to the presence of a fatal form of diarrha, suspiciously resembling cholera, as early as the 20th May. The annexed extract from the cantonment register of deaths will show the dates of the fatal " diarrha " cases in the bazaar :- Deaths from Diarrha.   MAY 1871.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Secunderabad Cantonment    1 1 1 1             1 4  1      From personal inquiry made of the Dispensary Hospital Assistant, who saw the three travellers on the 20th May, I have no doubt whatever that they were labouring under malignant cholera. One man had already died, and two were in a condition of fatal collapse when the Hospital Assistant saw them. The history of the remainder of the Banyas is not obtainable. It is supposed that they left the bazaar after the death of their comrades. Information of the movement of cholera furnished by Sanitary Commissioner to the heads of the Medical Department. 25th May. 31st May 19. For the last eighteen months my office has furnished to the heads of the British and Indian Medical Departments a daily report of all cholera deaths notified by the Police throughout the Madras Presidency, and the fact of the outbreak of cholera in the Nundigama Talook of the Kistna District, which is traversed by the main road from Hyderabad to   the  Eastern  Coast, was brought under the observation of the heads of the Medical Department, in the daily memoranda furnished on the dates as per margin. 20.  The object in sending these daily memoranda of cholera deaths was that the heads of the Medical Department might be in a position to warn their administrative and executive officers of the probable movement of cholera, so as to be prepared for outbreaks, when cholera might be advancing in the direction of Military Stations.    Owing to the dilatory proceedings of the police,   the report of deaths from cholera at Juggiapett on the 8th May and following dates, only reached my office on the 25th May, or after the disease had become established in Secunderabad, consequently no  warning could be given to the Military Authorities there of the impending danger. 21.  With our existing knowledge of the laws regarding the development of cholera, it is not practicable to foretell, with accuracy, what particular line of country an epidemic movement may take.    My attention has hitherto been chiefly taken up in tracing the course of the great invading waves that come down to us from the north, and the oscillation or backward flow of a cholera wave,
?5 until the present year, I have had no opportunity of studying. It certainly did not occur to me, that the northward movement of cholera, both along the Eastern and Western Coasts in the early months of 1871, was significant of danger to the area of the Deccan table-lands. 22. The experience, however, of the present outbreak, shows that the back- ward movement of a cholera wave is not easily defined. We know too little of the laws which determine its progress, to say what places are, or are not, liable to be attacked. Villages and towns along the high roads of communication in Nel- lore and Kistna Districts affected. 23. As a matter of fact, a glance at the sketch map of the Nellore and Kistna Districts will show that the villages and towns along the high ways of communication were particularly singled out for attack. Cholera introduced in- to Secunderabad bazaar before the Military au- thorities knew of its existence on the eastern road. 24. Unhappily the introduction of cholera into the town of Secunderabad along this eastern road was actually accomplished before the Civil or Military authorities had any knowledge of the existence of the disease on the tract. The travellers alluded to by Dr. Barclay arrived on the 18th May apparently in good health, and were not seized with the active symptoms of cholera until the 20th. No quarantine regulations (except such as would systematically detain every traveller outside the cantonment for a definite space of time) could have pre- vented these people from entering the town, and possibly bringing in with them the seeds of the disease. Extension of epidemic to residents of Secunder- abad. 25. On the day following the seizure of these three travellers by cholera, (Sunday the 21st), a case occurred in the village called the Picket or "Chota Mulkapoor." The death was reported to the Assistant Quartermaster-General to be due to cholera. The Senior Apothecary of the Cantonment Hospital was sent at once to investi- gate the matter. It does not appear that he saw the patient alive or dead, but he concluded, from the results of his inquiries, that the case was not one of true cholera. Dr. Barclay remarks, under date the 23rd May, in his diary, with reference to this case:-" The house in which the death occurred had been cleaned and leeped, and the whole village was found scrupulously clean. The clothing of the deceased was buried with him. The further precaution was taken of having the house disinfected." 26. On the 22nd May the wife of a Sepoy in the 24th N. I., in the " Tarbund Lines," was seized with diarrha, which, on the 24th instant, lapsed into genuine cholera. Detention of cholera- etricken travellers on 23rd May, at a Tillage near the Hussar Bar- racks. 27. On the evening of the 23rd May, information reached the Medical Officer of the 3rd Regiment N. I. that cholera had appeared amongst some cart drivers, just beyond the village of Chilkulgoodum where the camp had halted. On proceeding to the spot Dr. Martin found two men labouring under unmistakeable symptoms of cholera. " With some difficulty he extracted from the assembled cart drivers the information that on their way from Masulipatam, near the Kistna river, they had been attacked by the disease, and lost several of their number." (Dr. Barclay's diary, 24th May 1871.) 2
?6 Position of village where the cholera camp existed in reference to barracks. 28. This village of Chilkulgoodum lies within half a mile of the Hussar Barracks and Hospital, somewhat to the south and east. The main road from Masulipatam runs just to the north of the Hussar Barracks, but the bullock carts, and native traffic generally, pass by a short cut to the Secunderabad bazaar along a road to the south of the barracks, which road runs close by the horsekeepers' lines of the Hussars, through the village of Chilkulgoodum. It was just outside of this village that the cart drivers had halted on the 23rd May with unmistakeable cases of cholera in their camp. The village, it may be added, is in close proximity to the barracks, hospital, horse lines, and horsekeepers' huts of the 18th Hussars. Action taken by Mili- tary authorities on dis- covery of cholera close to the barracks. 29. In order to show the action taken by the local authorities on the discovery of cholera so near to the cantonment, I again quote from Dr. Barclay's official diary:- "Wednesday 24th.-Visited Hospital of the 3rd L. I. in the morning. Was here informed by the Hospital Assistant (the Medical Officer, who shortly after reported to the same effect not being present, the last evening, 23rd) hearing a report of there being cholera in a bandy encampment just beyond Chilkulgoodum village, he went to the place and found two men with unmistakeable symptoms of the disease. With some difficulty he extracted from the bandymen the information that on their way from Masulipatam, near the Kistna, they had been attacked by the disease, and had lost several of their number. "Measures were immediately taken, in concert with the Assistant Quarter- master-General and the Assistant Magistrate (the Cantonment Magistrate being absent from the station to-day) to stop all ingress, in the meantime, from the affected quarter, and a meeting has been arranged for to-morrow morning at Chilkulgoodum to determine what further arrangements should be adopted. Called on the Deputy Inspector-General, British Medical Service, and not finding him at home, wrote to inform him of what had occurred. In reply he has kindly volunteered to join in our deliberation to-morrow morning. "Wrote, also, to all the Medical Officers of this department, acquainting them with the threatened danger, and requesting them to be on the alert." Her Majesty's Birth- day. Parade of troops on 24th May. 30. The morning of the 24th May being the Queen's birth-day, the whole of the troops in garrison, European and Native, appeared on the general parade ground. The morning was said to have been tolerably cool, and indeed up to this time there had been very little of really hot weather, such as is seasonable in the Deccan in the month of May. The 18th Hussars, being nearer home than the Infantry Regiments at Trimulgherry, was not kept out late, or exposed unduly to the sun, in consequence of this birth-day parade. No men fell out during the parade, and the health of the Corps at the time was such as to excite no uneasiness. The sick list was rather heavy, being upwards of eight per cent, of strength. There were 32 men in hospital on the morning of the 24th. There was no unusual prevalence of fevers or bowel complaints. Only one case of diarrha (a case of long standing) was in hospital, and none of dysentery. A man had been admitted a day or two before for sunstroke, and there were three cases of
?7 simple " continued " fever, and one of ague under treatment. The diseases were principally those of debility. 31. The following table shows the strength of men, women and children, and the numbers in hospital on the 24th May, with their respective diseases :- Her Majesty's 18th Hussars, Present State 24th May. ____ Strength.

Diarrhoea (choleraic)in residents of cantonment on 24th May. 32. Although the troops up to this time had exhibited no signs of the taint of cholera, it is clear that cholera influences were already active in the station. I have been informed, by one of the sufferers, that two European officials, spectators of the birth- day parade on the morning of the 24th, were seized with sudden and unaccountable diarrha while on the ground. Outbreak in Bazaar on 24th May. 33. In the course of the day and evening of the 24th there occurred five cholera seizures and two deaths in the Secunderabad bazaar, but the facts were not actually reported until the next morning. State of weather on 24th May and subse- quently. Wind steady from the north-west, a direction in which there was no cholera existing. 34. The day of the 24th May is said to have been very close and sultry. The meteorological record, kept in the station by Surgeon C. Cooper, does not, however, indicate that the temperature was very different to that of the preceding and succeeding days. The maximum heat registered was 106, and the minimum 79. Clouds, thunder and lightning, dust-storms, rain, and sometimes hail are common in the Deccan just prior to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, but there had been no rain in the station since the 3rd May, when ?14 inch was registered. There had, in fact, been a remarkable absence of electrical disturbance in the atmosphere preceding the outbreak. The wind from the 3rd to the 24th blew strongly from the north-west, a direction in which it was quite certain that no cholera existed. On the 26th the wind changed round to the south and became variable until the setting in of the south-west monsoon, which broke on the 10th June, accom- panied, however, by but a very slight rainfall-(See Appendix V). Inquiry failed to elicit any facts as to use of dubious food or drink on 24th May. 35. The Queen's birth-day in Military stations is kept as much as possible a holiday. On inquiry I cannot learn that there was anything peculiar in the food or drink of the Hussars on that day. Whether any of the subsequent victims to cholera had visited
8 the Chilkulgoodum village on the 23rd, or had come in contact with the cholera- stricken cart drivers, or had used palm toddy collected in this village, there is no evidence to show. The village lies so close to the Hussar Barracks and Stables, that it would be rather remarkable if some men of the Corps had not visited, or passed through it, during the time the bandymen were suffering from cholera. In reply to direct queries on the subject, the Medical Officers of the Corps assert that there was nothing peculiar in the food or drink issued on the 24th, that there was no extra consumption of liquor from the canteen, and no drunkenness in the Regiment on that day. First attack in Hussars, a patient in Hospital. 36. The first person in the Hussar Regiment known to have been attacked by cholera symptoms was a patient in hospital, who was convalescing from fever. This man was seized with choleraic purging at 10 P.M. on the night of the 24th May, but did not report the circumstance until another man had been admitted with cholera. Following very rapidly on the first case two other men, in different barrack rooms, viz., in blocks 6 and 8, were seized and brought to hospita learly in the morning of the 25th May. The fourth case came from the family quarters. Rapid increase of attacks throughout the 25th May. Removal of entire Corps to camp within twenty-six hours of occurrence of first case. 37. On the occurrence of these cases, arrangements were promptly made for vacating the barrack rooms and hospital ward, in which they had occurred, and the preparation of a camp, into which to move the whole or part of the Regiment, was decided upon. During the day and night of the 25th, the cholera admissions from the barracks occurred with such rapidity that it was evident the men had been exposed to a most virulent form of cholera poisoning, and the Medical authorities consequently advised the immediate removal of the whole Regiment, men women, and children, into camp. The ground selected was about nine miles distant in a north-east direction, and within twenty-six hours of the occurrence of the first cholera case, on the morning of the 26th May the whole Corps, including sick in hospital, was under movement to the cholera camp at Vinagrom. Thirty-five attacks in the first 26 hours. 38. So surely, however, had the cholera virus done its work, that in these twenty-six hours no fewer than thirty-four men and one child had been attacked, while in the next twenty-four hours eighteen additional admissions occurred in the encamped Regiment. The cases attacked before the removal of the Regiment were left behind in the Regimental Hospital under the charge of Assistant Surgeon Dr. Anderson. Sudden onslaught and rapid death of epidemic in the Hussars. 39. The whole stress of the epidemic, it will be seen, fell upon the Regiment during the first three or four days. It is true that several cases occurred on the 4th and 5th days of the outbreak, but cholera was practically at an end in the Corps four days after the removal to camp. From the enormous proportion of attacks on the first, second, and third days of the outbreak, it would seem as if the cholera influence had struck the Regiment by a single blow, the effects appearing subsequently according to the idiosyncrasies of the individuals exposed to it. EuropeanInfantry and Artillery at Trimulgher- ry not affected. 40. While the Hussar Regiment was experiencing this intensified visitation of cholera, the Infantry and Artillery at Trimulgherry were in the enjoyment of their normal health. We have already seen that cholera influences were active in the Native Bazaar
9 Extension of cholera in Native Bazaars of Secunderabad after 24th May. of Secunderabad as early as, and probably prior to, the 20th May. On the 24th, the day preceding the memorable outbreak in the Hussar Regiment, there were five attacks and two deaths in the bazaar, and four attacks in a village adjacent to the cantonment. On the 25th there were six fresh attacks only reported in the natives of the cantonment, but on the 25th and 26th, respectively, there were twelve and thirteen new attacks. The disease gradually extended to the villages and bazaars in the neighbourhood. It reached the city of Hyderabad, five miles distant, only on the 6th June. Prolongation of e pide, mic amongst the Native population. 41. While the epidemic in the Hussars was practically at an end by the fifth day, it was not so in the Native town. The disease continues in the native portions of the cantonment and adjacent villages to the present time, and up to the 23rd July there had been reported a total of 252 cases and 117 deaths, out of a popula- tion of from 40,000 to 50,000 persons. The disease continued for some weeks in the native town of Hyderabad, and became rather general in villages to the northward. Extension of disease to Native villages about Trimulgherry, and isola- ted attacks in European troops there. 42. From some affected villages close to the barracks at Trimulgherry the disease appears to have spread to the Royal Artillery sta- tioned in the double-storied barracks. Two Artillery men were attacked and died on the 25th of June, but cholera had been severe in a Native village close by, for some weeks previous to these attacks. A case subsequently occurred in the 2-24th Regiment occupying the barracks within the entrenchment, and another in Her Majesty's 76th Regiment, but up to this time there has happily been no further extension of the disease to the European community of Trimulgherry. 43. The object of the present inquiry has been to ascertain the circum- stances under which cholera became so intensified in the Hussar Regiment, while the Officers of the Corps, the European residents of the Cantonment, and the large European force at Trimulgherry (averaging 1,793 strong) gave little or no evidence of having been exposed to the special contagium of the disease. 44. In pursuing this inquiry it will be proper to take into account every circumstance that might have influenced the local development of the disease in the Hussars, and to state the facts as clearly as possible, without reference to theoretical considerations. Health of Hussars impaired by long resi- dence at Secunderabad. 45. The 18th Hussars have resided for nearly six years in Secunderabad, whereas no other European Corps present has occupied the station for half that time. The health of the Regiment, according to Surgeon Clery and Assistant Surgeon Scott, has considerably deteriorated of late. In 1869 there was a good deal of sickness. The latter Officer describes the men as anemic at the end of the hot weather of 1871, and having " a washed-out appearance." It seems clear that the deaths and invaliding of the Hussars have been in higher ratios than those of the 17th Lancers, formerly occupying the same barracks. The following statistics will show the yearly admissions, deaths, and invaliding during the time a Cavalry Corps has been stationed in the old barracks, Secunderabad:- 3

On the whole it cannot be said that the 18th Hussar Regiment has been healthy during the time of its residence at Secunderabad. The climate, at its best, is treacherous, and this, and other causes, seem to have predisposed the older residents amongst the Hussars to suffer unduly from the cholera outbreak. The old barracks at Secunderabad, though proved to be unhealthy, not notorious for cholera outbreaks.  47. During its residence at Secunderabad the Hussar Regiment has occupied the old condemned Infantry Barracks, the scene in former days of many a virulent epidemic of the worst form of dysentery, but, so far as I can ascertain, never a notorious locality for cholera. Fevers, hepatic diseases, and dysenteries have always been the chief causes of mortality in the old barracks. Cholera in fact amongst the European troops in barracks, was never a formidable disease. Barracks and site condemned. 48. These barracks, I need not stop here to repeat, have been officially declared unfitted for the habitation of European troops, so long ago as 1852. Notwithstanding their condemnation by a committee in that year, they have never ceased to be occupied up to the present time. The great augmentation of the European force of the station has, in a measure, necessitated the continuance of their occupation. The arrangements sanctioned by the Government of India contemplated the erection of entirely new Cavalry Barracks on a fine site to the north of Trimulgherry. Considerable progress had already been made in the erection of two of the six blocks, when in 1869, further expenditure on Military buildings was suddenly stopped. Recent improvements of the old barracks. 49. The old Infantry Barracks of Secunderabad, though occupying a most faulty site, lying in a hollow, and surrounded on three sides by higher ground, have undergone many improvements since the date when Government first decided to abandon them. As barracks for a full Regiment of Infantry, they were much overcrowded, but the space affords more than ample accommodation for a Cavalry Regiment, according to established strength. Of late years the barracks have been heightened, their ventilation generally improved, and the surrounding walls and subsidiary buildings, which impeded free access of air, removed. The barracks stand on sloping ground, so that their natural drainage is excellent, but, as higher ground exists to the
11 north, east, and west, it follows that the site is liable to receive the sub-soil drainage of the higher lands around. No overcrowding in barracks.    50. That the men of the Hussars had ample barrack space will be evident from the following return showing the  distribution of the men and space available on the night of the 24th May when cholera attacked the Regiment :- Table showing Barrack accommodation at time of Cholera outbreak.

So far as the barracks, or their conservancy, were concerned, it is evident that their condition, in the month of May, throws no light on the causes of the outbreak of cholera. 52. The site of the barracks is admittedly defective. Long and sad experience has shown that European troops cannot be kept upon that site with- out unnecessary risks to health and life, but neither the conditions of the site, nor of the barracks, afford any explanation why cholera should have pitched upon the Hussar Regiment for an outbreak unexampled in severity. Conservancy           of barrack   buildings &c., good. Drainage good. Subsidiary buildings defective in accommo- dation, but clean. 53. The cleanliness of the barracks and out-buildings, at the date of the epi- demic outbreak, I am assured by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, (Dr. Cowen) was satisfactory. After the removal of the regiment to camp, some covered drains leading from the wash-houses, and others built to convey storm waters, were opened to see if there were any accumulations of filth in the sewers, but none was found.    The drains contained nothing but sandy silt left by storm waters.    The wash-houses, latrines, urinals, cook-rooms, and other subsidiary buildings are not so convenient or well arranged, as those constructed on the present standard plans, but they were kept clean. Dry earth conservancy had not been adopted in the latrines, but the excreta were removed twice daily. At the date of my inspection the Hussars had only just returned from camp, and the buildings had all been thoroughly cleaned and limewashed during the absence of the Regiment. The general cleanliness and conservancy of the buildings was unexceptionably good.
12 Position of barrack blocks in reference to cholera. Outbreak almost simultaneous in all the blocks but one 54. The barrack blocks, eight in number, are arranged somewhat in the form of a square (as per the diagram in the margin). The several blocks were not all equally visited by cholera. The blocks marked 2, 3, 7, and 8 gave a larger proportion of cases than the others, and the blocks 2 and 3 in particular, were remark- able for the large number of cases they furnished. In only one block (No. 5) which was occupied by a small number of details, was there an absence of cholera on the first day of the outbreak, and the men of this barrack began to suffer on the day of , removal to camp. 55. The following table shows the stress of the disease on each barrack :-                                                                                                           Barrack. How occupied.

And besides the inhabitants of the barracks, the residents in hospital and family quarters were affected on the first day of outbreak. One patient in hospital was seized, and a man and child in contiguous quarters in the first range of the married quarters. Although, therefore, the inhabitants of certain barrack blocks did undoubtedly suffer more than others, it cannot be said that any particular section of the Regiment escaped the visitation. Latrine and Urinal close to No. 2 Barrack (since         demolished) where the disease was most intense. 57. With regard to No. 2 Barrack, occupied by the E. Troop, which suffered most severely of all, there was an old latrine and urinal to the windward about twenty yards distant. These buildings had been demolished before my visit, but subsequent to the outbreak. The latrine is said to have been offensive at times. It was probably much resorted to during the night of the 24th May, being more conveniently within reach, than the latrines to the south of the barrack square. It is possible, therefore, that the inhabitants of the Nos. 2, 3, and 8 blocks may have been more exposed to emanations from a latrine containing choleraic stools, than the other Troops of the Regiment.
?13 Theory propounded by Assistant Surgeon Anderson as to the dis- turbance of old soil in the bazaar close by the Hospital, causing the outbreak. 58. Dr. Anderson, Assistant Surgeon of the Regiment, has advanced a theory to account for the virulence of the cholera in particular barracks. In the bazaar to the west of the barracks and hospital, and only a few yards distant from the hospital, the Cantonment Committee had been widening a road; and to effect this, several old huts were pulled down, and the dbris deposited to raise the level of a waste piece of ground just outside, and to the west of, the hospital wall. Dr. Anderson has suggested that the disturbance of this old soil might have extricated cholera virus contained in it, which would be blown by the north-west wind then prevailing over the hospital and barracks, particularly those blocks which were the most affected. The report of this Officer in extenso, will be found in Appendix II. Theory not consistent with actual facts of cholera invasion along the Eastern Road. 59. I need only remark here, in regard to this theory, that it is not consistent with the actual facts of the introduction of cholera into Secunderabad. Dr. Anderson was not in possession of those facts, at the time when his report was drawn up. Against the view of the disturbance of the soil being accountable for the local outbreak, it may be noted that neither the people engaged in the work, nor the bazaar people living in the immediate neighbourhood suffered, nor did the Hospital Apothecary and his family, whose quarters abut closely upon the locality where the hutting dbris was deposited, nor did one of the detachment of Native Infantry that guarded the barracks after their vacation by the Hussars, get an attack of cholera, and out of thirty-two persons in hospital, the building nearest to the dbris, only one was attacked. Moreover there had been no rain previous to the outbreak to moisten and restore to vitality any hidden cholera contagium in the disturbed soil. On examining this dbris, some three weeks after the outbreak, it appeared to consist of inoffensive material, mostly red, sun-dried clay, with admixture of ashes, broken pottery, bricks, &c. Relative levels of Bar- racks in which cholera cases occurred. 60. The ground on which the Barrack blocks 1 and 2 stand, is at an eleva- tion of thirty-three to thirty-six feet above the main drainage outlet of the barracks. From these blocks the ground slopes away to the south-east, so that the blocks 5 and 6 are about twelve feet below the level of 1 and 2. The side blocks of the square are at intermediate elevations. Blocks 3 and 8 being about six or seven feet below 1 and 2. As regards cholera, one of the blocks (2) on the highest elevation gave the most cases, while the blocks 5 and 6 at the lowest level of all, gave the smallest proportion. It must be noted, however, in regard to block 2 that an old latrine was inconveniently close, and to windward, and that there is a strong probability of this latrine having been much resorted to on the night of the 24th May, by those affected with premonitions of cholera. Barrack well not used for drinking water. 61. Water-supply.-There is a fine old well, sunk to a great depth in solid or decomposing granite, to the east of blocks 7 and 8. This well formerly supplied the drinking water of the Regiment, and was used generally for cooking and domestic purposes. The water on 23rd June was more than forty feet from the surface of the ground. The sides of the well are walled in with stone masonry, and a parapet and paved surface surround it. Water is drawn in a leathern bag, by bullock power, and run into a cistern, whence it is taken to the cook-rooms, lavatories, &c., for use. 4
14 As regards the contamination of this well from surface fouling of the barrack soil, it is difficult to see how it can take place. There is only one damp spot in the masonry lining, about twenty-five feet below the level of the ground, but no water was running into the well from the surface soil. The water in fact is a sub-soil water, percolating through deep strata and crevices in the rock. New well to north of the Barrack enclosure. Water temporarily spoilt by solution of lime, used in steining the sides of the well. 62. A specimen of the water from this well having sometime ago been analyzed by the Chemical Examiner to Government, and reported as containing an undue proportion of organic matter, it was disused for drinking purposes. A new well to the north of the barracks was subsequently sunk, the water of which was favorably reported on, but in walling up the interior, mortar was used, the lime of which dissolving had such an effect on the water as to make it temporarily unfit for use. Drinking water at time of outbreak brought in barrels from a public well on the general parade ground. 63. Pending the arrangements for a supply of good water to the barracks, a system has been in vogue of sending for drinking water to other wells in the cantonment. A puckally maistry and eight barrel carts are employed daily for bringing drinking water for the use of the Hussar Barracks, Hospital, and family quarters. For some time the water was obtained from the large well in the old Horse Artillery Lines at Begumpett, but a native having drowned himself in the well, the people of the neighbourhood ceased to use the water, and at the time of the cholera outbreak, the drinking water of the Hussars was drawn from one of the wells close to the water course which bounds the Secunderabad general parade ground and near the Sapper lines. Description of site of wells supplying drink- ing water. 64. Along this water course, which forms the south-western boundary of the general parade ground, numerous wells have been sunk. The water here, in the dry season, is not more than ten or twelve feet from the surface, and in the rains it rises very near to the level of the surface soil. The soil along the banks of the nullah is deeper and more alluvial in character than elsewhere. In the eastern or upper part of this natural valley and drainage channel, the well water is reputed to be very good. The cantonment burial ground lies close upon, and to the east of the nullah, and in the rains the newly made graves are full of water, which water must ultimately drain into the wells lying at a lower level along the banks of the stream. Cantonment Burial Ground in reference to wells. As a matter of fact, the well from which the drinking water of the Hussars was obtained lies about 400 yards below the burial ground. Conservancy of the groundaroundthe public wells on parade ground. 65. In this situation, and within a short distance of each other, are four wells, two on either side of the nullah and close upon a public road along which much traffic passes between the Secunderabad bazaar and places to the west. These wells are essentially public wells, open to any body who is at the trouble of lowering a chatty to draw water. They are masonry lined, have parapet walls, and plat- forms, though the latter are insufficient to prevent soakage into the soil around. The bed of the nullah close by, and the ground on the margin, is occasionally defiled by ordure, probably by travellers on the adjacent high road. On the whole, however, the surface of the ground about these wells is kept clean. Whatever defilement occurs, takes place I imagine during the night, when detection of the offenders would be difficult or impossible.
?15 Quality of water sus- pected on occurrence of the cholera outbreak.  66. When the outbreak of cholera occurred on the night of the 24th May, suspicion immediately fell upon the quality of the water used, but the theory subsequently advanced by Dr. Anderson, as to the possible effects of the disturbance of the soil of the old buildings, seems to have directed inquiry away from this important subject. Dr. Cowen, Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Hyderabad Subsidiary Force, in his letter, No. 924, of the 26th May 1871, to the Inspector-General, British Medical Service, observes:- "There is a report that the puckallies (water carriers) have been supplying, at night, water from a well which has been condemned for drinking purposes, but as yet we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that such has really taken place." Subsequent enquiry failed to elicit any facts on this subject. 67. The well alluded to as "condemned" was the one described in paragraph 59 within the barrack enclosure. On comparing the amount of readily putrifiable organic matter in the "condemned" well with that of the water actually in use, it was plain to me that the Regiment had, at great trouble and expense, been pro- curing a dubious supply from a distance, when a cleaner water, and one less liable to extraneous pollution, existed at the barrack doors. What the relative con- dition of these waters may have been on the 24th May I do not know, but on the 28th June one litre of the filtered water drank by the Hussars took grms. 00004 of oxygen to destroy the putrid organic matter, while the water of the old condemned well took only half the quantity in the same time. 68. There is really no trustworthy evidence as to the exact source from which N? evidence to show that water had been  obtained from any other source than the parade  ground. the drinking water of the Corps was obtained on the 23rd and 24th May. The suspicion that the puckallies, to save them-  selves trouble, had brought water for night use from a nearer  source than the parade ground, arose amongst the men of the Corps, and was probably well founded, though no evidence could be obtained to show positively the source of the water. The native in charge of the water carts, supposing that water from a nearer source had been taken, would naturally endeavour to conceal the circumstance, his duty being to see that the supply was brought from the parade ground well. There were nearer sources close at hand, i.e., the well in the horse lines, and another near the horse keepers; huts, both of which are within an easy distance of the Chilkulgoodum village, where the cholera camp of bandy drivers was detained on the 23rd May. Either of these wells might have been used by people with cholera, and have supplied the water for night use in barracks on the 23rd or 24th May, but the evidence for or against this view of the question is wholly untrustworthy. It is plain that a suspicion existed at the time of outbreak that the water had been taken from an impure source, though no one seems to have suspected that the ordinary source of supply might have been temporarily contaminated by cholera matter. 69. Yet nothing could be more probable or easier of accomplishment. The Parade Ground Wells all liable to contamination.  wells on the parade ground are all open-mouthed, and  unprovided with the simplest appliances for raising water. They are crowded all day long by people from the neighbouring bazaar, who bring their own ropes and chatties to draw and carry water. The chatties are constantly washed at the well, and any foul matter adhering to the outside would be pretty certain to find its way into the well waters. It is quite possible that chatties from an infected house, soiled with cholera matter, might have been washed at the wells. Cholera had been brought into the bazaar not later than
?16 the 20th of May, and had begun to show its powers of extension in various localities almost immediately after this date, and the bazaar people had begun to suffer before the actual outbreak in the Hussars. It has been said that the Sappers and Miners got their water from the identical well which supplied the Hussars, and that they did not suffer from cholera, but the evidence as regards this point, is not conclusive. There were some cases of cholera in the Sapper Lines and adjoining village. 70. So far as the evidence goes to connect the outbreak of cholera in the Hussars with impure water, we must content ourselves with the following facts:- 1st.-That the ordinary water-supply of the Corps was taken from a well or wells on the parade ground, to which the general public had free access, and that the method of drawing water was such as to render the water constantly liable to contamination. 2nd.-That fatal cases of cholera had occurred in the Secunderabad bazaar previous to the outbreak in the Hussars. 3rd.-That the use of the well or wells in question by persons from cholera-tainted localities cannot be directly proved. 4th.-That although water may have been occasionally drawn from another source nearer barracks, there is no evidence to connect the use of such water with the cholera outbreak. Condition of water in  the parade ground well. 71. The water of the well on the parade ground, at the date of my visit, was not in a satisfactory state. After standing for a short time it deposited a greenish sediment consisting mostly of desmidiace. It had an unpleasant odour of vegetation, and was cloudy and opaque. Numerous infusoria were seen under the microscope, and amba like forms existed in great number. No doubt all these things may and do exist in water without giving rise to cholera, but it may safely be affirmed that the drinking water of the Regiment was by no means free of suspicion at the time of the outbreak, and that there was a very strong probability of the well or wells having been polluted by travellers or others who had been exposed to choleraic influences. 72. So long as water is taken from public wells, which are hourly resorted to and defiled by any body who wants to draw water, it is quite certain that troops or other communities drinking of such water are liable to cholera poison- ing, whenever the contagium of the disease may be existing in the locality. Water used by troops  at Trimulgherry less  liable to contamination. 73. As regards the European troops at Trimulgherry, the only difference between them and the Hussars, in regard to water-supply, was that the Trimulgherry wells were kept solely for the use of the troops and followers. The wells are all of great depth, so as to be impracticable to natives, who draw for themselves, by a chatty tied on to a rope. All the water from these wells is lifted by bullock power in large leathern bags into masonry reservoirs, and thence removed to the various barracks by carts or puckally's bags. Extension of cholera  to Trimulgherry. 74. While the Hussars were suffering from the cholera outbreak, the troops at Trimulgherry escaped absolutely. At a later date cholera extended to the native villages all around Trimulgherry, and, on the 25th of June, or one month after the outbreak in Secunderabad, the Artillery at Trimulgherry became slightly affected. The water in the Trimul- gherry wells at this time had sunk very low, and the quality, as regards putrid
17 organic matter, was not satisfactory. The muddy deposits, in fact, at the bottom of the wells, were every day shaken up, when water was drawn. 75. I entertain a strong opinion that if the Hussar Regiment had received its water-supply solely from the old well within the Secunderabad barracks, this remarkable outbreak would never have occurred. Still, as I have said before, the evidence in regard to the actual pollution of the water-supply is not sufficient to convince those who decline to accept the view that water is the most common medium by which cholera is communicated from man to man. To me it is a very suggestive fact that a small body of men drinking water from a public well should be suddenly seized with a most violent form of cholera poisoning, while much larger bodies of men at Trimulgherry and in the cantonment generally, drinking from wells not accessible to the public, should have escaped. Supposing the public well to have been directly contaminated by accidental circumstances with cholera matter, it is quite possible that the Regimental supply was drawn soon after contamination, and the men may have thus got the poison in a concentrated form. It is worthy of note, in connection with this view of the question, that cholera appeared almost simultaneously in the Regimental Hospital, in the Barracks and ranges of family quarters. The family quarters stand high, and are well above the Barracks, but their drinking water, and that used in the Hospital was brought from the same source. The Regimental Apothecary and his family, residing close to the Hospital, drank the water from the old "condemned" well in the Barracks, and they had no symptoms of cholera. No difference in food  or drink of the Hussar  and other Corps except  in water-supply.  76. Beyond the water-supply, the conditions of existence of the Hussars did not differ from those of other European troops in the Commmand. The food, drink, canteen supplies, &c., were of precisely the same nature. 77. If the atmosphere had been generally infected with the germs of the disease, these would naturally have been deposited at Trimulgherry and other parts of the cantonment, quite as readily as in the Hussar Barracks and native bazaar; but, as a matter of fact, we know that cholera was brought along the eastern coast road into the native bazaar, and to a village close to the Hussar Barracks, and that it was in these localities only that the disease assumed epidemic proportions. The outbreak in the Hussars, however, was out of all proportion more severe than anything that occurred in the bazaar. Character of outbreck  suggestive of infection  at one time and from some comman cause. 78. It is, I think, very significant of the character of the cholera outbreak, in relation to the simultaneous poisoning of the whole Corps,  that the largest number of cases should have occurred within the first twenty-four hours, and that the virulence of the out- burst should have declined after the third day. This is just what might have been expected to occur when a number of persons had been exposed to the cholera influence for a limited period only. They would not all fall sick precisely at the same instant, but at varying intervals of time, according to their individual constitutional powers of resisting the causes of disease. That a few persons were secondarily affected in the camp is, I think, but too probable, and it may be that this was especially the case as regards the residents of the married quarters, who had shown but slight evidence of cholera poisoning before their removal to camp. Disease most severe  in those who were first  attacked. 79. That the stress of the disease, however, fell upon those who were attacked within the first two days is evident from the fact that of fifty-four admissions thirty-two died, or in the ratio of 5
?18 592 per cent. of attacks, while of the thirty-one admissions occurring subse- quently after shifting to camp seven only died, or in the ratio of 225 per cent. of attacks. Arrangements for the  filtaration of drinking water. 80.   The drinking water of the Regiment, from whatever  source it was procured, was passed through the usual chatty filters, which filters are mainly kept in the verandahs of the barracks, hospital, and married quarters. What the actual condition of these filters might have been on the 24th May, I do not know, but as the apparatus differs in no degree from the old-fashioned barrack filter, it is quite plain that the water coming out of the filters would not be much better than when it went in. The arrangements, indeed, for the supply and filtration of water continue to be eminently unsatisfactory. Cholera attacks most   frequent in men of long   residence in the station.   81.  The proportion of cholera attacks seems to have  been, in some degree, affected by the age and length of residence of the men, and  it would appear from the following table that the residents who had occupied the station from four to six years, suffered in a higher ratio than the younger soldiers. The men less than one year in the station, in fact, suffered the least of all :- Strength of the 18th Hussars according to Age and Residence in India.   Ages Under 1 year.  Under 2 year.

?19 Immunity of officers  and Camp followers. 82.  When the Regiment moved into camp it was accompanied by about 1,200 Natives, including horsekeepers, grasscutters, lascars, coolies, toties, private servants, &c. Out of this large strength, it is very remarkable, that only one individual was attacked by cholera, viz., one of the hospital coolies, who recovered. A young Officer of the Regiment who had been much 'exposed to the sun, and constantly mixing with the sick and dying, suffered from symptoms suspiciously resembling those of cholera, but the case was not returned as one of cholera. Effect of removal to    Camp generally benefi- cial.  83.   The removal of the Corps into camp was evidently attended with good results. It is probable that all who were attacked up to the fourth or fifth day had imbibed the seeds of the disease before moving out of the station.     The cases occurring after the fifth day were very few indeed, and of a milder type. Suitable camp accom-   modation for Cavalry Crops difficult to obtain in dry season 84.   The removal occurred during the prevalence of the hottest weather of the Deccan climate.    The camps had to be chosen with espe- cial reference to the amount of water available for the horses, and, this being the dryest time of the year, it was not easy to find suitable ground within convenient distances. Early in June the south-west monsoon set in, and an agreeable change in the temperature resulted. The health of the Corps generally improved while under canvass. One man died from insolation. Two of the sick, who were moved out with the Regiment, took cholera. One of these (a case of chronic diarrhoa) died. 85.  It would be presumptuous for any one, not on the spot at the time of the outbreak, to find fault with the arrangements made for the removal of the Corps from the scene of disaster.    The promptness of the removal of the Regiment,  and the complete provision of all requisites by the Commissariat, Quartermaster-Generals, and Medical Departments were, so far as I can learn, highly creditable to every one concerned. Movement of Women   and children. 86.   In reviewing the past, however, I am not quite sure that the inhabi- tants of the married quarters would not have fared as well, if they had been left behind in their ranges.    It is true that two cases had occurred in the married quarters before the move of the Regi- ment, and that the Officers of the Medical Department were quite justified, by existing regulations, in recommending the removal of the families but, in consideration of the fact that each married quarter could be separately vacated and disinfected as occasion required, and taking into account the discomfort and suffering entailed on women and young children, under the circumstances of a forced march, I think it would be well, in the event of a similar calamity recurring, to leave the women and children in quarters, unless the prevalence of disease amongst them imperatively demanded their removal into camp. It may be however that, if the women and children had remained behind, they would have continued to use a dubious water-supply, and have suffered from this cause as much as they actually did from the camp life. 87.  We know as yet very little regarding the way in which removal from an infected locality assists in staying the disease.    In the case of the Hussars they had to proceed to a distance of nine miles from the station to find a spot where a sufficiency of water existed.   The camp was shifted three times before the disease entirely disappeared.   The marching, subsequent exposure, and discomfort must
20 have been very trying to delicate women and children at the very hottest period of the year. Lessons    taught    by the late outbreak. 88. There are, I think, two very important lessons to be learnt from this very remarkable outbreak of cholera at Secun- derabad. Better system of departmental communi- cation needed. (a.)-The first is that a prompter system of communication between District authorities is needed, so that the local Military authorities may invariably be warned of the approach of cholera when it is known to be prevailing in neighbouring districts. The Military station of Secunderabad being situated in the heart of the Nizam's dominions is badly off in regard to such warnings, as no registration of deaths is, I believe, attempted in that country; still the fact of cholera deaths in the Kistna and Nellore Districts might, if furnished in time to the heads of the Medical Department at Secunderabad, have given warning of the possible approach of the epidemic along the Eastern Coast road, and more effective measures might have been taken for the surveillance of travellers along the road. The delay in forwarding the police reports from Juggiapetta prevented any warning being given. Water-supply requires more care. (b.)-In the second place, the facts should, I think, teach us that the arrange- ments for the water-supply of troops need much more atten- tion than has hitherto been given to them.    To draw water for the use of troops from a well, which may be fouled by bazaar residents or travellers a hundred times in a day, must always involve an element of danger; but with cholera actually present in the bazaar, the chances of communication of the disease to troops are infinitely increased. 89.  In making these remarks I do not pretend to say that in every case cholera is communicated by polluted water.    The poison doubtless finds its way into the human economy by many other ways; but so long as the people of India are so habitually reckless in their contamination of water, it behoves those who are responsible for the lives and safety of British troops to see that every possible precaution is taken to ensure that their water-supply cannot have been exposed to the chances of defilement. 90.  If it be considered absolutely necessary to continue the occupation of the Hussar Barracks at Secunderabad, I would most strongly insist on the need of immediate provision for the improvement of the water-supply. 91.  The new well built with this object has not been brought into use on account of the contamination of the water by the lime used in steining the well.   I would suggest that this well be emptied, when probably all the soluble part of the mortar  will have   been dissolved.    If the   water is  then  found unobjectionable, I would suggest that the well be covered in and fitted with a force pump, such as is put up in the Military Prison at Trimulgherry, and that no water should be brought to the barracks, but such as has been drawn through the pump.    The pump should be worked for several hours daily, so as to ensure a percolation of fresh water through the sub-soil.    If this well cannot be used it would be better to depend entirely on the well in the barrack square rather than revert to the parade ground wells. Retention of the  old Barracks undesirable. 92. As regards the barracks I do not advocate the spending of any money upon them more than is absolutely needed, to fit them for temporary occupation.  Their site is radically defective, and
21 experience has shown that, let what may be done to the buildings, troops occupying the locality cannot be ensured good health. Suggestions for minor drainage works. 93.   Since the cholera outbreak, the drains leading from the wash-houses, have been taken up, and cess-pits for the reception of the used water  constructed;  but  this,   so far from being an improvement, seems to me to be more likely to be productive of nuisance than the old system of drainage. The bath-room drains should be of shallow cut stone, and open. The outfall from the barrack buildings is good, and no water ever need stagnate in them. Completion  of New Barrack and removal of Cavalry    to   new    site advocated. 94.  I feel that I should be wanting in my duty to Government if I did not take this opportunity of earnestly recommending the speedy completion of the new Cavalry Barracks on the par- ticularly fine site chosen for the purpose near to Bolarum. Double-storied build- ings in Deccan climate not essential. 95.   The design of the buildings already commenced is that of the standard plan for double-storied buildings. In the climate of the  Deccan, and with a dry sub-soil such as exists there, double- storied barracks are not essential to health. They are certainly less comfortable for the men than single-storied buildings on well raised base- ments, such as the Artillery and 1st European Infantry Regiment are provided with at Trimulgherry. Whether the designs of the barracks be modified or not, I feel that the best chance of preserving the health of a Cavalry Regiment in Secunderabad lies in the abandonment of the condemned barracks, and the occupation of a thoroughly good site, such as has been selected for the erection of new barracks. Condemn. 96.   I have  entered in Appendices some information obtained from the Medical Officer of the Regiment, a report and diagram by Dr.  Anderson,  a list of cholera attacks and deaths in the bazaar and neighbouring villages of the cantonment, and a copy of the Meteoro- logical Register of the month of May at Secunderabad.    I much regret that so little of positive information should have been elicited during the inquiry, but the facts so far as they have been ascertained seem to warrant the conclusion; 1st.-That cholera was introduced into Secunderabad by travellers pass- ing over an infected area, on the Eastern Coast road. 2nd.-That the outbreak in the 18th Hussars followed the appearance of the disease in the bazaar, and in a village in close proximity to the barracks. 3rd.-That the simultaneous outbreak in the hospital, barracks, and family quarters of the Hussars points to a common exciting cause in relation to either air, food, or drink. 4th.-That there is no evidence to show that the atmosphere around the Hussar Barracks was differently constituted to that of other portions of the cantonment, and the food supplies were exactly of the same nature as those used by other corps. 5th.-That the Hussar Regiment, so far as is known, differed only from the other European troops, in using water from a public well that was liable to receive extraneous impurities. 6th.-That the actual fouling of the parade ground wells by cholera matter, though exceedingly probable, cannot be directly proved.

?26 APPENDIX II. From Assistant Surgeon J. A. ANDERSON, M.D., H. M.'s 18th Hussars, to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, dated Secunderabad, July 1871. At your request I have the honour to submit my views on the recent outbreak of cholera in the 18th Hussars, and forward a diagram of the Barracks, Hospital, and its vicinity. As you are aware one side of a street in the bazaar, immediately behind the Hospital, was pulled down about three months ago, in order to open up the place and allow of a free current of air, and which, in my mind, was the cause of this outbreak, and my reasons for thinking so are as follows:-Namely, the bazaar is, I believe, one of the longest inhabited in the cantonment, and, as remittent fever has been shown to be produced by levelling old buildings, I see no reason why cholera should not, in like manner, be produced. Against this it has been said, why should not the disease have been developed long before this, when the buildings were standing, by the action of heat after the rains; but it is very well known in what a state of filth some native dwellings are, the inside of the houses being seldom cleansed, and perhaps used as urinals, &c., and as it is supposed that rain followed by heat is favourable to development of cholera poison, especially when it acts on dbris and feculent matter when disturbed after having been left a long time undisturbed, I am of opinion that, while the houses were standing, the rain had not penetrated sufficiently into the interior of the buildings so as to be injurious when the sun acted on it; but when these foul habitations were pulled down, and the dbris strewed for some distance along the road, the germs of the poison were there, which being acted on by a few showers of rain, not heavy, but sufficient for the development of the disease when acted on by the sun, which was most intensely hot a few days before the epidemic made its appearance.* You will observe from the accompanying notes from the Observatory the direction of the prevailing winds for some time before and after the outbreak, from which you will see that, up to the 25th of May, the direction of the wind was north- west, following which is the line of the greatest number of attacks and largest mortality. As regards the barracks, the statistics which I shall now give are taken from the first thirty-five cases attacked, and which were left in Hospital under my charge, when the Regiment marched out to camp. The line, marked by an arrow in the diagram, passes through the Troop rooms in which the largest mortality and greatest number of cases occurred. In E. Troop room there were eleven cases, of which seven were fatal. In C. Troop room, which is in the same line and beside it, but at right angles to the current of wind, there were only four cases, and all recovered. The next room, in which were the largest number of attacks and deaths, is F. Troop, where, out of five cases four died, and the room marked on the dia- gram 6th Troop, immediately adjoining this, is occupied by the Band; one fatal case occurred there. In the room shown 5th Troop is occupied by about seventeen men to make more space in the other rooms. In B. Troop five cases and one death, and in A. Troop, four cases and two deaths. In first range of the Family Quarters one man and one child were attacked, and both were fatal. Although, as you will observe, other Troop rooms were attacked than those following the direc- tion of the wind, they were milder cases, and in my opinion may be due to side gusts of wind; but it seems as if the greatest part of the poison expended itself on E. Troop room. The first case occurred in Hospital very slightly out of the direction of the current of wind, and this, although the first case and very severe, recovered, as only a small amount of poison may have reached the Hospital by a similar side wind, and the ward in which it occurred was near the dbris and close to the current of wind. It is supposed by some that the disease was brought into the Regiment, along the Masulipatam road, by three natives who had the disease, but they were, I believe, not allowed to enter the canton- ment, and if this was the cause, why should not the first case have occurred in barracks which is nearer the Masulipatam road than the Hospital, and if infection came from this direction, it would come against the current of the wind, and again when cholera attacks natives there is often a certain amount of immunity amongst European Troops, and vice vers. Every year there is more or less cholera in the bazaars, and which very seldom attacks the troops, and never to any extent; besides I think the few cases in the bazaar, and which were not reported until after the outbreak in the 18th Hussars, and which number is only seventy-five attacks and thirty-two deaths out of a population of about 40,000 from the 24th May to the 23rd June 1871, could hardly have produced so fearful an outbreak in only one Regiment, without some endemic causes, and it may not be unreasonable (in the absence of any other proof) to refer it to the one in question, and I consider it is just possible that on the night of the 24th of May the cholera poison may * There had been no rain at Secunderabad since 4th May.-W.R.C.  Dr. Anderson was unacquainted with the fact, that three men died of cholera in the bazaar on the 20th May.-W.R.C.  This was actually the case.   The disease advanced against the prevailing wind.-W.R.C.
?27 have been in its greatest vitality and most capable of producing the disease, which, acting on men weakened in constitution by long residence in this station, caused so large a mortality. No case occurred behind (to leeward) the seat of the dbris at first, nor did it attack any of the inhabitants of an Officer's bungalow situated in its immediate vicinity, but at right angles to the then prevailing wind. The immunity of the troops at Trimulgherry from the first outbreak, I consider to be due to the then prevailing north-west wind, which would leave Trimulgherry at right angles to its current. Another cause of the outbreak was put down to the water of the condemned well in barracks being used by some of the men, but this, if true, could not account for the first case having taken place in Hos- pital, as the water used there was supplied from another source, besides on analysis the water from that well has turned out to be purer than the water obtained from the Sapper Lines, the usual source. On again referring to the Observatory notes you will observe that on the 26th of May the wind changed to south, and passing over the dbris in question, may have carried the germs of the disease into the bazaar, which was free from the epidemic prior to this date.* Meteorological Observations.
