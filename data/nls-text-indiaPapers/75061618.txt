CONTENTS. I.NOTE This enquiry was undertaken at the instance of the Inspector-General of Prisons, Bengal, with the sanction of the Local Government. The Superin- tendent, Central Jail, Hazaribagh, very kindly made arrangements for a temporary laboratory in the jail and gave every facility for the work.
AN ENQUIRY ON DYSENTERY IN HAZARIBAGH CENTRAL JAIL, JANUARY 19102 Reinfection is rare when the course of the disease has been severe, a pro- nounced attack apparently conferring immunity.20 Water, milk, food and flies have been brought forward as possible agents in the spread of the disease, but " bacillus carriers " are generally considered as the principal source of infection.21 The large intestine is generally alone infected but the lower ileum may also share in the disease. The inflammation is diphtheritic in character, affect- ing first and foremost the colic flexures and the rectum on the summits of the folds of the mucous membrane. Actual ulcers are rare, but when they do occur, each has a floor co-exten- sive with its surface, the edges not being undermined. The liver generally shows no marked change. Although bacillary dysentery as it occurs in Europe is described as an acute epidemic disease, Böse3 notes that in Manchuria it often runs a chronic course and is difficult to distinguish clinically from am3 A superposed infection of nonspecific bacteria may give rise to a diph- theritic inflammation such as occurs in specific bacillary dysentery. Liver abscess is a frequent complication (11-33 per cent., Strong),22 the am4 that they germinated when the fæces of the infected fly were transferred to a suitable medium. He suggested that the am5 these am6 4. DYSENTERIES OF UNCERTAIN ORIGIN. Apart from the members of the " B. dysenteriæ " group, various bacteria have at times been described in causal relation to dysentery. A virulent type of B. coli pathogenic to animals, was isolated from dysenteric stools by Chantemesse and Widal, Arnaud and others; streptococci and. B. pyocyaneus have also been credited with causing dysentery.6 Possibly dysenterigenic properties have also been attributed to several flagellates, Lamblia intestinalis, (Bohne u. Prowazek).2 Balantidium (Hartmann)11 and Trichomonas (Billet).1 It does not appear, however, that the claims of any of the above organisms to rank as dysentery-producers have been established. It is, indeed, widely recognised that many cases of dysentery occur in which microscopical and cultural examination of the stools during life and of pathological material after death fail to demonstrate a causal organism. Strong22 remarks that, (besides amCharts representing the departure from the mean of the average Monthly admission rates for Dysentery and Diarrh7 Moreover, the practice of substituting dysenteric stools for their own more or less healthy motions is not unknown among convicts and healthy stools may be mixed with urine and blood in order to simulate dysenteric motions. (b) Intestinal Diseases in Bengal Jails. In Bengal Jails intestinal disturbances account for a much larger propor- tion of admissions to hospital and of deaths than diseases of any other single system. As already pointed out the term " dysentery " is a loose one; in the early stages of the disease, as also in chronic cases, diarrh8 As shown by Colonel W. J. Buchanan, I.M.S., there had been in 1909, a marked and progressive decrease in the admissions for dysentery (400 per. mille to 145 per mile) as also in the case-death-rate (5 per cent,. to 2 or 3 per cent) in Bengal jails collectively during the previous 30 years; but there still occur in individual jails fluctuations in the incidence of the disease, the causes of which at present remain obscure.

Chart III. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75061699.tif] Mean of average Monthly admission rates for Dysentery and Diarrh9 The following table shows the admission rate under the heading of occupations:10 TABLE I.11 The largest numbers of admissions occurred from among the convicts engaged in aloe-twine manufacture (1.325 per mille), and from among the under-trial prisoners (1,200 per mille). The former class comprises mainly prisoners who are not in robust health and are unable for harder work; the latter are living under depressing condi- tions and without any occupation; these facts might account for an increased susceptibility to intestinal diseases. It is noteworthy that those in closest contact with the sick showed no special liability to the disease; sweepers gave a comparatively low admission rate of 133 per mille while among the permanent hospital staff and the convict sick attendants, (the latter included under column 17), no case was reported. Drinking water for the jail is pumped from a tank near bye, and is boiled and cooled before being distributed throughout the jail in pipes. Even those prisoners who have freest access to unboiled water namely, the out-door gang, (columns 3 and 24 in the table), did not show a high admission rate. Moreover these diseases were not prevalent to any extent in the Reform- atory School, (28.4 cases per mille in 1910 as compared with 4,728 cases per mille in the jail during the same year), which is situated a few hundred yards from the jail and draws its water-supply from the same source. Neither was there any evidence of infection through the prisoner's food which was all served out thoroughly cooked. The strictest measures for isola- tion and treatment or dysentery cases were systematically enforced by the Superintendent of the Jail. II. Methods of Observation. In investigating the causation of dysentery as it occurred in the jail, the following methods were adopted:12 (c) The stools were plated on Conradi-Drigalski medium; preferably a flake of mucus was selected for planting, after being washed in 3-4 changes of normal salt solution. The plates were examined, after incubation at about 37° C. for twenty-four hours for the presence of "dysentery" colonies. (d) In a series of cases the stools were planted on Musgrave's medium also in order to determine whether am13 only. These four cases had from 3 to 6 previous admissions for dysentery and diarrh14 TABLE II.15 (b) Characters of the stools in dysentery cases. Apart from the finding of motile am16 TABLE III.- Showing case-mortality, average duration, etc. (excluding tuber- cular cases). Fatal cases. Cases lasting over 60 days.

(e) Agglutination reaction. The following table shows the results of the agglutination test in bacillary cases:24 TABLE No. VII.25 TABLE NO. IX.26 of the rectum. One of these cases was " am27 TABLE X.28 TABLE X.29 The differences in the reactions of these different bacilli are very striking and are hard of interpretation. The question as to whether such differences depend upon mutations in the characters of one single species or are in them- selves genuinely specific, still remains to be settled. In any case it would seem that this type of bacillary infection is not highly contagious. These bacilli were isolated during the acute phases of the disease only and repeated attempts to recover the bacillus from the stools of the cases during convalescence and, later, while in the " post-dysenteric gang," met with no success. In none of the five fatal cases in which bacilli had been cultivated from the stools during life were they recovered by cultivation from scrapings from the ulcerated intestine made post-mortem. In one of these cases autopsy was made within an hour of death. On the other hand, in the single case (No. 128), in which dysentery bacilli were cultivated from the scraping of an ulcer, the post-mortem had not been made until 11 hours after death.

The nucleus was often visible as a faintly-defined, rounded or oval disc about 3-6 micra in diameter, situated eccentrically in the granular endoplasm ; in many cases it could not be distinguished (Fig. 28). Circular structureless areæ of a grey or faint pink tint, 1-8 micra in dia- meter, were often seen in the endoplasm to the number of 12 or more, the appearance being at times suggestive of partially-decolorised red cells (Fig. 29). Bodies exactly resembling, in size and shape, normal red blood cells were often present also, sometimes packed closely together to the number of 15 or more (Fig. 30). Many bacteria and particles of an indeterminate nature were commonly present in the endoplasm. No definite vacuoles, either contractile or fixed, were ever osberved in fresh specimens. It is interesting to remember, in this connection, that the cultivated am41 2. That in a small proportion of cases only were organisms isolated be- longing to the group of the bacillus dysenteriæ. 3.
