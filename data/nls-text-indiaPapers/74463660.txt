?GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 29th June 1887. No. 1843.-The following observations on the prevention of leprosy by segregation, by Brigade- Surgeon H. V. Carter, M.D., are published for general information in continuation of Government Notification No. 756, dated 5th March 1884 :- " Further observation on the Prevention of Leprosy by Segregation of the affected. (For preceding Articles see the Bombay Government Gazette of 6th March 1884, Part III). Having, in anticipation of the next quinquennial report, received from Bergen a short summary of the latest results of the segregation of lepers as carried out under the Norwegian Government, I think it not inopportune, with reference to recently awakened public interest concerning leprosy in India and elsewhere, to submit the following information. Dr. G. A. Hansen's position as Director of the Norse Leper Department, serves for ample guarantee of the authenticity and accuracy of the statistics subjoined; and my friend of 1872 has added to his obliging communication some data of collateral interest bearing on the etiology of this national pest. First, as to the progressive decline of leprosy in Norway, my previous India Office Reports and the Bombay Memorandum of 1884 will be found to contain all the needful evidence establishing the fact that the total number of lepers officially registered had, between the years 1856 and 1880 inclusive, diminished from 2,863 to 1,382-see, for example, column 9 of the table given in the local Gazette. Of that later total, 617 were lodged in the Government Asylum, and 965 were living at their homes. The three chief asylums are recruited from the country-districts, under conditions already detailed; and the number of lepers they lodge at present is, I learn, ' about 500.' Owing it is understood to economic measures, the asylum- population has of late years been somewhat reduced : otherwise, had the previous annual mean of about 650 (for the decennium 1871-1880) been equably maintained until now, this sum would exactly equal the total of lepers at large, as shown below ; and so would have been realised the sanguine hope expressed five years ago in the words ' by the year 1885 it is anticipated that 50 per cent or one-half the entire leper-community will be isolated '-see my preceding Article, page 3, heading C, column 7.  A detailed statement of the incarcerated sufferers for the quinquennium 1881-1885, is promised so soon as the official reports are complete ; and since the greatest pains are taken to reach accuracy of every detail, some time longer may lapse before they are issued : meantime, the above comment may be regarded as noteworthy, by way of both encouragement and warning. As regards ' home-dwelling ' lepers-hygienically, perhaps, the more interesting and important section to notice, Dr. Hansen has furnished me in advance with the following datum, which concisely shows the diminution outside the asylums that has occurred of late and is still going on, as he remarks 'steadily and tolerably fast.'

And even supposing, as is likely, there be hereafter found some ' overlooked ' cases (see the preceding Article), still the above considerable abatement of disease within so brief a period of time cannot but be deemed both impressive and significant. Adverting now to the whole series of data from 1856 to 1885, it appears that the number of home-dwelling lepers in Norway has declined from 2,628 to 645, or to the extent of 75 per cent., in the course of 29 years. Again, upon closer analysis of the two tables in hand, I find that the ratios of decline at successive quinquennial periods have been as follows :-15 per cent., 13 per cent., 4 per cent-, 14 per cent., 20 per cent., 31 per cent., and 31.2 per cent.; so that during the last 20 years, at least, there has occurred a tolerably regular progressive improvement in the rate of abatement ; and this datum would tend to encourage the hopes of an early practical extinction of the pest. The contrast of such a prospect as this, of the effective eradication of leprosy within the course of 2 or 3 generations, with the past experience recorded of other European countries in which the national plague persisted with infinite aggravations for at least as many centuries, seems to me most striking. I am aware that fallacies lurk especially amongst vital statistics, but I also know that the data under review have been particularly tested ; and in the small and defined kingdom to which they relate, the Government is such as to permit of a far more rigid scrutiny than usual. These facts, then, may speak for themselves ; and as to their application, it may suffice to remind that there are in India minor provinces and even single districts, which individually could  represent the kingdom of Norway as regards the
?2 amount of their leper-population :* this statement being based upon Indian Census-returns, and from my own enquiries in Kthiwr I learnt that much less than the whole truth may so appear-vide Part 1 of former memorandum, page 1.                                                   In such matters as this some error arises de- viously through prejudice, the sick hiding their complaint, and families and communities screen- ing their sick members; the result usually being, without doubt, a considerable distortion or else defect in formal enumerations of the afflicted. Moreover, there are direct obstacles to be en- countered, if measures at all approaching to effective isolation be attempted. So has been and is now the experience in Europe-the harsh old edicts against lepers I purposely pass over- and so difficult has it proved to overcome preju- dice or to interfere with the liberty of the sub- ject, that, for example, only in June 1885 did the Norse Parliament consent to Dr. Hansen's pro- posal that the sanitary officials in the country districts be authorised to inform the leper-sub- ject he must take satisfactory measures against risking the infection of other people, if he be allowed to live at home ..... and if he will not apply such means, the sanitary authority may order   him   to   enter   an   asylum ...... the authorities are not compelled to do anything, but if they choose they may intervene......As regards general sanitary measures (which the peasantry are now being instructed in), improvement must chiefly depend upon the co-operation of the people themselves ..... Upon  these  few   passages, offered as sample, I need not now venture any comment, as to their applicability to India; the restrictions imposed being a sequel of prior re- gulations, and but part of a practical system of segregation. It may, therefore, be enough to remark that, other considerations apart, one ad- vantage to all leper-infected countries which the example of Norway by her sagacious and patriotic legislation presents, consists in their being now enabled beforehand to deliberately count the cost as compared with the benefit of similar measures; for mutatis mutandis there seems no valid reason to mistrust the efficacy anywhere of 'isolation,' as a principle. As to the rationale of 'segregation' or 'iso- lation,' it is to be noted that these two methods are practically alike. There are more reasons than one that the leprous had best be kept apart. From a medical point of view, ideas have of late changed, tending now to revert to the older pre- ference for complete isolation. Thus, at the initiation of legislative interference, the Norwe- *Note.-Owing to differences in the definition of 'infirmi- ties,' the two late Census-returns of the Bombay Presidency do not afford the means of estimating the advance or decline of leprosy here between the years 1872 and 1881. On the last occasion it was intended that only instances of ' black ' or 'true' leprosy should be enrolled, and the total then seems to have been 10,095 (Vide Table XVII, or 10,248 by an enu- meration at page 100 of the text). The local distribution of the disease being, as usual, highly varied, there were most affected in the Deccan Division, viz., 5,774 lepers, of whom 4,015 were found in three of the six districts composing this Division. In the text of the Census-returns, no special al- lusion is made to the example of Norway; and the 'Pellagra' of Italy seems to be regarded as the analogue of leprosy in that country. The distinction between these two maladies is marked, and was pointed out in my second India Office Report-the part published in a handbook of skin diseases for use in India. gian physicians regarded leprosy as a disease kept up by hereditary transmission, and therefore recommended as sufficient the segregation of the sexes apart; whereas the present official Super- intendent works with a conviction that more probably this malady is propagated by contagion, and hence he inculcates the desirability of isolat- ing the individual of either sex. Neither of these opinions, I might add, has influenced the collec- tion, nor need either bias the interpretation, of the statistical data under review. While it is not my intention here to discuss these fundamental topics, I may offer the follow- ing remarks as not unserviceable or out of place. According to the doctrine of 'pangenesis,' here- dity itself may be due to a kind of infection. The discovery by Hansen of the bacillus lepr, inclines strongly to the side of contagion as the effective agency ; both abstractedly, and by analogy with the admittedly similar affection of tuberculosis, in which the known infective agent is a similar pathogenetic organism-see the drawing in my Bombay Memoir. At the present day, most physicians would hesitate to advance the view of a wholly spontaneous, climatic, dietetic or mal- hygienic origin of tubercular disease; and such a view of the origin of leprosy might, on the same grounds, also be questioned. A hiatus, however, exists here; for whilst the conta- giousness of tubercle (suspected in the human subject) can be demonstrated by experi- ment on the lower animals, no such proof as regards leprosy has yet been certainly attained. Dr. Hansen, indeed, writes that he has seen specimens of this disease derived from inoculated rabbits, and that he has the subject now under confirmation. He remarks it appears of great importance that the material employed in ex- periment should be perfectly fresh-' the vitality of the bacilli seems to be less in old leprous nodules;' and, besides, a period of several months must elapse before the results of inoculation can be surely verified. The milder form (so-called 'ansthetic' or nerve-leprosy) presents the characteristic organisms; and as regards the severer ' nodular' form, Dr. Hansen finds these bacilli in wandering cells amidst the epidermic scales surrounding the 'true leprous ulcer ;' they are always present in the skin there. The inter- nal organs of the frame may also be the seat of these organisms. There is, I may further observe, a third form of disease strongly resembling the leprous, which like the latter is peculiar to man, and which has already been made the subject of special legislation, being now regarded as truly conta- gious at all its stages. Yet I note as regards its later manifestations, which alone are those com- parable to the eruptions of leprosy, it is within the memory of living medical men that non- contagion was not only asserted, but held to be proved by direct experiment. Considering, therefore, the medical history of tuberculosis and of syphilis, in connection with what modern research has revealed of leprosy, there would a priori seem, despite many plausible negative ob- jections, ample grounds for suspecting the fell scourge under notice of being transmissible as are the two others. Deliberate experiment on man (the surest test) being impossible, valid evidence must be sought for comparatively, or
?3 else less directly through instances of naturally acquired disease. As yet, comparative experi- ments have proved dubiously; but with respect to the seemingly direct communication of disease to healthy persons living in intimate and prolonged contact with the affected, several such affirmative instances are known; one of the latest, and perhaps clearest, being that of Father Da- mien at the Sandwich Islands.* * Note.-And what shall be said of instances like one coming to light whilst these lines were penned :-A married woman with children, native of Trieste, after residing three years in Bombay (Fort), two years ago went to Europe on a visit to her friends (family all healthy), developed there severe and typical disease during the winter season, was not benefited by treatment, and was urged to return to India for the sake of milder climate: arrived here in a pitiable state only a few days since, and now has no near resort but the ward shed attached to a Native General Hospital. For leprosy amongst Europeans contracted in India, see some remarks at the close of Second India Office Report, 1876. Finally, that the view of the direct communica- bility of leprosy is at least a good working-hypo- thesis, may be admitted upon considering the results of the strict segregation of the affected, as set forth in the new Norwegian statistics; for, except upon such view, no adequate explanation appears of that prompt and decided abatement of disease which these careful data show.
