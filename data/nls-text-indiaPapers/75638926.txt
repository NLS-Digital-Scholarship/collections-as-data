( iii ) LIST OF APPENDICES. Pages. Table no. II.Annual Report on the Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces, for the year 1931-32. CHAPTER I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I continued to hold charge of the department as Director throughout the year under review. As a measure of economy, re- stricted touring was resorted to and I was away on tour for 56 days only, travelling 1,233 miles by road and 1,255 miles by rail. 2. During my tours I visited 15 districts. The stallion depot at Moradabad and several stallion stands were visited and inspected. I inspected 22 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and attended the large poultry exhibitions at Bewar and Shikohabad, district Mainpuri. I also attended the loth poultry exhibition at Etah which was graced by the visit of His Excellency the Governor of the United Provinces, who kindly distributed the prizes. The Secretary of the Mission Poultry Farm, Mr. A. E. Slater, has done much towards the advancement of poultry farming as a cottage industry. He has now turned his attention towards goat breeding and the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and the Local Government have both con- tributed towards these experiments. 3. Mr. T. S. Davies held charge of the Agra Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 109 days and travelled 3,303 miles by rail and 1,192 by road. He visited 41 veterinary dispensaries, inspected the work of one itinerating veterinary assistant surgeon and also inspected 9 stallion stands. Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad held charge of the Allahabad Circle during the year. He toured for 123 days, travelling 3,997 miles by rail and 2,287 miles by road. He inspected 47 veteri- nary hospitals and dispensaries, visited 5 stallion stands, attended 4 cattle fairs and checked the work of 1 itinerating veterinary assist- ant surgeon. Khan Sahib Ghulam Qadir officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, for the whole of the year. He inspected 24 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and 7 stallion stands. M. Tahir Mirza officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Jhansi, throughout the year. He inspected 27 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries and 4 stallion stands. M. Mohammad Ishaq Khan officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Basti, up to July 23, 1931, when he retired. Mr. Lakshmi Sahai, M.SC., M.R.C.V.S., took charge of the sub-division on August 14, 1931. They inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and stallion stands in their sub-division.
( 2 ) CHAPTER II. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. Contagious diseases. Mortality. Table H. 4. In the year under review outbreaks of contagious animal diseases were of a virulent type and the reported mortality from contagious diseases has been 57,357 as against 37,756 in the previous year. (a) Equine. Table II. 5. There is a decrease in the number of deaths under this head, the total being 87 against 196 last year. Six positive cases of Glanders were detected amongst horses belong- ing to Balrampur estate in the Gonda district, which were destroyed and necessary precautionary measures adopted under the Glanders and Farcy Act. One case of Anthrax was reported in the Benares district. There was only one case of Surra and was reported in Saharanpur disrict. One case of Dourine was reported in the year in district Gonda. Seventy-eight cases of deaths from other contagious diseases were reported as compared with 190 cases in the year preceding. This head includes piroplasmosis, strangles, tetanus, etc., and the diseases caused by internal and external parasites. (b) Bovine. Rinderpest. Table II. 6. This disease was very severe during the year and the total number of deaths reported from this was 47,761 as against 25,919 in the last year. The number swelled to over a thousand in 12 districts and in the districts of Almora, Cawnpore and Kheri it went over 5,000 in each. The lowest number of deaths occurred in the Ballia district where it was only 76. Usual preventive measures were adopted and inoculations performed so far as possible. A systematized form of propaganda work is much needed to educate the villagers for the adoption of simple hygienic measures but it cannot be undertaken at the present for financial reasons. Anti-rinderpest inocula- tions. Table III. 7. Inoculations were performed in 1,739 outbreaks and the number rose from 131,532 last year to 173,678 in the year under review. This figure excludes 663 inoculations carried out at the Government cattle farms in Muttra and Kheri districts by the serum-simultaneous. method, as against 144 such inoculations conducted in the preceding year. A special feature of this year's serum-simultaneous inoculations was that unlike previous years " bull virus " was used in place of "goat virus". Demands for immunisation of cattle with this method were received from many quarters but owing to restricted, funds the work could not be taken up.
( 3 ) Iodine solution injec- tion. 8. Iodine-injection treatment of rinderpest was continued with successful results generally in the first and second stage of the disease. An improved form of treatment in the more advanced stage of the disease has been tried but it is only in the experimental stage as yet Foot and mouth disease. Table II. 9. One thousand one hundred and eighty-one cases were reported to have succumbed to this disease as compared with 1,012 last year. The disease made its appearance in 34 out of 48 districts in the province. Hygienic measures and curative method of treat- ment were adopted, where possible, with beneficial results. Haemorrhagic Septicae- mia. Tables II and III. 10. Deaths reported from this disease numbered 5,513 against 6,738 in the previous year. The disease spread over the whole of the province except in the Dehra Dun and Almora districts, from which no reports were received of its appearance. It was most severe in the districts of Bulandshahr and Aligarh where the number of deaths were heavy. Thirty-seven thousand six hundred and forty-seven inoculations were carried out by serum alone method against 49,543 last year. Besides this, 790 animals were immunised against haemorrhagic Septicaemia by vaccine at the Government cattle farms at Madhurikund and Manjhra with satisfactory results. Blackquartcr. Tables II and III. 11. Seven hundred and twenty-two cases of deaths were reported during the year, compared with 1,207 in the preceding year. Three thousand seven hundred and fifty-three inoculations were performed against 11,511 last year. Anthrax. Tables II and III. 12. This disease was responsible for 282 deaths during the year, against 495 in the preceding year. The number of inoculations carried out was 460 against 386 last year. Other contagious diseases Table II. 13. The number of deaths reported was only 151 compared with 439 in the previous year. This head comprises cow-pox, red-water, pleuro-pneunionia, etc., etc. (c) Other animals. Table II. 14. One thousand six hundred and sixty cases of deaths were reported under this head, which includes cases of rabies, distemper, prioplasmosis, fowl cholera and other parasitic diseases. CHAPTER III. NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. Table V. 15. The number of cases treated at the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries was 305,215 during the year compared with 277,312 in the year preceding. Cases supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals numbered 42,582 as against 37,714 in the previous year. This shows an all- round satisfactory increase of work done.
( 4 ) Tables IV and V. 16. Fifty-three thousand eight hundred and eighty-one cases were treated by veterinary assistant surgeons on tour in villages affording relief to the rural population as against 87,272 during the last financial year. The number of castrations performed was 35,288 as against 16,530 last year This increase reflects great credit to the staff for the hard work done in this direction and also that the cultivator class and other interested in animals are willing to have their animals castrated by the new method, and M. Gur Bux Roy, veteri- nary assistant surgeon, Maharajganj, district Rae Bareli, tops the list for the highest number of such operations performed, which was 1,932. Cattle poisoning. 17. Thirteen cases of cattle poisoning were reported during the year from the districts of Muttra, Agra, Bareilly, Moradabad, Shahjahanpur, Ballia, Unao, Sita- pur and Kheri and the accused persons were dealt with accordingly by the courts of justice. CHAPTER IV. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table V, 18. There were 166 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the beginning of the year but an addition of one was made in the Dehra Dun district and that of two in Etawah district in the course of the year and the number came to 169, making a total addition of 3 at the close of the year under review. Grants-in-aid for cons- truction of veterinery hos- pitals. 19. No contribution could be granted to local boards for con- struction of veterinary hospitals or dispensaries on the fifty-fifty basis owing to financial strin- gency during the year. Some applications were, however, received from district boards for monetary grants which had to be refused. CHAPTER V. LABORATORIES AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS. Laboratory work. 20. Four hundred and thirty-one smears were examined at the headquarters and circle laboratories in the year as against 358 in the previous year. Besides these, a number of pathological, entomological and helmin- thological materials were also received for examination. Rare and interesting materials were preserved for demonstration purposes in the headquarters laboratory museum. The smears examined were from various species of animals and they include equine,
( 5 ) bovine, canine, ovine, avian, elephant and hare and the result of the examinations is summarised in brief as under :(6) Experimental treatment of Rinderpest was conducted with "Kaolin" in the districts of Lucknow and Kheri but it was observed that the drug had no beneficial effect when the affected animals were passing through the height of the severity of the disease. It was, however, found useful in checking diarrhoea when the acute symptoms have passed. 23. Four hundred and fifty-one cases were treated at head- quarter as against 412 in the year preceding. A sum of Rs. 1,032-8-0 was realized as treatment charges, etc., against Rs. 940 last year. The cases treated were mostly of special interest or of an obscure nature. CHAPTER VI. BREEDING OPERATIONS. (i) Horse and pony stallions. Table X. 24. There were 50 stallions on the roll of the department for horse-breeding in the "non-selected" districts of this province not counting the districts of Meerut, Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar and Aligarh which are under the administrative control of the Army Remount department for this purpose. Three stallions were purchased during the year and 2 destroyed being unfit for further stud work. Thus the balance left at the close of the year was 57. Table XI. 25. Fifty-two stallions were employed at stud during the year and the covering operations performed by them numbered 1,759 against 1.901 in the preceding year. 20. During the year a new stallion stand has been opened at Budakhera, district Saharanpur. in place of one at Ghatera in the same district which had to be closed down for continual mismanage- ment on the part of the darindah. The stallion stands at Maurani- pur and Lalitpur, district Jhansi, have been closed for financial stringency by the district board. Stallion stands at Maduapur, dis- trict Basti and at Majhauli, district Gorakhpur had also to be closed for the same reasons. A new stallion stand has, however, been established at Mirzapur and is gaining popularity. The Gunnaur stallion stand which had to be temporarily closed and could not be re-opened last year owing to the sudden death of the darindah, has been re-opened in the year under review. 27. It is gratifying to note that continued improvement is being shown by the progeny of Government stallions. Stallion dépôt. 28. The stallion depot at Moradabad afforded rest and treat- ment to the stallions that came in from the district and good work has been done there.
(7) (ii) Donkey stallions. Table X. 29. Thirteen jack donkeys belonged to the department at the beginning of the year and two had to be des- troyed, leaving 11 at the end of the year. Table XI. 30. Ten donkeys were at stud work and their coverings num- bered 208, making an average of 20.8 per animal. CHAPTER VII. FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and shows. 31. Several cattle fairs and shows were held in -the province in which the officers of the department participa- ted. Prizes were awarded to encourage breeding and veterinary exhibits were displayed as usual at the important fairs such as Batesar, district Agra, Dewa, district Bara Banki, Dadri district Ballia and Makanpur, district Cawnpore. Some veterinary exhibits were also displayed at the poultry exhibition at Etah which was well organized. At Dewa, Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Moham- mad explained to the influential zamindars, who attended the fair the benefits and necessity of veterinary aid in carrying cut agricul- tural operations successfully. The question of deputation of a veterinary assistant surgeon from the Bara Banki district veterinary staff to the fair has been settled and the veterinary assistant surgeon. attached to Bara Banki hospital was deputed, who carried out the treatment of sick animals. Arrangements for guarding against outbreaks of contagious diseases were made in all the fairs and shows by the district board staff in co-operation with circle veterinary inspectors and headquarters veterinary assistant surgeons, wherever necessary, under direct supervision, in most cases, of the Circle Super- intendents. 32. The Circle Superintendent, Allahabad, along with Deputy Superintendent, Basti, attended the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition, which was organized by the district authorities at Bahraich in August last. Veterinary exhibits were displayed and the people, who attended the exhibition, were explained the ways of suppression of the common contagious diseases among the cattle. 33. The temporary veterinary hospital annually opened at the Megh Mela exhibition at Allahabad for the treatment of sick animals brought to the fair did useful work and some of the Exhibits displayed created great interest among the visitors and pilgrims drawn from remote parts of India. CHAPTER VIII. PROPAGANDA. Propaganda. 34. Much is desired in this direction for furthering the cause of the department but the question of finances stands in the way, and better days are eagerly awaited. Pamphlets dealing with the common contagious and
(8) non-contagious diseases of animals written in vernaculars were dis- tributed to persons interested who attended the fairs and shows. Lectures were delivered by the subordinate staff of the department at the same time and at other centres, when necessary. Demon- strations by lantern slides or cinema films are, however, considered very important for propaganda work but they cannot be arranged for until the financial condition is improved. Lectures delivered by the subordinate staff at the different agriculture and other schools have beneficial effects on the rural population by way of propa- ganda and are being continued. CHAPTER IX. ESTABLISHMENT. Establishment. Table VII. 35. The subordinate establishment at the end of the year stood as follows :(9) Lecture on cattle diseases. 40. Two hundred and seventy nine lectures on the common diseases of animals were delivered by the sub- ordinate staff of the department as enumerated below, which were beneficial to the rural population for the proper care of their live-stock. (1) Agricultural classes in vernacular middle schools :(10) 44. A scheme for reporting of cattle diseases by village chauki- dars as an experimental measure in three districts in the province and one for the organization of veterinary aid in rural areas have not matured as yet for want of funds. 45. With a view to extend serum-simultaneous inoculation operations, it is desirable to erect a virus-producing centre at a suit- able place wherein goat virus may be conveniently manufactured for distribution in the province, as necessity arises. A scheme for this is under contemplation. 4G. During the year tests were carried out at the Agricultural Institute, Allahabad, for detection of tuberculosis and Johne's disease by double intradermal method. The percentage of positive reactors in the test showed 7.3 for tuberculosis and 2.4 for Johne's disease. Suspicious reactors showed 12.1 for tuberculosis and 1.2 for Johne's disease. Measures were suggested to the Institute autho- rities for the eradication of both the diseases from their herd. 47. Five sanads were awarded daring the year to the following persons for rendering help to the department in carrying out inocula- tions against cattle contagious diseases in the different districts. (1) Jhansi district .. Gaya Prasad, Patwari, village Kerote- har, tahsil Garoth. (2) (11) (3) Veterinary assistant surgeon M. Ghafur-ur-Rahman Khan of Sitapur, for the high standard of work he has performed during the year. 51. In conclusion, I should like to thank my Circle Superinten- dents Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad and Mr. T. S. Davies for the help they have afforded me and for the efficient way they respectively ran their circles, also my Deputy Superintendents for the way they carried out their duties in their respective sub- divisions. S. G. M. HICKEY, CAPTAIN, I.V.S., Director, Civil Veterinary department, United Provinces.

(iii) LIST OF APPENDICES Pages Table no. IIAnnual Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, for the year 1932-33 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. I held charge of the department as Director for the whole of the year under review. With a view to economy tours were restricted during the year and I was away from headquarters for 52 days only travelling 2,542 miles by rail and 745 miles by road. 2. I visited nine districts and inspected the stallion depot at Moradabad on three occasions. I visited the Goat Breeding Farm at Etah, started by the American Mission under the charge of Dr. A. E. Slater and gave necessary instructions about keeping the herds in health and also about scientifically grading them for breeding purposes. I went to Aligarh with a view to discuss horse breeding in the selected districts and appeared before the Public Accounts Committee at Naini Tal to give evidence in connexion with the accounts of the United Provinces Poultry Association. I travelled in the hilly tracts of Almora District for investigation of fascioliasis in cattle where I met the Helminthologist of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. I also went to a village in the Lucknow District and made a special investigation into the causes and treatment of bovine nasal granuloma. 3. Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad held charge of the Allahabad Circle throughout the year. He toured for 114 days, tra- velling 4,169 miles by rail and 2,768 miles by road. He visited 16 districts, inspected 52 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, checked the work of two itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons, inspected six stallion stands and attended five cattle fairs and shows. 4. Mr. T. S. Davies held charge of the Agra Circle throughout the year, toured for 82 days, travelling 3,344 miles by rail and 893 miles by road. He inspected 35 veterinary dispensaries and hospitals and 10 stallion stands. He attended the Batesar fair in the Agra District and 4 district exhibitions. 5. Khan Sahib Ghulam Qadir officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Moradabad, during the year. He toured for 104 days, travelling 728 miles by road and 3,627 miles by rail. He inspected 24 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, eight stallion stands, attended a cattle fair and a cattle exhibition, attended a glanders case and inspected Police Lines horses at Bareilly. 6. M. Tahir Mirza officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Jhansi, during the whole year. He toured for 116 days, travelling 4,406 miles by rail and 611 miles by road. He inspected 16 veterinary
(2) hospitals and dispensaries, checked the work of an itinerating veterin- ary assistant surgeon, visited four stallion stands, inspected Police Lines horses at Jhansi and Cawnpore and attended three cattle fairs and shows. 7. Mr. Lakshmi Sahai officiated as Deputy Superintendent, Basti, up to April 27, 1932, when he resigned. He made over temporary charge of his sub-division to Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohamed. Superintendent, Allahabad Circle, who made it over to Babu Chunni Lal on August 22, 1933, on his appointment as officiating Deputy Superintendent, Basti. Mr. Sahai toured for 14 days, travelling 799 miles by rail and 96 miles by road. He inspected three veterinary dispensaries and attended two horses and cattle fairs. Babu Chunni Lal toured for 78 days, travelling 1,678 miles by rail and 1,079 miles by road. He visited 22 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, checked the work of one veterinary assistant surgeon, inspected three stallion stands and one buffalo bull stand. He also inspected the horses belonging to the Balrampur and Bansi Estates in Gonda and Basti Districts for checking of contagious diseases. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality. Table II. 8. The outbreaks of cattle epidemics were almost quite as severe as in the previous year and the reported mor- tality during the year was 55,110 as against 57,357 during 1931-32. (a) Equine Table II. 9. There was an increase of 11 in the number of deaths under this head, the total being 98 against 87 in the past year. Four positive cases of glanders were detected in the districts of Muttra, Agra, Shahjahanpur and Basti which were destroyed and necessary measures taken as prescribed under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Eight cases of surra were reported during the year and they were all from Naini Tal District, seven being from Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates. There were 86 cases of deaths from other con- tagious diseases as compared with 78 during the past year. This head includes strangles, piroplasmosis, etc. and the diseases caused by internal and external parasites. (b) Bovine Rinderpost. Table II. 10. The disease was a little less severe than in the preceding year as compared with the reported deaths of 43,600 animals against 47,761 of the year before. The number exceeded 1,000 in 10 districts and in the districts of Cawnpore, Allahabad, Benares and Ghazipur it rose
(3) to over 3,000 in each. The lowest number of deaths occurred in the Naini Tal District, where it was only 56. The outbreaks in the Benares District were most serious and extra staff had to be deputed to meet the situation. Inoculations and other preventive measures were adopted as was possible and villagers were explained about taking simple, measures with a view to avert the spread of contagious diseases of animals but an organized propaganda work on proper lines has to be suspended until financial conditions are favourable. Anti-rinderpest inoculations, Table III. 11. Inoculations were performed in 1,649 outbreaks and the num- ber increased from 173,678 in the previous year to 177,594 in the year under report. Besides this number, 531 serum simultaneous inoculations were performed among the cattle belonging to the R. E. I. Dairy, Agra, the Raja of Awagarh, the Allahabad Agricultural Institute and the Abbott Farm at Jhansi. A peculiar feature of inoculations under this method was that class II anti-rinderpest serum was used instead of class I for cross-bred imported animals with no adverse effect, a fact which would seem to indicate that the dose of serum class I may be reduced in the case of such animals with a view to economy in the cost of immunisation. How far it can be reduced remains to be ascertained by careful experimentation in future operations. Out of 511 animals inoculated with bull virus, complicating infection with piroplasma bigenninum was observed in 38 animals (7.4 per cent.), which were successfully treated with trypanblue. There was no complication in the cattle inoculated with goat virus. Iodine solution in- jections. 12. The treatment of rinderpest cases with iodine injections was continued to be experimented upon with about 80 per cent. success in the early stage of the disease. Successful treatment in an improved form in the last stage of the disease is yet to be undertaken. Foot and mouth disease. Table II. 13. The disease made its appearance in 42 districts in the Province and the reported deaths numbered 1,587 as compared with 1,181 in the year preceding. So far as possible curative methods and hygienic measures were adopted with satisfactory results. Haemorrhagic septi- caemia. Table II. 14. The number of deaths from this disease was 6,680 as against 5,513 in last year. It spread over the whole of the Province with the exception of Dehra Dun, Almora and Naini Tal Districts. It was most severe in the district of Muttra where total deaths were 868. Forty thousand one hundred and seventy-seven inoculations were performed by serum-alone method as compared with 37,647 last year. Besides this number 625 animals were immunized by haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine at the Government Cattle Farms in Muttra, Jhansi and Kheri Districts. Blackquatter, Tables II and III. 15. Five hundred and sixty-one cases of deaths were reported to have occurred during the year as against 722 cases in the previous year. The number of inoculations performed against this disease was. 3,929 compared with 3,753 in the preceding year.
(4) Anthrax. Tables II and III. 16. The number of animals reported to have succumbed to this disease was 394 as against 282 last year. One thousand three hundred and twenty-five inocu- lations were carried out during the year as against 460 last year. Other contagious diseases. Table II. 17. There were 532 deaths as reported under this head compared with 151 in the previous year. They comprise cow-pox, liver fluke, pleuro-pneumonia, etc. (c) Other animals Table II. 18. One thousand six hundred and fifty-eight cases of deaths were reported amongst animals other than equines and bovines. They include cases of rabies, distemper, piroplasmosis, fowl cholera and other parasitic diseases. CHAPTER III Non-contagious diseases Table V. 19. The number of cases treated at the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries was 327,878 during the year as against 305,215 in the preceding year. Cases supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals numbered 56,101 compared with 42,582 in the previous year. The figures indicate a fair increase of work done during the year under review. Tables IV and V. 20. The number of animals treated by veterinary assistant sur- geons while on tour thereby affording relief to the interior of villages was 93,183 as against 53,881 in the preceding year. Castrations performed for elimination of scrub animals rose from 35,288 in the last year to 55,285 in the year under report. The increase of work in both these directions shows great keenness on the part of the staff. Cattle poisoning. 21. Twenty-one cases of cattle poisoning were reported from the districts of Cawnpore, Jalaun, Unao and Sitapur and the accused persons, as could be traced out, were dealt with accordingly. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospital and dispensaries, Table V. 22. The year commenced with 169 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries during the currency of the year, one veterinary hospital at Jhinjhak in Cawnpore District was closed but one at Ranikhet (district Almora) and two in the Unao District were newly opened. The total, therefore, came to 171 making an addition of two institutions at the close of the year over the last year's number.
(5) Grants-in-aid for construction of veteri- nary hospitals. 23. Owing to financial stringency no contribution could be granted to local boards for construction of veterinary hospitals or dispensaries and applications received from district boards for pecuniary assistance had to be held over for consideration when conditions improve. CHAPTER V LABORATORIES AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS Laboratory work. 24. One thousand three hundred and nine materials were clini- cally examined at the headquarters and circle laboratories as against 431 in the preceding year. They comprised bacteriological, protozoological, pathological and helminthological cases. Some interesting specimens and para- sites received during the year have been stocked in the laboratories. The smears examined were from various species of animals and the result of the examinations is summarized as under: Positive Negative Total 378 727 1,105 Lucknow Laboratory. 34 92 126 Allahabad (6) Tuberculin tests for detection of tuberculosis and Johne's disease were made by double intradernal method at the Balrampur Cattle Farm, district Gonda, with negative results. An investigation into the distribution of bovine nasal granuloma in the Province was instituted and it was found that the disease has an enzootic existence. Chemo-therapeutic experiments were sucessfully carried out with intravenous injections of tartar emetic and subcuta- neous injections of antimosan which latter proved less toxic and more efficacious but more expensive. Experimental investigation was undertaken on the general treat- ment of helminth parasitic infection of poultry. The various types of parasites which play an important part in the causation of pathologi- cal entities and their relation to metabolic disturbance of the tissues due to defective nutrition were studied. During the course of investi- gation a new species of gongylonema was found embedded in a spiral manner in the sub-mucosa of the crop which was discovered for the first time and as such it aroused great interest. Experiments on the chemo-therapy of the disease were undertaken with various drugs and it was observed that carbon tetrachloride though effective has the drawback of retarding the egg-laying capaci- ties of mature female birds. A colloidal product invented by Dr. Chandler of the Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science, which is said to increase the egg-laying capacity will now be experimented with. Experimental investigation was undertaken on the incidence of helminth parasites in pariah dogs and jackals. About 83 per cent. of dogs and 60 per cent. of jackals examined were found affected with hook worms. In addition, other nematode, cestode and trematode worms were discovered. Mention may be made of a nematode worm Chlamydonema Sp. found firmly hooked in the mucous membrane of the stomach discovered for the first time and has proved very interest- ing in that no species of this genus has hitherto been recorded in the dog. Work on this subject is still in progress in collaboration with the Helminthologist of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, Mr. G. D. Bhalerao and Dr. G. S. Thapar, Reader, Depart- ment of Zoology, Lucknow University. 27. Five hundred and forty-nine cases were treated at the head- quarters as compared with 451 last year. A sum of Rs.1,038-9 was realized as treatment charges, etc., against Rs.1,032-8 in the year preceding. The cases treated were of special interest and some were of an obscure nature. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Horse and pony stallions Table X. 28. The year commenced with 57 stallions on the roll for horse- breeding in the Province excepting the selected area comprising of the four districts of Aligarh
(7) Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Bulandshahr. Four stallions were pur- chased during the year, three were destroyed, one was sold being unfit for breeding purposes any longer and one died. Thus the number of stallions at the close of the year was 56. Table XI. 29. Forty-nine stallions were employed at stud work during the year under report and their covering operations numbered 1,888 against 1,759 last year. The average worked to 38.5 per animal per year. 30. During the year a new stallion stand has been opened at Shai in Bareilly District and another at Mathuranagar in Bara Banki District. The stallion stands at Kamalpur Bakrauli in the Saharanpur District and at Piwari in Etah District have been closed. A new stallion stand at Etah is under contemplation which could not be opened as yet as suitable stables have not been prepared. 31. It is noted with pleasure that the progeny of Government stallions is showing continued improvememt. Stallion depot. 32. Good work has been done at the stallion depot at Moradabad where stallions from districts were afforded rest and treatment necessary after continued work or during ailments. (ii) Donkey stallions Table X. 33. Eleven jack donkeys belonged to the department at the begin- ing of the year ; three were destroyed and one died, thus there were seven left at the end of the year. Table XI. 34. Eight donkeys were at stud work and the covering operations numbered 218 against 208 in the previous year, making an average of 27.2 per animal. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 35. There was a number of cattle and horse fairs and shows in the Province during the year under report which were visited by officers of this department who judged and awarded prizes to the best kept animals and tried to advance veterinary science by lectures, demonstrations, etc. At Kulkula fair, district Gorakhpur, Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad presided over the prize distribution committee and deli- vered a lecture explaining the advantages of scientific veterinary aid in successfully carrying out agricultural operations and also the benefits of the painless method of castration by Burdizzo clamp. At Dewa fair, district Bara Banki and at Dadri fair in Ballia District, he acted as a member of the judging committee. He supervised the work of his subordinate staff at Debi Patan fair, in Gonda District, and also paid a few visits to the Magh Mela cattle fair and exhibition at Allahabad.
(8) Mr. T. S. Davies attended the Batesar fair in the Agra District, the district exhibition in Saharanpur, Meerut, Etawah and Aligarh and assisted in the judging committees in the selection of animals for prizes. The Deputy Superintendents and members of the subordinate staff attended several important fairs and shows including Kakora fair (district Budaun) cattle exhibition at Raja-ka-Sahaspur in Moradabad District, Makanpur fair in Cawnpore District and several others. Necessary arrangements for the treatment of sick animals brought to the fairs by opening of temporary veterinary dispensaries and for guarding against outbreaks of contagious diseases were made in the fairs and shows which were greatly beneficial to the public drawn from different rural areas. Veterinary exhibits. 36. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at the Dewa and Batesar fairs, the Magh Mela fair and exhibition at Allahabad and in the Saharanpur District exhibition. There was a cattle fair at Ramnagar, in the Tarai and Bhabar Estate, district Naini Tal, where also veterinary exhibits were displayed. They attracted a large crowd of spectators who showed great interest in them. CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 37. Adequate propaganda for furthering the cause of the depart- ment on proper lines could not as yet be achieved on financial grounds but with the small resources the department has, there have been some activities in this direction which it could afford. Lectures were delivered by the officers and subordinates giving instructions about the control of infectious and other diseases. Pamphlets dealing with common contagious diseases among animals were distributed and veterinary exhibits wherever possible were displayed accompanied by demonstrations. No doubt they had a good effect on the stock owners but there is yet a very large scope in the direction of new methods of demonstrations which have to be held over for paucity of funds. Exhibitions in connexion with the Publicity Van and rural uplift organized by district authorities were taken part in and veter- inary exhibits and specimens displayed at such exhibitions held in Gonda and Fyzabad Districts created immense interest among the public. Babu Chunni Lal, officiating Deputy Superintendent, Basti, attend- ed a monster meeting of rural uplift at Hariharpur, district Basti, and arranged for the demonstration of veterinary exhibits and lectures in veterinary science in general which created a good impression on the villagers about the activities of this department.
(9) CHAPTER IX ESTABLISHMENT Establishment, Table VII. 38. The subordinate staff at the end of the year stood as follows : Veterinary inspectors .. .. .. .. 16 Veterinary overseers .. .. .. .. 2 Veterinary assistant surgeon incharge Laboratory and Isolation wards, Lucknow .. .. .. .. 1 Veterinary assistant surgeons attached to headquarters and on foreign service in India .. .. .. 21 Veterinary assistant surgeons employed in districts (includ- ing one in the Agriculture College, Cawnpore) .. 177 Total .. 217 Casualty staff. 39. There was one case of death and five of retirements on amongst superannuation pension during the year. Foreign scholarships. 40. No foreign scholarships were awarded for veterinary education out of India. Two of the remaining five scholars, Messrs. H. B. Shahi and P. G. Pande, passed the M. R. C. V. S. course and returned to India. Mr. Shahi has been selected for appointment to the temporary post of Veterinary Investi- gation Officer for this province. Indian scholarships. 41. No new stipendiary students were selected for training at the Bengal or Behar Veterinary Colleges during the year. Eight stipendiary students who qualified from the Bengal Veterinary College were provided with appointments in the department. One stipendiary student failed in the final year class and three students failed in the 2nd year but were allowed to continue their studies at Government expense. Lectures on cattle diseases. 42. The subordinate staff of the department delivered 91 lectures to the Agricultural classes in vernacular middle schools, 15 lectures to patwari schools and patwaries, three lectures to adult schools, 110 lectures to agricultural schools, 12 lectures to the training class at Agricultural Farm in Fyzabad, 13 lectures to village and rural know- ledge class schools, 14 lectures to an Ahir High School and Ahirs, two lectures to Mirzapur Gram Sudhar Panchayat, 10 lectures to district exhibitions, publicity exhibitions, industrial exhibitions and fairs and shows and six lectures to agriculturists in general (including Ahirs). The total number of lectures was 276. 43. One veterinary inspector and 12 veterinary assistant surgeons were given practical training in the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest by the special veterinary inspector. 44. The veterinary inspectors toured for 160 days on an average during the year. They travelled 33,909 miles by rail and 17,789 miles by road, visiting 2,009 villages while on their tours.
(10) CHAPTER X EXPENDITURE Expenditure, Table XIV-A. 45. The total cost of the department during the year was Rs.4,58,047-0-8 as against Rs.5,11,887 in the year preceding. The receipts for the year were Rs. 1,37,866-5-3 against Rs. 1,11,706 last year. CHAPTER XI GENERAL REMARKS 46. The Cawnpore Agricultural Farm Veterinary Dispensary has during the year been transferred to the control of this department and the veterinary assistant surgeon in charge has, in addition to his own duties in the dispensary, to lecture to the Agriculture College students in veterinary science for which a small special pay is given to him. This procedure has effected an economy on the Agriculture College budget as the post of a whole-time lecturer has been abolished. 47. Four sanads were awarded during the year to the following persons for rendering help to the staff of the department in carrying out inoculations against cattle diseases : (1) Gir Prasad, patwari, village Jagsora, pargana and district Etawah. (2) Chaudhri Jai Narain, mukhia and zamindar, village Rahim, pargana and district Etawah. (3) Syed Shah Qutub Uddin Ahmed, zamindar and rais, village Choura, tahsil Bhognipur, district Cawnpore. (4) Bohray Kanhya Lal, zamindar and mukhia, village Jagraj- pur, tahsil Fatehabad, district Agra. 48. A special feature of this year's work was that certain new researches were made in different directions resulting in the discovery of two new parasites from poultry and the dog which is a matter of great importance to the veterinary scientists. There has also been an all round increase of work in the various branches of the depart- ment. 49. The Raja Sahib of Awagarh deserves a special mention for being the pioneer of the leading Rajas of the Province to have come forward for protection of his cattle against rinderpest by serum simul- taneous method which also be highly appreciated. 50. The horse breeding operations in the Meerut and Aligarh Districts (in the selected area) are not in a satisfactory state as the boards have not provided any sums in their budget and stallions had to be withdrawn from Meerut District last year. As. regards the Aligarh District, the Collector has been able to make provisional but temporary arrangements for the maintenance of the stallions in the
(11) current year but should the board be unable to provide funds next year, it would be difficult to see how the further retention of the stallions would be possible. 51. The work of the technical and clerical staff has on the whole been very satisfactory and I should like to mention the names of the following officers for their good work : (1) Babu Satya Kumar Mukerjee, my Head Assistant. (2) Veterinary Inspector, S. Udam Singh. (3) Laboratory Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Susil Kumar Acharya. 52. In conclusion, I must thank my Circle Officers, Khan Bahadur Sheikh Niaz Mohammad and Mr. T. S. Davies, for the way they have carried out their duties in their respective circles, also to my Deputy Superintendents for the way they have carried out their work. S. G. M.

( vii ) LIST OF APPENDICES Pages Table no. IIAnnual report on the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, for the year 1933-34 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. Captain S. G. M. Hickey, I.V.S., held charge of the Department as Director till his death from heart failure on August 1, 1933. I took charge of the office of Director on August 4, 1933, and continued till the end of the year. Captain Hickey was away from headquarters for 3 days. I toured for 78 days, visited 24 districts and inspected 19 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. I also went to Hissar and Bombay for the purchase of suitable stallions. 2. A new post of Circle Superintendent, with headquarters at Lucknow, was created from April 1, 1933, consequent on the abolition of 3 posts of Deputy Superintendents. There were there- fore three circles of Superintendents, and the names of the officers who held these posts and the amount of touring and inspection done by them may be seen from the following statement :( 2 ) CHAPTER II TTREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality Table II. 4. Cattle epidemics were almost as severe in the year under review as in the past year and the reported mortality was 54,450 as against 55,110 in the year preceding. (a) Equine Table II. 5. The death roll under this head increased, there being 188 cases as against 98 last year. Two cases of glanders were detected in the districts of Saharan- pur and Muzaffarnagar, the animals were destroyed and necessary precautionary measures were taken. One case of anthrax was detected in the Garhwal District. One hundred and thirteen cases of surra were discovered during the year of which 70 were from the Naini Tal District. There were 72 cases of deaths from other contagious diseases as against 86 in the past year. This head includes piroplasmosis, tetanus, strangles, etc. and diseases caused by internal and external parasites. (b) Bovine Rinderpest. Table II 6. This disease was less severe than in the previous year and the reported mortality was 40,450 against 43,600 during 1932-33. The number of deaths was over a thousand in 12 districts, the highest number was in the Naini Tal District where it was 6,379 ; the lowest number was in the Hamirpur District where it was only 3. Extra staff was deputed to several districts to cope with the work. Inoculations and other preventive measures were adopted. Anti rinderpest in- oculations. Table III. 7. Inoculations were performed in 1,282 outbreaks and the number of anti-rinderpest inoculations rose from 177,594 in the previous year to 184,057 in the year under report. Besides this number, 180 inoculations by the serum simultaneous method and 8,101 by the goat-virus alone method were performed. It was for the first time that serum simultaneous inoculations were carried out in the province during the course of a natural outbreak of rinderpest in the village. The promising feature of the goat-virus alone method of inoculation is its extremely low cost (which is about an anna per animal) and anticipated long duration of immunity. The treat- ment of rinderpest with iodine injection was continued during the year with successful results in the first and second stages of the disease. Foot-and-mouth disease. Table II. 8. Foot-and-mouth disease appeared in 41 districts of the province and the reported deaths numbered 1,086 as against 1,587 in the previous year. Curative methods and hygienic measures were adopted as far as possible and had beneficial effects.
( 3 ) Haemorrhagic sep- ticaemia. Tables II and III 9. Eight thousand, two hundred and seventy cases of deaths were reported from this disease as compared with 6,680 last year. It spread over the whole of the province except the Dehra Dun and Hamirpur Districts and the Kumaun Division. It was most severe in the Meerut District where the number of deaths was 686. The number of inoculations performed was 46,653 as against 40,177 in the preceding year. Besides this number 1,498 animals were immunised with haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine at the Government Cattle Farms in the Muttra, Jhansi, Naini Tal and Kheri Districts. Blackquarter. Tables II and III. 10. Five hundred and seventy-six cases of deaths were reported from this diseases as against 561 in the previous year. The number of inoculations performed was 3,973 against 3,929 last year. Anthrax. Tables II and III. 11. This disease was of a severe type as is evident from 924 reported deaths this year against 394 in the one preceding. The number of inoculations per- formed was 2,195 compared with 1,325 last year. Other contagious diseases. Table II. 12. Six hundred and seventy deaths were reported under this head as against 532 in the year preceding. They comprise liver-fluke, cow-pox, pleuro-pneumonia, etc. (c) Other animals Table II. 13. Two thousand, two hundred and eighty-six cases of deaths were reported to have occurred amongst animals other than equines and bovines. They included cases of rabies, distemper, piroplasmosis, fowl cholera and other parasitic diseases. CHAPTER III NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES Table V. 14. The number of cases treated at the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries during the year under report was 379,661 as against 327,878 in the previous year. Cases supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals numbered 57,038 against 56,101 last year. Both sets of figures indicate a comparative increase of work done. Tables IV and V. 15. Ninety-five thousand and twenty-three cases of animals were treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour in the interior of villages as compared with 93,183 in the year preceding. The number of castrations performed rose during the year to 72,850 as against 55,285 in the previous year. This gradual increase of work reflects credit to the staff and a mention may be made of M. Shamsuddin, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Phulpur, District Allahabad, and Babu Balkrishna Srivastava, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Dudhi, District Mirzapur, who performed 2,963 and 2,503 castrations respectively.
( 4 ) Cattle poisoning. 16. Two cases of cattle poisoning were reported from the Dis- tricts of Gorakhpur and Azamgarh. The accused person in the Gorakhpur District has been pro- secuted and dealt with legally, whereas the case of the Azamgarh District is under investigation. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table V. 17. There were 171 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the end of the last year but an addition of one was made in the Unao District and another in Agra City during the year under review. The total number, therefore, came to 173 at the close of the year. Grants-in-aid for con- struction of Veteri- nary hospitals. 18. As in the last two years, no contribution could be granted to local boards for the construction of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries during this year also owing to the prevalence of financial stringency. Applications received from district boards for monetary assistance could not be entertained. CHAPTER V LABORATORIES AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS Laboratory work. 19. Seven hundred and fifty-eight smears were microscopically examined at the headquarters and circle labora- tories during the year as against 1,309 in the preceding year. They comprised Bacteriological, Pathological, Helminthological and Entomological cases. Interesting specimens received for examination have been properly preserved and kept in the musuem of the laboratory. The smears examined were from different species of animals and the result of the examination is summarized in brief as under :( 5 ) with very satisfactory results and 17 were either discharged after the full period of observation or destroyed and their brains sent to Kasauli for examination. Experiments and in- vestigations on di- sease. 21. The prevalance of bovine contagious abortion was sus- pected in a herd of Sahiwal cattle at the Manjhra Government Cattle Farm. Serum of 14G head of cattle was prepared and despatched to the Imperial Veterinary Research Laboratory at Muktesar for the agglu- tination test which showed that 37 per cent. of the tested cattle gave evidence of the infection. A similar test was also carried out at the Mission Goat Breeding Farm at Etah. Experimental work on the control of " Fascioliasis " amongst cattle in the Almora District with " carbon tetrachloride " was continued during the year and the measures adopted were found to have brought the disease under control to a considerable extent. Experimental investigation was continued on the incidence of helminth parasites in pariah dogs. During the year, 100 dogs were examined and as a result much valuable information and data were collected. The incidence of hook-worms which have been identified as anoylostoma caninum was found to be 77 per cent. In addition other nematode, cestode and trematode worms were discovered and their incidence varied from 2 to 80 per cent. Tuberculin tests against tuberculosis and Johne's disease were carried out at the Government Manjhra Cattle Farm and the Allah- abad Agricultural Institute Farm and investigations revealed the pre- valence of Johne's disease and tuberculosis amongst some of the cattle. Further survey and biological tests conducted, if possible, at regular intervals will throw further light on the extent of infec- tion and spread of these diseases. Experiments on the chemo-therapy of " barsati " and " nasal granuloma " were conducted with antimosin and it was found that the product has a beneficial effect on the course of the disease. This product was found to be superior to tartar emetic in that it can be administered subcutaneously, is less toxic, more efficacious and with its administration the dangers of tartar emetic injections are eliminated. Experimental investigation was continued on the helminth para- sitic infection of poultry. It has been found that chickens are more susceptible and the mortality amongst them sometimes attains a very high figure. 22. Seven hundred and seventy-three cases were treated at the headquarters as against 549 in the preceding year. A sum of Rs.1,175-12 was realized towards treatment charges, etc. against Rs.l,038-9 last year. The cases treated were, as usual, of special interest and some were of an obscure nature.
( 6 ) CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Horse and pony stallions Table X. 23. At the beginning of the year there were 56 stallions belong- ing to the department for horse-breeding in the province excluding the selected districts, viz. Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh, where horse-breeding is controlled by the Army Remount Department. Four stallions were purchased during the year, two were destroyed and one died, the balance left at the close of the year being 57. Table XI. 24. Forty-seven stallions were employed on stud during the year and they performed 1,907 coverings. The num- ber of coverings last year was 1,888. The average was 40.6 per animal per year. 25. There has been no change in the number of stallion stands during the year. The stallion stand at Etah which was under con- templation is almost complete and the matter relating to the selec- tion of a suitable stallion for the stand is under correspondence with the Chairman, District Board. 26. It is a pleasure to note that the progeny of Government stallions continued to show improvement. Stallion Depot. 27. Satisfactory work was continued to be done at the Stallion Depot at Moradabad where stallions from districts were afforded rest and treatment as necessity demanded. (ii) Donkey stallions Table X. 28. The year opened with 7 jack donkeys on the roll of the de- partment for mule-breeding in the province. Four were newly purchased from the Government Farm at Hissar, thus there were 11 jacks at the close of the year. Table XI. 29. Eight donkeys were at stud work and the number of their coverings was 244 during the year, against 218 last year, making an average of 30.5 as against 27.2 per animal. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 30. A number of cattle and horse fairs and shows was held in the province during the year in which the officers and the subordinate staff of the Department participated. The Kulkula fair (Gorakhpur) was held twice in the year. The first one was held in April and was attended by me when I presided over the prize distribution. I also attended the Dewa fair in the
( 7 ) Bara Banki District, the Tanda rural exhibition in the Fyzabad District and the Chandapur fair in the Rae Bareli District. Mr. T. S. Davies attended the District exhibitions at Saharanpur and Aligarh, the Nauchandi fair at Meerut and the Makanpur fair in the Cawnpore District. In these exhibitions and fairs he acted as a member of the Judging Committee for award of prizes and also inspected and checked the work of the subordinate staff deputed there. Mr. Raza Husain attended the Etawah Exhibition and Poultry Shows at Bewar and Shikohabad in the Mainpuri District. At Etah he worked as a member of the Judging Committee. Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Qadir attended the Kakora fair (Budaun), the Debi Patan fair (Gonda) and the Magh Mela Exhibition in Allahabad. M. Mohammad Tahir Mirza attended the Dadri fair (Ballia) in which he presided over the prize distribution and also the Dewa fair (Bara Banki) where he supervised the whole veterinary arrangements with the assistance of the veterinary inspector of the Fyzabad Circle. A temporary veterinary hospital was also opened there under the charge of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Bara Banki, as an emergent measure which was highly beneficial to the rural public for the treat- ment of live-stock brought to the fair. Arrangements for the treatment of sick animals at other fairs and shows and for the check of outbreaks of contagious diseases, were also of immense good to the stock-owners. Veterinary exhibits. 31. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at the District Exhibition at Saharanpur, the Dewa fair, the Magh Mela Exhibition and at a rural exhibition held at Tanda, District Fyzabad. The exhibits were also taken to the Ram- nagar Cattle Fair, in the Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates and successfully displayed there. There appears to be an increasing demand for these and for the demonstration of other novel exhibits, that have an educative value, but an improvement in this direction is only possible when finances improve. CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 32. Propaganda work in a modest form, with the very limited resources of the Department, was undertaken. I delivered a lecture at the Kulkula fair (Gorakh- pur) on the proper upkeep of cattle and general measures to be adopted to prevent the spread of cattle diseases. Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Qadir delivered a lecture at the Debi Patan fair (Gonda) on veterinary aid and the welfare of cattle in general. The subordinate staff also delivered lectures at the different fairs and exhibitions and distributed pamphlets to interested people deal- ing with the common contagious diseases of animals.
( 8 ) Demonstrations of the painless method of castration by Burdizzo clamp had a great effect and the gradual increase in the number of castrated cases bears a testimony to this fact. CHAPTER IX ESATBLISHMENT Establishment. Table VII. 33. The subordinate staff at the end of the year was as follows :( 9 ) CHAPTER X EXPENDITURE Expanditure. Table XIVA. 39. The total cost of the department during the year was Rs.4,14,918 as against Rs.4,58,047 in the preced- ing year. The receipts for the year were Rs.1,26,381 as against Rs.1,37,866 in the previous year. CHAPTER XI GENERAL REMARKS 40. The sudden death caused by heart failure of Captain S. G. M. Hickey, i.v.s., the Director, on August 1, 1933, was a calamity that befell the department. He had been in the province for about 17 years and by his death the department lost a very able and experi- enced officer who tried to maintain high efficiency. 41. Eight sanads were awarded during the year to different persons for assistance rendered to the staff of the Department in carrying out inoculations. 42. The special feature of this year's work was the new method of immunisation of cattle by " goat-virus " conducted under the supervision of the new Veterinary Investigation Officer of this prov- ince, by which over 8,000 animals were protected against rinder- pest. Observations during the course of the operations presented vary- ing results. The adult stock of the villages (both cows and buffaloes) registered a definite reaction but in the farms there was only slightly appreciable reaction and in the majority of cases it was absent. Young stock takes the virus well. Reactions presented by them under village conditions were more marked and in some cases severe. 43. The work of both the technical and the clerical staff has on the whole been most satisfactory and I should like to mention the names of the following officers for their good work :( 10 ) In conclusion, I should like to thank my Circle Superintendents Mr. T. S. Davies, Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Qadir and Mr. S. M. Raza Husain for the good help they have rendered me by carrying out their duties in their respective circles. My thanks are also due to Mr. H. B. Shahi, the new Veterinary Investigation Officer, who has taken great pains in introducing the goat-virus method in the Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates of district Naini Tal. N.

Khan Bahadur Shaikh Niaz Mohammed officiated as Director Veterinary Service, up to June 30, 1934, after which date he retired on superannuation pension. I took charge of the department on July 1, 1934, and continued for the rest of the year under report. 2. Up to the time of handing over charge Khan Bahadur Shaikh Niaz Mohammed was on tour for 50 days, visited 8 districts, inspected 13 veterinary dispensaries and 5 stallion stands. I toured for 159 days, visited 27 districts, inspected 67 veterinary dispensaries and 9 stallion stands. I attended the Advisory Committee meetings of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla in Septem- ber, 1934, and at Delhi in February, 1935. I also proceeded to Bombay to purchase Arab stallions for the improvement of horse- breeding in the province. The amount of touring and inspection work done by the three Superintendents of the department is shown in the following statement :(2) The preparation of Tissue Vaccine against Rinderpest has been started at the Central Laboratory, Lucknow, under his supervision and in that connexion he went to the Bengal Veterinary College at Calcutta to have first hand information of the technique on the subject. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality( 3 ) Of these 30 died during the course of treatment, and 8 after having been treated and discharged; all these were cases in the advanced stages of the disease when treatment was started( 4 ) It is proposed to carry on this method of immunization work on an extensive scale in the future as the prolonged immunity produced by this method is more advantageous than the use of serum hitherto employed. Blackquarter(5) Mirzapur Districts respectively, where previously there were veterinary assistant surgeons purely on itinerating duty. The total number, at the close of the year, thus came to 178. Grants-in-aid for construction of veteri- nary hospitals. 18. Owing to continuing financial stringency grants to local boards for construction of veterinary hospitals in the districts could not be made. In the case of the District Board, Bareilly, a sum of Rs.3,000 was specially provided for the construction of the Sadr Veterinary hospital, as the old building was in a dangerous condition and had to be reconstructed. CHAPTER V LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS Laboratory work. 19. One thousand one hundred and fifty smears were microsco- pically examined at the headquarters and Circle Laboratories during the year as compared with 758 in the previous year. The materials consisted of Bacterio- logical, Pathological, Helminthological and Entomological cases. Some interesting specimens, and parasites received during the year have been preserved in the laboratory museum. The materials examined were from different species of animals and a brief summary of the results is given below :(6) samples of which together with a dosing appliance were placed at our disposal by Messrs. Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey, through the courtesy of Dr. W. L. Chandler of the Michigan State College of Agri. culture and Applied Science. The experimental evidence is highly encouraging, and although it is too early yet to formulate any definite results, it seems that this drug has great possibilities as an efficient poultry anthelmintic as in addition to its vermicidal action this product is a tonic and restorative and does not require the help of a comple mentary dose of purgative, which is a drawback with other anthel. mintics. Further experiments will be conducted and particular emphasis will be laid upon its use in other intestinal infections, egg laying capacity and its influence on general physical improvement. A few cases of ring-worm of poultry, known as " Favus " which is a rapidly spreading infection caused by a type of fungus known as " Achroian Gallenae " were diagnosed and an experimental treatment of this affection was conducted with encouraging results. Very scanty information has been available so far, regarding the incidence and economic losses occasioned by "Bovine contagious abortion." Recent Sero-diagnostic tests carried out at two Gaushalas and at the Etah goat-breeding farm have presented some striking results. The findings, besides being presentiments of a serious cattle menace, have an important significance from the public health point of view. Brucella Melitensis and Brucella Abortus bang are responsi- ble for the causation of Malta fever and Undulent fever respectively in human beings. Further investigation with a view to ascertain the extent of infec- tion, the spread of these diseases and adoption of proper control measure will be carried out in the near future. The treatment of Surra on a fairly extensive scale formed an out- standing feature of the year's field activities. The antiquated method of destruction of affected animals was abandoned and the initiation of this new method of treatment has been keenly appreciated by livestock owners. With a trained staff and adequate financial provision, endeavours can be made to check the heavy loss sustained by this invariably fatal infection, as well as control its rapid spread effectively. Several cases of Joint 111 among young calves were reported from the Government Cattle Farm, Manjhra, district Kheri. Samples of heart-blood and fluid from the affected joint were submitted to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar-Kumaun, for examination and report. The cultural examination of the material revealed the presence of (1) Staphylococcus Albus, (2) A micrococcus and (3) Streptococcus faecalis. Further investigation in the matter is proceeding. Investigation on Haemorrhagic skin disease in cattle caused by Filaria Multipapillosa was carried out in certain districts and it has been noticed that the disease occurs in all the districts of the Agra Circle, particularly in the summer months.
(7) Experiments for the treatment of Eczema in dogs were carried out by the intra-muscular injections of " Abijon " with a certain amount of success. " Abijon " is a milk product manufactured by- Saxon Serum Works Limited, Dresden, and is supplied in 2 cc, 5 cc. and 10 cc. ampoules. 22. Eight hundred and nineteen cases received treatment at the headquarters, as compared with 773 last year. A sum of Rs.1,035-15 was realized towards treatment charges etc. Some of the cases. treated were of special interest. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATION (i) Horse stallions Table X. 23. There were 57 stallions on the roll at the commencement of the year for horse-breeding in the province, excepting the selected districts of Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh, where horse-breeding is under the control of the Army Remount Department. Six stallions were purchased during the year, 5 were destroyed, and 2 died ; the balance left at the close of the year was 56. Table XI. 24. Forty-nine stallions were employed at the stud during the year and the covering operations performed, by them was 1,838. averaging 375 per animal per year. New stallion stands. 25. Two new stands were started during the year(8) CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 30. As in the previous years 23 cattle and horse fairs and shows were held in the province and were attended by the officers and subordinate staff of the depart- ment. I visted the Dewa fair in the Bara Banki District, the Batesar fair in the Agra District and the district exhibition at Saharanpur, where I acted as president of the judging committee of the horse show for award of prizes to stock owners. The Superintendent, Agra, attended the Batesar fair in the Agra District and the Saharanpur Horse and Cattle Fair and Show. He also attended the District Exhibitions at Aligarh and Etawah. The Superintendent, Lucknow, attended the fairs and shows at Maigalganj, district Sitapur, Banthra, district Lucknow, Qasimpur, district Budaun, Makanpur, district Cawnpore, and Kurri-Sidhauli and Chandapur, district Rae Bareli. The Superintendent, Allahabad, attended fairs at Dewa. district Bara Banki, Dadri, district Ballia and the Magh Mela Exhibition at Allahabad. At Dewa and Dadri fairs he presided over the judging committees. Veterinary exhibits. 31. Though the subordinate staff attends all exhibitions and fairs, the local arrangements for control and check of contagious disease at these fairs is far from satisfactory or complete and as a result they are the common source of the dissemination of contagious diseases. The public were interested in the display of veterinary exhibits at the district exhibitions at Saharanpur, Batesar fair, Mahoba Exhibi- tion, district Hamirpur, Dewa fair, Dadri fair, Magh Mela Exhibition and Babuganj fair, in the Partabgarh District. The exhibits were also displayed at the Ramnagar Cattle Fair in the Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates. The Magh Mela Agricultural Exhibition was graced by the visit of His Excellency the Governor of the United Provinces, who showed much interest in our exhibits. CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 32. Propaganda work advocating the usefulness of the department's activities is poor. Apart from a few exhibits of doubtful value the department is not equipped with the necessary modern means of educating the rural population on the importance of a Veterinary Department, and its usefulness as an agent for maintaining the health of livestock in the province. Money as needed for this and Government and local bodies should make provision for this important work.
(9) Pamphlets dealing with the common contagious diseases amongst animals were distributed and lectures were delivered at the different fairs and shows dealing briefly with the suppression and control of infectious diseases. Demonstrations of castrations by the Burdizzo's clamp were made at various places and had the desired effect of gaining public apprecia- tion. CHAPTER IX ESTABLISHMENT Establishment(10) 37. The Veterinary Inspectors toured on an average for 175 days in the year. They visited 2,134 villages during their tours. CHAPTER X EXPENDITURE Expenditure( 11 ) product and a step further in the control of rinderpest, a problem that is of immense importance to livestock owners in a country which is practically saturated with animal disease.

I held charge of the department for the whole of the year under report, and remained on tour for 212 days visiting 78 veterinary hospi- tals and dispensaries and 14 stallion stands in 36 districts. I attended meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricul- tural Research held at Simla in July, 1935, and at Delhi in February, 1936. I also attended the Animal Husbandry Research Workers' Conference held at Delhi in February, 1936. I visited Bombay and Hissar to purchase horse and donkey stallions for the improvement of horse and donkey breeding in the province. I visited Rampur State and Balrampur Estate and gave advice to the officials on veter- inary organization and on the advisability of having a well-equipped veterinary staff to deal with livestock work and improvement in their respective States. I also paid a visit to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, Imperial Veterinary Serum Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly, Allahabad Agricultural Institute, Naini, Mission Poultry Farm, Etah, and the Government Cattle Farm, Madhuri- kund, district Muttra. Frequent visits were also paid to the Govern- ment Stallion Depot, Moradabad. I attended the fair at Debi Patan and supervised the propaganda which was being conducted by the staff of the department. The work of itinerating veterinary assistant surgeons was checked and scrutinized by me. Rural development meetings were attended where such meetings coincided with my visits to the districts. 2.

(4) Coccidiosis. (5) Tuberculosis and Johne's disease. (6) Leishmaniasis. (7) Bovine contagious abortion. (8) Necrosis of the horn. He also supervised the treatment of surra in the different centres, and the manufacture of Tissue Vaccine against rinderpest at the Research Station, Lucknow. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality(3) Surra. Further progress in the treatment of this disease was made during the year under review and 1,349 cases were treated as compared with 329 in the last year as per details below:( 4 ) Of these 60 died during the course of treatment and 48 after having been treated and discharged. Thirty deaths were reported before treatment was adopted. From the above it will be seen that the disease has a wide dig. tribution in the provinces and though the distribution is unequal it is sufficient to indicate the presence of the disease and the transmitting agents in these centres. The principal reason for the apparently high mortality during and after treatment was the advanced stage of the disease and the debilitated condition of these animals when brought for treatment. In carrying out the treatment of this disease the staff is handi- capped for want of proper hospital facilities and for lack of accom- modation for patients when undergoing treatment. It is hoped that these defects will be remedied in the near future. The treatment has been taken up as a routine in most hospitals in the province and its efficacy is being recognized. Cases of relapses in mules have again been reported from some centres, though it has been difficult to get a sufficient number under proper observation. This year it is intended to elucidate the causation of these relapses in mules and to investigate the possibilities of counteracting the factors that lead to the cerebro-spinal manifestations after these animals are discharged in good condition. Other diseases. Seventy-two deaths from other diseases were reported this year as compared with 78 in the preceding year, these included piroplasmosis, strangles, tetanus and other parasitic diseases. (b) Bovine Rinderpest( 5 ) Foot-and-mouth dis- ease( 6 ) Tables IV and V. 15. The cases treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour numbered 170,451 against 141,650 in the previous year. The number of castrations per- formed during the year rose from 83,799 in the previous year to 92,360 in the year under report. Cattle poisoning. 16. Eight cases of cattle poisoning were reported from the dis- tricts of Saharanpur, Meerut, Aligarh, Budaun and Unao. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries-( 7 ) Anti-rabic treatment. 20. Thirty-one incontact cases were dealt with at the Isolation wards, Lucknow, out of which 20 cases were given anti-rabic treatment and recovered. Eleven cases were kept under observation out of which 8 were confirmed and 3 were discharged. Experiments and in- vestigations on diseases. 21, A very severe outbreak of Doyle's disease occurred at the United Provinces Poultry Association farm during the early part of the summer 1935,. resulting in very heavy mortality. The morbid material sent to Muktesar from diseased and dead fowls proved positive on biological examination. In the absence of serum or vaccine all possible measures of disinfection and segre- gation were resorted to. Systematic experiments on the etiology and control of an obscure disease of the Bhadri Kennels were conducted by the Veterinary Investigation Officer in collaboration with the staff of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. These workers have prepared a polyvalent vaccine against this disease which has definitely proved its curative value in some cases while with indifferent results in others. Further work on the diagnosis and serum therapy is neces- sary to elucidate the true etiology and the efficacy of the biological products. During his stay at Muktesar the Veterinary Investigation Officer had an opportunity of working on the etiology of contagious ecthyma in goats in collaboration with the staff of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research and concluded that a filterable virus is respons- ible for this condition in these animals. Prophylactic vaccination and control have not hitherto been practised though the manufacture of an effective biological agent is an economic procedure. The product will be used on all future occasions when the necessity arises. A severe outbreak amongst the buffalo-calves at the Government Cattle Farm, Muttra, was investigated, which on the examination of the morbid material was attributed to severe coccidiosis. With a view to eliminate the possibility of an associated primary "White Scour " infection, serum from all the dams was put to the agglutina- tion test against the known White Scour antigens. An organism resembling "Coryne bacterium pyogenes" has been isolated from the morbid material and further work on its specificity is in progress. In continuation of the work initiated last year the treatment of surra was undertaken on a much larger scale in various districts affect- ed with the disease. A modified technique of substituting four in- jections for the original seven has been practised at various centres with satisfactory results. Two injections of a 2 per cent. "Naganol" solution were administered in an interval of 22 days and in between these were sandwiched two injections of 1 per cent. Tartar Emetic solution (60 to 100 c.c.) at intervals of seven days. Cases of relapse are being carefully watched in animals which have received the short course of treatment.
(8) The interesting Sero-diagnostic tests against contagious abortion conducted last year were continued. Out of the total number of 1,843 animals tested 35 proved positive. The reactors included 2 bulls and 4 bullocks. Three herds at Allahabad and one at Agra were subjected to the tuberculin tests for the detection of Tuberculosis and Johne's dis- ease. The total number of cattle tested was 365 out of which 8 proved positive and 2 suspicious for Tuberculosis, and 2 proved suspicious for Johne's infection. For the first time in this province Leishmania infection was diag- nosed in a dog at the Research Station Hospital, Lucknow. The history of the case under reference, and the microscopical appearance of the parasite led one to incriminate "Leishmania Donavani" in the etiology. Smears submitted to the Imperial Institute of Veter- inary Research, Muktesar, were declared positive for parasite indis- tinguishable from "Leishmania Tropica". Neostibosan has not been efficacious in the dog even after eight intravenous injections, and Berberene sulphate recommended by Bennett is now being given a trial. The condition known as Necrosis of horn or horn cancer of bovines is met with frequently all over the province but particularly in the Eastern districts. Numerous specimens forwarded to the Im- perial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for histopatholo- gical examination have invariably presented the typical features of epithelioma. It is intended to investigate the etiology of this condi- tion in full detail during 1936-37. 22. One-thousand and twenty-four cases were treated at the Research Station Hospital as compared with 819 last year. A sum of Rs.1,102-10 was realized towards treatment charges, etc. Most of the cases treated were of special interest. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Horse stallions Table X. 23. The year began with 56 stallions on the roll for horse breeding in the non-selected districts of the province. Four stallions were purchased during the year, three were destroyed, two were sold and one was returned to the donor being unfit for further stud work. The number of stallions at the close of the year was 54. Table XI. 24. Forty-six stallions were actually employed at the stud during the year ; and 1,773 mares were covered( 9 ) Stallion depot. 27. The Stallion Depot at Moradabad continues to prove its use- fulness as a place of rest and treatment for stallions that come in from the districts. Newly purchased stallions are also trained there before being sent to the districts. (ii) Donkey stallions Table X. 28. There were 9 jacks on the roll at the beginning of the year. Two were purchased and one was destroyed leaving a balance of 10 at the close of the year. Table XI. 29. Nine donkeys were actually employed at work and covered 283 mares. The average of coverings per animal was 31.4. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 30. Twenty-six important horse and cattle fairs and shows were held in the province during the year and all were attended by the officers of the department who judged and distributed prizes at the fairs held in their respective circles. The Superintendent, Agra Circle, attended the fairs and shows held at Meerut, Batesar, district Agra, Etawah, Aligarh and Saharan- pur, and acted as a menber of the judging committee and inspected and supervised the work of the subordinate staff deputed there. The Superintendent, Lucknow Circle, attended Kakora Fair and Kasimpur Exhibition in Budaun District, Makanpur Fair in Cawn- pore District, Haldwani Show in Naini Tal District, Mohibullapur Cattle Fair in Lucknow District, Gauriya Kalan Fair in Unao District and Bhaureshwar Fair in Rae Bareli District. The Superintendent, Allahabad Circle, attended Dewa Fair, dis- trict Bara Banki, Dadri Fair, district Ballia and Debi Patan Fair, district Gonda and delivered lectures explaining the advantages of scientific veterinary aid to the public. Veterinary exhibits. 31. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at the district exhibitions Saharanpur, Aligarh and Etawah and at the Horse and Cattle Fairs at Batesar, district Agra, Dewa, district Bara Banki, Dadri, district Ballia, Magh Mela Exhibition, district Allahabad, Haldwani, district Naini Tal, Misrikh and Kotra Fairs, district Sitapur, Gola, district Kheri, Malihabad, district Lucknow, Gauriya Kalan, district Unao, and Bhaureshwar Fair, district Rae Bareli. The staff made necessary arrangements for the treatment of sick animals at fairs and for guarding against outbreak of contagious dis- eases. The present arrangements made by local bodies are not suffi- ciently complete or effective to enable the staff to deal properly with disease and its control at these fairs, which are important foci of disease and its spread. It is hoped that the introduction of draft rules which are being submitted to Government for approval will enable the department to deal more effectively with this problem in the future.
( 10 ) CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 32. It is regretted that this important section of the department's work has not had the financial support neces- sary to demonstrate to stock owners the many opportunities and facilities which the department can offer in the way of assistance with regard to disease, its prevention and cure. It has been noticed that in many instances where the department's agents are ready to employ modern methods of prophylaxis in livestock the villagers are not always receptive. This antipathy can be overcome only by departmental propaganda and education. Vernacular pamphlets dealing with the common diseases of animals were distributed and lectures were delivered by the staff of the depart- ment at the different fairs and shows held during the year. Lectures were also delivered by the staff in connexion with the rural develop- ment work. CHAPTER IX ESTABLISHMENT Establishment( 11 ) Practical training 36. Practical training in the technique of the newly adopted method of immunization against rinderpest was imparted to newly appointed veterinary assistant surgeons and inspectors at the headquarters laboratory and to a number of veterinary assistant surgeons in the district by their respective circle veterinary inspectors and superintendents. Tours of velerinary inspectors. 37. Veterinary inspectors toured on an average for 177 days in the year. They visited 2,152 villages during their tours. CHAPTER X EXPENDITURE Expenditure(12) 44. The scheme for the creation of a special tract with augmen. ted staff sanctioned by Government for the control of cattle epidemic in one of the selected districts has been put into operation in Agu District and the results are being carefully watched. The department is expecting a share of the Rural Development grant to enable it to take part in that co-operation which is so essentia! for the success of the scheme as a whole. It is to be hoped that the department will soon obtain an opportunity of dealing with some of the livestock problems in the centres selected for development. 45. A skeleton map of the United Provinces indicating the oper- ations of the Civil Veterinary Department is given at the end of the report. 46. In recognition of his very excellent work in the department Government were pleased to confer upon Veterinary Inspector S. Udam Singh the title of Sardar Sahib in January, 1936. This opportunity is taken to record appreciation of the services received from the officers and staff of the department who continued to work conscientiously during the year. I particularly wish to mention the excellent work of the Veterinary Investigation Officer whose investigation report has been submitted to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. T. J.

IIAnnual report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, for the year 1936-37 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. Mr. T. J. Egan, I.V.S., held charge of the department up to 19th March, 1937, after which date he proceeded on leave out of India for eight months. I took over charge as officiating Director, Veter- inary Services, in the afternoon on 19th March, 1937. 2. Mr. T. J. Egan remained on tour for 264 days visiting 78 vet- erinary hospitals and dispensaries and 13 stallion stands in 33 districts. He attended meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Simla in July, 1936, and at Delhi in Jan- uary, 1937. He visited Poona and Bombay to purchase horse stallions for the improvement of horse breeding in the United Provinces. He visited Rampur State in connexion with the newly organized veterinary department, made a survey of the different types of cattle, and advised the authorities on the general improvement of livestock in the State. He visited the Imperial Verterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, the Mission Poultry Farm, Etah and Government Cattle Farms at Madhuri- kund, district Muttra, Hempur, district Naini Tal, and Manjhra, district Kheri. Frequent visits were paid to the Stallion Depot, Moradabad. He visited the Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates, and advised the authorities about a better veterinary organization for the improvement of livestock. He carried out a tour in the Garhwal District and in the districts of the Bundelkhand Division, to make a survey of the sheep industry in these areas. He organized one-day horse shows at stallion stands in the Saharanpur, Bareilly, Budaun and Moradabad Districts to encourage horse breeding, and distributed prizes to the progeny of Government stallions. 3. The touring and inspection work performed by the Circle Super- intendents of the department is shown in the following statement:( 2 ) Circle Superintendents Number of days on tour Number of veterinary dispen- saries inspected Number of stallion stands Sardar Sahib S. Udam Singh, officiating Superinten- dent, Lucknow (from 16th September, 1936 to 11th January, 1937). 55 15 5 Khan Sahib Chaudhry Ghulam Qadir, Superintendent, Lucknow, (from 12th January to 31st March, 1937). 43 15 4 Khan Sahib Chaudhry Ghulam Qadir Superintendent, Allahabad (from 1st April to 31st August, 1936, and from 1st to 4th January, 1937). 74 28 4 Mr. Mohammad Tahir Mirza, officiating Superinten- dent, Allahabad (from 1st September to 31st December, 1936, and from 5th January to 31st March, 1937). 104 39 6 No Circle Superintendent held charge of his respective circle for the full year. I proceeded on deputation to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, for a post-graduate course for about three months; and in March, 1937, was appointed as officiating Director, Veterinary Services. Mr. S. M. Raza Husain, Superintendent, Lucknow Circle, retired on superannuation pension on 16th September, 1936; and Khan Sahib Chaudhry Ghulam Qadir was on four months' leave from 1st September to 31st December, 1936. In these vacancies Veterinary Inspectors Mr. Mohammad Tahir Mirza and Sardar Sahib S. Udam Singh were promoted as officiating Superintendents. 4. On the retirement of Mr. S. M. Raza Husain, Superintendent, Lucknow Circle, on 16th September, 1936, Mr. H. B. Shahi was appointed as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, but continued to work as Veterinary Investigation Officer. He spent 165 days on tour, and visited 19 districts in the provinces. He worked on the following diseases:( 3 ) CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious Diseases Mortality( 4 ) Name of district Name of treatment centre Number of cases treated 9. Mainpuri .. ..

It is gratifying to note that stock owners are taking an increasing interest in the treatment offered, and are realizing the benefits that can be obtained from it for their animals. Anthrax. Two cases of this disease were reported from the Bulandshahr District, and one from the Bahraich District.
( 5 ) Other contagious diseases. Ninety-two deaths from other infections were reported during the year as against 72 in the previous year, these included piroplasmosis, strangles, tetanus and parasitic diseases. Other causes. Deaths due to causes other than from contagious diseases numbered 273. It is the first time that mortality under this head has been recorded. (b) Bovine Rinderpest( 6 ) Anthrax(7) CHAPTER IV Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries( 8 ) In June a virulent form of goat-pox occurred in the herd. Post- mortem examination revealed generalized pleurisy and consolidation of a major portion of the lung parenchyma, and copious amounts of sero-fibrinous exudate in the thoracic cavity. Transmission experi- ments conducted at the farm and at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, confirmed the diagnosis. In the absence of a suitable vaccine or other biological product, control measures were limited to segregation and systematic treatment of the affected animals. The knowledge gained from this outbreak has been of great value as it was thought that goat-pox was a mild disease. A similar type of outbreak was recorded in the Agra District and the preparation of a suitable vaccine appears necessary. Later in the year an obscure infection occurred in the Jamnapari herd which caused heavy losses. Work in this connexion was done in collaboration with the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The most prominent symptom was a severe form of diarrhoea result- ing in emaciation, the animals were disinclined to move and had a tendency to lie down with heads bent towards the flanks. The course of the disease was varied and quite a large number of deaths occurred within 24 hours after the onset of diarrhoea. Others died in from 3 to 10 days, and chronic cases lived for 20 or 25 days, and some sur- vived. About 25 per cent. of the total seizures manifested the chronic form of the disease. Post-mortem lesions were confined to the aboma- sum, duodenum and large intestines. Treatment did not give any satisfactory results. In the early stages of the outbreak measures were taken to eliminate rinderpest and the herd was dealt with by the serum simultaneous method; but this did not help. It was also thought a food poisoning might be responsible. Grain and fodder samples were sent to the Chemical Examiner to Government and the Chemistry Department, Allahabad University, for examination of organic and inorganic poisons and group alkaloids of toxic significance. The findings were not helpful. Transmission experiments were also conducted at the farm with blood and faeces collected from affected cases without result. A report from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar, on histopathological examinations and transmission experiments in- dicated that the disease was caused primarily by a filterable virus, and secondarily complicated by the massive parasitic infection existing among the goats. An analogous infection in sheep bearing a close clinical resemblance to that observed in the goats at Etah was encountered in the Etawah District. Enquiry revealed that the disease had accounted for enor- mous losses in many flocks. Certain cases were kept under observation and a few were subjected to post-mortem examination. The report on the examination of morbid material, forwarded to Muktesar, is awaited.
( 9 ) An outbreak responsible for heavy mortality in pigs was investigated at Keventer's Farm, Aligarh. Observations revealed that about two- thirds of the whole stock was harbouring an acute form of foot-and- mouth infection. Many of the affected and in-contact individuals registered a temperature between 104 to 106.° The losses were parti- cularly heavy in young stock, no deaths being reported in pigs, over two years in age. Post-mortem observations suggested the possibility of a concurrent infection and the examination of morbid material, forwarded to Muktesar, revealed that "Pasteurella" infection was operating simultaneously with the apparent foot-and-mouth infection. Experiments designed to compute the minimum doses of ordinary anti-rinderpest serum to be administered simultaneously with Goat Tissue Vaccine for protecting buffaloes against severe reaction were carried out in some districts. The available experimental evidence indicates that( 10 ) cent. and in animals exhibiting the acute symptoms it is seldom possible to adopt suitable treatment measures as the disease runs a very short course. Some acute cases were treated with different strengths of Naganol and 1 per cent. Tartar Emetic solution. Naganol has not proved so effective as in camels and horses and only 50 per cent. of the treated cases recovered. The treatment of surra in equines and camels with a combination of Naganol and Tartar Emetic was continued during the year with fairly satisfactory results. With a view to economize in the treatment a trial was made with injections of Tartar Emetic alone. This did not yield satisfactory results due to the rapid trypanocidal action of the drug. 25. Two thousand two hundred and thirty-two cases were treated at the Research Station Hospital, Lucknow, as against 1,024 cases last year. A sum of Rs. 892-8-0 was realized towards treatment charges. Some of the cases treated were of special interest. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Horse Stallions Table X. 26. The year commenced with 54 stallions on the roll for horse breeding in the non-selected districts of the province. Four stallions were purchased during the year, two were destroyed, three died and one was sold being unfit for further stud work. The number of stallions at the close of the year was 52. Table XI. 27. Forty-eight stallions were actually employed at stud during the year and the covering operations performed by them numbered 1,616. 28. Three new stallion stands were opened during the year at Paintipur, district Fyzabad, Partabgarh, and Rampura Estate, district Jalaun. Two stallion stands at Kosi Kalan and Mahaban in the Muttra District were closed during the year, and a new stand was opened at village Jachonda in this district. Proposals for opening new stands in the Bijnor and Unao Districts are under consideration, and it is hoped these will be started in the near future. 29. The progeny of Government stallions continues to show improvement, and some good stock were exhibited at the United Provinces Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition and other horse shows in districts. Stallion depot. 30. The Stallion Depot at Moradabad was very useful during the year as a place of rest and treatment for stallions that came in from the districts. Newly purchased stallions were trained there before being sent to the districts.
( 11 ) (ii) Donkey Stallions Table X. 31. There were 10 jacks on the roll at the beginning of the year; one died leaving 9 at the close of the year. Table XI. 32. Nine donkeys were actually employed at work during the year and covered 260 mares. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 33. Twenty-nine important horse and cattle fairs and shows were held in the province during the year, and these were attended by the officers and subordinate staff of the department. The Superintendent, Agra Circle, attended the fairs and shows held at Batesar, district Agra, Etawah, Bulandshahr and Etah, and acted as a member of the judging committees, and supervised the work of the subordinate staff. He also organized one day horse shows at Mahaban and Kosi Kalan in Muttra District, Etah and Mainpuri, distributed prizes to the progeny of the departmental stallions, and delivered lectures on the advantages of keeping good mares for breeding purposes. The Superintendent, Lucknow Circle, attended the United Provinces Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Lucknow, Qasimpur Exhibition in Budaun District, Makanpur Fair in Cawnpore District and Bhaur- eshwar Fair in Rai Bareli District. He also organized one-day horse shows in certain districts of his jurisdiction for the advancement of horse breeding. The most successful were those at Qasimpur, Aonla and Khander. The Superintendent, Allahabad Circle, attended Debi Paran Fair, district Gonda, Dadri Fair, district Ballia, Dewa Fair, district Bara Banki and Babuganj Fair, district Partabgarh. He supervised the veterinary arrangements, delivered lectures and acted as a member of the judging committees of the last three fairs. The staff made necessary arrangements for the treatment of sick animals at fairs and for guarding against outbreak of contagious diseases. The present arrangements made by local bodies are not sufficiently complete or effective to enable the staff to deal properly with disease and its control at these fairs, which are important foci of dis- ease and its spread. It is hoped that the draft rules, which have been submitted to Government for approval, will enable the department to deal more effectively with this problem in the future. Veterinary exhibits. 34. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at horse and cattle fairs at Batesar, district Agra, Dewa, district Bara Banki, Haldwani, district Naini Tal, Bhaureshwar Fair, district Rae Bareili, Misrikh Paikarma Fair, district Sitapur, Rural Development Exhibitions and Fairs at Unao and Nenanjat, district Agra, and the United Provinces Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Lucknow.
(12) CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 35. With the limited resources of the department it has not been possible to carry out propaganda work on the scale desired, which is so very necessary to educate stock owners of the advantages to be gained by making use of modern methods in verterinary science, and livestock improvement. For this purpose more men and money are required. Vernacular pamphlets in simple language were distributed, and lectures were delivered by the staff at exhibitions, fairs and rural development centres on the benefits of inoculation against livestock epidemics, elimination of scrub bulls by scientific castration, and the necessity of maintaining good breeds of cattle. CHAPTER IX ESTABLISHMENT 36. The superior staff consisted of:(13) CHAPTER X EXPENDITURE Expenditure. Table XIVA. 41. The total expenditure of the department during the year was Rs.4,49,707 against Rs.4,27,341 in the preceding year. The receipts for the year were Rs. 1,30,525 as against Rs. 1,29,019 in the preceding year. CHAPTER XI GENERAL REMARKS 42. The training class for compounders at the Central Research Station, Lucknow, has made progress during the year, and 47 candidates were trained and given certificates of proficiency compared with 14 in the preceding year. 43. By the retirement of Mr. S. M. Raza Husain, Superintendent, Lucknow Circle, on 16th September, 1936, the department lost a cap- able and experienced officer. He commenced his career as a veterinary assistant surgeon and finished as a Circle Superintendent, which testifies to a creditable record of service. 44. Four sanads were awarded to persons in the districts of Sitapur, Ballia, Etawah and Muzaffarnagar for assistance rendered to the staff in inoculation work. 45. Operations in the Special Tract Scheme introduced in the Agra District for the efficient control of livestock epidemics were care- fully watched during the year. The work done in this connexion with the useful information collected regarding spread of epidemics, has fully justified the additional staff sanctioned for the purpose. Rinderpest required most attention and the inoculation figures speak for themselves. Twenty-five thousand eight hundred and seventy animals were immunized against this disease as compared with 6,743 in the previous year. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia also received attention, and 4,906 inoculations were performed against 1,439 in the preceding year. The scheme has given the department an opportunity to get into much closer contact with the agriculturists, and to demonstrate how beneficial modern methods in veterinary science are for their livestock diseases. With the progress that has been shown in the Agra District, it is hoped that operations on similar lines will be extended to other districts in the near future. 46. The Rinderpest Vaccine Centre opened in the previous year at the Central Laboratory, Lucknow, has been of great utility to the department during the year under review. The vaccine produced is for more efficient and economical for immunizing livestock against rinderpest as compared with the old method of 'Serum alone."
( 14 ) The antigenic value of the product manufactured at Lucknow is tested from time to time for its potency at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Muktesar. 47. It is regretted that the scheme for cattle welfare units in rural development centres could not be put into operation, and it is hoped the department will be given an opportunity to prove its usefulness in dealing with livestock problems in the rural development areas. 48. The year was marked by the United Provinces Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition in which the department organized a veterinary section. I desire to thank the following officials and non-official gentlemen for their help in connexion with the veterinary exhibits:(15) TABLE II Statement showing the number of deaths from contagious diseases and other causes among animals during 1936-37 Details Equines Cattle Buffaloes Sheep Goats Dogs Camels Glanders Surra Dourine Anthrax Other diseases Other causes Total Rinderpest Haemorrhagic Septicaemea Foot and mouth Black quarter Anthrax Surra Other diseases Other causes Total Rinderpest Haemorrhagic Septicaemea Foot and mouth Black quarter Anthrax Surra Other diseases Other causes Total Anthrax Sheep pox Pleuro pnuemonia Foot and mouth Scab Other diseases Other causes Total Anthrax Sheep pox Pleuro pneumonia Foot and mouth Scab Other diseases Other causes Total Rabies Other diseases Other causes Total Surra Mange Pleuro pneumonia Other diseases Other causes Total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 Total .. 36 555 .. 3 92 273 959 9,944 4,947 499 524 275 173 290 11,896 28,548 10,957 7,301 106 115 76 27 192 3,590 22,364 2 34 500 1 70 93 469 1,169 1 16 17 1 313 255 1,762 2,365 241 613 352 1,206 37 6 2 37 86 168 NOTE( 16 ) TABLE III Summary of results of preventive inoculation in the United Provinces during the year 1936-37 District Number of outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken Number of villages affected in these outbreaks Bovine population of affected villages Number of animals which died unino- culated in course of outbreaks Number of animals inoculated Number inoculat anima which die the dise Bovines Equines Others Bovines Equines Others Bovines Equines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Rinderpest inoculation (a) By serum alone method (serum obtained from Im- perial Veterinary Research Insti- tute, Muktesar).

(5) Besides the districts mentioned above cases of surra were detected in the districts of Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Basti and Azamgarh, but they died before treatment could be adopted. They were advanced cases of the desease. No deaths from Anthrax were reported during the year. Anthrax. Other contagious di- seases. One hundred and twelve deaths under this head were reported during the year as against 92 in the last year, these included strangles; piroplasmosis and other parasitic diseases. Other causes. Under this head 246 deaths were reported as compared with 273 in the previous year. (b) Bovine Rinderpest(6) Blackquarter(7) Tables IV and V. in the last year. 19. The number of cases treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour was 82,366 as compared with 81,837 Elimination of scrub animals by humane methods of castration numbered 123,004 as against 99,571 in the previous year. Cattle poisoning. 20. Cases of cattle poisoning were reported from the districts of Saharanpur, Bareilly, Ballia and Azamgarh, the one from Ballia was declared negative by the Chemical Examiner to Government. The accused persons were dealt with according to law. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries(8) In addition to the smears and samples of other morbid material from interesting cases helminthological and entomological specimens were also received. Morbid materials and interesting parasites were sent to Mukteswar laboratory and to the officer-in-charge of the Hel- minthiasis scheme in the Lucknow University for systematic exami- nation. Anti-rabic treatment. 24. Forty-one in-contact cases were dealt with at the Isolation Wards, Lucknow, and 28 cases were given anti-rabic treatment; 13 cases kept under observation developed rabies and were destroyed or died. Experiments and inves- tigation on diseases. 25. The experimental work on computation of the minimum dose of ordinary anti-rinderpest serum, simultaneously necessary with goat tissue vaccine for controlling the severe reaction produced by this antigen in goats and sheep was repeated at the Central Laboratory, Lucknow. The experiments re- vealed that the required dose of the serum for adult goats and sheep should range between 20 to 30 c.c. per animal. Further experiments were undertaken in Muttra and Mainpuri districts to compute the minimum dose of ordinary anti-rinderpest serum necessary to control the severity of reactions produced by goat tissue vaccine in buffaloes. One hundred and fifty buffaloes were experimented upon using a simultaneous dose of ordinary serum worked out at 3 to 6 c.c. per 100 lb. body weight with the provision that the minimum dose of anti-serum was not less than 15 c.c. per animal and the minimum dose in pregnant and milch buffaloes was between 30 to 40 c.c. The usual routine treatment of surra was taken up all over the province. As a special feature experiments were conducted at Aligarh and Shamli (district Muzaffarnagar) to determine the minimum curative and prophylactic dose of Naganol for combating surra in equines. The work was undertaken in collaboration with the Superin- tendent, Agra Circle, and financed jointly by the department and the National Horse Breeding and Show Society of India. A vast amount of useful information has emerged from the experiment. Controlled experiments showed that most of the cures were obtained with doses at 4, 5 and 6 grammes of Naganol per 1,000 lb. body weight adminis- tered twice at an interval of a fortnight while a single dose failed to effect a complete cure. It was also observed that the success of the treat- ment depended mostly on the stage of the disease and that much success cannot be hoped for in advanced stages. The drug was also employed prophylactically with promising results in single and repeated doses varying from 1 to 5 grammes per 1,000 lb. body weight. As. however, owing to insufficient rainfall the disease prevailed in a mild form during the year the experiments will be repeated for confirmation of the results obtained this year. A peculiar condition was observed among goats at Bhadri, district Partabgarh. The affected young stock showed fever followed by stiff- ness and lameness of the fore legs. The affected joint, being invariably the knee, revealed tenderness and diffuse inflamation. Fifty per cent.
(9) of the kids with high temperatures recovered without manifesting any stiffness of the limbs, adult goats on the other hand died exhibiting symptoms of paralysis followed by a semi-comatose condition. Investi- gation conducted in. collaboration with the Imperial Institute of Veteri- nary Research, Mukteswar, revealed that the trouble was not of bac- terial or virus origin but was considered to be associated with inanition and debility possibly aided by an infestation of external and internal parasites. Further investigation is intended to be taken up by trans- mission experiments when a suitable opportunity presents itself. A typical outbreak of sheep pox was noticed in Muttra District. Prophylactic vaccination of the in-contact flocks with vaccine obtained from the Mysore Serum Institute was conducted and it was observed that though the mortality dropped from 90 to about 20 per cent. the vaccine was not effective in imparting a solid immunity to the vaccinated animals. Tuberculin tests by the double intradermal method were carried out at various places in the province for detection of tuberculosis and Johne's disease with the following results:(10) Horn cancer. Some cases of horn cancer examined showed features of squamous cell carcinoma, but the lesions in one case showed carcinoma of the adrenal cortex. Nec- rotic and haemorrhagic foci and signs of marked malignancy were present. Nasal granuloma. Bovine Nasal Granuloma was reported in Hardoi District and a number of cases were successfully treated with 15 to 20 c.c. of a 3 per cent. solution of tartar emetic administered intravenously according to body weight. Spirochaetosis. Outbreaks of spirochaetosis in poultry were recorded and ticks collected from the infected birds, were identified as the common "Argus persicus" by the Muktes- war laboratory. Tuberculosis of a severe type, affecting the organs of the abdo- minal cavity in 3 birds, was diagnosed at the Mission Poultry Farm, Etah. The examination of the morbid material forwarded to Muk- teswar corroborated the findings. Research Station. 26. Two thousand seven hundred and six cases were treated at the Research station Hospital, Lucknow, as against 2,232 cases last year. Rs.1,760 were realized towards treatment charges as against Rs. 892-8 realized in the last year. Some of the cases treated were highly interesting. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Horse stallions Table X. 27. There were 52 stallions on the roll at the beginning of the year for horse-breeding in the non-selected districts of the province. Nine stallions were purchased during the year, 2 were destroyed, 2 died and 1 was sold being unfit for further stud work; the number left at the close of the year was 56. Table XI. 28. Forty-eight stallions were employed at the stud during the year and the covering operations performed by them were 1,800(11) Stallion Depot. 31. The Stallion Depot at Moradabad continued to serve as a recuperation depot for stallions that are returned from the different stands in the province. It was also useful for training newly pruchased stallions before being gent out to district stands. (ii) Donkey stallions Table X. 32. At the commencement of the year there were 9 jacks on the roll of the department for mule breeding opera- tions in the province; one was newly purchased, making 10 at the close of the year. Table XI. 33. Nine jacks were employed at the stud during the year. They covered 312 mares at an average of 34.6 per animal as compared with 28.8 in the preceding year. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and shows. 34. Thirty-six important horse and cattle fairs, shows and exhi- bitions were held in the province during the year and were attended by the officers and subordinate staff of the department. In order to give an impetus to horse-breeding and to create more local interest in the industry I held one-day horse shows at Qasimpur (district Budaun), Aonla (district Bareilly), Joya (district Morad- abad), Rae Bareli and Phulpur (district Allahabad), and awarded prizes to brood-mares and the progeny of Government stallions exhi- bited(12) fair and exhibition at Baheri and delivered lectures on contagious diseases and gave demonstrations on castration with the Burdizzo Castrator and also on the treatment of surra. The Hon'ble Premier graced the exhibition by his visit on 15th October, 1937. The staff made arrangement for the treatment of sick animals and for warding off epidemics at fairs and shows as far as possible. They also attended exhibitions held at several places in connexion with the Rural Development work and delivered lectures on the beneficial work of the department in the interest of agriculturists. Veterinary exhibits. 35. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at a number of fairs and shows the chief being the Batesar fair, district Agra, Rural Uplift Exhibition Jarakhar, dis- trict Hamirpur, All-India Industrial and Commercial Exhibition, Agra, Kumbh fair at Hardwar, Dewa fair, district Bara Banki and Ramlila fair and exhibition at Baheri, district Bareilly. CHAPTER VIII PROPOGANDA Propaganda. 36. This section of the department's activities is not financed by Government, thus our form of propaganda con- sists chiefly in the distribution of vernacular pamphlets dealing with the common diseases of animals, lectures are delivered by the members of the department at the different fairs and shows.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces for the year 1938-39 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. I held charge of the department throughout the year and was on tour for 223 days, visiting 72 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and 14 stallion stands in 31 districts. I visited the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, in May, 1938, and the Government Cattle Farms at Bharari, district Jhansi, and Madhurikund, district Muttra, in August and September, 1938, respectively. I visited Poona to purchase stallions for the improvement of horse-breeding industry in the province. I attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at New Delhi in Novem- ber, 1938. I also attended the Animal Husbandry Wing meeting of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and the All-India Cattle Show at New Delhi in February, 1939, and acted as a judge in award- ing prizes. I paid a visit to the Imperial Veterinary Serum Institute at Izatnagar, district Bareilly, and made frequent visits to the Stallion Depot at Moradabad. I organized one-day horse-shows in Hardoi, Saharanpur, Bareilly and Shahjahanpur districts, where I judged animals and awarded prizes to the progeny of Government stallions and brood mares. I also visited Mr. Slater's farm twice during the year and acted as a judge on the occasion of the goat and poultry show held at that Institute. In the last week of March, 1939, I proceeded to Patna to join the Board of Examiners of the Bihar Veterinary College. 2.

Pandit Gajanan Pande took on the duties of Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, on 14th January, 1939, on transfer from Assam; he was on tour for 23 days up to the end of the year visiting 11 districts. His attention was confined to the immunization of cattle and buffaloes against rinderpest with goat tissue virus attenuated with chloroform vapour, acute paramphistomiasis in cattle and goats, contagious abortion in goats, goat-pox and Ranikhet disease in fowls. He attended the third Animal Husbandry Wing meeting of the Im- perial Council of Agricultural Research at Delhi in February, 1939. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality. Table I. 4. Epidemics among live-stock were severe during the year, the reported mortality from contagious diseases increased from 33,992 to 44,992, rinderpest and haemorrhagic septicaemia being responsible for the increase. 5. Deaths from other causes numbered 4,855 as against 5,287 in the preceding year. (a) Equines Table I. 6. The death roll under this head was 445 as compared with 604 in the previous year.
(3) Glanders. four cases of glanders were detected in the districts of Dehra Dun and Cawnpore. The animals were des- troyed and necessary precautionary measures taken. Surra (equines and camels). Considerable attention was paid to this disease and treatment was carried on with necessary modifications applicable in each case. The surra season was, however, healthier this year than in the past due to the paucity of rains in the Western districts of the province. The details are as follows: Name of district Name of treatment centre Number of cases treated 1. Muttra .. .. Surir .. .. 2 2. Etah .. .. Etah .. .. 2 3. Saharanpur .. ..

Twelve cases of poisoning of animals were reported from the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, Agra, Etah and Gorakhpur. The one from Anupshahr in Bulandshahr District was a case of poisoning an elephant. The accused persons have been dealt with legally. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table III. 21. At the commencement of the year there were 187 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Four hospitals were opened during the year at Ramnagar (district Sultanpur), Sisauli (district Muzaffarnagar), Sardhana (district Meerut), and Iglas (district Aligarh). A veterinary dispensary was opened at Haldwani (district Naini Tal) under the charge of the veterinary inspector in the jurisdic- tion of the Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates. The total number at the close of the year was 192. Grants-in-aid for con- struction of veterinary hospitals. 22. Contributions were made to the following local boards during the year for the construction or improvement of veterinary hospital buildings: (1) Saharanpur. (2) Bareilly. (3) Hamirpur. (4) Garhwal. (5) Kheri. (6) Gonda. (7) Jalaun.
(7) CHAPTER V LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK Laboratory work. 23. One thousand one hundred and forty-seven smears were microscopically examined at the central and circle laboratories during the year. The materials vere from bacteriological, pathological and helminthological cases obtained from different species of animals throughout the province. A summary of the results is given below: Laboratory Positive Negative Total Lucknow. . .. .. .. 58 523 581 Agra .. .. .. .. 91 322 413 Allahabad .. .. .. 41 112 153 Total .. 190 957 1,147 Some interesting specimens and parasites received have been pre- served and added to the laboratory museums. Histopathological cases were sent to the Mukteswar laboratory for examination, and parasites for classification to the officer in charge of the Helminthiasis Scheme in the Lucknow University. Anti-rabic treatment. 24. Thirty-seven in-contact cases were dealt with as outdoor patients at the Isolation Wards, Lucknow, and given anti-rabic treatment. Thirteen cases were kept under observation, of which eight developed rabies and died, three were destroyed at the request of the owners and two were discharged after anti-rabic treatment had been completed. Experiments and in- vestigation on diseases. 25. Experimental work was conducted at the Central Laboratory, Lucknow, on further attenuating the goat tissue virus by treating the macerated goat spleen tissue with chloroform vapour, with a view to its use for immunization of buffaloes against rinderpest by scarification method on the inner surface of the car. A separate experiment on the use of "macerated but unchloro- formed spleen tissue vaccine alone" by scarification method in plains cattle has been designed. As this method of vaccination of cattle and buffaloes aims at the introduction of the virus intra-dermally, a small experiment was designed at Hempur Government Cattle Farm, where a few animals were given intra-dermal injection of 0 .5 c.c. of goat
(8) tissue virus emulsified in 0.5 per cent. saline. Both the chloroformed and the unchloroformed vaccines are being subjected to extensive trials by scarification method at the actual scene of outbreak of the disease at various places in the province. An atypical type of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia was observed at the Madhurikund Cattle Farm, Muttra, among the suckling buffalo calves accounting for heavy losses. The diagnosis of the condition was ren- dered difficult in the beginning. Microscopic examination of the material showed bipolar organisms which were confirmed for pasteurellosis by Mukteswar. As ordinary anti-haemorrhagic septicaemia serum was helpful in subsiding the trouble for a short period only, special haemorr- hagic septicaemia vaccine was injected with beneficial results. A similar trouble arose at the R. E. I. Dairy, Dayalbagh, Agra, which was strongly suspected by the dairy authorities for malicious poisoning. Examination of morbid material at the departmental laboratory at Agra and subsequent confirmation by the Mukteswar authorities proved that the trouble was due to pasteurellosis. The disease stopped after repeated serumization of the herd at regular intervals. Experiments designed to ascertain a single minimum dose of Naganol as prophylactic against surra in equines were conducted again during the year. It was observed that a single dose of I gram of the drug was found to give protection against surra to horses and mules during the surra season. This confirms the last year's findings, but as the disease prevailed in a milder form this year also, it is intended to repeat the experiment next year for further confirmation of the results. Experiments on anthrax spore vaccine recently introduced by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for use in cattle and sheep have been conducted on a small scale and the results are awaited. A peculiar trouble suspected to be a cutaneous form of rinderpest was observed amongst young stock of buffaloes at the Government Cattle Farm, Bharari, Jhansi. It was confined to young buffaloes and the Hissar herd remained free from the disease. Inoculation with goat tissue virus reduced the incidence in one of the three herds, but the disease kept on lingering in two of the herds. The material sent to the Mukteswar Institute proved negative for rinderpest and pox. No constant and specific lesions of any etiological significance were seen and the material was also negative for coccidiosis. The investigation will be pursued on the occurrence of the trouble in future. Samples of serum from the cattle of the Agricultural Institute, Allahabad, and from six cows of a local gowala of Aallahabad were sub- jected to agglutination test for evidence of infection with the common causal organism of contagious bovine abortion, namely, brucella abortus, and with the exception of one cow which proved positive in the first
(9) herd the rest proved negative. Samples of serum from 152 goats were collected from the Goat Breeding Farm, Etah, for agglutination test against brucella abortus (Bang) and brucella melitensis. Results revealed only two reactors for both brucella abortus and brucella meli- tensis. At the Government Cattle Farm, Manjhra, district Kheri, three cows showing absence of oestrum for varying periods after calving were successfully treated with hormone obtained from pregnant cows. At the close of the year a number of casualties occurred amongst the Hissar cattle migrated from the Punjab and which were located at Mowana in Meerut District. Investigation furnished overwhelming evidence of helminthic trouble due to immature forms of paramphis- tomes, but malnutrition, mineral and other deficiencies were also res- ponsible for the onset of the condition. Post mortem materials from some of the animals that had succumbed have been submitted to Mukteswar for examination and report. At Bhadri, in Partabgarh District, a similar affection was reported amongst calves. The clinical symptoms were identical and post mor- tem examinations revealed the same immature amphistomes attached to the mucosa of the stomach and intestines. Encouraged by the vaccination of sheep last year, certain owners of flocks at Kosi (Muttra) voluntarily offered their sheep for prophylactic vaccination which was carried out with vaccine obtained from the Mysore Serum Institute. A typical outreak of sheep-pox was noticed at the Agricultural Institute, Allahabad. Segregation measures were adopted and healthy in-contact animals were subjected to prophylactic vaccination with the vaccine obtained from the Mysore Institute. Goat-pox again occurred at the Goat Breeding Farm, Etah, and vaccination with a vaccine newly prepared at Mukteswar was experi- mentally conducted. An outbreak of the same disease was observed at the Raja Sahib of Bhadri's Farm, Partabgarh. The scrapings for- warded to Mukteswar proved positive for goat-pox. Another outbreak of goat-pox was investigated in Chakrata, district Dehra Dun. Scabs and pustular materials from these cases have been sent to the Mukteswar Institute for biological test of the virus. Acute paramphistomiasis in goats was investigated in Mowai, district Bareilly. Inquiries revealed that several owners had lost their entire herds. The clinical symptoms consisted of diarrhoea, emaciation and the presence of oedematous swelling in the region of the throat. Post mortem materials from these cases have been sent to Mukteswar Institute for examination and report. On account of the immature form of parasites anti-helminthic treatment of a few clinical cases did not prove successful.
(10) Prophylactic vaccination against sheep-pox was repeated during the year in the flocks vaccinated in the preceding year at Kosi Kalan, district Muttra. Doyle's disease, known as Ranikhet disease among poultry was investigated at Baheri, district Bareilly, and the United Provinces Poultry Association Farm, Lucknow. Post mortem materials from both the outbreaks forwarded to Mukteswar Institute confirmed the diagnosis as Ranikhet disease. At the United Provinces Poultry As- sociation Farm, control measures being possible, the outbreak was checked by means of segregation, destruction of diseased birds and disinfection of pens etc. An outbreak of the disease was also reported from Kasganj, district Etah, and from Aligarh. Tuberculin tests by the double intra-dermal method were carried out at R. E. I. Dairy, Dayalbagh, Agra, for the detection of the incidence of tuberculosis and Johne's disease with the following results: Number of animals subjected to the test Tuberculosis Johne's disease Remarks Positive Doubtful Positive Doubtful 42 cows .. .. .. 1 .. 2 Research Station. 26. Two thousand six hundred and forty-four cases were treated at the Research Station Hospital, Lucknow. Rupees1,430 were realized towards treatment charges during the year. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Bulls Table-VI-A. 27. At the commencement of the year there were 352 approved bulls at the stud in the districts of Muzaffar- nagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partab- garh. Ninety-six bulls were added during the year and there were 19 casualties, the number at the close of the year was 429. (ii) Buffalo bulls Table VI-B. 28. The year commenced with 99 buffalo bulls at stud in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Buland- shahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh. Six animals were added during the year, the number of casualties was 19. The number left at the close of the year was 86.
(11) (iii) Horse stallions Table VI-C. 29. The year began with 56 stallions on the roll for horse breeding in the non-selected districts of the province. Six stallions were purchased during the year, 3 were sold and 2 destroyed, leaving 57 at the close of the year. The number of mares covered was 1,704. 30. The progeny of Government stallions is showing improvement which was evidenced at the different horse fairs and shows held during the year. Stallion Depot. 31. The Stallion Depot at Moradabad continues to be useful for rest and treatment for stallions coming from the districts. It also serves as a training centre for newly purchased stallions before sending them to the different studs. (iv) Donkey stallions Table VI-C. 32. There were 10 jacks at the beginning of the year; one was destroyed leaving 9 at the end of the year. The number of coverings during the year was 301. Stallion Stands. 33. No new stallion stand was opened during the year. The stand at Rampura, district Jalaun, has been closed from 12th September, 1938. The question of opening two donkey stands in Cawnpore and Bareilly districts is under correspondence. CHAPTER VII FAIRS AND SHOWS Fairs and Shows. Table VII. 34. Thirty-five important cattle and horse fairs, shows and exhibi- tions were held during the year and were attend- ed by the officers of the department, who judged and distributed prizes in their respective circles. Besides these fairs and shows, the subordinate staff attended the district exhibitions at Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh, Nauchandi Fair, district Meerut, Indigenous Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Etah, Rural Uplift Exhibition at villages Chirauri, district Meerut, Gauri, district Aligarh, Mahewa, Bakewar and Ajitmal, dis- trict Etawah, Rural Development Devi Fair at Mainpuri, Cattle Fair, Shikohabad, district Mainpuri and Singhirampur, district Farrukhabad. Arrangements were made at these fairs for the treatment of sick animals and for safeguarding against outbreaks of contagious diseases amongst animals brought to the fairs. Exhibitions held at several places in connexion with rural development work were also attended by the staff and lectures were delivered on the activities of the depart- ment and its benefits to all stock owners.
(12) In order to encourage the horse breeding industry one-day horse shows were organized at Qasimpur, district Budaun, Dhaighat and Khandar, district Shahjahanpur, Makanpur, district Cawnpore, Bhag- wanpur, Dewalheri, Pandu-Kheri, Harpaly, Ghana Khandi and Doodhla, district Saharanpur, Aonla, district Bareilly, and Hardoi. Prizes were awarded to good brood-mares and the progeny of Govern- ment stallions. Veterinary exhibits. 35. Veterinary exhibits were displayed at a number of fairs and shows, the chief were the Batesar Fair, district Agra, Rural Uplift Exhibitions at Bharwa Sumerpur, district Hamirpur, Gantholi, district Muttra, Bharthana, district Etawah, Dewa Fair, district Bara Banki, Kotdwara and Haldwani Exhibitions, district Garhwal and Naini Tal respectively, and the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition at Bijnor. A veterinary stall was erected at Lucknow at the Swadeshi Ex- hibition, opened by the President of the Indian National Congress, and the Health Exhibition organized by the Anti-Tuberculosis League. The stall was much appreciated by the visitors. CHARTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 36. The department having had no financial support from Gov- ernment for propaganda work, the activities of the department were mainly restricted to the distribution of pamphlets on diseases in the languages of the province and the giving of lectures on the different cattle diseases by the mem- bers of the staff at the various fairs and shows. A set of magic lantern slides of departmental importance has been prepared and lectures illustrated by the slides aroused great interest among the rural public. Some useful propaganda work was done at the meetings held in connexion with the Rural Development Week. CHAPTER IX PROPAGANDA Expenditure. Table IX. 37. The total expenditure of the department during the year under review was Rs.5,08,115 against Rs.4,36,118 in the last year. The receipts for the year were Rs.1,40,414 against Rs.1,33,347 in the previous year.

Veterinary Inspectors toured on an average for 181 days in the year. They visited 3,204 villages during their tours. CHAPTER XI GENERAL REMARKS 43. The compounders' training class having been suspended during the year, a six-months course was started at the Research Station, Lucknow, for training stock-men in elementary veterinary science, animal husbandry, first aid etc. Seventeen men qualified and have been appointed in the different districts as assistants to the subordinate veterinary staff in connexion with rural development work.
(15) 44. By the retirement of Mr. Muhammad Tahir Mirza, Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Allahabad Circle, on 16th September, 1938, the department lost an officer of experience. He commenced service as a veterinary assistant surgeon and finished his official career as a Circle Superintendent. 45. The department took over the control and improvement of live-stock work in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh from the Agriculture Department on 1st Nov- ember, 1938. A certain amount of difficulty was experienced in re- cruiting the necessary staff to undertake these extra responsibilities, but the full complement has now been entertained and success in the enterprise is visualized. 46. To prevent the further export of Jumnapari goats from these provinces which was endangering their extinction, a scheme was introduced in the area where the breed was found in its pure state. The scheme was based on a system of granting a monthly subsidy to the owners of small flocks of pure Jumnapari goats on the condition that the owners utilized their animals for breeding purposes and Government having the option of purchasing all young stock for re-distribution in the neighbouring districts. The animals subsidized are identified by a tattoo mark on the inner aspect of the ear. When the objects of the scheme are thoroughly understood and appreciated it is hoped that the desired results will be produced and to the benefit of the industry generally in the province. 47. A small experiment was started in the Jalaun District with a view to improving the wool of the indigenous sheep. Two hundred of the best local ewes were purchased and six Bikaner rams obtained from the Hissar Farm. The experiment will be watched with interest. 48. The resources of the already inadequate veterinary staff were heavily taxed during the year by the migration of a large number of cattle from the famine areas of the Punjab to these provinces, yet hospitals and camps were arranged in the different districts where these large herds were located and prompt measures were taken to deal with all evidence of disease which occurred. The organization and the conduct of the staff in the face of difficulties and lack of facili- ties is commendable. 49. The Special Tract Scheme in the Agra District continued to do useful work inasmuch as outbreaks of contagious diseases were fewer during the year as compared with those of the previous year. 50. The Rinderpest Vaccine Centre at Lucknow progresses satis- factorily and much useful work is done year after year. The new method of inoculation by scarification with attenuated goat tissue virus, both chloroformed and unchloroformed, is being tried at the
(16) Actual scene of outbreak of the disease, the aim is to dispense with th use of serum gradually. Continued experiments are necessary before drawing up a definite conclusion. 51. For help rendered to the staff in advancing the interest or preventive inoculation, sanads were awarded to four persons, one in Hamirpur District and three in Saharanpur District. 52. With the expansion of departmental activities clerical work has increased in proportion and needs to be brought up to a strength that will ensure an equal and reasonable share of responsibility on all members. It is hoped that Government will implement the recom- mendation made in this connexion at an early date. 53. My thanks are due to the gazetted and non-gazetted officers of the department for their loyal co-operation and efficient work, also to the members of the office staff, who in spite of extra duties entailing long hours, performed their duties ungrudgingly and efficiently.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, for the year 1939-40 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. I held charge of the department throughout the year and was on tour for 208 days, inspecting 69 veterinary hospitals and dis- pensaries and 14 stallion stands in 27 districts. I attended the 19th meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in May, 1939, at Simla, and the 20th meeting held at New- Delhi in November and December, 1939. At Simla in August, 1939, I discussed with the Director of Remounts, Army Headquarters, problems connected with the transfer to the department of horse- breeding operations in certain selected districts of the province, viz. Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh. I visited Poona and Bombay in October and December, 1939, respectively to pur- chase stallions for the improvement of the horse-breeding industry in the province, and organized one-day horse shows in Allahabad, Bareilly, Hardoi, Saharanpur, Shahjahanpur and Rae Bareli districts, where I judged and awarded prizes to the progeny of Government stallions and brood mares. With a view to improve the sheep and goat industry in the province I made a survey of the sheep areas in Chakrata Tahsil, district Dehra Dun, visited Bodhpura Sheep Farm in Jalaun district and the Goat Mission Farm, Etah, where necessary instructions were issued with regard to the care and rearing of animals and their progeny. In this connexion I also attended the Goat Show organized by the department at Chakarnagar, district Etawah, and awarded prizes to the owners of the best Jumnapari goats collected at the show. I visited an inoculation camp veterinary hospital in the Allahabad District, held a Cattle Show at Babuganj, district Partabgarh, and attended the All-India Cattle Show at New Delhi, in February, 1940, and acted as judge. During the same month I attended the Poultry and Goat Show at the Mission Poultry Farm, Etah, and made frequent visits to the Stallion Depot at Moradabad whenever necessary. In March, 1940, I proceeded to Calcutta to join the Board of Examiners of the Bengal Veterinary College. 2. The touring and inspection work done by the three Circle Superintendents of the department is detailed below:( 2 ) Circle Superintendents Number of days on tour Number of veterinary dispensa- ries ins- pected Number of fairs and shows attended Number of stallion stands inspected Mr. Ram Swarup, officiating Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Agra, from 15th December, 1939 to 14th January, 1940. 23 9 .. 2 Mr. Syed Salman Hasan Naqvi, officia- ting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Allahabad, from 1st April, 1939 to 31st March, 1940. 205 65 10 8 Sardar Sahib S. Udam Singh, officiating Superintendent, Agra Circle, was on leave on average pay for 1 month from 15th December, 1939, to 14th January, 1940, and Mr. Ram Swarup, Veterinary Inspector, officiated as Superintendent during the period he was on leave. 3. Mr. P. G. Pandey, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the office of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, for the entire period of the year under report, he remained on tour for 179 days and visited 32 villages in 15 districts in connexion with the investigation into and the treatment of animal diseases. During the period under review he devoted special attention to perfecting the scarification method of vaccinating cattle and buffaloes against rinderpest, diag- nosis of Johne's disease and tuberculosis, investigation into "Bisi" in domesticated ruminants, surra in bovines and equines, sheep and goat diseases, Ranikhet disease in fowls, and fodder poisoning in cattle. A separate annual report submitted by this officer to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research deals in detail with the work done during the year under report. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality. Table I. 4. Epidemics among live-stock were less severe during the year under report than last year. The re- ported mortality from contagious diseases was 42,349 as against 44,992 in the preceding year. Haemorrhagic septicaemia, blackquarter and anthrax were responsible for the decrease. 5. Deaths from other causes numbered 4,650 as compared with 4,855 in the previous year. (a) Equines Table I. 6. The death-roll under this head was 413 as against 445 in the previous year.
( 3 ) Glanders. One case of death from glanders occurred during the year in Cawn- pore city and two cases were suspected in Bareilly and Naini Tal districts, these, however, proved negative to mallein test and were released. Surra (equines and camels). Experiments on the prophylaxis of surra were continued during the year but due to scanty rainfall and consequent lack of vectors which limited the spread of the disease this work was not concluded. Details of the work done are as follows :( 4 ) Anthrax. Two cases of anthrax, one from the district of Gorakhpur and one from Sultanpur district, were reported during the year under report. Other contagious di- sease. Fifty-seven cases of deaths were reported under this head as against 106 in the preceding year. These included tetanus, piroplasmosis and other parasitic dis- eases. Other causes. Deaths from other causes were reported to be 317 as compared with 254 last year. (b) Bovines Rinderpest. Table I. 7. The mortality reported from rinderpest was 27,944 as against 27,360 in the preceding year. All the districts in the province were affected, the highest number of deaths occurred in the Allahabad district where 2,210 cases were reported of which 1,309 were buffaloes. Anti-rinderpest ino- culations. Table II. 8. Inoculations against rinderpest were undertaken in 2,119 outbreaks during this year as compared with 1,947 in the previous year. The details are as fol- lows:( 5 ) Anthrax. Tables I and II. 12. The disease was reported from 21 districts and the mortality recorded was 450 as against 998 the previous year. The disease assumed a comparatively mild form this year and the highest mortality was 55 in Mirzapur District. The number of inoculations carried out was as follows :( 6 ) CHAPTER III NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES Table III. 20. The number of cases treated at the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries was 5,79,294 as compared with 5,29,761 in the previous year. Cases supplied with medicines but not brought to hospitals numbered 87,302 as against 85,940 in the year preceding. Tables III and IV. 21. The number of cases treated by veterinary assistant surgeons while on tour was 1,29,632 as against 1,13,253 in the last year. Elimination of scrub bulls by scientific method of castration numbered 1,52,501 as against 1,25,571 in the previous year. Cattle poisoning. 22. Nine cases of poisoning in animals were reported from the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Buland- shahr, Agra, Shahjahanpur, Gorakhpur, Unao, Sitapur and Kheri. The accused persons were dealt with in the law courts. CHAPTER IV VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Table III. 23. At the beginning of the year there were 192 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Three new veteri- nary hospitals were opened during the-year at (1) Khatima, in the Tarai and Bhabar Govern- ment Estates, district Naini Tal, (2) Kotdwara, under the Kham Bhabar Estates and (3) Thakurdwara, district Mo- radabad, under the District Board. The veterinary hospital at Hal- dwani, under the District Board, Naini Tal, has been removed to Bhim- tal as a veterinary dispensary was opened last year at Haldwani under the charge of the Veterinary Inspector, Tarai and Bhabar Government Estates. The veterinary dispensary at Dhaurehra, district Kheri, has been temporarily closed during the year for want of a veterinary assistant surgeon. The total number of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the close of the year was 194. Grants-in-aid for construction of veterinary hospitals. 24. No contribution could be made to district boards for the con- struction or improvement of existing veterinary hospital buildings during the year, owing to lack of funds. CHAPTER V LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK Laboratory work. 25. Microscopical examination of 1,072 specimens including smears was conducted during the year at the Central and Circle laboratories. These were of bacteriological, pathological and helminthological nature obtained from different species of animals.
( 7 ) A summary of the results is as follows:( 8 ) caused by the presence of innumerable immature paramphistomes, these parasites cause a similar affection in cattle. In the treatment of this condition favourable results have been obtained by 1 to 2 c. c. of carbon tetrachloride in linseed oil for sheep and goats, and 5 to 10 ounces of 1 per cent. solution of copper sulphate for cattle. At the Sheep Farm at Bodhpura, district Jalaun, a form of pneu- monia complicated by the appearance of sheep-pox prevailed in June, 1939, amongst the Bikaneri and Jalauni sheep. The condition was very mild in the beginning but later it assumed a severe form causing 60 deaths. The complicating feature in this outbreak was a pneumonia of pasteurella and corynebacterial type which had prevailed prior to the sheep-pox symptoms. In July, 1939, 155 sheep were immunized with serum-sensitised vaccine prepared in the field. Local reactions at the seat of inocula- tion and fever developed in all the vaccinated sheep a week after vaccination. The same flock of sheep and their progeny were re-vaccinated in March, 1940, with the vaccine obtained from Mysore Serum Institute, Bangalore. None of the vaccinated sheep showed any reaction which supported the belief that the immunity conferred by the first vaccination had persisted. Research station. 28. Two thousand six hundred and sixty-seven cases were treated at the Research Station Hospital, Lucknow, during the year under report as against 2,644 in the preceding year. Rupees nine hundred and five were realized towards treatment charges and credited to Government. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS (i) Bulls Table VIA. 29. The year commenced with 483 approved bulls at the stud in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bu- landshahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh. Two hun- dred and thirty-seven bulls were added during the year, there were 73 casualties. The number at the close of the year was 647. (ii)Buffaloe bulls Table VIB. 30. At the commencement of the year there were 32 buffaloe bulls at the stud in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partab- garh. Two were added and there were 8 casualties, leaving 26 at the close of the year. (iii) Horse stallions Table VIC. 31. There were 57 stallions on the roll at the beginning of the year in the non-selected districts of the province. Eleven stallions were purchased during the year and 20 were received from the Army Remount Department conse-
( 9 ) quent upon the transfer of horse-breeding operations in the selected districts (Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr and Aligarh) to this department. Six stallions were sold and 2 were destroyed as unfit for stud purposes. The number of stallions at the close of the year was 80. The number of mares served was 2,027. 32. The progeny of Government stallions continues to show improvement as was evident at the different fairs and shows held from time to time in the provinces during the year. Stallion depot. 33. The accommodation at the Stallion Depot at Moradabad has been extended for stabling the extra stallions received from the Army Remount Department and for affording rest and treatment, to stallions returning from the districts for convalescence. (iv) Donkey stallions Table VIC. 34. The year commenced with 9 jacks on the roll; there were no purchases or casualties during the year. The number, therefore, remained the same at the end of the year. The number of their coverings was 237. Stallion stands. 35. The stallion stand at Phulpur, district Allahabad, was closed during the year and a new stand was opened at Bahraich. The stallion stand at Ramnagar, district Bara Banki, has been replaced by a new stand at Ganeshpur in the same district. The stallion stand at Singha, district Bijnor, was closed in April, 1939, due to the lack of interest displayed in horse breeding by the Darindah( 10 ) The number of sheep on the farm at the end of the year under report was as follows:( 11 ) CHAPTER VIII PROPAGANDA Propaganda. 42. By way of propaganda veterinary exhibits were displayed at a number of fairs and shows, the chief being the Batesar Fair, district Agra, Indigenous Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Etah, Industrial and Agricul- tural Exhibition, Dehra Dun, the Cattle Fair and Exhibition at Bhagwan- pur, district Saharanpur, the exhibition held in connexion with Rural Development Week in Muttra District, Goat Show at Chakarnagar, district Etawah, Ajodhya Exhibition, district Fyzabad, Makanpur Fair, district Cawnpore, Dhaurehra Fair, district Kheri, Khairabad Fair, district Sitapur and Gauriya Kalan Fair, district Unao. De- partmental films on the control of rinderpest, and exhibitions of good breeds of cattle were screened at Batesar Fair, Balwant Rajput College, Agra, the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition, Dehra Dun and Makanpur Fair, district Cawnpore. The film shows attracted great interest and much useful propaganda work was done in this way. At one-day cattle shows lectures were delivered on the care and management of cattle and the methods to be adopted necessary for the improvement of the breed. Pamphlets on different diseases of animals in the languages of the province were distributed, practical demonstrations of castration by Burdizzo method were given and models of foot-baths were shown to the people. These shows were successful both from the point of entries and the interest taken. CHAPTER IX EXPENDITURE Expenditure. Table IX. 43. The total expenditure of the department during the year under report was Rs.5,14,775 as against Rs.5,08,115 in the year preceding. The receipts for the year were Rs.l,31,456 as against Rs.1,40,414 in the previous year. CHAPTER X ESTABLISHMENT 44. The superior staff consisted of:( 12 ) Casualties in the staff. 45. There were 11 retirements, 5 resignations, and one death among the subordinate staff of the department, a total of 17 casualties during the year. Lectures on live- stock welfare and epi- demic diseases. 46. The subordinate staff delivered educative lectures in different schools and training classes etc. as follows:( 13 ) Training. 47. One veterinary assistant surgeon underwent a refresher course at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, during the year and 32 candidates were selected and sent to the Bengal, Bihar and Punjab Veterinary Colleges for training as United Provinces stipendiaries. Forty-seven men qualified as stockmen and were posted to dif- ferent districts to assist the subordinate veterinary staff in connexion with rural development work and disease control. Tours of Veterinary Inspectors. 48. Veterinary Inspectors toured on an average for 160 days in the year, visiting 3,552 villages during their tours. CHAPTER XI GENERAL REMARKS Improvement in reporting of diseases. 49. There was an improvement during the year in the system of reporting diseases by village patwaris and rural development organizations. In districts where settlement operations were continued and where the services of patwaris were not always available, the reporting of diseases was entrusted to village mukhias. This agency, together with the employment of village chaukidars recently introduced in certain districts, is likely to prove a valuable adjunct to our system of reporting outbreaks of disease in villages. Special tract scheme. 50. The veterinary assistant surgeons working in connexion with the special tract scheme did useful work in checking the spread of cattle contagious diseases as these occurred. It was considered advantageous to treat this staff as a more mobile unit and their services were transferred from Agra to Meerut district in October, 1939, to check abnormal outbreaks of live-stock epidemics there, and later to Lucknow for a similar purpose. Rural development work. 51. The staff continued to pay particular attention to live-stock diseases in the rural development villages. They attended meetings in connexion with rural development work and suggested improvements in matters relating to the activities of the department. Pamphlets dealing with common contagious diseases of animals were distributed in the rural development villages and lectures were delivered on veterinary first-aid and subjects dealing with cattle welfare and animal health problems in general. Migration of cattle from outside the prov- ince. 52. Consequent on the persistence of famine conditions in Hissar and in adjoining districts a large number of cattle migrated from the Punjab to these prov- inces. Three veterinary assistant surgeons were deputed from the Punjab to help to control disease among these cattle, they returned to their own province in June, 1939.
( 14 ) Migration of cattle from outside the prov- ince. 53. As the result of similar conditions prevailing in Rajputana, several thousand head of cattle migrated for grazing to the forest areas of these provinces. This large migration of half-starved stock was responsible for the spread of disease among the neighbouring herds thus adding considerably to the already heavy responsibilities of the district staff in coping with the animal health problems in these provinces. Four thousand five hundred and twenty-nine of these animals were immunized against rinderpest. Abolition of Imperial horse breeding in the selected districts. 54. With the abolition of Imperial horse breeding in the selected districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Buland- shahr and Aligarh the department took over charge of horse breeding in the whole of the province from February, 1940. Cattle breeding in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh. 55. Cattle-breeding operations in the districts of Meerut, Muzaf- farnagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh continued to be controlled by the department. The subordinate staff consisting of veterinary inspectors, veterinary assistant surgeons and stockmen carried out vigorous propaganda to improve the breeds of cattle in these districts. Progress was, unfortunately, not as rapid as it might have been owing to the delay in supplying stud bulls from Government farms due to the prevalence of contagious diseases. It is hoped that more adequate veterinary arrangements will be provided on those farms, as has so frequently been pointed out by this de- partment, the observance of sounder principles of preventive medicine and animal sanitation would be an advantage to the administration. Awardal of sanads. 56. In recognition of the help rendered by Chaudhri Tara Chand, son of Mr. Sis Ram, President of Ailum Com- mittee, district Muzaffarnagar, in advancing the interest of preventive inoculation in his village, a departmental sanad was awarded to him during the year. Appreciation of assis- tance from officers and staff. 57. I record my appreciation of the assistance received from all officers and staff of the department who carried out their duties conscientiously during the year and in particular those members who were engaged in cattle-breeding duties in the west of the province. The undermentioned officers of the department are deserving of special mention: (1) Sardar Sahib S. Udam Singh, officiating Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, Agra. (2) M. Abdul Jamil, Veterinary Inspector, Tissue Virus Section. (3) S. Udey Singh Sidhu, Veterinary Inspector, Training Class, Lucknow. (4) M. Mohammad Ishaq, Veterinary Inspector, Incharge Government Stallion Depot, Moradabad. T. J. EGAN, Director, Veterinary Services, United Provinces.

Page 7, line 1(Maximum limit of report( ii ) CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS I( iii ) LIST OF APPENDICES Table no. Pages IAnnual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, for the year 1940-41 CHAPTER I GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 1. I held charge of the department throughout the year. I was on tour for 223 days, visiting 72 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and 28 stallion stands in 33 districts. I visited Poona in the months of August and September, 1940, to purchase stallions for the improvement of horse breeding in the province. I attended the 22nd meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at New Delhi and the 4th meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agricul- ture and Animal Husbandry in India held at Izatnagar in November, 1940. I visited the Government Cattle Farm at Bainpur and Jagrajpur Cattle Welfare Centre in Agra district, and in company with the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India, the dairy and milk collecting centre of the Lucknow Co-operative Milk Supply Union. 1 also inspected the Circle Offices at Allahabad and Agra. I attended the annual horse fairs and shows at Aligarh, Bulandshahr and Muzaffarnagar, the poultry show at Jalesar, district Etah, the All- India Cattle and Poultry Show at Delhi, the Goat Show at Chakarnagar, district Etawah, and the one-day cattle shows at Iglas and Gabhana in the Aligarh district. I organized, judged and awarded prizes to the selected exhibits at the one-day horse shows held at Dewalheri, Doodhla and Pandukheri in Saharanpur district. I also accompanied the Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India during his tour in the Sahson and Chakarnagar area in the Etawah district in connexion with the subsidising of Jumnapari goats in those areas. I paid frequent visits to the Stallion Depot at Moradabad and the Sheep Farm at Bodhpura, district Jalaun, and gave instructions to the staff concerned in connexion with the activities carried out at these institutions. I also served on the Examining Boards of the Bihar and Bengal Vete- rinary Colleges in the months of April, 1940, and March, 1941, respec- tively. 2. The touring and inspection work done by the three Circle Super- intendents of the department is as follows :( 2 ) 3. Mr. P. G. Pandey, M.SC., M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the office of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, throughout the year. He remained on tour for 120 days and visited 20 districts in connexion with the investigation and treatment of animal diseases. CHAPTER II TREATMENT OF DISEASES Contagious diseases Mortality( 3 ) Anti rinderpest in- oculations(4) Other causes( 5 ) tions controlled by the department during the year. The total number of veterinary hospitals and dispensaries at the close of the year was 197. Grant-in-aid for the construction or im- provement of veteri- nary hospitals. 23. Owing to the financial stringency due to War conditions no con- tribution could be made to the local bodies during the year for the coustruction or improvement of veterinary hospitals and buildings, CHAPTER V LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK Laboratory Work. 24. Nine hundred and eighty-one specimens and smears of a bacterio- logical, pathological and helminthological nature were examined microscopically at the Central and Circle Laboratories. Bacteriological, histopathological, helminthic and other biological cases were sent to the Mukteswar Laboratory for examination. Anti-rabic treatment. 25. Twenty-three incontact cases were treated with anti-rabic vaccine as outdoor patients at the Isolation Ward, Lucknow. Three dogs were kept under observation as in-door patients, one of which manifested symptoms of rabies and died on the 6th day, the other two were discharged. Seven dogs received anti-rabic treat- ment as in-door patients. Two dogs showing positive symptoms of the disease were destroyed at the request of the owners. Experiments and in- vestigation on diseases. 26. Results of particular interest and value to field workers in the province have been achieved in connection with the treatment of 'Bisi" in sheep and goats, the pro- phylactic and curative treatment of bovine surra by potassium antimony tartarate, and the scarification method of vaccination of cattle and buffaloes against rinderpest. Research Station. 27. Two thousand six hundred and eighty cases were treated at the Research Station Hospital, Lucknow, during the year under report as against 2,667 in the preceding year. The treatment charges realised and credited to Government amounted to Rs. 814. CHAPTER VI BREEDING OPERATIONS 1. Cattle-breeding 28, Cattle-breeding operations in the districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Partabgarh are under the charge of this department. The number of bulls and buffalo bulls at the stud in these districts during the year was as follows:( 6 ) 29. In order to give an impetus to local breeders 27 one-day cattle shows were organized in these districts and a sum of Rs. 4,537 was award- ed as prizes to the owners of good cows and the progeny of Government bulls. It is encouraging to note that the shows were very popular and the collection of exhibits at each show was an improvement in quality and quantity on previous years. In village Amarpur, district Meerut, an influential zamindar also contributed in cash and kind in awarding prizes to winners. The shows provided an opportunity for the departmental officers as well as the breeders to see the improvement made in young stock through the agency of Government bulls. Lectures were also deli- vered on the principles of live-stock improvement and leaflets on various aspects of better animal husbandry practices were distributed among breeders. The standard of graded up stock has appreciably improved in most of the localities in these districts. Seven bulls, the progeny of Government stud bulls, were purchased at the one-day cattle shows in Meerut district and issued for stud purposes to suitable localities in the same district. It is hoped that this practice will create greater interest in the rearing of good stock and in future years it is anticipated that a larger number of calves will be available for this purpose, thereby reducing the number of purchases from the Punjab. II( 7 ) A large number of high class mares, two years olds young stock was seen at these district shows, particularly at Aligarh and Bulandshahr. A sum of Rs.6,434 was realized during the year on account of branding and covering fees and credited to Government. In order to encourage horse breeding in the remaining districts 9 one-day horse shows were held at Dewalheri, Doodhla and Pandukheri in Saharanpur district, Etah, Qasimpur in Budaun district, Katra and Khandar in Shahjahanpur district, Aonla in Bareilly district and Babuganj in Partabgarh district, and a sum of Rs. 1,022 was awarded in prizes. III( 8 ) breeders who were invited to attend the farm on the occasion of these functions. The farm was unfortunate in having 4 visitations of sheep-pox during the year. This caused a severe set back to our breeding programme and accounted for 60 seizures and 34 deaths. Ovination was carried out with a vaccine prepared by the Mysore Serum Institute twice, but the results were not satisfactory and offered no protection against the disease. The Deputy Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, deputed an officer in December, 1940, to investigate the disease. A vaccine was prepared at the Institute and 150 sheep were vaccinated on the 27th and 28th January, 1941. No fresh outbreak has occurred after this vaccination. The number of sheep on the farm at the end of the year under report was as follows :( 9 ) Lectures were delivered by the members of the staff on the different cattle diseases, and pamphlets were distributed dealing with the same in the languages of the province. CHAPTER IX EXPENDITURE Expenditure - Table IX. 39. The total expenditure of the department during the year under report was Rs.5,29,248 against Rs.5,14,775 in the year preceding. The receipts for the year amounted to Rs. 1,33,597 against Rs. 1,31,456 in the previous year. CHAPTER X ESTABLISHMENT 40. The superior staff consisted of: ( 10 ) Besides, 28, 605 lectures on improvement of cattle and cattle diseases were delivered by the staff of the department in the rural development villages. Training. 43. Two veterinary assistant surgeons underwent post-graduate training at the Imperial Veterinary Research Insti- tute, Mukteswar, during the year( 11 ) Awardal of sanads. 48. In recognition of the help rendered by Babu Chidda Singh, son of Babu Kunwar Singh of village Rathgaon, district Etawah, in advancing the interest of inoculation during the year a sanad was awarded to him by the department. Pandit Bhola Datt, Patwari of Walla-Boraroe and Thakur Kusal Singh, Rural Development Organizer, Someshwar, district Almora, ren- dered valuable assistance to the staff of the department in carrying out treatment of. cattle in the locality, which was very much appreciated. Migration of cattle from outside the prov- ince. 49. No unusual activity has been reported during the year in connec- tion with the migration of cattle from outside the province to the grazing areas of the United Provinces. Rinderpest vaccine manufacturing centre. 50. The rinderpest vaccine centre at Lucknow was busily engaged in the production of vaccine during the year ; 307,025 doses of vaccine were issued in different forms to the various centres for the control of rinderpest in the province. Further experiments conducted on the scarification method of vaccination yielded results to justify its adoption on a large scale in the field. 51. I wish to record my appreciation of the services the staff of this section has rendered during the year and for the promptness with which the demands for vaccine were met on all occasions. I also wish to record my appreciation of the services rendered by the staff incharge of live-stock improvement in the Western districts of the province who, under the guidance of the Circle Superintendent, Sardar Sahib S. Udam Singh, worked to my entire satisfaction. Also I acknowledge the services rendered by the senior members of my office and camp staff who worked hard and conscientiously during the year. T. J.

On completion of the special course of poultry training at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, Mr. S. H. Qureshi took over his duties as Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry) in these Provinces on 13th February, 1942, he was on tour for 28 days during the year. In accordance with the programme of work, as approved by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, his work is so far confined to a survey of the poultry problems in the Province before undertaking any concrete investigation in collaboration with the Research Officer (Poultry) at Mukteswar. 46. The scheme sanctioned in the previous year to utilize the services of village mukhias in addition to patwaries for reporting cattle diseases was dropped for financial reasons, except in districts where settlement, record or revision operations are in progress. Special Tract Scheme. 47. The Special Tract Scheme was made permanent during the year and the staff employed did very useful work in the immunisation of cattle against contagious diseases in the Meerut circle.
( 10 ) Rural Development work. 43. The cattle welfare unit scheme is operating throughout the Province in areas selected in colloboration with the District Rural Development Associations. One hundred and sixty-nine stockmen were employed at the close of the year as against 181 sanctioned, Necessary steps are being taken to complete the sanctioned strength. The following duties were carried out by the staff in the rural develop- ment villages : (1) Villages visited .. .. 29,215 (2) Outbreaks attended .. .. .. 5,123 (3) Inoculations performed .. .. .. 2,72,032 (4) Castrations done .. .. .. 64,147 (5) Cases treated .. .. .. .. 2,10,547 (C) Lectures delivered .. .. .. .. 38,891 (7) Exhibitions attended .. .. 297 (8) Foot-baths constrncted .. .. .. 291 Awardal of Sanad. 49. A certificate was awarded to Mr, Kanhai Singh, mukhia, Jagraj- pur, district Agra, in recognition of assistance given by him in advancing the cause of inoculation among cattle and other departmental activities. Rinderpest Vaccine Centre. 50. The Rinderpest Vaccine Centre at Lucknow issued 4,21,950 doses of vaccine for the control of rinderpest in the Province as against 3,07,025 doses in the previous year. Six brews of dry goat-spleen vaccine were manufactured during the year. The preliminary experiments to determine the potency and immunising value of this type of vaccine would indicate that the product possesses high antigenic value. Large- scale experiments are in progress with this vaccine so as to ensure its safety for general use in the field. Appreciation of assis- tance from officers and staff. 51. I acknowledge the good work done by circle officers and the district staff in preserving a high standard of health among live-stock in their respective circles. I also acknowledge the contribution made towards this end by the members of the stuff of the vaccine centre at Lucknow whose product maintained a high standard of efficacy during the year. Also, I wish to record my appreciation of the assistance given by the senior clerks and the camp staff of my office who worked to my entire satisfaction during the year. T. J.
