THE work of the Department continued to make progress during the year although handicapped by dearth of veterinary graduates to fill vacancies ; I have addressed Government on this subject. The following new appoint- ments have been made, viz.:( 2 ) Patna Tramway and the removal of Jehandad Khan's stables have had a detri- mental effect on the number of admissions of in-patients. A Committee has been appointed to supervise the Veterinary Dispensary; it is said to take a moderate interest in the Institution. 9. Gaya.( 3 ) 20. Monghyr.( 4 ) Angul and Puri, where disease occurred, no doubt, but was not reported. Table XX shows that 42,302 head of cattle were attacked, of which 9,529 are reported to have died. A comparison with the last year's figures will show that the numbers under the headings of "Rinderpest" and "other diseases" are less, while those under the heading of "foot and mouth disease" are greater than those of last year ; the total number shows an increase. Temporary aid was given to Jessore, Khulna, Alipore Central Jail, Presidency Jail, Bhagalpur Central Jail, Darjeeling, Backergunge, Chittagong, Midnapore and to the Commissariat Department at Siliguri. In the majority of these places anti-rinderpest inoculations were performed, while in others, advice as to preventive measures was given. ANTI-RINDERPEST INOCULATION. 32. In pursuance of the Government of India's orders, 15 Veterinary Assistants were sent up to the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Bareilly to receive training in the process of inoculation, and they were all passed by the Imperial Bacteriologist as competent for inoculation work. 33. Nine thousand four hundred and fifty-four (9,454) head of cattle were immunised this year against 11,472 of last year (Table XXIII). There was no friction or misunderstanding of any kind between the operators and the owners. The supply of serum broke down several times, which had an unfortunate effect upon the operations. The want of staff Veterinary Assistants (of whom only one could be appointed instead of four) made itself felt. EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 34. Besides the usual work, which must constantly go on in an Institu- tion like the Bengal Veterinary College, investigations were carried out in various places in the mufassal for the purpose of diagnosing outbreaks of disease in cattle and horses. 35. The Piroplasma Bigeminum, the presence of which in the cattle of India was reported by me on the 25th September 1898, continues to be found when looked for in suitable cases. I observe that the Imperial Bacteriologist also found it in various animals in 1902. CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS. 36. I attended the Sonepore, Kalimpong, Suri and Sitamarhi fairs. Barrahpur fair was not held owing to prevalence of plague in the Shahabad and neighbouring districts. Another new show which was started during the year at Rajnagar in Bachour was also visited by me. I could not attend Khagra and Bihta shows owing to other important engagements; they were visited by the Inspectors of this Department. My report upon the effect of the Imperial prizes, during the last three years, is under consideration of Government. CATTLE BREEDING. 37. At the request of the Inspector-General of Agriculture the purchase of cattle for the Pusa Farm has been undertaken by this Department. With this object I toured in parganas which have the reputation of breeding good cattle. I found a great scarcity of suitable animals. During my temporary absence in Bombay, the people in Bachour imagined that my men intended to poison the wells with plague, with the result that my camps and assistants had to be withdrawn. My second Inspector, who was detailed to collect informa- tion about cattle, is now prostrated by serious illness; but the first Inspector has been carrying on the work as far as practicable without interfering with other duties. HORSE AND PONY BREEDING. 38. Hathwa.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE For the year 1903-1904. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] THE STUDENTS. 1. Class A.( 6 ) worth while to note that the number of cruelty cases sent here for treatment was very small considering the thousands which are said to be brought before the Magistrates. The percentage of deaths was 5.32 against 5.53 last year. Seven hundred and twenty-three (723) operations were performed against 623 last year. The number of horses shod at the forge was 394 against 336 last year. 9. Three corrugated iron sheds to accommodate 150 more cattle and an operation theatre for cattle have been constructed and a suitable water- supply laid on in the Annexe. This Annexe, which was leased for a term of 15 years, has now been acquired by Government. FINANCIAL. 10. The fees for the treatment, shoeing, etc., of animals amount to Rs. 11,127-5-9 against Rs. 8,890-12-4 in 1902-1903. They would have amounted to Rs. 11,233-7-9 had the fees for Government animals been charged; the cost of feeding the patients was Rs. 17,983-2-5 against Rs. 15,636-15-2 in 1902-1903. The increase, both in fees and cost of feeding, is due to a larger number of animals admitted. 11. The statement showing the provincial cost of the Department is appended. OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS. 12. Of the outstanding sum of Rs. 150-2-0 shown in last year's report Rs. 2-8 are still due from one person. The outstanding accounts for 1903-1904 amount to Rs. 25.6-0. All these are expected to be recovered shortly. THE HOSTEL. 13. All the students lived in the Hostel; their general health was good. INSTRUCTIONS TO OTHERS THAN VETERINARY STUDENTS. 14. The usual course of 48 lectures on "Veterinary Hygiene" and " Cattle breeding and rearing" was delivered to 21 Agricultural students during the vacation. All passed the examination which was held at the end of the course. 15. Twenty-eight Commissariat Transport drivers were instructed in nursing sick animals during the vacation. An examination was held after they were trained, and all but one passed. 16. General.APPENDICES.

AGRICULTURE. CALCUTTA, THE 8TH AUGUST, 1904. RESOLUTION( 2 ) 4. There was a slight increase in the total number of cases of cattle- disease reported from the districts during the year. There was a very marked increase in the number of animals attacked by foot-and-mouth disease, and a noticeable decrease in the number of those suffering from rinderpest. There were over 25,500 cases of the former disease as against 8,436 in the previous year; very severe outbreaks occurring in Backergunge and Palamau, from each of which districts over 9,000 cases were reported. The preventive measures taken in the former district were most effective; practically every animal affected received treatment; and it is satisfactory to observe that the percent- age of deaths was as low as .04. On the other hand the number of animals attacked by rinderpest (15,266) was the lowest on record during the last four years; and it is clear that there has been a steady and general decrease in the number of such cases since the year 1900-01 when they reached the large total of nearly 64,000. As in the previous year, this disease was specially prevalent in the districts of Khulna and Palamau, nearly 3,000 animals being attacked in the former and over 4,500 in the latter district. Altogether 9,454 cattle were immunised, but unfortunately these operations had to be suspended owing to a deficiency in the supply of serum and partly also in consequence of the small- ness of the staff available. This stoppage of the supply was the more regret- table, as it occurred at the beginning of the rinderpest season when, owing to the outbreaks which occurred in various places, the demand was at its greatest. 5.
