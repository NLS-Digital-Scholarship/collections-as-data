8 VACCINATION REPORT, Caste. 16. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 4,666 Christians, 690,801 Hindus, 133,631 Musalmáns, 2,141 Pársis, and 68,993 persons of other castes. Among Hindus and Musalmáns the numbers and percentages are higher than last year, whilst in the remaining castes they are lower. Age. 17. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz. : under 1 year, bet- ween 1 and 6 years, and above 6 years. The numbers under each period primarily vaccinated were respect- ively 627,179, 256,786 and 16,267 against 624,747, 256,506 and 15,141 during the preceding year. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 598,069, of children between 1 and 6 years 242,500, and of persons of other ages 13,613. Thus out of every 100 persons primarily vaccinated there were 69.67 infants, of whom 66.43 were successfully vaccinated. Compared with the preceding year this rate is lower by 0.06 per cent., the difference between the numbers vaccinated and the successful cases being only 0.03 per cent. more than last year. Sex. 18. There were 464,209 males and 436,023 females primarily vaccinated. The re-vaccinated were respectively 41,738 and 16,732 ; and the totals of persons operated on were 505,947 males and 452,755 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages are respectively 51.57 and 48.43 against 51.57 and 48.43 in the preceding year.' In re-vaccination they were respectively 71.38 and 28.62 against 68.39 and 31.61; and in total operations 52.77 and 47.23 against 52.53 and 47.47 in 1888-89. Percentages of success. 19. The following table shows by districts and circles the percentages of success in primary vaccination and re-vaccination contrasted with those for the previous year:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 9 Rate per mille of popula- tion protected by primary vaccinations. 20.

In all other establishments there was a decrease. In re-vacci- nation there is an increase in the work of Municipal, Local Fund, Native State and dispensary establishments, and decrease under Government, Cantonment, British and Native Armies. Taking the two kinds of operations together, there is a net increase of 7,608 or 0.80 per cent. Results in vaccine opera- tions by establishments. 23. The results in primary vaccination, re- vaccination and total operations, as analysed by esta- blishments, are as under :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 11 Work of Government Vac- cinators. 26. There are two Government vaccinators for the Cantonments of Rájkot and Deesa. The Rájkot vaccinator is wholly paid from Provincial Funds, a small addition being made to his pay from the Káthiáwár Agency Vaccination Funds. The pay of the Deesa vaccinator is made up by equal contributions from the Provincial and Cantonment Funds, plus a small contribution from the Pálanpur Superintendency Vaccination Fund. Besides these two, there are three others, under the Station Staff Surgeons, for the Military Stations of Mhow, Neemuch and Nasirabad, paid from &quot;Military Funds&quot;, and their work is included under the head of Native Army and Camp Followers. The Rájkot and Deesa vacci- nators work among a population of 126,049 souls in an area of 1,135 square miles. They returned 3,976 primary vaccinations and 249 re-vaccinations, of which 3,718 or 93.51 per cent. and 137 or 55.02 per cent. respectively were successful. Taking the two operations together, 30.59 per 1,000 of population were protected. The total cost was Rs. 520-15-0, equal to annas 2 and pies 2 for each successful case. The unsuccessful and unknown were respectively 167 and 100. In re-vaccinations the unsuccessful and unknown were 95 and 17. There were 9 secondary operations. Each vaccinator on an average operated on 2,112 persons. Work of Cantonment Vacci- nators. 27. There is only one vaccinator for the Cantonments of Poona and Kirkee, which cover an area of 4 square miles and a population of 38,024 (including 8,779 fighting men). His work is supervised by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District. Vaccination in the Devláli Cantonment is through- out the year now carried on by the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital without additional charges. Vaccination is also performed in the Málegaon Cantonment in the Násik Collectorate and Ahmedabad Cantonment in the Ahmedabad Collectorate. Taking the work in the five Cantonments together, there were 2,044 persons primarily vaccinated and 438 re-vaccinated. In primary vaccination 2,006 or 98.14 per cent. were successful, and in re-vaccination 279 or 63.69 per cent. were successful. The rate of protection per mille was 56.63. The total cost was Rs. 862-3-5 or annas 6 for each successful case. There were 13 unsuccessful and 25 unknown cases under primary vaccination, and 100 and 59 respectively in re-vaccination work. No persons were operated on more than once. Work of Municipal Vacci- nators. 28.

Amongst the European troops the number of persons primarily vaccinated was 192, and in 154 cases the operation was successful. The unsuccessful and unknown cases amounted to 38 and 21 respectively. There were 21 secondary operations. The re-vaccinations were 790, of which 471 were successful, whilst 331 were unsuccessful and 14 were unknown. In 126 cases re-vaccination was repeated. Native Army. In the Native Army the primarily vaccinated numbered 3,521 and the re-vaccinated 2,826 against 3,594 and 4,604 respective- ly in the preceding year. The number of persons primarily vaccinated successfully was 3,190 and in re-vaccination there were 2,009 successful cases. The unsuccessful and unknown cases numbered respectively 349 and 36 in primary vaccination and 839 and 53 in re-vaccination ; the secondary operations were 54 in number and in 75 cases re-vaccination was repeated. The work performed by vaccinators in the Military Stations of Mhow, Neemuch and Nasirabad is included, as usual, in that for camp followers.

Quality of lymph in use. The quality of lymph in use was reported generally to be good, but the results do not appear to be satisfactory, as there were 577 insertions of which the resulting vesicles were 125 (61 good, 28 large, 30 middling and 6 small) and the remaining 452 totally failed. Lymph supplied. 36. During the year lymph was supplied to the Medical Officer, Her Majesty's Indian Marine Steamer &quot; Dalhousie,&quot; Bom- bay Harbour; to the Staff Surgeon, Neemuch ; Station Hospital, Aden; to His Highness Mahárajá Scindia, Gwalior ; to the Deputy Sur- geon General, Central Provinces, Nágpur ; to the Civil Surgeon, Barabanki; to the Medical Officers, Bombay Rifles, Neemuch; 2nd Bombay Lancers, Bombay, Kashmir; 3rd Battalion Bombay Rifles, Indore, Mhow, and Deesa, by the Super- intendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. Lymph was also supplied to the Station Hospital, Belgaum, and to the Medical Officer, 30th Regiment, Native Infantry, from the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District: also to the Medical Officers in charge Regiments at Hingola, Aurangabad, Mominabad, Jalna, Bolaram and Raichur ; to the Civil Surgeons of Unao, Barabanki and Harda; to the Super- intendents of Vaccination at Lucknow and Lalitpur, and Superintendent of Pánchgani, by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District. A supply of lymph was sent to the Medical Officers in charge Her Majesty's 14th Regiment, Bombay Infantry, Bhúj; Bombay Rifles, Neemuch; Western Rájputána States, Jodhpur ; to the Medical Clerk, Ajmere; to the Assistant Surgeons, Sádra, by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Eastern Gujarát Regis- tration District. Animal vaccination. 37. Efforts are being made to introduce animal vaccination, as far as practicable, throughout the Presidency. Several vacci- nators and candidates of this department, as well as medical students, were trained under Dr. Kantak, the Superintendent of Vaccination, Bombay. Amongst those who received practical instruction in animal vaccination areBOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 17 In Poona City 81 heifers were successfully inoculated at a cost of Rs. 284-12-0 and in Poona Cantonment 61 heifers at a cost of Rs. 228-1-0. In Bombay City 676 heifers were inoculated of which 11 failed. The number of failures during the year was not so large as in the preceding year when it was 30, but the number of calves affected by foot and mouth disease was exception- ably large, viz. 96. Places where animal vac- cination was carried on. Vaccination with animal lymph was also carried on in Bándra and Kúrla in the Thána Collectorate, and in Hubli and Dhárwár in the Dhárwár Collectorate. Owing to the Muni- cipality of Belgaum refusing to sanction funds, animal vaccination in that town had to be discontinued at the end of the small-pox epidemic in 1889. Except in Bombay City, where animal lymph only is used, vaccination in all other places was carried on from arm to arm with human lymph. Expenditure. 38. The total expenditure on account of vac- cination is shown in the following table, compared with the preceding year :18 VACCINATION REPORT, The total cost for the year under report, excluding the pay of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Superintendents of Vaccination, was Rs. 2,37,128-14, which, when divided amongst 879,679 successful cases, amounts to annas 4 and pies 4, or pies 4 more than for the previous year. Work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Superin- tendents of Vaccination. 40. The inspectorial work performed by the supervising officers is shown in the following table:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 19 &quot;bad&quot;. These results show the degree of protection afforded. The greatest number of inspections was in the Central and Eastern Gujarát Registration Dis- tricts, whilst the least was in the Western Gujarát Circle. Inspections without vacci- nation registers. The number of children, whose arms were inspected without the register test, was 9,052, of whom 4,431 were in the Southern, 868 in the Western, 2,330 in the Central Registration Districts, 403 in Western Gujarát, and 1,020 in Sind. In Eastern Gujarát no inspections were held without the register test. Remarks on the work of Supervising officers. 42. All the supervising officers have worked with energy and zeal through- out the year, as may be seen by the above results of their labours. Work of Inspectors and Assistant Superintendents. 43.

Of this number, 27 Inspectors and 2 Assistant Superintendents were paid by Government and the remainder by Native States. The names of 374,816 child- ren were called from registers, of whom 274,720 were present and 99,476 absent, but their absence was accounted for, whilst 620 had migrated. Out of 274,720 children inspected 263,784 were protected and in 10,936 cases the operation was unsuccessful. Again out of 263,784 successful cases 181,008 had &quot; good&quot; cica- trices, 47,964 &quot; middling &quot; and 34,812 &quot; bad.&quot; In the registers tested the results were entered as 352,365 successful, 8,666 unsuccessful and doubtful, 14,313 unknown or absent, and 528 secondary operations. The greatest number of villages seen was in Sind. The largest number of children inspected was in the Central Registration District. Conduct of inspecting officers. 44. The conduct of the inspecting officers was reported to be satisfactory. Total inspections. 45. Taking the work of all Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Superintend- ents, Assistant Superintendents and Inspectors to- gether there were 4,771 encampments, 87,392 miles travelled in 8,637 days, and 311,558 children inspected in 13,231 villages. Out of every 100 persons operated on 32.75 were inspected this year against 33.58 in the preceding year. Conduct of vaccinators. 46. 8 vaccinators were dismissed, 15 were degraded and reduced, 5 were suspended and 135 were fined, for misconduct, to the aggregate amount of Rs. 179. With these exceptions the conduct of the vaccinators was generally good. Conduct of clerks and kárkúns. 47. Two kárkuns in the Presidency Circle were fined. All the rest worked to the entire satisfaction of their superiors. Inoculation. 48. Inoculation was not practised anywhere in the Presidency Proper; it was however reported to have been practised during- March in the Nagar Párkar Táluka in Sind.
20 VACCINATION REPORT, Ill effects by vaccination. 49. No instances were reported of any other disease but cow-pox having been communicated through vaccination. Abscesses and ulcers in the sites of vaccination vesicles were observed by Dr. Colah. Dr. Kantak says : &quot; It is well known that bovine lymph is more powerful and affects the system of tender children more strongly during the development of vesicles than does humanized lymph. The records have heretofore shown no cases of death resulting from an attack of small-pox after vaccination with bovine lymph. Cases have occurred in which probably owing to children having already, at the time of vaccination, been in the incubatory period, got small-pox subsequently ; then again rarely cases have occurred in which small-pox in a modified form has attacked persons vaccinated in infancy. A few cases are sometimes seen in which the vesicular development has run an irregular course attended with inflammatory symptoms, glandular swellings and slight skin eruption, &c.; and although the majority of these cases are due to the general filthy condition of their bodies and their surroundings, a few may be due to the occasional deterioration of the lymph, which it is impossible by mere inspection to detect. When vaccination has been performed with efficient calf lymph and under proper precautions the system receives an impress more powerful and more durable and far less mischievous, than when operated on with humanized lymph.&quot; A few cases of small-pox occurring after vaccination were seen by Dr. Street. Aid from Civil, Revenue and Political officers. 50. The Civil, Revenue and Political officers have rendered aid when required to all the officers of this department. Small-pox by Collectorates. 51. The table given below shows the deaths from small-pox for the year under report as well as the ages of the deceased and the number of persons successfully operated on in each district of the Bombay Presidency :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 21 52. Small-pox was prevalent more or less in every district of the Presidency during the year. The highest number of deaths was recorded in Sind. With re- gard to Bombay City, Dr. Kantak remarks that &quot; in July 1889 a representation was made soliciting the attention of Government to the general unprotected condition of Native Christians coming from Goa and the class of Hindus who constitute the majority of mill-hands in this city and who come from Ratnágiri and down the coast and certain suggestions were submitted. Government were pleased to address the Mill-owners' Association on the subject, and I was able to ascertain the general condition of the mill-hands. The inspection revealed, so far as it went, a practical or complete susceptibility to small-pox in the proportion of 16.54 per cent; in 23 of the mills no inspection took place on account of the perverse attitude of the operatives and the inability or refusal of the managers to assist; with the excep- tion of about 162 females, all the female hands and young operatives refused to be inspected; and there is reason to believe that if the inspection had included them, the proportion of unprotected persons would have been far higher. I subsequent- ly submitted all this in the form of a report. No orders have been issued thereon up to date, but it is hoped that some definite measures are in contemplation with respect to giving effect to my suggestions, for, doubtless, this condition of the above-mentioned classes is a standing menace to the general security of the community against small-pox. Nothing short of legislation can meet the case, and the present is the most appropriate time for it, for while the Factory Bill is under enactment, the opportunity can be taken of adding a section making it obligatory on the mill managers to insist on their employés showing proofs of having been efficiently protected agaist small-pox. Taking the figures of deaths from this cause for the last 40 years into consideration, it will be observed that although the position of the city as the largest centre of commerce in the East naturally renders it peculiarly liable to the importation of small-pox and other infectious diseases, the ravages of that disease have gradually become less severe. There is however the lurking fear that so long as the general unprotected condition of the Goanese and the mill operatives continues as at present, there is risk in every epidemic.&quot; Progress in the Western Registration District. 53.

The percentages were 95.98 under primary and 74.41 under re-vaccination against 96.30 and 72.91 last year. The rate of protection per mille of population was 30.77 ; last year it was 31.04. Each vaccinator vaccinated on an average 1,952 persons. The total cost was Rs. 12,821-2-4, or annas 3 and pie 1 per each successful case. Dispensary vaccination was discontinued in this state from the current year. Progress in the Cutch Circle. 91. The State of Cutch has a population of 512,084 persons and an area of 6,500 square miles. It is administered by a Superin- tendent of. Vaccination, who has under him an Assistant Superintendent, 17 vaccinators and 19 peons. Each vaccinator has an average population of 30,123 and an area of 382 square miles. The number of persons primarily vaccinated was 21,478 and re-vaccinated 258 against 21,125 and 304 respectively last year. The successful cases were 21,227 and 201 or 98.33 and 77.91 per cent. The rate of protection per mille of popu- lation was 41.84 ; last year it was 40.93. Each vaccinator operated on an average on 1,279 persons. The total expenditure was Rs. 7,143-10-9 and the average cost per each successful case was annas 5 and pies 4 ; in the preceding year it was annas 5 and pies 8. Progress in Aden. 92. Aden has an area of 11.6 square miles and a population of 34,860 persons. The Municipality defrays the cost of one male and one female vaccinator and one peon who work under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon. All cases of vaccination reported as successful are verified and payment is made to the vaccinators according to results and not in the form of a monthly salary as heretofore. This system, however, has not been very successful, as there were in the year under report only 913 persons primarily vaccinated against 983 in the preceding year. There were 10 re-vaccinations against 2 in 1888-89. Of the primary vaccinations 704 and of the re-vaccinations 4 were successful. The rate of protection afforded was 23.31 per 1,000 of population. The total cost was Rs. 531-6-0 and the average cost per each successful case was annas 12. In the dispensary of Shaikh Othman and in the hospital at Steamer Point 1,004 persons were primarily vaccinated and 2 re-vaccinated. 29630 VACCINATION REPORT, Progress in Khelat, Muskat and Bushire. 93. A vaccinator was deputed to work in Khelát. He primarily vaccinated36 and re-vaccinated 18 persons : all the operations were successful. There were 266 persons primarily vaccinated in Muskat, of which 254 or 95.49 per cent. were successful, there was no re-vaccination work. In the Residency dispen- sary, Bushire, there were 357 persons primarily vaccinated, of which 299 or 83.73 per cent. were successful. Tour of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Superin- tendents of Vaccination. 94. The places visited, the number of miles travelled, the number of childreninspected, the number of villages inspected and the number of days spent in travelling by each Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent of Vaccina- tion are given below.

He also passed through the Native States of Rámdurg, Kurundvád, Lakshmeshvar, Savanúr, Mudhol, Sángli and Jam- khandi. He inspected 7,425 children in 180 villages and the number of miles travelled was 3,312 in 177 days. (d). The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in the Eastern Gujarát Registration District went through the tálukas of Jalálpor, Bárdoli, Chorási and Mándvi of the Surat District; the tálukas of Mehmadabad, Daskrohi, Parántij and Modása of the Ahmedabad Collectorate. He also went through the whole of Mahi Kántha and a great portion of the Pálanpur Superintendence. He travelled over 1,343 miles in 119 days and inspected 6,389 children in 292 villages. (e). In the Western Gujarát Circle Dr. Quicke, the Acting Superintendent of Vaccination, travelled from 1st April to 5th May 1889 through Verával, Gondal and Rájkot and inspected the work of vaccinators there. He travelled took charge of this Circle on the 6th of May 1839 and travelled through Pálanpur Deesa, Dhanera, Tharád, Deodar and Thara. He travelled 337 miles, visited 79 villages and inspected 1,719 children in 33 days. (BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 31 Compulsory Vaccination. 95. The Compulsory Vaccination Act (No. I of 1877) has been in forcein Bombay city for 12 years and is worked fairly well in the absence of a proper work-shop and implements. The following table shows the progress in the protection of infants during the last 14 years, the first two being before, and the last 12 after, the introduction of the Act:32 VACCINATION REPORT, &quot;There is only one Inspector of Vaccination in the Dhárwár Collectorate and he is unable to efficiently supervise the work of his large establishment, viz., 19 local fund vaccinators, 2 candidate vaccinators and 3 municipal vaccinators, and with three animal vaccine stations it is impossible for him to supervise them also. It would be wrong I consider to further develop animal vaccination in this district until provision is made for proper supervision. The vaccinators are too inexperienced to carry on the work alone, and as there are only four in- spectors for the district, excluding Native States, I trust the question will receive the attention it requires. &quot; Vaccination laws are required in at least municipal towns. The Hubli Municipality applied for the necessary powers during the year, but were refused by Government. It is only right, however, to point out from a medical point of view the necessity for such laws. In Belgaum, where vaccination is permitted to be carried on without system or method, the troops in cantonments have been several times, during the last 10 years, menaced by the presence of small-pox in the Belgaum Bazar. Fortunately the well protected state of the garrison has saved them from attack. &quot; An animal vaccine depôt is urgently required in the Kánara Collectorate The quality of the present lymph stock in that district is worse than in any other. Under proper supervision it would be no difficult matter to form depôts at one or more of the populous coast townsBOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 33 class, one 2nd class, and two 3rd class. Vaccination in most cases requires to be inspected twice annually, and I trust steps will be taken to provide at least an additional 2nd class inspector for Dhárwár and Kánara. &quot;The Dhárwár District Board have sanctioned two new 2nd grade vaccinators and one candidate vaccinator and increased the pay of the present candidate vac- cinator to Rs. 10 per mensem and the number of vaccinators for the collectorate is now sufficient. &quot; The District Local Boards of Bijápur, Kánara and Belgaum were asked to bring up the vaccination establishment of their districts to a proper strength and the question is still under correspondence. &quot; The pay of municipal vaccinators when holding additional charge of táluka villages surrounding municipal towns should be never less than Rs. 24 per men- sem. The contribution from municipal and local funds should be arranged according to the work performed. &quot;Acting on the principles of the Local Government Board, England, in giving rewards to public vaccinators, I in 1884 recommended that similar rewards should be given in this Circle. In two collectorates they were sanctioned from local funds and yearly two prizes of Rs. 15 and Rs. 10 are given to the most deserving vaccinators in each collectorate. I generally take the recommendation of the inspectors in distributing the prizes and I consider there is no reason to suppose but that the best men get them. &quot; Re-vaccination work remains backward throughout the district. Although great efforts were made during the year and many letters were sent out from this office on the subject, only an increase of 13,765 operations were performed over last year. The people object to re-vaccination. I have tried to get the vaccinators to push forward the work in the schools but have not been very successful. It should be made a rule that all school children of 10 years of age should be re-vaccinated and that all school children bearing bad and imperfect marks of their primary vaccination should be re-vaccinated whenever the vaccinator attends the school. The vaccinator should be obliged to attend all the schools within his charge at least once annually. At present one of the chief reasons why re-vaccination is not performed in the schools is the fear of the school-master that the parents will forbid their children attending the school if re-vaccination is attempted. Frequently also there is friction between the school-master and vaccinator who each considers himself superior in position to the other. &quot; Vaccination is carried out in 7 towns of Native States by the dispensary medical officers. The amount of work was insufficient and re-vaccination work practically neglected. Efforts will be made to improve the work, but it would be better if professional vaccinators were appointed and the medical officers relieved. In the large town of Sháhápur this procedure was suggested, but the Sángli State were unwilling to change. Practically much of the work is left to the compounders. &quot; The districts in charge of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner are too large and cannot be properly supervised. The Kolhápur Native State and the large number of States comprised under the Southern Marátha States, together with the independent States of Jath, Daphlápur and Savanúr, should be placed under a separate Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The officer might be appointed from the Bombay Medical Establishment or obtained direct from England; if the latter, he should possess a certificate or diploma in Public Health. In addition to the vaccination of these States the inspection of the dispensaries and sanitation should be placed under his charge. &quot; All the vaccinators have been supplied with maps of their tálukas with the exception of the Sirsi and Mundgod vaccinators of Kánara. The maps of these tálukas have not been as yet published, but as the survey has been completed, they will shortly be supplied. &quot; In the monthly vaccination returns the number of insertions and resulting vesicles are given by the vaccinators, but in their annual reports no percentage of the results is given. The &quot; percentage insertion success rate &quot; should, I consider, be furnished annually by each vaccinator. Similarly for annual vaccination B 29634 VACCINATION REPORT. where carried out. In the reports on the operations of the animal vaccine stations at Lamb's Conduit Street, London, the insertion success rate by each medical officer is always reported. &quot; The percentage of success in vaccination was for the whole district 94.06 ; but as this shows nothing regarding the degree of success, the statement is somewhat misleading, and it appears to me the percentage insertion success rate would be of more value. The percentage success was good in all establishments except dispensaries. Excluding Mudhol and Indi, where very little work was performed, the percentage success was in Sángli 88.52, Sháhápur 75.09, Shirhatti 84.76, Mangalvedha 87.50, Kavatha 89.86. Only in one dispensary, Terdal, was the percentage success goodBOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 35 in connection with calf inoculation had been introduced by me long before the appearance of the pamphlet. The introduction of steel handled scalpels here is, however, due to Surgeon-Major Barclay's book; they are handy and cap- able of being kept thoroughly clean; and I hope they will before long be in general use, replacing the present wood-handled scalpels. The use of scrap- ings of the solid parts of the vesicles in the preparation of preserved lymph adopted in Germany and recommended by Surgeon-Major Barclay on econo- mical grounds is, I think, unsuitable and ill-adapted to the conditions of this country, not only on account of the rapidity with which decomposition sets in here in organic tissues, but also on account of the prejudices it will create against animal vaccination. Further, the inoculated calves being returned to the con- tractor in this country, and not slaughtered as in Germany, the opportunity for ascertaining the condition of their health is totally wanting here. The proper preservation of lymph and its successful use in the field of operation is destined, however, to mark an important epoch in the annals of vaccination in this country, for when it becomes an accomplished fact, the chief objection to the spread of animal vaccination here will have been overcome ; for looking at the figures given in the above pamphlet it must be conceded that, despite the un- suitability of some of the German processes to this country, the expenditure on animal vaccination, as at present carried on here, can be so materially reduced as to make it acceptable to mofussil Municipalities and Local Boards.&quot; *In G. R. in the General Department, No. 3133, dated 6th August 1889. 100. The. following remarks are meant as a warning against discontinuing the practice of arm-to-arm vaccination, especially in the outlying villages of districts in this country. In his report, circulated for guidance and information*by the Government of India, Dr. Barclay describes the system of carrying out animal vaccination prac- tised in London, Brussels and Germany, but which from his account is a system in which both humanized and animal vaccine lymph are conjointly used. That &quot; animal vaccination&quot; does not exclude the use of human lymph is clear from more than one remark throughout the report, e.g. &quot; with regard to the lymph to be inserted (in the calf) it is no doubt best to use human lymph, for experience in Germany has shown that calf-lymph after the second to the fourth generation certainly degenerates.&quot; Again, at page 10 : &quot;I will explain the most important rules in force in Germany with regard to the collection of human lymph, as a supply of this is essentially necessary for the proper cultiva- tion of animal lymph.&quot; Read in the light of these statements, the directions given in the second paragraph of the letter from the Secretary to the Government of India are not altogether clear. The Sanitary Commissioner is urged to arrange for the provision with &quot; as little delay as possible of such a supply of animal lymph as will enable pro- vincial vaccine establishments to dispense with lymph obtained from the human subject.&quot; Yet it is laid down in the report furnished for guidance that a supply of human lymph is &quot; essentially necessary &quot; for the proper cultivation of animal lymph. It is probably intended that human lymph shall be used for the inoculation of calves and not for the vaccination of human beings. Even in this restricted sense, it will be necessary to obtain lymph from a considerable number of human beings for the purpose of keeping up animal vaccination. 101. It may here be remarked that the process of passing human lymph through an animal is not strictly speaking &quot; animal vaccination &quot; but retro- vaccination. This has been repeatedly practised, and the process is simple, but the results possess no recognizable superiority or advantage whatever over ordinary humanized vaccine lymph. There is no novelty in the system, and it lacks the simplicity of the arm-to-arm system in force in Great Britain and India. By carrying out animal vaccination at the head-quarters of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the larger municipal towns, the wishes of the Government of India, as expressed in paragraph 2 of their letter, could to a certain extent be given effect to. Dispensing with human lymph would involve an expenditure out of all proportion to the benefit, if any, that would result from the complete substitu-
36 VACCINATION REPORT. tion of animal for human lymph. In Bombay city, where only animal lymph is used, the cost of each successful case was Rs. 1-1-10. If animal vaccina- tion be carried out in the districts with a widely dispersed population often of difficult access owing to creeks, hills and rivers, the cost per case would be even greater than in the city of Bombay, where the population is concentrated. Taking the cost in Bombay as applicable to the Presidency and Sind, the annual expenditure consequent on the adoption of this system would at least amount to three times the present cost. 102. Supposing that the money were available, the question should first be considered whether the introduction of the method adopted on the Con- tinent of Europe and recommended to be followed in India would be unattended by risk to the growing appreciation by the people of the benefits of vaccination as now practised. The existing arm-to-arm system, which is identical with that practised in England and Scotland, has resulted in the protection against small- pox of a number of persons almost equal to the number of children annually born excluding those dying within the first year of life and those unfitted from sickness or other cause for vaccination. It is surely not asking too much that a system, which has attained such popularity and accomplished such results at a cost of about a third of that likely to be incurred by the introduction of the new system, should not be set aside until the latter has been clearly demonstrated to be superior in principle and practice and equally acceptable to the people. 103. Dr. Barclay continues: &quot; On the following day, the animal affording the lymph on the previous day is again tied to the table, and the whole of the lymph removed. The animal is then killed and examined post mortem as to its sound- ness, and, if sound, the lymph is used and the flesh sold in the public market as quite wholesome.'' Comment on such proceedings amongst a community com- posed mainly of Hindus is unnecessary. The report proceeds: &quot; The thick scrapings and the exuding lymph are all placed together in a stone mortar and well rubbed with the gradual addition later of little powdered sugar of milk and lastly a third or a half of the volume of the mass in the mortar of pure glycerine is gradually added under constant rubbing converting the whole into a thin pultaceous or syrupy fluid. This syrupy mass is then passed through a fine metallic sieve by pressure with bone spatulas in order to remove any shreds of tissue which may not have been broken up during triturition.&quot; After reading this description of the &quot; thin pultaceous fluid &quot; to be employed in vaccination, it is not difficult to understand that in London &quot;the prejudice of the people forbids the admixture of any foreign substance with the lymph.&quot; Those who know the people of India are not likely to believe that their pre- judices against such admixture will be less than those of the people of London. Continuing, Dr. Barclay says: &quot; If the thin pultaceous or syrupy fluid &quot; is then put into small glass tubes of various sizes but mostly 2 to 3 C.M. long and 3 to 8 M. M. in diameter, i.e. ¾ to 1¼ inches long and 1/10 to 3/10 inches in diameter, which are corked with fresh corks and having been inverted the corked ends are dipped into melted paraffin to secure efficient closure. Both tubes and plagues of glass are then wrapped in tin foil to protect the lymph material from light and stored in an ice-box on trays over the ice until required for transmission by post to the vaccinators.&quot; 104. Probably some difficulty would be found in carrying out with preci- sion the delicate and complicated process described. It is at all events certain that the manipulations could not be entrusted to the present members of the vaccine establishment who are almost altogether devoid of scientific knowledge and training. The procedure may be simple enough in a country like Germany, where the requisite agencies for carrying it out are available in abundance ; but in this country it would be very much otherwise and disaster might not infrequently be the result. Even after the despatch of the fluid by post the risks to which it would be subjected by delay and exposure would only be commencing. 105. Doctor Barclay allows that &quot; when pure lymph is used, a large absorb- ng area is unnecessary either in the vaccination of human beings or animals,
BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 37 but when diluted lymph is used this is necessary in both cases.&quot; In other words, the system, which it is proposed to introduce necessitates a more extensive scari- fication of the skin of those operated upon than at present. Most of those who have operated on native children will be inclined to believe that this necessity for a more severe operation will not help to recommend the new procedure to the people. 106. But even if the operation on human beings is necessarily more severe as a consequence of diluted and not pure lymph being used, that on the calves approaches the verge of cruelty. &quot; Calves in all provinces have always been hired, and it would have to be ascertained whether they are as readily to be bought; for if the economical system of vaccinating these animals by scarification be resorted to, it would be necessary to kill the calf after the lymph has been gathered, not only because it is desirable to ascertain by post mortem examina- tion that the animal was perfectly healthy, but also because a very extensive wound is made from which the animal would recover with difficulty and after a painful time.&quot; It would not be easy to suggest a procedure better calculated to set the people of this country against vaccination than the one described. Further inquiry is necessary before Government is finally committed to a scheme, which most men practically acquainted with vaccination in this country cannot but regard with misgivings. C. W.

The Government of India, in Resolution, Home Department (Public), No. 28-1579-95, dated 15th July 1887, embodied in Bombay Government Resolution, General Department, No. 2426, dated 17th August 1887, para. 5, ruled that the report on vaccination should be submitted in full every third year, statistical returns and brief com- mentaries or notes being submitted in the intermediate years. In accordance with these instructions the report on vaccination for the year 1889-90 was submitted in full, whilst the one for this year consists of short notes and the usual state- ments. Strength of the Department. 2. The total strength of the Vaccination Depart- ment during the year 1890-91 was as follows:2 VACCINATION REPORT. It will be seen from the foregoing table that there were 885,260 persons primarily vaccinated and 46,487 revaccinated, against 900,232 and 58,470 re- spectively last year, showing a net decrease of 14,972, or 1.66 per cent., in primary vaccination and 11,983, or 20.49 per cent., in revaccination. The only increase recorded was 38 under primary vaccination in the British Army and 236 under revaccination in dispensaries during the year. On the whole there was in total operations a decrease of 26,955, or 2.81 per cent., over the preceding year for the entire Presidency. The causes of decrease are given below:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 3 Rate per mille of population on total successful primary vaccination as compared with infants under 1 year. 8. The following table gives the rate of primary successful vaccinationof children under 1 year and total successful primary operations per mille of population of each Collectorate and Native State as preferred by Government: vide para. 4 of their Resolution in the General Department, No. 4748, dated 4th December 1890. In my opinion, however, it would be more accurate to compare infantile vaccinations with thebirths than with the population of all ages :4 VACCINATION REPORT. against 15,241. In 31,132 cases the result was unknown, as the children were not again brought for inspection. 2,069 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. Results of revaccination. 11. During the year, 46,487 persons were revaccinated against 58,470 for1889-90. In 37 instances the revaccination was repeated, in 8,655 instances the result could not be ascertained, and in 9,410 the operation failed. The number of successful cases was 28,459, or 61.22 per cent., against 62.16 last year. Result of total operations. 12. The total number of persons operated on was 931,747, and of these870,372, or 93.41 per cent., were successful against 890,528, or 92.89 per cent., in the preceding year. The successful number consists of (861,053) civil population, (4,730) dispensary, (415) British Army, and (4,174) Native Army. 2,106 persons were operated on more than once, the &quot; unsucessful &quot; numbered 23,694 and the &quot; unknown &quot; cases were 39,787. The details of the total number of persons operated on for the last two years by districts and circles of vaccination, together with the percentages of increase and decrease, are shown in the following table :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 5 It is satisfactory to notice that in successful primary vaccination the per- centages, though somewhat lower in 6 out of 12 circles than last year, show on the whole an increase of 0.22 over that of last year. Agencies. 14. According to the different Agencies or Establishments, there was a slightincrease in primary work under Government, Municipal, and British Army. In the other establishments there was a decrease. In revaccination the only increase was under dispensaries, being 616 against 380, but in other establishments there was a decrease, and a consi- derable amount under Municipal, as there were only 5,439 persons revaccinated against 10,755 in 1889-90. Sex. 15. There were 454,681 males and 430,579 females primarily vaccinated,and 33,636 males and 12,851 females revaccinated; the totals of persons operated on were 488,317 males and 443,430 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages were respectively 51.36 males and 48.64 females against 51.57 and 48.43 in the preceding year. In revaccination the percentages were respectively 72.36 and 27.64 against 71.38 and 28.62 ; and in total operations 52.41 and 47.59 against 52.77 and 47.23 in 1889-90. Caste or race. 16. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 4,616 Christians,676,870 Hindus, 134,111 Musalmáns, 2,365 Pársis and 67,298 persons of other castes. In the previous year these numbers were respectively 4,666, 690,801, 133,631, 2,141 and 68,993. Age. 17. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under 1 year, be- tween 1 and 6 years and above 6 years. The numbers under each period primarily vaccinated were respec- tively 651,423, 219,038 and 14,799 against 627,179, 256,786 and 16,267during the preceding year. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 622,448, of children between 1 and 6 years 206,756, and of persons of other ages 12,709. Lymph. 18. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good, but in theforest districts of Kánara it was unsatisfactory, and animal vaccine depôts are urgently needed. Two con- signments of English lymph, of 65 tubes each, were received during the year, besides four of 6 tubes each for Aden. Animal lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle. Animal vaccination. 19. Animal vaccination was carried on in Bombay and Poona (city and cantonment) throughout the year. In the Western Registration District it was carried out temporarily in the towns of Kurla and Bándra in the Thána Zilla. In the town of Sholápur, in the Central Registration District, animal vaccination has been established since January 1891. The Ahmednagar Muni- cipality has provided funds for the purchase of calves for vaccination, and it is hoped that the lymph will soon be established there. Other small municipalities, such as Talegaon Dábháde, Álandi, &c., have voted sums necessary to provide calves for vaccination purposes. In the Southern Registration District, animal vaccination was kept up in Dhárwár and Hubli. The Municipality of Gadag-Bettigeri have sanctioned Rs.200 for this purpose, and a qualified vaccinator will be appointed in due course. The Belgaum Municipality were again urged to introduce animal vaccination and have sanctioned it during the current year. In the Sind Registration District, animal vaccination was again introduced into the city of Karáchi, and in October last an inoculated calf was sent from Bombay. The Hindu residents there, however, presented a petition to the Commissioner against its introduction, but no active opposition has been shown. Great difficulty, however, has been experienced there in procuring young calves for inoculation, and the contractor who has been supplying them hitherto has refused to renew his contract, and no one else can be found to take his place. B 3496 VACCINATION REPORT. The Chief Medical Officer of the Baroda State says, &quot; that animal vaccina- tion has been introduced in the city of Baroda since the 11th of January last, and up to the end of March 1891 twelve heifers were successfully inoculated and bovine lymph was distributed among a few vaccinators.&quot; The people greatly appreciate animal vaccination, as it does away with the necessity of their having to allow lymph to be taken from their children, to which they always object. Practical instruction in vaccination. 20. In connection with this subject,I may mention that a regular trainingclass for the instruction of the subordinates of the Sanitary Department in vaccination was established during the year. With the sanction of Government, the class was opened on 1st August 1890 under the Superintendent, Assistant Surgeon Kantak, and the course, which included practical instruction in human and animal vaccination, was finished on 30th September 1890. During the year under report, instruction was given to 47 members of this Department. Of these 8 were inspectors, 24 vaccinators and 15 candidates. Besides these 2 medical graduates, sent by the Agent to the Governor-General, Baroda, and a licentiate of medicine and surgery were given practical instruction in vaccination. Expenditure. 21. The total expenditure on account of vaccina- tion as compared with the preceding year is shown in the following statement:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 7 Villages visited and not visited by vaccinators. 24. In compliance with paragraph 5 of Government Resolution in theGeneral Department No. 4748, dated 4th December 1890, the following statement is appended, which shows the number of villages visited, as well as those left unvisited, by the vaccinators of the Department, in each district and NativeState:8 VACCINATION REPORT. them were the sickness of vaccinators, large number of villages under each vaccinator, and the interference of Census work. Inoculation. 26. Inoculation was not reported to have been practised anywhere in thePresidency, and no instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccina- tion. Conclusion. 27. Considering the numerous difficulties, physical and moral, that have tobe surmounted by the supervising and inspecting staff, the quantity of work, in my opinion, is satisfactory, andI am confident that the quality would compare favourably with vaccination inEngland. C. W. MACRURY, Surgeon-Major, Sanitary Commissioner. Bombay, 29th June 1891.

No. 2G68. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 28th July 1891. Letter from the Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay, No. 1684-B., dated 1st July 1891 2 true that the work done by the six Native State Dispensaries was much less than in the previous year, but the total operations in both years were small, and it is to the diminished outturn by Local Fund Vaccinators that the net decrease must be ascribed. The average number of persons vaccinated by each operator was 1,766 against 1,857 in 1889-90. 3. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations was 95.10, and of revaccinations 61.22. Under the former head there were no very marked variations from the figures of 1889-90, but under the latter, the percentage in the Presidency Circle rose from 18.09 to 38.08, and no reason has been assigned for the constant fluctuations in this Circle or for the variation of 20 per cent. in two years. In the Baroda Circle there was a marked decrease in the percentage of success under this head. The table given in paragraph 8 of the report shows that in several districts, very little progress is being made. In Kánara the results are especially bad, and even after allow- ing for the natural difficulties to be overcome, a rate of 8.1 per mille of children under one year of age, and of 25.5 per mille of all ages, must be regarded as showing a lack of energy on the part of the staff. Some explanation should have been given of the want of proportion between these two rates, as compared with the rates in other districts. 4. The Sanitary Commissioner remarks that the quantity of work done by the supervising and inspecting officers was sufficient, but the details before Gov- ernment are not such as to enable them to form an opinion, as the report does not contain an account of the work done by each officer and does not show what districts have been visited by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. In review- ing the report for 1889-90, Government had to remark that several districts in which vaccination was in a backward state, had not been visited, and it is necessary that the report should give a succinct account of the tour of each officer.

This report, as stated in paragraph 1 of last year's report, consists of short notes, and the usual statements with such additions as are required by Government, and the Sanitary Commis- sioner with the Government of India. Territorial changes. 2. By Government Resolution, in the General Department, No. 1170 of 1st April 1891, the appointment of Superintendent of Vaccination, Western Gujarát Circle, was abolished, and the office transferred to the Agency Surgeon, Rájkot; and as the annual report and statements for the year have not been received before this was sent to the press all information regarding this Circle is omitted. This Department is not responsible for the quality of the work performed in this Circle any more than in the Baroda State. Modnimb, a portion of the Miraj Senior State, which has hitherto been included in the Central Registration District, was transferred to the Southern Registration District during the year. By Government Resolution, in the General Department, No. 1824 of 25th May 1891, the name of the &quot; Eastern Gujarat Registration District &quot; was changed into &quot; Gujarat Registration District.&quot; Strength of the Department. 3. The total strength of the Vaccination De- partment during the year 1891-92 was as follows :2 decrease recorded was 600 under primary vaccination in the Baroda State, and 276 and 117 under re-vaccination in the Baroda and Cutch States respectively. The abstract of the table will show that in Dispensary vaccination work, there is a decrease under both kinds of vaccination. On the whole there was, in total operations, an increase of 63,079 or 7.09 per cent. over the preceding year. Results in primary vacci- nation. 5. Out of 830,873 persons primarily vaccinated 788,351 cases or 94.88 per cent. were successful. The number of unsuccess- ful cases was 13,091. In 31,544 cases, the result was unknown, as the children were not again brought for inspection. 2,113 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. 6. During the year 62,274 persons were re-vaccinated. In 56 instances the re-vaccination was repeated, in 11,886 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 11,896 the operation failed. The number of successful cases was 38,548 or 61.90 per cent. Results of re-vaccination. Infants successfully vacci- nated as compared with avail- able number. 7. The following table shows the number of infants successfully vaccinated in the Presidency exclusive of Native States. The birth and death statistics are taken for the calendar year, as usual, in calculating the number available for vaccination, because infants are generally not vaccinated until three months after birth:3 Districts.

The following table shows, by districts and circles, the percentages of success in primary and re-vaccination, contrasted with those for the previous year :4 from the calculation.&quot; In this way the percentage of success in primary vacci- nation in the Presidency Circle was 99.41 during the year 1891-92. In the same way if the &quot;unknown&quot; cases under re-vaccination be excluded, the percent- age of success would come to 93.54 in Bombay City. Insertion success rate. 11. The percentage of insertional success would, it appears, be of consi- derable value. But this information is not shown in any of the annual returns. Dr. Channer and Dr. Kantak have, however, attempted to show it for the first time this year. The insertion success rate, in the four towns of the Southern Registration District, where animal vaccination was carried out during the year, was 96.50 in Dhárwár, 90.46 in Gadag-Betigeri 85.40 in Belgaum and 79.01 in Hubli. The rate in the Presidency Circle was not very encouraging, being only 74.6 per cent. But this is the first attempt of the kind; better results are expected next year. As regards the inoculation of calves in Bombay, 80,959 insertions were made during the year, of which 78,777 were successful, the percentage of insertional success being 97.3. Remarks on Municipal Vac- cination Report, Bombay, for the year 1889-90 by the Army Sanitary Commission. 12. In reviewing the Administration Report of the Municipal Commis- sioner for the City of Bombay for the year 1889-90, the Army Sanitary Commission, in paragraph 21 of their memorandum, remarked that &quot; of 20,337 persons primarily vaccinated in Bombay 15,355 were under one year of age, and of these only 4,852 were suc- cessful. * * * &quot;I may here point out that the primary successful cases under one year of age, according to the Municipal Commissioner's Report, were 14,852 and not 4,852 as shown by the Army Sanitary Commission., vide page 327 of the Bombay Municipal Commissioner's Report for 1889-90. Agencies. 13. According to the different agencies or establishments, there was an increase in primary work under Local Fund, Muni- cipal, Cantonment, British and Native Armies. In the other establishments, there was a decrease. In re-vaccination there was an increase in all establishments. Sex. 14. There were 426,608 males and 404,265 females primarily vaccinated, and 46,552 males and 15,722 females re-vaccinated ; the totals of persons operated on were 473,160 males and 419,987 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages were respectively 51.34 males and 48.66 females. In re-vaccination the percentages were respect- ively 74.75 and 25.25, and in total operations 52.98 and 47.02. Caste or race. 15. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 5,047 Christians, 633,361 Hindus, 128,255 Mussalmáns, 2,227 Pársis, and 61,983 persons of other castes. Age. 16. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under 1 year, between 1 and 6 years, and above 6 years. The numbers under each period primarily vaccinated were 632,629, 182,482 and 15,762. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 603,022; of children between 1 and 6 years 171,627 ; and of persons of other ages 13,702. Lymph. 17. The quality of the lymph in use throughout the year was good. Two consignments of English lymph of 65 tubes (45 humanized and 20 calf) each, were received during the year; besides 4 of 6 tubes each for Aden ; lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle. The results of the English lymph were not satisfactory. The fresh supply was tolerably successful, but the second nearly all failed. Preservation of animal lymph. 18. In compliance with Government, Resolution in the General Depart- ment, No. 4804 of 8th December 1890, several expe- riments were made with a view to test the value of Surgeon-Major W. G. King's system of preserving animal lymph, the results of which did not justify me in recommending the general use of lymph preserved in lanoline. I have already expressed my
5 opinion to Government in my No. 2372 B of 16th September 1891, that in preparing the material to be of uniform strength, great care is necessary, and it must be rubbed into scarifications larger and deeper than when pure fresh lymph is used. Ignorant persons might mistake lanoline for other animal fats, against which they are prejudiced on religions grounds; and this might prove detrimental to the cause of vaccination. The success attending its use is not equal to that of fresh lymph. So long, therefore, as fresh animal or human lymph is available, there is no necessity or advantage in using it in a diluted state, no matter with what material it may be mixed as a vehicle. The mix- ture must be inferior and less active than pure fresh lymph from a calf or child's arm. It may, however, prove useful for re-vaccination of grown up people who can bear more extensive scarification and manipulation, better than children, when a supply of fresh lymph is not procurable. Animal vaccination. 19. Animal vaccination was carried on in the following places of the Bombay Presidency during the year under report: In the Western Registration District, animal lymph was used in the Muni- cipalities of Bándra, Kurla and Igatpuri. Lanoline vaccine paste was used in some cases, and the results at first appeared good, but as the paste lost its power, it was discontinued. In the City of Bombay, vaccination with animal lymph exclusively was carried on throughout the year. In the Central Registration District, the progress, on the whole, was satis- factory during the year. The Municipality of Ahmednagar having voted the necessary funds, the practice was successfully established in the month of July 1891, and has been since continued there. In the Municipalities of Poona, Sholápur, and in the Cantonment of Poona, it was carried on continuously throughout the year. It was also used in three small Municipalities, and 42 villages, all in the Poona Collectorate. The people of these 42 villages provide either a calf or a sum of money necessary to provide one and they much appre- ciate animal lymph as it does away with the necessity of lymph being taken from their children's arms. In the Southern Registration District, animal vaccination was continued throughout the year in Dhárwár and Hubli. In Gadag-Bettigeri, it was in- troduced on 31st July 1891, but stopped on 9th January 1892 owing to difficul- ties in procuring calves. In the town of Belgaum it was introduced on 22nd June 1891 and continued for the remainder of the year. In the Sind Registration District, animal vaccination was carried on in the City of Karáchi, but there is great difficulty in procuring calves. Practical instruction in vaccination. 20. Like the Presidency Circle, a regular training class for the instruction of the subordinates has been opened at Belgaum by Dr. Channer. During the months of July to October 1891 lectures and practical demonstrations in animal vaccination were given by him to the Inspectors and Vaccinators. Expenditure. 21. The total expenditure on account of vaccina- tion as compared with the preceding year is shown in the following statement:6 The total cost for the Presidency, including all charges, was Rs. 2,85,189-13-0 against Rs. 2,73,097-2-10 in the preceding year, whilst the successful cases, ex- cluding dispensaries and the army, were 817,120, the average cost for each suc- cessful case being annas 5 and pies 7 against annas 5 and pies 9 or 2 pies less than last year.

VACCINATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1892-93. Vaccination Report. The Government of India in Resolution, Home Department (Public), No. 282 VACCINATION REPORT, Increase or decrease in strength. 5. During the year, three Superintendents and three Assistant Superin- tendents were entertained in the Káthiáwár States. One additional Inspector was also entertained for the Mahi Kántha Agency in the Gujarát Registration District. There was one vaccination kárkún employed by the Karáchi Municipality at the close of the year; last year there were three such kárkúns employed tem- porarily who were then discharged. The addition of three clerks was made in the Káthiáwár States. There is a decrease of two vaccinators under municipal estab- lishment as two places in the Kolába Collectorate were abolished during the year. Under Local Fund establishment there is an increase of four vaccinators, one for each of the Collectorates of Thána, Kolába and Belgaum, and one for the Mevás villages in Khándesh. Five additional candidate vaccinators, one for Thána, one for Khándesh and three for Káthiáwár Native States, were enter- tained during the year. Under Native State establishment there is an addition of 11 vaccinators in the Káthiáwár States. One vaccinator formerly included in the Native States of the Western Registration District is now shown as a Local Fund vaccinator. In peons there was an increase of 26, of which 8 were entertained in the British Districts and 18 in the Native States (Káthiáwár). Thus, in the entire establishment, there has been an increase of three Superin- tendents, one Inspector, three Assistant Superintendents, one clerk, 17 vacci- nators and 26 peons.

The next table shows the number of persons primarily vaccinated as also the increase or decrease for each of the last ten years, together with the success among them :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 3 Years ending 31st March 1884. 1885. 1886. 1887. 1888. 1889. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893.

The total number of persons operated on was 986,758, and of these 910,689 or 92.29 per cent. were successful. In 1891-92 the respective figures were 998,065 and 927,296 or 92.91 per cent. The details of the total number of persons operated on for the last two years by Districts and Circles of vac- cination, together with increase or decrease, are shown in the following table, which contrasts the work amongst the civil and military population during the year under report with that for 1891-92 :4 VACCINATION REPORT, Causes of decrease. 14. The decrease is seen in the Sind, Southern and Gujarat Registration Circles and is due to the fever, cholera and partial scarcity which occurred in 1892. The decrease in primary operations in the Presidency Circle is owing to the presence of foot- and mouth disease amongst the calves which almost put a stop to the work. As regards the decrease shown in re-vaccinations in the same circle, this is due to fewer calls being made upon the Department to operate on pilgrims arriving in ships with small-pox on board. No reasons are given for the decrease of work in the Pálanpur and Cutch Circles. Infants successfully vac- cinated as compared with available numberSTATEMENT.

8 VACCINATION REPORT, Caste or race. 17. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 5,827 Christians, 715,775 Hindus, 130,482 Musalmáns, 2,193 Pársis and 69,888 persons of other castes. Hindus, Musalmáns and Pársis were less in number, but Christians, Hindus, and other castes were higher in percentages this year than in the preceding year. The Superin- tendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, observes that &quot; it is a curious fact as throwing a side light on the gradual enlightenment of the community, that among the higher classes generally very few children remain unprotected, but in the case of the depressed classes great vigilance has to be exercised to make them bring their children for vaccination; for, with these classes avoidance of vaccination is the rule, and not the exception as is the case with the higher classes.&quot; Age. 18. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under 1 year, between 1 and 6 years and above 6 years. The num- bers under each period primarily vaccinated were respectively 693,612, 213,607 and 16,946 against 708,279, 210,167 and 16,653 during the previous year. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 659,591 ; of children between 1 and 6 years 200,223; and of persons of other ages 14,105, Thus out of every 100 persons primarily vaccinated, there were 75.05 infants, of whom 71.37 were successfully vaccinated. Compared with the preceding year this rate is lower by 0.90 per cent., the difference between the numbers vaccinated and the successful cases being 0.21 per cent. more than last year. Sex. 19. There were 474,686 males and 449,479 females primarily vaccinated; the re-vaccinated were respectively 46,236 and 16,357, and the totals of persons operated on were 520,922 males and 465,836 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages are respectively 51.36 and 48.64 against 51.26 and 48.74 in the previous year. In re-vaccination they were respectively 73.87 and 26.13 against 74.74 and 25.26, and in total operations 52.79 and 47.21 against 52.74 and 47.26 last year. Percentage of success. 20. The following table shows by Districts and Circles the percentages of success in primary vaccination and re-:vaccination, contrasted with those for the previous year:BOMBAY FRESIDENCY. 9 Rate per mille of popula- tion on successful vaccination. 22. The following table gives the rate of primary successful vaccination of children under one year, and total successful primary operations per mille of population of each Collectorate and Native State, as desired by Government, vide paragraph 4 of their Resolution in the General Department, No. 4748 of 4th December 1890:10 VACCINATION REPORT, It will be observed from the foregoing table that at the rate of 31 per 1,000 on the total population of 29,374,621, there were 910,613 infants available for vaccination, of which 659,491 were successfully vaccinated. Thus out of every 100 infants available, 72.43 were protected, and 27.57 passed that age without being protected. Vaccination by establish- ments. 24. The progress of vaccination by different establishments will be seen from the following table:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 11 in the Native Army. In re-vaccination the highest percentage was 65.55 in Native States, and the lowest 50.48 under municipal establishments. In all establishments, as a whole, the percentage was 94.56 in primary and 58.74 under re-vaccination. Work of establishments.

Lymph was supplied by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, to the Chief Civil Administrative Medical Officer for Central India at Indore. It was also supplied by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Regis- tration District, to Medical Officers in charge Regiments, 4th Infantry, Horse Cavalry, Ráichur, Poona Horse, Sirur, 3rd Regiment, Bombay Light Infantry, Sátára; Medical Officer, Bolarum; Civil Surgeons, Mandala, Faizabad, Unao, Sultánpur, Gonda, Partábgar, Hardoi, Barabanki and Baraich; Superintendent of Vaccination, Lucknow, and Allahabad, and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Circle III, North-West Provinces, Almora. In the Presidency Circle, there were 1,004 applications for bovine lymph during the year. The number of tubes issued was 2,553. Of these tubes 1,648 were supplied locally to private parties, 393 to private persons in the mofussil, and 512 were supplied free of charge to the Civil and Residency Surgeons, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, and to Medical Officers in charge of Army Hospitals, up-country. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, sent one supply of lymph to the Superintendent of Vaccination, Nasirabad. Lymph children were supplied to the Assistant Surgeons in charge Bulsár and Sádra Dispensaries. Quality of Lymph in use. 38. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was reported to be good. Animal vaccination. 39. Animal vaccination is being gradually extended, and it is satisfactory to note that this mode of vaccinating is appreciated, the parents, as soon as it is known lymph will not be taken from their infants' arms, not objecting. There is more expense, of course, with this method, and there is also the danger in large towns of the supply of calves failing, but in country districts if the method adopted by Dr. Street, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of the Central Division, is carried out carefully there will be no failure of calves or any great increase in expenditure. I append some brief notes on the progress attained in the various divisions. Animal vaccination in Western Registration Dis- trict. In the Western Registration District animal lymph is used in the towns of Igatpuri, Kurla, Kalyán and Bandora, and it is hoped that soon other towns and large villages may be per- suaded to use this method. Bombay City. In Bombay City animal lymph has been in use for many years past. There has been some hinderance to the work owing to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease twice during the year. There is a great want of a proper Vaccine Depôt in a central situation with good stabling for the animals. Such a depôt properly constructed and effi- ciently supervised need not be a nuisance in any locality. Central Registration Dis- trict. In the Central Registration District the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner states that the practice of using animal lymph was carried on continuously throughout the year in Poona City, Poona Cantonment, Sholápur City, and the City of Ahmednagar; and in these 8,979 children were vaccinated from calf lymph. Of the minor municipalities of the Poona Zilla, Junnar, Alandi, Jejuri, Sásvad, Sirúr, Talegaon (Dábháde) and Lonávala have voted the sums necessary to pro- vide a calf every six months or annually. Animal lymph was also used in 219 villages; in these, and in 7 municipalities stated above, there were 8,315 children vaccinated with this lymph. Last year the practice was confined to 3 municipalities and 42 villages, and 2,887 children were vaccinated. Much credit is due to Mr. Trimbak Anant, 1st Class Inspector of Sanitation and Vaccination, Poona Zilla, for the interest and zeal he has shown in the work of extending this practice in his district. Animal lymph was, for the first time, introduced into the rural district of Ahmednagar Zilla during the year. It met with much success and 1,873 children were vaccinated from the calf in 81 villages. Mr. Laxumon Khanderao, Inspector of Sanitation and Vaccination of this Zilla, did good work in the extension of the practice in this district.
16 VACCINATION REPORT, Animal vaccination is much needed in large towns of the Central Registra- tion District, such as Sátára, Bársi, Pandharpur, Wái, Karád, Ashta, Islámpur, Tásgaon, Rájápur, Chiplún, Vengurla and Kirkee Cantonment, in which there is always a difficulty in getting the people to give lymph. Animal vaccination in the Southern Registration Dis- trict. In the Southern Registration District animal vaccination was continued in Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli and Gadag towns. In the latter town, however, owing to the local difficulties on account of the famine, animal vaccination was only carried on for about 4 months. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner states that &quot; the quality of animal vaccination in these towns was very satisfactory and a high standard of work was maintained.&quot; Animal vaccination in Sind. In Sind, there is great difficulty in obtaining vaccinifers. This difficulty appears to be on the increase, notwithstanding the payment of the regulated fees to parents owing to objection against lymph being taken from the ripe vesicles. It is hoped that soon the larger towns will be prevailed upon to supply the money to obtain calves at least twice a year so as to do away with the difficulty as regards the regular supply of human lymph. In the town of Karáchi animal vaccination was performed throughout the year. Animal lymph in tubes, forwarded to vaccinators, though not successful in some instances, was most successful when it was taken direct from calves parti- cularly in the cold weather. Heifers inoculated. 40. The following table shows the number of heifers inoculated in some of the towns where animal vaccination was performed during the year, and the result of the operations by months from April 1892 to March 1893 inclusive :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 17 Expenditure. 41.

The results given by vaccinators were 31,052 as successful, 430 unsuccessful exclusive of 47 secondary operations, and 1,712 unknown ; while on inspection the figures were to be 21,424, 337 and 11,432 respectively, besides, one whose absence could not be accounted for. Excluding the &quot; unknown &quot; or rather the number of children &quot; absent &quot; at the time of inspection from both sides, the vaccinator's figures give the percentages of 98.49 as successful and 1.51 as unsuccessful, while the inspection figures return them as 98.45 and 1.55 respectively. Again, out of 21,424 successful children there were 17,639 or 82.33 per cent. who had good cicatrices on their arms, 1,032 or 4.82 per cent. middling, and 2,753 or 12.85 per cent. &quot;bad.&quot; These results show the degree of protection afforded. The number of children whose arms were inspected without the register test was 11,863, of whom 10,350 were in the Southern, 703 in the Central, 662 in the Western and 148 in the Sind Registration District. In the Gujarát Regis- tration District, no inspections were held without the register test. Work of Inspectors and Assistant Superintendents. 44.

Out of 303,772 children inspected, 294,751 were protected and in 9,021 cases the operation was unsuccessful. Again, out of 294,751 suc- cessful cases, 218,077 had good cicatrices, 29,081 &quot;middling&quot; and 47,593 &quot;bad&quot; In the registers tested the results were entered as 397,991 successful, 7,914 unsuccessful and doubtful, 18,006 unknown or absent, and 589 secondary opera- tions. The greatest number of children inspected was in the Southern Registra- tion District and the greatest number of villages seen was in Sind. Conduct of members in the Department. 45.

There is no doubt that keeping up fresh lymph by arm- to-arm vaccination is becoming difficult, especially in large towns, owing to the refusal of parents to allow the lymph to be extracted from the ripe vesicles, there is not nearly so much objection to the operation for inserting the fresh lymph. It is hoped that the using of animal lymph will be pushed on without friction in all divisions as has been done in the Central Registration District, and then a Compulsory Act can be put in force in the areas using animal lymph without any trouble.

No. 2980. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 24th August 1893. Letter from the Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay, No. 1616-B., dated 23rd June 18932 sioner to the prevalence of fever and cholera and to the scarcity. The scarcity was much more felt in 1891-92 than in 1892-93, but as the season of the latter year was decidedly more unhealthy, and the mortality from cholera and fever was much above the average, the Sanitary Commissioner's explanation may be accepted as correct. In the Presidency Circle there was a falling off of 2.55 per cent., and it is stated that owing to an attack of foot and mouth disease among the calves lymph could not be obtained in sufficient quantity. In Native State circles Pálanpur and Cutch give the worst results, and no explanation has been given for the marked decrease. 3. The difference in the number of cases of re-vaccination in 1892-93, as compared with 1891-92, is slight, but in the Presidency District and in the Gujarát Division the reduction is much to be regretted. An examination of the figures for the last ten years shows that but little real progress has as yet been made in this important matter, and Government hope that no efforts will be spared by the sanitary officers to show a marked improvement in future years. 4. The percentage of successful primary vaccination is given as 94.56 and of re-vaccination as 58.74. In the Presidency Circle there is as usual a considerable variation under the latter head. The figures for the last four years are 18.09, 38.08, 75.34 and 51.95 respectively. No explanation has been offered, but it is gathered from previous reports that unknown results are the disturbing factor, and it would be interesting if the percentage of success, excluding these cases, were also furnished. In Cutch, under the same head, the rate fell from 70 to 50.85 and here again no cause has been assigned. A review of the tables given in paragraphs 15 and 22 of the report shows that much remains to be done towards putting the vaccination of infants on a satisfactory footing. In Kánara the number of successful operations on infants was only 12.30 per mille of population and the percentage protected was only 48.63, and it is to be regretted that the attention which the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner appears to have given to the district has not succeeded in producing better results. In the other three districts of the Southern Registration District the percentage pro- tected was also much below the average. In Khándesh, Násik and Thána also the figures are not very satisfactory, but this is no doubt partly due to the absence of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. The rates given in the tables referred to cannot of course be looked on as entirely accurate; they vary according to the accuracy or incorrectness of the registration of vital statistics, but in most dis- tricts they give a fair idea of the work done. 5. The Sanitary Commissioner expresses satisfaction with the amount of work done by the Inspecting officers. It seems to Government, however, that their tours might be more systematically arranged, so that if any part of a district cannot be visited in one year it may receive attention in the next. The details of the tours in 1890-91 are not available, but a comparison of those made in the last two years shows several defects. Thus, in the Western Registration District, parts of Násik and Khándesh have not been visited: in the Central Registration District, Ratnágiri seems to have been somewhat neglected, four tálukas only having been inspected last year, and three of these again in the year under review; in the Southern Registration District, Kánara alone seems to have received much attention, though as already remarked the results are not encouraging, while Bijápur was not visited at all in 1892-93 and only two tálukas were inspected in 1891-92 and one in 1889-90: in the Gujarát Registra- tion District, only one táluka of the Panch Maháls has been visited in the last two years: in the Sind Registration District, the tours are generally more satis- factory than in the Presidency proper. Government trust that the Sanitary Commissioner will take steps to ensure that no district is in future neglected, and in the annual report information should be given not merely of the total numbers examined in each Registration District, but also of the amount of inspection work done and the time spent in travelling in each Collectorate.
3 6. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,794. against 1,860 in 1891-92 and 1,766 in 1890-91. The highest average in British Districts occurs in Bijápur (2,489) and the lowest in Karáchi (1,089). In the Collectorates of the Central District alone is there any uniformity : in all the others the variation is considerable. In Kolába the average was 1,323 and in Ratnágiri 2,105, showing a difference which it is difficult to understand. Dhár- wár (1,676) and Bijápur (2,489) are in marked contrast and the variation is still greater if the rural circles only are compared. Karáchi has the lowest average in Sind, and Government have in a former review remarked that the difficulties in this district are not great. The Sanitary Commissioner should, when possible, notice and account for any great discrepancies in adjacent districts. 7.

In accordance with Government Resolution, in the General Department,No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, the report on Vaccina- tion for 1893-94 consists of brief notes and the usual statements. Vaccination in Native States. 2. By Government Resolution, in the Political Department, No. 7260 of15th December 1893, this department was relieved of the control and responsibility of vaccination work in the Idar State of the Mahi Kántha Agency, the vaccination establishment having been handed over to the Darbár. The total work of that State is, therefore, shown in a separate line in this report, as is done in the case of Baroda, Cutch, Káthiáwár, and Pálanpur States. Strength of the Department. 3.

B 2822 It will be seen from the foregoing table, that in the British Districts, there were 710,259 persons primarily vaccinated and 63,276 re-vaccinated against 729,032 and 60,120 respectively last year, showing a net decrease of 18,773 or 2.58 per cent in primary vaccination, and a net increase of 3,156 or 5.25 per cent in re-vaccination. In total operations there is a decrease of 15,617 or 1.98 per cent over the preceding year. Although there has been a considerable increase in re-vaccination this year, still much more might be done if the vaccinators were allowed to visit the schools of the towns and villages in their districts and re-vaccinate all children over 10 or 12 years of age. The people generally are much opposed to re-vacci- nation. In the Presidency Circle, the variation in the number of re-vaccinations chiefly depends upon the pilgrim ships. Increased difficulties are felt in extending vaccination owing to a growing feeling of opposition among the people of large towns, as they know that they are not bound by law to submit to it, and they, therefore, refuse to give lymph in arm-to-arm work. Complaints from vaccinators regarding such difficulties and the opposition to vaccination work for want of a compulsory Act are frequently made. The delay in making the Compulsory Vaccination Act operative is, therefore, much felt in some towns. Infants successfully vacci- nated as compared with available number. 5. The following table shows the number of infants successfully vaccinatedin the Presidency exclusive of Native States. The birth and death statistics are taken for the calendar year, as usual, in calculating the number available forvaccination, because infants are generally not vaccinated until three months afterbirth: Years.

Out of 710,259 persons primarily vaccinated, 666,458 or 93.82 per centwere successful. The number of unsuccessful cases was 10,222. In 34,703 cases the result was &quot; un- known,&quot; as the children were not again brought for inspection. 1,124 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. The percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases was 98.49. Results in Re-vaccination. 7. During the year 63,276 persons were re-vaccinated. The number ofsuccessful cases was 37,289 or 58.93 per cent. In 12,035 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 13,964 the operation failed, whilst in 12 cases the re-vaccination was repeated.

It has been found by experience that owing to the large area of the dis- tricts and the various duties connected with sanitary inspection of important towns, it is impossible for the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to visit every táluka for thorough vaccination inspection oftener than once in two years. Almost all the rural and town circles have, however, been visited by the Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination during each year:

It will be seen from the foregoing table that there were 712,356 persons primarily vaccinated and 61,170 re-vaccinated against 710,259 and 63,276 re- spectively last year, showing a net increase of 2,097 or 0.29 per cent. in primary vaccination and a net decrease of 2,106 or 3.33 per cent. in re-vaccination. In total operations there is a decrease of 9 only. Increase and decrease. 8. There is a considerable decrease in the Central and Gujarát Regis- tration Districts and a slight decrease in the Presidency Circle, whilst a considerable increase is recorded in the Southern, Sind and Western Registration Districts. In Aden, Muskat and Bushire as well as in the Native Army there is a decrease but in British Army there is an increase of 308 over the preceding year. In the Central Registration District the decrease is said to be &quot;owing to there having been 5,481 fewer births registered during the year and to there having been a greatly increased preval- ence of cholera and small-pox.&quot; With regard to the decrease in the Gujarát Registration District Dr. Dyson says that &quot; the causes of less work may be stat- ed shortly as sickness real or imaginary among vaccinators and disease and ill- ness among children. The unhealthiness of the year is shown by the increase in infant mortality. There were 5,442 more deaths among infants and children under one year of age than in the preceding year.&quot; 9. In the Sind Registration District, although there is an increase both under primary and re-vaccination, still the &quot; opposition that exists in some parts of the province to both vaccination and re-vaccination presents a most serious obstacle to the progress of the work. The matter has received much care and study, and it is interesting to note that the antagonism emanates from some dozen centres, the opposing element being composed of the well-to-do classes, many persons being Subordinate Officials in Government employ. Enquiry has elicited the fact that in Hyderabad, Shikárpur, Sukkur, Rohri, Sehwan, Tátta, Hálla and one or two other towns, a most stubborn opposition exists3 Years. Births re- turned as having been registered. Deaths regis- tered among children under one year. Children available for vaccination. Children under one year vacci- nated success- fully.

Out of 537,624 infants available for vaccination under one year 439,743 or 81.79 per cent have been protected. Results in primary vacci- nation. 11. Out of 712,356 persons primarily vaccinated 665,883 or 93.48 per cent. were successful. The number of unsuccessful cases was 10,175. In 37,587 cases the result was &quot;un- known &quot; as the children were not again brought for in- spection. 1,289 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. The percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown&quot; cases was 98.50. Results in re-vaccination. 12. During the year 61,170 persons were re-vaccinated. The number of successful cases was 35,625 or 58.24 per cent. In 14,831 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 10,893 the operation failed, whilst in 179 cases the re-vaccination was repeated. The percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown cases &quot; was 76.59. Percentage of success, in- cluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases. 13.

The subjoined table gives the rate of primary successful vaccination of children under one year, and the total successful primary vaccinations per mille of population of each Collectorate and Native State (the vaccination work of which is under the supervision of the Sanitary Department) as desired by Government in paragraph 4 of their Resolution in the General Department No. 4748 of 4th December 1890. It is hardly necessary to remark that it would be more reasonable to compare infantile vaccinations with the births than with the population of all ages :5 Sex. 16. There were 365,421 males and 346,935 females primarily vaccinated, and 44,969 males and 16,201 females re-vaccinated, the totals of persons operated on were 410,390 males and 363,136 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages were respectively 51.28 males and 48.72 females. In re-vaccination the percentages were respectively 73.51 and 26.49 and in total operations 53.06 and 46.94. Caste or race. 17. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 4,757 Christians, 542,361 Hindus 111,714 Musalmans 1,971 Parsis and 51,553 persons of other castes. Age. 18. The age details are compiled for three periods viz:6 Villages visited and not visited by vaccinators. 21. The following statement shows the number of villages visited as well as those left unvisited by the vaccinators of the De- partment in each District and Native States during the year under report, as per para. 5 of Government Reso- lution in the General Department, No. 4748 of 4th December 1890 :DIAGRAM showing the average proportion of population protected, and the average death-rate, from small-pox, per 10,000 of population during the ten years 1884-85 to1893-94 inclusive.

7 City; of the minor Municipalities, Junnar, Alandi, Jejuri, Sásvad, Sirúr, Tale- gaon (Dábháde) Lonávla, and Bárámati have voted the sums necessary to pro- vide a calf every 6 months. The Bársi and Pandharpur Municipalities have this year provided a calf every four months, while in the Ratnágiri Zilla, Chip- lun Municipality provided a calf this year for the first time. Animal vaccina- tion was also carried on in 7 tálukas of Ahmednagar, 5 of Sholápur, 2 of Sátára, 2 of Ratnágiri, and 7 of the Poona Collectorate. In the Southern Registration District, animal vaccination was continued in the Municipal Towns of Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli and Gadag, Bettigeri and in the Cantonment of Belgaum. In Sind, animal vaccination was confined to the Town of Karáchi only. Lymph. 25. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good. Two consignments of English lymph of 65 tubes (45 huma- nized and 20 calf) each were received during the year. Lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. Inoculation. 26. Inoculation was not reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency, and no instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccina- tion. C. W. MACRURY, Brig.-Sur.

There is a net increase of 20,292 or 2.85 per cent. in primary vaccination and 16,986 or 27.77 per cent. in revac- cination or a total increase of 37,278 or 4.82 per cent. as compared with last year. 11. In primary vaccination a considerable decrease is shown in the Central Registration District and a slight decrease under Dispensaries. In all other Districts there is an increase under this head. 12. In revaccination the only decrease is shown against Aden Circle. 13. The total increase is spread over all Districts and Circles in the Presi- dency except the Central Registration District and Dispensaries. Causes of decrease. 14. The decrease under primary vaccination in the Central Registration District is thus accounted for by Dr. Street, the De- puty Sanitary Commissioner of the District: 4 VACCINATION REPORT, influenced by healthy or unhealthy years and the prevalence or absence of sickness at the time of the vaccinator's visit, also of course by the birth rate, which in some parts is greatly affected by the absence of the residents, sometimes both husband and wife and sometimes only the man, who go to Bombay or elsewhere for work.'' The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner also states, besides the above reasons for a decrease in primary operations in his division, that there is still some opposition to vaccination; that in Ratnágiri, besides the usual exodus of the people in search of work, more vaccinators are required, and that sickness amongst children and vaccinators all tended to make the decrease. The decrease under the total operations amongst dispensaries was due to the transfer of vaccination work from Medical Officers in charge Dharangaon of the Western and Sháhápur and Terdal of the Southern Registration Districts to táluka vaccinators in those Districts, Infants successfully vac- cinated as compared with available number; births minus deaths. 15. The following table shows the number of infants successfully vaccinated in the Presidency, ex- clusive of Native States. The birth and death statistics are taken for the calendar year, as usual, in calculat- ing the number available for vaccination :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 5 that the registered birth-rate of the city is a very low one. In Shikárpur also the registered rural birth-rate is low. The total shows that out of 554,221 infants available for vaccination under one year, 442,713 or 79.88 per cent. were protected and 111,508 or 20.12 per cent. remained unprotected.

8 VACCINATION REPORT, Caste or race. 17. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 5,218 Christians, 548,663 Hindus, 119,943 Musalmáns, 2,131 Pársis and 56,693 persons of other castes. The respective figures in the preceding year were 4,757, 542,361, 111,714, 1,971 and 51,553. Age. 18. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under 1 year, between 1 and 6 years, and above 6 years. The num- bers under each period primarily vaccinated were 563,540, 153,583 and 15,525 against 554,521, 144,775 and 13,060 during the previous year. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 528,595 ; of children between 1 and 6 years 142,279 and of persons of other ages 12,170. Thus out of every 100 persons primarily vaccinated 76.92 were infants, of whom 72.15 were successfully vaccinated. Sex. 19. There were 376,197 males and 356,451 females primarily vaccinated; the re-vaccinated were respectively 58,621 and 19,535 and the totals of persons operated on were 434,818 males and 375,986 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages are respectively 51.35 and 48.65 against 51.30 and 48.70 in the previous year. In revaccination they were respectively 75.01 and 24.99 against 73.51 and 26.49, and in total operations 53.63 and 40.37 against 53.05 and 46.95 last year.

The following table shows, by Districts and Circles, the percentage of success in primary and revaccination, contrasted with those for the previous year :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 9 Rate per mille of popula- tion in successful vaccina- tions. 22. The subjoined table gives the rate of primary successful vaccination of children under one year and the total successful primary vaccinations per mille of population of each Collectorate and Native State (the vaccination work of which is under the supervision of the Sanitary Department) as desired by Government in paragraph 4 of their Resolution in the General Department, No. 4748 of 4th December 1890 :10 VACCINATION REPORT, Available infants estimated at 31 per mille of population. 23. The following table shows the. number of infants or children under one year protected out of those available for vaccina- tion at the rate of 31 per mille of population, by Dis- tricts and Circles, as likwise those that remained unprotected and the percentages of the protected and unprotected:BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 11 tablishments were 633,044 and unsuccessful were 10,199, whilst in revaccination they were 45,238 and 12,434 respectively. The total successful cases were 728,282 and unsuccessful 22,633. In 61,163 cases the result was unknown, and 1,274 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. Percentages of success by establishments. 26. The percentages of successful cases in each kind of operation by establishments are given below:12 VACCINATION REPORT, In Cantonments there is an increase of 370 under primary vaccination and 147 under revaccination.

As stated in paragraph 3 of this report, the vaccination statistics of Baroda, Cutch, Káthiáwár, Pálanpur and I'dar have been shown separately in Ap- pendix II. In primary vaccination there is a decrease of 511 in the Native States of the Central Registration District and in revaccination a decrease of 336 in those of the Southern Registration District. There are 78 vaccinators who performed 119,069 primary vaccinations and 11,567 revaccinations, of which 113,407 under primary and 7,835 under revaccinations were successful. The unsuccessful and unknown under primary vaccination numbered 1,720 and 4,306, respectively, and in revaccination 1,682 and 2,050. There were 364 secondary operations, whilst no revaccination was repeated. Work of Dispensary Officers. 33. Vaccination was carried on in 8 dispensaries during the year under report.

The average number of persons operated on by different establishments is specified below for the years 1894-95 and 1895-96 :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 15 The average in the Western Registration District is not so high as it should be, but this may he due to the increase in the number of vaccinators ; but more work is required in Khándesh District, in which the total number of operations has fallen off since last year, though additional strength has been given to the District. Kolába Zilla, though the average work per vaccinator is higher than last year, does not show to advantage beside the adjoining districts of Thána on one side and Ratnágiri on the other. In Kolába, however, vaccination work is with difficulty carried on owing to opposition of the people and so the number of vaccinators has been increased so that every village can be visited and vaccination offered to the people, and thus in Kolába the average number of people to each vaccinator is 42,491, whilst in Thána it is 54,027, and in Ratnágiri 72,099, whilst the average popula- tion per square mile is respectively 270, 215 and 276. Of course the larger the number of the population to each vaccinator the more chance he has of getting subjects to vaccinate. In the Central Registration District the average is maintained throughout and in the Southern Registration District, excepting Kárwár, where owing to the hilly nature of the district, its unhealthiness, and the way the hamlets are scattered, work is difficult, the Dhárwár District is the one which shows a comparatively low average, but here there is one vaccinator to every 51,568 of population, whilst in Belgaum it is 55,882 and in Bijápur 69,231. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in charge states that some of the vaccinators are lazy, but the average is not at all bad. In Gujárat Circle also the average standard is a high one but varies also with the average population to each Local Fund Vaccinator. In Kaira it is one vaccinator to 44,774 people, whilst in Surat, Broach and Ahmedabad it is respectively 1 to 60,144, 60,264 and 63,067. English lymph. 37. There were altogether two consignments of English lymph in Novem- ber 1895 and March 1896. Forty-five tubes of huma- nized and 20 of bovine lymph were received each time. In Aden calf lymph was sent direct regularly once a quarter from England. It was in each quarter successful there except in September, when it entirely failed. The table below shows the results of the lymph distributed in the Presi- dency:16 VACCINATION REPORT, Superintendent of Vaccination, Allahabad, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, North-West Provinces and Oudh, the Agency Surgeon, Kotah and Jháláwar, the State Surgeon, Dewas, and the Senior Medical Officer, Hingoli H. C. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, supplied lymph to the Assistant Surgeons in charge Khárághoda and Sádra dispensaries. In the Presidency Circle there were 945 applications for lymph against 654 in 1894-95. The total number of tubes issued was 2,339. Of these, 516 were supplied free of charge to Civil Surgeons, to Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, to Medical Officers in charge of Army hospitals in the mofussil, and to Medical Officers of Her Majesty's Troop-ships in the harbour. The remaining 1,823 tubes were sold to private parties in the city as well as in the mofussil. During the year nine inoculated calves were supplied as under : four to the Bándra Municipality, one to the Kurla Municipality, two to the Igatguri Municipality, one to the Alibág Municipality, and one to a gentleman at Daman. Animal vaccination. 39. Animal vaccination is being gradually ex- tended, and it is satisfactory to note that this mode of vaccinating is appreciated. Animal vaccination in the Western Registration Dis- trict. 40. In the Western Registration District animal lymph is used in the towns of Igatpuri, in the Násik Collectorate, Kurla and Bándra in the Thána Collectorate, and Alibág, Nágaon and Panvel in the Kolába Collectorate. The number of persons vaccinated with animal lymph in these towns during the year was 941 primary and 369 revaccination, the successful cases under each head being 873 and 191 respectively. Animal vaccination in Bombay City. 41. In the city of. Bombay animal lymph has been in use for many years past. During the year 584 calves were inoculated : of these, no less than 59 were rejected on account of sickness, nine were supplied to mofussil municipalities and other constituents. The total number of insertions made on the calves was 95,845, each calf having on an average 185 insertions. 93,349 insertions were successful, the percentage of success being 97.39. Animal vaccination in the Central Registration District. 42. In the Central Registration District the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner states that the practice of using animal lymph was carried on continuously during the year with a considerable amount of success. It was carried on throughout the year in Poona City, Poona Cantonment, Sholápur City and Ahmednagar City. Of the minor municipalities, Junnar, Alandi, Jejuri, Sásvad, Sirúr, Talegaon Dábháda, Lonávla and Bárámati have provided sums for a calf every six months. The municipalities of Sangamner, Vámbori and Bhingár have also provided sums for a calf every six months. The Bársi and Pandhar- pur Municipalities have provided a calf every four months. In Ratnágiri Zilla, Chiplún Municipality provided a calf. A few large villages provide funds to furnish a calf every six months and some once a year. Many other villages lend a calf for vaccination purposes. Animal vaccination was carried on in the tálukas of Sangamner, Párner, Nevása, Ráhuri, Shrigonda and Nagar of the Ahmednagar Collectorate; Sholápur, Pandharpur, Málsiras, Mádha, Bársi and Akalkot State in the Sholápur Collectorate; tálukas of Sátára, Mán, Karád. Pátan, and the Phaltan State in the Sátára Collectorate; tálukas of Purandhar, Khed, Bhimthadi, Haveli, Máwal, Sirúr, and Junnar of the Poona Collectorate ; and Chiplún Táluka of the Ratnágiri Collectorate. Thus 19,071 children were vaccinated in 494 villages of the abovementioned tálukas. Animal vaccination was also carried on in three municipalities during the year and in one Canton- ment, and in these 8,804 children were vaccinated. The total number of persons vaccinated with calf lymph in Poona, Sholápur and Nagar towns and in the rural districts was 27,875. In January 1896 animal vaccination was success- fully introduced for the first time into Sátára City and is to be carried on continuously if funds admit. It was also introduced for the first time into the Phaltan State, and a large amount of work was done. It was very much needed as, owing to the difficulty of getting the people to give lymph and to their abstaining from having their children vaccinated owing to the fear of lymph being taken from them, the numbers vaccinated were very much falling off. It is very much appreciated by the people, and during the last quarter of the year 433 children were vaccinated. Animal vaccination is now carried on
BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 17 continuously in all the four large Collectorate towns in the Central Registration District. All animal vaccination is direct from the calf and, except in munici- palities, is carried on without any extra cost, the people lending calves or, in a few cases, providing the means to procure them, and any small expenditure such as shaving, &c., is met from contingencies. The following statement shows the number and results of vaccinations done with human and animal lymph during the year 1895-96 in this district:18 VACCINATION REPORT, Heifers inoculated. 45. The following table shows the number of heifers inoculated in some of the towns where animal vaccination was performed during the year and the result of the operations by months from April 1895 to March 1896 inclusive :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 19 The increase under &quot; Provincial&quot; is chiefly due to the fact that the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, had drawn the permanent pay of his appointment during the year, and to the increased rate of the exchange compensation drawn by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, Western Registration District and Sind Registration District. Under Municipal and Cantonment there is a slight increase, due to increased prices having to be given for calves in the Central Registration District and to an extra temporary municipal vaccinator being employed in Ahmedabad, whilst under Local Fund there is a decrease of Rs. 1,493-6-0, which chiefly occurs in the Central Registration District, and is owing to the fact that bills due in 1893-94 were paid in 1894-95, thus unduly increasing the total for that year. In the year under report this has not occurred, and hence the decrease. Under Native States there is an increase of Rs 2,529-10-2 over the preceding year. The net increase over the preceding year was Rs. 6,277-6-4. The total cost of all charges for the entire Presidency during the year was Rs. 2,81,407-12-8, whilst the successful cases, excluding Dispensaries and the Army, amounted to 721,899. The average cost for each successful case was annas 6 and pies 3, against annas 6 and pies 2 in the preceding year. Work of Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners. 47. The inspectorial work performed by the supervising officers is shown in the table below :20 VACCINATION REPORT, It will be seen from the foregoing tables that out of 58,263 children inspect- ed, the results in 42,707 instances were tested by calling their names from registers, in which there were enrolled 75,171 names, of whom 96 were vaccinat- ed more than once on account of the failure of the first operation. The results given by vaccinators were 68,248 as successful, 1,537 unsuccessul, exclusive of 96 secondary operations, and 5,290 unknown ; while on inspection the figures were 41,649, 1,058 and 32,368 respectively. Excluding the &quot; unknown,&quot; or rather the number of children ' absent' at the time of inspection from both sides, the vaccinators' figures give the percentages of 97.66 as successful and 2.34 as unsuccessful, while the inspection figures return them as 97.52 and 2.48 respec- tively. Out of 41,649 children successful 32,616 or 78.31 per cent. were marked as having ' good ' cicatrices and 9,033 or 21.69 per cent. as ' bad.' Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 49. The following table shows the amount of inspection work done during the working season of the year 1895-96 and the time spent in inspection in each Collectorate by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, as required by paragraph 5 of Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 2980 of 24th August 1893. It has already been explained that owing to the large area of the Districts and the various duties connected with sanitary inspection of important towns it is impossible for the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to visit every táluka for thorough vaccination inspection oftener than once in two years. Almost all the rural and town circles have, however, been visited by the Inspec- tors of Sanitation and Vaccination during the year :BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 21 Districts and Circles.

The names of 410,256 children were called from registers, of whom 292,297 were present and 117,953 absent, but their absence was accounted for, whilst 6 had migrated. Out of 292,297 children inspected 234,219 were protected and in 8,078 cases the operation was unsuccessful. Again out of 284,219 successful cases 226,707 had good cicatrices and 57,512 &quot; bad.&quot; In the registers tested the results were entered as 377,876 successful, 7,070 unsuccessful and doubtful, 25,699 unknown or absent and 389 secondary operations. The greatest number of children inspected was in the Southern Regis- tration District and the greatest number of villages seen was in Sind. Conduct of members in the Department. 51. The conduct of the inspecting officers was reported to be satisfactory. The conduct of the vacci- nators, clerks and peons, with few exceptions, was gene- rally good. Inoculation. 52. No inoculation was reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency, except in the Dángs under the Khándesh Agency, which is being enquired into. Ill effects by vaccination. 53. No instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccination except that the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, reports a death attributed to erysipelas following vaccination occurred in a rickety child in Vengurla town. Three other cases of erysipelas after vaccination also occurred in the same town, but from enquiries made it appears that there was a case existing in the town entirely unconnected with vaccination and that in two of the four cases the lymph used was not that in use in the town. Villages visited and not visited by vaccinators. 54. The following statement shows the number of villages visited, as well as those left unvisited, by the vaccinators of the depart- ment in each District and Native States during the year under report, as per paragraph 5 of Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 4748 of 4th December 1890 :22 VACCINATION REPORT, It will be seen that out of 51,213 villages in the Presidency, 42,947 were visited by vaccinators and 8,266 or 19.25 per cent. were not visited. In the British territory 36,051 villages were visited and 6,728 or 18.66 per cent. remain- ed unvisited, whilst in Native States the percentage of unvisited villages was 22.30. Practical instruction in animal vaccination. 55. Dr. Channer, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registra- tion District, and Dr. Street, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, gave lectures and practical demonstrations in animal vaccination to the several Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination and vaccina- tors in their districts during the rains. In the city of Bombay the class for instruction was open during the months of August and September 1895. Here 20 subordinates in all, attended the course, of whom 2 were vaccinators, 5 paid candidates, 12 unpaid candidates, and one clerk. Practical instruction was imparted also to one L. M. & S., 5 medical students, and 15 Military medical pupils. Small-pox by Collectorates. 56.

BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 23 spection of all of them, and I shall be prepared to do it without any way inconveniencing the school work.&quot; In the Rural Circles the largest mortality is shown in the Khándesh and Násik Districts. In Khándesh the small-pox has been advancing from the eastern side in spite of every effort to stop it. It is in the larger towns and villages that there is a difficulty in doing work, especially revaccination. This year it has spread into the Násik Zilla and there were sharp outbreaks at Yeola and Málegaon towns. In the latter town alone over 32 per cent. of the total deaths reported in the district occurred. This town has a large poor and dirty population of the weaver class who have come in from another district and they overcrowd in badly ventilated huts, and when disease appears it takes a firm hold. In Hyderabad Collectorate also of the deaths reported, more than half occurred in the town itself. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, enquired into 1,577 cases of small-pox, and of these 718 were previously vaccinated and 859 were unprotected. Among the 718 vaccinated 38 died or 5.29 per cent., whilst of the 859 unvaccinated 146 died or 16.99 per cent. In the Násik District 606 cases of small-pox were enquired into, 159 were previously vaccinated and 447 were not. Of those previously vaccinated 31 died or 19.49 per cent., whilst of the 447 not vaccinated 217 died or 48.54 per cent. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, remarks on the opposition to vaccination in Hyderabad town and the difficult conditions which prevail there, on which a good deal of correspondence has passed.

The Civil, Revenue and Political officers have rendered aid when required to the officers of this department. I would bring to the favourable notice of Government the tact and energy shown in the discharge of their duties by the supervising officers, Drs. Channer, Street, Dyson, Arnim, and Anderson, and Assistant Surgeon S. V. Kantak. Drs. Dyson and Arnim have shown increased results for the year in their dis- tricts, and Drs. Channer and Street are meeting with gratifying results in push- ing vaccination with animal lymph. Assistant Surgeon S. V. Kantak and his staff have shown great zeal in coping with the large amount of work caused by the rush for vaccination and revaccination due to the prevalence of small- pox in Bombay. Dr. Street also records that &quot; Mr. Trimbak Anant, 1st Class Inspector, has retired after more than forty-two years of very meritorious service. His experi- ence and advice will be a loss to the department. He was connected with the Vaccination Department in its infancy and did much good work in extending vaccination. He carried out the details of the introduction of animal vaccina- tion in Poona City and Cantonment and also its extension for the first time with the rural districts of this Circle and, I believe, of the Presidency, and this he did with much success.&quot; My Assistant Mr. Keess and the office establishment worked hard and gave me every assistance.

In accordance with Government Resolution, in the General Department, No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, the report on vaccina- tion for 1896-97 consists of brief notes and the usual statements. Vaccination in Native States. 2. By Government Resolutions, in the General Department, Nos. 2803 and 4762, dated respectively 27th July and 18th December 1894, the vaccination statistics of the following Native States are shown separately in Appendix II :2 Reasons of decrease. 5. The decrease is chiefly distributed in the Presi- dency Circle, Bombay, and in the Sind Registration District. 6. In the City of Bombay the decrease was due chiefly to the occurrence of the plague which prevailed during the second half of the year. 7. In the Sind Registration District, the decrease is thus accounted for by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner :3 Percentage of success ex- cluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases. 12. The following table shows the percentages of success both in primary and revaccination excluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases during 1896-97 contrasted with those for the preceding year as desired by Government in paragraph 4 of their Resolution in the General Department, No. 2980 of 24th August 1893 :4 Districts and Circles.

Progress of animal vaccina- tion. 22. Animal vaccination was carried on in the following places of the Bombay Presidency during the year. 23. In the Western Registration District, vaccination with animal lymph was performed during the year in 2 Municipalities and 4 villages of Khándesh, in 2 Municipalities and 14 villages of Násik, in 3 Municipalities and 1 village of Thána, and in 5 Municipalities and 1 village of Kolába Collectorate, and also in the Janjira Native State. There were 2,158 primary and 406 revaccinations per- formed in the above named places. 24. In the City of Bombay vaccination with animal lymph exclusively was carried on throughout the year. 25. In the Central Registration District, animal vaccination was carried on continuously throughout the year in Poona City, Poona Cantonment, and in the towns of Ahmednagar, Sholápur and Sátára. In the Poona Collectorate, the Kirkee Cantonment Committee has provided a sum for three calves monthly. Of the minor Municipalities, Junnar, Álandi, Jejuri, Sásvad, Sirúr, Talegaon (Dábhada,) Lonávla and Bárámati have provided sums for a calf every six months. In the Ahmednagar Collectorate, the Municipalities of Sangamner, Vámbori and Bhingár have provided sums for a calf every six months. In the Ratnágiri Zilla the Chiplún Municipality has provided a calf every six months. The Bársi and Pandharpur Municipalities in the Sholápur Collectorate have provided a calf every four months. The practice was introduced for the first time in the chief towns of Bhor and Aundh Native States. Animal vaccination was also carried on in 6 tálukas of Ahmednagar, in 5 of Sholápur, in 1 of Ratnágiri, in 7 of Sátára, and in 7 of the Poona Collectorate. 26. In the Southern Registration District, animal vaccination was continued in Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli, Gadag-Bettigeri Municipal towns and was intro- duced into Annigeri of the Navalgund Táluka and Bayádgi of the Ránebennur Táluka in the Dhárwár Collectorate. It was also introduced into the Sávanur Native State, and continued in Kolhápur and Sángli Native States. 27. In the Gujarát Registration District, during the year animal vaccination was introduced in Ahmedabad City. The work was begun during the monsoon, and the first results were not very successful, but during the fair season up to the end of the year, a continuous supply of animal lymph has been kept up, so as to maintain one day a week of animal vaccination. 28. In the Sind Registration District, operations direct from the calf lymph were only performed in the town of Karáchi throughout the year, and without opposition. Lymph. 29 The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good. Two con- signments of English lymph of 65 tubes (45 huma- nized and 20 calf), each were received during the year.
7 Lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. 30. Inoculation was not reported to have been practised any where in the Presidency, and no instances were reported of any disease having been commu- nicated through vaccination. A question was raised regarding the likelihood of the transmission of plague by means of the vaccine lymph. As regards calf to arm vaccination, there seems to me to be no danger. The calves are passed as sound, kept in certain number of days before inoculation, and before taking the lymph for vaccination purposes the animal is examined as regards its health and temperature. There has been no report that any case of plague has occurred by means of animal vaccination, and it has been continued without bad result, although the byres in Bombay are far from being the healthy sanitary structures they should be. In the case of arm to arm vaccination, although no proof was forthcoming that plague could be propagated in this way, it was considered advisable to stop it in plague centres. The subject of the transmissibility of plague through animals and human beings by means of vaccine lymph might be made the subject of enquiry by the Scientific Research Committee. J. W.

In accordance with Government Resolution in the General Department,No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, the report on vaccina- tion for 1897-98 consists of brief notes and the usual statements. Vaccination in Native States. 2. By Government Resolutions in the General Department, Nos. 2803 and4762, dated respectively 27th July and 18th December 1894, the vaccination statistics of the following Native States are shown separately in Appendix II:2 Abolition of two places of Municipal vaccinators. 5. By Government Resolutions in the General Department, Nos. 1951 and2845, dated 9th April and 25th May 1897 respectively, two appointments of Municipal vaccinatorships, namely, of Dholka Town in the Ahmedabad Collectorate andDhulia Town in the Khándesh Collectorate, were abolished and their work wastransferred to Local Fund Vaccinators. Strength of the Department. 6. The total strength of the Vaccination Depart- ment during the year 1897-98, excluding Native States, was as follows :3 Army, there is an increase, but in the Native Army there is a decrease of 129over that of the preceding year. With regard to the decrease in the CentralRegistration District, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner says that &quot; the yearhas been a very disastrous one for vaccination owing to the effects of Famineand Plague. In Sholápur Town and in the southern parts of the SátáraCollectorate work had to be stopped altogether for some time on account ofPlague, and in the rest of the Division vaccinators could not work in parts oftheir charges owing to the same cause. The exodus from large towns owing to thepresence of Plague interfered greatly with vaccination work in them. Some ofthe Inspectors and Vaccinators were employed on Plague duty. Inspection workwas also greatly interfered with by Plague and Famine. The Deputy SanitaryCommissioner was on Plague duty throughout the year. Owing to the absenceof the people from their villages during the Famine the usual number of childrenfor inspection could not be obtained.&quot; The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, writes that&quot; the decrease in revaccinations can be largely accounted for by the compa- rative freedom of the district from small-pox during the year. As regards primary vaccination and revaccination combined, the causes of less work may be grouped as follows:4 Number. Districts and Circles. Percentage of success of primary vaccination.

The total expenditure on account of vaccination as compared with thepreceding year, excluding Native States, is shown in the following statement:8 Lymph. 28. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good. Twoconsignments of English lymph, of 65 tubes (45 huma- nized and 20 calf) each, were received during the year. Lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioners and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. 29. Inoculation was not reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency, and no instances were reported of any disease having been commu- nicated through vaccination. 30. The year was a disastrous one for vaccination work, owing to the effects of Famine and Plague. In many parts, the people were on the move and not readily got at, and from many of the large towns there was a large exodus. The death-rate was high, especially among children, and there was a low birth- rate. All these and many minor difficulties made the work of obtaining the usual number of children for vaccination a very difficult matter, and in addition many vaccinators were employed on Plague duty, as were also all the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and many Inspectors. The measures taken for the protection of the Famine camps from small-pox were, however, a matter for congratulation, as vaccination work was carried out systematically in these camps with very satisfactory results. The attacks from small-pox in these camps were 270 and deaths 20. The figures for the camps during the Famine of 1877 are not available, but the extent of the disease in that year compared with the present may be judged from the fact that there were 27,369 deaths in the whole Presidency from small-pox in 1877, while in 1897 there were only 3,835. In addition to the measures taken, this satisfactory result is due to the good vaccination work which now for some years has been done in the Presidency. A. W. F.

It is the custom in some cases for a woman to leave Bombay for her delivery ; this tends to raise the rate, as the birth is not regis- tered in Bombay; but in all probability the child is vaccinated on the woman's return to the city. The rates for the Central and Gujarát districts are good, especially those for the Collectorates of Ahmednagar and Sholápur in the former, as in these the registration of births is well carried out. In Sind the high rates are due to defective birth registration. Particulars of vaccine operations. 13.

The conduct of the Vaccinators, clerks and peons, with few exceptions, was generally good. Inoculation. 46. No inoculation was reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency, except in the Nára Táluka of the Khairpur Native State, and this was inquired into, with the result that the people were warned, and on any repetition of the offence will be dealt with under the Indian Penal Code.

The Western District was the one most affected, after it came the Southern and Central Districts, Sind was very slightly affected, and the Gujarát District gave only 2 deaths. These figures and those for the previous year, which were also low, may be considered very satisfactory and they testify to the exceedingly good vaccination work which now for some years has been done in this Presidency ; but at the same time it must not be thought that we have by any means reached perfection and can relax our efforts, on the contrary there is still a great deal to be done and we are by no means safe from the danger of a widespread and fatal epidemic should the disease appear in severe epidemic form. It is, therefore, to be hoped that the present year will be favourable and that it may be possible to repair the damage sustained through the adverse circumstances of the last two B 32322 VACCINATION REPORT, years, and to proceed with the progress which was being made before the appear- ance of famine and plague. As regards Collectorates, Khándesh was the one most affected and after it Bijápur, Thána, Dhárwár and Kánara gave the largest number of deaths ; all the other Collectorates had less than 100 deaths each, Ahmedabad and Panch Maháls had only 1 death each, and the Collectorates of Ratnágiri, Surat, Broach Kaira, Hyderabad and Shikárpur had none at all. The deaths from small-pox are shown in the table under three age periods, and as percentages to total deaths. Compared with previous years,the tendency is found to be for the deaths under 1 year to decrease, for those above 1 and below 12 to remain about the same, and for those over 12 to increase. As far as primary vaccination is concerned, this is a fairly satisfactory result; but would be more so if the deaths in the first two age periods were lower : however, it is difficult to effect this owing to the absence of compulsory vaccination in towns and to the very extensive areas in charge of rural Vaccinators. The percentages for the Central District do not show a very good result, but this is exceptional, as the record of this district is usually one of the best. The numbers on which, this year, the calculations are made are, however, too small to give results of much value. 50. Small-pox was very prevalent in Southern Arabia during the year, and as a consequence Aden suffered to a certain extent ; but the disease could not be considered epidemic, and most of the cases were contracted outside or were found amongst the homeless vagrants ; in only a few instances was the disease discovered amongst the resident population. Vaccination was pushed as much as possible and 1,106 more persons were operated on than in the preceding year. Vaccination at last seems to be gaining ground among the Arabs in the interior of Arabia. Many of them visiting Aden begged to be operated on, and gave as their reason that those who on former visits to Aden had been vacci- nated, were able to go about among the infected with impunity. At the urgent request of the Sultán of Lahej a Vaccinator was sent there, and operated on 381 persons. At Shaikh Othman, which has an estimated population of 7,000 of whom probably 60 or 70 per cent. are protected, there were during the year under report 160 cases of small-pox which are detailed in the following table :DIAGRAM.

BOMBAY PRESIDENCY. 23 classes of educated people in this country will also learn the same before they are taught it by the same means through which the Arab has gained his knowledge; as, although vaccination has made great progress in this Presidency with satisfactory results and I trust will continue to do so, we cannot expect to be as yet free from the danger of the occurrence of severe epidemics of the disease; and it would be well if those who oppose vaccination were more aware of the fact, and also knew that it is believed that the death-rate among those of the unvaccinated who are attacked by the disease has greatly increased24 VACCINATION REPORT, Bombay from the 1st to 20th April, and from the latter date up to to the end of the year inspected the town of Larkhána and the tálukas of Kotri, Larkhána, Ratodero, Mehar, Labdarya and Jacobabad. Compulsory Vaccination Act in Bombay City. 57. In the City of Bombay the Compulsory Vaccination Act (No. I of 1877) has been in force for 21 years, but is very greatly handicapped by the defective registration of births. The accommodation for calves has been im- proved but it is only temporary, and permanent arrangements are required. A large majority of the vaccination stations are very unsuitable and insanitary ; a central vaccination station and also a depôt for the accommodation of the calves and for the preparation of lymph are very much needed. For the last two and a half years plague has greatly interfered with vaccination work.

In the year under report the Bombay District Vaccination Act (I of 1892) was introduced in the town of Larkhána, Sind : vide Government Resolution in General Department, No. 6847 of the 14th December 1898. 60. As in 1897-98, the year under report was a disastrous one for vaccination work. Firstly, there was during the latter months of 1897 and the early ones of 1898 a very low birth-rate, and a very high death-rate, especially among children : during 1898 the former was very pronounced and it was not until August that much improvement took place; then, there was still a certain amount of famine in some parts, and some other parts had not completely recovered from it; the plague was with us all the year and greatly interfered with work, so much so in some parts that vaccination had to be entirely stopped; nearly all the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were on deputation or leave or on plague duty, and as no full-time officers were appointed, their districts received very little of that inspection and supervision which is so very necessary in order to obtain efficient work, and, lastly, several of the Inspectors and Vaccinators were on plague duty. All these and many minor difficulties made it a very difficult matter to obtain the usual number of children and to carry on the duties of the Depart- ment in the ordinary manner. Remarks explaining the various decreases have not been made after each table as the causes are nearly the same in all, and have been mentioned in paragraph 11 and also in these remarks. It is useless to com- pare either of the last two years with former ones as they have been very abnor- mal ones, and there is also not much profit to be got out of comparing the year under report with the previous one as they each tell almost exactly the same tale. There is now a better birth-rate, it may be said that we have done with famine and its immediate after-effects, and it is to be hoped that the present decrease in plague may continue, so under these circumstances it is believed that better results may be looked for in the present year if only full time Deputy Sanitary Commissioners can be provided. Considering the very adverse circumstances under which work has had to be carried on during the last two years, it is, in my opinion, a matter of congratulation that vaccination work has not suffered more than it has. Fortu- nately there has been no serious epidemic of small-pox to deal with during the last few years, as the deaths from that disease have been low. It is to the good B 32326 VACCINATION REPORT. work which has now for some years been done in the Presidency that we in a great measure owe the small amount of small-pox there has been in these years, more especially in the famine year of 1897 and the year following it. There is, however, still great reason for not relaxing our efforts ; and, although the low death- rates during the last twelve years is very satisfactory, still we are by no means safe from the danger of an extensive and fatal epidemic should the disease assume a severe epidemic form, which it is apt to do at intervals. I believe that this Presidency can compare very favourably with other parts of India in the protection afforded, both as regards quantity and quality, but as regards com- pulsory vaccination it is very much behind many other parts and this prevents us reaching the state of protection we wish to attain, and is likely to affect our efforts in this direction more and more as time goes on. 61. Several of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were on Plague duty, either in a special appointment or in addition to their own duties, and rendered able and valuable service. Those who were on duty in their own appointments performed their duties in a very satisfactory manner. Ráo Bahádur Assistant Surgeon S. V. Kantak in addition to his own duties rendered valuable assistance in the cause of inoculation against plague both in Bombay and in the adjacent districts. My Assistant, Mr. Keess, and the office establishment worked hard and gave me every assistance. A. W. F. STREET, LIEUT.-COLONEL, I. M. S., Acting Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay.

In accordance with Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, the report on vaccina- tion for 1899-1900 consists of brief notes and the usual statements. Vaccination in Native States. 2. By Government Resolutions in the General Department, Nos. 2803 and 4762, dated, respectively, 27th July and 18th Dec- ember 1894, the vaccination statistics of the following Native States are shown separately in Appendix II. Baroda. Káthiáwár. Cutch. Pálanpur. Cambay. Idar. 3. By Government Resolutions in the Political Department, Nos. 4516 and 2986, dated, respectively, 19th July 1897 and 20th May 1898, the Phaltan and the Bhor States are permitted to maintain a complete vaccination organization of their own. Discontinuance of Statis- tics on Army vaccination. 4. In accordance with the ruling in Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 4035, dated 13th September 1899, the information regarding vaccination in the Army are omitted from this report. The returns from the Army regarding vaccination are included in the Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, and any information required can be obtained from that report. Changes amongst the Super- vising officers. 5. The changes amongst the supervising officers which took place during 1899-1900 were as follow:2 Deputy Sanitary Commissioners ... ... ... 5 Superintendents of Vaccination ... ... ... 2 Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination ... ... 1 Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination ... ... 31 Clerks ... ... ... ... ... 15 Vaccinators3 Infants successfully vacci- nated as compared with available number. 9. The following table shows the number of infants successfully vacci- nated in the Presidency exclusive of Native States. The birth and death statistics are taken for the calen- dar year, as usual, in calculating the number avail- able for vaccination, because infants are generally not vaccinated until three months after birth:4 Number.

The subjoined table gives the rate of primary successful vaccination of children under one year and the total successful primary vaccinations per mille of population of each Collectorate and Native State (the vaccination work of which is under the supervision of the Sanitary Department as desired by Government in paragraph 4 of their Resolution in the General Department, No. 4748 of 4th December 1890) :5 Sex. 15. There were 348,621 males and 330,846 females primarily vaccinated and 63,349 males and 25,855 females re-vaccinated, the totals of persons operated on being 411,970 males and 356,701 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages were respectively 51.31 males and 48.69 females. In revaccination the percentages were respect- ively 70.92 and 29.08 and in total operations 53.50 and 46.40. Caste or Race. 16. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 4,665 Christians, 509,837 Hindus, 112,646 Mussalmans, 2,115 Pársis and 50,204 persons of other castes. Age. 17. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz. under 1 year between 1 and 6 years, and above 6 years. The num- bers under each period primarily vaccinated were 543, 712, 119, 737, and 16,018. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 509,251, of children between 1 and 6 years 108,851, and of persons of other ages 11,642. Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. 18. The following table shows the amount of inspection work done during the working season of the year 1899-1900 and the time spent in inspection in each Collectorate by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners as required by para- graph 5 of Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 2980 of 24th August 1893. It has already been explained that owing to the large area of the districts and the various duties connected with sanitary inspection of im- portant towns, it is impossible for the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to visit every táluka for thorough vaccination inspection oftener than once in two years, and in the Western, Central, and Southern Registration district full-time officers were not employed throughout the year: 6 Villages in British Territory.

In compliance with the instructions contained in letter from the Government of India, Home Department, Sanitary, No. 44 of 8th February 1894, printed in the preamble of Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 764 of 1st March 1894, there are two diagrams given, one to illustrate the average number of the population protected against small-pox and the mean death-rate from the disease per 10,000 of the population for the last ten years (1889-90 to 1898-99 inclusive), and the other to illustrate the same proportion for the year under report. As will be noticed there was a very heavy increase in the mortality from small-pox in Bombay City. The number of deaths during the year 1899-1900 amounted to 2,916 against 85 in the preceding year. The following table shows the number of deaths from this disease by months :Diagram Showing the average proportion of population protected, and the average death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population during the ten years 1889-90 to 1898-99 inclusive.

7 There is very little doubt that this epidemic was caused, as the Superintend- ent of Vaccination of the Presidency Circle states, by the large influx of immi- grants from famine-stricken districts, many probably from Native States, and imperfectly protected. The period at which the outbreak began coincides with the time when the pinch of famine began to be felt and the death-rate to rise in the famine-affected areas. It is satisfactory to note that the Department met the outbreak with ener- getic measures as the increase of 3,787 primary vaccinations and 31,363 re- vaccinations or a total increase of 35,150 operations over the numbers operated on in the previous year sufficiently testify. It was extremely fortunate that the calves were healthy and that the De- partment had some little time previously secured stables, which though far from perfect, were yet a great advance on the badly situated and badly ventilated stables previously occupied, and greatly contributed to the health of the animals. It is to be hoped that soon, with this epidemic in mind, a good central vaccine laboratory with proper scientific stabling for calves will be provided, one to which visitors to Bombay can be taken without fear of causing adverse remarks. The way in which the outbreak was met reflects the greatest credit on Ráo Bahádur Shantaram Vinayak Kantak, L.M. & S., the Superintendent, and those who worked under him. Expenditure. 22. The total expenditure on account of vaccination as compared with the preceding year is shown in the following state- ment :8 A few villages provided funds to furnish a calf every six months and some once a year; many other villages lend a calf for vaccination purposes. 27. In the Southern Registration District animal vaccination was con- tinued in Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli, Gadag-Betgeri, Byádgi, Ránebennur and Haveri municipal towns. In Savanúr lanoline vaccine lymph obtained from the Bangalore Animal Vaccination Depôt, was substituted for vaccination direct from the heifer. In the Kolhápur and Sángli Native States animal vaccination was also continued. 28. In the Gujarát Registration District, animal vaccination was continued in Ahmedabad City. 29. In the Sind Registration District animal vaccination was carried on in the town of Karáchi without any opposition throughout the year. Lymph. 30. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good. No con- signments of English lymph were received during the year. Lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. Inoculation. 31. No inoculation was reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency, except in the Kashmore Táluka, Sind District, and steps are being taken to prosecute the offender. No instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccination. Number of children success- fully vaccinated under one year of age in Municipal towns (vide Government Re- solution, General Department, No. 469, dated 23rd January 1900). 32. The following table is given for the first time, in compliance with Government of India, Home Department, No. 91 of 8th January 1900, showing the number of children available for vaccination in each Municipal town of the Bombay Presidency and the number of success- ful cases. It will be noticed that in many Municipal towns the numbers of infants under one year old are in excess of the numbers estimated to be available for vaccination. In those instances in which the excess is very marked, the increase is probably due to parents preferring animal vaccination. In Bombay City, of course, children are brought in who have not been born there. In some instances the vaccinators may have under-estimated the ages of the children brought for vaccination, for if they are brought in from outside there is no birth register to refer to. J. W.

In accordance with Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, brief notes on vacci- nation for the year 1900-1901 are submitted with the usual statements. Vaccination in Native States. 2. The vaccination statistics of Native States permitted by Government to maintain a complete vaccination organisation of their own are shown in Appendix II. Discontinuance of statistics on Army vaccination. 3. Statistics regarding vaccination in the Army are omitted. They are included in the Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India. Changes amongst the supervising officers. 4. The changes amongst the supervising officers, which took place during 1900-1901, were as follows:2 Sex. 9. There were 301,415 males and 285,063 females primarily vaccinated and 51,435 males and 22,408 females re-vaccinated, the total of persons operated on being 352,850 males and 307,471 females. In primary vaccination the sex percentages were respect- ively 51.39 males and 48.61 females. In re-vaccination the percentages were respectively 69.65 and 30.35 and in total operations 53.44 and 46.56. Caste or Race. 10. During the year there were primarily vaccinated 3,870 Christians, 428,935 Hindus, 101,952 Mussal- mans, 1,546 Parsis, and 50,175 persons of other castes. Age. 11. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years, and above six years. The numbers under each period primarily vaccinated were 439, 466, 126, 996, and 20,016. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was 405,823, of children between one and six years 112,654, and of persons of other ages 14,368. Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 12. The inspection work of vaccination was a good deal hampered by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners doing famine work, acting as District Medical officers and changes amongst them. In the Western Registration District the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected 14 tálukas and towns, inspected 6,484 vaccinated persons or 6.17 per cent. of those available, and travelled 2,137 miles. In the Central Registration District the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in- spected 31 tálukas and towns, inspected 2,706 vaccinated persons or 1.56 per cent. of those available, and travelled 4,657 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Southern Registration District, inspected 27 tálukas and towns, in- spected 3,943 vaccinated persons or 2.28 per cent. of those available, and travelled 3,773 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, inspected 15 tálukas and towns, inspected 2,089 vaccinated persons or 2.58 per cent. of those available, and travelled 2,783 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Sind Registration District, inspected 27 tálukas and towns, inspected 9,090 vaccinated persons or 8.98 per cent. of those available, and travelled 5,848 miles. The Diagrams showing the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination. 13. The diagrams showing &quot;population protected and the death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 of population for the year 1900-1901 &quot; and &quot; the average proportion of population protected and the average death-rate from small-pox per 10,000 for ten years &quot; are shown in the Appen- dices III and IV. Expenditure. 14. The total expenditure on account of vaccination as compared with the preceding year is shown in the following state- ment :3 Progress of animal vaccina- tion. 15. Animal vaccination was carried on in the following places of the Bombay Presidency during the year. 16. In the Western Registration District, vaccination with animal lymph was performed in 5 villages of the Khándesh and in 1 of the Násik, Thána and Kolába Collectorates. 17. In the City of Bombay vaccination with animal lymph exclusively was carried on throughout the year. To check the waste of animal lymph the Superintendent has used the lymph mixed with glycerine, as advocated by Dr. Copeman in a certain number of cases. He finds that the insertional success varies with the age of the emulsion used. The results are encouraging, but as yet the success is not equal to that obtained by using lymph direct from the calf. 18. In the Central Registration District animal vaccination was carried on throughout the year in the Poona City, Poona Cantonment and Kirkee Can- tonment, and in the towns of Ahmednagar, Sholápur and Sátára. Of the minor Municipalities, Junnar, Álandi, Jejuri, Sásvad, Sirúr, Talegaon Dábháda, Lonávla, Bárámati, Sangamner, Vámbori, Bhingár,. Karád, Wái, Rahimatpur, Mhasvad and Chiplun have provided sums for a calf every six months; the Bársi and Pandharpur Municipalities have provided a calf every four months. The practice of calf lymph has been introduced in the chief towns of Bhor, Phaltan, Aundh, and Akalkot Native States. 19. In the Southern Registration District animal vaccination was con- tinued in Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli and Gadag Towns and in the States of Kolhápur, Sángli and Savanúr. 20. In the Gujarát Registration District animal vaccination was carried on till October 1900, and it was then discontinued owing to heifers being not available. 21. In the Sind Registration District animal vaccination was carried on in the town of Karáchi, without any opposition, throughout the year. Lymph. 22. The quality of lymph in use throughout the year was good. No con- signments of English lymph were received during the year. Lymph is supplied to mofussil applicants by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the Superintendent of Vaccination, Presidency Circle, Bombay. No other lymph except animal and human was used in this Presidency during the year. The comparative results of the differ- ent kinds of lymph used are not shown this year as the Government Resolution was received towards the end of the year under report. 23. No inoculation was reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency except in the towns of Karáchi and Hyderabad. 24. No instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccination. 25. The table showing the number of children under one year of age in towns available for vaccination, &c., is put in as Appendix V. In the majority of towns, the numbers under one year vaccinated exceed the number available. Practically all the towns showing this excess are in famine-stricken districts and to large centres there was a large influx of people and the children they brought with them were vaccinated and a camp or poor-house in the neighbourhood of a town would increase the numbers operated upon. It is probable that all were not under one year of age, but as there were no registers from which the age could be judged, errors in this matter are excusable. J. W. CLARKSON, Lieut.-Colonel, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner for the Government of Bombay. Bombay, 23rd July 1901.
