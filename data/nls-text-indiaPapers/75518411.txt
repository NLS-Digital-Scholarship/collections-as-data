O. informed of the course of the disease and of the measures adopted for its suppression, and will also submit a fortnightly report (I. A. F. V- 1756) or oftener, if necessary, as directed in I. A. F. Z-2000. Report by civil authorities. 30. When a contagious or infectious disease appears among animals at a fair, or in the neighbourhood of a cantonment, or on a road used by troops the civil officer of the locality is enjoined to report the matter at once to the nearest military officer, who will inform any concerned, including S. V. O. Inspection of animals joining. 31. Horses joining a unit should not be admitted into the lines until passed by the officer in veterinary charge. Isolation, disinfection, etc. 32. Instructions regarding the isolation of animals shewing symptoms of any contagious or infectious disease, their destruction in order to prevent the spread of disease, the disinfection of stalls, stable appliances and gear, and attendants' clothing, and the disposal of carcasses of in- fected animals are laid down in A.

Destruction of animals, glanders- farcy. 34. Animals shewing clinical symptoms of glanders-farcy will be destroyed. In all outbreaks, or on the occurrence of suspicious cases, the mallein test will be applied. Animals re-acting to the test will be destroyed. Those shewing a doubtful re-action will be re-tested at inter- vals of not less than fourteen days, if facilities exist for isolation. Should any subsequent re-action be typical, the animal will be destroyed. Animals which on re-testing shew a diminished re-action will be continued in isolation until they either cease to re-act, when they may be considered safe and returned to their unit, or be destroyed if no change for the better in the re-action occurs. The result of all mallein tests will be reported to the S. V. O. Precaution after glanders. 35. A detachment cannot be considered free from glanders or farcy until all animals in contact have been tested with mallein, or until four months have elapsed since the last animal was destroyed.
