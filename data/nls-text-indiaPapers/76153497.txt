I also held charge of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, during the Superintendent's absence on leave; from 26th August to 25th October, and again from 28th November (afternoon) to 19th December. Mr. P. J. Kerr, i.c.v.d., arrived here from England on the 22nd January and was placed in training under me till 2nd November, when he left this for further training in the Central Provinces. Mr. Kerr is an officer of considerable promise. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 2.

The price of the serum realised amounted to Rs. 658-11 which was credited to Government. 5. Foot-and-Mouth disease appeared in several parts of Calcutta, and amongst the cattle belonging to the Garden Reach Municipality and the bullocks in the Transport Lines at Hastings. 6. About 1,670 cattle-byres and 24,930 cattle were inspected by my officers. 7. Fifty-seven calves were tested with tuberculin at the instance of the Health Officer of the Corporation of Calcutta at the Animal Vaccine Dep6t, to ascertain their fitness for the preparation of lymph. In the Presidency Jail ten cattle were tested with tuberculin. 8. Eighty cases of suspected Rabies from Calcutta and elsewhere were examined, of which 73 proved to be suffering from the disease. 9. While the Presidency Remount Dep6t at Garden Reach was closed from April to October, 2,014 horses, 59 cattle and 12 dogs prior to landing were inspected by my staff on board the ships at the Port of: Calcutta.

Greater interest is however being taken in reporting both by members of the Agricultural Associations and by private people. Equines. 6. Glanders.( 3 ) inoculation was undertaken and 73 died amongst the inoculated. The largest number of inoculation were made in Tangail, Jalpaiguri and Gaibandha. The recent orders to charge annas 2 for each dose of serum will, it may reason- ably be feared, seriously affect the numbers of inoculations in future. 17. Anthrax.( 4 ) 27.

Dinajpur Veterinary Hospital.( 6 ) at Comilla, Noakhali and Chittagong thrice, the work of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant at Chittagong and Comilla twice, and Barisal, Faridpur, Narayanganj, Netrakona and Kishorganj once each. Besides his ordinary duties this Inspector was engaged in an investigation into the practices carried out by godagas in the interior of Tippera and Mymen- singh. He also inspected the breeding hulls at Noakhali, Barisal and other places during his inspection in the districts. (2) Inspector M. S. Choivdhuri was in charge of Rajshahi Division throughout the year, with the exception of two months and 20 days when he was under training at the post-graduate class in the Bengal Veterinary College. During his absence Staff Assistant M. P. Ghosh hold charge of the Division. Mr. Chowdhuri was on tour for 118 days, and travelled 5,518 miles by rail, 328 miles by steamer and country-boats and 596 miles by road. He inspected the dispensaries and the work of the Veterinary Assistants at Malda, Nator and Rajshahi thrice, and Jalpaiguri, Bangpur, Bogra, Pabna, Gaibandha, Serajganj and Dinajpur twice. He also inspected the stud-bulls during his inspection of the districts. He attended three outbreaks of Glanders at Rajshahi and Nator as an Inspector under the Act. At Rajshahi and Nator 12 cases were detected and destroyed. At Malda a suspected animal was tested with Mallein, but it did not re-act and was discharged. (3) Mr. P. N. Dass was in charge of the Presidency Division through- out the year, and inspected the work of all the assistants in his circle. He attended several outbreaks of Glanders in the districts of Jessore, Murshidabad and Burdwan. and conducted his work successfully. He has been transferred to Bihar from 1st April 1912. (4) Mr. S. N. Dutt was in charge of the Municipalities in the vicinity of Calcutta and suburbs. He regularly inspected all the Municipal animals as well as the cattle sheds and byres. He also helped the several Municipal authorities in his juris- diction in granting licenses to the hack-owners. He was then placed in charge of the Burdwan Division from 1st April 1912. (5) Mr. K. C. Pramanick was in charge of the Burdwan Division. He was sent in November 1911 to the Bengal Veterinary College to undergo a post-graduate course ; but in the examination he failed to show that he possessed sufficient knowledge in general subjects and was therefore reduced to the grade of a Veterinary Assistant. 46.

This falling off in number was very largely due to a large decrease in the number of out-patients treated in the Dacca Dispensary. It is explained that this large decrease is due to the fact that a much smaller number of animals were seized under the Cruelty Act. This result cannot be regarded as satisfactory, and steps will be taken to bring the matter to the notice of trying courts in Dacca. 8. Breeding operations.REVENUE DEPARTMENT. AGRICULTURE. DARJEELING, THE 10TH OCTOBER 1912. RESOLUTION( 2 ) inoculated against this disease which causes heavy loss to cultivators through- out the Province. His Excellency in Council considers that the education of the raiyat to a proper understanding of the value of inoculation is a matter of prime importance, and he would impress on the officers of the Depart- ment the desirability of utilizing every opportunity for explanation and demonstration of the benefits of this operation when touring in the mufassal. 5. The itinerant veterinary assistants visited 8,055 villages as against 7.103 in the previous year. Outbreaks of diseases are being reported more frequently than in the past, and it is gratifying to observe that much greater interest is now being taken in this matter both by members of the Agricultural Associations and by private persons. The arrangements for notifying casualties still, however, leave much to be desired. The village panchayats have not yet realized the importance of their duties in this respect and steps should be taken to impress upon the Presidents and Collecting Members of these bodies the necessity for prompt action. The speedy arrival of a veterinary officer at the scene of an outbreak of disease may be the means of saving the villagers from heavy pecuniary loss, as the statistics show that inoculated animals survive the epidemic in all but an infinitesimal number of cases. His Excellency in Council desires, therefore to repeat the injunction given to the veterinary assistants in the Resolution of the late Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam for the year 1910-11 to the effect that they should lose no opportunity of impressing on the people the necessity for reporting even sporadic cases of: disease at the time of occurrence. 6. In Calcutta and its neighbourhood 3,800 stables were inspected, of which only 15 were found to be infected with glanders, as compared with 34 in the previous year. The Governor in Council notices with regret the complaint made by the Superintendent. Civil Veterinary Department, that certain municipalities adopted an obstructive attitude towards the officers entrusted with the administration of the Glanders and Farcy Act. An enquiry will be made into the matter. Although contagious equine diseases are not of such serious importance as bovine diseases in this Presidency, the figures show that the Department does not neglect this branch of veterinary work. The system of granting compensation to the owners of animals des- troyed has greatly facilitated the stamping out of disease. 7. It is reported that in certain districts the existing staff of veterinary assistants has been found to be insufficient to cope satisfactorily with out- breaks which occur in remote parts of the mufassal. The proposal to increase the number of veterinary assistants in the near future will be carefully examined. 8. The important question of improving the breed of cattle has been engaging the attention of Government for some time. The demand for bulls for breeding purposes is on the increase, but the indigenous stock is poor and fodder is often deficient. The complaint that no attempt is made to select the best cows for breeding and that immature bulls are allowed to cover the herd is general and well-founded, but no efficient remedies for such difficulties have been found during the past 15 years. If suitable bulls can be obtained in local cattle fairs, as is suggested by the Director of Agriculture, every endeavour should be made to prevent their being castrated and to promote their distribution for breeding purposes throughout the country. The Gover- nor in Council is confident that the Director of Agriculture will give to this important matter the careful consideration which it demands, and he will be prepared to support any suitable scheme for encouraging the improvement of the livestock of the country by means of the selection of the best animals for breeding purposes that the Director after full enquiry may be prepared to recommend. 9. Measures were adopted during the year to carry out a survey and census of cattle in the Province. The Director of Agriculture's report on the subject has not yet been submitted to Government. 10. There has been a striking falling off in the number of animals sent for treatment under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act both in Calcutta and in the mufassal. Only 148 animals were sent for treatment to the Veteri- nary College Hospital, although the number of prosecutions was 11,330. It
( 3 ) seems probable that the owners of disabled animals pay the fines and imme- diately put the animals in use again without first placing them under proper treatment. The attention of the trying Magistrates will be drawn to the desirability of sending all disabled and diseased animals to hospital. The Corporation of Calcutta have now appointed their own veterinary officer and have not sent many cases to the Veterinary College. It is, however, gratify- ing to notice that the decrease in the Corporation cases has not prevented a steady increase in the number of cases treated by the college staff. 11. It is reported that many veterinary dispensaries, such as those at Bakarganj, Noakhali, Bogra and Pabna, have no accommodation for in- patients, while at Dacca only municipal bullocks are provided for. Great importance is attached to this branch of veterinary work, and if the Depart- ment is to become as successful as the value of its work demands, steps should be taken to remedy this defect. There was a decrease of 3,004 in the number of cases treated at the veterinary dispensaries. There was a falling off in the number of patients at the Dacca Dispensary owing to fewer seizures under the Cruelty Act, but the general health of the year has been good, and the decrease in epizootic diseases is sufficient to explain the general diminution in the number of patients. 12. Colonel Raymond, C.I.E., retired from the service of Government after the close of the year, and the Governor in Council in a valedictory notice placed on record his high appreciation of the value of the services rendered by him to the cause of veterinary science and to the cultivators of Bengal during a period of more than 15 years. The reports reviewed above form a fresh testimony to the ability and experience with which Colonel Raymond carried out the duties entrusted to him. By order of the Governor in Council, J. H. KERR.
