No. C-127. CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Medical Department. FROM LIEUT.-COL. R. P. COLOMB, I. A., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Pachmarhi, the 30th April 1911. SIR, I am directed to submit herewith three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum at Nagpur for the year 1910, and to say that the work will be reviewed when the Triennial Report for the year 1911 is dealt with. 2. A considerable portion of the note is devoted to the high mortality which prevailed in the Asylum during the year, and this mortality calls for explanation. When the abnormal death-rate was beyond doubt, the Superintendent of the Asylum made a careful examination, and, as a result, discovered the presence of the Ankylostoma worm. The temporary employment of Major Kenrick, I. M. S., who was then engaged in the investigation of malaria in the Provinces, has been related in the notes : his report showed that considerably more than 15 per cent of the inmates were infected with the worm. The investigations of Colonel Banatvala have elicited some very interesting facts, tending to show that it is at present premature to assume that the presence of the Ankylostoma worm in the intestines of a large number of the inmates of the Asylum has any direct connection with the high mortality. Colonel Banatvala has been enquiring into the question of how far the worm may exist among the comparatively healthy people in this part of India. For this purpose he has been examining the fæces of a large number of prisoners in the Central Jail at Nagpur, and the results go to show that the Ankylostoma worm does exist in a large proportion of the healthy prisoners, and that it is specially common among new admissions. 3. There is, however, said to be considerable difference of opinion among medical men regarding the harmfulness of the worm in the intestines of man, but the consensus of opinion is declared to be that, except when the worm is present in very large numbers, it has little or no effect on the general health of human beings. The investigations are proceeding, and a report by Colonel Banatvala will shortly be submitted to the Administration.
2 4. Structural and executive defects in the Asylum, which had not hitherto attracted attention, have now been brought to notice as one of the results of the investigations, and proposals are under consideration involving considerable improvements in many directions, extending to new construction, a large staff of sweepers, and the alteration of much of the drainage system. 5. The latest reports from the Asylum show a markedly improved health bill and a generally rising weight among the inmates. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. P. COLOMB, Second Secretary. Govt. Press, Nagpur:(1) In line 22 on the first page of the Brief notes against side heads "Criminal Lunatics " for " 94 " read " 70 ".
BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1910. In 1907 all the females had been transferred from the Jubbulpore Asylum to the Nagpur Asylum, and on the 1st March 1910 all the males were transferred from Jubbulpore, so that there is now only one Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces. Statement I. This statement shows the admissions during the year 1910 as well as the admissions in the two previous years. On the 1st March 106 lunatics were transferred from Jubbulpore. The total number of admissions and re-admissions during the year was 74 males and 14 females. The total population was 396, which was the same as in 1909 and 5 more than in 1908. The number discharged was 46 males and 11 females. The total number of deaths was 80. One of these took place at Jubbulpore and 79 in the Nagpur Asylum. This high mortality was due largely to ankylostomiasis and will be referred to later. The accommodation in the asylum at 54 superficial feet per inmate is for males 273 and for females 126. The largest numbers confined on one day were 238 males and 73 females, so that there has not been any overcrowding. Statement II. Criminal Lunatics.2 amalgamation of the two asylums, the figures for the past three years may be examined in more detail than is usual in the annual notes:3 Lieutenant-Colonel Banatvala examined 142 and found that 102 or 72 per cent had intestinal parasites of some sort: 59 had one variety : 31 had two : 8 had three : and 4 had four varieties of intestinal parasites.

No.934/VI-10-3. CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Education and Medical department. Nagpur, the 4th May 1912. READ2 Nevertheless the concentration of the whole of the lunatics of the Province in a single institution must remain only a half measure of reform until it is com- pleted by the appointment of an expert alienist for their study, care, and control, and this appointment must be made as soon as a suitable officer is available. 3. As compared with the preceding triennium the number of admissions into the asylum rose from 215 to 277. The agricultural seasons have been prosperous; the increase cannot therefore be attributed to bad harvests ; and until the figures of the Census of 1911 are available in detail the Chief Com- missioner considers that it would be idle to speculate whether there has been a real increase in mental diseases. It seems probable that the larger number of admissions into the asylum may be attributed to greater confidence in this institution; this view is supported by the increase in the number of paying patients. It is also satisfactory to note that of the 164 discharges no fewer than 116 were released as cured, while the condition of 35 others was certified to have improved. 4. The amalgamation of the Jubbulpore and Nagpur Asylums has made for economy. In spite of the high prices of foodstuffs and of additions to the diet of the inmates, the maintenance charges which amounted to Rs. 36,219 in 1908 fell to Rs. 34,890 in 1911. The receipts from paying patients also show an improvement; and indicate that steps are being taken to secure payment for the maintenance of lunatics who have relatives in easy circum- stances. 5. The progress made during the period under review has been satisfac- tory and the Chief Commissioner desires to acknowledge his obligations to Lieutenant-Colonel Buchanan and the Deputy Superintendent of the Asylum, Mr. Kashinath Gopal, for the good work they have done. Mr. Fox-Strangways' special thanks are due to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospita's for the interest displayed by him in the asylum and to Major Kenrick and Lt.-Colonel Banatvala for the thoroughness with which they carried out the special investi- gations of the causes of the high mortality in 1910.

Sickness and mortality3 There are two methods of examination4 Among the many improvements and changes in the management of the insanes I might mention the following :5 Statement III. 7. Religion and sex of those admitted.6 The expenditure under contingencies has gone up to (in hundreds) 30, 42, 50 ::65, 59, 85, the increase in 1911 being due to the purchase of furniture for the laboratory, iron cots for the hospital, iron receptacles, uniform for warders, a typewriter, etc. Statement IX. 13. Establishment.7 Gopal at Nagpur gave much attention to the general tidying up of the asylum, to the farm work, for which he has special qualifications, and to the general supervision of the inmates. Sub-Assistant Surgeon D. V. Pradhan, who has considerable skill in the use of the microscope, gave most valuable help in examining the stools of the inmates and in supervising the treatment for various kinds of parasitic infection. He is said to be an exceptionally smart young Sub-Assistant Surgeon and has worked with great diligence throughout the year. The second Sub-Assistant Surgeon, C. R. Pangarkar, who has been appointed to the asylum since July 1911, has given most valuable help in attending to the treatment of the large numbers who were admitted in hospital. The Head Clerk, Narayan Madho, has to deal with large amounts of money, and he has kept the numerous and complicated accounts of the asylum very creditably. The rest of the staff have worked satisfactorily. G. W. P. DENNYS, COL., I. M. S., NAGPUR: Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, The 26th February 1912. Central Provinces.

No. 576/VI-32-2 CENTRAL PROVINCES ADMINISTRATION. Medical Department. FROM SIR ARTHUR BLENNERHASSETT, BART., I. C. S., THIRD SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 16th April 1913. SIR, I am directed to submit herewith three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces for the year 1912 and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1914 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. BLENNERHASSETT, Third Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces. Govt. Press, Nagpur :BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1912. STATEMENT I. Admissions. The year opened with 286 lunatics under confinement, viz., 230 males and 56 females. There were 74 admissions including one re-admission (57 males and 17 females) against 94 in the previous year. Of the 74 admissions, 14 were criminal lunatics and the rest non-criminal lunatics. The Nagpur district furnished the largest number (28) of the admissions. The total number in the Asylum at the end of the year was 280 of which 76 are criminal lunatics. Discharges. 2. The number discharged from the Asylum was 51 as compared with 52 in the previous year. 44 were discharged after recovery against 39 in 1911. The number of males discharged after recovery was 38 against 33 in 1911, and among the females the number was 6 for this year and the previous year. Sickness and mortality. 3. There is no separate statement to show the hospital figures, but the Superintendent has furnished some of the principal details. 169 lunatics were in hospital during the year, of these 29, were discharged as cured, 104 were transferred to the infirm gang, 29 died, leaving a balance of 7 at the end of the year The 29 deaths were from dysentery (5), pulmonary tuberculosis (2), intestinal obstruction (1), valvue lar disease of the heart (4), old age and general debility (6), asphyxia due to epilepsy (5), exhaustion due to mania (3) and anorexia due to melancholia (3). 4. In the reports for 1910 and 1911 attention was drawn to the high mor- tality supposed to be due to intestinal worms. The stools of the inmates were examined twice during the year and a number of special gangs were formed so that frequent inspections could be made of those who were infected. The ova of the ankylostoma worm were found in 67 cases, but it is remarkable that although the stools were sifted as described in last year's report, no ankylostoma worms were found during the year. The ova of the trichocephalus (whip) worms were found in 39 cases, and although various kinds of treatment were tried, no worms of this description could be found. 35 cases had the ascarides (round) worms. Women suffered more from the last two diseases than men as 50 females were treated against 24 males. 5. Attention was also drawn last year to the number that were infected with more than one parasite and the following table shows the numbers for the past two years :2 6. The ratio of deaths per cent of average strength amongst the inmates of the Asylums in the different Provinces of India in 1912 as compared with that in these Provinces, were :3 as owing to the failure of the farm produce local purchases of fodder had to be made at higher rates and (6) the pay of the sweepers being charged to Contingencies. The average cost per lunatic was Rs. 162-9-11 against Rs. 133-5-8 in 1911. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, it was Rs. 138-3-10 against Rs. 120-12-2 in 1911. Excluding the receipts from paying patients which are credited to Government, the cost per head was Rs. 148-12-5 against Rs. 122-15-11 in 1911. The amount realised from paying patients was Rs. 4,984-14-6 against Rs. 3,656-7-0 in the previous year. The increase is due to the admission of four well-to-do patients who pay at a higher rate. STATEMENT IX. Staff. 14. There has been no change in the establishment. The Superintendent reports in favourable terms of the work done by the subordinate staff. The Deputy Superintendent continues to work well and is highly spoken of by the Superintendent for his tact in managing the lunatics. STATEMENT X. Manufactures., &c. 15. The manufacturing department yielded a net profit of Rs. 3,097-13-3 against Rs. 2,517-14-11 in the previous year. 91.50 per cent of the lunatics are now employed on various indus- tries, and to encourage them to work monetary rewards are given. General remarks. 16. During the year under report draft rules under the new Lunacy Act have been framed and submitted to the Local Adminis- tration for approval. These rules are still under con- sideration, but it is expected that final orders will be issued shortly. Arrangements have been made to establish a Central Vaccine Lymph Depôt for the Central Provinces. As there is a large Dairy Farm at the Asylum, it has been proposed to attach this Depôt to the Asylum. The necessary apparatus is at present on its way out from England, and it is hoped the Lymph Depôt will be in full working order under the Sanitary Commissioner shortly. A Military Assistant Surgeon, with special Laboratory experience, has been selected as Superintendent of the Lymph Depôt and proposals are under consideration to amalgamate this Depôt with a Provincial Bacteriological Laboratory, the want of which has been much felt in these Provinces lately. It is hoped that this Bacteriological Laboratory will be in working order in the course of the next year. The question of the appointment of a whole-time Alienist Specialist to the charge of this Central Asylum has once more come to the fore. Owing to the fact that it is hoped to open the new Medical School at Nagpur next autumn, it will be necessary to relieve the Civil Surgeon of the charge of the Asylum, as it would be impossible for him to do justice to the work in addition to that of Superintendent of the School. Application has been made to the Local Admin- istration for the services of a whole-time I. M. S. Officer as an Alienist Specialist, and it is hoped that the Secretary of State will be pleased to sanction the appointment. The Director-General of the I. M. S. inspected the Lunatic Asylum at Nagpur recently, and was satisfied that the institution offered sufficient justifi- cation for the appointment of a whole-time Specialist, NAGPUR: G. W. P.

No. 405/VI-32-2. Central Provinces Administration MEDICAL DEPARTMENT FROM J. T. MARTEN, ESQ., I. C. S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 11th April 1914. SIR, I am directed to submit, herewith, three copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces for the year 1913, and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year ending 1914 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. T. MARTEN, Second Secretary. Govt. Press, Nagpur:BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1913. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Buchanan, I. M. S., held charge of the Asylum for the greater part of the year under report. He made over charge to Major P. F. Chapman, I. M. S., on the afternoon of the 4th October 1913. STATEMENT I. Admissions. 2. The year opened with 280 lunatics under confinement, viz., 219 males and 61 females. There were 91 admissions including 2 readmissions (73 males and 18 females) against 74 in 1912. Of the 91 admissions, 14 were criminal and the rest non-criminal lunatics. The Nagpur District furnished the largest number (41) of the admissions. The total number in the Asylum at the close of the year was 310, of which 80 are criminal lunatics against 280 and 76 last year. Discharges. 3. Forty-one lunatics were discharged against 51 in the previous year. 31 were discharged as cured, 8 improved and 2 discharged as otherwise, against 44, 6 and 1 respectively in the past year. Out of the 31 discharged as cured, 3 were females. Sickness and mortality. 4. Ninty-two lunatics were admitted into the hospital (67 males and 25 females) ; of these 22 were discharged as cured, 50 transferred to the infirm gang and 20 died, leaving no balance at the close of the year. Of the 20 deaths 3 were lunatics who were admitted 20 days before their death in a dying condition. The deaths were from dysentery (5), exhaustion due to acute mania (3), asphyxia due to epilepsy (2), pulmonary tuberculosis (1), double pneumonia (1), diabetes (1), rheumatism (1), secondary post-partem hæmorrhage (1), old age and general debility (1), and anorexia due to acute mania and melancholia (4). 5. In the previous reports attention was drawn to the prevalence of intestinal worms among the Asylum inmates. The stools of all the inmates were examined twice during the year. The number of worms found among the male inmates were 41 ankylostoma (in 19 patients), 5 trichocephalus (in 3 patients), and 6 cestodes in segments (in 6 patients). Among females none of these worms were found. At the close of the year the number of lunatics remaining in infected gangs were : ankylostoma 18, trichocephalus 32, ascaris 4, against 46, 39 and 35, respectively, in the previous year. No round worms were found amongst males, but among females 7 were found. 6. The number of multiple infection as compared with the past two years was:2 Among the new admissions ankylostoma infection was found in 19 lunatics received from Nagpur, Saugor, Akola, Gwalior, Raipur, Betul, Bilaspur, Buldana and Hoshangabad. The percentage of infection in new admissions was 20.88 against 21.62 in the past year. Special treatment for intestinal parasitic diseases, and the weekly administration of quinine to all the patients during the rains and fortnightly in other seasons, was carried on as usual. 7. The ratio of deaths per cent of average strength amongst the inmates of the Asylums in the various Provinces of India in 1913 was as follows : 3 STATEMENT VIII. Finance. 13. The total amount spent for the upkeep of the Asylum was Rs. 84,975 against Rs. 58,544 in the previous year. The increase is principally due to (1) structural improvements, (2) higher rates paid on food-grains, sheep and cattle fodder, (3) purchase of a sewing machine, iron receptacles and firewood, (4) increased water-rate on account of water used for flushing wards, etc. The average cost per lunatic was Rs. 229-0-8 against Rs. 162-9-11 in 1912. Excluding the Public Works Department charges, it was Rs. 133-12-8 against Rs. 138-3-10 in 1912. Excluding the receipts from paying patients, which are credited to Government, the cost per head was Rs. 218-14-6 against Rs. 148-12-5 in 1912. The amount realised from paying patients was Rs. 3,759-13-11 against Rs. 4,984-14-6 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the discharge of three well-to-do patients during the year. STATEMENT IX. Staff. 14. There has been no change in the establishment sanctioned, but a scheme has recently been submitted by the Superin- tendent for improving the pay and prospects of the Asylum staff which is under consideration. The Superintendent reports favourably on the work done by his subordinate staff. The Deputy Superin- tendent, Kashinath Gopal Paonaskar, has maintained his reputation of being capable, intelligent, hardworking and tactful in dealing both with the staff and lunatics. STATEMENT X. Manufactures, &c. 15. The manufacturing department yielded a net profit of Rs. 2,591 against Rs. 3,098 in the past year. The decrease is due to 74 old and useless cattle having been auctioned during the year, and thus reducing the outturn of milk in the dairy. 89.17 per cent of the lunatics are employed on various industries in the Asylum. General remarks. 16. The rules under the new Lunacy Act have recently been published by the Local Administration. G. W. P. DENNYS, COL., I. M.

No. 479/VI-32-2. Central Provinces Administration MEDICAL DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 8th May 1915. READ- The Triennial Report and Statements of the Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces for the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. RESOLUTION. The outstanding feature of the triennium has been the completion, at a cost of Rs. 50,043, of most of the structural alterations in the Asylum proposed by the Visitors on the strength of the report made by Lt.-Colonel Banatwala, I.M.S., on the high mortality of the year 1910. 2. There is now accommodation for 400 patients : but the buildings are still insufficient to provide for probable expansion in the number of inmates and staff, and further works, estimated to cost Rs. 33,800, including the provision of isolation for infectious patients, will be undertaken as soon as funds are available. 3. Admissions have shown a steady tendency to increase. The total number was 285, or 8 more than in the preceding triennium: but, taken by years, the figures are 74 in 1912, 91 in 1913, and 120 in 1914. This does not neces- sarily, in the Chief Commissioner's opinion, indicate any general increase in mental disease: the trifling increase per mille in the ratio of insanes to total population from .11 in 1901 to .15 in 1911 may well be due to accidental causes or to differences of classification at census. The increasing admissions are doubtless in part due to the comparatively poor seasons of the past three years : but Sir Benjamin Robertson believes that in the main they reflect increasing public confidence in the institution, a theory borne out by the increase in the number of private paying patients. 4. The Chief Commissioner is gratified to note the obvious and complete success which has attended the attempt to grapple with the problem of the once high mortality in this Asylum. The number of deaths was little more than half the figure of the previous triennium ; admissions to hospital, in spite of a larger average population, fell by 19 per cent : and the death-rate during the triennium shows a satisfactory decline from 102 per mille in 1912 to 67 in 1913 and 61 in 1914. The last figure is one of the lowest death-rates in any Asylum in India, and compares favourably with the death-rate of 55 per mille in 1911, when the high rate of 166, which had prevailed during the five previous years, had removed all the weakest patients. 5. Sir Benjamin Robertson fully concurs in the view expressed by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals as to the necessity for greater care and trouble on the part of confining Magistrates and Police in the preparation of history sheets. It is imperative for the proper treatment and classification of insanity that the fullest information obtainable should be supplied : and the Chief Commissioner desires that Magistrates and Police, to whom special instructions will shortly issue, should give this matter their careful attention.
2 6 There has been a considerable increase in maintenance charges : but this is largely due to the increased price of foodstuffs combined with greater liberality in diet and clothing as a result of the enquiry of 1910, and Sir Benjamin Robertson is satisfied that the Asylum is run as economically as is consistent with efficiency. 7. The question of appointing an expert alienist as Superintendent, touched upon in the Resolution on the last Triennial Report, still remains to be settled. For the moment it must naturally be in abeyance owing to the temporary deple- tion of the ranks of the Indian Medical Service : but the proposal has been sympathetically received by the Government of India, and certain suggestions which they have made for providing a whole-time expert with adequate work are now engaging the Chief Commissioner's attention. 8. The thanks of the Administration are due to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals for his careful supervision of the work of the Asylum during the triennium: and the Chief Commissioner also desires to acknowledge his obligations to Lt.-Colonel Buchanan, I.M.S., Major Chapman, I.M.S., and the other officers mentioned by the Inspector-General, for the good work done by them in connection with the Asylum.

Officers-in-charge. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Buchanan, I.M.S., was in charge from 1st January 1912 to 4th October 1913 when he was relieved by Major P. F. Chapman, I.M.S., who remained in charge to the end of the period under report. STATEMENT I. Accommodation and popula- tion. 2. The accommodation which was for 399 (273 males and 126 females) at the close of the last triennium was raised to 400, i. c., by one on the male side, which was provided for when the remodelling of Ward No. I was completed during the year 1914. At the close of 1914 there were 290 males and 84 females in the Asylum. There was slight overcrowding on the male side during the year 1914 if judged from the number of inmates in the Asylum, but a greater number of inmates than the capacity of each ward provided were never locked up. This was due to not locking up the recovered non-criminal and criminal lunatics in the latter half of the period of their discharge. They numbered about 20. These were kept out in the verandah of the wards along with the warders, as has been usual for the past 8 years, to help in night rounds. The largest number present on any one night during the last three years was: 2 those of the old inmates was also carried out during each of the three years under report with the following results as compared with the year 1911 :3 (6) Slaughter house. (7) Patent stone flooring to the old wards and courtyards of solitary cells and latrines of new barracks. (8) New kitchen. (9) Improvements to cattle shed. (10) Platform and drain to cattle tank. (11) Improvements to calf shed. Third set. (12) Barrack for 16 cheap and four better class paying patients. (13) Platform for dairy. (14) Special repairs to Deputy Superintendent's quarters. Fourth set. (15) Dutch barn for fodder. (16) Fencing (Hospital, Deputy Superintendent's and Matron's quarters). (17) Dismantling godown and male latrines in ward No. 2. (18) Grain godown. The project was taken in hand by the Public Works Department during 1912 before the preparation of Stage III plans and estimates. Certain works were completed and others were in progress in 1913. The whole project was completed in 1914 at a cost of Rs. 50,043 which was Rs. 4,902 less than the original estimate. Besides the above works, the following works were sanctioned from the minor works grant of this Department to be undertaken at the estimated cost and in years noted against each :4 STATEMENT III. Religion and sex of those admitted. 7. Hindus formed 80.35 per cent of the total admissions during the triennium. Muhammadans gave 14.74, and Indian Chris- tians and other castes contributed 4.21 and 0.70, respec- tively. The percentage of male and female admissions to the total admitted was 78.95 and 21.05, respectively, against 83.75 males and 16.25 females in the preceding triennium. STATEMENT IV. Occupation. 8. In the previous triennium as well as in this, beggars, labourers, cultiva- tors and servants furnished the largest number of admissions. The number whose occupation could not be traced was three (in 1914 only) against 4 in the previous three years, viz., 3 in 1909 and 1 in 1910. STATEMENT V. Age on admission. 9. In this triennium also the majority of the admissions were between the ages of 20 to 40. As expressed previously, this is the period of greatest stress and pressure, and the Super- intendent remarks that it is also the period when the sexual life is most active. This is the period in which hereditary weaknesses and defects and injuries to the cerebral functions are most likely to develop. STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. 10. This statement deals with all the inmates of the Asylum. During the course of the triennium a new form was introduced and the classification of all the inmates has been revised in accordance with the instructions issued by the Government of India. As is usual, mania, under its various sub-heads, heads the list as the type most frequently present in those admitted to the Asylum, this type existing in 61.40 per cent of admissions in the triennium. Melancholia comes next with 18.95, then dementia with 6.67 per cent. Of those cured and improved, maniacs formed 72.95 per cent, melancholics 14.75, and idiots and dements each 82. STATEMENT VII. Ætiological factors and associated conditions. 11. This statement has also been revised and considerably altered in the course of the triennium. The difficulty in grouping the cases pointed out in 1912 still exists. The principal predisposing and exciting causes of those admitted during the triennium were :5 The cost of diet has been (in hundreds) 168, 125, 137 : : 155, 165, 196. The increase in 1913 and 1914 was due to a large number of admissions and to the higher rates paid for food grain. The cost of clothing and bedding has run up considerably (in hundreds) 6, 10, 12 : : 17, 19, 23 and was due to the purchase of a liberal supply of warm clothing. The expenditure under contingencies has been considerably increased (in hundreds) 65, 59, 85 : : 105, 90, 115. The increase in this triennium was due to (1) enhanced cost of the feed of the dairy cattle, (2) pay of sweepers being charged to contingencies, (3) purchase of a cycle, books, office furniture, sewing machine, fire engine and hose and iron receptacles, (4) increased water-rate on account of water used for flushing wards, etc., (5) telephone charges, and (6) pay of servants of paying patients. There is likelihood of the charges under water- rate being reduced, when the proposed locking arrangements for flushing pipes are carried out by the Public Works Department. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 13. There has been no change in the establishment sanctioned, but the difficulty in filling up vacancies caused by the resignation or otherwise amongst the warders and other servants of the Asylum by suitable persons still exists. It is hoped that there will be no cause for complaint when the scheme, which has been submitted for improving the pay and prospects of the Asylum staff, has been finally sanctioned by the Local Administration. STATEMENT X. Profit and loss. 14. The profits during the triennium have been Rs. 9,375 against Rs. 9,297 in the previous triennium. General remarks. 15. The draft rules, which were framed under the new Lunacy Act, were finally approved by the Local Administration in 1914 and are now in force. A form of the monthly return of sick to be submitted to my office by the Superintendent of the Asylum has been prescribed and approved by the Local Administration. Prophylactics. 16. Quinine was given to lunatics from July to November with the result of diminishing fever as usual: vegetables and fruits grown in the Asylum gardens were freely used. Employment. 17. The chief occupation of the male lunatics is employment on the farm dairy and garden and general cleaning. A few are employed in cooking, weaving, smith and carpentry shops. The females are employed in cleaning grain, gardening and general cleaning in their wards. Amusements. 18. Gramophone entertainments were given to the lunatics every week and on festivals. Rewards. 19. The system of giving small money rewards to hard-working and deserving well-behaved lunatics continues and is ap- preciated, the money being generally spent in buying sweets, books and choice clothing. Meetings of Official Visitors. 20. The Official Visitors held their meetings regularly throughout the period under report and have maintained the usual interest in the management of the Asylum. Notice of officers. 21. I wish to specially bring to the notice of the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner the good work done at this Asylum by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Buchanan, I.M.S., and Major P. F. Chapman, I.M.S, during the periods in the triennium each held the appointment of Superintendent. The mortality, which had in 1910 been appall- ingly heavy, has, by dint of great attention to detail and most careful supervision on the part of these officers, been reduced during the triennium to a most
6 satisfactory figure, which compares favourably with that of any other Lunatic Asylum in India. This is specially creditable, considering the very heavy work and the multifarious duties that have to be performed by the Civil Surgeon of Nagpur, who holds the appointment of Superintendent of the Asylum as an additional charge. The question of the appointment of a whole-time Alienist Specialist to this Asylum has had to be postponed indefinitely owing to the outbreak of war and the reversion of large numbers of Indian Medical Service Officers in Civil employment to Military duty. The matter has been represented to the Government of India, who have expressed their sympathy with the proposal. They have made certain suggestions whereby certain extra duties might be imposed on the whole-time Superintendent. These suggestions are now under consideration. It is probable that when the time comes for the appointment of an Alienist Specialist to this Asylum it will be possible to delegate to him certain duties in connection with the Robertson Medical School at Nagpur and so provide him with sufficient work, which the comparatively small size of the Asylum by itself might not have been able to do. Deputy Superintendent Kashinath Gopal has performed his duties most satisfactorily. His general management, his care and solicitude for, and his tact in dealing with, the inmates and his discipline with the staff have all been excellent, and I believe that it is largely due to his unremitting zeal that the good health and the low mortality of the Asylum are to be attributed. Sub-Assistant Surgeon D. V. Pradhan has done his work well and given thorough satisfaction. The second Sub-Assistant Surgeon C. R. Pangarkar has done specially good work. He is said to be willing and a conscientious Sub-Assistant Surgeon and is always ready to take more than his share of the work. The very small number of audit objections is attributed to the careful work of the Head Clerk Narain Mahdo, who has to deal with large sums of money. He kept the accounts very creditably. The rest of the staff including the 2nd Clerk is reported to have worked satisfactorily and loyally. G. W. P.

No. 349BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1915. Lieutenant-Colonel P. F. Chapman, I.M.S., held charge of the Asylum throughout the year, except for a short period from the 1st May 1915 to the 7th July 1915, when it was held by Honorary Captain J. Robertson, I.S.M.D., during the period of Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman's deputation to Pachmarhi as Civil Surgeon. STATEMENT I. Admissions. 2. Three hundred and seventy-four lunatics (290 males and 84 females) were under confinement at the commencement of the year. There was overcrowding on the male side through- out the year, as the accommodation in the Asylum is for 274 males only. Admis- sions (including 4 re-admissions and 33 cases under observation) were 137 (126 males and 11 females) against 120 in 1914. Of the 137 admissions, 27 were criminals (26 males and 1 female). The Nagpur District, as in the previous year, furnished the largest number (26) of the admissions. 13 were from Port Blair. The total number in the Asylum at the close of the year was 366, includ- ing 94 criminal lunatics and 2 cases under observation, against 374, 80 and nil last year. Discharges. 3. Ninety-nine lunatics were discharged this year against 35 in the previous year. 56 were discharged as cured, 4 improved and 39 discharged as otherwise, against 25, 8 and 2, respectively, in the previous year. Of the 39 discharged otherwise, 30 were cases under observation and 4 escaped (2 criminals and 2 non-criminals), one of whom (criminal) was re-captured and brought back. Out of the 56 discharged as cured, 6 were females. Sickness and mortality. 4. One hundred and ninety-seven lunatics were admitted into the hospital (157 males and 40 females) against 84 in the previous year ; of these 58 were discharged as cured, 93 transferred to the infirm gang and 46 died, leaving no balance at the close of the year. One male lunatic died during the period of observation. Of the 46 deaths, 6 patients received in a moribund condition died within one month of their admissions. The deaths were from dysentery (11), tubercle of the lungs (12), other tubercle infection (3), old age and general debility (7), epilepsy (4), enteritis (2), and one each from mania, melancholia, leprosy, meningitis, heat apoplexy, cerebral hæmorrhage and pneumonia. Out of the 13 admissions from Port Blair, 8 were in bad health, 3 in indif- ferent health, and 2 were in fair health. Of these 4 died within six months of their admissions. It may be added that one patient suffering from tubercle bacillus and the other from chronic dysentery were received in the Asylum from Port Blair. Of the 15 deaths from tuberculosis, 7 were received infected from outside and 8 probably contracted the infection in the Asylum. 5. With all possible precautions in segregating infected patients and the administration of medicines, the deaths from dysentery ran up 11, compared with only 3 last year. Four of these cases were among new admissions. 6. Proposals for providing separate accommodation for tubercular and other infected cases, as well as a new ward for 30 males, have been under consideration, and the Superintending Engineer has been asked to have the plans and esti- mates revised and fresh ones prepared in Stage II for all the works with a view to obtaining fresh administrative sanction.
2 7. Oleum eucalypti treatment twice and santonine treatment once during the year were given to all the infected inmates for 3 days, and the result of their stool examination was as under:3 STATEMENT Ætiological factors and associated conditions. 12. The principal predisposing and exciting causes of the cases admitted were :4 his last visit to the Asylum, the proposals were reconsidered by the Official Visitors, and definite proposals will be submitted for the sanction of the Local Administration as soon as the plans and estimates in Stage II have been received from the Public Works Department. Locking arrangements for flushing pipes. 17. Although a sum of Rs. 438 was sanctioned for locking arrangements to prevent wastage of water, the work remained incomplete. This was due to the fact that the pattern of the iron- boxes prepared by the Public Works Department was not altogether satisfactory and had to be returned. List of property of lunatics. 18. During the year under report a circular letter was issued to all the District Magistrates in the Central Provinces and Berar asking them to direct all the Subordinate Magistrates to mention on the back of the warrants the private property of lunatics sent by them to the Asylum, to enable the Local Auditor to check the register of property maintained at the Asylum with these warrants.

No. 197-C / VI Central Provinces Administration MEDICAL DEPARTMENT FROM THE HON'BLE MR. J. HULLAH, I.C.S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 14th April 1917. SIR, I am directed to submit, herewith, two copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces for the year 1916, and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year 1917 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. HULLAH, Second Secretary. Govt. Press, Nagpur :BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1916. Lieutenant-Colonel P. F. Chapman, I. M. S., was in charge of the asylum throughout the year except for a period of six weeks (from the 7th May 1916 to the 17th June 1916), when he was on privilege leave and Mr. T. W. Quinn, Civil Surgeon, officiated for him. STATEMENT I. Admissions. 2. 366 lunatics (288 males and 78 females) were under confinement at the beginning of the year. There was slight over- crowding throughout the year on the male side, as the accommodation in the asylum is for 274 males only. Admissions (including 1 readmission and 27 cases under observation) were 111 (82 males and 29 females), against 137 in the past year. Of the 111 admissions, 22 were criminals (17 males and 5 females). The Nagpur District as usual furnished the largest number (26) of the admissions. At the close of the year the total number of inmates in the asylum was 362, including 97 criminal lunatics, against 366 and 94 last year. There was no lunatic under observation at the end of the year. Discharges. 3. 75 lunatics were discharged this year, against 99 in the previous year; 40 were discharged as cured, 5 improved and 30 discharged as otherwise, against 56, 4 and 39, respectively, in the past year. Of the 30 discharged otherwise, 29 were cases under observation. Out of 40 discharged as cured, 3 were females. Sickness and mortality. 4. 219 lunatics (164 males and 55 females) were admitted into the hospital, against 197 last year. Of these, 46 were dis- charged as cured, 133 transferred to the infirm gang and 40 died (26 males and 14 females), leaving no balance at the close of the year. Out of the 40 deaths, 2 patients received in a moribund condition died within one month of their admissions. The deaths were from tubercle of the lungs (11), other tubercular infection (6), dysentery (8), debility and old age (4), epilepsy (2), plurisy (2), and one each from sunstroke, pyrexia, obstruction of bowels, heart disease, meningitis, peritonitis and scurvy. There were 13 admissions from Port Blair last year. Of these, 4 died in 1915. Out of the remaining 9 lunatics from Port Blair, 2 died this year, 2 are in bad health, 4 in the infirm gang, and 1 in fair health. Of the 17 deaths from tubercular infection, 4 were received infected from outside and the remaining 13 probably contracted the infection in the asylum. Of the 8 deaths from dysentery against 11 last year, 2 were among new admissions. 5. Oleum eucalypti and santonine treatment were given to all the inmates once during the year, and the result of the examination of stools was as under :2 6. During the year under report plague was very severe in the vicinity of the asylum. Rats died in the asylum premises and staff quarters. These were examined and found positive to plague, and measures were taken to disin- fect the places where dead rats were found and to keep the inmates segregated. All the inmates and the staff were inoculated, huts were constructed for segre- gation, and the result was that there was not a single case of plague among the inmates. Amongst the staff there were 3 cases (1 female and 2 children) ; the children probably contracted the disease by playing about in the infected locality. All these three were unprotected. The children succumbed and the female recovered. 7. The ratio of deaths per cent of average strength amongst the inmates of the asylum in 1916 was 10.99 against 12.30 last year. The death-rate per cent for 1916 in other Provinces of India was 14.44 in Assam, 11.28 in Bihar and Orissa, 11.14 in Bengal, 10.71 in the Punjab, 10.21 in Madras, 8.2 in Bombay, 6.48 in the United Provinces and 6.26 in Burma. STATEMENT II. Criminal lunatics. 8. The admissions were 22 against 27 last year. Discharges were 8 against 6, and the deaths were 11 against 7. The number remaining at the close of the year was 97 (82 males and 15 females) against 94 in the past year. STATEMENT III. 9. These do not call for any special comment. Religion, sex and residence. STATEMENT IV. Previous occupation. STATEMENT V. Age. STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. 10. As usual mania under its various sub-heads was the commonest type of insanity. Under this head 67 patients or 80 per cent of total admissions (excluding cases under observation) were admitted, against 71 or 68 per cent in the previous year. The number of recoveries from this type was 38 and 2 improved. Next comes melancholia with 12 admissions (excluding observation cases) or 14 per cent, against 13 or 12 per cent in 1915. There was only one recovery from this type and 3 improved. Under dementia admissions were 3 or 4 per cent, against 10 or 9 per cent last year. None of them recovered. One case was admitted for idiocy and one recovered during the year. Probably a case of cretinism improved under thyroid. STATEMENT VII. Ætiological factors and associated conditions. 11. The principal predisposing and exciting causes of the cases admitted were :3 The rest were from different other groups. The difficulty in grouping the cases for want of information in the Medical History Sheet pointed out in previous years still exists. In 24 cases the causes had to be ascertained from the relatives and friends of the patients after their admissions. STATEMENT VIII. Finance. 12. The total amount spent for the upkeep of the asylum was Rs. 67,868 against Rs. 60,376 in the last year. The increase during the year under report was due to the construction of a few additional buildings out of those sanctioned by the Local Administration to the extent of Rs. 45,028. The cost of the buildings constructed was Rs. 7,603. Excluding the Public Works Department charges and other book receipts, the expenditure during the year was Rs. 59,486 against Rs. 56,484 last year. The increase was due to the fact that payment of articles for two months which remained unpaid last year, vide paragraph 13 of last year's report, had to be paid during the year under report, and also to the fact that articles of diet, etc., were stocked in the season for the whole year up to March in large quantity as the admissions were gradually increasing at the beginning of the current year. Under rates and taxes the expenditure was Rs. 3,353 against Rs. 4,346, the decrease being due to the non-receipt of the bill for the last quarter before the close of the year. Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 4,340 against Rs. 5,234 and miscellaneous receipts were Rs. 2,113 against Rs. 4,090 in the past year. The decrease under the former head was due to the discharge of 8 and death of 5 paying patients, and under the latter head to the fact that the sale of old and rejected cattle had increased the amount for the last year. Remittances to the Treasury were Rs. 6,453 against Rs. 9,324 in the previous year. The average cost of a lunatic was Rs. 142-4-6 against Rs. 118-2-5 last year. Excluding Public Works Department charges, it was Rs. 126-5-6 against Rs. 111-12-4. Excluding the receipts from paying patients, which are credited to Government, the cost per head was Rs. 133-2-11 against Rs. 107-14-6. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 13. There was no change in the establishment during the year under report. STATEMENT X. Manufactures, etc. 14. The profits during the year from the farm and manufacturing depart- ments amounted to Rs. 2,844 against Rs. 4,338 last year. The decrease was due to the stoppage of the blanket industry for want of woollen yarn, the cost of which was prohibitive on account of the war, and to the auction of old and rejected cattle last year, which increased the profits for that year. General remarks. 15. Administrative sanction for the construction of certain buildings amounting to Rs. 45,028 was received during the year. The works, have been taken in hand by the Public Works Department and are in progress. The compound wall round the female ward has been completed during the year under report. These new buildings include special accommodation for tubercular and other infectious diseases which is at present wanting in the asylum. List of property of lunatics. 16. The private property of lunatics sent to the asylum by magis- trates is not shown on the back of the warrants by the confining magistrates, although a circular letter to that effect was issued last year. Notice of Officers. 17. The Superintendent reports that Deputy Superintendent Kashi- nath has performed all his duties to his entire satis- faction. His care and attention to the unfortunates under his charge have been all that could be wished. On the administrative
4 and business side the asylum has been well managed. Special credit is due to him for the fact that, though plague was raging all round and rats were dying all over the asylum, none of the inmates were attacked. He was given the well deserved honour of Rao Sahib on the 1st January 1917. Narayan Madhao, 1st clerk, has worked very well. He is an excellent clerk, hard-working and accurate. Second clerk Madhao Laxman has also worked most creditably. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Pangarkar deserves a word of special praise for the careful and energetic way in which he has carried out the medical duties evolving on him. Mrs. Brodie, Matron, has worked well on the female side. The warder staff as a whole have done good work. W. H. B.

No. 79-B/IX. Central Provinces Administration MEDICAL DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 7th May 1918. READis ascribed to these instructions. It is disappointing to find that Magistrates still disregard the standing orders as regards filling up the history sheets and listing the private property of the lunatics sent to the asylum. Special instructions on the subject were issued last year. 5. Sir Benjamin Robertson observes with satisfaction that proper economy, compatible with the comfort and well-being of the inmates, was observed in the management of the asylum during the triennium. Notwithstanding the rise in prices due to the war and increased establishment charges, the average cost per lunatic (excluding Public Works Department charges) stood at Rs. 111-12-4 in 1915, at Rs. 126-5-6 in 1916, and at Rs. 118-15-5 in the year 1917. These compare favourably with the corresponding figure of Rs. 128-11-3 for the last of the three preceding years. 6. The official visitors continued to evince interest in the management of the asylum. The Chief Commissioner has under consideration the question of appointing non-official visitors, with a view to enlisting the interest of the public in the welfare of the institution. Sir Benjamin Robertson notices with satisfaction the encomium passed by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals on the work of Lieut.-Col., P. F. Chapman, I.M.S., during the period of his superintendence of the asylum. His thanks are also due to Rao Sahib K. G. Paonaskar, the Deputy Superintendent, whose meritorious services for many years were recognised by the conferral on him of the title of Rao Sahib in January 1917. ORDER : TABLE OF CONTENTS.

Lieutenant-Colonel P. F. Chapman, I.M.S., was in charge of the asylum from the 1st January 1915 to the 26th July 1917, except for short periods from the 1st May 1915 to the 7th July 1915 and from the 3rd May 1917 to the 4th July 1917, when it was held by Honorary Captains J. Robertson and M. Windross, respectively, during the periods of his deputation to Pachmarhi as Civil Surgeon and, from the 7th May 1916 to the 17th June 1916, when he was on privilege leave, Mr. T. W. Quinn, Civil Surgeon, officiating for him. He reverted to military duty, making over charge to Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Bensley, I.M.S., who held it from the 27th July 1917 to the 1st August 1917, when he was relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Buchanan, I. M.S., who remained in charge to the end of the period under report. STATEMENT I2 Of those discharged cured, 105 suffered from mania, 6 from melancholia, 2 from dementia, 2 from errors of development and 1 from post-febrile insanity. Of those discharged otherwise, 79 were observation cases, 8 were criminal lunatics who were transferred to the list of non-criminals, one European lunatic from Jubbulpore was returned to the confining magistrate for want of accommo- dation for such lunatics and another was transferred to the Yerrowda asylum in the Bombay Presidency after three days' stay in the asylum, one lunatic, after confinement in the asylum as a criminal lunatic, was convicted and sent to jail and 5 escaped. Two of these were non-criminal lunatics and the three others were criminal lunatics. One was recaptured and the other four are still at large. Sickness and mortality. 5. There were 534 admissions into the hospital against 338 in the pre- vious triennium. The principal diseases were : tubercle of lungs, 38 ; other tubercular infection, 20 ; dysen- tery, 112 ; old age and general debility, 104 ; apoplexy (cerebral hæmorrhage), 4 ; heatstroke, 2 ; leprosy, 3 ; acute mania, 9 ; melancholia, 6 ; scurvy, 4 ; pneumo- nia, 9 ; pleurisy, 4 ; asthenia, 2 ; anorexia, 15 ; meningitis, 3 ; heart disease, 2 ; tetanus, 1. 6. The number of deaths for the past nine years was 31 in 1909, 79 in 1910, 15 in 1911, 29 in 1912, 20 in 1913, 21 in 1914, 46 in 1915, 40 in 1916 and 37 in 1917, and a few remarks will be made regarding the influence on the mortality of, first, intestinal parasites and then of tuberculosis. In 1910 the mortality was 79 giving a ratio of 265 per 1,000 and it was suspected that this high mortality was largely due to the presence of intestinal parasites and specially to the ankylostoma duodenalis. Systematic examination of the stools of all the inmates was started and this has been continued at regular intervals. The eucalyptus, chloroform and castor oil treatment for hook-worm has been regularly carried out, with the result that in 1911 the number of deaths fell to 15 or 55 per 1,000 ; since 1911 there have been no cases of anæmia and 3 2 each from apoplexy (cerebral hæmorrhage), heatstroke, pneumonia, pleurisy, asthenia, heart disease, enteritis and one each from leprosy, acute mania, melan- cholia, scurvy, anorexia, tetanus, piles, round worms, ascitis, pyrexia, obstruction of bowels and peritonitis. 7. A good deal of attention has been given in recent years to the prevalence of intestinal parasites in asylums and other institutions in India; a table showing the result of the regular examinations is given below for a number of years :4 STATEMENT III5 The increase in the receipts under the head "value of asylum produce" is most marked in the years 1914 and 1915 and was due to the increase in the area under cultivation. Looking, however, to the figures of each year it would appear that the receipts under this head decreased gradually from 7,900 in 1914 to 7,600 in 1915, 6,800 in 1916 and 5,800 in 1917. This was due to the sale of old cattle which decreased the outturn. No steps were taken to replace the cattle sold, because the demand for dairy supplies is becoming less owing to the opening of the Agricultural and Telinkheri dairy farms from where mostly all officers now get their supplies. Expenditure. The increase of expenditure under the head " establishment" was due to the improvement in the pay and prospects of the asylum staff and for additional establishment sanctioned by the Local Administration during the year 1915. The marked increases under the heads " diet" and " clothing and bedding" were due to the increased number of inmates in the asylum during the three years under report, as compared with the preceding triennium, and also to the payment of higher prices due to the war. The expenditure under the former head during the year 1916 went up very high (Rs. 24,900) and the increase was due to the fact that payment of articles for two months which remained unpaid in 1915 had to be paid during that year and also to the fact that articles of diet, etc., were stocked in large quantities in the season for the whole year up to March. The small increase in the total expendi- ture for the triennium under the head contingencies as compared with the preced- ing triennium is due to the construction of an iron reservoir in the godown for storing grain and for payment of huts constructed for the staff and inmates on account of plague during the year 1916. The great increase in the cost of water is due to the large amount of water used in recent years for flushing the barracks. STATEMENT IX6 Buildings. 23. Several structural improvements to the buildings at a cost of Rs. 50,043 were carried out during the preceding triennium, but these were not enough and the official visitors recom- mended certain additional works costing about Rs. 37,000. Administrative sanction to the plans and estimates amounting to Rs. 33,800 for new buildings was therefore applied for and received in the year 1915, but in view of the modified scheme that was decided on by the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner at his visit to the asylum in that year, the proposals were reconsidered by the official visitors, and definite proposals were framed and divided into two groups. Administrative sanction for the construction of the buildings in Group I amounting to Rs. 45,028 was applied for and received during the year 1916. The works (14 in number) were then taken in hand by the Public Works Department, four of which were completed during the triennium and others are in progress. The works in Group II (numbering 10) were then taken up and plans and estimates for them amounting to Rs. 26,402 were prepared and sub- mitted to the Local Administration for administrative sanction which was accorded in June 1917. One of these works was completed and all the rest are in progress. Certain additional works costing Rs. 3,124STATISTICAL STATEMENTS. PAGES STATEMENT NO.

No. 139-A/IX. Central Provinces Administration MEDICAL DEPARTMENT FROM THE HON'BLE MR. H. C. GOWAN, I.C.S., SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Nagpur, the 27th April 1920. SIR, I am directed to submit, herewith, two copies of the Notes on the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum in the Central Provinces for the year 1919, and to say that the work will be reviewed in due course when the Triennial Report for the year 1920 is dealt with. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, H. C. GOWAN, Second Secretary. Govt. Press. Nagpur :BRIEF NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE LUNATIC ASYLUM OF NAGPUR FOR THE YEAR 1919. Lieutenant-Colonel A. Buchanan, I.M.S., was in charge of the Asylum throughout the year except for a period from 15th May 1919 to 29th June 1919, when he was deputed to Pachmarhi as Civil Surgeon, and Assistant Surgeon N. P. Shrivastava, L.M.&S., officiated for him. STATEMENT I. Admissions. 2. At the beginning of the year there were 385 lunatics (305 males and 80 females) under confinement including 2 males under observation. Although the number of males was greater by 13 than the number for whom there is accommodation, overcrowding was avoided, as 15 recovered lunatics were not locked up in the wards but were allowed to sleep in verandahs. The number of inmates at the end of the year was 307 males and 85 females. Admissions (including 6 re2 Discharges. 3. 71 lunatics were discharged this year against 58 in the preceding year ; 32 were discharged as cured, 7 improved and 32 were discharged as otherwise against 25, 1 and 32, respectively, in 1918. Of the 32 discharged otherwise 28 (21 males and 7 females) were cases under observation and 4 were transferred to the list of non-criminals. Sickness and mortality. 4. The mortality was exceptionally high giving a percentage mortality of 13.2, the highest in the past 8 years. There were 53 deaths ; of these 27 occurred in the three months July, August and September. In the last three months of the year there were only 2 deaths. The high mortality in 1919 may be attributed to the following causes :3 5. Oleum Eucalypti treatment was given to all the inmates twice during the year and the result of the examination of stools was as under :4 The difficulty in grouping cases for want of information in the Magistrate's statement still exists. STATEMENT VIII. Finance. 12. The total amount spent for the up-keep of the Asylum was Rs. 1,09,388 against Rs. 91,683 in 1918. Out of this amount Rs. 21,801 was spent towards the additional buildings sanctioned by the Local Administration. Excluding the Public Works Depart- ment charges and other book adjustments the expenditure was Rs. 86,902 against Rs. 58,102 in the preceding year. The increase was mainly due to the abnormally high prices that had to be paid for food and other articles and to the withholding in 1918 of the payment of Rs. 7,000 on account of Grain, as the Contractor failed to supply the contracted quantity of grain before December 1918, and partly to the payment of War Allowance to the Staff. Under rates and taxes the expenditure was Rs. 3,419 against Rs. 2,492 ; the increase was due to the flushing of wards, hospitals and the drains during the period of cholera. Receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 4,432 against Rs. 4,142 ; other remittances into the Treasury were Rs. 3,246 against Rs. 3,828 in 1918. The average cost of up-keep of a lunatic was Rs. 211 against Rs. 193 in the preceding year (the stock in hand is not taken into consideration). Exclud- ing the Public Works Department charges the cost was Rs. 169 against Rs. 122 and excluding the receipts from paying patients, which are credited to the Government, the cost per head was Rs. 161 against Rs. 114. As pointed out last year the amount of Rs. 7,000 which was held over for payment has to some extent affected the rise in the cost of maintenance. If this amount is added to the last year's figures and deducted from this year's expenditure the average cost per head would be Rs. 147 against Rs. 128 in 1918. STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 13. There was no change in the establishment sanctioned, but owing to the high wages that a person gets outside the Asylum, some difficulty was experienced in retaining the services of warders. It will be seen from the statement that there were 5 posts vacant on the male side at the close of the year. STATEMENT X. Manufacture. 14. The profits during the year from manufacturing departments amounted to Rs. 3,824 against Rs. 3,936 in 1918. GENERAL REMARKS. Buildings. 15. Several structural improvements to buildings which were proposed to be carried out in two groups at a total cost of Rs. 78,449 and which were administratively sanctioned in the years 1916 and 1917 (i. e., Group I in 1916 and Group II in 1917) have neared completion. The official visitors recommended certain additional staff quarters, &c., costing about Rs. 29,000. Administrative sanction was obtained for the construction of these works in March 1919 and they are in progress. 16. The additional buildings sanctioned in Secretariat No. 51-A/IX, dated the 26th March 1919, are in progress, but the hospitals handed over to the Public Works Department for additions and alterations in the year 1917 have not been completed. Amusements. 17. Petty rewards to well behaved lunatics amounting to Rs. 192 were, as usual, given to the lunatics which they appreciated very much. Musical and gramophone entertainments were also given. The Director-General, Indian Medical Service, visited this Asylum once during the year under report, i. e., on the 12th February 1919, and wrote as follows :5 and so many of them engaged in some form of employment. The management appears to me to be excellent and to reflect great credit on all concerned. I too think that Rao Sahib Kashinath Gopal has thoroughly deserved the title. " 18. Rao Sahib Kashinath Gopal has continued to devote the same amount of care and attention to the management of the Asylum. Mrs. Brodie has worked well as matron and Head Clerk Narayan Madho has kept the accounts so carefully that for three years in succession the Auditor's review showed a complete absence of errors. Lieut.-Colonel Buchanan, the Superintendent, has managed this important charge with his usual zeal and energy, and the result in a year of great stress and many difficulties is satisfactory. C. H.

Brief Notes to accompany the Annual Statements of the Lunatic Asylum, Nagpur, for the year 1922. Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. S. Oxley, I.M.S., was in charge of the Asylum throughout the year except for three months, April, May and June, when he was deputed to Pachmarhi as Civil Surgeon and Mr. Narbada Prasad Shrivastava, L.M.&S., M.B., B.S., Assistant Surgeon, officiated for him. 2. The special feature of the year was the scarcity of water. In order to supplement the ordinary supply measures were taken the cost of which amounted to Rs. 5,600. Notwithstanding this increased expenditure the total cost to Govern- ment was less than last year by about Rs. 6,000 as considerable savings accrued due to non-payment of water-rate for sometime and to the reduction under cloth- ing, diet, contingencies and establishment charges. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions. 3. At the beginning of the year there were 384 lunatics (304 males and 80 females) under confinement; 56 (44 males and 12 females) including 12 re-admissions (all males) were admitted during the year making a total of 440 (348 males and 92 females). The decrease in admissions, compared with last year the figure for which was 95, is due to the fact that admissions of new lunatics from Central India Agency, and those of the Central Provinces and Berar (except dangerous and serious cases) was temporarily stopped under the orders of the Local Gov- ernment from February to the middle of July 1922, owing to the scarcity of water in the Asylum. The largest number of lunatics confined on any one night during the year was 305 males and 81 females. There is accommodation in the Asylum for 304 males and 126 females. The number of inmates at the close of the year was 341 (267 males and 74 females) including 101 criminals against 384 and 106, respectively, last year. As usual the Nagpur district furnished the largest number of admissions (19). Buldana contributed 8, Raipur 5, Bastar State 1, Central India 1, and the rest were from other districts of Central Provinces and Berar. Discharged. 4. Seventy-nine lunatics were discharged this year against 63 last year; 36 were discharged as cured, 7 improved, 2 not improved and 34 were discharged as otherwise against 50, 7, 1 and 5, respectively, in 1921. Of the 34 discharged as otherwise, 25 harmless male lunatics were handed over to wealthy persons in the Central Provinces and Berar as sanctioned by the Visitors for employment on their estates. It appeared to the Superintendent of the Asylum that the instructions contained in Book Circular, Part VII, No. 1, had been somewhat overlooked. At his instance, therefore, the Local Government issued a Circular, No. 2526-1398-V, dated the 17th October 1922, directing more careful observance of these rules. The total admissions dropped from 90 in the year 1921 to 44 in 1922. It is true that admissions to the Asylum, except for Nagpur district and dangerous cases, were stopped from February to the middle of July 1922 on account of water scarcity, yet the patients detained in their own districts could have been sent here in August had they remained insane. As there was no particular rush of admissions when the embargo was removed, there is a strong suspicion that unsuitable cases were formerly sent and that by exercising more care and discrimination as required by the Book Circular a similar reduction of admissions ought to be maintained in future. Four were transferred to the list of non-criminals, 1 returned to jail owing to the water scarcity and 4 escaped (3 males and 1 female). The escaped were all non-criminals and are still at large. They were approaching recovery. Cases under observation. 5. Three cases remained under observation on 1st January 1922, 30 were admitted during the year against 31 last year. Of these 33, 15 were finally certified to be insanes and admitted into the Asylum against 24 last year, 7 discharged by the Magistrates under section 14 of Act IV of 1912, 9 were uncertified as they did not exhibit symptoms of lunacy and 2 remained at the close of the year.
2 Sickness and mortality. 6. The mortality during the year was 20 against 43 last year, giving a percentage of 5.73 against 10.93 last year. The princi- pal causes of deaths were :3 8 admissions or 14.28 per cent against 15 or 15.79 per cent last year. Reco- veries under this type were 4, and 1 improved. Under Errors of development there were 2 admissions and Dementia contributed 2. STATEMENT No. VII. Ætiological factors and associated conditions. 11.

No.-1417/277-IX GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL PROVINCES MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT Nagpur, the 11th June 1924. READ2 5. The health of the patients during the period under review was satis- factory. The number of deaths fell from 118 to 87. The ratio of death per cent of average strength was 7.89 as against 10.13 of the last triennium. These figures compare favourably with those of other mental hospitals in India. Deaths from tuberculosis were 20 as compared with 44 in the preceding triennium. There was also a remarkable reduction in the incidence of tubercular disease, even after making allowance for the difference in the daily average strength of the two consecutive triennia. The hope expressed in the last review that it would be possible to combat the disease more successfully in future, in view of the arrangements made for tuberculosis cases, has been justified. The Tubercle segregation wards for which Colonel P. F. Chapman, C.I.E., I.M.S., was responsible have greatly contributed to this gratifying result. Cholera was absent in the Hospital although there was an epidemic in the town in the year 1921. The general tone of health of the inmates was decidedly better. The improvement was in part due to the introduction of a new scale of diet by Lieut.-Colonel Oxley, the Superintendent of the Hospital, providing for variety in diet. 6. The average cost of dieting and clothing and bedding was Rs. 107 in 1921, Rs. 112 in 1922 and Rs. 110 in 1923 as compared with Rs. 102 in 1920. This average is still well within the sanctioned maintenance charge for an inmate of Rs 10 per month. There has been a steady increase in the receipts from paying patients. In 1918 the income from this source was Rs. 4,142, while in 1923 it had risen to Rs. 11,937. 7. During the triennium the Board of Visitors met regularly and the members displayed much interest in the management of the Hospital. The Local Government desires to acknowledge the zeal with which Lieut.-Colonel Oxley discharged his duties as Superintendent and the work of Mr. A. K, Sen Gupta, M.B.,B.S., Officiating Deputy Superintendent, who has introduced many improvements contributing to the well being of the patients. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Paras.

Designation. The former designation " Lunatic Asylum " has been altered to " Mental Hospital" from the 25th September 1923. Officers-in-charge. 2. Lieut.-Colonel P. F. Chapman, C.I.E., I.M.S., was in charge from the 1st January to the 11th April 1921, when he handed over charge to Lieut.-Colonel J. C. S. Oxley, I.M.S., who remained in charge to the end of the period under report, except for the months April, May and June in 1922 and 1923, during which two periods he was deputed to Pachmarhi as Civil Surgeon, and Mr. Narbada Prasad Shrivastava, L.M.&S., M.B.,B.S., Assistant Surgeon, officiated for him. STATEMENT No. I. Accommodation and Popula- tion. 3. The accommodation at the close of the last triennium, i.e., 304 males and 126 females, remained unchanged during the period under report. The largest number present on any one night during the last three years was 413 (325 males and 88 females) in 1921, 386 (305 males and 81 females) in 1922 and 354 (276 males and 78 females) in 1923, against 392, 402 and 407 in 1918, 1919 and 1920 respectively. The slight overcrowding on the male side in 1921, was mitigated by allowing some of the recovered male lunatics to sleep in the verandahs. A proposal was sanctioned in 1920 to increase the accommodation by the addition of a new barrack for 20 patients and special accommodation for 8 paying patients. Paying wards were badly needed and are now nearly finished and will be brought into use almost immediately. The Superintendent of the Mental Hospital considered it possible for the present to do without the additional barrack for ordinary patients, and at his suggestion this work was postponed. The fact that there has been no overcrowding during 1923 suggests that there is no immediate demand for this building. 4. Under the orders from the Local Government the admission of new lunatics (except from the Nagpur district and dangerous and serious cases from other districts) was temporarily stopped from February to the middle of July 1922 owing to the scarcity of water, and the Local Government also issued a circular directing the more careful observance by Confining Magistrates of the rules contained in the Book Circular, Part VII, No. I, as it appeared to the Local Government that the instructions contained in these rules had been somewhat overlooked. This appears to have had some effect, but not a few unsuitable cases are still being received and Magistrates should still carefully consider the cases brought before them in the light of those instructions before committing patients to the Mental Hospital. Admissions and Re-admis- sions. 5. 395 lunatics (308 males and 87 females) were under confinement at the commencement of the triennium. The admissions during the period under report were 218 against 269 in the previous triennium. There were no admissions as voluntary boarders during the last three years against 4 in the preceding triennium. Cases under Observation. 6. In accordance with the orders issued by the Government of India in letter No. 13-L.A., dated the 2nd July 1921, changes regarding classification of cases under observation were adopted from the commencement of the period under report. Only 1 female was under observation at the commencement of the period under notice. The num- ber of admissions and re-admissions was 91 against 92 in the previous triennium. Discharges. 7. Discharges were 186 against 126 as detailed below: 2 Of those discharged " Cured," 97 suffered from Mania, 14 from Melancholia, 2 from Delusional insanity, 1 from insanity due to alcohol and 1 from insanity due to Cannabis indica. Of those discharged as " Improved," 14 suffered from Mania, 5 from Melancholia, 1 from Dementia, 1 from Delusional insanity and 1 from Imbecility. Of the " Not Improved," 4 suffered from Melancholia and 1 from Imbecility. Such cases are sometimes allowed to return to the care of their relatives who express the desire to look after them. Of those discharged " Otherwise, " 13 were criminal lunatics transferred to the list of non-criminals, 1 transferred to Jail owing to the water scarcity, 4 escaped, 1 European patient was sent to the Ranchi Mental Hospital and 25 harmless lunatics were handed over to wealthy persons in the province in 1922, as sanctioned by the visitors, for employment on their estates. 8. In 1922, 4 non-criminal lunatics, who were approaching recovery, escaped and are still at large. In the year 1923, 2 non-criminal lunatics escaped while working in the fields, but they were brought back with the assist- ance of the police. The number of lunatics who escaped and were not recaptured during the period under report is 4 against 1 in the previous triennium. Sickness and Mortality. 9. There were 468 admissions into the hospital against 627 in the previous triennium. The principal diseases were :3 Even making an allowance for the difference in the daily average strengths of the two consecutive triennia (363.57 in 19214 STATEMENT IV. Previous occupation. 21. Beggars, labourers, cultivators, private servants, shopkeepers and those " depending on others" contributed the largest number of admissions. In 43 cases the previous occupa- tion could not be traced against 11 in the previous triennium. Out of 9 military insanes remaining at the commencement of the triennium one was discharged as cured in 1922 and 8 still remain insane. STATEMENT V. Age on admission. 22. The largest number of admissions was, as in the previous triennium, between the ages of 20 to 40, which is the period of greatest stress and pressure. STATEMENT VI. Types of insanity. 23. As usual, Mania heads the list of admissions, contributing 68.35 per cent. Melancholia comes next with 16.97, Errors of development 6.42, Insanity due to Cannabis indica 2.75, Insanity due to alcohol and Dementia each contributed 1.84, and the rest were from other types. STATEMENT VII. Ætiological factors and associated conditions. 24. The principal predisposing and exciting causes of insanity in those admitted during the triennium were :5 STATEMENT IX. Establishment. 28. There has been no change in the establishment except that three additional female sweepers were sanctioned from the 1st. March 1922 and two posts of graziers (menial ser- vants) abolished with effect from the 1st April 1923. A form of penalty bond and security deposit of Rs. 25 from each warder was introduced in 1921 to prevent the frequent resignations at short notice which had interfered with discipline. The question of placing the Mental Hospital attendants on the same footing as Jail warders in respect of service and pension was referred to the Local Government in 1922 and was sanctioned in 1923. These two measures have greatly contributed towards the satisfactory management of the institution. STATEMENT X. Profit and Loss. 29. Profits during the period under report were Rs. 19,011-7-11 against Rs. 10,326 in the previous triennium. The financial results of the dairy were not satisfactory, and the Director of Agriculture kindly sent an expert in 1921 to report on the working of the dairy. Cattle not yielding sufficient quantity of milk and other cattle of not much use were auctioned during 1922 and 1923 and Montgomery cows and Delhi she-buffaloes of better strain were purchased from the Telinkheri dairy. Efforts were also made to increase the area of the gardens to grow more vegetables for the inmates. The manufacture of blankets was stopped for want of yarn; this has again been started in 1923. All these have resulted in an increase of profits during the period under report. A provision of Rs. 3,000 was made for the improvement of the dairy cattle, but as sufficient numbers of good cattle could not be obtained in 1923, only Rs. 1,000 were expended out of the allotment. General Remarks. Diet. 30. A new scale of diet was introduced as reported in the year 1922 and has effected a saving of over Rs. 2,000 without causing any detriment to the general health of the inmates. On the contrary, this new scale of diet providing; for variety in the food served to the patients has had some influence in bringing about the general improvement in health which has undoubtedly occurred. The Superintendent of the Mental Hospital is convinced, in particular, of the value of the issue of germinated gram along with the morning meal. Buildings. 31. Stage II plans and estimates of the additional buildings (4 in number) amounting to Rs. 27,913 were sanctioned during the period under report and the work is rapidly nearing completion. These buildings, when completed, will provide suitable accommo- dation for 8 well-to-do paying patients, and thus a long-felt want will be at an end. 32. The remodelling of the cook-house and cooking range is urgently required as the present arrangements are unsuitable. Plans have been prepared which will prove satisfactory. 33. Another requirement is a new Out-patient department attached to the hospital. The present plan of attending out-patients in a small room at the other end of the compound is most unsatisfactory. This room could be utilized to advantage as a disinfecting and storing room for clothing. It would be convenient for this purpose as it adjoins the clothing store-room. Employment. 34. Male lunatics are generally employed on the farm, in the gardens, dairy and general cleaning. A few are employed in cooking weaving, carpentry and smith's work. Females are employed in grain-cleaning gardening and general cleaning. Rewards. 35. The system of giving petty rewards to those who work well has been continued and is appreciated by the lunatics; they spend the money as they please, but generally in sweets and books. Amusements. 36. Gramophone and Ramlila entertainments were given to the inmates as usual Some of the well-behaved and recovered lunatics were allowed to go to see the Muharram and Ganpati processions. Sweets were also distributed at the Holi festival as well
6 as to the Christian patients on Christmas day. During the latter part of the year 1923 Mr. A. K. Sen Gupta, the Officiating Deputy Superintendent, intro- duced games of Badminton and Football. The innovation has proved a success, and these games are appreciated by some of the patients as well as by the members of the staff. Instructions in First Aid. 37. A First-Aid class has been started in the Hospital from December 1923 according to the rules of the St. John Ambulance Association. Meetings of Visitors. 38. The Visitors held their meetings regularly throughout the triennium and maintained their usual interest in the management of the Mental Hospital. The Hon'ble Rao Bahadur N. K. Kelkar, the then Minister in charge of the Medical Administration and Public Health, visited the institution in 1921 and the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals visited it in 1921 and 1923. Notice of Officers. 39. Lt.-Col. Oxley carried out the duties of Superintendent of the institution with zeal and ability during nearly the whole of the triennial period. Rao Bahadur K. G. Paonaskar (Deputy Superintendent, on leave) has worked with his usual devotion to the patients under his charge. He is to be congratulated on the receipt of his well-earned distinction of Rao Bahadur bestowed during the year 1923. Mr. A. K. Sen Gupta, M.B., B.S., Officiating Deputy Superintendent, has no special liking for alienist work, but with characteristic energy has thrown himself into the new duties. He has lost no opportunity of devising and suggesting many improvements. Mr. A. V. A. de Araujo, 1st Assistant Medical Officer, officiated as Deputy Superintendent for six months during the absence of Rao Bahadur Paonaskar from the 7th July 1921 to 6th January 1922. He has an intimate knowledge of every one of the patients, with whom he is most popular. Jemadar Vithal Govind Kamat, and Assistant Medical Officer, has further increased his efficiency by passing the Calcutta Tropical School course this year. Mrs. L. Brodie, Matron, has continued to maintain her record for hard work and efficiency. Narayan Madhav, Head Clerk, has done excellent work, the quality of which is proved by a blank audit note. Vinayak Balwant Rao Moharir, 2nd Clerk, is a zealous and reliable worker. Chief Head Warder Sarjusharan has done very valuable work in directing most efficiently the work of the attendants. J. A.

NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE MENTAL HOSPITAL IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR (NAGPUR) FOR THE YEAR 1924
Brief note to accompany the Annual Statements of the Mental Hospital, Nagpur, for the year 1924. Lieut.-Colonel J. C. S. Oxley, I.M.S., was in charge till the 25th January, 1924, when on his transfer to Jubbulpore he handed over charge to Lieut.-Colonel W Tarr, I.M.S., who remained in charge till the end of the year. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions. 2. 340 (265 males and 75 females) lunatics were under confinement at the beginning of the year, 99 (81 males and 18 females), including 6 (5 males and 1 female) read missions, were admitted during the year against 67 last year, making a total of 439 (346 males and 93 females). The number of inmates at the close of the year was 375 (296 males and 79 females), including 111 criminals against 340 and 96 respectively last year. As usual the Nagpur district contributed the largest number of admissions, i.e., 39 (29 males and 10 females), Jubbulpore 10, Amraoti 9, and the rest were from the other districts of the Province and Central India. The additional buildings for 8 well-to-do paying patients having been com- pleted, the accommodation has now increased from 430 to 438 (312 males and 126 females). The largest number present on any one night was 378 (296 males and 82 females), thus there was no overcrowding either on the male or female side. The number of patients paying Rs. 30 and over at the close of the year was 10. Discharges. 3. 47 lunatics were discharged against 44 last year, 36 were discharged as cured, 4 improved, and 7 were discharged otherwise, against 29, 8 and 5 respectively last year. Of the discharged otherwise, 3 males were transferred to the Mental Hospital, Lahore, and 3 (2 males and 1 female) were transferred to the list of non-criminals and 1 male who was a non-criminal lunatic escaped and is still at large. Cases under observation. 4. Six cases remained under observation on the 1st January, 1924 ; 40 were admitted during the year against 29 last year. Of these 46, 25 were finally certified to be insanes and admitted into the hospital, 4 were discharged by the magistrate, 13 were uncertified as they did not exhibit symptoms of lunacy, 1 died and 3 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and mortality. 5. The mortality during the year was 17 against 24 last year, giving a percentage of 4.70 against 7.01 last year. The principal causes of deaths were:2 were treated with carbon tetrachloride instead of Manson's mixture. Dosage used was 60 and 45 minims mixed with 1 drachm of magnesia sulphas according to the age and physical condition of the patient. The results have been quite satisfactory. In only one case was a second treatment necessary. Carbon tetrachloride had no effect on other helminths such as ascaris lumbricoides, trichiurus, whereas Manson's mixture was of some value in such cases. Other helminths found were3 STATEMENT No. IX. Establishment. 12. The establishment remained unchanged during the year under report. STATEMENT No. X. Profit and loss. 13. Profits during the year were Rs. 7,033-1-9 against Rs. 7,814-13-3 last year. The decrease was due to the auction of cattle during 1923 which had increased the receipts of last year. The industry of carpentry has newly been started during the year and is likely to be a source of profit in future. General remarks. The wards for 8 well-to-do paying patients costing Rs. 27,913 as well as the construction of a cook-house and improvement to the cells sanctioned by the Government in the year 1920 were completed during the year under report. A new dispensary and laboratory building is under construction. The Superintendent is of opinion that if each warder had a little hospital training, a more sympathetic and an entirely different attitude would be eventually adopted towards the inmates and the place would be more like a hospital than a jail. The suggestion could easily be made effective by attaching the female warders to the Mayo Hospital for a short period of say 2 or 3 months ; arrangements could also be made to instil some kind of hospital sense into the male warders by making them work as ward boys for a time also in the Mayo Hospital. I approve of this suggestion, and will take steps to carry it into effect. First-Aid training. 14. 44 warders (33 males and 11 females) were trained in First-Aid during the year and the class is still continued. Staff. 15. Rao Bahadur K. G. Paonaskar resumed charge as Deputy Superin- tendent on 24th March 1924, after long leave. His long association with the hospital and intimate knowledge of its administration has been of great assistance to the Superintendent. He has maintained his reputation for hard work and tact in dealing with the many difficult situations that arise in a hospital of this nature. Assistant Medical Officer A. V. A. de Araujo makes an efficient under-study. 16. As Superintendent of the Hospital, Lieut.-Colonel W. Tarr. I.M.S., carried out his duties with marked zeal and efficiency. NAGPUR: J. A.

NOTES ON THE ANNUAL STATEMENTS OF THE MENTAL HOSPITAL IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES AND BERAR (NAGPUR) FOR THE YEAR 1925
AGENTS FOR THE SALE OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY THE CENTRAL PROVINCES GOVERNMENT. [NOTE.Brief note to accompany the Annual Statements of the Mental Hospital, Nagpur, for the year 1925. Lieut -Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., was in charge throughout the year under report except for three months while he was on leave from 14th March to 13th June 1925 when Mr. S. G. Paranjape, L. M. & S. was in charge. STATEMENT No. I. Admissions. 2. 375 (296 males and 79 females) lunatics were under confinement at the beginning of the year2 The death-rate per cent for 1925 in other provinces of India was 14.23 in the Punjab, 11.79 in the United Provinces, 8.48 in Burma, 6.9 in Bombay, 6.59 in Assam and 6.42 in Madras. Ankylostome infections. 6. Of new admissions, 7.22 per cent were already infected against 17.05 last year. The usual treatments of Manson's mixture were carried out at half-yearly intervals. Of 400 patients' stools examined, ankylostomes were detected in 46 cases. These 46 cases were treated with carbon tetrachloride. Dosage used was 60 and 45 minims mixed with 1 drachm of magnesia sulphas according to the age and physical condition of the patient. In 5 patients the treatment had to be repeated. Other helminths found were3 average cost of diet and clothing of a lunatic was Rs. 101 against Rs. 92 last year. The increase was due to the purchase of sufficient clothing and articles of diet for the increased number of inmates at slightly higher rate than last year. STATEMENT No. IX. Establishment. 12. The establishment remained unchanged during the year under report. STATEMENT No. X. Profit and loss. 13. Profits during the year were Rs. 5,934-7-3 against Rs. 7,033-1-9 last year. The decrease was due to the purchase of fodder for the cattle at a slightly higher rate than last year. First Aid training. 14. During the year 6 male warders were trained in First Aid. General remarks. 15. Twelve blocks of two rooms each are considered desirable and necessary to provide accommodation for paying patients and the better class of ordinary patients. Plans and estimates for these are under consideration. The new dispensary and laboratory buildings were completed and taken over for use during the year. This has much improved the facility for supervising the hospital as well as greatly added to efficiency in medical treatment. Amusements. 16. As usual, gramophone entertainments were given and sweets distributed on principal Hindu, Christian and Muhammadan festivals. A few recovered and well-behaved lunatics were allowed to see the processions of Ganpati festival. Some of the inmates take interest in out-door and in-door games. Rewards in the shape of sweets and other petty articles were given to hardworking and deserving patients as usual and were much appreciated by them. 17. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Central Provinces, visited the institution twice during the period under report. Staff. 18. The work of Rao Bahadur K. G. Paonaskar, Deputy Superintendent, was as usual excellent. His long connection with the institution makes a lot of perplexing difficulties appear quite simple. First Assistant Medical Officer A. V. A. de Araujo is a worthy understudy to the Deputy Superintendent. Second Assistant Medical Officer V. G. Kamat has done very good work in the laboratory and is most diligent in his care of the sick. Mrs. L. Brodie, Matron, has looked after her charge with tact and discretion. 19. As Superintendent of the Hospital, Lieut.-Colonel W. Tarr, I.M.S., carried out his duties with marked zeal and efficiency. K. V. KUKDAY, COL, I.M.S., NAGPUR: Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, The 20th February 1926. Central Provinces.

Nagpur, the 7th May 1927. READ2 5. The health of the patients during the period under review was satis- factory. The number of deaths fell from 87 to 61. The percentage of deaths on the average strength of inmates has been steadily declining and was 5.31 as compared with 7.89 and 10.13 respectively in the two preceding triennia. These figures compare favourably with those of the Mental Hospitals in the United Provinces, Bon bay, Madras, Assam, Rangoon and the Punjab. Special mention must be made of the great improvement in the treatment of patients suffering from tuberculosis since the construction of the segregation wards. The heavy toll previously levied viz., 49 in 1915Brief note to accompany the Annual Statements of the Mental Hospital, Nagpur, for the year 1926. Lieut.-Colonel W.

The number of inmates at the close of the year was 397 (313 males and 84 females) including 116 criminals against 390 and 111, respectively, last year. As usual Nagpur district contributed the largest number of admissions, i.e., 33 (24 males and 9 females), Jubbulpore 15, Amraoti 10, and the rest were from other districts of the province and Central India. The number of admissions on reception order on petitions under section 10 of Act IV of 1912 was 7. The total accommodation provided was for 438 (312 males and 126 females) and the largest number accommodated on any one night was 408 (319 males and 89 females). There was a slight excess on the male side but overcrowding was avoided by allowing 7 male patients to sleep in the verandahs of wards at night. The number of paying patients paying Rs. 30 and over at the close of the year was 10. Discharges. 3. 64 lunatics were discharged against 54 last year, 40 as cured, 13 improved (including 2 females transferred to Indian Mental Hospital, Ranchi) and 11 otherwise. Of those discharged otherwise, 6 were transferred to the list of non-criminals, 2 trans- ferred to Mental Hospital, Lahore, 1 transferred to Mental Hospital, Benares, and 2 discharged under section 32 (1) of Act IV of 1912. Cases under observation. 4. One case remained under observation on 1st January 1926, 42 were admitted during the period under report against 49 last year. Of these 43, 24 were certified as insanes and admitted; 4 were discharged by the magistrates, 12 were uncertified as they did not exhibit symptoms of lunacy, 2 died and 1 remained at the close of the year. Sickness and mortality. 5. The mortality during the year was 23 against 21 last year, giving a percentage of 5.79 against 5.46 last year. Deaths were due to the undermentioned causes:2 Ankylostome infections. 6. Of new admissions 12.5 per cent were already infected against 7.22 last year. The usual treatments of Manson's mixture were carried out at half-yearly intervals. Of 417 patients' stools examined ankylostomes were detected in 22 cases. These 22 cases were given combined treatment of chenopodium oil and carbon tetrachloride. Dosage used was 1 c.c. of chenopodium oil and 3 c.c. of carbon tetrachloride followed by a dose of saline. The results were quite satisfactory. Other helminths found were3 STATEMENT NO. X. Profit and Loss. 13. Profits during the year were Rs. 11,169-4-6 against Rs. 5,934-7-3 last year. The increase was due to a larger supply of milk for the sick and infirms, and vegetables to the inmates from the hospital dairy and garden, to the auction of surplus cattle, and also to the amount received from the magistrate at Nagpur as fines recovered by him from owners on account of damage done by cattle in the fields. First-Aid Training. 14. No class was held owing to insufficient number for training. General remarks. 15. Administrative approval of the Local Government to stage I plans and estimates of 12 blocks of two rooms each to provide accommodation for paying patients and the better class of ordinary patients amounting to Rs. 79,000 has been conveyed during the year under Medical Administration and Public Health Department letter No. 3717- 598-IX, dated 23rd/25th October 1926, and the Chief Engineer has been asked to include Rs. 30,000 provisionally in the Civil Works Budget estimates for the year 1927-28 for the purpose, but it has not been possible to do so.

Rewards in the shape of sweets and other petty articles to hardwork- ing and deserving patients were as usual given during the year under report. Staff. 17. Rao Bahadur K. G. Paonaskar, Deputy Superintendent, has well maintained his excellent record. The rest of the staff also performed their duties satisfactorily. 18.
