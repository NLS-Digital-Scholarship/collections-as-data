Preface-General Administration. I HELD charge of the Bengal Veterinary College, the Epizootic Diseases of animals Department in Calcutta and its vicinity and the Raymond Research Laboratory throughout the year. I also held, in addition to my own duties, charge of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, in the absence of the Superintendent of that Department, on leave, from 20th November 1913 to 19th February 1914. 2. I was on tour for 20 days, travelling 3,474 miles, by rail, and 29 miles, by road, during which time I inspected the Rangpur Dairy Farm with the Hon'ble Mr. P. C Lyon and Mr. J. R. Blackwood on the 20th and 21st October 1913 and again with Mr. Blackwood on 31st March 1914 ; attended the 8th meeting of the Board of Agriculture in India held at Coim- batore from 8th to 10th December 1913 ; and acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the Madras Veterinary College from 11 th to 17th December 1913. 3. Mr. E. H. Brand, Assistant Principal, has been granted combined leave for 9 months, viz., 7 months' furlough and 2 months' study leave pre- fixed by 3 months' vacation of the College commencing from 27th March. Veterinary Instruction. 4. Class A.2 " We are in thorough agreement with the report issued by the Board of Examiners lust year, especially with reference to the necessity for improving the teaching staff by the addition of another Imperial officer and the urgent necessity of increasing the prospects of veterinary graduates, in order that men of higher education may be attracted to the College." 12. Stipends.3 To remove the sick and injured animals from the streets of Calcutta and its Suburbs to this hospital, 3 more ambulances have been constructed which will be located at the Calcutta Corporation Gowkhanas at Alipore, Circular Road and Mirzapore Street, as soon as sheds are constructed. The work of removal will be done by the Corporation. Breeding Operations. 24. The return of stud bulls maintained at this College is included in Table VIII of the Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal. Subordinate Establishment. 25. The total strength of subordinate Veterinary staff employed at this College is included in Table VII of the Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal. Expenditure of the College. 26. The main results and the receipts and expenditure of the College are given in Table I. General Remarks. 27. Mr. A. D. MacGregor of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department has been posted to this College for training from the 30th March 1914. The appointment of a second Imperial officer, whose services are indispensably necessary at this College, is under the consideration of Government. 28. College buildings.4 8. During the year 195 dogs and 78 carcasses of dogs from Calcutta and elsewhere were sent to the dog hospital for suspected rabies, of which 90 proved to be suffering from the disease. 9. Eleven inspections of hides were made prior to their shipment to different foreign ports during the year. THE RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY. The work of the Laboratory was carried on in a satisfactory manner. That this institution is gaining popularity is shown by the fact that not only the various Provincial Veterinary Departments sent specimens for examin- ation. but the local private practitioners, both European and Indian, and the general public sought assistance. The examinations of pathological speci- mens and the conduct of autopsies continue to increase in numbers. Materials were supplied to the Imperial Serologist, Lt.-Col. W. D. Sutherland, m.d., i.M.S., Lt.-Col. Sir Leonard Rogers, kt., c.i.e., i.m.s., and Sir John McFadyean, for their work. 2. We have been fortunate to secure the assistance of Mr. T. Southwell for the identification of our cestode collection. A new variety of Indian Tick (Hemaphysalis Innermis Var Aponommoides) has lately been described in the Journal of Parasitology by Mr. Warburton of the University of Cam- bridge from the specimens sent from our collection. This variety is allied to Hemaphysalis Innermis Berula and Hemaphysalis Warburtonii Nuttall. 3. Samples of bone-meal for the New Zealand Government and those of oil-cakes for the Sabour Agricultural College were bacteridogieally examined for the detection of Anthrax or other organisms. 4. A case of Surra was treated by the method suggested by the Imperial Bacteriologist. viz., by Atoxyl and Arsenic. The animal under treatment showed a peculiar idyosyncracy to the drug and unfortunately died. The records will be forwarded to the Imperial Bacteriologist for opinion. 5. Owing to the paucity of the supply of anti-rinderpest serum, a quantity of Edington's Bile was prepared and inoculated into the cattle patients of the hospital, with successful results. We carried out some experiments on the efficacy of Indian " Blistering Beetles " at the instance of the Imperial Entomologist, Pusa, and also investigated an outbreak of Septi- caemia among the monal pheasants of the Zoological Garden. This was an acute infective disease characterised by suddenness of the attack, somnolence, violent diarrhæa and fatal termination within a few hours. It was caused by " Vibrio Metehnikovi" which is morphologically and culturally closely allied to the organism of Asiatic Cholera of man. This disease has so far been little studied in this country. 6. At the instance of Dr. Georgiana Sweet, Professor of Biology in the University of Melbourne, some enquiries were made about the occurrence and prevalence of certain " worm nodules " in cattle. All the public abbatoirs were visited in this connection, but no definite information could be obtained. 7. At my direction Balm Satyendra Nath Mitra, g.b.v.c. Lecturer and Senior Assistant in the Laboratory, read a popular paper on Glanders at the Calcutta Medical Society. Some papers on Veterinary Science were prepared by Babu S. K. Mitra and Babu H. C. Ganguli, g.b.v.c, the Junior Hospital Surgeon, which will shortly be published with the concurrence of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India. 8. One Veterinary Assistant from the Central Provinces and one from Travancore attended the post-graduate course of study. The senior students also received instruction in post-mortem examinations and inoculations of various kinds of preventive Sera and Vaccines. 9. On behalf of the Government of Bihar and Orissa, Babu Satyendra Nath Mitra was deputed with the permission of the Director of Agriculture, Bengal, to Puri to investigate an outbreak of Contagious Opthalmia among the conservancy bullocks there. The disease. which appears peculiar to lower animals. is said to affect human beings as well. A. SMITH, Major. Principal, Bengal Veterinary College.

I was in charge of the Department throughout the. year, except for three months and three days while J was away on leave from the 20th November 1913. During the period of my absence, the current duties of the office were performed by Major Smith, in addition to his own duties as Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. 2. I spent 75 days on tour and travelled 5,251 miles by rail, 257 miles by road and 785 miles by river. Major Smith made no tour during the period of his incumbency. 3. My tour extended to all the districts of the Province except throe, viz., Bankura, Birbhum and .Jessore. These districts did not specially require my presence and owing to my absence on leave, there was not time to make routine tour of inspection. J inspected all the existing veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and selected sites, etc., for other ones under proposal. I paid three visits to Dacca in connection with the selection of sites for the proposed veterinary dispensary at that place. As far as possible the work of the Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants was checked and super- vised. I inspected the stud bulls in the several districts and the working bullocks of the Dacca and Narainganj Municipalities and of the Dacca Agricultural Farm. The condition of these, animals was far from satisfactory, and I advised the authorities as to their better management. I personally attended and carried out mallein test in several outbreaks of glanders and conducted preventive inoculations for rinderpest in Midnapur district. The flooding of the Damodar river in West Bengal in September did a considerable amount of damage, and veterinary work was practically at a standstill in the aftected districts for several months. I also acted as a member of the Examining Board of the Bengal Veterinary College in March 1914. PART I.2 PART II.3 16. Anthrax.4 Table IV. 24. Table TV shows the mofussil work of the Verterinary Assistants. 25. During the year there were 45 Itinerating Veterinary Assistants working in the province and 8 Stationary Assistants who also toured in interior, periodically or when outbreaks of diseases required them to do so. They visited 9,810 villages and treated 50,598 patients against 10,409 villages and 52,705 patients of the previous year. The decrease is mainly due to foot-and-mouth disease being less prevalent during the year. Moreover the outbreaks of Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia being unusually severe in many districts, the attention of the Veterinary Assistants was engaged with the more important duty of inoculation. Considering these facts the total amount of work done by the assistants was fairly satisfactory. Table V.5 35. The Deputy Commissioner of Darjeeling takes a lively interest in the improvement of the Siri breed in his district and maintains several suit- able bulls in the district, at the cost of Government. Some of the District Boards are also alive to the necessity of doing something in this direction and applications for several bulls have been received from the districts of Khulna, Barisal and Midnapore. But we are not yet in a position to comply with their requests, owing to the dearth of suitable bulls. Enquiries are, however, being made for them locally and endeavours will be made to get some from the Garo Hills, as was suggested before by the Director of Agriculture. Fairs and Shows. 36. Tables XIII and XIV show the particulars of the horse and cattle fairs held during the year. 37. All these were inspected either by the Divisional Veterinary Inspectors or the local Veterinary Assistants. They helped in the judging of cattle and explained to the cattle-owners and ethers the method and advan-. tages of improving their stock and also the nature and amount of work rendered by this Department towards the preservation and welfare of cattle. 38. From Table XIV it will be seen that a large sum of money is realised every year in fees from most of the fairs and mêlas, but practically nothing is spent for the improvement of cattle of the localities. The giving of a few money prizes might improve the class of cattle brought by the dealers to the mêla. Bull Rearing and Breeding Farms and Depôts. 39.There were two farms at work during the year, viz.. Kalimpong and Rangpur, and Table LX shows the working thereof. 40.

PressREVENUE DEPARTMENT. AGRICULTURE. CALCUTTA, THE 8TH SEPTEMBER 1914. RESOLUTION2 great difficulties were experienced in coping with it, owing to a shortage in the supply of serum on account of the breakdown in the machinery at the Mukteswar Laboratory, and to the heavy floods which occurred in the first three districts, where the work was practically at a standstill for several months. The mortality would have been much greater, but for the excellent results of preventive inoculation in cases in which serum was available. In the area outside Calcutta and its suburbs, the Department dealt with 210 out- breaks of the disease which caused the death of 3,204 uninoculated animals, while out of 23,836 animals which were inoculated, only 159 or 0.6 per cent. died. Similarly there were only 6 deaths among 5,557 animals inoculated for hæmorrliagic septecæmia. In Calcutta and its suburbs 56 outbreaks of rinderpest which occurred mostly during the latter part of the year were promptly attended to by the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College. Inoculation was performed in 1,911 cases, of which only 32 or 1"6 per cent. died. The Governor in Council notices with satisfaction the improvement which is taking place in reporting the outbreak of infectious and contagious diseases among cattle. Under arrangements recently made such outbreaks will be reported, not only by the police, but also by touring officers of the various Departments of Government and by the Presidents and collecting members of village panchayats, who have been supplied with post-card forms for the purpose. The reports are now sent not only to the local Veterinary Assistants, but also to the Chairman of the District or Local Board concerned, who is thus enabled to call promptly for any further assistance which may be required from the Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department. These arrangements should greatly increase the opportunities of the Department for exorcising its beneficient functions in staying the course of dangerous epidemic diseases. 5. During the year under report the itinerating Veterinary Assistants visited 9,810 villages and treated 50,598 patients, as against 10,409 villages and 52,705 patients in the previous year. The slight decrease is attributed partly to the fact that foot-and-mouth disease was less prevalent during the year, and partly to the unusually severe outbreaks of rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septecæmia in many districts, owing to which the time of the Veterinary Assistants was fully taken up with the more important duty of inoculation. The Superintendent of the Veterinary Department has drawn the attention of Government to the reluctance on the part of many District Boards to employ Additional Veterinary Assistants, who are urgently required, and in view of the material addition lately made to their funds by the surrender of the entire Public Works coss, the Governor in Council trusts that District Boards will co-operate whole-heartedly with the Superintendent in the matter. 6. The administration of the Glanders and Farcy Act was conducted smoothly during the year. In Calcutta and its neighbourhood, about 4,000 stables wore inspected in the area under the Act, and the disease was detected in nine stables. In the mufassal, 194 deaths were reported against 260 in the preceding year. One hundred and fifty-eight deaths occurred in the Sodepore Pinjrapole, but there were severe outbreaks also at Mymensingh and Rangpur. The maximum amount of compensation payable for each animal destroyed under the Glanders and Farcy Act was Rs. 100 in the districts in East Bengal and Rs. 50 in West Bengal. The amount has now been fixed by Government at Rs. 100 for the whole Presidency, and it is hoped that the increased rates of compensation will induce owners to report cases promptly and so assist in the stamping out of the disease. The amount paid as compensation during the year was Rs. 1,339 as compared with Rs. 282 in the previous year. 7. No new dispensary was opened during the year. The total number of patients treated at the existing 18 dispensaries was 21,503 as against 22,106 in the preceding year. The proposal for the establishment of a dispensary at Bakarganj mentioned in the last year's Resolution has been temporarily abandoned, as the District Board have decided not to undertake
3 the work for the present. The establishment of a Veterinary hospital at Dacca has however been sanctioned, and the building work will bo taken up shortly. 8. The number of animals sent to the College Hospital for treatment in connection with cases under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in Calcutta still continues to be small in comparison with the number of prosecutions instituted. The Governor in Council has recently drawn the attention of Magistrates in Calcutta and Alipore to this matter, and has pointed out the futility of punishing owners in cruelty cases by nominal fines without taking advantage of the provisions of the Act, under which animals may be sent to the hospital for medical treatment. It is reported that unfit animals are frequently put to work again immediately after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. His Excellency in Council hopes that trying Magistrates will cease to regard their duties under the Act as completed when they have punished the owner in fault, and that they will make a reasonable use of their powers to send disabled and diseased animals to the hospital for treatment before they are allowed to resume work. 9. The Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department again remarks on the indifference displayed by cattle-owners and the cultivators generally to the efforts which are being made to improve the breed of cattle in this Presidency. It is reported that very little advantage is taken of the stud bulls serving in the various districts which are the property of the Jail authorities or of the District Boards. His Excellency in Council desires again to impress upon the officers of the Agricultural Department the urgent need for utilizing every opportunity of explaining and demonstrating the benefits that may be derived from the improvement of the live-stock of the country. It is hoped that the cattle farm, which has recently been established at Rangpur, will yield results which will convince the cultivators that it will pay them to devote attention to the improvement and proper care of their cattle. 10. The Governor in Council desires to acknowledge the excellent work done during the year by Major Smith, the Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College, and by Mr. Kerr, Superintendent of the Veterinary Department. His Excellency in Council notices with regret the remarks made by Mr. Kerr regarding the apathy and failure to appreciate their responsibilities displayed by many of the Veterinary Assistants. The improvement of the pay and prospects of the service when sanctioned, should attract a bettor class of men, and the services of those who continue to be wilfully inefficient should be dispensed with. The Governor in Council observes with pleasure that the work done by the Inspectors and by the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College was generally satisfactory.
