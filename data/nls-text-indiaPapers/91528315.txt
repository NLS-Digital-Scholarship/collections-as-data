No. 2555. FROM MAJOR E. C. HARE, I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT. Shillong, the 7th August 1906. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the Vaccination Returns of the Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam for the year 1905-1906, together with my notes thereon. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, E. C. HARE, Sanitary Commissioner, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE PROVINCE OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906. Introductory. 1. As the formation of the province took place just at the beginning of the vaccination season, the Bengal and Assam systems were continued in the respective districts without alteration. The results have been incorporated in a combined statement for the two portions of the province. The system on which the compilation has been made requires some explanation:2 Deaths from small-pox. The reported deaths from small-pox numbered 5,637 (.18 per 1,000). The rate was highest in Kamrup (3.17), Darrang (1.32), and Chittagong (.55). A diagram showing the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination during the last seven years is attached. Many of the districts report isolated outbreaks of the disease, some of which originated from cases imported from Calcutta. Dispensary vaccination. 4. Vaccination is practised by Dispensary Officers throughout Assam; but is not in general use in the Eastern Bengal districts. Chittagong, Rangpur, and Noakhali are the exceptions, and operations are also reported from the Medical School at Dacca. Excluding the above, the total dispensary vaccinations in Assam were 26,5423 In Chittagong and Jalpaiguri special efforts were made by the vaccinating staff owing to an outbreak of small-pox. Chittagong obtained the highest results on record for the district. The Civil Surgeons of both districts report on the good work done by the staff. In Faridpur some difficulty was at first experienced on account of the swadeshi movement; European vaccination being held contraband. But on the advice of the Civil Surgeon the District Magistrate and the Subdivisional Officer at Madaripur issued notices calling on the headmen of the villages, in which there was opposition, to show cause why vaccination should not be made compulsory in their villages. The result was an increase of 18,837 primary operations. The Civil Surgeon of Rangpur, though he shows a total increase of 3,520 opera- tions, points out that there was an increase of 8,153 primary vaccinations, and that these were discounted by a fall of 4,068 in the re-vaccinations which are only possible on a large scale during outbreaks of small-pox, such as occurred in 1904-1905. In Rajshahi the highest results in the last ten years were recorded. Both in this district and in Noakhali and Dinajpur the Civil Surgeons report that the vaccination staff did good all round-work. Those districts which show a decrease on last year's totals are :4 Vaccination in compulsory areas cannot be said to be satisfactory. The special attention of Civil Surgeons will be drawn to the subject. There should be little diffi- culty if the provisions of the Acts are systematically enforced. Vaccine Depôt. 11. The expenditure was Rs. 10,208-2-7. It exceeded that of the previous year by Rs. 681-2-4 and was due to an increase in the estab- lishment and to the purchase of a larger number of calves. 662 calves were vaccinated, and the vaccine was taken from 565. 515,823 capillary tubes were loaded. An epidemic of a catarrhal nature broke out at the end of December, which caused the death of 46 calves. It subsided in a fortnight after careful segregation of the sick. Since November 1904 the depôt has been entirely independent of vaccine obtained from outside sources. By careful selection and strict attention to cleanliness, it is now able to maintain its own supplies with certainty, and the quality of the vaccine is uniform and good. Captain Franklin, I.M.S., who was in charge of the Depôt, reports that Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta and the establishment did excellent work. Cost of the Department. 12. The total cost of the Department was Rs. 80,103-5-8, of which Rs. 59,000 was paid from Provincial Funds, Rs. 14,057 from District and Local Board Funds, Rs.4,889 from Municipal Funds. General. 13. Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 (prohibiting inoculation) was adopted in the province in October 1905. Its provisions do not appear to have yet been enforced in Cachar and Sylhet, where the practice is still said to be prevalent. Railway Vaccination. Eastern Bengal State Railway. (1) Operations were carried on under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bose. Five Medical Officers, 6 Civil Hospital Assist- ants, and 1 lincensed vaccinator were employed. 460 operations were performed, of which 226 were primary with la successful percentage of 92.65. Lanoline vaccine from Darjeeling was used. Nine cases of small-pox occurred at Saidpur and Parbatipur stations. Assam-Bengal Railway. (2) Of 281 operations 125 were primary and 156 re-vaccinations, giving a percent- age of 88.8 and 87.82, respectively. Vaccination on tea gardens. 15,143 primary operations were performed on tea gardens, of which 94 per cent. proved successful. E. C.

VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE PROVINCE OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. 1. Introductory.2 6. Percentage of successful operations. In the Vaccine Department the percentage of successful primary operations was 98.57 and of re-vaccination 71.66. The percentages in vaccination performed by dispensary agents were 97.89 and 86.08, respectively. 7. Different methods of Vaccination. (1) Vaccination direct from the calf, which was hitherto practised in the Eastern Bengal districts has been discontinued except in the Dinajpur, Rajshahi and Bogra districts. It was expensive and cumbersome, and was found to be no longer necessary, as glycerinated vaccine is being supplied in its place. (2) Arm-to-arm vaccination with humanised vaccine has also been discontinued in compulsory areas, and arrangements are being made to discontinue the practice in rural districts also during the coming year, by supplying the whole province with glycerinated vaccine from the Central Depôt at Shillong. The following table compares the percentage of the operations performed with each kind of vaccine in 1905-1906 and in 1906-1907 :3 In Kamrup in spite of a severe epidemic of cholera, the number of operations increased by 4,000 above the decennial average. Hospital Assistant Mohim Chandra Chaterjee is to be congratulated on successfully vaccinating 750 Mahapurushiyas in. the town of Barpeta. This is the most important success which has yet been gained and it should go a long way towards breaking down opposition. The Civil Surgeon of Darrang gives an interesting table to show the amount of prosection afforded to 13,000 people of the general population, who were examined at the Jail, the Hospital and the Lunatic Asylum. 10,000 had been vaccinated, 700 inoculated, 500 had had smallpox, and 2,000 were unprotected. The Bengal Vaccination Act, V of 1880, is being extended to the Tezpur Municipality. The Civil Surgeons of Sibsagar and Lakhimpur draw attention to the existence of inoculators in the Majuli and North Lakhimpur. Act IV (B.C.) of 1865 (prohibiting inoculation) has been extended to every district in the Assam Valley, and if the inoculators can be traced they should be prosecuted, and if possible, induced to accept official service. 9. Composition and strength of the Inspecting Agency. The scheme combining the Assam with the Eastern Bengal Inspecting Staff into a Provincial Service has been approved by the Local Government and came into force from 1st April 1907. The cadre will be increased by 10 officers, to allow of better supervision in the Assam and Surma Valley districts, and to provide for temporary loss on account of leave and sickness. Hitherto the Inspecting Staff has mostly been recruited from the ranks of the paid or licensed vaccinators. Their educational qualifications, however, are not sufficient to enable them to perform their work efficiently, and as they are usually of many years service when they are selected for promotion, they can rarely serve to qualify for a pension. It has therefore been decided that no vaccinator can be promoted to the Inspecting Staff unless he is below the age of 25 years, and unless he possesses a sufficient knowledge of English to read printed circulars and to compile his Registers. 10. Verification by Inspecting Officers. The percentage of inspections by the Inspecting Staff amounted to 89.29 of the total operations. A circular has recently been issued defining the duties of the Inspecting Staff. The Sub-Inspectors are in future to be held personally responsible for the efficiency of the vaccination work within their circles, and their promotion in the service will depend largely upon their zeal and ability. In the course of the season. they are expected to inspect about 70 4 12. Vaccine Depôt. The expenditure was Rs. 16,858-12-11, showing an increase on that of the previous year of Rs. 6,650-10-4. 948 calves were vaccinated, and vaccine was taken. from 781. 848,408 tubes were loaded. In 1905-1906, the Eastern Bengal districts were supplied with lanoline- vaccine from the Calcutta and Darjeeling depôts. During the year under report these districts were supplied with an equivalent quantity of glycerinated vaccine from the Shillong Depôt. The quality of the vaccine was uniformly reported to be excellent. As has been shown above in paragraph 7, a large increase has been made in the number of operations performed with glycerinated vaccine. Arrangements are being made to supply the whole Province with it during the ensuing season, and to discontinue arm-to-arm and calf-to-arm vaccination. A new operating room is being made in the depôt, with impermeable marble flooring and walls, and the site has been extended so as to allow of the unvaccinated cattle being kept separately from those under operation. Special apparatus is being purchased with which to mix the pulp with the glycerine, and another apparatus for mechanically sucking the mixture up into the capillary tubes. The latter instrument has been designed by Major Entrican, I.M.S. It promises to be exceedingly useful. Thanks are due to Major Green, I.M.S., the Superintendent of the Depôt, to whose careful management and supervision the excellent quality of the vaccine has been due, and to Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta, on whom the burden of its preparation and distribution has fallen. 13. Cost of the Department. The total cost of the Department during the year was Rs. 90,634-12-5, against Rs. 80,103-5-8 of the previous year. Of the former amount Rs. 62,102 was paid from Provincial Funds, Rs.21,845 from Local Funds, Rs. 4,692 from Municipal Funds and Rs. 1,995 by the Manipur State. 14. General. (1) Railway vaccination.

No. 2916. FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL E. C. HARE, I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Shillong, the 4th June 1908. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Triennial Report on Vaccination for the years 1905-1906,1906-1907, and 1907-1908. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, E. C. HARE, Lieut-Col., I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
[Maximum limit2 Mortality from small-pox. 4. The ratio of deaths from small-pox reported during 1907-1908 was .28 per mille of the population. The ratio was highest in Darrang (4.19) and in Kamrup (3.45). In the former district the mortality was due to a severe outbreak of small-pox among some aboriginal tribes who have not yet become accustomed to vaccination : and in the latter district it was due to an epidemic among the Mahapurushiyas, who object to vaccination on religious grounds. The ratios range considerably higher in the Assam Valley districts than in the Eastern Bengal districts, from .35 in Nowgong to .74 in Lakhimpur3 In Eastern Bengal the largest triennial increase is reported from Chittagong (+ 105,373), Noakhali (+ 70,733) and Faridpur (+ 28,374) ; on the other hand, Dacca reports a decrease of 47,000 and Dinajpur of over 7,000. In the Assam and Surma Valleys, Cachar (+ 19,000) is the only district in the plains which has shown a fairly steady increase in the number of operations, and in Darrang, Nowgong, and Sibsagar there has been a distinct and gradual decline. The conditions under which vaccination is carried on in the Assam Valley are more difficult than those which obtain in Eastern Bengal. The sickness and mortality from kála-ázár, cholera and small-pox, tend to disturb the population, and have no doubt had a share in hindering vaccination; and to these may be added the sparseness of the population, and the difficulty of communication. It is, moreover, difficult to obtain competent Assamese Inspectors at the present time, and experienced Bengali Inspectors are very unwilling to leave their own part of the Province. These are probably the main causes of the want of progress in the Assam Valley, and most of them can only be remedied in the course of time. Proposals for making service in the Assam districts more agreeable to the inspecting staff are under consideration. Vaccination in the Hill districts seems to be making satisfactory progress. With the exception of the Lushai Hills and Manipur, the returns of the other districts show a considerable increase in the number of operations during the last triennium : and in the Naga Hills and Chittagong Hill Tracts, the villagers are acquiring the habit of applying for the services of a vaccinator whenever they are threatened with an outbreak of small-pox. The following extracts from the district reports are of interest:4 both in the Barpeta subdivision and in the villages on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. The Civil Surgeon in an interesting note draws attention to the influence which this unvaccinated community exercises over the death-rate from small-pox, and he shows that while in the thanas of Palasbari, Nalbari and Barpeta, the death-rate varies between 4 and 5 per mille, in the neighbouring circles of Rangia and Gauhati, where they are comparatively few in number, the ratio lies between 1 and 2 per mille. In the Darrang, Nowgong, and Sibsagar districts, vaccination has been declining during the last three years. This is probably in part due to the difficulty of obtaining suitable inspecting officers, as those who belong to the Eastern Bengal districts are not acquainted with the language and conditions of life in Assam. Natives of the valley who possess suitable qualifications are not forthcoming, and the few who do enlist require considerable training before their services are of much value. The Civil Surgeons of these districts note that vaccination on tea-gardens is not satisfactory, and state that a circular calling attention to the subject will be issued by the Magistrate at the beginning of the next season. Inoculation is still practised in Lakhimpur, one inoculator having been prosecuted and fined. Composition and strength of the inspecting agency. 9. With a view to increasing the efficiency of the Department, the inspecting staff of the Assam Province was amalgamated with that of Eastern Bengal, and the whole was formed into a graded provincial service. The strength of the cadre was also increased by ten officers, so as to allow one Inspector for each district and one Sub-Inspector for each circle in the plains, and one Sub-Inspector for each district in the hills; also a reserve of four Sub-Inspectors to fill vacancies caused by leave or sickness. These changes were introduced with effect from the 1st April 1907. The pay and grading of the staff remain the same as in Bengal, viz. :5 The Sub-Inspectors are required to inspect 706 He also remarks that in Barpeta, owing to the large number of operations performed by Hospital Assistant Mohim Chandra Chatterjee during the cold weather of 1906-1907, the deaths from small-pox diminished greatly in number, and were practically confined to the first half of the year, only two deaths occurring after the 1st June. Vaccine depôt. 12. As the union of the two portions of the Province occurred at the beginning of the vaccinating season of 1905-1906, temporary arrange- ments were made with the Government of Bengal to allow the Eastern Bengal districts to continue to receive their supplies of vaccine from the Calcutta and Darjeeling depôts, and in the meanwhile, the Shillong vaccine depôt was enlarged sufficiently to supply the whole Province. The details of this work were in the hands of Major Green, I.M.S., to whom thanks are due for the great interest and care which he has taken. His report is most interesting, and from the following notes will be seen the excellent result which he has obtained. (a) Expenditure.7 Some unnecessary wastage of vaccine still takes place, especially in the Assam districts, where the vaccinators in former years were in the habit of obtaining almost unlimited supplies. In Assam, on the average, two individuals are vaccinated from three tubes, while in Eastern Bengal on the average three individuals are vaccinated from two tubes. Major Green points out that, with economy, one tube of vaccine will suffice for six separate insertions, and that an allowance of one tube for each indivi- dual, with a margin of 10 per cent. for wastage, should be ample for the requirements of a district. The quality and virility of the vaccine has been steadily maintained by the careful selection of both calves and vaccine employed to continue the special strain, from which the other calves are vaccinated. By so doing, the vaccine has been maintained unim- paired since November 1904, without the admixture of other foreign strains, and without exhaltation by passages through other animals. When used locally it gives 100% successful results, even after it has been kept for about four months in the depôt, and no loss of efficiency has occurred from the dilution. Complaints were received from many of the districts of failure of the supplies which were despatched from the depôt at the latter end of September and the beginning of October. This complaint has been perennial apparently since the foundation of the depôt, and enquiry has failed to elicit any obvious cause, though it is certain that the vaccine is virile when it is despatched from the depôt. The general opinion is that the failure is connected in some way with the heat of the plains and the difficulty of carrying on operations during the Durga Puja holidays : and most Civil Surgeons consider it advisable to defer the formal opening of the vaccinating season till 1st November, by which time the weather will have become cooler, and the holidays will have ceased. A mechanical contrivance, invented by Major Entrican, I.M.S., has been introduced for filling the tubes with vaccine. It has worked most satisfactorily, and its introduc- tion has been followed by a considerable saving of labour, and by greater cleanliness in filling the tubes. The pulp, however, still has to be mixed with glycerine by hand in a pestle and mortar, as no mechanical machine has yet been invented which acts so effectively. Arrangements for cold storage are being made, which will enable a large reserve of vaccine to be kept in hand for use in the event of the supply of calves failing, or of an epidemic. To meet the necessity for increased accommodation at the depôt, additional stalls for vaccinated calves have been erected. Numerous new out-houses have been built to provide for newly-imported animals, and a new well-lighted operating theatre has also been constructed. Owing to these various improvements, it is now possible to prepare twice as many tubes with less labour than in the previous year. The cost of one tube of vaccine is estimated to be 2.4 pies, of which nearly 1 pie represents the cost of the empty capillary tube, and this cost will be still further reduced to 1.9 pies when tubes of of smaller calibre are introduced. This figure compares very favourably with those of previous years, viz., 4.08 pies in 1905-1906 and 3.9 in 1906-1907. Major Green reports that he has received loyal support from Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta and the staff of the depôt. Cost of Department. 13. The total cost of the Department during the year was Rs. 1,02,095-11-0, against Rs. 90,634-12-5 in 1906-1907 and Rs. 80,103-5-8 in 1905- 1906. The expenditure during 1907-1908 was borne in the following manner :8 14.

Resolution on the Vaccination Report of Eastern Bengal and Assam for the three years ending 1907-1908. Extract from the Proceedings of the Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam in the General Department, No. 5651 M., dated Shillong, the 12th August 1908. READ2 3. In the 47 towns in which vaccination is compulsory, 5,853 infants of a total of 11,222 available for vaccination were successfully vaccinated. In the Dacca Division less than a third of the children were vaccinated. Except in the towns of Madaripur, Faridpur, and Sherpur, vaccination was seriously neglected in all other towns of this Division, and the report does not show how many persons were prose- cuted. The prejudice of parents against their children being vaccinated before the second year of life is assigned as one of the reasons for the poor results. In most of the smaller towns of the Assam Valley Districts, where the Civil Surgeon's influence is felt, the percentage of vaccination was high, specially in Sylhet, Shillong, and Dibrugarh. The Lieutenant-Governor will be glad if the importance of vaccina- tion in towns is impressed on all Civil Surgeons. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor. L. J. KERSHAW, Secretary to Government. E.

No. 4191. FROM MAJOR E. WILKINSON, I.M.S., OFFICIATING SANITARY COMMISSIONER, EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM, MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Shillong, the 31st May 1909. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Vaccination Returns of the Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam for the year 1908-1909, together with my notes thereon. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, E. WILKINSON, Major, I.M.S., Offg. Sanitary Commissioner, Eastern Bengal and Assam.
VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE PROVINCE OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1908-1909. 1. Introductory. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Hare, I.M.S., held charge of the Department throughout the year. There was only one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner under this Depatment who was practically unable to help in vaccination work owing to the onerous nature of his other duties. 2. Vaccination agencies. Vaccination was carried on by 1,130 departmental vaccinators, of whom 300 were paid and 830 licensed men. 3. Total number of operations. Excluding secondary operations, 1,449,658 operations were performed during the year, of which 1,349,379 were primary and 100,279 were revaccination cases. The total consists of:2 7. Different methods of vaccination. A sufficient quantity of glycerinated vaccine was regularly supplied to all Civil Surgeons, and there was thus no necessity to use vaccine taken direct from calves or from the arms of vaccinated subjects. Rajshahi is the only district in which operations with humanized vaccine were reported. 8. Vaccination work in different districts. Of the 28 districts in the Province, 10 districts reported an increase on the previous year's work. The increase was most marked in the districts of Mymensingh, Faridpur, Bakar- ganj, Dinajpur and Rangpur, each of which reported over 11,000 operations in excess of the figures of the previous year. The only districts which reported decreases worthy of notice were Noakhali the Naga Hills and Tippera. The increase in the number of operations performed in the five districts mentioned above was due mainly to the greater activity displayed in the presence of small-pox during the last quarter of the year. The Civil Surgeon, Bakarganj, reports that but for this activity, which was responsible for 22,252 operations in excess of those performed during the corresponding period of the previous year, there would actually have been a deficit. The Civil Surgeon also reports that from some of the affected localities &quot;almost frantic letters were received begging for vaccinators to be sent.&quot; It is also stated that a much larger number of operations might have been performed in this district, if more vaccinators were available. The Civil Surgeon, Mymensingh, who reports an increase of 26,300 operations, attributes the large increase to the good work done by the inspect- ing staff and to the assistance rendered by the District Magistrate and the Subdivisional Officers. As this district was too heavy a charge for one Inspector, an additional In- spector was sanctioned and appointed during the year under report. The Civil Surgeon, Faridpur, reports that owing to the prevalence of small-pox, certain villages, which never before accepted vaccination, were thoroughly protected during the year. The increase in this district amounted to 22,500 operations. In Noakhali, there was a decrease of nearly 4,000 operations. The Civil Surgeon considers that in spite of this decrease, the result of the year's work was very satisfac- tory and creditable to the staff, 31,351 infants having been successfully vaccinated, against 27,270 in the year 1907-1908. There was also a decrease of nearly 4,000 operations in the Naga Hills. This, the Civil Surgeon reports, was due to an experimental change in the class of vaccinators. Hitherto Assamese vaccinators had been employed in these tracts ; but during the year under report they were replaced by Angami Nagas, specially trained for the purpose, as it was thought that the tribes would have less objection to them. It appears, however, that the other tribes regard the Angamis as foreigners quite as much as they did the Assamese, and are more ready to quarrel with them. In fact it is stated that the people prefer the Assamese to the Angamis. The matter is being enquired into. In the Kamrup district some further progress was made in overcoming the opposi- tion towards vaccination displayed by the Mahapurushyas. Two thousand and ninety of this sect were vaccinated, against 1,612 in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon reports that Inspector Bishambar Das appears to have won them over to the advantage of the operation. Considerable opposition is met with in the Darrang district also, from which the highest death-rate from small-pox was reported. In some villages, chiefly inhabited by Cacharis, the people will not accept vaccination for fear of incurring the displeasure of the goddess Basanta. The Deputy Commissioner rendered some assistance in over- coming the opposition. The Civil Surgeon, Lakhimpur, reports that considerable progress was made during the year under report in extending vaccination amongst the Muttocks, who have strong objections to vaccination, and also amongst the Miri tribes, 1,289 of whom were vaccinated for the first time. The Civil Surgeon circulated the small-pox pamphlet issued by the Satkar Samiti of Dibrugarh, the contents of which were personally explained to the villagers by the staff. He considers that the free circulation of this pamphlet would in some measure remove opposition to vaccination. The matter is under the consideration of this department. There was an increase of 8,538 operations in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. This was principally due to the temporary entertainment during the vaccination season of one temporary Sub Inspector and five temporary vaccinators. The temporary establishment was employed principally in areas in which vaccination had not been
3 previously introduced, viz., in the Bhoi country, towards Nongstoin, and in the villages round about Nongpoh on the Gauhati-Shillong road. The question of the revision of the staff employed in these Hills is under consideration. 9. Composition and strength of the inspecting staff. The provincial cadre was strengthened by one third-grade Inspector for employment as an additional Inspector in the Mymensingh district, which was too heavy a charge for one man. The inspecting officer employed by the Dacca Municipality was during the year transferred as a Sub-Inspector, second grade, on the provincial staff. A temporary Sub-Inspector on Rs. 30 was also sanctioned by Government for six months for the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, to supervise the introduction of vaccination into certain areas in which the operation has not previously been practised. Except for the abovementioned additions the cadre remained the same as in the previous year. 10. Verification by Inspecting officers. The percentage of inspection work done by the Indian inspecting officers during the year was 87.54, against 91.14 in the previous year. The decrease is no doubt due to the staff being busily engaged during the last quarter of the year, in organizing measures for the suppression of outbreaks of small-pox. The Civil Surgeon verified 4.18 of the total number of persons vaccinated. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was unable to devote any time to inspection, as he was busily engaged on special work during the year. II. Vaccination in compulsory areas. Of 12,227 infants available for vaccination, 8,176, or over 66% were successfully vaccinated, against a percentage of 52 in the year 1907-1908. As compared with the previous year, there was a marked improvement in the Dacca and Rajshahi Divisions. The City of Dacca still continues to show very bad results. The Civil Surgeon reports that owing to the prevalence of measles and chicken-pox the work of infant vaccination was interfered with. He has again brought to notice the opposition to the operation in the first year of life. Except in the town of Kishorganj, all the Municipalities in the Mymensingh district show better results than those of the previous year. The Civil Surgeon, Mymensingh, also reports that the people object to have their children vaccinated during the first year of life. In Tangail, the Subdivisional Officer rendered great assistance and fined 17 persons for neglect of vaccination. Excellent work continues to be done in two towns of the Faridpur district (Faridpur and Madaripur), where 63 prosecutions were instituted with 17 convictions. There were also 36 prosecu- tions in the Chittagong district. Comilla in the Tippera district showed bad results. This the Civil Surgeon reports to be due to the prevalence of measles and infantile dysentery, which rendered the children unfit for vaccination. Of the towns in the Assam districts, Silchar and Sibsagar showed unsatisfactory results. 12. Vaccine Depôt. The total cost of the depôt was Rs. 20,826-2-4, which is Rs. 1,252-15-10 in excess of the year 1907-1908. The total number of tubes loaded was 1,866,457, against 1,583,122 in the previous year, showing an increase of 283,335 tubes. The cost per tube was 2.1 pies against 2.4 in the year 1907-1908. Eight hundred and seventy-eight calves were vaccinated and vaccine was taken from 751. The quality of the vaccine was, on the whole, reported to be excellent. The Superintendent has again reported highly on the care and interest taken by Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Dutta. 13. Cost of the Department. The total cost of the Department during the year was Rs. 1,10,613-11-11, against Rs. 1,02,095-11-0 in the previous year. Of the former amount, Rs. 87,241-2-11 was paid from Provincial Funds, Rs. 16,977-5-1 from Local Funds, Rs. 4,786-3-11 from Municipal Funds and Rs. 1,609-0-0 by the Manipur State. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was 1 anna 3 pies. The cost was the same in 1907-1908. 14. General. Of 325 operations performed on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, 168 were primary and 157 revaccination cases. The percentages of success obtained were 85.71 and 72.61, respectively.
4 On the tea gardens, 19,858 operations were reported to have been performed, 19,051 primary and 807 revaccination cases. The percentages of success were 96.56 and 95.04, respectively. These figures include operations performed by garden agencies on the gardens in the Jalpaiguri Duars, where the work was transferred during the year from the licensed vaccinators to the tea garden medical officers. No operations were reported to have been performed by garden agencies in the Chittagong district. The work of vaccinating prisoners in the jails of the Province, which was hitherto performed by the Municipal vaccinators, was, during the year, transferred to the Hospital Assistants in charge. Of 948 primary and 3,736 revaccination operations performed by these officers, 91.77% and 71.38% were reported to be successful. E. WILKINSON, Major, I. M. S., Offig.

Enclosures.NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF EASTERN BENGAL AND ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1909-1910. 1. Introductory. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Hare, I.M.S., held charge of the Department from the 1st April 1909 to 8th May 1909, Captain C. A. Gourlay, I.M.S., from the 9th to 14th May 1909, and Major E. Wilkinson, I.M.S., from 16th May 1909 to the end of the year. The office of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was held by Captain C. A. Gourlay, I.M.S., from 1st April 1909 to 5th November 1909, and by Captain T. C. McCombie Young, I.M.S., from 6th November to the end of the year. 2. Vaccination agencies. Vaccination was carried on by 1,164 departmental vaccinators, of whom 292 were paid and 872 licensed. 3. Total number of operations. Excluding 7,547 secondary operations, 1,457,054 operations (which represent the total number of persons vaccinated) were performed during the year, of which 1,294,151 were primary and 162,903 revaccination cases. The total consists of :2 8. Vaccination work in different districts. Excluding the two Native States of Manipur and Hill Tippera, there was an increase in the number of operations performed in 12 districts as compared with the year 1908-1909. The districts of Dinajpur (48,609), Rangpur (7,873), Malda (7,708), and Bogra (4,130) which, with the exception of Malda, suffered badly from small-pox, showed the most marked increases. These, as was to be expected, were for the most part in revaccination cases. There was also an increase of 971 operations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts due to the extension of vaccination in the Miani Reserve, which was opened up during the year. In the Lakhimpur district further progress was made in the extension of vaccina- tion among the Muttocks and Miris. Two vaccinators were also deputed to Barduari and the Abor Hills and they successfully operated on 938 Nagas and 1,127 Abors. This is the first time that Nagas and Abors living outside the Inner Line have been vaccinated. Of the 15 districts which showed decreases during 1909-1910, as compared with the year 1908-1909, the deficit was most noticeable in the districts of Pabna (18,068), the Khasi and Jaintia Hills (12,473), Faridpur (9,195), and Sylhet (7,528). With the exception of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the decreases are reported to be due to the unusual prevalence of malarial fever during the year under report, which rendered many children unfit for the operation. No explanation has been offered by the Civil Surgeon, Khasi and Jaintia Hills, for the large deficit in his district. It may, however, be partly accounted for by the fact that 5 additional temporary vaccinators were employed during the season 1908-1909. In the Tippera district progress was made in extending vaccination among the Gurushatyas and the Ferazi Muhammadans, who are strong opponents of vaccination. 9. Composition and strength of the inspecting staff. There was no change in the strength or composition of the inspecting staff during the year under report. 10. Verification by Inspecting officers. The percentage of inspection work done by the subordinate inspecting staff during the year was 91.89 against 87.54 in 1908-1909. Civil Surgeons verified 51,397 or 3 56 of the total number of persons vaccinated. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner inspected 472 or .03 of the total number of persons vaccinated. As in the previous year this officer's time was fully occupied in special work, and he was unable to devote much attention to vaccination. 11. Vaccination in compulsory areas. Of 12,728 infants under one year said to be available for vaccination, 6,935 or 54 per cent. were successfully vaccinated during the year, against 8,176 or 66 per cent. during the year 1908-1909. The city of Dacca showed considerable improvement, the percentage of infants vaccinated to total number said to be available being double that of the previous year. The Kishorganj, Bajitpur and Muktagacha Municipalities of the Mymensingh district showed very poor results. The Civil Surgeon reports that in all these towns there is much prejudice on the part of parents to children being vaccinated during the first year of life, which prosecution failed to overcome. In the town of Muktagacha however a large number of children over one year of age were vaccinated through the influence of the local Sub-Assistant Surgeon. The towns of Faridpur and Madari- pur continue to show good results, other towns showing satisfactory work being Pirojpur, Chandpur, Noakhali, Bogra, English Bazar, Malda, Nawabganj, Dhubri and Jorhat. In Comilla and Silchar the results are still unsatisfactory. The town of Gauhati also showed poor results, while there has been considerable improvement in Sibsagar. 12. Vaccine Depôt. The total cost of the depôt was Rs. 21,651-5-7 or Rs. 825-3-3 in excess of that in the year 1908-1909 The total number of tubes loaded was 2,145,024 as compared with 1,866,457 in the previous year, the cost per tube being 2.1 pies, which is the same as in the previous year. Altogether 940 calves were vaccinated and vaccine was taken from 787. The quality of the vaccine was reported to be good, except that supplied by the depôt during the month of October and the early part of November,
3 when many failures were reported. The Superintendent of the Depôt reports that in view of a possible extreme epidemic of small-pox rather more vaccine than usual was prepared in August, and the distribution of this may have accounted for the failures. It has however been arranged that no vaccine prepared before the 1st September should be distributed during the ensuing season. 13. Cost of the Department. The total cost of the Department during the year was Rs. 1,13,998-15-5 com- pared with Rs. 1,10,613-11 -11 in the previous year. Of the former amount Rs. 90,804-1-7 were paid from Provincial Funds, Rs. 16,214-15-3, from Local Funds, Rs. 5,130-10-7 from Municipal Funds, and Rs. 1,849- 4-0 by the Native States of Manipur and Hill Tippera. The average cost of each successful vaccination was one anna four pies compared with one anna three pies in the previous year. 14. General. 564 vaccination operations were performed on the Eastern Bengal State Railway, of which 229 were primary and 335 revaccinations. The percentages of success were 93.45 and 79.10, respectively. Only three operations were reported to have been performed in the Pahartali workshop of the Assam-Bengal Railway, of which 2 were successful. On the tea gardens, 11,434 vaccination operations were performed by garden agen- cies, of which 9,500 were primary and 1,934 revaccinations. The reported percentages of success were 89.22 and 82.25, respectively. Of 620 primary and 4,082 revaccination operations performed by the Sub-Assistant Surgeons attached to Jails and in Cantonments, 75.80 per cent. and 57 per cent., respec- tively, were reported to be successful.

[Maximum limit2 4. Mortality from small-pox. The provincial ratio of deaths from small-pox (.46) during the last three years was higher than in the preceding period. In 1909-1910 the ratio (.72 ) was nearly double that of the next highest year of this period, owing to a sharp outbreak of the disease in Rangpur (3.45 ), Bogra, Dinajpur and Rajshahi in the Eastern Bengal districts, and in Nowgong.( 3.49 ), Darrang and Kamrup in the Assam Valley. The ratio has now fallen again to .29. It is interesting to note how the mortality from small-pox tends to run in wave lengths of 5 to 6 years, the crest of each wave being reached as soon as a new genera- tion of unprotected individuals has sprung up. Such waves are distinctly traceable in the statistics of Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Bogra and Now- gong. Other similar, but more irregular curves are seen in the statistics of other districts. 5. Dispensary vaccination. In the year 1906-1907, the operations recorded as vaccinated by dispensary agents numbered 25,600. About that time, on the representation of the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet that the practice of reserving special areas for dispensary vaccination was undesirable, the opinion of all Civil Surgeons in the Assam and Surma valleys was taken, as to whether dispensary vaccination should not be limited to operations of emergency, and of those who specially attended the dispensary for the purpose. The general concensus of opinion was in favour of doing so, except in the hill districts and in a few other specified areas. Orders were accordingly issued, and since that date, dispensary vaccination except in the hill districts has practically ceased. The areas which were formerly reserved for dispensary officers have been handed over to the vaccination department and their records have been amalgamated with those of the rest of the muffusil. Dispensary vaccination in the Eastern Bengal districts has never been practised to any large extent; a few hundred cases are reported yearly, chiefly from Malda, Rangpur and Noakhali. 6. Percentage of successful operations. The average percentage of success obtained by officers of the vaccination department during the last three years was for primary operations 97.22 per cent. and for revaccinations 73.67 ; and among dispensary agents 93.07 and 72.46, respectively. 7. Vaccination work in the Districts. Dacca Division3 Chhittagong Divisision. Tippera is the only district in this Division which records an increase in the number of operations of this triennium over the last. The total has steadily risen from 69,000 in 1905-06 to 98,000 in 1910-11. In Noakhali, although there is a decrease of 19,000, the work has on the whole been satisfactory. Chittagong, however, shows a remarkable decrease of 111,412 in the number of operations of the last three years, compared with that of the former period. Last year's operations only numbered 61,000 and there has been a steady decline from 134,000 in 1905-06, with the exception of a slight rise in 1909-10. The decrease of 8,000 which occurred this season has, I consider, been largely due to want of energy on the part of the inspecting staff, and there has also been apparently some diffi- culty in recruiting vaccinators locally, which may have had some share in causing the deficit. A decided effort will have to be made next season to bring the standard back to its original strength. In all the districts of this Division, the Civil Surgeons complain of the difficulty in realizing the vaccinators' fees. In Chittagong they sometimes have to wait 3 or 4 months for them, and then are often unable to realize the full amount due. Rajshahi Division. In four of the districts of this Division a considerable increase is recorded in the number of operations of the past three years, viz., in Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra and Malda, chiefly owing to the impetus given to the work by a sharp outbreak of small-pox in 1909-10. In Rajshahi this year owing to a severe outbreak of small-pox, which was no doubt the remnant of the wave which spread over the Division the previous year, there was a large increase in the number of revaccina- tions. Strong opposition was offered by the Ruffadin Muhammadans, and the Civil Surgeon comments on the great assistance which was given him by the sub- divisional officers in overcoming it. In Pabna, the decrease of 20,000 operations which occurred in 1909-10 owing to a severe outbreak of malaria, has been more than made good, and credit is due to the staff; and in Malda though there is a decrease of 5,600 in the number of operations, compared with the number recorded last year, the total is still higher than any year of past decade (except 1909-10). The Civil Surgeon considers the decrease is partly due to emigration from the villages which were destroyed by the Ganges, and partly to a change in jurisdiction by which some villages were transferred to Purnia. Assam Valley Districts4 borne out by facts, for the percentage of mortality from small-pox in the Garo Hills is rising after several years of practical immunity. This year the ratio (.13) is higher than any year since 1905. Efforts should, on no account, be relaxed, for not only is a new and unprotected population of infants coming into existence, but the immunity among those already vaccinated is gradually in course of time becoming weaker. In the Khasi and Jaintia Hills the increase of 12,800 operations on the total of the last triennial period is due to the work of an additional temporary staff which was employed in 1908-09. The Khasis are badly vaccina- ted, compared with the neighbouring Garos, and outbreaks of small-pox among them are of frequent occurrence. The question of permanently increasing the staff is under consideration. In the Naga Hills, the Civil Surgeon remarks on the influence of the Subdivisional Officer of Mokakchang in inducing the people to accept vaccination. Surma Valley districts. Cachar records a fall of nearly 11,000 operations during the triennium; and though slight, it has been persistent each year. This district was formerly reputed to be one of the best vaccinated districts in the province. In Sylhet also there has been a fall of over 60,000 on the last triennium. 8. Strength and composition of the inspecting staff. There are 24 Inspectors and 63 Sub-Inspectors on the staff, including 4 supernumeraries. Since the last report a second Inspector has been appointed to Mymensingh, as it was impossible for one officer to supervise a district containing nearly four and a half million inhabitants. The Sub-Inspectors also have received two additions to their number by the appointment of an officer to the new Subdivi- sion of Gopalganj in the Faridpur district, and by the addition of the Municipal Inspector of Dacca city to the provincial cadre. 9. Verification of operations by inspecting officers. In the last report, attention was drawn to the impossibility of the Deputy Sani- tary Commissioner's carrying out the nominal programme of his work, which is to visit every district and to inspect a sample of each officer's work. The condi- tion has become even more pronounced now than it was then. His time has been very largely taken up with special public health enquiries and with the Provincial Laboratory, and this portion of his work has consequently fallen seriously into arrears. He only succeeded in inspecting 592 operations in the course of the year, of which 405 were in the subdivisions of Mymensingh. The Civil Surgeons' inspec- tions in many of the Eastern Bengal districts are also becoming more difficult to make each year, and are practically confined to the vicinity of their head-quarters and to the larger centres of their districts. In Bakarganj, for example, the inspections of primary operations were particularly bad (.3 in 1908-1909, .09 in 1909-1910 and .02 in 1910-1911). In Mymensingh, Chit- tagong, Tippera and Rangpur, they were under 1 per cent. and in only 7 districts, Noakhali, Bogra, Malda, Nowgong, Naga Hills, Garo Hills and Manipur were they over 10 per cent. The percentage of inspections by the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner and Civil Surgeons is only 3.96 of the operations of the last three years (167,000) which is quite insufficient for the purpose. A proposal to appoint special inspecting officers for vaccination and vital statistics will be submitted shortly. The subordinate staff inspected 89.93 per cent. of primary operations, and 66.26 per cent. of re-vaccinations, during the last three years. In the Assam districts the ratio is lower than in the Eastern Bengal districts, probably owing to the comparatively scattered condition of the villages, and the sparseness of the population. 10. Vaccination in compulsory areas. Of 12,926 infants under one year, said to be available for vaccination during 1910-1911, 7,133 or 55 per cent. were successfully vaccinated. In the city of Dacca and in the municipalities of the Mymensingh district, com- pulsory vaccination cannot be said to have been successful. In Dacca city, out of 2,360 children available, only 248 were vaccinated within the year. This condition is not, I consider, due to want of effort on the part of the staff, for not only were the ordinary notices in &quot; Schedule E &quot; issued by the police habitually to everybody re- porting a birth ; but 822 notices requiring vaccination within 15 days, under the &quot; first schedule&quot; were issued on defaulters ; 43 persons were prosecuted and 20 of these were convicted and fined. The children ultimately get vaccinated ; but their parents object to the performance of the operation during the first year of life.
5 Again in Netrokona, Jamalpur, Sherpur and Tangail, in the Mymensingh district, only half the available children were vaccinated, and in Bajitpur only27 out of 274. In the other divisions of Eastern Bengal, vaccination in compulsary areas has, on the whole, been distinctly good. In 7 of 25 towns practically every available child was vac- cinated and in several of the others the percentage was high , and it is evident that considerable attention has been paid to municipal vaccination in the Eastern Bengal districts. In the Assam Valley and Surma Valley districts, however , the results have not been so successful. In Shillong practically every child was vaccinated and in Dibrugarh the number was high, but in Gauhati, Tezpur, Dhubri and the other towns, the results have not been satisfactory. A proposal has been submitted to Government to substitute Bengal Act V of 1880 into the Assam and Surma Valleys in place of Imperial Act XIII of 1880, which will give greater uniformity of working, and will, it is hoped, lead to greater efficiency. 11. Vaccine Depôt. In the report for 1907-1908 it was pointed out that the Shillong Vaccine Depôt, which was originally constructed to supply the needs of the old Assam province,had been enlarged to provide for the Eastern Bengal districts as well. This depôt has served its purpose for many years past and it has prepared excellent vaccine ; but it is no longer in accordance with modern requirements. The stalls and arrangements for housing the calves while under operation are not satisfactory. There is no apparatus for cold storage which,according to modenrn ideas is essential to obtaining a reliable vaccine, and although a small extra supply is kept in stock for emergencies, it is not as large as it ought to be, to provide for use in the event of an epidemic breaking out among the calves, or of a failure in their supply. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner has recently visited the Vaccine Depôt at Belgaum, which is one of; the most modern and recently constructed in India, to study the lines on which a similar depôt may be built for this province. The annual report on the Depôt has been written by Major Innes, I.M.S , the present Civil Surgeon of Shillong ; but the work of the two past seasons has been supervised by Major MacLeod, to whom thanks are due for the great care and trouble which he has taken in its management, and to whom its success has been in great part due. Expenditure. The cost of the Depôt during the past three years is shown in the accompanying statement:6 means universal, and the cause of the trouble was not obvious, as the origin and history of every specimen of vaccine are carefully recorded and samples of it are tested on children before despatch to the plains. Every precaution which can be ? is taken to maintain the quality of the vaccine; but the only effective way of ensuring that the vaccine is always of uniform character is to store it for a considerable time in ice, to destroy the extraneous organisms. 12. Cost of the Department. The cost of the Department for the year was Rs. 1,16,702, of which Rs. 93,068 was paid from Provincial Funds, Rs. 16,762 from District and Local Boards funds, Rs. 5,418 from Municipal funds and Rs. 1,454 by native states. 13.

Published at the BENGAL SECRETARIAT BOOK DEPÔT, Writers' Buildings, Calcutta OFFICIAL AGENTS. In India VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE DISTRICT OF EASTERN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. INTRODUCTORY. 1. The present report only deals with vaccination in the Eastern Bengal districts as the report of the Assam and Surma Valley districts is being written by the Sanitary Commissioner of Assam. VACCINATION AGENCIES. 2. Eight hundred and fifty-four departmental vaccinators were employed, of whom 54 were paid and 800 licensed, and their work was supervised by Inspecting officers. TOTAL NUMBER OF OPERATIONS. 3. One million two hundred and eight thousand and twenty-four opera- tions were performed during the year, of which 1,114,342 were primary and 93,682 re-vaccination. Of this total, 1,200,175 operations were performed by officers of the Vaccine Department, 2,596 by Dispensary Agencies, 1,917 by Tea Garden Agencies, and 3,326 by the Jail Department. There was an increase of 89,233 operations performed by the Vaccine Department as compared with the number of the previous year. DEATHS FROM SMALL-POX. 4. Six thousand one hundred and thirty-four deaths from small-pox were recorded (.36 per mille) against 7,393 (.42) in 1910-11. The death-rate was highest in Mymensingh (.81). In 1910-11 Mymensingh also recorded highest death-rate (.98) A high ratio is also reported from Dacca (.35 . In other districts it varied from .14 to .01, the lowest being in Malda and Rangpur. DISPENSARY VACCINATION. 5. Two thousand five hundred and ninty-six dispensary operations were performed during the year. Dispensary vaccination is not much practised in the Eastern Bengal district. PERCENTAGE OF SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS. 6. In the Vaccine Department the percentage of successful primary operations was 96.14 and of re-vaccination operations 76.30.
( 2 ) METHODS OF VACCINATION. 7. Glycerinated vaccine manufactured by the Shillong vaccine depôt was used exclusively in all districts. An interesting attempt was made to overcome a certain failure of the vaccine which was frequently reported from the districts in the early part of each season October and November). The failure was usually supposed to be either connected in some way with the change of temperature during transit between the depôt in Shillong and the plains, or with the vaccinators being out of practice in their work, though the evidence put forward in support of either theory was not very clear. However, in 1910-11 the complaints of failure became more emphatic and more frequent than usual, and it was thought that in addition to the deteriorating effects of change of temperature during transit, some alteration might also be taking place in the inherent vitality of the strains, especially as it had been realized for some years past that. the manufacture of the vaccine was being carried on under conditions which were rather favourable to a break-down. Captain T. C. McCombie Young, I.M.S., was sent to visit the dopôt of the Bombay Government at Belgaum, and he drew up a very interesting and valuable report on the whole subject which was submitted to Government with proposals for the reconstruction of the depôt on the most modern lines. He also recommended certain measures for immediate adoption which it was thought would increase the vitality of the vaccine. These were carried out by him with most beneficial results. The vaccine made from this revivified strain was put up in the usual way into capillary tubes with the addition of 2 parts of 50 per cent. glycerine and water, and it was then packed in &quot; Thermos&quot; flasks to preserve the original temperature at which it had been manufactured during transit to the plains and until it was actually required by the vaccinators for use. The results were reported to be very satisfactory ; but further investigations were put a stop to by the break-up of the province. VACCINATION WORK IN THE DISTRICTS. 8. Out of 15 districts, 11 reported an increase on the previous year's work. The increase was most marked in the following districts:( 3 ) VACCINATION IN COMPULSARY AREAS. 11. Of 11,904 infants in compulsory areas under one year available for vaccination, 6,597 or 55.41 per cert. were successfully vaccinated. The percen- tage in the city of Dacca has risen from 10.51 in the preceding year to 14.68. This is in great part due to the vigorous efforts which were mode to deal with an outbreak of small-pox which occurred there in the early part of the year. One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven notices were issued under the Act requiring vaccination within fifteen days, and 130 people wore reported for prosecution for not complying with the order. Most of them were fined, VACCINE DEPÔT. 12. Vaccine for the Eastern Bengal districts was supplied from the Shillong depôt. Remarks on the working of the institution will be found in the Assam report; but I should like to record here the excellent work which has always been done by Sub Assistant Surgeon Kamal Chandra Datta, who has held charge of the depôt throughout the period of existence of the province. COST OF THE DEPARTMENT (EXCLUDING THE COST OF THE VACCINE). 13. The total cost of the department during the year was Rs. 54,652-1-3 against Rs. 53,618-3-5 in the previous year. Of the former amount, Rs. 49,793-14-7 were paid from the Provincial Funds, Rs. 4,296-1-8 from Municipal Funds and Rs. 562-1 from Native States. The average cost of each successful case was 9 pies. E.
