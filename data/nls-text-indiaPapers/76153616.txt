BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE. Preface2 The Board of Examiners' report is as follows:3 Out of 14,386 prosecutions under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 186 animals were sent to the College Infirmary by the trying Magistrates. The students received much practical instructions from these patients. 19. The fees realised for treatment, shoeing, etc., were Rs. 18,608-4-9 and the cost of feeding was Rs. 39,770-15-3. The latter sum included the cost of treatment (which includes feeding) of light horse chargers and Govern- ment animals for which no fees are charged; also keep of the College riding ponies, ambulance horses and breeding and draft cattle. The excessive cost of feeding was due to the price of grain and fodder remaining high through- out the year. An increase in the hospital charges for horses and dog patients was sanctioned by Government with effect from 1st April 1921. 20. Fodder Crops.4 4.

MacGregor held charge of the office of Superintendent of this Department from the beginning of the year till 22nd November 1920, when he went on combined leave for six months I then remained in charge of the Department, in addition to my duties, as Second Imperial Officer, Bengal Veterinary College, from the 22nd to 27th idem. when I went on combined leave for twenty-seven days, and Colonel Smith acted for me here in addition to his own duties, as Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. I returned to duty on the forenoon of the 3rd January 1921 and continued in charge for the remainder of the year under report. 2. During the period of eight months in which Mr. MacGregor held charge he was on tour for forty-seven days, travelled 3,098 miles by rail, 168 by road and 358 by steamer, inspected the Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Serampore, Rajshahi, Puthia, Natore, Naogaon, Rangpur, Kalimpong, Jalpai- guri, Ghoom, Kurseong, Burdwan, Siliguri and Suri, veterinary assistants, Kalimpong Homes Farm and Agriculture Farm, Rangpur, consulted and advised local bodies as to the best means of improving veterinary matters in their districts, and selected bulls for certain District Boards in this province. 3. During the three months in which I remained in charge I was on tour for fifteen days, travelled 953 miles by rail, 45 by road and 208 by steamer. In the course of these tours I checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff at Dacca, Serampore, Chinsurah, Suri and Bankura. In the last-mentioned district, the District Board had passed orders to the veterinary assistant to realize the cost of serum from the raiyats for inoculation, and I impressed upon the Chairman the necessity of withdraw- ing this order as it was contrary to the policy of Government and would greatly retard the humanitarian work of this Department. I also inspected the site selected for the veterinary hospital at Dacca, and attended the horse and cattle-show held there in February last. I acted as examiner at the annual examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College held in March last. At the close of this month I was deputed to Ranchi to learn the method of double instantaneous inoculation against rinderpest, as this method might be made use of in Bengal, for Government, Calcutta Corporation and municipal cattle. 4. Babu Jnanendra Nath Mitra, Glanders Inspector, acted as Deputy Superintendent of this Department, during the absence on leave of the permanent incumbent Babu Sarat Chandra Paul, from 1st April till 2nd July 1920. The latter worked only for four days, and then again went on sick leave for seven months from the 7th July 1920. No substitute was appointed during the first two months of his leave. Maulvi M. S. Chow- dhury, Veterinary Inspector, Presidency Division, acted as Deputy Superin- tendent during Mr. Paul's absence, from the 7th September 1920 to 6th February 1921.
9 These officers between them toured altogether for ninety days, and travelled 5,313 miles by rail, 137 by road and 696 by steamer. They inspected the work of almost all the veterinary assistants in the subdivisions and also at the important district headquarters of this Presidency. 5. A Second Deputy Superintendent for the Eastern Bengal divisions was sanctioned by Government in July 1920, and Babu Nripendra Nath Majumdar, Veterinary Inspector, Chittagong, was appointed to fill that post with headquarters at Dacca. He joined there on the forenoon of the 20th September 1920, and inspected the work of the veterinary assistants of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Mymensingh, Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Jamalpur and Sarisabari, in the Chittagong and Dacca divisions. He also attended a conference of Veterinary Inspectors held at Calcutta in September 1920, and in March last went with me to Ranchi to learn the double instantaneous method of inoculation against rinderpest. He was out on tour for 48 days and travelled 1,295 miles by rail, 56 by road and 696 by steamer. 6. Of the four veterinary assistants who were away on Military duty, two, viz., S. L. Sen and J. N. Sen, returned to this Department on the com- pletion of their term there. The services of the remaining two, viz., A. M. Ghose and U. N. Sarkar, have been placed at the disposal of the Bagdad Government for the period of one year. Part I.3 11. Anthrax.4 encountered in the advanced districts of this province, the beneficial result of the practice is gradually overcoming the prejudices of the people. In some of the outlying districts, there is still much apathy and prejudice amongst the cultivators, and veterinary assistants have experienced great difficulty in getting the system of treatment adopted. 26. The death-rate amongst the inoculated was small, being only 1.06 per cent. for the whole province. 27. A sum of Rs. 27,239-12 was paid during the year to the Imperial Bacteriologist at Mukteswar on account of the cost of sera and vaccines. Table IV. 28. Table IV shows the number of animals treated by the veterinary assistants on tour. 29. Eighty-three veterinary assistants were at work in the mufassal. of whom 58 were purely itinerant and 25 both itinerant and stationary. These men visited 12,756 villages as against 12,831 in the preceding year, and treated 69,584 cases as against 58,761. The increase is satisfactory, showing the growth of popularity of veterinary work in the mufassal. It would have been much greater had the Department been adequately staffed throughout the Presidency and had substitutes been available to relieve men while absent on leave. 30. The Co-operative Department appointed a veterinary assistant as their inspector to work amongst the 44 milk-societies in the Baraset subdivision of the 24-Parganas district. This assistant, who joined his appointment in November last, treated 209 cases and inoculated 413 head of cattle against rinderpest. He also gave necessary instructions to the members of the societies regarding improvement in cattle-breeding, veteri- nary hygiene and prevention of cattle diseases, etc. Table V. 31. Table V shows in detail the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the province. 32. There were 35 dispensaries at the close of the previous year. Two, viz., one at Serajganj and another at Bagerhat, were added during the year, thus bringing the total number of such institutions to 37. 33. The total number of animals treated during the year both as in and out-patients amounted to 41,074 as against 44,747 in the preceding year. The decrease is partly due to less number of cases being treated at the Sodepur Pinjrapole, and partly to certain dispensaries remaining closed on account of the absence on leave of the veterinary assistants when no substi- tutes could be given to relieve them. 34. It is much to be regretted that nothing has yet been done at Pabna towards the construction of suitable dispensary buildings with accommoda- tion for indoor patients, alt hough land was acquired for the purpose some rive or six years ago. 35. The District Board of Rajshahi have at last taken up the question of erection of a veterinary hospital at the headquarters station of that district, and plans have already been drawn up and an estimate sanctioned for the same. 36. Land has also been acquired for veterinary dispensary with assistant's quarters at Naogaon during the year under report. 37. The need for suitable veterinary dispensary buildings at Thakur- gaon and Balurghat subdivisions of the Dinajpur district is being keenly felt. The District Board have expressed their inability to allot funds for the purpose. But the veterinary inspector reports that good many horse and cattle fairs are held in these subdivisions, and if the proprietors of these lairs be requested to raise a nominal subscription of 6 pies or one anna for each head of animal sold, a sum of Rs. 3,000 to 6,000 can be had by this means. This will not affect any one in particular, benefit the subscribers and at the same time do immense good to the raiyats.
5 38. Proposals are on foot at Bogra to acquire a piece of land for the extension of the veterinary hospital there. 39. The Deputy Commissioner of Darjeeling has selected a site for the erection of a regular veterinary dispensary with veterinary assistant's quarters there. The question of constructing a dispensary at Kalimpong is under the consideration of the authorities of the Darjeeling Improvement Fund. 40. The District Board of Jalpaiguri are considering the proposal of erecting an outdoor dispensary at Domohani with quarters for an itinerant veterinary assistant. 41. The District Board of Rangpur have resolved to build quarters and office for the itinerant veterinary assistant at Sadar inside the hospital compound, and to extend the dispensary room for the stationary assistant there. They have also selected a site for a dispensary and quarters for the veterinary assistant at Kurigram. 42. It is very gratifying to note that the villagers of Dimla in Rangpur have come forward with an offer of 3 bighas of land plus a sum of Rs. 1,000 for the construction of a veterinary dispensary with assistant's quarters there, and the District Board have accepted the proposal and resolved to establish a veterinary dispensary at an early date. This, I believe, is the first instance in which raiyats and cultivators have come forward with an offer of money and land for establishing a veterinary dispensary at their own place for the treatment and improvement of their cattle. If the example set by the Dimla people is followed in other parts of the province, it will not be long before the Department is fully developed. 43. The dispensary at Noakhali has been removed to Sonapur owing to the erosion of the river Megna. 44. A sum of Rs. 100 has been granted by the Commissioner of the Burdwan Division for walling up the dispensary compound at Chinsura. A we'll attached to the Cox's Bazar dispensary has also been sanctioned by the District Board, Chittagong. 45. The District Board, Bakarganj, have constructed a serum cellar at Barisal at a cost of Rs. 1,200 according to the plan sent by this office, and the District Board, Mymensingh, have also consented to construct a similar cellar at Mymensingh. This will remove the inconvenience and delay in the trans- mission of serum from Belgaclua. 46. The dispensary at Midnapore will be opened as soon as we are in a position to post an experienced man there. 47. The District Boards of Murshidabad, Jessore and 24-Parganas have not yet seen their way to construct hospitals there, although the need for such institutions is keenly felt in those places. 48. The construction of a dispensary at Tangail is pending the selection of a site by the local authorities. The major portion of the cost will be borne by the six annas estate. Santosh. 49. The Narainganj Municipality have not yet taken up the construc- tion of a dispensary building there, which was blown down in 1919. Part III.6 53. Babu Santosh Kumar Ghatak of French Baraset presented a good bull to the Chinsura dispensary, and a Montgomery cross young bull was presented by Babu Brajo Thakur of Nawabganj to the Rangpur hospital. Babu Nabodhip Ch. Adhikary, Talukdar of Raipur, also presented a bull of medium quality to the Veterinary Dispensary, Noakhali. Fairs and Shows. 54. Tables XIII and XIV show the particulars of horse and cattle fairs held during the year. 55. As usual, all these were visited either by the Divisional Inspectors or local veterinary assistants. 56. Lantern lectures were delivered at Suri and Faridpur. Bull-breeding and Rearing Farms and Depots. 57. As reported in the previous years there are only two such farms in this province, one at Kalimpong and the other at Rangpur. The former is managed by the St. Andrew's Colonial Homes and the latter by the Agricul- tural Department. Table IX shows the working thereof. 58. Kalimpong.7 viz., S. C. Gupta, accepted an appointment under the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Bengal. Thus, including the five vacancies shown in the last year's report and nine new posts sanctioned, there were altogether 21 vacan- cies to be filled up during the year. Of these 14 could be filled. Ten with new graduates received from the College, and the remaining four were filled up by two old graduates, viz., N. N. Sur and J. N. Roy, who had resigned previously, but were re-employed, and by two veterinary assistants released from Military duty. 64. Deputy Superintendent Babu S. C. Paul was unfortunately absent on sick leave for the greater part of the year, but was fit to return to duty at the beginning of February. For the first six months of his absence Babu J. N. Mitter, Inspector, Glanders Department, acted as Deputy Super- intendent. For the last three months Veterinary Inspector Maulvi M. S. Chowdhury officiated. Veterinary Inspector Babu N. N. Majumdar was appointed Deputy Superintendent to fill the new post created. He commenced his duties with headquarters at Dacca in September 1920. He shapes well as a Deputy Superintendent, but it is too soon for any definite results to be seen. This new post should materially improve the work in the eastern half of the province. The number of veterinary assistants employed has increased considerably in the last few years, and the extra supervision was much required. 65. InspectorsTABLE II.

The number of stud bulls kept by Government and local bodies increased from 124 in the previous year to 132 in the year under report. Of these 65 are the property of local bodies. 7. Two new dispensaries were established during the year, thus bringing the total number of institutions to 37, whilst it is satisfactory to note that the establishment of more dispensaries are under contemplation. The number of patients treated at these dispensaries was 41,074 as against 44,747 in the previous year. The decrease is reported to be due partly to a smaller number of animals being treated at the Sodepur Pinjrapole and partly to certain dispensaries remaining closed on account of the absence on leave of the veterinary assistants when no substitutes were available. 8. During the year under report the administrative control of the Civil Veterinary Department was transferred from the Director of Agriculture to the Principal, Bengal Veterinary College, he being the senior veterinary officer in the province, and he was made the head of the Civil Veterinary Department with the designation " Veterinary Adviser to the Government of Bengal." During the year revised scales of pay were sanctioned both for the Imperial and Provincial Veterinary Services. 9. The work of the Deputy Superintendents, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Veterinary Inspectors and the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College was satisfactory. The Government (Ministry of Agriculture and Public Works) have much pleasure in acknowledging the valuable services of Colonel Smith and in recording their appreciation of the work done by Messrs. P. J. Kerr and A. D. MacGregor. By order of the Government of Bengal (Ministry of Agriculture and Public Works), J. A. L. SWAN, Secretary to the Government of Bengal. No. 3474.
