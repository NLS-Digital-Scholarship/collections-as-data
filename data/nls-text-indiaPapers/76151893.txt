The number of infectious cases was considerable, viz., 20 cases of glanders, 5 of tetanus, 92 of rinderpest, 6 of surra (4 horses and 2 cattle), 42 of eczema contagiosa, 3 of strangles, 2 of influenza, 32 of distemper, 18 of rabies, and 4 of tuberculosis. These afforded ample opportunities to the students of study- ing most of the infectious diseases. I would draw special attention to the cases of tuberculosis, as I have observed in foreign journals a quotation from the Annual Report of the Imperial Bacteriologist in which he remarks:( 4 ) THE HOSTEL. 19. All the students (five Muhammadans, two Christians, one Eurasian, and thirty-two Hindus) lived in the hostel, which affords a comfortable and healthy home. Separate arrangements were made for their meals. As the students have had to experience some inconvenience in messing for want of sufficient space, additional accommodation is to be given, for which Rs. 100 has been provided in the next year's budget. The Medical Officer attended regularly. A proposal was made for the supply of medicines gratis to the students from the North-Suburban Hospital at a monthly cost to Government of Rs. 13, which, though approved by the Com- mittee of Management, was not sanctioned by Government. INSTEUCTION TO DEIVEES OF THE ABMY COMMISSAEIAT TRANSPORT CORPS. 20. Arrangements were made for the instruction of 30 intelligent Com- missariat transport drivers in nursing sick animals during the vacation time; but they have not come nor have I heard from the Commissariat Officer when they may be expected. LECTUEES TO AGRICULTUEAL STUDENTS OF SIBPUR COLLEGE. 21. A course of 48 lectures on Veterinary Hygeine, Cattle-breeding and Rearing was delivered by Mr. E. H. Brand, the Senior Lecturer, to nine students of the Agricultural classes at the Civil Engineering College, Sibpur,
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, For the year 1900-1901. 1. The Department has made steady progress during the year. New dispensaries have been opened, others are under consideration. The demand for Veterinary Assistants is greater than ever. The thirteen new graduates have got appointments already. As I have been unable to supply men in several instances, I would urge the need of applying early for their services. It has again been necessary to utilise the senior students and the lecturers to meet emergencies. 2. The distribution of the men is shown below :( 6 ) 4. Motihari.( 7 ) Medicines, of which there is a sufficient stock, were distributed free. Six new instruments were purchased during the year. The dispensary is in good order and progressing well. 8. Musaffarpur.( 8 ) is Rs. 51. The expenditure of the year under report (Rs. 757-2) was, however, met from the subscriptions (Rs. 481-2) realised during the year and from the balance of the last year, which chiefly consisted of donations, which will not be renewed (Table O). The balance in hand and the monthly subscriptions now expected to be collected will hardly meet the present expenses of the institution. The Subdivisional Officers of Deoghur, Godda, Jamtara, Pakour, and Rajmahal were asked to raise subscriptions for the maintenance of the dispensary, so as to make it a general one for the district, but the people were not agreeable to the proposal, and would not pay for a Veterinary Institution. It is a pity that, in spite of all efforts, the zamindars, most of whom do not reside in the subdivision, and their raiyats could not realize the value of the scheme, with the exception of Ray Camalas- wari Prosad Sing Bahadur of Monghyr, zamindar of Tappa Belpatta, who came forward with a handsome donation of Rs. 1,207 in cash and wood and other materials for the construction of a Veterinary Hospital at Dumka. This is now under construction, and is expected to be completed before the rains. It would be a graceful acknowledgment of the zamindar's public spirit to name the dispensary after him. The Subdivisional Officer suggests that a better-qualified Veterinary Assistant be sent to Dumka, who will take an interest in his work, and show the people what good can be done. Unless Government agrees to help the institution with a suitable grant, it must soon be closed. The Veterinary Assistant treated 592 out-patients at the dispensary, of which the results are given in Table L (a). He visited several villages, where he treated 1,301 animals, of which 911 were cured and relieved and 890 died (Table N). The Subdivisional Officer remarks that he doubts very much the accuracy of the figures. The dispensary was visited by Mr. Charles Engel, Lecturer, Bengal Veterinary College. His report shows that the outbreak of glanders, which necessitated the destruction of a number of ponies, seems to have prejudiced the natives against the Veterinary Assistant. Some have refused to subscribe, while others, although they have their names in the subscription book, do not pay. This man will be transferred or his services dispensed with as soon as the necessary means (medicines and instruments) are provided to afford another man the means of pushing the work with reasonable chance of success. 11. Tippera.( 9 ) I inspected this dispensary and found it flourshing. The success of the institution is due to the interest taken in it by Raja Baikantha Nath De, Bahadur, the Vice-Chairman, and other influential gentlemen. 13. Chittagong.( 10 ) provide for up-keep would come in. Purnea is a great cattle country. The Khagra Fair is reported to be larger than Sonepur or Sitamarhi. There are not less than 200 horses and ponies in and about Purnea itself. 22. Bhagalpur.( 11 ) copies of the Bengali translation of Colonel Hallen's Manual of Cattle Diseases in India were supplied to these places for distribution among the cattle-owners. Veterinary assistance was also supplied to the Presidency and Alipur Central Jails at the request of the Superintendents. CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IN THE CALCUTTA GOWKHANAS. 28. A strong effort was made during the year by the Chairman to combat the contagious diseases which are practically always present among the animals, and which, through them, are carried all over the city. I met a Committee at the southern gowkhana and gave advice as to the reconstruction of stables, and an arrangement was made whereby all infectious and serious cases, including "mange," were to be sent at once to the Belgachia Veterinary College for isolation and treatment, as there are no means of safely isolating cattle in the gowkhanas. The Veterinary Assistant was directed to pick out all these cases, and an ambulance from the College was permanently stationed in the southern gowhhana for the transport of the worst cases. By this arrangement the duties of the Veterinary Assistant, who could not have dressed and treated all his cases under the old system, became greatly lightened. It was also arranged that all newly-purchased ponies should be malleinized and kept separate, so that they, at any rate, should be free from glanders. The cattle were all inoculated with anti-rinderpest serum. The Superintendent of the gowkhana was relieved of his duties, and another man appointed. Unfortunately this officer did not send the cases to Belgachia, as arranged between the Chairman and myself, and I ascertained that the newly-purchased and malleinized ponies had been mixed up with the old stock, which is notoriously infected with glanders. Hence an arrangement which promised well for the eradication of infectious disease from the gow- khanas has fallen to pieces. This is a matter for regret, since the animals of the Municipal gowkhanas constitute, in my opinion, an ever-present danger to the property of the horse and cattle-owners of Calcutta, and indirectly to the Army. EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 29. Government has taken so much interest in preventive inoculation, that it will not be out of place to say a few words about the use of serum in Bengal from the practical point of view. Of the two methods of using the serum, one is called the single or plain serum method, and consists in injecting a certain quantity under the skin. It causes no discomfort and no reaction, and the animal can be worked immediately before and immediately after the operation without evil results. The preven- tive effect takes places at once. The duration of the complete immunity is not very long, but it generally outlasts an outbreak; when the immunity begins to weaken, it may yet be sufficient to prevent the death of an animal, though it may not be sufficient to prevent the attack. The people in Bengal raise only those objections to its application which conservative and cautious cattle owners would offer in any country ; and I think, these objections will be overcome in time, especially, if the number of serious attacks in the inoculated can be further reduced, as I think they can be with greater knowledge of dosage, etc. The double method consists in injecting a calculated quantity of serum into one side and a small quantity of virulent rinderpest blood into the other. This inoculation sets up rinderpest in a more or less modified form, the duration of the immunity it gives rise to being proportional to the virulence of the reaction. Thus, it is possible to confer an immunity that will last for years. This method is undoubtedly preferable in the laboratory, and possibly for field work anywhere else than in Bengal. But there are difficulties and dangers in the way of its practical use in this Province which demand very serious consideration:( 12 ) temperatures in large herds requires a large staff, or so much delay as to greatly discount the value of the method. (4) A very serious danger in Bengal is that connected with double infection, which means that the blood of a rinderpest patient may carry the germs of other diseases. (5) There is the financial loss, as it affects the owners of animals through cows aborting and losing their milk, and bullocks being thrown out of work for an appreciable time, as must happen if the immunity which the double method confers is to be durable. Supposing these objections can be overcome, it will still remain to be proved that the average Veterinary Assistant can be trusted to make the necessary calculations, upon which the double method is based, with sufficient accuracy and care to create the exact amount of reaction which is desired. In my opinion, the objections to the double method veto its use in this Province. The plain serum method is not free from objection, owing to the comparatively short time it acts; but at any rate, it is a simple, and safe appli- cation, well suited for use by a Veterinary Assistant. It is not my intention to use the double method, unless ordered to do so ; but every opportunity has been taken to push the single method. 30. Experiments were carried out in Chittagong, Raniganj, Kanti, and in the Calcutta Municipal gowkhanas as shown below : ( 13 ) Noakhali.( 14 ) 36. Various complaints were received about some of the bulls: some have been impotent,( 15 ) STAFF. 46. Mr. E. Burke supervised the routine duties of my office, besides doing his ordinary work during my absence on leave in Darjeeling and my deputa- tion to Port Blair. He has been awarded the diploma of a graduate of the Bengal Veterinary College by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor. Messrs. Brand and Engel carried out their duties as usual. They have been made graduates of the college. The results of the teaching of the two outside lecturers were somewhat adversely criticised by the Examiners; but these lecturers, being doctors, were greatly handicapped by their ignorance of veterinary medicine and surgery. I have been able to recommend three of my graduates for higher appoint- ments: thus, Mr. D. K. Dey has been given a lectureship, and Messrs. S. K. Mitter and S. K. Biswas, Inspectorships. Hitherto we have relied on the Bombay College for men to fill these appointments: in future, our own men will get them. Applications for men to fill higher appointments in Madras have been received, but all my students found employment as soon as they passed, and no one is at present available for other Provinces. Only a few years ago the examination for the " two years' standard" had to be of a specially mild description to allow a percentage of Bengali students to pass. This year the pass for the final diploma examination is 100 per cent., and we not only fill our higher grades with our own men, but we are also asked to fill those of another Province.
