?NATIONAL   LEPROSY   FUND. Memorandum on the Report of the Leprosy Commissioners, as prepared by a Special Committee, appointed for the purpose, and endorsed or annotated by Members of the Executive Committee. Your Committee, having been instructed to consider and report to you upon the publication of the Report of the Leprosy Commissioners in India in 1890-1, beg to submit the following considerations.:- I. They desire to place on record their sense of the ability with which the Commissioners con- ducted their investigations while in India, and of the comprehensive and valuable nature of their report. II. The conclusions at which the Commissioners arrived have been summarised by them at the end of their report as follows-the evidence upon which these conclusions rest being dis- played at length in the earlier pages of the Report:- " (1) Leprosy is a disease sui generis; it is not a form of syphilis or tuberculosis, but has striking tiological analogies with the latter." " (2) Leprosy is not diffused by hereditary trans- mission (), and for this reason, and the established amount of sterility among lepers, the disease has a natural tendency to die out." " (3)   Though  in a scientific classification of diseases leprosy must be regarded as contagious and also inoculable (), yet the extent to which it is propa- gated by these means is exceedingly small." () ()   Vide page 9.
4 LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT. "(4) Leprosy is not directly originated by the use of any particular article of food, nor by any climatic or telluric conditions, nor by insanitary surround- ings; neither does it peculiarly affect any race or caste." "(5) Leprosy is indirectly influenced by insanitary surroundings, such as poverty, bad food, or deficient drainage or ventilation, for these by causing a predisposition, increase the suscepti- bility of the individual to the disease." "(6) Leprosy in the great majority of cases originates de novo, that is, from a sequence or concurrence of causes and conditions, dealt with in the report, and which are related to each other in ways at present imperfectly known." III. Thirdly, the Commissioners having been instructed to report upon the practical measures to be taken for the control or restriction of the disease in India, have suggested the regulation of Lepers and Leprosy by means of by-laws framed by the various Municipalities, upon which point they write as follows:- (a) "The Commission are of opinion that the sale of articles of food and drink by Lepers should be prohibited, and that they should be prevented from practising prostitution, and from following such occupations as those of barber and washerman, which concern the food, drink and clothing of the people generally, quite apart from the dread of a possible infection." (b) "The Commission consider that the best policy in dealing with the concentration of lepers in towns and cities is to discourage it, and to this end would suggest that municipal authorities be em- powered to pass by-laws preventing vagrants suffering from leprosy from begging in or frequenting places of public resort, or using public conveyances." (c) "The large Presidency Towns and the capitals of provinces in many cases already possess leper asylums, which might be enlarged by municipal funds or private subscriptions. Asylums should
LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT.                     5 be built near towns where they do not already exist, and the authorities should have the power of ordering lepers infringing the regulations either to return to their homes or to enter an asylum." (d) " Competent medical authority should always be consulted before action is taken under such by- laws." IV.   Upon   the   afore-mentioned   conclusions   of   the Commissioners, numbered  1, 2, 3, 4, 5  and 6, your Committee offer the following remarks:- They accept Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5. They desire to express their disagreement with the concluding words of No. 3- "That the extent to which leprosy is propagated by contagion and inoculation is exceedingly small,"- not being satisfied with the evidence offered by the Commissioners for this opinion. They cannot  concur  in  the views expressed  in No. 6,-namely that (3) "Leprosy in the majority of cases originates de novo, that is, from a sequence or concurrence of causes and conditions, dealt with in the report, and which are related to each other in ways at present imperfectly known,"- being of opinion that the evidence adduced in the report does not justify such conclusions. V. The Commissioners, in the section of their Report entitled " Practical Suggestions," p. 452-7, as also in other parts of the Report, have expressed opinions   strongly   adverse   to (3)   Vide page 9.
6                     LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' RERORT. compulsory   segregation,   either   complete   or partial.    For instance, they say on p. 258:- "No legislation is called for on the lines either of segregation or of interdiction of marriages with lepers." And on p. 453- "For India complete compulsory segregation may be considered to be absolutely impracticable. Neither do the conclusions given before as to the nature of the disease justify any recommendation for absolute segregation." And on p. 454- "It is impossible for the same reasons to advise compulsory partial isolation. Voluntary isola- tion is therefore the only .measure left for con- sideration." And on p. 456- "In no case would the Commissioners suggest an Imperial Act, especially directed against lepers as such." And again on p. 456- (4) "In conclusion, the Commissioners believe, from the considerations and arguments adduced in the foregoing report, that neither compulsory nor voluntary segregation would at present effectually stamp out the disease, or even markedly diminish the leper population, under the existing conditions of life in India." Your Committee, having already expressed their inability to accept the reasoning, upon which the Commis- sioners have based the above conclusions, are equally unable to accept the corollary that segregation in any case of leprosy in India is either impracticable or undesirable. They entertain a precisely opposite opinion, and would be sorry if the Government of India were encouraged by the  Report of the (4)   Vide page 9.
LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT.                   7 Commissioners to refrain from taking the necessary steps in the direction of such segregation of lepers as may be found possible. Their opinions upon segregation are in accord with those expressed in the following extract from a memorandum by Dr. Vandyke Carter:- MODES OF SEGREGATION.   I. " By erecting plain asylums at certain centres, each of which would be a refuge common to several districts; and a place of detention, under due management and supervision." II. "By founding Leper Colonies, or village communities mainly of the affected, who, while allowed more liberty of movement, should yet be prevented from mingling with the peasantry around: hence still the need of strict supervision. Many spots would thus serve- such as deserted forts, decayed villages, and places now waste yet not far from other sources of supply, or not without near resources easily resuscitated." III. 'By requiring the strict isolation of leprous subjects retained in their homes at express wish of friends. Suitable separate lodgment would be indispensable; unsuitable shelter is even now sometimes supplied. Joining of such home-isolation with more public measures should not be overlooked; for to it experience in Norway seems to point as a means essential to complete success within a moderate period of time; and in India it would have to be still more largely resorted to." IV. "For carrying out the above, in addition to funds, legisla- tive authority is needed to take up the vagrant sick, to remove the sorely diseased who is insufficiently guarded at home, and at times to enforce continued isolation of the infected until medical sanction of liberty be granted." VI. Reserving their opinions as expressed in the fore- going paragraph and extract, your Committee give a general approval to the minor re- commendations of the Commissioners, numbered above as (a) (b) (c) (d), for the regulation of lepers and leprosy in India, which they consider might with advantage be carried out; though

LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT.                     9 Independent or Dissentient opinions, etc., expressed by Members of the Special Committee and of the Executive Committee. (1) "Leprosy is not diffused by hereditary  transmission."    I do not think that this is proven.-J. FAYRER. (2) "Contagious   and   also   inoculable."     This   is   also   un- certain.-J. FAYRER. (3) "I understand the Commissioners to mean by the expression "de novo" in reference to the origin of Leprosy that they believe that the disease may begin independently of personal contagion and in con- nection with climatic and dietetic causes. In that belief I entirely share. I also agree in the main with the rest of the statements in the Commissioners' Report to which exception has been taken in our Committee. I feel convinced that if Leprosy be con- tagious at all it depends but to an almost infinitesimal extent upon contagion for its spread."-JONATHAN HUTCHINSON, LL.D., F.R.S. Concurred in by J.  FAYRER. (4) "I am in agreement generally with the recommenda- tions of the Commission respecting voluntary isolation, and the issue of Municipal By-Laws regulating the habits of Lepers. I know of no trustworthy evidence to prove that a leper in any community is a source of greater danger than is a consumptive patient, and I know that a person suffering from Syphilis is a real and very positive source of danger anywhere. It would therefore be absurd on the face of it to adopt stringent laws for the leper, and to let the Syphilitic person go free. "The intelligent layman now imagines that because bacilli are an essential feature of Leprosy, therefore the disease must be readily contagious. This is simply quite contrary to fact. The same thing holds good exactly for consumption, and for some other disorders in which microbes play a part. "I think a well-empowered and vigorously supported Government Medical Executive officer should be appointed in every large town, and in certain districts,
10                   LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT. to supervise the leprous populations and report regularly upon them. It should be his business to see that the local regulations are fully carried out, and on his requisition only should any action be taken when necessary. "Suitable asylums should be provided, and those now existing be sufficiently enlarged to meet the needs that will arise under suitable by-laws. "The project of Leper-farms is, I think, a good one. More than this is, I believe, not within any practical scheme for amending the condition of lepers, and for diminishing the spread of the malady."-DYCE DUCKWORTH, M.D., LL.D. Concurred in by J. FAYRER. (4) "I am strongly in favour of the maintainance (by Government or otherwise) of voluntary Homes for Lepers, but do not believe that segregation would effect anything in diminishing the prevalence of the disease. Compulsory segregation would I think involve in- justice, and entail much social misery. I believe that our Commissioners' Report well expresses not alone the opinions of those who have signed it, but, in a general way, those of the educated classes of the present day throughout India."-JONATHAN HUTCHINSON, LLD., F.R.S. Concurred in by J. FAYRER. "I think the Report a most valuable and excellent one, agreeing generally with the remarks of the Committee. I concur in the objections made by Sir D. DUCKWORTH and Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have also noted two remarks, which I do not consider can be accepted as proven. "But on the whole I regard the Report as most excellent, and, if the recommendations are acted on, one which will prove of the greatest benefit to the population of India. When Leprosy disappears, it will do so as a result of improved hygienic and social conditions. "In the meantime all that is possible-as suggested in the Report-to be done, should be done to ameliorate the condition of the sufferers, and I am glad to find that coercive measures of segregation, or wild fear of contagion, are not contemplated."-J. FAYRER.
LEPROSY COMMISSIONERS' REPORT.                   11 We, the undersigned Members of the Executive Committee of the National Leprosy Fund, desire to express our approval of the Commissioners' Report, which we regard as a very careful record of well-observed important facts. We concur with their suggestions of "the practical measures to be taken for the control or the restriction of the disease in India." We dissent from the opinion expressed in the body of the Report of the Special Committee on the subject of the Contagion of Leprosy, and from the re- commendations founded on that opinion. We believe that the evidence of the spread of Leprosy by contagion is not sufficient to justify the compulsory segregation of Lepers, though the institution of Homes in which they may voluntarily reside may be very earnestly advised. And we are of opinion that, although an unusual susceptibility of Leprosy may be transmitted by inheri- tance, and the children of Lepers may be more than others liable to the disease if living in the conditions in which it generally occurs, this does not supply reason sufficient for prohibiting the marriage of the Leprous.

?INTRODUCTION.  IN April 1889 Father Damien de Veuster died of leprosy at Molokai. Born in Belgium, he had left his native country sixteen years before, and from that time had devoted himself to the relief of the Hawaiian lepers. His martyrdom did not appeal in vain to humanity, and a Committee was at once formed in England to consider the best way of perpetuating his memory. The first meeting of this Committee was held at Marlborough House on June 17th, 1889, under the presidency of H. R. H. the Prince of Wales. An Executive Committee was next nominated, which, at a meeting on June 30th, resolved on the erection of a memorial to Father Damien at Molokai, the formation of a fund for indigent British lepers in the United Kingdom, the endowment of two Leprosy Studentships, and finally the appointment of an Indian Leprosy Commission. Subscriptions were raised, and the sum collected was further increased at a dinner, on January 13th, 1890, at the Htel Mtropole. The chair was taken by H. R. H the Prince of Wales, who, in proposing the toast of the evening, gave an account of the National Leprosy Fund and invited further subscrip- tions.
viii                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Subsequently a letter was received from the Gov- ernment of India expressing their willingness to sub- scribe to the fund, and to assist by appointing two Indian delegates to act with the British Commis- sioners, and by facilitating in every way the collection of evidence by the Commission throughout India. Three Commissioners were appointed by the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Executive Committee of the National Leprosy Fund respectively. A special Committee was also formed to prepare instructions for the Leprosy Com- mission. In accordance with these instructions the Commissioners left London on October 23rd, 1890, and arrived on November 17th at Bombay, where they were met by the Indian representatives. A full account of the further proceedings of the Commission will be found in the diary. It only remains to record the great interest shown in the work of the Commission and the invaluable assistance afforded by Their Excellencies the Viceroy of India, and the Governors of Bombay and Madras, by Their Honours the Lieutenant-Governors of Bengal, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and the Punjab, and by the Chief Commissioners of the Central Provinces, Assam, and Burma. For help in carrying out the more technical part of the work special thanks are due to Dr. Rice, Sur- geon-General with the Government of India, and to
?Introduction. ix Drs. Pinkerton and De Fabeck, Surgeons-General with the Governments of Bombay and Madras re- spectively. Finally, the Commissioners must express their appreciation of the great kindness shown them throughout the country by the Civil Surgeons and Missionaries, who spared no trouble in rendering every possible assistance. To the Managers of the Railway Companies also the sincere thanks of the Commission are due for their unfailing courtesy. Method of Working. The following plan of procedure was agreed upon. The first aim of the Commissioners was to acquaint themselves with the features of the disease as it ap- pears in the Empire, directing their attention more to tiological factors than to purely clinical aspects. This could only be done by travelling from centre to centre, and from asylum to asylum, and personally enquiring into the histories of as large a number of lepers as possible. It was, therefore, decided to take full advantage of the cold season, and to spend about five months in examining asylums and lepers in vari- ous localities. Subsequently the Commissioners were to assemble at some hill station in order to sup- plement their enquiries by pathological and bacte- riological researches. Numerous   places   were   visited,   and   over   two
x               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: thousand lepers were personally examined with a view to eliciting certain data as to heredity, conta- gion, and other points in the tiology of the disease. This portion of the enquiry occupied exactly five months, and the remainder of the time was devoted to bacteriological investigations at Simla, where the Indian Government had built a laboratory for the use of the Commission. Questions were also sent through the Office of the Surgeon General with the Government of India to all Civil Surgeons with a view to obtaining their per- sonal opinions, and gaining information regarding the distribution and spread of the disease and allied general questions The Report. The report is thus divided into two chief parts. In the first the results of the enquiry by the Commis- sion while travelling will be considered; the second part will give an account of their laboratory work. The first chapter will contain a short diary, and this will be followed by a description of the asylums and districts visited, the number of lepers seen, and other statistical information. Details of the distribu- tion and spread of leprosy and its relation to soil, climate, race, and other conditions will next be dis- cussed, while the following two chapters will treat of the all-important questions of heredity and con- tagion.
?Introduction.                                xi The sixth chapter will be devoted to such tiolo- gical points as food, syphilis, and defective hygiene. A brief summary of the various methods of treatment hitherto employed, and the deductions based on the enquiry of the Commissioners, will conclude the re- port. In an appendix an account of the pathological and experimental work done at Simla and Almora will be given.
?GENERAL REMARKS. THE ordinary clinical aspects of leprosy are too well known to require notice here. It will be sufficient to state that in India, as in other parts of the world, three forms of leprosy are met with, the tuberculated, the ansthetic, and the mixed. In the first the skin is primarily invaded by the leprous growth, afterwards the mucous membranes and viscera. In the second form the lesions occur chiefly in the peripheral nerves, while the third is simply a combination of the other two forms. It has been suggested by some observers that tuberculated and ansthetic leprosy are distinct diseases. That they are one and the same may be inferred from the fact that tubercu- lated leprosy is nearly always associated in its later course with ansthesia, thus giving rise to mixed leprosy, and also from the fact that the same bacillus is found in the two forms. Fur- ther, Gerlach1 has shown by a series of elaborate dissections in a case of ansthetic leprosy, that the primary growth takes place in the skin around the peripheral ends of the nerves, ex- tending afterwards up the branches to the main trunks. The onset of the disease would thus appear to be the same in each variety. The following table shows the number of cases and the percentage of each form of leprosy observed by the Commission in the various places visited. These figures agree very nearly with those worked out by Vandyke Carter for Bombay.

The age of the patient and the duration of the disease were noted in nearly every case of leprosy examined by the Com- mission. The patient's age at the onset of the disease was thus easily calculated, and the results are given in Table II arranged in quinquennial periods. It will be seen from this table that most persons became
xvi Report of the Leprosy Commission: lepers between the ages of twenty-six and thirty, the next most frequent time of onset was from twenty-one to twenty-five years of age, then from sixteen to twenty. From such a table it would appear that leprosy most commonly begins between the ages of sixteen and thirty, in other words, in early adult life. These figures again closely agree with those given by Van- dyke Carter.2 However a difference does exist. For accord- ing to his table 4.7 per cent. acquired the disease before the age of ten, whereas the Commissioners found that according to the information they obtained, about double that percentage were attacked before the age mentioned.

This table does not materially differ from the last one, for it was remarked by the Commission that most of the lepers examined by them had been afflicted for several years.

It was thought, however, that some conclusions might be drawn from those cases in which the disease began before the age of ten, for up to this time females are not secluded. b2
xx                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: These have been therefore arranged in Table IV, and it will be seen that up to five years of age the sexes were nearly equal, there being 28 males and 21 females. From five to ten, however, the proportion of males attacked increased, and there are shown to be 95 males to 56 females. TABLE IV.

Statistics of the total duration of a leper's life can only be obtained from asylums where accurate records are kept of the dates of onset of the disease, and of death. It may, however, be mentioned that Danielssen and Boeck have worked out the mean duration of tuberculated leprosy as nine and a half years, and that of ansthetic leprosy as eighteen and a half years. An analysis of the figures of the Trinidad Asylum, extending over some eighteen years, showed the average duration of tuberculated leprosy to be a little under nine years, while that of ansthetic leprosy was about twelve years. It is only fair to state that all the deaths in the Asylum were reckoned, whereas Danielssen and Boeck excluded certain cases in which they considered that death was due to some intercurrent disease. In estimating the value of census and other returns, it was thought that some information would be gained, if the Com- mission were able to form an idea of the percentage of errors
xxii              REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: in diagnosis made by native enumerators and others entrusted with reporting or collecting cases of leprosy. In each place visited a record was therefore kept of all negative and doubtful cases appearing amongst the patients collected for examination as lepers. Table V gives the number of negative cases, with short notes of their nature. All doubtful cases have been omitted, for nothing can be argued from them. Two percen- tages of errors have been worked out, one for all the places visited, and the other for those places only where no leper asy- lum existed. It is at once evident that the latter is the fairer percentage to adopt, for in these places the diagnostic powers of native police, hospital assistants and others of the class from which the census enumerators would be taken, are chiefly relied on, while in places with a leper asylum the inmates come under the notice of the Civil Surgeon, or at any rate of some qualified medical man, so that spurious cases are more likely to be detected. The difference in the figures is suffi- ciently obvious, the percentage of errors being 5 for all the places visited, against 95 for localities with no leper asylum. These probably are the most reliable figures obtainable from the data at hand, and it will readily be seen that if a deduction be made, say, of a tenth of all the lepers returned for India, a not inappreciable diminution in the estimated leper population will result.

There is no doubt that it may occur either in lepers or in otherwise healthy subjects. When in the latter, however, it nearly always attacks the little toe of one or other foot. In lepers, on the contrary, it may attack any toe or even finger. The following case seen by the Commission at the Matoonga Leper Asylum, Bombay, is typi- cal. A Hindu boy, aged ten years, had suffered from mixed leprosy for three and a half years. On examination the little toe of the left foot was found to be enlarged, the outline convex and the skin thickened and completely ansthetic. There was a furrow all round the base of the toe. On the plantar, inner and outer aspects, this extended nearly half through the toe, but was shallower on the dorsum. There was a small ulcer on the plantar surface. The toe could be freely moved about, the bone having been absorbed. The skin beyond the furrow was thickened and somewhat painful. Many of the symptoms of this condition suggest a trophic nerve lesion, but the lesions of ainhum are so comparatively mild that little opportunity occurs for post mortem dissection of the nerves supplying the affected toe or finger. The occur- rence of ainhum in any individual should, however, always suggest a most careful examination for ansthesia and other leprous symptoms. Probably few diseases have been so profitable to charlatans as leprosy. While travelling the Commission met with several instances of the credulity of patients in this respect. The acknowledged incurability of the disease, in spite of the atten- tion it has attracted for so many centuries, is no obstacle to the unfortunate leper, who will often spend all his substance on some hakim or other pretender who has promised to restore him to health. The subject of palliative treatment will be considered in another place.

REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION. CHAPTER  I. Diary of the  Commission. THE English members of  the Commission left London, October 23rd, 1890, arrived at Bombay, November 17th, and remained, here with the two Indian delegates until Novem- ber 26th. November 20th.-The Commissioners visited the Matoonga Leper Asylum, accompanied by Surgeon-Major K. R. Kirtikar and Dr. Choksy, the Medical Superintendent of the Asylum, to both of whom they are greatly indebted for much valuable assistance. November 22nd.-The Trombay Leper Asylum, in the neighbourhood of Bombay, was inspected, the above gentlemen again kindly acting as guides. November 25th.-A visit was paid to the Dharmsala, a building in the city set apart for indigent lepers. November 26th.-The Commission then left for Poona, where, on November 28th, they examined the lepers at the David Sassoon Infirm Asylum. November 29th.-Proceeding thence to Belgaum, the two Asylums were visited, Surgeon-Major J. P. Greany assisting the Commission. B
2 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: November 30th.-Returning to Poona they went over the leper ward at the Yerrowda Central Prison. Accepting a most courteous invitation from the Govern- ment of His Highness the Nizam, the Commissioners proceed- ed to Hyderabad, where they stayed from the 4th to the 10th December. Here they enjoyed the liberal hospitality of Sur- geon-Major E. Lawrie, who spared no trouble in assisting them in every possible manner. The Commissioners consider it their pleasant duty once more to give expression to their deep sense of gratitude for all the kindness received while guests at Hyderabad. Lepers were examined at the hospital and the house of Abdul Gafur, a charitable native gentleman who offers alms and food to the infirm on certain specified days of the week. Lepers from the Central Gaol and from among the native troops were also seen. December 12th.-From the 12th to the 14th of December the large Asylum at Madras occupied the entire attention of the Commissioners. Surgeon-Major H. D. Cook, under whose direction the Asylum is placed, rendered invaluable ser- vices to the Commission not only during their stay at Madras, but at all times. December 15th.-Conjeeveram was next visited and a certain number of lepers who had been collected at the dis- pensary were examined. December 16th.-Travelling through the Madras Presi- dency, Trichinopoly was reached on December 16th, where, assisted by Brigade-Surgeon W. S. Fox, the Commissioners examined the lepers at the Municipal Leper Hospital. December 19th.-Tanjore was visited on the 19th of December where Surgeon-Major H.A. F. Nailer had brought together a number of lepers, who-were seen and interrogated at the Civil Hospital. December 20th.-The Commission arrived at Madura and were here met by Surgeon-Major W. B. Browning, from whom
?Diary of the Commission. 3 they received great kindness and hospitality. As there was no Asylum at Madura, Dr. Browning had collected a large number of lepers from the town and outlying villages and did everything in his power to facilitate the investigations of his guests. In accordance with a suggestion made by the Committee in England, it was now considered advisable that the Com- mission should form two parties, one to travel into Burma, the other to remain in the Peninsula. December 26th.-The latter-G. A. B., A. B., and A. A. K.- proceeded to Calicut, where they examined the lepers at the Asylum. January 1st, 1891.-This part of the Commission arrived at Bangalore, where, accompanied by Brigade-Surgeon T. J. McGann, they saw the lepers at the Asylum. Surgeon C. M. Thompson, by the aid of the local authorities, had assembled a number of lepers at a convenient spot in front of the Bowring Hospital, and these also were examined. January 7th.-Nagpur was reached January 7th. Here Surgeon-Major G. F. A. Harris had made all necessary arrangements and with the aid of the civil authorities a large number of lepers had been assembled at the hospital, and were questioned by the three Commissioners, who take this oppor- tunity of expressing their great obligation to Dr. Harris. January 14th.-A small number of lepers were seen at the Police Hospital of Jubbulpore. Unfortunately a Hindu festival was in progress, and this prevented the collection of many lepers. Surgeon-Major B. Franklin did everything in his power to assist the Commissioners. January 16th.-This section of the Commission visited Naini and Allahabad, where they examined the leprous prison- ers at the Central Gaol, and the inmates of the Naini Leper Asylum. Thence they proceeded to Calcutta. December 31st.-B. N. R. and S. J. T. arrived in Rangoon on the 31st of December, and were met by Surgeon-Major B2
4 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: O. Baker. During their stay at that town they were the guests of Deputy Surgeon-General C. Sibthorpe, to whom they are indebted for much kindness and assistance. At Rangoon the General Hospital and the Central Gaol were visited (January 1st and 2nd). On January 3rd Dr. Sutherland had collected forty cases from the Shway Dagohn Pagoda and the town, and after these had been examined a visit was paid to a leper village in the neighbourhood of Rangoon. January 6th.-These Commissioners crossed the Bay to Moulmein, where lepers were seen at the Gaol, the General Hospital, and the Baptist -Mission House. The Commis- sioners take this opportunity of recording their thanks to Surgeons-Major D. Sinclair, S. H. Dantra, and G. T. Thomas and to Surgeons R. E. S. Davis and J. T. W. Leslie. January 11th.-They proceeded to Mandalay, and notes were taken of patients seen in the Gaol and of others whom the civil authorities had brought together at the General Hospital. January 16th.-Thayetmyo was visited on the 16th and 17th. Here cases had been kindly collected by Surgeon E. P. Frenchman. January 18th.-The enquiries in Burma were concluded by a journey to Prome. Dr. Naylor assembled some cases at the hospital, and subsequently accompanied the Commissioners through the town, where a number of lepers were interrogated at their own houses. Returning to Rangoon these two mem- bers crossed over to Calcutta. January 22nd.-The five members met at Calcutta and at once proceeded to investigate the cases at the Leper Asy. lum. Surgeon-Major D. D. Cunningham, to whom the Com- missioners are greatly indebted for much valuable assistance, placed his laboratory at their disposal, and one of them- A. A. K.-performed a series of animal experiments which will be fully described in the laboratory report. Surgeon J. R. Adie had been appointed by the Bengal Government to assist the Commission during their stay at Calcutta, and his
Diary of the Commission. 5 services were highly appreciated by them. But the greatest thanks are due to Dr. D. D. Cunningham, who freely gave the Commission every information and subsequently assisted them in every possible way. His services all through have been so manifold, that it is quite impossible to enumerate them or even adequately acknowledge them. On leaving Calcutta the Commission once more divided. Two of the members-A. B. and A. A. K.-left Calcutta on February 3rd for Purulia, where, with Surgeon-Major H. W. Hill and the Revd. H. Uffmann, of the German Evan- gelical Lutheran Mission, they examined the lepers at the Asylum and the children at the Orphanage. February 10th.-They saw a number of lepers at the Poor House in Lucknow and thence proceeded to Agra. February 16th.-Accompanied by Surgeon-Major J. Wilcocks, they took notes of the inmates of the Agra Leper Asylum. February 27th.-They then branched off into the Kangra Valley, and after a short enquiry at Kangra, paid a visit to the Asylum at Dharmsala on the 27th of February. March 4th.-They reached Tarn Taran, and, with the assistance of Surgeon T. R. Mulroney and Assistant Surgeon Gulam Mustafa, in charge of the Asylum, they completed their enquiries, and now proceeded to Simla to superintend the construction of the laboratory and commenced bacterio- logical work. April 8th.-From Simla they visited the Asylum at Suba- thu (April 8th to 12th). Here the lepers were examined and microscopical specimens of blood, discharges, &c., prepared, for a description of which reference must be made to the laboratory report. February 3rd to 22nd.-In the meantime a third member of the Commission-S. J. T.-visited Burdwan (February 3rd), Fyzabad (February 6th), and Ajodhya (February 12th), and then met the other Commissioners at Agra on the 16th of
6. REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: February. Surgeon-Major G. Price of Burdwan and Surgeon J. Sykes of Fyzabad gave him every assistance. February 23rd to 25th.-Work was continued at Dehra Dun, where Surgeon-Major G. G. Maclaren gave much valu- able assistance. February 1st.-A third section of the Commission-B. N. R. and G. A. B.-left Calcutta on February 1st for Darjeeling, and here Surgeon-Major J. O'Brien gave them every assist- ance both in collecting lepers and in procuring samples of food eaten by the mixed population of the place. February 5th.-Returning to Calcutta they travelled to Gya, which was reached on February 5th. Here a number of lepers were examined at the Civil Hospital. The Commis- sioners take this opportunity of thanking Surgeon-Major R. D. Murray for his kind help and hospitality. February 10th and 11th.-Benares: Brigade-Surgeon W. R. Hooper had a number of lepers assembled for examina- tion at the Secrole Dispensary. February 13th.-Fyzabad: Here work was done at the Civil Hospital. February 15th.-Cawnpore: About a dozen vagrant lepers had been collected for the two Commissioners by Brigade- Surgeon J. H. Condon. February 17th and 18th.-The two Commissioners reach- ed Gwalior, where they were the guests of the Maharaja Scindia. Surgeon-Major A. M. Crofts assisted them in their enquiries. February 19th.-Agra was reached. February 23rd.-Aligarh was visited. Surgeon-Major W. H. Cadge kindly collected lepers for examination. February 25th.-The Commissioners proceeded to Delhi, where they were most hospitably entertained by Surgeon- Major B. Doyle, who assisted them in examining lepers in the city during their stay. March 2nd.-Peshawar: Surgeon H. Hendley had assem- bled a few lepers at the Civil Hospital.
Diary of the Commission. 7 March 5th.-The Asylum at Rawalpindi was visited. March 7th.-The Commissioners saw lepers at the Baba Lakhan Asylum (Sialkot), accompanied by Dr. Dhuni Mehta Chand, who gave them every assistance. March 8th.-They reached Jummoo, being during their stay the guests of the Maharaja of Kashmir. With Dr. Jag- gan Nath, the Civil Surgeon, cases were examined at the hospital. March 9th.-They arrived at Lahore and conducted their enquiries at the Civil Hospital with the assistance of Brigade- Surgeon W. Center. March 11th and 12th.-They visited Mooltan, and with Surgeon J. A. Cunningham collected information at the Civil Hospital. March 15th and 16th.-Accepting an invitation from the Maharaja, a stay of two days was made at Patiala, and by the courtesy of Brigade-Surgeon G. Thomson a number of lepers was examined. March 17th and 18th.-The Commissioners, through the kindness of the Maharaja, visited Kapurthalla, and with the aid of Surgeon-Major W. P. Warburton, the leper colony in this place was seen and interrogated. March 19th.-Accompanied by Surgeon G. W. P. Dennys, the Leper Asylum of Umballa was visited. March 22nd.- These two members reached Almora and here were met by the other Commissioner-S. J. T.-who had returned from Dehra Dun and commenced enquiries. From this date until April 16th, the Asylum was daily visited and notes were taken of the inmates both of the Asylum and the Orphanage. A large number of lepers was vaccinated and the lymph examined microscopically; specimens of blood, discharges from ulcers, and various excretions and secretions of the body were studied in order to ascertain the distribution of the leprosy bacillus. These and other investigations will be detailed in the
8 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: laboratory report. Dr. Carmichael and the Revd. G. H. Bul- loch gave every assistance. April 16th.-Leaving Almora B. N. R. and G. A. B. travelled back to the plains through Naini Tal, where a few lepers were seen at the dispensary. They here take the oppor- tunity of recording the great kindness shown them by Surgeon J. F. Tuohy. April 27th.-Simla was reached on April 27th, S. J. T. having preceded the other two Commissioners by a few days. Here the united Commission stayed until the completion of their enquiry, engaged chiefly in microscopical and bacteriolo- gical work.
?Local Notes:-Bengal. 9 CHAPTER II. Local Notes:-Bengal. BURDWAN. NO Asylum exists here. Twenty-three cases were col- lected and examined at the Civil Hospital and the Gaol. Among this number was one Brahmin. Eighteen lepers were married and had thirty-three children, or 18 to each marriage. Five cases had been vaccinated. Two cases that were seen, were not leprosy. Former censuses show that Burdwan is a district where leprosy is exceptionally prevalent, about twenty-five lepers to every ten thousand of the popula- tion. According to the census of 1881 the population of this district is 1,391,823, and the number of lepers is stated to be four thousand one hundred and eighteen or 295 to ten thousand of the population. The arrival of the Commission at any place frequently caused many lepers to leave the locality. The small number collected here is possibly to be explained in this way. CALCUTTA. The Leper Asylum was originally established in 1811. It was situated at Ballygunge, and the buildings accommodated forty persons. After thirteen years, during which time the governors of the Institution attempted by meetings, subscrip- tions, and applications to Government to enlarge the Institu- tion, but without definite results, the Asylum was moved from Ballygunge to Balliaghatta,and eighty persons could be received into the dwellings. Finally, in 1840, the present Asylum, which is situated in Amherst Street, and stands upon a site given by Government, was erected, the whole Institution being trans- ferred into the city in 1848, and the huts which had been
?10 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: moved from Balliaghatta were replaced by what are practically the present buildings. There are at present eighty-nine inmates, the majority of whom are Hindus. Sixty-four are married and have seventy- eight children, giving 12 to each marriage. Forty-seven cases had been vaccinated. Leper Inmates of the Asylum.    Europeans.  Eurasians. Native Christians.

Twelve of the cases seen were also suffering from syphilis, and three patients, among whom was one European, were suffering from diseases other than leprosy. DARJEELING. Seven cases were examined here, but among these three only were undoubted lepers. Two were married, with three children to each. One case had been vaccinated and one in- oculated.1 It does not appear that leprosy is very prevalent in Sikkim. The consumption of dried fish among the in- habitants as a flavouring is almost universal. Such fish is (1) Inoculation for small-pox is still practised to some extent as a protective measure in India, for, as is well known, the mortality from the inoculated disease is much less than from the infective disease, and the form of the disease is milder in the former, than in the latter, case. Material from a small-pox pustule is taken mixed with water and introduced under the skin with a lancet. The site for in- oculation is the flexor surface of the forearm (Punjab) or the wrist. This practice is of great antiquity in the East. It was introduced into England from Turkey by Lady Mary Wortley Montague in 1763. During the first quarter of this cen- tury it was practised in preference to vaccination. Inoculation for small-pox in England was made illegal by Act of Parliament in 1840.
?Local Notes:-Bengal. 11 imported to these hills from Calcutta, and in the bazaar of Darjeeling it is a common article for sale. GYA. This is the chief town in the district of Behar. It is a city of pilgrimages, and both here and at Buddh Gya, eight miles distant numbers of lepers were seen in the streets. Number of lepers per ten thousand of population was 9.8 for 1872 and 9.5 for 1881. Forty-four cases were examined here, and of this number two were free from leprosy. There is no Asylum, but the Civil Surgeon arranged with the local authorities that lepers should be collected in the compound of the Civil Hospital. A very large proportion of those who were examined were Beharis, and came from the district. Thirty-three were Hindus, among these two Brahmins. Nine were Muhammadans, or 21.4 per cent. Forty-one were married. Total number of children born to these was seventy-eight, giving. 1.9 to each marriage. Twenty-six had been inoculated for small-pox. None had been vaccinated. Thirteen had suffered from small-pox. Of twenty-eight cases where enquiries were made, ten had suffered from syphilis. Diet.-Both Brahmins denied eating fish or meat; butter, milk, dl, and rice being the chief food. In nineteen cases enquiries about diet were made, and it was ascertained that- Five had never eaten fish. Seven had sparingly eaten fish. Seven had frequently eaten fish. Two cases produced were not leprosy. Enquiries made at Gya showed that the following customs
12 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: were followed among the people of this district. Children eat out of the same dish with their father, but the wife never does she only eats after the dish has been washed. Hindu women do not eat flesh or fish after the death of their husbands. Many Hindus never eat fish or flesh from childhood. In lower castes, if the husband leaves any food, the wife will eat it. In higher castes, if the husband leaves food, no person will eat it, but it will be given to the children, or, in the absence of children, to poorer people. PURULIA. There is both an Asylum and an Orphanage here. The Revd. H. Uffmann, of the German Evangelical Lutheran Mis- sion, opened the former in February 1888, and the latter in the summer of the same year. There are ninety-nine leper inmates, sixty-one males and thirty-eight females. The sexes are separated. Up to the present time no child has been born in the Asylum. The lepers are attended by a resident native doctor. Twenty-three children are maintained in a separate com- pound, which is adjacent to the Asylum. They are all healthy. Three patients who had suspicious symptoms at the time of admission, subsequently became lepers, and were removed to the Asylum. No child, which was originally healthy, has yet become a leper. Madras. CALICUT. The Asylum at Calicut consists of one large well-built bungalow, on the seashore. It has been in existence for more
Local Notes:-Madras. 13 than thirty years. The Civil Surgeon attends to the inmates. Patients do not receive fish, simply because the diet table of the Asylum was a copy of one used in the Municipal Hospital, where fish is excluded. A peculiar macular discoloration of the skin is common in the Malabar district. These patches were exceedingly like leprosy, but there was no ansthesia. Indeed this skin disease has nothing to do with leprosy. Ten or twelve cases seen at the prison simply showed this skin discoloration. Elephantiasis is very common in Calicut. Twenty-seven patients, lepers, were examined here, and among these one case was not leprosy. Of these, twenty-one were married and had forty-eight children, or 2.2 to each marriage. Seven lepers had been vaccinated. One of the servants at the Asylum had contracted leprosy. Fish is a common article of diet in Calicut. CONJEEVERAM. The population of Conjeeveram is 37,275, and it is believed that there are about a hundred lepers here. There is no Asy- lum. Eighteen lepers, all of whom were Hindus, were ex- amined. Among these were many silk weavers. Of this num- ber, thirteen were married. The number of children was forty- two, or 3.2 to each marriage. As Conjeeveram is one of the seven sacred Hindu cities, a great number of Brahmins live here, some of whom suffer from leprosy. According to enquiries which were made here no fish is eaten by Brahmins, whether they be rich or poor; indeed this rule is rigidly followed. Only in rare cases, where from contact with Europeans a certain degree of education has arisen, is this rule broken. MADRAS. The Asylum of Madras consists of a number of bungalows built in a compound situated in Black Town. The garden is
14 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION : planted with trees and flowers, and the comfort of the inmates is considered in every way. The sanitation of the Asylum and ventilation of the wards is thoroughly well arranged. The diet is liberal, and the marked effect of this on the health of the patients is at once evident. The most varied attempts at palliative treatment, some of which have met with distinct success in the hands of the Civil Surgeon, have been carried out in this Asylum. The sexes are separated. There are numerous Eurasian inmates. A separate ward also is occupied by convict lepers. At the present time the inmates number one hundred and eighty-four. Twenty-five are Eurasians, and the majority of the remainder are Hindus. Eighty-seven are married. The number of children born to these marriages was two hundred and fifty-one, giving 2.8 to each marriage. Elephantiasis, which is exceedingly common in Madras, was not seen among those lepers who were examined. MADURA. There is no Asylum at Madura. One hundred and twenty- three patients were collected by the municipal authorities in the compound of the Civil Hospital. Among this number ten were not lepers. Seventy-four lepers were married, with a total number of one hundred and ninety-three children, giving 2.6 for each marriage. Thirty-six lepers had been vaccinated. Mycetoma (Madura foot) was not seen among the lepers who were examined. TANJORE. There is no Asylum in this city. Among twenty patients examined at the Civil Hospital sixteen were lepers, and one of these was an Eurasian. Ten were married, with a total of fifteen children, or 15 to each marriage. Six patients had been vaccinated.
Local Notes:-Bombay. 15 TRICHINOPOLY. The Municipal Leper Hospital can accommodate sixteen patients. Nineteen patients were seen here, and all were in an advanced stage of the disease. Three of those examined were not lepers. Less severe cases, estimated at about one hundred and sixty, are vagrants in the city and immediate neighbour- hood. Of the cases examined nine were Hindus. Eight lepers were married, with a total of eight children, or 10 to each marriage. Bombay. BELGAUM. There are two Asylums in Belgaum: one founded in 1863 for male, the other erected in 1872 for female, lepers. These are distant about half a mile from each other, not in secluded parts of the city but surrounded with dwellings. The buildings each consist of a long hut built of laterite with a verandah; partitions divide this into about a dozen compartments. Behind the female asylum is a street, about 12 feet wide, with houses full of people on the opposite side. The inhabitants do not seem to fear the disease spreading, for during the past seven years no case of leprosy has occurred in proximity to the asylum. Father Gonsalvo, a Portuguese priest, charitably looks after the lepers. There is no compulsory detention, but begging is prohibited. The attendant of the female asylum during the last eleven years has lived next door to the build ing, and is perfectly healthy. BOMBAY. Three colonies of lepers were examined in Bombay and the immediate neighbourhood, at Trombay, in the Dharmsala,
16 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: and in the recently erected Asylum at Matoonga. Numbers of lepers were also seen in the streets of the city. During the present year the inmates of the Trombay Asylum have been transferred to Matoonga. Vagrant lepers, and many from the Dharmsala, are now also in the same Institution. The Asylum at Trombay lies to the north of the city and is distant about six miles. It is quite isolated and stands upon rising ground. The site was given by a Parsi, who in 1885 erected a large well-built bungalow for the use of lepers of all castes and creeds. It is a semi-religious charity, the inmates, twenty-four in number, being all Native Christians. In the middle of the bazaar, closely surrounded by houses, is the Dharmsala founded by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy. This is entered from Duncan Street. A colony of about one hun- dred and seventy lepers-men, women, and children, healthy and diseased-inhabit the place, which consists of several alleys along which water trickles in a central gutter, with badly built mud huts on both sides. The lepers are free to come or go, and by the provision of the founder each man and woman receives daily one seer of rice and three pie (about 1/5 d.), and each child half a seer of rice and two pie. The Superintendent of the Dharmsala has been resident there for twelve years and continued free from leprosy. His predecessor lived in the same quarters for thirty years and did not develop the disease. The indigent quarter of the Dharmsala is close to the leper colony, yet no instance could be discovered showing that the disease spread to the former. The recently erected Asylum at Matoonga lies about six miles north of Bombay fort. The Institution was founded by subscriptions and municipal funds. On a site of several acres, enclosed with wire fencing, a number of blocks of buildings are raised. Each block is built upon slightly rising ground. The walls consist of a single course of bricks; the roof is con- structed of palm leaves. The interior of each block is com-
Local Notes:- Bombay. 17 pletely divided lengthways by a sheet of corrugated iron, eight feet high, so as to form two wards in each block. The floors are concrete and the walls whitewashed. Each ward contains about twenty beds. The whole is well ventilated. The sexes are separated. The sanitary arrangements are very good. The solid excreta are collected, removed, and subsequently thrown into the sea. The liquid matters run into gullies and thence into a main pipe which terminates in a percolating cesspool, made of morrhum and ballast. A shaft, filled with chloride of lime, intercepts the drain, so that this disinfectant is slowly washed away into the interior of the pit. POONA. The David Sassoon Infirm Asylum is on the outskirts of the native city. It was founded in 1865 and contains seventy- seven inmates, among these thirty-five lepers (males twenty- three, females nine, children three). The lepers come from the neighbouring districts and are admitted at their own request. After admission they are not permitted to go out and beg, and if an inmate leaves without permission he is not re-admitted. The lepers live in detached bungalows, the sexes being sepa- rated. Separate buildings and latrines are arranged for the leprous and non-leprous inmates. Both the Superintendent of the Asylum, who has lived there for sixteen years, and the medical assistant, whose service has been seven years, are quite free from disease. No birth among the leper colony has occurred for many years. With the exception of the latrines the hygienic arrangements are good. Forty-five cases were examined here, and among these there was only one Muhammadan. A single Brahmin was an inmate. Thirty-six patients were married, and the total number of children was forty-seven, giving 1.3 for each marri- age. Seventeen lepers had been vaccinated. c
18 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: YERROWDA PRISON (POONA). The Yerrowda Prison lies about four miles north of Poona. The leper criminals of the Presidency are collected here, and lodged in a separate building and do not mix with the healthy prisoners. One Brahmin was seen here and one Rajput be- longing to the Bansi caste. According to the statement of this patient, members of this caste never, under any circum- stances, eat fish, even in times of great scarcity. If fish were even at such times able to be procured, this would not be eaten. One prisoner has developed leprosy since admission to the Goal. To the ten married lepers twenty children had been born, or 2.0 children to each marriage. Punjab. DELHI. There is no Asylum here. but twelve persons were collected for examination by the Civil Surgeon. Of these eleven were lepers, of whom six were Hindus, all of low castes (Chamar and weaver), and five Muhammadans. Nine were married and had thirty-three children in all, or 3.6 to each marriage. Ten were unvaccinated or inoculated. Where enquiries were made as to fish, all admitted they were frequent fish-eaters. It appears to be a common belief here that if fish is eaten and then milk drunk directly afterwards, that probably leprosy will be produced. It does not matter if fish be eaten on one day and milk on the next. It was also mentioned that at Garh- muktesar, twenty-five miles from Meerut, on the banks of the Ganges, there were a great number of lepers. One case of syphilis was produced as leprosy.
Local Notes:-Punjab. 19 DHARMSALA. A small colony of lepers inhabit two well-built huts, sur- rounded with gardens, situated on a hill some distance from the cantonment. Five men occupy one hut, and seven females the other; a compounder and his family occupy a third building on the same hill. He has been there thirteen years, and both himself and family are perfectly healthy. LAHORE. There is no Asylum at Lahore, neither is the district afflicted with leprosy to any marked extent. Two cases only were seen at the Civil Hospital, and both of these were vagrants who had come from Kashmir. The prevalence of leprosy in the division and district of Lahore, according to the census of 1868 and that of 1881, is shown in the following table:-          Population. Total number of Lepers.

The cost per annum of maintaining each leper is about R50. Food consists chiefly of spiked millets during the winter months and wheat mixed with barley in the summer; meat, ghee, and vegetables according to their means.2 The Asylum contained forty-seven lepers and one patient free from the disease. Of this number forty-six were Muham- madans. A considerable number of lepers came from the Native State of Punch on the eastern boundary of Kashmir. Thirty- two cases were married with fifty-two children, giving 1.6 to each marriage. Five cases had been vaccinated. Thirty-two cases had been inoculated. SUBATHU. This hill station lies about twenty-three miles south-west of Simla. There is a Leper Asylum here, supported by the American Mission to Lepers in India and by public contribu- tions. It is under the superintendence of a resident missionary and a medical assistant. There is accommodation for eighty- five inmates. They occupy several buildings which are ex- ceedingly comfortable. The patients are allowed to go out- side the Asylum on certain days of the week. In addition to lepers other patients are received from charity. Medicine and advice are also given to lepers and patients suffering from other diseases. Forty-six lepers were examined here. Five patients stated that they had never eaten fish or meat. Forty-three were married and had forty-eight children. SIALKOT. The Leper Asylum at Baba Lakhan was founded in 1866. It is situated nine miles south of Sialkot. The buildings consist (2) "Rawalpindi Gazetteer."
22               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: of three double barracks accommodating seventy-two lepers, a cookhouse, barrack for servants, two wells, and a garden. Medical attendance is given by the Assistant Surgeon of Sialkot. A few out-patients are also treated here. The average number of inmates from 1878 to 1891 was sixty-five. The cost per annum per inmate was about R40. The food of the people is chiefly grain and vegetables. Meat is a luxury few can afford. Fish is seldom eaten even by those residing near rivers.3 The Asylum has at present forty inmates, of whom thirty- two are Muhammadans and eight Hindus. Thirty-seven are married with fifty-seven children in all, giving 1.5 to each marriage. Ten cases had been vaccinated and two inoculated, while twenty-three had suffered from small-pox. TARN TARAN (AMRITSAR). The Leper Asylum at Tarn Taran is situated about one mile west of the town of that name. It was built in 1858. The buildings are two double rows of huts in lines of thirty-five each, and they will accommodate one hundred and forty inmates. Owing to the reputation that the water of a tank close to the temple founded by Arjan, the fifth Guru of the Sikhs, has for healing powers in leprosy, large numbers of lepers, who bathe in and drink the water, congregate in the town. The Asylum is under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon of  Amritsar, an Assistant Surgeon being in charge of the Institution. The Leper Asylum is maintained by the municipal funds of Amritsar, the expenses of lepers from other districts being recovered from the places to which they belong. There are at present one hundred and forty-six inmates, one hundred and six of these being married.  The total number of children is one hundred and eighty-five.

In 1889 the inmates numbered one hundred and eighteen, of whom seventy-five were males and forty-three females. Fifty of these were Muhammadans. An analysis of the total number4 showed that of one hundred and fourteen lepers- Thirty-one admitted that fish was never eaten. Five admitted that fish was seldom eaten. Forty-two admitted that fish was often eaten. Thirty-six admitted that a mixed diet was eaten. Many wealthy lepers live in a separate quarter of the town of Tarn Taran. It was not possible to obtain any information from them. UMBALLA. The Asylum was founded in 1856. It is situated north- east of the city. The average number of in-patients is thirty- two, though there is accommodation for forty. There are no out-patients. It is under the superintendence of the American Missionary. Medicines are supplied gratis by the City Chari- table Dispensary, and the Civil Surgeon visits the Asylum from time to time. The yearly expenditure is about R 1,700. Voluntary subscriptions for the most part defray the expenses. Clothing, food, medicines, and accommodation are given by this Asylum. The staple food of the people is wheat and gram; dl is also largely consumed. Thirty-two lepers were examined. Twenty-nine lepers were Hindus. With the exception of one Brahmin, most of these belonged to the Chamar, Dhobi, and other low castes. Three were Muhammadans and Rajputs. (4) Communication on   January 8th, 1890, to Epid.

One such case examined was hereditary syphilis. Feudatory States. KAPURTHALLA. A small colony of ten lepers exists here, who live on the outskirts of the native city. All were Muhammadans. Of this number six were married, with a total of twelve children. Four cases had been vaccinated. PATIALA. Nine lepers were seen here, and several other patients collected with these were suffering from syphilis and other diseases. Six were Hindus, and among these two Brahmins; three were Muhammadans. To seven married lepers there were born seven children.    No case had been vaccinated.

A set of buildings arranged as two quad- rangles, the larger one for men and the smaller for women, so that the sexes are separated, are occupied by fifty-four lepers. Among twenty Hindus there were three Brahmins. Thirty-eight lepers were married. The number of children was sixty-seven.    Seven cases had been vaccinated. ALIGARH. Cases were examined at the Civil Hospital. Among ten cases seven were Hindus and three Muhammadans; included in the former was one Brahmin. Among eight marriages there were in all thirty-five children, or 4.3 to each marriage. ALMORA The establishment of the Almora Leper Asylum is the work of Sir Henry Ramsay, who, in 1840, was appointed Resident Civil Officer in Kumaun. At his own expense he raised a building on the eastern slope of Almora which could accom- modate about thirty inmates, and with the help of friends sustained the expense of the maintenance of these. In 1850 the Institution was handed over to the London Missionary Society, and subsequently the site changed to the present one on an isolated hill, south-east of the station. There are now seven barracks which will accommodate one hundred and thirty inmates, a bungalow for the resident care-taker, a dis- pensary, a store-room, a school and a church, together with out-houses for servants and attendants. All the buildings are of stone with slate roofs.    Each barrack is divided into com-
26                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: partments, one of which will accommodate three inmates. A wall surrounds the compound which is well planted with cherry, plum, and other fruit trees within this area. Crops of potatoes, vegetables, and grain of all sorts are cultivated by the inmates, who themselves use the produce. The trench- ing system is adopted as a sanitary measure. The number of inmates is generally greater in summer than in winter, for residence is quite voluntary. The sexes are strictly separated, and children born here removed into an Orphanage in Almora. The income of the Institution is derived from a yearly grant made by the Mission to lepers in India of R2,400, and one of R120 from the Almora Municipality, aided by a few private subscriptions. There is also an endowment which yields yearly R2,145, During the year 1890 the expenditure was as follows:-  R    a. Diet, clothing, firewood 4,740 12 Repairs, medicine, funeral expenses 662    4 Establishment, including care-taker 647    0  6,050  0 By the rules of the Institution attendance at the church and school is voluntary, and all are treated alike without refer- ence to race or creed. Bathing once a week in the bath- rooms provided for the purpose is compulsory, and the cloth- ing must be washed at the same time. Any inmate dis- regarding the rules is either excluded for a time from the rest of the community, or expelled from the Institution, accord- ing  to the gravity of the offence.5 Leprosy is prevalent in the district of Kumaun. The figures available show that about twenty per ten thousand of the population are lepers, the ratio for the whole of India being five to ten thousand.   Possibly this fact may be explained (5) This information was kindly supplied by the Revd. G. M. Bulloch.

A certain number of these come from Nepal and Garhwal. Very few are from the plains. Sixty-one lepers were married. Number of children one hundred and seventeen, that is, 1.9 to each marriage. Forty-two cases had been vaccinated, and forty-one inoculated. BENARES. Thirty-six lepers were examined here at the Secrole Dis- pensary. Four patients who had been collected were not lepers. Details as to religion, in twenty-eight cases, showed that twenty-six were Hindus and two Muhammadans, and among the former six Brahmins, all of whom state that they had never eaten fish. When enquiring about the Koeri caste (cultivators and gardeners), it appeared that there are two sub-divisions of this, the Sakatiha who eat fish and meat, and the Bhagatiha who never eat fish and meat. Twenty-seven lepers were married; the total   number of children was sixty-four, giving 2.3 children for each marriage. The number vaccinated was four. CAWNPORE. In the opinion of the Civil Surgeon there were very few lepers in Cawnpore. Those that were seen appeared to be confirmed beggars. Ten lepers were examined here. Nine were Hindus, among these three Brahmins. One was a Muhammadan. All were married. Total number of children born fifteen, ten before and five after the disease appeared in the  parent,  or   1.5   to   each   marriage.

There were eight ansthetic cases and two examples of the mixed form of the disease. No evidence of hereditary or collateral taints was elicited by examination. DEHRA DUN. The Asylum which Surgeon-Major G. G. Maclaren com- menced to build in 1877, stands upon a site, about four acres in area, which lies south of the town of Dehra. The money for this was raised by voluntary subscriptions and donations put aside for the purpose since 1872. After the erection in 1878, Government gave an annual grant-in-aid of R 1,500, and the total income of the Institution in 1890 was R5,280. The number of inmates that year was one hundred and one, so that there is a yearly cost per inmate of about R52. The whole compound is enclosed. About two-thirds of this space is occupied by a garden in which fruit trees (mango, guava, jack, plantain) and tea bushes are cultivated for the use of the inmates. The remaining space is divided into two by a high wall, on either side of which a long building, divided into compartments, each capable of accommodating eight to ten people, is constructed. The sloping roofs of these two buildings project forward about six feet, and form a ver- andah. The men's quarters are on one side, the women's on the other of this wall, so that there is complete separation of the sexes. The dry-earth and trench systems are adopted as sanitary measures. By the rules of the Asylum admission is voluntary, but when a leper has availed himself of this benefit, his permanent residence here is insisted upon. There is no objection, should a leper from a distant district wish for admission. As a matter of fact a large number come from Garhwal. It is rare for a Muhammadan to become an inmate.

In Fyzabad, together with Ajodhya, five miles distant, eighteen lepers were examined. Among this number was one Brahmin. Thirteen were married; number of children twenty, or 1.5 to each marriage. One case that was seen was not leprosy. LUCKNOW. There is no Asylum at Lucknow, but fourteen lepers occupy the poor-house, and are under the charge of the Civil Sur- geon. Of these six were Muhammadans. Eleven were married. Number of children thirteen. Among the lepers there were two intermarriages, but no children had been born. One patient who had been admitted as a leper was suffering from epilepsy. NAINI AND ALLAHABAD. Sixty-six lepers collected from the prisons of the district were seen in the Gaol at Naini. One Brahmin and one Burman were among this number. Fifty-three patients were married, and the total number of children was seventy-four, giving 1.3 to each marriage. Twelve lepers had been vaccinated. NAINI TAL. Leprosy is not very prevalent here. Only two cases were examined, both were Hindus. One was married and had a single child.    One case had been vaccinated.
30               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Central Provinces. JUBBULPORE. Thirty-eight cases were examined in the compound of the hospital. Only fifteen were lepers, a large proportion of the other cases (twenty-two out of twenty-three) being patients who had leukoderma, which is especially prevalent in this district, and is frequently regarded as leprosy. Eleven lepers were married. Number of children twenty-six, or 2.3 to each marriage. Only two cases had been vaccinated. It was im- possible to ascertain to what extent leprosy prevails in Jubbul- pore, as a large proportion of the population was absent at a religious fair. NAGPUR. One hundred and eighty-eight cases were seen here at the Civil Hospital. It appeared from enquiries that leprosy is very prevalent in the district.   Of the cases examined one hundred and seventy-four were lepers; of these one hundred and thirty-seven were married. The total number of children was two hundred and ninety-five, or 2.1 to each marriage. Thirty-seven cases had been vaccinated. In Nagpur Muhammadans appear to suffer more from leprosy than do Hindus. About thirty or forty Brahmins are lepers. In this district fish is a great luxury, and the rivers which are in the neighbourhood are small streams for the greater part of the year and yield but little fish at any time. Some lepers were seen selling articles in the bazaar. Central India Agency. GWALIOR. There is no Asylum in this State, but a census made in the autumn of  1890 showed the leper population of Gwalior, and

The total number of children born was eleven, eight before and three after the appearance of the disease: this gives 1.2 to each marriage. No leper had been vaccinated or inoculated. Enquiries about fish were made in seven cases, and three patients denied that they had ever eaten fish or meat. Burma. MANDALAY. In Burma lepers and others afflicted with loathsome di- seases are regarded more with pity than aversion, but never- theless they are outcasts, and must live in villages by them- selves or else associate with beggars and pagoda servants. They usually frequent the pagoda steps, and on feast days they receive abundant alms, a handful of rice or a copper coin being dropped by the worshippers into a basket or platter placed in front of each leper. One hundred and eighty lepers were examined at Mandalay; one hundred and thirty-three of these were Burmans.    There were also thirty-five Muhamma-

The number of children born was one hundred and sixty-two, or 2.0 to each marriage. Eleven lepers had been vaccinated and four inoculated. Three cases examined were not leprosy. MOULMEIN. Among twenty-six cases seen here twenty-five were lepers, and of these eleven were Hindus and eleven Burmans. Sixteen were married, and the number of children born was twenty-four, or 1.5 to each marriage. Seven lepers had been vaccinated. PROME. A house-to-house enquiry was instituted at Prome, and thirty lepers were examined here. With the exception of two Chinamen, all the cases were Burmans. Twenty were married, and the total number of children was thirty. Four patients had been vaccinated and two inoculated. Two other patients who were not lepers were also seen. RANGOON. There is no Leper Asylum in the whole of Burma. Lepers for the most part are vagrant beggars, and a number of them may generally be found grouped around the entrances of the pagodas. Sixty-six cases were examined in Rangoon, collect- ed from the Shway Dagohn Temple and in the town. A certain number were seen in the Central Gaol. Forty-eight of the above number were Burmans, and four were not lepers. Forty-one were married. The total number of children to these marriages was seventy-one, giving 1.7 to each marriage. Eleven cases had been vaccinated and twelve inoculated.

Sixty-five cases, which were chiefly Burmans, were ex- amined in Thayetmyo. One patient was an Eurasian. Thirty lepers were married. Number of children fifty-five, that is, about two to each marriage. Twelve lepers had been vacci- nated . and eight inoculated. Three cases on enquiry were found to be free from leprosy. Native States. HYDERABAD. Among thirty patients collected for investigation at Hyder- abad twenty-one were lepers. Notes of thirteen of these were taken at the house of a charitable native gentleman, and eight additional cases were seen among the native troops and also in the Central Gaol. Six or seven lepers were also to be found begging in the Mecca Musjid. Among twenty-one cases twelve were Muhammadans and nine Hindus. Thirteen were married, and the number of children born to these was twenty-four. It was noticed that a large number of lepers also suffered from syphilis. The number of lepers in and around the city was small according to the census of 1881. For the city it amounted to one per ten thousand of the population, the ratio being twice as (7) In Burma a putrescent preparation of fish is largely eaten, called nga-pi. It is prepared as follows: " A quantity of semi-putrid fish is put into a jar some salt, and suffered to rot until it is crowded with maggots. It is then baked, worms and all, over the fire, and potted for after use. The Burmans can no more live withou nga-pi than others without fish." (Fenwick) Art. Fish, 296. Dict. of Econ.

At the commence- ment of 1890, there were twenty-five inmates, fourteen males and eleven females. By November of the same year, eleven additional cases, six men and five women, had been admitted. Twenty-three cases were examined in the Asylum and forty in a compound adjoining the Civil Hospital. Forty-three lepers were married. The total number of children born to these was seventy-two, or 1.6 to each marriage. Thirteen cases had been vaccinated. The records of the Asylum show that in no single instance has any inmate of the Lunatic Asylum ever contracted leprosy. Elephantiasis was associated with leprosy in one case that was examined. An extensive trial of various modes of treatment

This city and the surrounding area appeared almost free from leprosy. Only two cases were examined here; both were Hindus, married, with three children free from disease. One of the lepers had been vaccinated. With reference to leprosy in Kashmir it has been noticed that the neighbouring Native State of Punch supplied many inmates for the Asylum at Rawalpindi. Quite recently a Leper Asylum has been established at Srinagar. A leper census, show- ing the prevalence of the disease in the valley of Kashmir for 1890, is given in the following table:-      Men.

36 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: CHAPTER III. Geographical Distribution of Leprosy in India and its Relation to Climate, Soil, and Race. IN an enquiry into the leper population of India many diffi- culties present themselves. The only source of informa- tion is found in the Imperial Census Reports. The census was instituted some twenty years ago, so that at present three sets of figures regarding the population are available. The lepers were enumerated on all three occasions. But since the diag- nosis as to what constitutes a leper is as a rule left to unpro- fessional enumerators, the figures cannot possess an absolute value. There can be no doubt that in the censuses, especially in the first two, many cases of leukoderma have been included under the heading of leprosy and, on the other hand, many cases of leprosy must have been omitted in all three enumera- tions.1 It is more than probable, that especially in the case of women, the returns are very faulty and imperfect. No doubt men suffer more than women, but it would be erroneous to argue exclusively from census returns, for the "purda" cuts off all possibility of verification. Though these decennial figures cannot be said to have an absolute value, are they altogether worthless ? By no means, for they possess a high relative value, which is greatly enhanced as census follows census. It may be assumed that the errors for each particular occasion are more or less evenly distributed over the country, so that one census by itself fully justifies comparative considerations. When, however, means exists to check one set of figures with an other, the value of such (1) To obtain an estimate of the amount of errors that do occur, reference should be made to the appendix to this chapter "Census, 1871, Bombay." Here for a few districts two sets of figures are given, one for true and false leprosy without distinction, and another for the true disease only. The differences are remarkable.
Distribution of Leprosy. 37 considerations is greatly increased. When, for instance, it is found that the specific leper population for Sind was very small in 1872 and likewise in 1881 and 1891, and when the different conditions under which the census was taken on the three occasions are taken cognizance of, it must be regarded as established that here leprosy is not prevalent. Again, when a district or division periodically returns a high percentage of lepers, no reasonable doubt can exist as to the frequency of the disease over such area. Could enumerations take place at oft-repeated intervals, the figures would well nigh be of abso- lute value. On the other hand, how does the case stand, when such questions as the increase or decrease of leprosy from year to year or from decade to decade, are raised ? Here the difficul- ties are still greater and under the existing conditions the greatest care must be exercised. For from three sets of figures arguments can only be deduced with caution, especially if these figures have merely a more or less relative value. Therefore all that will be said regarding this point must be taken rather as suggestions which gain in value as the figures approach the standard of correctness. The Commissioners have felt all along the insecurity of the ground invaded, and this chapter shall point out how various are the factors which possibly may have an influence over the leper population, and that before the alarming statements of the rapid increase of leprosy over India are accepted, the most critical and scrupulous tests must be applied. Leprosy has been called an " Imperial Danger," which as such deserves the fullest attention of the Government of India. Imperial, no doubt, leprosy is, for no part of India is free from it, but a danger it can only be, if it be shown to increase at such a rate as to undermine the health and life of the general population. Those who speak of the great spread of the disease can evidently have no other support for their arguments than that afforded by census returns, and they must stand or fall by them: for them the value of these figures is absolute. This matter, therefore, as to how far leprosy is
38 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: an "Imperial Danger," and as such of the greatest importance to the empire, will be fully considered. When in the following pages allusion is often made to the uncertainty of the figures, this will bear testimony to the great doubt with which the Commissioners approached many questions and the hesitation with which they venture to sug- gest certain lines of arguments or personal opinions regarding a country of which they know but little and which to Western Europe at present is almost a terra incognita, so far as those points are concerned which may be said to be of tiological importance in the causation of disease. Comparisons between Indian and European life are only too readily made, and in the study of a disease the Western standard applied to all condi- tions alike. The ignorance and want of education of the popu- lation, often called the "Indian People," not to speak of the vastness of the empire, are altogether lost sight of. Then again there is the Oriental indifference which is encountered everywhere and the eagerness of the Indians to agree with any suggestion made by the enquirer. "Especial care will always be requisite in collecting statistics of this kind to guard against the incurable proneness of ordinary natives to report as the result of any investigation whatever in their opinion their immediate superior wishes the result to be."2 Those who most fully appreciate these differences between Western and Eastern conditions will best understand the great diffidence with which the Commissioners have ventured to express their personal opinions on many questions discussed in this chapter. Geographical Distribution of Leprosy. I.-The following remarks apply in the first instance to British India, as less accurate data are obtainable regarding the Native and Feudatory States, and as these are of less interest in a strictly imperial question, being outside the pale (2) Report on the Census of Oudh, Vol. I, page 151.
Distribution of Leprosy. 39 of the Government. Three maps are appended showing not only the distribution but also the prevalence of the disease over the country. The maps have been compiled after the leprosy-map of Drs. Lewis and Cunningham,3 and all three may be regarded as fairly accurate representations of the relative amount of leprosy existing in the different parts of India. The Commissioners consider it their pleasant duty here to acknowledge the assistance they have obtained from Colonel Waterhouse, Assistant Surveyor-General of India. A glance at the maps shows that leprosy is found in all parts of British India, and it is known that it also occurs in all Native States. The latter were enumerated in the recent census under the supervision of the Imperial Census Commis- sioner, and have been in part included in Map III. The prevalence of the disease, however, varies in the different presidencies and provinces. To clearly demonstrate this point various tints have been employed: red representing the lowest ratios, and brown, yellow, green, blue, and black the amount of leprosy according to the census figures or the various districts in an ascending order. It will also be seen that the relative prevalence varies within certain limits for each of the three decennial periods. Thus, in 1872, "leprosy prevailed to an extraordinary extent in Beerbhoom and Bankoora in the Burdwan Division of Lower Bengal, in the Kumaun Division of the North-Western Provinces, extending across the southern range of the Hima- layas; and in the Deccan and Konkan Divisions of the Bombay Presidency. The latter area, considered as a whole, does not show such an extreme prevalence as the two others: leprosy is, however, extremely prevalent, and in some districts, such as Barsi, Sowda, and Rajapur, abounds to a degree as great as is manifested in Beerbhoom, Bankoora, and Kumaun."4 " Of the three presidencies, Madras, though not containing (3) Leprosy in India.

40 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: the fewest lepers, taking the absolute numbers, presents the lowest ratio, viz., forty-four to a hundred thousand, whereas Bombay presents a proportion of leprous population nearly double that of Madras, eighty-five lepers to every one hundred thousand, although the absolute number of lepers in the Bom- bay Presidency is slightly fewer.5 The presidency of Bengal furnishes an intermediate proportion; very considerably lower, however, when the whole presidency is considered than that of Bombay. One of the divisions in Bengal-Burdwan-contains a greater proportion of lepers, and absolute numbers almost as great as those of the whole of the Bombay or Madras Presidency."6 According to the census of 1881, of the three presidencies Madras again presents the lowest ratio, viz., forty-seven to a hundred thousand, while Bombay, though containing the fewest lepers in absolute numbers, holds an intermediate position, show- ing a proportion of sixty-one to a hundred thousand; Bengal just exceeding this. As in 1871, the disease is found to be most prevalent in Bankoora and Beerbhoom; next in the Simla District, Dehra Dun, in Kumaun (especially in the Almora Dis- trict): the number of lepers in every one hundred thousand varying from one hundred and sixty-one to three hundred and seventy-two. There is very little change with regard to the Deccan and Konkan Divisions of the Bombay Presidency as compared with 1871, but according to Mr. Baines's Census Report for 1881 "leprosy is probably returned in greater number than it should be, owing to the inclusion of cases of the false or discolorative disease." Finally, the present census of 1891 shows a general decrease of leprosy all over India. The leprosy-map is also more com- plete, as Hyderabad, Rajputana, Upper Burma, and other areas have been included in the general enumeration. Unfortunately the Central Provinces, the greater portion of the Central India Agency and the Feudatory States had to be omitted, as at the (5) In the Bombay Presidency, however, no distinction was drawn between "white" and "black or true" leprosy, so that the figures for the area are too high.

Distribution of Leprosy.                              41 time of writing the necessary returns were unobtainable. All the statistical figures relating to these tracts had to be dispensed with. This fact will not affect the arguments as to the possible increase or decrease of leprosy in the slightest, but the Com- missioners greatly regret that through waiting several months for such returns much valuable time has been lost and the ap- pearance of this Report unnecessarily delayed. In the British territory the highest ratios once more are found in Bankoora and Beerbhoom, the number of lepers in every one hundred thousand amounting to about three hundred and fifty. Burdwan, Simla, Dehra Dun, and Kumaun again show a comparatively great prevalence of the disease. Altogether the remarks on the previous censuses apply to the present one-a distinct confirmation of the relative accuracy of the figures and ratios-and it is therefore not necessary to discuss the matter further, especially as the maps will give a better and more complete idea of the changes that have taken place in the leper population than any description or comments in words. Two tables will now be given to show the number and pro- portion of lepers in the three presidencies, and the most affected districts according: to the three censuses. TABLE  I.

By also noting the proportions for
?Distribution of Leprosy. 45 the other two censuses facilities are given to study any changes in the relative leper proportion that may have occurred. It will be found that, generally speaking, the ratios for the present census are lowest, thus indicating a relative, if not an absolute, decrease of leprosy, as far as it is possible to argue from such figures. "The foregoing numerical data regarding the distribution of leprosy in British India can, as already stated, be accepted as only approximately correct, so far as the actual enumer- ation of the lepers is concerned, but what is probably of considerably more importance in connexion with the study of its tiology is, that they convey fairly accurate information regarding the particular parts of the country where the disease is most prevalent."7 II.-It has been maintained that leprosy is most prevalent on the sea coast or the borders of large rivers.8 With regard to India, Mr. Hutchinson asserts9 that the chief prevalence of the disease is on the seaboard or in the valleys. Leprosy, as was mentioned above, is found all over India, and it remains to examine whether it is more common along the sea coast and large rivers. Looking at the map for 1872 it becomes evident that the districts where the disease is most prevalent are as a rule inland. Taking the evidence afforded by the two previous censuses first, amongst the facts conveyed by the maps this is brought out most strikingly, that all along the Gangetic Valley, fifty to one hundred miles north and south of the Ganges, the ratio of lepers is lowest, with the exception of the Burdwan Division. At the delta itself the proportion may be said to be about five to ten thousand. The same applies to the area included between (7) Lewis and Cunningham. Op. cit., page 8.

46 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: the five rivers of the Punjab. In fact, for the first and second censuses the smallest proportions of lepers were found in the four "doabs" between the Indus, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej-and thence down the whole course of the Indus and along the coast from Kurrachee to Ahmedabad. So it is, generally speaking, with the other rivers. Thus along the banks of the Nerbadda the ratio was extremely low for 1871-72 and not excessive for 1881, while for the Koleroon river it was under five per ten thousand for both censuses, with the exception of Tanjore. Along the south banks of the Kistna and Tungabadra the distribution of lepers amounted in the first census to 3.5 per ten thousand and to less for 1881. On the other hand, along the Tapti a high ratio is found. Now since also along the seaboard and larger rivers the prevalence of leprosy on an average is much below that of the inland areas, it cannot be said that the earlier enumerations estab- lish any proof in favour of the statement that in India the disease has a preference for the former tracts. These were, however, the only figures at the disposal of writers previous to the recent census. The records of the latter argue equally, if not more strongly, against the prevalence of leprosy along the shores of the sea or the banks of the large rivers. In the "doabs" the ratios are again low, and the same applies to the north-west coast and the seaboard in general. The map, however, gives a more graphic demonstration than words possibly can do, and reference should be made to the same. III.-The maps convey the further information that some hill tracts are especially attacked by leprosy. This fact can- not be explained by immigration from adjoining native terri- tories,-though this is responsible to a great degree for the high ratios in some districts,-but is apparently due to certain inherent conditions. The influence of immigration will be discussed later on. In all the three census reports some Himalayan districts show consistently a dense leper popula-

It is true that in the Himalayan districts of the Punjab the inhabitants do so more or less, but it must be remembered that many of their most densely populated places are at an height of from seven to eight thousand feet, and villages may be even found at a height of ten thousand feet.10 On the other hand, it must not be thought that leprosy is most frequent in the hills, for in the plains parts are found with an exceedingly high ratio of leper population, as a glance at the maps for 1881 and 1891 will show.

48 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Hence, with regard to the geographical distribution of leprosy in India, it cannot be said that the sea coast, riparian areas or large valleys are affected more than other districts in the country. The disease attacks all tracts impartially, and so far as the surface relations are concerned no generalisations whatever can be made. Similarly no connexion can be traced between the geological formations and the density or distribution of the leper population. These lines may suffice as mere outlines of the geographical distribution of leprosy in India, which may be studied more completely by careful reference to the maps and the appendix than by a lengthy exposition and cumbersome statistics. Increase of Leprosy. In Table I the Feudatory States have been omitted, for the reason stated above. For completeness' sake a table was added to show the ratios of lepers for British as well as Feudatory territory (Table I-a.) In comparing the figures of the three censuses with a view to studying the changes in the leper population from one decade to another, it must be remembered that the later censuses included districts and areas which were omitted in the earlier ; again, that the first census was not taken on the same day or at the same time all over India ; and that also as time progresses the diagnostic powers of the people have improved. To investigate the movement in the leper population, Table I-b has been constructed, including under each census only those districts which were enumerated on all three occasions. But even then it must not be left out of sight that changes in the divisions themselves have taken place from time to time, one district having been given over from one division to another. Selecting, however, as carefully as possible those districts for which returns were made at all three censuses, the Table I-b permits of a comparison being made
?Distribution of Leprosy. 49 of the three sets of figures available. Even making all due allowances for errors, omissions, and changes in areas, it is plain that the recent outcry about an alarming increase of leprosy in British India is not based on fact, and that such increase has not taken place. On the other hand, the figures suggest a decrease rather than an increase, especially if it be remembered that immigration of lepers into British territory takes place to a great extent. TABLE I-b. Increase of Leprosy in British India. Total population at each census on which the leper-ratios  have been calculated. Number of  Lepers. Ratio per  10,000. Remarks. 1st Census (1867-72).   Only those districts and areas have been selected which were enu- merated in  all censuses. To facil- itate   calculation  round  numbers have been used, and the ratios  are approximate  only.  It   has   been assumed that the number of lepers in   the Central Provinces has re- mained stationary.                                     182,000,000 100,000    50      2nd Census (1881).    191,000,000 115,000 60  3rd Census (1891).    210,000,000 105,000    50   In arguing from this table great care must be employed. Comparing the first two censuses, there is an increase in the absolute number of lepers of fifteen thousand. The present enu- meration, on the other hand, shows a great decrease, both abso- lute and relative, since the previous census, so that the recent alarm is quite unnecessary. While comparing the first two censuses, it must be remembered that on both occasions the diagnosis was greatly at fault, and that the presidencies on the first occasion were enumerated at different times. But even allowing the figures to be genuine, the increase is so small that it may easily be explained on the ground of faulty counting. For one mistake in ten thousand, or if the ac- tual figures be taken, one mistake in twenty thousand would more than account for the increase of fifteen thousand. After all this increase, when compared with the total E
50 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: population, is but slight and too small to stamp leprosy as an "Imperial Danger." For an increase of fifteen thousand means that of the population, after an interval varying from nine to fourteen years, less than 0001 became diseased. Such an increase, if it actually existed, can hardly be considered in the light of a danger. According to Table I the ratios of lepers per ten thousand of the population for the two periods were 5.5 and 6.0 respectively, a sufficiently strong argument against a rapid growth of leprosy. But the outcry about an alarming development of the pest becomes unreasonable, when the previous censuses are compared with the recent one, which shows an actual decrease. It has been said above, that on the recent occasion greater care has been bestowed on the correctness of diagnosis and though cases undoubtedly have been omitted by the enumera- tors, fewer spurious ones have been admitted. This only shows how difficult it is to come to a correct opinion by means of a comparison of a few figures. But those who have raised the alarm have had no other means of verifying their premises than these census returns. It may be safer to suspend all judgment, but if a verdict is given on so grave a matter, it should be capable of the only proof existing at the present time, viz., that afforded by the census figures. In the opinion of this Commission, a comparison of the first two censuses hardly points to an increase of leprosy, especially when it is considered that the first enumeration on account of its novelty was most likely more faulty, and not even taken at the same time all over India, and that an increase of .5 per ten thousand may be explained by the improved methods of enumeration. The errors of diagnosis were more or less equal for the two censuses. Again, while during the period from 1867 to 1881 the leper population remained probably more or less stationary, in the last decade there has been a decided decrease, according to the figures available. But it would be equally unsafe to assume that this represents an actual diminution of leprosy, for, as
Distribution of Leprosy. 51 was said above, great pains were taken in 1891 to exclude all cases of white leprosy. Loath to give a decided opinion on this subject, the Commission think, that the evidence of the censuses excludes the idea of an increase of leprosy, and points rather to a gradual decrease at the present time; but it may be safer to assume that the diffusion of this disease has remained stationary. Anyhow an "Imperial Danger" leprosy has not become as yet, for the previous increase is more than counterbalanced by the present decrease, as far as census figures go. A comparative statement of the leper population arranged according to divisions follows (Table IV), and a map is ap- pended tc show the changes in the ratios since the second census (Map IV). Pink represents an increase, and light blue a decrease, in the leper density since 1881, the darker shades indicating that such increase or decrease has taken place since the first enumeration. The map has been compiled ac- cording to the ratios of the last two censuses, and should be compared with a similar one in Chapter VI showing the increase and decrease from the first to the second census on more general lines. It will be seen from Map IV that, broadly speaking, there has been a steady decrease of leprosy, as estimated by the census returns, in Bombay and Madras Pre- sidencies, in the Punjab, North-Western Provinces, Lower Burma and Coorg, dark blue predominating over these areas. Since the last enumeration a general decrease is noticed in Bengal, while in Mysore and a few other tracts a slight increase has taken place. There are but few districts (dark red) in which the leper population has steadily increased during the last thirty years. The increase from 1881 to 1891 nowhere is great, and the ratios for 1891 are as a rule lower than those for 1867 and 1871. In studying the map it should be remembered that many districts were not enumerated on the first occasion, and careful reference should be made to the Appendix to this chapter. This, however, is evident from the E 2
52                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: map, that as far as census figures go, the relative decrease of leprosy since  1867 has been considerable. It must again be insisted upon that the Commissioners do by no means regard such figures as absolutely correct, but nevertheless as the best obtainable and of some value. To reject them altogether and to substitute numbers derived from general impressions of medical officers whose attention has been suddenly attracted to the disease, and from the study of dispensary returns is unreasonable. Again by others the figures are objected to and considered worthless, since in an enumeration the diagnosis is left in the hands of civil and police authorities. No doubt this detracts greatly from their value, but as may be seen from the general remarks at the com- mencement of this report, the fault consists generally in the inclusion of errors. The Commissioners found, that where cases had been collected for their inspection by non-medical men as a rule, about 10 per cent. had to be rejected on account of a mistaken diagnosis. It may thus be claimed, with a fair amount of justness that whatever errors the census returns contain, they do not under-estimate the true state of affairs by much, if at all. But in any case, as has been said at the beginning of this section, those who have spoken of an alarming increase could not support their assertion except by the figures of the first and second censuses. The highest estimates of the actual leper population at the present time have been two hundred and fifty thousand and five hundred thousand (11) and this, if true, would point to an enormous in- crease since 1881. But such calculations are based on impres- sions only and are mere guesses of extremely questionable, if any, value. The lepers in India have been enumerated on three different occasions, each time by different men and under altered condi- tions, and yet we find that the figures of the three censuses agree as much as can be expected.

Distribution of Leprosy. 53 was somewhere about a hundred thousand in 1871 and this the original estimate has already been confirmed at two separate periods. This fact must clearly enhance whatever absolute value the figures may possess, and allowing that such differences as there are from census to census cannot be considered sufficiently conclusive to establish an actual increase or decrease, the only conclusion that can be supported by anything like logical evidence is that from a hundred thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand more or less accurately represents the leper population, and also that though it may be safer to assume that the latter has remained stationary, there is at least a marked tendency towards a gradual relative decrease.

?Distribution of Leprosy. 57 Climate and Leprosy. The climate, or more correctly speaking the climates, of India vary considerably in passing from east to west, or in comparing the extreme north with the most southerly pro- vinces. Meaning by the term "climate" the average of the weather as hot or cold, dry or moist, at different seasons of the year, a brief enquiry will be made as to its possible influ- ence on the distribution of leprosy. Climate cannot be considered the cause of the disease, for leprosy exists in all latitudes. By comparing the various districts of India, how- ever, the atmospheric influences upon the malady may be more efficiently studied. It must not be forgotten that while discussing the relation between climate and leprosy in so vast a country, it is impossible to exclude all such factors as food, race, soil, and habits of the people. Leprosy is undoubtedly more common between the tropics than in the temperate zones. India, lying half within the tropics, is nowhere free from this disease. Still the distribu- tion of leprosy is very unequal, and it may be asked whether any law can be established between the dryness and heat of the climate and the number of the leper population. To take dryness first. "The west coast of the Peninsula is very damp, whereas most of the Madras districts on the east coast, and still more those in the interior, have a compa- ratively dry climate. But the driest part of the Peninsula is the tableland around Bellary, the northern district of Mysore, and that part of the Bombay Presidency that lies between the West- ern ghts and the Hyderabad State. In Northern India the contrast of dryness and dampness is even greater than in the Peninsula. Sind, with the South-Western Punjab and Western Rajputana, is exceedingly dry, so much so that large tracts are desert and devoid of vegetation, and agriculture is very
58               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: precarious, except where the land can be irrigated from the rivers. On the other hand, Cachar and Assam are the dampest provinces in India; they have no dry hot season like most other parts of India, and vegetation is green and luxuriant all through the year. Between these extremes the dampness of the climate increases gradually from west to east. Thus Eastern Raj- putana, Central India, and the North-Western Provinces are less dry than Sind and the Punjab, and their eastern districts less so than their western; Behar and Chota Nagpore, which lie to the east of these, are still damper, and Bengal much more so, especially its eastern districts and those bordering on the sea. The dampness of the climate increases also every- where on approaching the Himalaya, and lofty hills are always damper than the plains."12 Looking at the three leprosy distribution maps, it seems that actually the smallest proportions of lepers are found in the driest areas. Thus undoubtedly there is less leprosy in the Madras districts of the east coast than on the west coast, and in Sind and the South-West Punjab the ratio of lepers to the healthy population is lower than in any other part of India. Again, in Bengal a great amount of leprosy prevails, and it may be said that, in general, passing from west to east an increase in the relative leper population can be easily traced. Of course, it is not maintained that the dryness of the climate is the sole, or even a chief, factor in the numerical distribution of the disease, yet it  must always remain a significant and suggestive fact that the leper ratios vary inversely with the dryness of the climate. This is especially well demonstrated by the censuses of 1881 and 1891. Table V is arranged according to the above extract from Blandford's  "Geography of India." (12)  H. E.

To enter more fully into this matter. The dryness of a climate depends chiefly on the temperature, humidity, and rainfall. No correspondence between the heat and the distribution of leprosy is traceable, as Table VI will show. For all the meteorological information the Commissioners are indebted to Mr. W. L. Dallas, Assistant Meteorological Reporter with the Government of India, who most obligingly gave  them all assistance, for which they here thank him :

Distribution of Leprosy. 61 A comparison of the appended map showing the annual mean temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) with the three leper distribution maps demonstrates clearly that no relation between leprosy and heat can be established, and it will thus be unnecessary to delay any further over this subject. A table will now be given to show the annual average of rainfall and humidity respectively, and this is further illustrated by a map :- TABLE VII. Annual Average Rainfall and Humidity. Area.

64 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Speaking generally, at either end of this table the extreme ratios are met with, while in the middle the intermediate ones are found. The series is only disturbed by the high proportions of Khandesh and Berar. In the appended map red represents the driest areas, while blue indicates the dampest, and yellow the intermediate ones. By comparing this map with the leper distribution maps a graphic demonstra- tion is given of what has been suggested above, that is, that there is an apparent connexion between the dryness of the climate and a small leper population; for it will be seen that in the four maps the red colours to a certain extent cover the same areas, while blue in the climate map occupies those spaces which in the other maps are darkly tinted, or at least other than red, thus indicating a greater amount of leprosy. Whether this is only accidental it is difficult to say, and perhaps too much importance must not be attached to it. It is not intended to advance any theory on the strength of these observations. Yet the fact seemed significant enough to de- serve especial mention, all the more as all three censuses bring out this general principle. Leprosy and the Increase and Decrease of Population. On the climate of a country to a great extent depend the health and wealth of the people. It is difficult to get a fair estimate of the comparative healthiness of the various districts of India, for it is impossible to do so by a study of the rates of increase or decrease of the population as registered in the Census Reports. This can in no way gauge with any amount of accuracy the rate of mortality which may be considered a pretty fair estimate of the healthiness of an area. Errors cannot be excluded while arguing in this manner, as the movement of the population depends not only on mortality, but also on many other factors. The observation of Malthus regarding the tendency of the population within a fixed area
Distribution of Leprosy. 65 to increase faster than the land yields food for it, is well known, and its truth in the present day is fully accepted. Physical and social influences greatly stimulate the multiplica- tion of a people. There is for many parts of this country the tropical climate, necessitating the barest requirements of food and clothing, the extent of cultivable soil, and the religious sanction or social influence that contains within itself all the vitality of the popular belief of the masses: there is lastly the retarding unprogressive form of Indian society which excludes all advance of a standard of comfort from one generation to another. As Mr. Baines writes in his excellent Report on the Census for the Presidency of Bombay13: "Under different circumstances the increase in material prosperity may have the result of either increasing or decreasing the population, and it is the same with a decrease in well-being. The differ- ence depends upon whether the standard according to which the people mould their life is that of subsistence or of mainte- nance. As regards India the special features to be taken into consideration are, first, the sharp and impassable social distinctions, in consequence of which the enterprising man is conscious that, however he may increase his wealth, his station is fixed for him by a barrier he cannot overstep; secondly, the fact that the religious obligation is imposed on all who profess the Hindu religion; thirdly, the place of the standard of comfort is here taken by that of expenditure on the half-social, half-religious ceremonies that are held to mark the performer's place amongst his caste-fellows. The motive of economy is not the desire of permanently ame- liorating the position of the man himself or his posterity, but of keeping up appearances for the occasion only." There is thus in India a large class whose standard of subsistence is of the lowest possible, and who are therefore (13) Imperial Census of 1881,-" Operations and Results in the Presidency of Bombay, including Sind," page 29.

66 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: unusually sensitive to the effects of disease, scarcity, or want of labour. There is an extraordinarily large proletariat living, and such agencies as famine or drought must reduce their numbers considerably. Again, the increased demand for labour removes people from those districts which supply a large portion of unskilled labour, and a large extent of unoccupied fertile land available for cultivation will attract numbers of people, as will also the increase of trade, by opening of rail- ways and so forth. All this must not be left out of sight in deducing from the rate of increase or decrease of the population the amount of mortality, and establishing from the latter the comparative healthiness of an area. All the Census Reports bring out this fact strongly that no connexion exists between the in- crease or decrease of the population and the leper ratios. The present enumeration, if an absolute value be attached to the figures, indeed shows that, though the general popula- tion has increased, the number of lepers has materially dimi- nished during the last decade. In the Census Reports for the Central Provinces14 means are given to study the effect of comparative healthiness of a district on the leper ratio. Mr. T. Drysdale has arranged the districts of the Central Pro- vinces in their order of annual rate of decrease, and it will be seen that in some of the healthiest districts there is the largest amount of leprosy, and the converse is also true. This will now be given in a tabular form. (11) Census of the Central Provinces, 1881, Vol. I, page 78.

70 Report of the Leprosy Commission: parative rate of mortality of the same on the other. How little, however, the rate of increase of a district is a test of its healthiness can be seen by comparing the approximate death- rate with the increase per cent. according to census figures. They have been given for the Central Provinces in the second column of Table IX. No tables have been constructed for 1891, as almost all leper ratios have decreased since the last enumeration. In the Punjab, for instance, while the popula- tion has increased by about 10 per cent. during the last ten years, the number of lepers has decreased by about 35 per cent. The death rate is dependent to a great extent on climate epidemic fevers, endemic diseases, and similar conditions, and it might a priori be expected that the diffusion of leprosy could not depend on such causes per se, though the condi- tions leading to the constant presence of a specific disease in any particular area may possibly cause a special predisposition towards leprosy. The factors to be considered are the per- sonal health and wealth of the individual, and the degree to which he is liable to suffer from such diseases as are caused by bad nourishment, poverty, overcrowding, and other speci- ally endemic conditions. To obtain such details is exceed- ingly difficult in a vast empire like India. Leprosy and Cholera. It was shown that from the healthiness of a district, de- duced from its rate of mortality, nothing could be argued as to the density of the leper population. Taking now cholera as a test of the climatic and local healthiness and sanitary state of an area, an enquiry will be made into the diffusion of leprosy over the regions stricken by this fever. It must not be thought that a direct connexion between these two diseases is suspected, or that it is intended to imply that the causes which lead to cholera bring about a totally different morbid condition. While searching for a possible explanation of the high leper ratios for certain parts of Bengal,
Distribution of Leprosy. 71 the following enquiry suggested itself,-Why should the Burd- wan Division consistently show almost the highest relative number of lepers? Again, why should leprosy be so generally prevalent over Lower and Eastern Bengal and Burma? One striking feature which these districts have in common is the perennial existence of cholera and fever. Areas where such diseases rage at all times and seasons cannot be considered healthy, and must present certain permanent specific condi- tions, whatever view may be held regarding the tiology of these fevers. Regions where cholera is endemic must be in the possession of certain definite, though at present perhaps un- known factors; and if it be found that in these regions leprosy is also common, may it not be possible that the deleterious conditions which cause the fever to be endemic, exercise a specific influence on the general health of the population?. In the present state of medical knowledge it is not decided how far bad health and hygiene, poverty and overcrowding predis- pose towards such diseases as leprosy and tuberculosis, but sufficient evidence exists to make it appear quite possible that such like agents play at least some, if not an important, part in the development of these affections. On this hypothe- sis it is not quite so irrelevant as it may appear at first sight to enquire into the correlation between leprosy and endemic cholera.  "Certain regions and tracts of country in India which bear a striking general similarity in respect to the main features of their physical aspects and climatic characteristics are much more favourable to the development of the epidemic activity of cholera than other regions and tracts of country in India which differ from them very essentially in the characteristic features of their physiography and meteorology, as well also as in point of density of population and the condition of the material prosperity of that population. In the former class of regions or tracts of country cholera is found to be more or less always active at all times and seasons, and is conse-
72 Report of the Leprosy Commission: quently, although subject to regularly recurring periods of epidemic intensity, considered an endemic disease in such regions or tracts of country. In the other class of regions or tracts of country cholera is not found to be always active at all times and seasons. On the contrary, in these areas it prevails only in seasons of periodically recurring general epi- demic diffusion of the disease, and consequently cholera in these regions and tracts of country is considered only an occa- sional visitor and an epidemic disease."15 Now, as explained above, the areas in which cholera is en- demic may be considered unhealthy in a general way, and this unhealthiness will depend to a certain extent on the climatic, geological, and meteorological conditions of such area, the density, prosperity, and general life and habits of the popula- tion. In this respect cholera may be assumed to be a better test of the health and wealth of a region than the decennial rate of mortality, which at best must always be an uncertain quantity for a vast country like India, and therefore quite inadequate as a standard of healthiness. Cholera is endemic in the whole of Bengal, especially in its low-lying districts, with alluvial soil, subject to periodical inundations or water-logging by seasonal floods of the great rivers, with moist and hot tropical and sub-tropical climate. In the whole of Assam, Behar, and Burma cholera is always found. According to Dr. Bellew the disease is endemic in the following districts: the great river deltas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra in Bengal and Assam; of the Mahanadi in Orissa; the interfluvial tracts of Behar; the deltas of the Irrawaddy and Salween in Burma, which means practically the whole of Lower Burma; to a less degree the deltas of the Godavari, Kistna, and Kaveri; the coast districts of Malabar and Konkan; Oudh and the Southern Gangetic districts of the North-Western Provinces as far up as Allahabad, and still less (15) H.

Of all these districts, Bengal, especially Lower Bengal, Assam, Lower Burma, Behar, and the specified parts of the North- Western Provinces and Oudh may be singled out, the last- mentioned being the least visited by cholera. In the appended Cholera Map of India the endemic areas are tinted dark blue. It will be seen that here the tracts where cholera is always found, and at all seasons, cover a smaller area than those enumerated by Dr. Bellew. The map has been constructed according to a similar one in the Sanitary Com- missioner's Reports, and may be taken to express the views generally accepted by Indian medical officers. However, it is only fair to state both opinions, so as to avoid all exclusiveness or prejudice. A tabular survey will facilitate the study of the leper density in these areas. TABLE  XII.

Consider- ing Bengal alone, the highest ratios are found in Burdwan, Bankoora, Beerbhoom, Hooghly, Moorshedabad, Rungpore, in all of which the health, as estimated by the prevalence of cholera, is exceedingly bad, the Burdwan District being perhaps the worst in this respect. The leper ratios of Bengal, Burma, Assam, and Orissa are among the highest in the empire, and in Madras those of the choleraic districts are higher than those of cholera-free areas, with the exception of Kistna and Tri- chinopoly. Cholera, however, is not exceptionally virulent in this presidency. The ratios for Konkan are very much above the averages for Bombay, and Jullundur has the densest leper population in the Punjab. It is only possible to argue on broad lines, and all ex- clusiveness must be carefully avoided. Here, as in the rest of this chapter, the great difficulties which necessarily exist in a survey of so large a continent are keenly felt, and all that
Distribution of Leprosy. 75 is said must merely be taken as suggestions worthy of future consideration. It seems, however, that in those areas and regions in which cholera is worst and endemic, the leper diffu- sion is also greatest. The facts concerning Lower Bengal, Assam, and Burma, which are the worst fever districts of India, and at the same time, taken as a whole, the most afflicted with leprosy, may suggest that causes exist  here which lower the health and vitality of the population, and thus pre- dispose it towards this disease. The special agents concerned in the development of cholera are manifold: climate, poverty, overcrowding amongst them. But all these must contribute to a bad hygiene and diminished resistance against infective processes. It may be assumed that where cholera is worst the hygiene and physical powers of the people are lowest. If this be so, and Burma, Lower Bengal, Assam, and Orissa, on the strength of this, considered hygienically the most unsound districts, this fact may be accepted amongst others to explain the great amount of leprosy in such districts as Burdwan, Assam, and Burma. A comparison of the leper distribution maps with the cho- lera map will still further illustrate this matter. The dark blue area in the latter represents those regions where the disease is strictly endemic, while over the lighter areas the disease is rather an epidemic than a constant feature. It will be seen that the districts of Burdwan, Beerbhoom, Midnapore, Moorshedabad, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Rungpore, Sylhet, and Cachar, in which leprosy prevails most extensively, are all situated in the area of endemic cholera. And though the statement is subject to exceptions, it may be said that more or less the dark blue areas on the cholera map correspond to those tinted other than red in the leper distribution maps. An absolute harmony, even if this theory hold good, cannot be expected, especially over those tracts where cholera is hardly endemic, as here the conditions responsible for an outbreak are not constant. Again, as will be shown later on, a famine
76 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: immediately before a census may possibly disturb the unifor- mity of ratios. Thus perhaps it is fairest to argue from the extremes only. These tend to show that, generally speaking, in those districts which, on account of the endemic appearance of cholera, certainly rank amongst the unhealthiest in India, leprosy is very prevalent, while over those areas where there is little or no cholera (which are represented in red) the leper population likewise is smaller. As was explained above, a causal connexion between leprosy and cholera is not hinted at, but it is quite possible that the same noxia which cause one district to be more attacked by cholera than another have also a deleterious effect on the vital powers and general condi- tion of their population in other directions. Leprosy and Famines. The great famine which raged over the southern provinces of India no doubt effected grave changes in the population, destroying thousands of lives and reducing the health of the community. The famine extended over the years 1876 to 1878, and attacked especially the Madras Presidency, but partly also Bombay. Taking the former first, according to the Census Report of 1881, there were nine districts which suffered, while the remaining thirteen were spared altogether. But while among the non-famine districts a relative increase of leprosy, according to a comparison of the first two censuses can be established in eight instances, this is only possible in two out of nine of the famine districts. Among the eight unfortunate Bombay districts an increase could not be traced in a single case, but, on the contrary, as in Madras, in the majority of famine districts an appreciable decrease is ob- servable. The loss of population for the southern presidency amounted to 13 per cent. on the previous census, and the population was 18 per cent. below what it ought to have been. It is therefore possible that lepers under such unfavourable conditions died in large numbers, for of twelve districts in the
Distribution of Leprosy. 77 Bombay Presidency, in which the leper ratios diminished, seven were struck by the famine, while of nine similar districts in the other presidency six were visited. It is of course im- possible to estimate the actual influence of such distressful conditions in this manner, as all the information required regarding the number of lepers who died during those years cannot be obtained, and the recent census throws but little light on this question. A table is appended to show the possible effect of the famine on the leper population. TABLE XIII. Famine and Leprosy. Presidency.  District.  Leper Ratios after famine (2nd Census).

78 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: In estimating the value of these figures too much import- ance must not be attached to a small increase or decr ease, but ratios which differ but little must be considered as represent- ing a persistence of former conditions, since an increase or decrease of less than one in ten thousand is practically inappre- ciable, and moreover may easily be explained by unavoidable errors in any large enumeration. In Madras, therefore, the leper population can hardly be said to have changed. Here, however, a famine occurred also in 1865 and 1866, and thus matters may have been equalised. The difficulty of arguing from census statistics must not be lost sight of, and due allow- ance be made for errors in observation and enumeration. Again, in the year 1866 there was a severe famine over Lower Bengal. During this year throughout Orissa the average price of rice, the staple food of the population, varied from thirteen seers in January to five seers, and even less than five seers, in August. The famine was confined to the districts of Manbhoom, Singbhoom, Bankoora, Nuddea, Midnapore, and the 24-Pergunnahs, in which it was less severe, and was most intense in Orissa. The failure of the harvests for three suc- cessive years, especially in Orissa and Tirhoot, and the high price of food in consequence thereof, had made the distress still greater, so that in some parts the poorer classes were reduced to living on the seeds and berries of wild trees, grass, and herbs. That understraitened conditions, as are implied by a famine, the leper has but little chance of survival is highly probable. Up to 1871, and even to 1881, the price of food remained high over Bengal, so that the comparative health of the people was kept at a low standard, and if bad conditions of life have any influence on the development of leprosy, there should be an increase in the leper ratios after they had pre- sumably been greatly reduced by the severe famine of 1866. Comparing the census returns for 1872 and 1881, it is found that in the first census after the famine the ratios were com- paratively low, in any case, with the exception of Gya, lower
?Distribution of Leprosy. 79 than in 1881, while in the latter year in many regions there was a remarkable increase. One explanation which suggests itself is, that the severe distress of 1866 and the previous years decimated the lepers, while the unfavourable conditions during the next ten years affected the population in such a manner as to make it more liable to contract leprosy. The following table gives the districts of Lower Bengal which suffered from the severe famine in 1866 and the leper ratios for the first two censuses. The difference in the ratios, even allowing for imperfections in the enumeration, is remark- able. With regard to Gya it must be remembered that some parts of this district suffered much less than others, and that the famine practically raged only in the western and southern parts:- TABLE XIV.

?80 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Discussing this question more generally, it will be found that a famine, shortly before a census, apparently has a ten- dency to reduce the leper ratio for such province, provided that the census returns are considered sufficiently accurate. The enumerations occurring only once in every ten years, it is impossible to check the figures in anything like a satisfac- tory manner. Hence in all arguments two courses are open, viz., either to discredit the value of the ratios altogether, or to concede to them a relative value of fairly sufficient accuracy. If the former view be taken all the preceding and following de- ductions are not worthy of consideration. If within certain limits they are regarded as a more or less true comparative statement of the leper diffusion, then it is necessary to explain the differences in the ratios over different areas and in suc- cessive censuses. For the present considerations and deduc- tions, the latter more optimistic view has been taken, leaving it, however, to the option of others to choose between the two alternatives. In the Central Provinces there was severe distress during the years of 1868 and 1869, while in the period between the first two censuses no scarcity occurred. It is found that in 1872 the leper ratio amounted to only 2.7, as against 6.5 in 1881. In the Bombay Presidency an intense famine raged for two years shortly before the second enumeration, and the leper proportion in 1881 was 2.4 per ten thousand less than in 1872. In the North-Western Provinces a severe famine passed over the districts in 1868 and 1869, and a less severe one in 1877 and 1878; and it is seen that the ratios remained low and nearly equal for the two censuses, and the same applies to Madras with its famines of 1865 and 1866, and 1876-1878, respectively. On the other hand, in Berar, where there has been no famine, the proportions were high on both occasions, especially so in 1881. "The parts of the country which, from the abundance and certainty of the rainfall, or from other conditions of climate, or

These are tinted red, while blue represents all those visited by famine since 1860, the dark blue having suffered at least twice, the North-Western Provinces alone having been subjected more than twice to such distressful conditions since that time. The numbers indicate the years in which famines visited the re- spective regions. The following table will assist to elucidate these points:- TABLE XV. Famine and Leprosy. PROVINCE. Famines.

At first sight the Punjab appears to be an exception to the above assumption that a famine before a census possibly causes an appreciable diminution in the number of lepers. But it must be remembered that here the first census took place in 1868, so that the more intense famine worked its effect on the leper population after the enumeration. This famine was very severe in Hansi, Hissar, Rohtak, and Karnal districts,
Distribution of Leprosy. 83 and the distress was exacerbated by the " intensity of famine17 over so great an area as that of Rajputana, which raised prices to an excessive height and drained away the diminished food- stocks; while the influx of emigrants from those parts added to the severe strain on the charity of the public. Distress was so intense that 23,000 received gratuitous relief daily for nine months at a cost of R4,250,000, and about three lakhs of rupees of land revenue were remitted. The mortality was greatly in excess over that of previous years." Of the famine in 1877-78 the Report of the Famine Commission18 says "that the failure of the monsoon of 1877 was very complete in the Punjab, but the autumn crop is less important there than in any other part of India, and the rain of October made it possible to sow the usual area with spring crops. Moreover the preceding years had been very prosperous, and the export of wheat, which had greatly increased in the years 1876 and 1877, brought large sums of money to the province. The scarcity, however, became serious in some  places through the height to which prices had risen in conse- quence of the famine of the south, and by reason of the influx of starving people from Kashmir. The parts which suffered most from the drought were those districts of the Delhi and Hissar Divisions not protected by the Western Jumna Canal which are always among the first affected, and the hill district of Hazara, which had not been known to suffer in any earlier famine. The distress was, however, nowhere intense; the or- dinary measures were taken to supply relief, and with the rains of 1878 all fear of famine passed away. The mortuary returns, however, which indicate an excess mortality of about 340,000 above the average during the year 1878, afford reason for fearing that the high prices had a grievous effect on the poorer classes of the population." It will thus be seen that the Punjab forms no exception to the opinion expressed above, (17) Report of the Indian Famine Commission, Part 1, page 15. (18) Ibidem, pages 20 and 21. G2
?84 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: that a famine before a census may possibly affect the relative diffusion of leprosy over a given area, and this point must not be left out of sight in the study of the tiology of the disease by a comparison of the density of the leper population in various presidencies or provinces. During seasons of distress, such as it is perhaps only known in India, life is reduced to a struggle for existence, and herein the leper must succumb quickly, partly on account of his own miserable condition, partly on account of the poverty of his fellowmen, which com- pels them to withhold the helping hand. All these considera- tions demonstrate the difficulties of an enquiry into the relative frequency of leprosy in a country of such vastness as India, subject to periodical calamities altogether unknown in Western Europe, and capable of destroying large numbers of people in a short time. And they also show that those who argue impli- citly from census figures must not lose sight of any cause or event which may materially affect such figures and thus decrease their comparative value. Those who realise these points will exercise forbearance with the Commissioners with regard to the many shortcomings in the report, and especially in this chapter, where India is discussed as an unit : they will also understand why matters of great importance have only been alluded to, and all arguments kept on the broadest lines, in many cases being suggestions and hints rather than deduc- tions. To recapitulate: the purport of these considerations was to show that it is not sufficient to compare two provinces of different leper ratios and then, by a contrast of the physical, economic, and other conditions of these provinces, suggest one particular feature which is found in the area with the higher ratio, as an tiological factor. When such large tracts are dealt with, the ratios alone are not sufficient to allow of deduc- tions being made as to the proneness of a district to leprosy. Firstly, the size of the Indian provinces demands great caution in all conclusions and arguments. If it be remembered that
?Distribution of Leprosy. 85 Bengal is almost as large as Spain, that the Punjab, and the North-Western Provinces, respectively, occupy only 15,000 and 8,000 square miles less than the whole British Isles, and that Bombay covers an area nearly twice as great as Great Britain and Ireland, an idea may be formed of the difficulties, it might almost be said futility, of drawing general deductions. Secondly, districts must be selected where such interferences as severe and intense famines can be excluded, and more or less equally situated areas should be contrasted. It now remains to examine how far the above statements are borne out by the present census. Since the great famine in 1876 and 1878 no great distress has occurred in any part of India. The conditions have changed much since that time; railways have been opened all over the country and inter-communication is greatly facilitated; a famine relief fund has been inaugurated to prevent a recurrence of such disaster. Prices and wages are being equalised all over India, and it is certain that the personal condition of the population is bettering itself from year to year, partly on account of increased commerce within and without, partly on account of an improved hygiene. There can be no possible doubt that thanks to the foresight and care of the Indian Government a repetition of the disasters of 1866 and 1876 need not be feared, and that the general conditions of people at large are greatly ameliorated. Sir William Hunter19 discusses this question well in his usual eloquent style. He writes: " The in- creased material prosperity of the people, the growth of foreign trade, the inter-communications with town life, and the oppor- tunities these give for better and more varied subsistence, must have wrought beneficial changes in the population. Then again the gradual spread of western knowledge, education, and sani- tary reformation visible in all parts of the country must contri- bute towards an improvement. The improvement in means of communication, by the construction of railways and metalled (19) imperial Gazetteer, Volume VI pages 593 and 594.
?86 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: roads, has directly developed internal, no less than foreign trade. Facilities for rapid carriage tend to equalise prices, not only over large areas of country, but also over long periods of time. As wheeled carts supersede pack-bullocks, and as railroads super- sede carts, the whole of India will gradually become one country for the purposes of food supply. It is by this means alone that a guarantee can be provided against the ravages of famine. "The vicissitudes of a tropical climate will always cause local failures of the harvest, whether by drought or by flood, which science, indeed, may learn to foresee, but which no prac- ticable schemes of irrigation or embankment can altogether avert. But India as a whole has never yet been unable, in any single year, to yield sufficient food for her population. The real problem of famine is a problem of distribution. " In former times the inhabitants of one district might be perishing of starvation, while plenty reigned in a district but a hundred miles distant. In 1866 the people of Orissa were decimated, not so much by drought or by inundation, as by the impossibility of transport. In 1877 the distress in Madras was alleviated by the importation of nearly one million tons of grain, all of which was carried inland by two lines of rail in twelve months. Supplies were drawn, not only from the seaboard of Bengal and Burma, but from the most remote provinces. In the year 1877-78 the Central Provinces exported grain to the amount of more than three hundred thousand tons, and the Punjab to the amount of four hundred thounsand tons, all of which were conveyed south by rail. Trade has never known such a stimulus as was afforded on this occasion when the carry- ing power proved barely equal to the strain. If the famine had happened before the opening of the railway it would have result- ed in a loss of life without parallel, even in the annals of India. "But the utility of local trade is not to be judged of only at such a crisis. In normal seasons it tends alike to regulate prices and to promote a higher standard of comfort. Within the last twenty-five years the cultivators have learnt, for the
?Distribution of Leprosy. 87 first time, the real value of their produce. In the old days little was grown beyond grain crops for the year's food. The slightest failure meant local distress, while a bumper harvest so depreciated the value of grain that part of the crops was often left unreaped to rot in the fields. In 1880 and 1881 a suspen- sion of revenue had to be granted to the district of Sylhet be- cause the harvest was so bountiful that it would not pay the cost of carriage to market, and consequently the farmers had no means of obtaining money. Even so late as 1873 the Collector of Rungpore reported that 'the yield of rice was considered too good by the ryats, as prices were there by kept down.' The extended cultivation of staples for export, such as cotton, jute, and oil-seeds, together with the substitution of more valuable crops for the inferior grains, is now modifying the entire system of Indian agriculture. Land is not being withdrawn from food crops to any appreciable extent, but the ryat is everywhere learning to cultivate high-priced subsidiary crops which will help to pay his rent." These changes in the well-being of the people are becom- ing more visible from year to year, and the general condition of the population has improved considerably during the last de- cade. Applying the results of the present census to this en- quiry into the possible effect on the leper density of a famine, it will be seen that there is an almost general decrease of leprosy all over the country. It is thus not necessary to encumber this chapter with further statistics and tables. What conclusions may be drawn from this change with re- gard to the question under discussion ? Two courses plainly are open. Firstly, it may be claimed that from a comparison of census figures no legitimate deductions can be drawn, as it is impossible to gauge the correctness of diagnosis and enu- meration. Any argument based on a comparison with the re- cent census especially may be questioned, as this year errors were excluded as rigorously as possible. Again the decrease in the leper population in the majority of famine districts,
?88 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: according to this last enumeration, may be said to destroy the whole value of the above suggestions. Secondly, those who, after making due allowance for errors, attach more value to census figures may assert that with the improvement of the condition of the people a diminution of leprosy has taken place. The latter, however, as explained above, must not be considered to be so large as the figures seem to indicate, the census on the present occasion having been taken much more critically. Poverty and Leprosy. Undoubtedly leprosy attacks the poor and destitute much more frequently than the rich and prosperous, not that the latter are spared altogether, but they certainly suffer to a far less degree. Again good nourishment and care are most im- portant agents in the treatment of the disease, ameliorating the general, as well as the local, conditions of the patient, and keeping the destructive pro cesses in abeyance. It may thus reasonably be asked, whether or no the leper ratios vary with the material prosperity of the masses. It is not sufficient to compare two provinces or presidencies with each other, as the areas are too vast, and thus the conclusions and state- ment too general. The best mode of procedure which sug- gests itself is to examine the various districts of several pro- vinces, and subsequently select those regions where leprosy is highly prevalent, and enquire into their economic conditions, and conversely investigate, in like manner, those tracts which present the smallest leper population according to all cen- suses. It is extremely difficult to obtain accurate data regarding the relative prosperity of Indian districts. The whole empire being, generally speaking, overcrowded, and the areas of cul- tivable land insufficient for the large masses of an agricultural population, shows everywhere the most unmistakable signs of poverty, as the term would be understood by western nations. India cannot be called a rich and prosperous country, but
?Distribution of Leprosy. 89 there are great differences in this respect as regards the vari- ous districts. The wealth of a country, besides other stand- ards, must be estimated by -the area and revenue returns, the density of the population, the trade and wages, food-supply, and the support that it can offer to the increasing population. This implies a special knowledge and a long experience, such as cannot be gained by a temporary stay in India. But even all these data cannot supply absolutely correct information regarding the wealth or poverty of the masses. Since more than two-thirds of the population of India are supported by cultivation, the best mode of judging the condi- tion of the people is an enquiry into the agriculture and pro- ducts of the various provinces. "The cultivation of the soil forms the occupation of the Indian people in a sense which it is difficult to realise in England. As the land-tax forms the mainstay of the imperial revenue, so the 'ryat,' or cultivator constitutes the unit of the social system. The village con- tains many members besides the cultivator, but they all exist for his benefit, and all are maintained from the produce of the village fields. Even in considerable towns, the traders and handicraftsmen frequently possess plots of land of their own, on which they raise sufficient grain to supply their families with food. The census of 1881 returned a total of 51, 274, 586 males as engaged in agriculture throughout British and Feu- datory India. Adding to these seven and a quarter million of adult day labourers, there is a total of upwards of fifty eight and a half million persons directly supported by cultivation, or 72 per cent. of the whole male population engaged in some specified occupation. The number of persons indirectly connected with agriculture is also very great. The Famine Commissioners estimate that 90 per cent. of the rural popula- tion live more or less by the tillage of the soil. India is, therefore, almost exclusively a country of peasant farmers."20 (20) Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol. VI, page 482.
?90 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: On such a population, imbued with fixed prejudices, the increase of population must have a great influence, and this is noticed in the development of a large landless class. " The cultivated area no longer suffices to allow a plot of land for each peasant ; and multitudes now find themselves ousted from the soil. They earn a poor livelihood as day labourers, and, according to the census of 1881, comprise 7,248,491, or one- eighth of the entire adult male population. There is still enough land in India for the whole people, but the Indian peasant clings to his native district, however over-crowded. Migration or emigration has hitherto worked on too small a scale to afford a solution of the difficulty."21 No connexion can be traced between the density22 of the population taken by itself and the amount of leprosy in a dis- trict, and in like manner, a dense rural population does in no way predispose an area to the disease. This is fully borne out by the census reports, and it will not be necessary to add further statistical proof. In estimating the material prosperity of the various pro- vinces, general impressions and the experience of Government officials most familiar with the country must be the guides of argument. Information as accurate as possible was obtained from the area and revenue returns, and from facts supplied by Mr. J. A. Baines, Imperial Census Commissioner, Mr. J. E. O'Conor, Assistant Secretary of the Government of India in the Department of Finance and Commerce, and others. Yet the following remarks can only be general, and are intended chiefly to suggest a line of enquiry into the tiology of the disease worthy of the consideration of those who, through long continuous residence, are in a position to make themselves more familiar with the economic conditions of the empire. Bengal is, as regards natural resources, the richest and most productive as well as the most populous province of India. (21) Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol. VI, page 483. (22) V. infra.
?Distribution of Leprosy. 91 With but few exceptions the whole of the Bengal plain is richly cultivated. Chota Nagpore and a part of Southern Behar are elevated and hilly, and up to the middle of this century the whole of this country was a very wild tract of hill and forest, and Chota Nagpore is still so in a great measure. Assam, though in possession of fertile soil, must be considered poor, with large areas of unreclaimed land, being backward and inaccessible, and with very deficient means of inter-com- munication. " Upper Assam is still mainly either forest or marsh with gigantic grass ; the latter to a width of from six to twenty miles on the borders of the river, the former on the higher ground and the adjacent hills. The marsh land when cleared is converted into rice fields, and tea-gardens are estab- lished in clearings in the forest, but these are of insignificant extent in proportion to the unreclaimed land. "23 The North- Western Provinces and Oudh are next to Bengal Proper the richest and most populous tracts of British India. " There are but few portions of country that are not capable of yielding two crops annually to the tillage of its industrious peasants."24 Judging from the absence of severe famines in most parts of the territory the Central Provinces must be considered pro- sperous. " The Wardha valley produces some of the finest cotton in India ; the Nerbadda Valley in the cold season is a vast spread of wheat and pulse crops, and the Chhattisgarh plain, the granary of Central India, is equally prolific of rice and wheat. The forests yield valuable teak and sl timbers, bamboo, stick-lac for the manufacture of lac, gum, and dye, tusser silk, and tanning materials."25 Burma again is very fertile and never subjected to such distressful conditions as scarcity or famines. It is difficult to speak in general terms about Bombay and Madras. In any case these few remarks show that through a consideration of this nature, on such (23) H. E. Blandford. Op. cit., pages 94 and 95. (24) H. E. Blandford. Op. cit., page 71. (25) H. E. Blandford. Op. cit., page 121.
?92 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: general lines, nothing is gained. Between the natural richness and fertility of a province and the leper population no connexion can be traced. From them also the material prosperity of the masses cannot be deduced. With regard to the former point it will be seen that in the richest province, Bengal Proper, the leper ratios are very high; in the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces below the average. But when such factors as famines, scarcity, density of population, decrease of labour and wages are taken cognisance of, it will at once be seen that the natural capability of an area to support its inhabitants cannot be a test of the well-being of the people. Leprosy is undoubtedly a disease which affects the masses more than the wealthy. It may be impossible to give statistics proving this statement beyond all doubt, but nevertheless, for India at least the fact exists, and the most exclusive con- tagionist would hardly venture to deny this. It may be asked whether those districts where the disease is commonest are also the poorest. Leprosy is undoubtedly most prevalent in Bengal Proper, and especially so in the Burdwan, Bankoora, and Beer- bhoom districts of the Burdwan Division. Now, as regards agricultural conditions, Bengal is the richest province in India, and Burdwan in this respect not inferior to other divisions in the presidency. But the material prosperity of an area cannot be gauged in this manner. It must be remembered that Ben- gal has the greatest specific population, about four hundred and seventy per square mile, that the three districts are like- wise overcrowded, four hundred and fifty-five hundred per square mile. Though the soil is most fertile and the crops most abundant, the proletariat is great and the land cannot supply food for all. Besides, these districts are most unhealthy, cholera and malarial fevers being endemic here. This may explain to a certain extent the great prevalence of leprosy. "The natural drainage is extremely deficient, and it is difficult to establish any artificial system. The result of the climate is a population and vegetation rank and luxuriant, and
?Distribution of Leprosy. 93 earth and air charged with decaying animal and vegetable matters. Life under such conditions must be unstable, and the quickly matured man must in every stage of his growth and decadence, even under the most happy circumstances, maintain a state of health perilously liable to become one of disease."26 Cholera and fever are the chief causes of mortality amongst the inhabitants of Bengal. "Insanitary conditions abound throughout rural Bengal, and have been only partially dealt with in the better class of towns. The dwellings of the poor, sessile on damp ground, are crowded, and if perchance clean within are surrounded by dirt-heaps and dirt-pools. Clothing is deficient, often dirty; the food is largely composed of un- wholesome material, and too generally is insufficient for the needs of the body, and the water is impure. Want, ignorance, and carelessness, or fatalism result in neglect of precautions against disease "27 Dr. Coates describes the population as "poor, ill, and insufficiently clad, badly fed, debilitated, and broken down in constitution."28 In the Chittagong Division the people are, for Bengal, an healthy and able-bodied race, thrifty and industrious, and in a condition of considerable pro- sperity, and here the smallest leper ratio of any Bengal division is found. Again in Rungpore the tracts where leprosy is extremely prevalent are characterised by marshy and uncul- tivable land, the people being of lazy habits and living in wretchedly built mat or grass huts, and miserably clothed. On the other hand, the areas of comparative immunity are extensive local plains covered with paddy, the inhabitants given to other pursuits besides agriculture. Trade here is pretty active, rice crops being abundant and exported to a great extent, while the people themselves are more civilised, feed and clothe themselves better.29 (26) F. N. Macnamara.

94 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Assam is a poor district, and the population, besides being exposed to unhealthy climatic and telluric conditions, live in poverty. Labour has to be imported, and the prices of food are high. The most prosperous districts of Assam are Darrang and Nowgong, and here the leper population is comparatively scanty. Burma also, though extremely fertile and never visit- ed by famines, cannot claim prosperity for her inhabitants. The Burman lives from hand to mouth, in poor sanitary conditions, and surrounded by filth. Peace and enterprise have worked considerable changes; a great improvement is visible all over British Burma, and with the opening up of railroads a further progress undoubtedly will take place. The leper ratios for Burma are high for the first two censuses, but amarked decrease has taken place since the first enumera- tion. The hill tracts are the home of an exceedingly poor people, living as a rule in filthy and unhygienic conditions, working as day labourers or coolies. It has been shown above that leprosy is common in these districts. In some of these immi- gration of lepers may account for an excessive ratio, but this is excluded in others, and no doubt the disease is particularly common in the Himalayan tracts. The Punjab and North-Western Provinces, considered as a whole, are prosperous tracts. Here leprosy is not very preva- lent, as compared with the rest of India. In the Bombay Presidency the smallest ratios are found in Sind. Here the climate is dry with extremes of temperature, the population omnivorous, and this division contains a considerable area of cultivable land, producing more than is required for the support of the existing population. Kaira, Broach, Dharwar, Kanara, Khandesh, Ahmedabad, and Belgaum, considering all things, are about the most prosperous areas, while Ratnagiri, Kaladgi, Ahmednagar, Sholapur, Satara, and Thana are per- haps the poorest. Comparing the leper ratios of these two groups it will be seen that the more prosperous areas, on
95 Distribution of Leprosy. an average, have the smaller ratios.    This will be shown in tabular form. TABLE XVI. Prosperity and Leprosy. DISTRICT. Ratio of lepers per 10,000 of population (1872).

It will be seen that, broadly speaking, the ratios under (A) are higher than those under (B). An absolute harmony can- not be expected, even if the present theory be correct, as all figures depend on the uncertainty of a general enumeration, however slight the errors for a particular district may be ; again famine may, as was above suggested, reduce the ratios ; and, thirdly, it is only possible to estimate the well being more or less approximately. In Kaladgi a great difference is noticed between the ratios of 1871 and 1881, but perhaps this is explained by the ravages of the great famine.    Khandesh
96 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION : has good soil and rainfall, but is not yet opened out and grows bad cotton ; and the conditions of Ahmedabad are variable, having part of the richest and also part of the least prosperous land of the presidency. With these remarks this sketchy review regarding the pos- sible relation between the density of the leper population and poverty must be concluded. A table is added wherein the districts of Bengal are arranged according to their prosperity. The required information has been gathered from Sir William Hunter's Statistical Account of Bengal. It must be ac- knowledged that this table contains at least some evidence in favour of the views expressed. TABLE XVII. Poverty and Leprosy.  PROSPEROUS DISTRICTS.

?Distribution of Leprosy. 97 Before proceeding to the remainder of this chapter it may be well to summarise the results arrived at. Attention must again be drawn to the many difficulties encountered. These depend in the first instance on the vastness of India, and an imperfect knowledge of all such matters as the habits and customs of the people and their material condition. Secondly, the census figures are only of relative value where numerical questions, such as the specific leper population, are under con- sideration. For the general distribution and prevalence of the disease they convey sufficiently accurate information, but for the study of more special points in the tiology of leprosy their value is perhaps not so great. At present only three sets of figures exist for India, and this is not sufficient to act as a safe check, especially as in a decennium many changes occur, capable of seriously affecting the ratios. To gauge the calculations and deductions based on them more efficiently returns should be made at frequent intervals-a matter of im- possibility. All that has been said on climate, cholera, and famine de- monstrates clearly that great caution must be exercised in all arguments regarding the numerical diffusion of leprosy. Though all these statements cannot be taken as absolute, and are not free from doubt and above criticism, they at least show that, in any comparison of two areas, all the concomitant conditions which may influence the population at large must be carefully considered; and this has been only too often neglected by those who raised the outcry about the rapid in- crease of leprosy in India. It has not been the intention of the Commissioners to convey the idea that a severe famine invariably does act on the leper population in a particular manner, but that it may do so, and if the census figures be correct, in many instances seems to do so. Again a particular climate has not been considered the cause of a scanty leper population, but it has been claimed that a climate, combined with the telluric, geological, ethnological, and other conditions H
?98 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: of a district, may have a definite influence. Cholera has been used as a test of unhealthiness and bad hygiene, and it has been suggested that in a district, the permanent home of cho- lera, the surroundings may be such as to favour the diffusion of leprosy. Still greater difficulties make themselves felt while discus- sing the relation between the material prosperity of the people and leprosy. The Commissioners incline greatly to the belief that the greater the poverty of a district, the more prone the latter is towards leprosy. Considering India as an unit the masses are poor and live in defective hygienic conditions, far below the level of the western European nations, and appa- rently have lived in such surroundings for centuries. An absolute comparison between the individual provinces and dis- tricts is impossible, but the Commissioners express their strong belief that it can be shown that the numerical diffusion of leprosy depends, among other factors, greatly on the well- being of the population, and that with the furtherance of pro- sperity, education, and hygiene, and in fact with a substitution of a standard of maintenance for that of subsistence, leprosy will materially decrease in India as it has done in Europe. Such progress has been going on actively in India for the last twenty years, and it is hoped that under the British Govern- ment the native standard of health and wealth will more and more approach that of the masses in the mother country. Leprosy an Endemic Disease. In a subsequent chapter it will be more fully explained that in leprosy, as in tuberculosis, a special individual disposition is necessary for the acquisition of the disease. Here an attempt has been made to show that it is by no means improbable that the general susceptibility to leprosy of a district and its inhabi- tants depends on certain conditions: in other words, there seem to be certain factors, partly connected with the climatic, economic, social, or hygienic conditions which establish the
?Distribution of Leprosy. 99 endemic nature of this affection. A disease can only be en- demic in an area where all the conditions leading to its acqui- sition exist. Leprosy is an infectious disease, but besides the contagium vivum a certain disposition of the individual is ne- cessary to produce the disease in the latter. Therefore it can only be endemic in areas where besides the virus, those factors also exist which are held responsible for the special disposition in the individual. This virus will probably be found in the resting stage of the bacillus lepr, but as yet the living microbe has not been found outside the human body. Assuming that, since the disease is highly prevalent, this virus is widely distributed throughout space, and that special conditions of an area largely predispose its population, it is evident that every facility is offered for an acquisition of the disease de novo, that is, an acquisition of leprosy apart from contagion. Indeed if the virus is widely distributed, contagion may be practically neglected, since all measures directed against the latter could be of no avail in stamping out the disease. Tetanus, to give an example, is no doubt a contagious affection, the specific parasite, however, in some form or other is so widely distributed, that the risks of acquiring this disease through contact, direct or indirect, practically vanish when compared with the chances of an independent infection from the soil or dust, an individual thus acquiring the disease de novo. It is not intended to imply by the term de novo that the parasite is of no tiological importance, but that the microbe may reach the body and set up the disease quite apart from contagion if only the required disposition exists. At the pre- sent time it is an only too common practice to consider any disease, dependent on a specific organism, contagious under all conditions alike and without allowing degrees of conta- giousness. The conditions under which a disease becomes contagious are often regarded as unimportant, and it is these which actually lead to the establishment of a predisposition. H 2
?100 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Modern bacteriological research has disclosed many facts which clearly indicate that contagiousness is an extremely relative term. This will be more fully considered subsequently, and here only a few points will be mentioned in proof of how easily general causes, such as poverty, famine, and precarious living may lead to a special disposition towards a disease-may, in fact, cause such disease to be endemic over a certain area. It has been shown that dogs of one colour are more susceptible to anthrax than those of another; pigeons and hens, normally resistant against the same disease, are easily infected, if allow- ed to starve. Again rabbits, naturally more or less refractory to quarter evil, lose their immunity through fatigue and over- exertion; and Hankin has shown that a meat diet increases the resistance of ordinary rats against anthrax, while a milk diet causes them to be susceptible to this disease. These few facts-and instances might easily be multiplied-show how readily a disease, originally non-contagious for a certain class of animals, may be rendered contagious. The virus has re- mained unchanged all the time, but an alteration in the organism of the individual has taken place.  An endemic area, then, would be one where (a) the virus in some form or other is present, and where also (b) such conditions exist as are calculated to exercise a special pre- disposing influence on the population, thus enabling the para- site not only to enter the body but also to grow and thrive in the same. It has been seen that there are districts in India where leprosy is exceedingly prevalent, and has been so at all three enumerations. These districts agree chiefly in the follow- ing points, viz., the existence of poverty, insanitary conditions, over-population, unhealthy or moist climate. Whether the virus is also abundant in these districts cannot be proven, so long as bacteriology is almost ignorant regarding the life history of the leprosy bacillus. As the disease has existed in India since antiquity, it is highly probable that the bacilli in a resting stage are widely distributed, ready to encounter the susceptible
?Distribution of Leprosy. 101 individual, and with the experience gained from the tiology of tuberculosis, it is quite legitimate to assume so. It may be objected that the assumption of a dormant condition of the bacillus lepr outside the human body is a mere hypothesis. This hypothesis, however, explains all the facts in the diffusion of leprosy, and is, in reality, also accepted by those who believe in the spread of the disease by means of contagion, when they attribute the acquisition of leprosy to such acts as the washing and wearing of lepers' clothes, and so forth. Again, there are similar cases in bacteriology, e.g., tetanus, where the specific organisms no doubt exist in the soil or dust, in the form of spores, and yet have never been demonstrated microscopically. At the present time no one denies the necessity of a special predisposition in the case of tuberculosis. "It is esta- blished beyond doubt that for the development of the latter disease there must exist a certain ensemble of unhygienic and bad or poor conditions of life, often perhaps transmitted from the parents and ancestors. Thus the importance of general, social, as well as hygienic, conditions is, eo ipso, acknow- ledged."30 Leprosy is not more frequent in some parts, as Bankoora and Assam, because the people are more careless here in their intercourse with lepers, but because the conditions here are more favourable to the origin and spread of the disease, just as the greater prevalence of tuberculosis among the in- dustrial classes, as compared with the agricultural population in England, is not accounted for by the assumption that the former expose themselves more recklessly to the risks of con- tagion. How much heredity and contagion contribute to the spread of leprosy will be discussed in Chapters IV and V. The consideration of the fact that even in those districts where leprosy is extremely prevalent but little changes in the affected population have taken place during the last thirty (30) Dina Sandberg. * Eitschrift fur Hygiene IX, page 376.
?102 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: years points rather to the existence of general conditions lead- ing to a specific disposition. For there is no evidence to justify the assumption that the native is more careful in his intercourse with lepers now than he was a generation ago. Yet the disease remains stationary: indeed probably is slightly on the decrease. It is asked, "What is this due to?" A comparison with what has happened in England in the case of tuberculosis will most readily appeal to those less familiar with leprosy. According to English statistics31 there has been since 1858 a steady decrease in the mortality from phthisis both in the agricultural and industrial population, and this decrease has taken place much more rapidly than the decrease of mortality from all causes during the same period. Again the decrease of mortality from phthisis in the industrial population has been proportionately greater than that in the agricultural classes. From these facts this follows, that the decrease in the general mortality establishes that a gradual improvement in the vital condition in England has taken place, and that this improve- ment accounts for the still greater decrease in the phthisis mortality. As Dr. Sandberg32 writes: "The steady decrease of the phthisis mortality in England argues strongly for a general development of sound hygienic principles throughout the various classes of the population and for the benefit arising from sound hygienic measures." In England, then, the conditions leading to a general or individual disposition have been, and are, constantly counter- acted, with the result that phthisis is on the decline. Now if the decrease in the leper population according to census sta- tistics is an actual one, does it not seem more reasonable to assume that this is due to the improvement in social and hygienic conditions which undoubtedly has taken place during (31) W. Farr: Vital Statistics, 1885, pages 267, 268. Fr. Oesterlen: Handbucn der med. Statistik, pages 405, 406. 32 Loc. cit.
?Distribution of Leprosy. 103 the last quarter of a century? If such decrease, however, be not accepted, may it not be expected that by means of such improvement the leper population, instead of remaining station- ary, will gradually diminish? It must be the chief aim of the reformer to counteract the agents which are responsible for the fact that leprosy is endemic in India. It is impossible to attack the virus itself, but it seems not only possible to battle against the predisposing causes, but to do so with fair hope of eventual success. There is in India a tendency towards a decrease of the disease, and this is assuredly due to the rapid progress of the social, economic, and hygienic conditions all over the empire. With a further and continued improvement of these, it may be hoped that in India leprosy will cease to be an endemic disease. Density of Population in Relation to the Diffusion of Leprosy. The health and wealth of a population is closely con- nected with the density of the population, and for any other country it might fairly be assumed that the masses would always crowd to the richest areas. However, when it is remembered that the Indian ideas of the standard of life and comfort are very low, and that the people aim simply at subsistence in contradistinction to maintenance, it is neces- sary to exercise great care in forming an opinion as to the wealth and well-being of the population. The fixity of occu- pation and of condition, the great rigidity of domestic relations, necessitate a keen indisposition in man to disperse, and thus in some parts of the country there is no organised emigration as yet, while in other parts the people have gradually accustomed themselves to abandon their homes. A local congestion is thus easily established, all the more as the requirements of the masses are so moderate and the desire to increase them so weak. Now as a population tends to increase faster within a fixed area than the land yields food for it, and as according to
?104 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: the principle of diminished return from land after the soil has been worked to a certain extent, the application to it of addi- tional labour or capital ceases to bring in the same proportion- ate return as it did at first, and this decrease in productiveness is continuous, it is clear that the density of population is no index of the wealth of a district, and that the comparative wealth of the various areas must be estimated in a different manner.33 Yet it seems proper to enquire into the relation between the leper diffusion and the density of population. The append- ed table shows clearly that no law exists between the two, whether famine districts be excluded or not. Bengal, Bombay, Madras, and the Punjab have been chosen, and these four provinces may suffice. Examples demonstrating the truth of the above statement might easily be multiplied. TABLE XVIII.

Thus, for Belgium, according to an enumeration made in 1879, it was four hundred and eighty-six per square mile, for England and Wales in 1881 as much as four hundred and forty-five, while for Norway and Sweden it was as small as fourteen and twenty-six, respectively, for the censuses of 1877 and 1878. if a proof be required to show the truth of the statement that a relation between wealth and density of popu- lation is not a matter of necessity, this will best be found in Sind. Being near the frontier, with a good sea-port, it has for a long time been the resort of traders from the north and west. In the interior are one or two large trade centres rapidly increasing under the in- fluence of established lines of railway. Prosperity has grown under good harvests and improved means of transport to market. Al- together Sind must be considered as being greatly above the aver- age as regards its wealth, and yet it is but scantily populated.34 Predisposition of Races. "The people of India proper, by which term is meant the whole of the Western Peninsula and the plains west of the Brahmaputra consist of a number of races and tribes of most diverse origin, and owing to the restrictions of caste which rigorously prohibit intermarriage, they have not amalgamated to form a nation or even a number of nations as, for instance, Celts, Saxons, Danes, and Normans have done to form the English and Scotch of to-day. Religious and sectarian differ- ences have added to the original differences of race, so that at the present day as well as throughout her whole past history, while India has always been a collection of many countries, no one of these constitutes or has ever constituted a nation in the European sense of the term."35 "The population of India pro- per consists of the dark aboriginal races, descended from the original occupants of the country at the time of the first Aryan invasion;  (2) the fair or at least lighter-tinted descendants of (34) J. A. Baines. Op. cit., Chapter II. (35) H. E. Blandford. Op. cit., page 36.

It does not spare the European of unmixed blood, and the Commissioners during their personal enquiries met with five cases representing three nationalities, German, French, and English. Eurasians suffering from leprosy are frequently found. These facts, however, are so well-known that it is hardly necessary to delay any further over them. It may be interesting to mention that since 1860 from the European army (Bengal, 1860-69, and India, 1870-89), two soldiers have been invalided on account of leprosy, one from the Bombay Army in 1879, and the other from the Madras Army in 1887; and two have been admitted for the same cause. For the following details the Commissioners are indebted to the Statistical Medical Officer with the Government of India:- EUROPEAN ARMY. (Bengal,  1860-69 and India, 1870-89).

112      REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: On the other hand, the admissions on account of leprosy from the Native Army during the period of ten years, from 1879-1888 amounted to two hundred and twenty-nine, as will be seen from the subjoined table:- NATIVE ARMY. Admissions for Leprosy. YEAR. No. admitted. REMARKS. 1879 34  1880  35 1 death. 1881 25  1882 25  1883  20   1884 18  1885 8  1886 19 2 deaths. 1887 20  1888  25  TOTAL 229 3 deaths. It is impossible from a comparison of the two armies to deduce a racial predisposition, as the conditions under which the British soldier lives are entirely different from those of the native. The former is exceedingly well looked after and cared for, and resides for a limited number of years only in the coun- try, while the native passes perhaps a lifetime in an endemic

In contrasting statistics, great caution must be exercised as to equality of the concomitant variations, a diffi- culty which has confronted the Commissioners over the length and breadth of this chapter. There are in India no favoured races which are exempt from the disease, and it can only be want of experience which prompted one observer to remark: "I have never seen or heard of a case of leprosy in a pure European."38 And it seems assuming too much that the fact of an Eurasian suffer- ing should be explained as an inheritance through the native stock.39 It is difficult to estimate to what extent the various races suffer. Arguing from general impressions, as accurate statis- tics are not obtainable, it would appear that the native element is undoubtedly more prone to the disease, and the unmixed European least; but accurate figures cannot be given. The difference, however, may well depend on the inequality of social rather than racial conditions, the native ranking lowest in such a scale, while the Eurasian occupies an intermediate level. The Commissioners are therefore of opinion that, per se, no one race is more liable to contract leprosy, and that given equal and favourable conditions, all will be affected alike. These few words must suffice on this subject. Leprosy in Relation to Religion and Caste. I. -Examined by religion the Kabirpanthis show the highest proportion for 1881. The Buddhists show very high leper ratios throughout, the Aboriginals, on the other hand, low ones. The proportion for each religion is best stated in tabular form.

There can be no doubt that in such an estimation errors have occurred when the difficulty of defi- nition and elasticity of the designation 'Hindu' is considered, but the main inaccuracy resulting from mistakes will probably be found in an under-estimate of the Aboriginals and Jains, many of the latter being returned as Hindus." 40 For such general matters as are discussed in this chapter such deficiencies are of little importance.

Distribution of Leprosy.         115   dhists are found chiefly in Burma, nine-tenths of this popu- lation being followers of Gautama, while there are not two hundred thousand to be found over the length and breadth of the continent of India. The Nats are entirely restricted to Burma. The Jains exist in numbers in the presidency of Bombay and in Rajputana only, the North-Western Provinces coming next in order. Their scruples respecting the destruc- tion of animal life or touching animal food are well known, and this is important with regard to a theory of the origin of leprosy which is based on the consumption of fish. The Jain community is greatly commercial in character, and as a rule in easy circumstances, and in some districts, at Gujarat and Ahmedabad, with considerable or predominant influence.41 This may to a great extent account for the small amount of leprosy found amongst them.     "The Satnamis, who include a large number of agricul-  tural Chamars within their body, are found almost exclusively  in Raipur and Bilaspur. The true Satnamis abstain from  tobacco, intoxicating liquors and drugs, animal food, and from  certain vegetables. They are of taller physique, fairer and  better made than the other inhabitants of the country. Their  food consists of the produce of the fields, of which they always  have plenty, the virgin soil yielding a copious outturn for com-  paratively little labour. Their abstinence from animal food  (which in a country so hot as Chhattisgarh works more harm  than good), and from all sorts of intoxicating drinks and drugs,  and their agricultural pursuits give them health. Their ideas  of cleanliness are capable of much improvement ; they sleep in  a hovel without windows, with an array of children of all ages  around them, squatting on the floor, on which the veriest  apology for a coarse mattress is sometimes spread."42     The Kabirpanthis, amongst whom  relatively the largest  number of lepers is found, are also chiefly recorded in the           (41) Imperial Census Report for  1881, page 42.

In their social relations, habits, and superstition they differ but slightly from the Satnamis.43 The Sikhs, who have less lepers in their ranks than any other religious body, are found mainly in the Punjab, the only instance in which they appear in any strength outside the Punjab being in the adjacent province of Sind. But they are met with scattered about in small groups all over Hin- dustan and in some parts of the Deccan. Although composed of different ethnic elements they form a race with as marked features as any other in the Peninsula.44 They have preserved their ancient talent for war, and they supply a contingent of picked men to the Anglo-Indian army. They are altogether perhaps the manliest and finest set of men in the empire. Tobacco smoking is strictly prohibited, but they do not abstain from spirituous liquors and animal food, the flesh of the cow only being a forbidden dish. These few remarks may suffice. The Sikhs and Jains are undoubtedly most exempt from leprosy, and the Parsis approach them closely in this respect. These three bodies are more or less select, the Sikhs representing the physically finest class of men, while the Jains and Parsis stand commercially highest, and belong to the wealthier portion of the community. The healthy life of the Satnamis has been alluded to. Excluding the Aboriginals, leprosy is least found in these four sections, and this may perhaps be explained by their social or physical superiority. That, however, an abstinence from animal food by no means prevents a diffusion of leprosy is well illustrated by the Kabirpanthis. Among the Buddhists and Nats much leprosy is found, but it is well known that the social and personal conditions of the Burmans are low, and in many parts (13) Imperial Census Report for 1881, pages 45 to 48. (44) Barth: The Religions of India.
Distribution of Leprosy.          117  deplorable. Table XIX thus seems to imply that where the religious belief is coupled with bad social conditions the leper ratios are highest, while, when favoured by exceptional surround- ings, the proportion decreases considerably. Intermediate are the Hindus, Christians, and Muhammadans, and these may be said to represent the average population of India as regards personal and hygienic conditions.     II.-At the recent enumeration the lepers were arranged according to caste, since a classification based on the various forms of religious belief becomes more and more uncertain, as time and enlightenment advance, and is thus open to critiism. Drs. Lewis and Cunningham, as far as opportunities were offered, enquired into the relation of caste to leprosy. Their investigation, however, was confined to Kumaun only. They write in their report as follows: " As the inhabitants of Kunmaun virtually consist of two classes only--Rajputs and Domtes, the former representing an Aryan population, the latter the Aboriginal people, whilst other classes are only very sparingly represented--the evidence, such as it is, is in favour of impartial distribution of the disease."      The Commissioners can assert with confidence, from  personal experience and enquiry, that no caste is exempt.  It remains only to examine to what degree the various classes  are affected, and whether one or other body is relatively more  liable to suffer from leprosy.     Unfortunately it was impossible to obtain statements of  the lepers arranged according to castes from the various  provinces or presidencies. Accurate details could be obtained  from the Punjab only, and the following remarks therefore  apply exclusively to this province. As far as general impres-  sions go, however, the conclusion derived from the statistical  evidence of the Punjab leper population may be taken to  represent the state of affairs in India generally.      ln the following table the lepers have been arranged ac-  cording to castes, the latter being again subdivided as to their
118 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: material prosperity into three classes, viz., rich, moderately prosperous and poor. A classification of this nature no doubt involves great difficulties and cannot be altogether without inaccuracies. It has, however, been prepared as carefully as possible after due consultation with British officials and educated natives most versed in this matter. No European, and perhaps even no Indian, possesses a perfect knowledge of the caste systems, and hence the following remarks must be accepted as suggestions merely. From the following statistics it appears that the least amount of leprosy is found among the wealthy or rich castes, the ratio being less than one per ten thousand, while the disease is most prevalent among the poorer castes (3.05 per ten thousand) This suggests the fact that leprosy like tuberculosis has a certain predilection for people living under bad and more or less miserable conditions. It is greatly to be regretted that on account of the unavoidable want of statistical data at the time of writing, statements regarding other parts of India were unobtainable, because the evidence afforded by one province can hardly be considered sufficient, when a question of so difficult a nature is under discussion. In future, however, the degree to which the richer and poorer castes respectively are liable to suffer from leprosy should demand attention. It has already been shown that the poverty-stricken districts present higher ratios than the wealthier ones, and if the distribution of leprosy among the different castes should also establish this connexion between the disease and bad social or hygienic conditions, the importance of an individual predisposition is placed beyond a doubt. The further investigation of this matter must, however, be left to others who are more familiar with Indian social matters and who are in possession of all the statistical evidence obtainable The few facts at the disposal of the Commission clearly point to the influence of poverty and its accompaniments or consequences on the distribution of leprosy.

?124      REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Asylums and the Distribution of Leprosy. I.- There being no segregation in India, it may be asked whether on the hypothesis of contagion the practice of collect- ing lepers at one centre might not become a source of danger to the community. In all the Asylums of the Punjab the lepers are allowed, on special days at least, to go out into the bazaars and the neighbourhood to procure food or whatever they require, thus mixing freely among the people. If by this means the disease were liable to be spread amongst the population, an increase should be noticeable in the leper ratios of each district from one census to another, all the more as the number of inmates is steadily increasing from year to year. Such increase, however, cannot be traced, as the following table will show:- TABLE XXI. Asylums and the Spread of Leprosy.       ASYLUM AND DISTRICT. Ratio per 10,000 (st Census). Ratio per 10,000 (2nd Census). Ratio per 10,000 (3rd Census). REMARKS. Amritsar    63 44 15 The ratios are cal-  culated on   10,000  of the population.

The three censuses point clearly to a decrease of leprosy in the respective districts,
Distribution of Leprosy. 125 and this can in no way be due to segregation, as such is by no means enforced in any of the Institutions mentioned in the table. The same applies to all other Asylums, but it is not necessary to devote more time or space to this matter. II.-Again the increase in the number of inmates of an Asylum has been used as an argument that leprosy is rapidly spreading in India. Alarmists especially make use of the returns of Asylums and dispensaries to prove an increase of the disease. Such arguments are illogical and incapable of show- ing what they are intended to do. Dispensaries and hospitals alike were unpopular in India but a short time ago, and the Asylum to the leper especially distasteful. By gradual and slow education they came to understand the blessing of such philanthropic Institutions and learned to seek an abode in them. All therefore that can be deduced from such figures is an increased popularity of such homes. But it is not legitimate to draw deductions from hospital returns as to the increase or decrease of leprosy. In all such matters the education of the people is of great importance. It might, to take a more familiar example, be thought that adenoid vegetations of the nasopharynx were becoming commoner in England, because patients recognise the advantages of treatment more fully now and appear oftener at the hospitals to be operated on, while formerly they simply neglected their condition. These growths have always been common in England, but the affected did not seek relief. So it is with leprosy, and it may be hoped that the people in India will be still further educated to recog- nise the advantages of Asylums and palliative treatment. It is well known to all Civil Surgeons that the native has an abhorrence of a ward and does not seek admission into a hospital for chronic diseases, though he has great faith in practical surgery, and its more obvious and striking successes. This form of argument from dispensary and asylum returns is, however, reduced to an absurdity when the Matoonga Asylum at Bombay is quoted to establish the increase of the leprous
126 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: population in India.45 For into this Asylum all the lepers of Bombay and its neighbourhood, as far as room could be provided for them, were crowded and retained under a Muni- cipal Act, and admission at the inauguration of the Institution, at least, could by no means be considered voluntary. Nor was there an option given to the inmates to leave the Asylum at will. In fact, the whole management of lepers in Bombay being placed under the Municipal authorities, a police guard was stationed at the entrance of the Asylum at the time of the visit by the Commission. That the procedure was for the good of the lepers who lived in clean and comfortable quarters, tended by a skilled physician, there can be no doubt, but to say " that many applicants were refused admission and that this is a proof of the great number of lepers, or of the increase of the pest in India," challenges open criticism. III.-The presence of an Asylum in a district often attracts numbers of lepers from neighbouring regions, and this is a point which must not be left out of sight when an enquiry is made into the leper density of a district. This applies especially to such localities as border on native or feudatory States, for in such cases immigration is not at all uncommon. The lepers finding more congenial conditions under the British rule leave their own State. Moreover, it has been pointed out in the Census. Reports, that such migration of people of all classes from native into British territory is by no means un- common-a silent testimony to the excellence of the European government. In Kumaun the percentage of lepers is very high, and it was found by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham46 that the portions of the district which are specially affected, are near the Nepal frontier, and there is no doubt that many of the unfortunate people cross the border to find more favourable surroundings. (45) Leprosy and Vaccination, by W. \ill\. (46) Op. cit.
Distribution of Leprosy. 127 That they should gravitate around Almora with its excellent Asylum is not surprising. Again the leper ratios for the Simla district are very high. Simla lies embedded amongst feuda- tory States, and has an old established Asylum at Subathu. The total number of lepers registered in the Census Reports for this district is only a little above the actual number of inmates at the Subathu Asylum. From information, kindly supplied by Dr. Carleton, it was gathered that a large number of the patients admitted come from Garhwal, but the largest number migrate from Kangra, and many seek admission from the native States. It is evident, therefore, that the ratios for Simla given in the three censuses (34.7, 28.6, and 28.8, re- spectively) by no means represent the actual amount of leprosy for the district. It was found that of forty-seven patients at the Rawalpindi Asylum fifteen belonged to Kashmir or Punch and two to Afghanistan, while at Sialkot, of forty lepers, thirteen had obtained admission from distant districts, and of these, four from Jummoo and Patiala. "At the Dehra Dun Asylum," Dr. G. B. Ruttledge writes " of one hundred inmates only twelve belonged to the district itself, eighty-two having sought admission from native States, and six from neighbouring districts." The same is true of other frontier Asylums, and there can be no doubt that a constant flow from outlying dis- tricts, and especially from native States, takes place. These points are especially worthy of consideration with regard to the hill tracts. Though undoubtedly leprosy prevails greatly in these regions, the ratios in many instances are increased by immigration. Whenever, therefore, a district shows a dense leper population, one of the points of enquiry must be, whether an Asylum exists in the locality, and how many of the inmates of such Asylum have immigrated from outlying regions. Leprosy and Vaccination. It has been maintained that " the synchronicity between the spread of leprosy and the extension of vaccination has
128 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: given rise, in some districts, to such a dread of vaccination that every device is resorted to by thoughtful parents to prevent their children from being vaccinated." 47. The history of lep- rosy of India by no means bears out the assertion that such "spread or recrudescence of the disease has taken place during the last thirty years." It will be shown in the follow- ing lines that, apart from the fact that the above dictum re- garding "the connexion between the extension of the State- provided remedy against small-pox and leprosy" involves a serious petitio principii, a dread of infection through vaccina- tion does by no means exist in India, and no uneasy feeling is exhibited on this account and also that there is no reason to fear a spread of this pest by such means. It is true that in certain localities hostility to the opera- tion is met with, but this is due chiefly to the inherent suspi- cion of an uneducated and ignorant people of any proceeding of which the reason is not understood, and also among Hindus to quasi-religious motives. Were this hostility to the operation based upon observance of its confirmed results in spreading leprosy or other diseases, the opposition should have come at some time subsequent to the introduction of the prac- tice. As a matter of fact, however, it is only at first that this is observed, and as time wears on, vaccination becomes more and more readily accepted by the people. In not a single instance did a leper accuse vaccination as the cause of his misfortune, although the Commissioners enquired in every case into the theory a patient might offer for the development of his disease. As enlightenment and education advance, the native becomes more and more awake to the benefit conferred on him and his children by vaccination. Such statements as those quoted above can only delay the progress of the work inaugurated by a philanthropic prince by calling up groundless fears and anxieties in the mind of an uneducated people. (47) W. Tebb, Leprosy and Vaccination, page 13.
Distribution of Leprosy. 129 This whole question deserves fuller consideration. Since vaccination is said to diffuse leprosy in India, the first point to be enquired into is the method employed. Anti-vaccinationists are accustomed to speak of the danger of spreading the disease by means of vaccination, as though the method of protective inoculation were uniform, and as though vaccination were ex- clusively practised from arm to arm with human lymph, or from arm to arm. If leprosy be transmissible in this manner, it can only be by vaccination with human lymph or through the use of un- clean instruments. Now in the city of Bombay calf lymph is exclusively used, at the present time at least. In Madras the Government has also determined to introduce as rapidly as possible a complete system of vaccination involving the use of animal vaccine to the entire exclusion of human lymph, and similar steps are taken in other parts, as in Bengal, Assam, and Burma. There is also no doubt that calf lymph is at pre- sent extensively used all over India. Hence in calculating the chances of spreading purely human diseases by means of vaccination allowance must be made for the fact that a consi- derable number of persons by being vaccinated do not expose themselves to any such risk, for the danger of an infection by means of unclean instruments is infinitesimally small, and can therefore be disregarded. Such an event presupposes that the person undergoing the process of vaccination is a leper, and this in the case of infants and children, to begin with, must be an extremely rare occurrence, and hardly more frequent in the case of adults. Again, it is more than probable that in the event of a confirmed leper offering himself for vaccination, the most neglectful operator would be roused to the most careful performance of his duty. Finally the person vaccinated from, or after, a leper must be in the proper state or predisposition to be infected by leprosy. The simultaneous occurrence of all these concomitant conditions is hardly conceivable. It is impossible to state in figures to what extent animal K
130 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: vaccine is employed, but careful enquiry has shown that the use of calf lymph is very considerable, and is steadily increas- ing in the different provinces of India. As, however, bovine lymph has been in use only during the last ten years, to give those who raised the cry the best of the argument, this fact will be neglected in the following lines, and it will be assumed that the operation is practised with human lymph only and from arm to arm. Again, it must not be forgotten that as yet vaccination is by no means generally introduced into India. What percent- age of the population has been vaccinated, it is difficult to say, but on enquiry from the most trustworthy sources, it is found to be the general belief that less than ten per cent. of the whole population are so protected. The Commissioners have, in a great number of cases, questioned the lepers on this point, but the result obtained by them cannot be taken as trustworthy evidence, because they had to rely on the answers of uneducated people to ques- tions often asked through an interpreter. An examination of the vaccination marks frequently conveyed no information, for the cutaneous leprous lesions often so completely change or obliterate the scar, that it is impossible to say whether the patient has been vaccinated or not. The native's idea of vac- cination is very indefinite, for he understands by the term "tika" any process leaving a scar on his body, and such oper- ations are widely practised by the hakims and baids. The only admissible evidence, therefore, is to be found in the sta- tistical returns of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Govern- ment of India. Here again it must be remembered that the returns of native vaccinators are not absolutely trustworthy, for being obliged to submit a definite monthly return, they are very apt to increase this by recording fictitious cases. This is mentioned to show that the figures obtainable from the Sanitary Commissioner's Report err rather on the side of overestimating the number of people vaccinated, that
Distribution of Leprosy. 131 is, the number of people who according to some anti-vaccina- tionists have run the risk of acquiring such diseases as syphilis or leprosy. It appears that during the year 1889-90 of 199,638,558 individuals only 2.9 per cent. were vaccinated, and this ratio has never been exceeded since the institution of vaccination. Were the operation generally practised, this ratio should be much higher, considering that vaccination is still in its infancy in India. Of the six millions vaccinated in India during 1889-1890 about five millions were infants. The number of vaccinations annually performed has gradually increased from two millions in 1871-1872 to six millions in 1889-1890, and the ratio ob- tained for the latter period is the highest yet reached. Ever since the official introduction of vaccination into India, chil- dren under six years of age have supplied the greatest number to the vaccinators. Now the death-rate of infants is extremely high and has always been so. Considering, therefore, that since the institution of vaccination never more than three per cent. of the total population have been operated upon during any one year, that of this number more than 75 per cent. are always infants, and that the mortality among the latter is very high, it is by no means improbable that at the present time less than ten per cent. of the total population in India are actually vaccinated. The following statement will also show to what a small extent vaccination is as yet practised in India. "In England and Wales of 886,198 births returned to the Board by the several vaccination officers, as registered during the year 1887, the number which at the time the return was made had been registered as successfully vaccinated was 733,986, or 828 per cent. of the whole, and if revaccinations are included, this percentage rises to 919 "48 In India, on the other (48) Nineteenth Annual Report of the Local Government Board.

Now leprosy is found in about one out of two thousand individuals of all ages, and it is certainly not found as often as in one out of one hundred thousand cases at an infantile period. (d) Lastly, the error of using lymph from a leprous child, especially as the disease is easily recog- nised, must occur extremely seldom. The chances, therefore, of leprosy being spread in this manner must be very small indeed, if at all conceivable. Vac- cination is becoming more popular every year, and yet leprosy has not increased, but rather decreased since the last enumera- tion: that "recrudescence," assumed by many, has not taken place, so far as the census figures show. The latter, however, have always been employed as evidence by those who con- demned vaccination or clamoured for compulsory segregation. Lastly, reference must be made to some important evidence which has lately become public. Surgeon-Major Pringle, in a paper on "Vaccination and Leprosy" read before the late Congress of Hygiene and Demography, stated that for a period of twenty years from 1864 to 1884, when Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in the North-Western Provinces, he had spent five months each year in camp in the hill districts of Kumaun and British Garhwal. He estimated that during these twenty years he had vaccinated about two million persons, but he had never seen a case of leprosy traceable to vaccination, and had never heard of its happening, though natives of those districts were ready with objections and reasons for not having their children vaccinated. Dr. Pringle also stated that during his tenure of office he was in the habit at the end of the hot weather of bringing
134 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: vaccine lymph down from British Garhwal, a markedly leprous district, and using it for vaccinating in that part of the plains included between the rivers Ganges and Jumna. Now, the first census returns (1867-72) show that, whereas the proportion of lepers in British Garhwal was 240 per ten thousand, that in the plains between the rivers was only 225 to 25 per ten thousand. Here, then, is an approximation to a scientific experiment. Children in a district where leprosy is comparatively rare are vaccinated with lymph from a district where leprosy is many times more common. If vaccination were responsible for spreading leprosy, an increase of the disease in this particular part of India might justly be expected. As a matter of fact, however, on comparing the census returns for the districts in question, the following will be found to be the facts:- British Garhwal.     District between the Ganges          and Jumna. 1867-72    .  240 per 10,000  225 to 25 per 10,000 1881        .    181  per 10,000  2 25 to 25 per 10,000 1891        .  169 per 10,000  15 to 20 per 10,000 Thus not only has leprosy fallen in British Garhwal from 24.0 to 16.9 per ten thousand, but in the district vaccinated with lymph from British Garhwal the proportion of lepers has remained stationary, if not decreased. As Dr. Pringle was on duty, as stated above, from 1864 to 1884, and the number vaccinated with his lymph was gradually accumulating all these years, even allowing for removal by death and other counteracting influences, such as the diminution of leprosy in British Garhwal, it should be expected that by 1881 and 1891 the figures would show some evidence of the increase of leprosy which is alleged to follow the use of lymph collected in leprous districts. This increase, however, does not appear in the census returns. In conclusion, those who accuse vaccination of spreading leprosy must first ensure the correctness of their major premise
Distribution of Leprosy. 135 that leprosy has increased. It may be said that they argued exclusively from the first two censuses. But even then it will be seen that these establish a decrease of leprosy in Burma, Bombay, the Punjab, and Oudh. Again, the conditions under which vaccination is practised in India should be carefully studied as to how far animal and how far human lymph is employed, and whether leprosy has increased in those provin- ces or districts in which the human lymph is used. Lastly, they must bring the positive proof that leprosy is capable of being transmitted by such a form of inoculation as is implied in vaccination. The onus probandi necessarily rests with those who make the accusation, and until a series of positive cases, free from all doubt and objection, can be demonstrated, the statement that leprosy is diffused by vaccination must be regarded as devoid of scientific value. Concluding Remarks. It has been maintained by many writers that leprosy in British India is on the increase. Medical and lay papers agree on this point. Thus the British Medical Journal49 asserts that the number of lepers has been increasing at the rate of thirty thousand every ten years, and that during the last decennium the rate of increase is supposed to have been even higher. That this is not so has been already shown. The number of lepers has been estimated at two hundred and fifty thousand.50 The only means of testing this is a comparison of the census returns. Now, according to the first census for British India, the number amounted to about a hundred thousand, and for 1881 it was one hundred and twenty thousand, while for 1891 it is about one hundred and ten thousand. As shown in the general remarks, from five to ten per cent. may justly be subtracted, so that from a hundred (49) British Medical Journal, September 13th, 1890. (50) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 1.
136 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: thousand to one hundred and five thousand would fairly accu- rately represent the leper population for British India. From the consideration of the leper distribution according to the three censuses, it is evident that the alarm about the increase of leprosy in British India is altogether groundless; in fact, that the figures available, unfortunately consisting only of three sets, point strongly to a decrease among these unfortunate people, in any case to the disease being at a standstill. Again, the number of lepers has been greatly overstated, a hundred and ten thousand being perhaps nearest the truth. Leprosy cannot, therefore, be regarded in the light of an "Imperial Danger." In the following appendix full information regarding the leper population will be found. As at the time of writing the returns for 1891 had not been fully revised, a few inaccuracies may perhaps have found their way into the third part of the appendix; they will, however, be slight and hardly affect the ratios. The Commissioners take this opportunity of recording their appreciation of the assistance afforded by their clerk, Lala Atar Chand, in the preparation of these statistical tables.
Distribution of Lepers, etc., 1867-72. 137 APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III. Distribution of Lepers in the various Provinces of India according to the three Census Returns. IN a few instances the figures in this Appendix disagree with the returns of the Imperial Census Reports. As, however, the latter often include in their totals areas where no leper census was taken, and such areas have been carefully omitted here, and again as the official returns were otherwise checked, such discrepancies are only apparent. In the Assam census of 1881, for instance, no special attention was paid to infirmities in the Naga and Garo Hill districts, and the se were consequently left out. Again, in Bengal, no informa- tion regarding the Chittagong Hill Tracts was available. These examples may suffice. It is, of course, quite possible, and even probable, while dealing with so great a mass of figures and ratios, that a few errors and omissions have escaped detection, out these will be so slight as not to affect the arguments in the text.

Allahabad  856,324 76 .8 Leprosy is far more concentrated in the Deccan and Konkan than other infirmities, and is pro- bably returned in greater number than it should be owing to the inclusion of cases of the false or discolourative disease. In Ratnagiri there is a hospital for this infirm- ity which may be attend- ed by patients from other parts of the country, and thus raises the local rate. In Sind this disease is scarcely to be found, and it is not unlikely that special care was taken by the enumerators here to exclude cases of the white disease. The operations, too, were under the Local Sanitary Com- missioner, who would be likely to keep an extra sharp watch on a matter so interesting to his own departmental study."

?204               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: CHAPTER IV. Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. THERE is as little consensus of opinion as to the heredi- tary transmission of leprosy from parent to offspring as there is with regard to the contagiousness of the disease. It is not necessary to enumerate the views of the various authors, and only a few references need be made. Dr. Liveing1 inclines to the belief in an hereditary predisposition rather than an actual transmission of the disease, while Danielssen and Boeck maintain that hereditary predisposition and trans- mission are the chief causes of the perpetuation of the disease in Norway.2 It should be remarked that the latter authors speak really of an actual hereditary transmission, and not of a mere predisposition. Leloir3 and Hansen,4 on the other hand, altogether deny the existence of such transmission or predis- position. Hansen, as is well known, visited North America to enquire into the condition of the Norwegian lepers who had emigrated to that country. Out of 160 original emigrants he found only seventeen alive, and not one of the descendants of these 160 men had contracted leprosy. This fact is most important. Turning now to Virchow5 it is found that he says: "The existence of an hereditary tendency has been admitted in all ages and in all countries." But he asserts distinctly that only the predisposition, and not the disease itself, is tran- smitted: "without special and specific external relations and causes, the disease will not appear in the offspring of leprous (1) R. Liveing: Goulstonian Lectures for 1873 (Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1873), pages 84-87. (2)  Danielssen and Boeck: Trait de la Spedalskhed. (Paris, 1848): also R. Liveing loc, cit., page 84.

?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.              205 parents." He continues: "If it be true that amongst the lepers who emigrated from Norway to America the disease has disappeared, then we must ascribe a very great importance indeed to these external causes." The proof of this has now been given by Hansen. As regards leprosy in India, Dr. Vandyke Carter,6 in his well-known work, strongly urges the spread of the disease through hereditary transmission; and Drs. Lewis and Cunningham,7 in their report on Leprosy in India, held "that the hereditary taint exercises a most import- ant influence in the transmission of the pest." However, they never speak of an actual transmission of the disease, but merely of a predisposition. There can be no doubt that this difference of opinion is in great part due to the fact that authors have not drawn a clear enough distinction between "hereditary transmission of a dis- ease" and "inherited predisposition to a disease." Even now writers talk loosely of the inheritance of carcinoma and tuber- culosis, while a predisposition is evidently all that can be claimed. A second mistake, which apparently has been often committed, is that, in their enquiries regarding the condition of the parents, authors have been satisfied with merely ascer- taining that the parent or parents were in a diseased condition. But such information is clearly insufficient. In each case, where family taint is possible as a legitimate tiological factor, it is necessary to enquire also into the time at which the parent or parents were affected. If a child be born of parents who acquire a disease some time after the birth of such child, and the offspring eventually becomes affected also, we cannot ascribe this to inheritance of a specific diseased condition. Such condition can be transmitted to the offspring, only if it were possessed by the parent before the. birth of the child. Leloir lays particular stress on this point.

206               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Unfortunately, at the commencement of their investigations, the Commissioners omitted to enquire closely into these cir- cumstances. Thus it frequently happened at that time that no question was asked as to whether or not the parent or parents were healthy at the time of the child's birth. This, as will be seen presently, must materially affect the statistical results, and allowance should be made for this oversight. However, in every case where no statement has been made regarding the condition of the parent at the time of the birth of the offspring, this has been taken as a case of genuine transmission. Nevertheless, even with this admission, the statistical results do not affect the conclusions arrived at by the Commission, as will be fully explained later on. After due consideration of all the evidence obtained by means of an examination of over 2,000 cases, the Commissioners have come to the conclusion that leprosy in India cannot be consi- dered an hereditary disease, and they would even venture to say that the evidence which exists is hardly sufficient to establish an inherited specific predisposition to the disease by the offspring of leprous parents to any appreciable degree. These deduc- tions have been drawn from the following facts, which, as far as the nature of the matter permits, will be given in tabular form. Before proceeding-further a few general remarks should be made on the subject of hereditary predisposition and transmis- sion, and these will be illustrated by examples derived from the knowledge of tuberculosis. Leprosy and tuberculosis resemble one another in many respects, and the tiology of the latter disease has been more calmly and carefully considered. Tuberculosis is essentially a disease of extra-uterine life, and though hereditary in certain instances it is not so as a disease, but as a predisposition. This assertion is not modified in consequence of the two cases published by Landouzy and Martin, Birch-Hirschfeld and Schmorl respectively.8 For in (8) Supplement to the British Medical Journal, June 6th and 27th, 1891.
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.             207 neither case were any tubercles found in the ftal organs, though the presence of tubercle bacilli was proved by micros- copical observation and animal experiment. The ftus was still born in either case, and there is thus much room left for speculation as to the ultimate fate of the child, if it had lived. A distinction must clearly be drawn between a congenital or hereditary disease and an infection from the parent through the placental circulation of the child. Instances of congenital tuberculosis have been recorded from time to time, but still are so extremely rare and often also so uncertain as not to invalidate the above statement. When the influence of heredity in a disease such as leprosy is under discussion, and it is known or proved that the disease itself is not the thing transmitted from parent to child, but only the predisposition to it, great care and caution must be exercised in finding out how far in each case the congenital predisposition has not only been inherited, but also inherited in a legitimate manner. That is, this question must be consider- ed, how far the leprosy of the child is due to the leprosy of its ancestor and how far due to other morbid conditions of the parent, which may have transmitted a congenital predisposition to the child. It must not be forgotten that in leprosy as in tuberculosis a predisposition is necessary for the disease to appear at any time. This predisposition may be due to many agents and factors, and it may therefore be quite possible that the factors which produced the predisposition in the parent, quite apart from the resulting leprosy, may be the cause of the congenital predisposition transmitted to the child. This, how- ever, would not be a legitimate inheritance. Now, where practical questions regarding heredity are under consideration, which may result in such measures as separation of husband and wife or interdiction of marriages between the affected, it is of the utmost importance to study the influence of the disease itself in causing a specific predisposition in the offspring. The fact, acknowledged equally for tuberculosis and
?208                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: leprosy, that the diseases occasionally "skip a generation," speaks strongly in favour of a more general than specific form of inheritance, and hence also for the possibility that a non-tubercular or non-leprous condition of the parent may cause the predisposition in the child necessary for the develop- ment of tuberculosis or leprosy, as the case may be. "With tuberculosis it is certain that in the congenital and developmental conditions of the offspring there is nothing of a dyscrasia. When in a tubercular family one child after another dies of tubercular arachnitis, this proves the existence of a specific dyscrasia as little as when in another family one mem- ber after another becomes insane. From this it can evidently only be argued that the brain and its membranes hereditarily suffer fromc ertain abnormalities. Even the fact that in the same family one child will be affected with tubercular arachnitis, another with tubercular arthritis, and a third with laryngeal phthisis, does in no way prove the existence of a dyscrasia which in one case attacks the arachnoid, in another the bones, and in a third the larynx. These facts can only prove that the exciting causes select one or other part, and that several areas of the body are in the same predisposed condi- tion." Mutatis mutandis the same applies to leprosy. And when it is remembered that a predisposition may just as easily be acquired, it is felt that great stress must be laid on the external surrounding conditions. It is therefore necessary to study the effect of a specific hereditary predisposition pure and simple, and carefully exclude the influence of such external relations. It is evidently not sufficient to argue from the fact that a near relation had leprosy, that therefore the congenital predisposition was specifically or legitimately inherited. The congenital pre- disposition can only be said to have been thus inherited, if the child was actually born of a leprous parent. If born of a parent (9) For these and the preceding remarks also cf. Virchow, loc. cit., pages 718 - 720.
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.             209 who some years, and frequently many years, after the birth of the child becomes a leper, this child cannot possibly be supposed to have inherited a specific leprous predisposition in a legitimate manner. The fact that the parent eventually falls a victim to the disease cannot make the inherited predisposition any more specific or legitimate. This can only prove that certain con- ditions and abnormalities of the parent, which eventually led to the establishment of a predisposition capable of being acted upon by the exciting causes responsible for the development of leprosy, have been transmitted to the offspring. And even this can only be so, if the possibility of an acquired predisposition in either case can be excluded. In an investigation of this nature, therefore, it is necessary first to enquire into the number of cases and families in which a specific hereditary predisposition may be assumed actually to exist, that is, to enquire into the condition of the children born of leprous parents. Then it must be seen whether such speci- fic inherited predisposition has a greater influence on the deve- lopment of the disease than a non-specific congenital predis- position. On this must turn the issue of reformatory measures such as forcible separation of husband and wife and interdiction of marriages. If facts do not establish a greater influence for the former, then the solution of the question cannot be sought in such rigorous rules, but must direct itself to the amelioration of the general external conditions. These considerations have guided all the subsequent argu- ments in a complex and difficult question. I.-A case was never seen of a child leprous at the time of birth, or so shortly afterwards, that it might fairly be considered a congenital case. This point has so often been insisted on by other authors and is so well known a fact that it is unnecessary to comment any further on it. Now it is obviously fatal to the conception of an hereditary transmission of a condition acquir- ed by the parent, if it be established that such condition never appears congenitally. And this fact must be kept in view P
?210                 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION more particularly in the investigation of a disease of bacillary origin, for it is easy to conceive that the ovum or embryo could be invaded by the bacillus. Though this argument tells forcibly against the hereditary transmission of the actual morbid condition or an infection through the placental circulation, a belief in a transmitted specific predisposition might still be maintained. It might be assumed that some constitutional defect causally related to the leprosy of the parent is set up in the embryo, which subse- quently, under favourable conditions, gives rise to the disease. Other facts, however, while still further disproving hereditary transmission, cast doubt also upon the possibility of an inheri- ted specific predisposition. II.-Since leprosy cannot in any case be regarded as a congenital disease, an enquiry must be made as to how often it is possible to trace a family taint in the direct line, from parent to offspring, and to this question the discussion in this chapter will be wholly confined. From collateral relationship little, if anything, can be argued, as here so inextricable a maze of transmissions exists that it is impossible to disentangle one factor from another. If the facts available with regard to family taint in the direct line be not sufficient to establish inheritance, then  fortiori, argu- ments from collateral relationships must be altogether without force. Dr. Vandyke Carter,10 who collected information from all parts of the Bombay Presidency, gives a most careful and exhaustive table showing the number and proportion of blood relations, and found that about 20 per cent. of lepers acknow- ledged a family taint. In 14.5 per cent. of these, however, the taint was in the collateral line. As cousins are included in these 14.5 per cent., it may be submitted that with so much ad- mixture of alien blood little can be deduced from the figures. Arguments and deductions from distant relationships, as e.g. (10) Vandyke Carter: loc. cit. page 184.
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.              211 from grandparent to grand-child are of still less force, and of no real scientific value for the subject under discussion. In fact they argue rather against a specific inherited predisposition. It may be well here to repeat the words of Hjort, quoted by Dr. Liveing: 11 "From time to time the relationship of many hundred lepers to each other has been carefully investigated, and the result has shown that many of them are more or less akin, and hence the conclusion has been drawn that the disease was hereditary in all those lepers who were related." It will be plain to all that this conclusion does not rest on a sound basis, and that a malady can only be inherited when the seeds thereof pass in a direct line from parents to children, while those persons who are only collaterally related cannot inherit the dis- ease one from another. Lastly, when the term "atavism" is used in support of the theory of heredity, and marked "as a form of inheritance worthy of special notice on account of its frequent occurrence," a protest must be raised against the unwarrantable introduction into human pathology of a term which, whatever its place may be in the province of biological speculations, must remain meaningless to the pathologist en- quiring into the tiology of so markedly a general disease as leprosy. In the study of the inheritance of embryological deformities atavism may be of great importance, but if the term is employed to denote the sudden appearance of a constitu- tional disease after having "skipped one or several generations," it is inapplicable. Atavism can have no place in the tiology of leprosy. Collateral and distant relationships may consequently be disregarded, and the present enquiry is confined to the number of instances in which a family taint could be ascertained to exist in direct lines of descent. This will best be given in a tabular form. The first column of the following table specifies the name of the asylum or locality where the lepers were ex- (11) R. Liveing: loc. cit., page 85. P 2

?214               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: It will thus be seen that what might be regarded as an hereditary taint in the direct line could be traced in only 130 cases out of 2,371, or in 5.48 per cent. Now, in 74 cases out of the 130 either no statement was made as to the condition of the parent or parents at the time of the child's birth or some doubt was expressed as to diagnosis, and allowing for this, it would perhaps be nearer the mark to say that a true family taint in the direct line could be established in about 4 per cent. of the cases seen. Family taint in the direct line is, therefore, established in only a few cases, and, consequently, as far as these figures go, one is forced to look for other and more potent causes for the origin of the disease. If the results of Hegh and Bidenkap,12 who traced the disease in the direct line in 25 per cent., and further those of Van Sommeren,13 who amongst 31 cases found only two hereditary ones, prompted Virchow to the remark that heredity cannot explain the spread of the disease, how much less do the above figures justify the belief in the high import- ance of an hereditary influence ? Table I has been constructed from the cases actually seen and examined by the Commissioners. As, however, many patients confessed to having leprous children or parents, either deceased or absent, it is necessary to construct another table including all these cases. This is done in Table II which is arranged on the same plan as the previous one. (12) Hegh and Bidenkap: Norsk Magazin for Lagevidenskaben, 1860, Vol. XIV.

?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.              217 Thus according to this enlarged table it is seen that a family taint in the direct line existed in 6 per cent., a higher percentage than the corresponding ratio of the former table. But, on the other hand, the number of cases noted as doubtful or as wanting in the detailed statement is greater, and as the additional 52 lepers could not be seen, the suspicion of a wrong diagnosis also is not excluded. Making allowance for all these factors it may be said that this second table fairly represents a percentage of 4.5 of a possible heredity, so that the conclusions derived from a comparison of these two tables are more or less in harmony, and as far as such figures go, establish only to a slight degree the existence of a family taint, and 4 per cent. might, therefore, fairly be accepted as representing the ratio of a specific family taint in the direct line. These figures tend to confirm Hansen's disbelief in an inherited specific predisposition. In constitutional diseases such as leprosy the greatest caution must be exercised in accepting any theory of inheritance. As the importance of inheritance as an tiological factor vanishes, so that of exter- nal conditions must rise into prominence. And parent and child being subjected usually to exactly similar surrounding conditions and circumstances, it is well within the bounds of probability that the disease has started de novo in both. One might otherwise with equal reason classify rickets amongst the hereditary diseases. Now that the pathology of ftal rickets has been elucidated, it is well known that rickets is a disease of bad nutrition and is never congenital or hereditary; yet it would not be difficult in London to find a family taint in 4 per cent. of rickety patients. Unless the influence of external causes can be excluded, and an inheritance proved in a majority of cases and on sound evidence, the hereditary trans- mission of, or specific predisposition to a disease cannot be said to be established. A protest must be raised when such cases as quoted by M. de Valenc are considered convincing
?218               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: proofs of an hereditary transmission.14 For one of his exam- ples of inherited leprosy rests on the "confession of a patient, that he vaguely remembered having heard that his maternal grandmother had had leprosy."15 His parents apparently were healthy and he himself was certainly untainted when his three children were born. Two of the latter became leprous and died before the patient himself was affected. The details in the history of inheritance of the other case are too insuffi- cient. Of four sisters and two brothers of apparently healthy descent, the two latter became diseased. One of them died without issue, while the other had a leprous son. " The sisters had children affected with leprosy, and it is possible at the present day to trace easily the descendants of these four sisters and enumerate the members of the family who died from the disease."16 Thus as the case stands, a transmission by inheritance can at best only be established from one of the brothers to his son. Yet this evidence, in a leading article of the Lancet,17 has been described as convincing on the ques- tion of hereditary transmission. It is on this account only, that notice had to be taken of M. de Valenc's paper. The great importance of external conditions in the tio- logy of leprosy must be admitted, and the figures therefore tend to reduce the importance of inheritance so greatly, that practically it may be altogether disregarded. Again, if heredity have an appreciable influence on the spread or origin of the disease, it should be possible to trace leprosy through several generations in a sufficiently large num- ber of cases. In each instance, therefore, when a family taint in the direct line was acknowledged, careful enquiries were made as to the condition of the grand-parents. Only eighteen (14)  Lancet, 1890, Vol. I, page 1077. (15)  Lancet, 1890, Vol. I, page 1065. (16) Lancet, 1890, Vol. I, page 1077. (17) Lancet, 1890, Vol. I, page 1065.
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.             219 cases could be obtained where the disease could be traced from the grandfather or grandmother downwards. Now in five cases the statements were insufficient or the diagnosis of leprosy doubtful (Nos. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9), and in further six cases the children were in each instance born of healthy parents, so that the conditions are such as to exclude an inherited specific predisposition (Nos. 1, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). These cases will now be given in an analysed form. TABLE 11a. Analysis of Cases where a Family Taint in the Direct Line could be traced through more than One Generation.

(k) Thayetmyo: (18) Mother=Leper (HER OWN FAMILY HISTORY WAS CLEAR). Seven children and one of them=Leper. Two children and one of them=Leper (DIAGNOSIS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL). Here no statements were made as to date of appearance of leprosy in the parents. Even allowing that in a certain number of cases the patients knew little of their grandparents, if heredity exercised any appreciable influence on the spread of leprosy, it should have been possible to obtain a far greater number of cases where the disease could be traced through two generations at least. As, however, all the doubtful cases have been included, the figures may be assumed to represent the truth as nearly as possible. Accepting even all the eighteen cases the ratio would still be less than 1 to 100. Now in a disease like le- prosy it may be urged that in most leprous families the grand- children would have knowledge of the condition of their imme- diate ancestors. Again this analysis shows the necessity of a careful enquiry in each case into the time at which the parent or parents became leprous, for it would evidently be absurd to consider Case 13 an instance of hereditary transmission, as here the grandchild actually acquired the disease before the common ancestor. In Cases 1 and 14 the child also became affected before the mother. In such instances it obviously cannot be a specific predisposition based on the existence of leprosy in the parent which has been transmitted to the off- spring. If a predisposition has been transmitted to the child, it must have been the physiological or anatomical conditions which have rendered the ancestor a favourable subject for the
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.               223 de novo acquisition of the disease, but it is certainly not a legitimate inheritance of a leprous predisposition. For whatever the child inherited it would have inherited, whether the parent subsequently became a leper or not. And excluding conta- gion it may be quite possible that in all the members of the family the disease started de novo, the necessary predisposition having been acquired. To allow such cases as proofs of an inherited specific predisposition would obviously be a " post hoc ergo propter hoc " argument. III.-From the fact that leprosy occurs often in several members of a family, authors have argued the existence of a specific hereditary predisposition. That such an argument cannot hold good may be seen from the fact that instances oc- cur where two or three brothers or sisters simultaneously suffer, although they are not aware that they had any leprous ances- tors. Leloir lays special stress on this point; and doubtless if it can be shown with sufficient frequency that several children become affected, while the parents remain healthy, this fact, coupled with the small percentage of direct family taint, found in the present enquiry, would still further diminish the import- ance of heredity as a cause of the continuance of the disease. It would tend to show that individuals habitually exposed to the same conditions are liable to be affected in the same man- ner. And as often years elapse between the appearance of the disease in two children of the same family, it reduces the import- ance of heredity still further. The fact of the parent being a leper before the birth of the child does not alter this statement, for it has been found in many cases that the son of a leprous parent contracted the disease long before his younger brother, destined subsequently to become a leper, was born. Enquiring into this matter, it is found that in 101 instances, or in about 4.5 per cent. of the cases examined, two or more children became lepers, while their parents were perfectly healthy, and in most of these cases no other relative was affected. The correspondence of this ratio with the above is remarkable.
224               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: In this case heredity can of course have played no part, as it is impossible to look to atavism for support, for the reasons assigned above. The conclusion is strongly suggested that though the disease in a small proportion of cases appears to run in families, this cannot be ascribed to a specific inherited predisposition.

As will be seen from the subjoined table, 98 leprous couples had 65 children, and of these three became lepers. Two cases were so exceedingly doubtful that they may justly be excluded. Thus it is found that 4.6 per cent., or accepting the doubtful cases, 7.6 per cent. of the issue of leper marriages have contracted the disease. Some, though very few, of the children were still young, and one or two of them may subse- quently develop leprosy. These figures therefore lead to re- sults almost identical with those of Tables I and II. Yet here the most favourable conditions for the full play of inheritance existed, and nevertheless, the actual percentage of hereditary cases is less. If a specific hereditary transmission exercised any considerable influence, a much greater number of the 65 children should have become affected. And in order that no misapprehension may exist regarding the value of the figures given in Table IV, particular attention is drawn to the fact that the majority of these cases of the issue of leprous parents Q
?226              REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: are adults, perfectly healthy, some married and with healthy children. A certain number, on the other hand, died healthy. These figures, therefore, give little support to the view of a legitimately inherited predisposition to the disease. TABLE IV. Cases where Father and Mother were Lepers at the Time of Marriage.

V.-The only decisive way of disentangling the influence of heredity and external conditions would be to imitate the
Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition.             227 experiment of the emigrant Norwegian lepers, and to remove the offspring of lepers not only from their parents but also into an area where leprosy is not endemic. Placed under such con- ditions, with good food and hygienic surroundings, heredity would have full and absolute play. There are two asylums in India where children born of leprous parents are kept apart from them and tended with great care; this is done at Almora and Purulia. The latter unfortunately has not been sufficiently long in existence, hardly more than two years. The Almora Orphanage, however, is much older and thus capable of afford- ing very valuable information. The children born of either one or two leper parents are removed from their surroundings and carefully attended to in the Orphanage. Endemic influences cannot of course be excluded. Drs. Lewis and Cunningham18 say in their report: "There are at present (1877) in the Orphanage of Almora 12 children of lepers now or formerly in the Asylum. The total number of such children who have been admitted into the Orphanage is 14, but of these 1 died, and another, a girl of 22, has now left the Orphanage, is married, and has children healthy to all appearance. Of the 12 remain- ing 7 were born in the Asylum of two leprous parents; 5, the offspring of one leprous and one healthy parent, were born in the villages to which their parents belonged. Their ages ranged from 19 to 5 years; their health and general condition is excellent, and as yet they show no signs of leprosy." The Commissioners were able to ascertain the correspond- ing facts with regard to 23 inmates of the Orphanage. Of these three were born before the manifestation of the disease in the parent, their ages being 31, 28, and 19, respectively, and five were under 10 years, their ages ranging from 7 years to 6 months (7, 7, 4, 3, and 1/2 years, respectively). All these eight individuals were up to date in good health. This leaves 15 cases, and of these, as will be seen from Table V, only 1 has (18) Loc. cit., page 67. Q 2
?228 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION : contracted the disease, all the others having remained perfectly well, or having died free from leprosy in adult age. The number of children is certainly not a large one, and deductions should naturally be made with care, but the figures, especially if compared with the other ratios obtained, tend still further to diminish the importance of heredity. For omitting the eight cases, for the reasons mentioned, an assumed hereditary trans- mission was traceable in 6.6 per cent. TABLE V. Almora Asylum Orphanage.  No. Sex. Age.

?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 229 VI.-In the fourth section the condition of children born of two leprous parents was enquired into. Here the condition of all the children born after the manifestation of the disease in one or other parent will be considered. It must be remarked that in many cases the children could not be personally exam- ined by the Commissioners, and in these cases the parent's statements had to be accepted. Doubtless this is a source of error and due allowance must be made. It was found that amongst 500 children of all ages born of either two leprous parents, or from one leper parent and one healthy parent, 21, or 4.2 per cent., became lepers. In eight of these the existence of the disease was extremely doubtful, while in some others no statements were made as to the condition of the parent or parents at the time of the child's birth. Even if 19 be accepted as the actual number of the offspring attacked, the ratio yielded very nearly approaches the truth. But as some children were still young it may be objected that they had not yet reached the age at which leprosy generally shows itself, and it is desir- able to re-arrange the offspring in two classes-(a) all those of ten years and over, and (b) all those of sixteen years and over. Taking ten as the minimum age, it was found that there were 150 individuals born after the appearance of the disease in the parent or parents, and of these 10 had become lepers, or 6.6 per cent. Again, taking sixteen as the minimum age, there were 82 individuals born of leprous parents, of whom six subsequently contracted the disease, or 7.31 per cent. Making all allowances for errors in diagnosis and inaccurate statements, it will be apparent that the figures correspond closely with those of former tables.

VII.-Lastly, the influence of an inherited specific predis- position may be studied by the selection of cases in which a family taint in the direct line can be traced, and by an enquiry into the condition of the brothers and sisters. Now, as was shown above, in many instances where there is evidence of a family taint, the patients were born at a time when their fathers and mothers were absolutely healthy though they after- wards became lepers. These cases might be termed instances of "false heredity." Again others were actually born of a leper parent or parents. If new tables be constructed with a view to showing how many of the brothers and sisters of lepers with a "false" hereditary history have become lepers in com- parison with the number of brothers and sisters of lepers with a "true" hereditary history who have become lepers, addi-
Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 235 tional light will be thrown upon the influence of heredity. For, in the former case, the predisposition cannot have been legitimately inherited, and, if hereditary, must be related to general non-specific conditions of the parent. In the case of patients actually born of leprous parents great care has been taken to ascertain that their brothers and sisters were also born after the manifestation of the disease in the parent or parents. In some cases no statements were made, and it is quite possible that some of the brothers and sisters were born at a time when their immediate ancestors were healthy. In other cases, with regard to the patient himself, whose brothers and sisters form the subject of the present enquiry, no state- ment was made as to whether he or she had a true or false history of heredity. These cases have been entered as though they were instances of true heredity, and thus errors in statis- tics are more or less counterbalanced, and the statistics placed in a more favourable light from the heredity point of view. It has been found that 62 patients with a true hereditary history had 156 brothers and sisters born also, as far as could be ascertained, after the manifestation of the disease in their fathers and mothers; and of these 21 became lepers, or 13.4 per cent. On the other hand, 61 patients, with a history of false heredity, had 150 brothers and sisters, and of these 31, or 20.6 per cent., were lepers. This is certainly a most surprising result, and, if coupled with the number of instances of several children becoming lepers while their parents remained healthy, removes the importance attributed to a specific hereditary predisposition. The figures are certainly somewhat small, but yet allow of decisive conclusions being drawn from them. Now, even if the cases with insufficient statements be excluded from Table IX, and added to Table X, the ratio would still militate against the influence of an actual heredity. For, in spite of making such allowances, the ratio could not be reduced below 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. This appears to be a strong argument against
236 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: inheritance, for if this agency had much influence the ratios  should not only be reversed, but the percentage of lepers in Table IX ought to be much greater than that of Table X. The only inference to be drawn from these tables, and from the fact of children being often affected though their parents remain healthy, is that leprosy appears to have a tendency to attack several members of a family, but that a legitimate specific hereditary transmission cannot be regarded as the cause. In another place it will be shown whether contagion can explain this fact. It should never be forgotten that a disease due to extraneous agents and conditions, such as leprosy seems to be, may at any time affect people living in similar surroundings and possessing similar constitutions. And it is precisely amongst the members of a family that we get such conditions and relations. However this will be dealt with more fully in the chapter on Contagion. TABLE IX.

A glance at Tables IX and X might at first sight lead to the belief that the children born of lepers or of parents who became lepers at any time after the birth of these children suffer more frequently from leprosy than do the children born of people remaining free from the disease. To enquire into the truth of this statement a Table, Xa, has been added to show the condition of the brothers and sisters of leprous patients born of parents healthy before and after the birth of such patients. It has been found that 850 patients had 2,853 brothers and sisters, of whom 97, or 3.4 per cent., subse- quently contracted leprosy. On the other hand, from Tables IX and X, it will be seen that 123 patients with a history of "true" or "false" heredity had 306 brothers and sisters, of whom 52, or 17.0 per cent., subsequently became affected. Does this prove a specific hereditary influence or predis- position? Now it is evident that from Table IX no conclusion can be drawn as to the fate of the offspring of leprous parents as a whole, for here only those families have been selected where one parent and one child at least are lepers, and where a specific hereditary influence may actually be assumed to exist, the child in each instance being born of a leprous parent. All those cases, however, have been omitted where a leprous parent had absolutely healthy children. Table IX does not
?240 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: therefore assert anything about all the children born of leprous parents. How many of these become diseased has been con- sidered in previous paragraphs. Selecting, however, those families where, through the fact that one child is affected like its parent, a specific hereditary predisposition is granted to exist-and of such only a small number was found-Table IX shows that contrary to expectation of 218 children with such an inherited predisposition only 83, or 38 per cent., became lepers. That this ratio should be higher than in Table Xa simply amounts to stating that in these families the assumed hereditary taint actually exists, but it says nothing as to the number of children born of leprous parents who subsequently become lepers. Table IX, therefore, clearly cannot be con- trasted with Table Xa with a view of finding out the greater predisposition of the offspring of leprous parents as a whole. A similar objection must be raised when Table X is em- ployed to prove the same assumption. For here only those families are chosen where one child at least became a leper, while those children which permanently remained healthy have been excluded. To make the conclusion as to the offspring in general a legitimate one, all the children born of such parents who, though healthy at the time of birth of these children, subsequently became lepers, should be considered. A com- parison of Tables X and Xa can evidently only prove this, that in those families where a parent becomes a leper after the birth of his children, and where also at least one of these children subsequently becomes a leper, the children as a whole are more liable to suffer from the disease, just as a comparison of Tables IX and Xa can only show that in those families where at least one parent is a leper before the birth of his children, and where also at least one of these children subse- quently becomes a leper, the children as a whole are somewhat more liable to suffer from the disease than the children in those families where the parents are healthy, and remain so, while at least one child is a leper.
Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 241 But clearly all this does not prove anything in favour of a specific hereditary predisposition causally related to the leprosy in the parent. In fact, it argues strongly for an acquired predisposition both by the parents and the children, and this in the case of the latter may have been facilitated by some congenital abnormality not related to leprosy, but inherited from the former. On the other hand, it seems astonishing from a considera- tion of Table Xa, that selecting those families where the parents were healthy, but one child at least a leper, of 850+2,853 or 3,703 children 850+97 or 947 individuals, or 25 per cent., should have become lepers, though the parents, as far as could be ascertained, were free from any family taint in the direct line. The same percentages for Tables IX and X would be 37 and 43.6, respectively. It might now be well to compare these figures with results obtained from a consideration of such fami- lies where the parents remained healthy, and were confessedly free from any family taint in the direct line, but at least two of the children were lepers. It will be seen from Table Xb that in such families 96 patients had 292 brothers and sisters, of whom 111 were lepers: or that selecting these families, of 388 children 207, or 53.3 per cent., were diseased. This is very instructive, as though here an hereditary specific predisposition is excluded as rigorously as possible, yet the disease shows a predilection for certain families. It is only when examined in this light, that deductions re- garding the offspring as a whole can be made with a view to elicit the influence of a specific hereditary predisposition. Now as individuals of alien blood, such as husbands and wives of lepers who live with the family under similar conditions, suffer to the extent of from 5 to 6 per cent., the above arguments are strengthened.19 Evidently all that can be argued from these considerations is, that leprosy in a certain number of instances (19) Cf. Chapter on Contagion. R
?242 Report of the Leprosy Commission : has a tendency to affect several members of a family, but that this is not due to a specific hereditary predisposition.

Aligarh 6 12 1 It must be remarked, that in several instances when the brothers and sisters of a leper were healthy, their number had not been enquired into, or at times no mention at all made of them. On the other hand, whenever a leper had a leprous brother or sister, full information has always been given. Taking due consideration of this fact, it is evident that the per- centage at the end of this table is too high. Agra, Bombay, Calicut, Hyderabad, Subathu and Tarn Taran have been omitted on account of in- sufficient details. Omissions, however, though few, exist also in some of the other stations.

?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 245 VIII.-Before giving a summary of this chapter, a few remarks must be made upon a point which has an important bearing on the question of heredity: what will be the risk of increase to the leper population, assuming heredity to be a more or less influential agent in the spread of the disease? This matter was thoroughly gone into by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham,20 who came to the conclusion that " taking all the information attainable there appears to be no great risk of increase to the leper population of Kumaun as far as the disease is dependent on heredity for its multiplication." Following their line of argument, it will be seen, by referring to Table XI, that 2,915 children were born before or after the manifestation of leprosy in the parent or parents. Almora and Meerut have been left out of consideration, because the total number of children could not be obtained in all instances where both the parents were lepers. Strictly speaking, only the children actually born of lepers should be considered. However, as here the greatest possible increase to the leper population is under discussion, and this matter is simply a side issue to the question of heredity and of practical rather than scientific value, all objections will be waived, and all the children included. Thus the case will be stated as strongly as possible. Besides, the fact exists that whether the parent was a leper before or after the birth of his children, a certain number of the latter suffer at one time or another. Whether this is due to a specific hereditary influence has been previously discussed, and for the present purpose it will be best simply to accept the fact, and enquire what would be the probable increase to the leper population. In Table XI all those children who died in infancy have been excluded for obvious reasons. Now 2,915 children have been the issue of 1,564 marriages. These marriages have been grouped together in Tables XII and XIII. Of these 71 were contracted by individuals both suffering from the disease, so (20) Loc. cit., page 63.
246 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: that these would represent 142 lepers. This is not quite cor- rect, as some patients married twice. But while facilitating calculations, it will in no way affect the ratio, and moreover will compensate for omissions among the other leper marriages. These were contracted between a leper and a healthy person and amount to 1,493. Thus 1,493 lepers must be added to the above 142, which gives a total of 1,635. In the case of the 1,493 marriages between a healthy and an affected person the fact that in a few instances the healthy individual subsequently became diseased has been neglected, and thus matters will be equalised. The 1,635 lepers would be replaced by 2,915 children. A few of the children have already died, but as this fact was not consistently enquired into, it will be best to consider them all to be alive. The 1,635 lepers therefore have contributed a per- manent addition of 1,280, for 1,635 of the children must be deducted as merely replacing their leprous ancestors. Now it is certain that all the children would not become lepers. At present only 78 of the children are affected, but this small number may be due to the fact that many of them are still young, and it may be reasonably expected that some of them will show manifestations of the disease at a more advanced age. Tables VII and VIII fully justify this suspicion. How- ever, a certain proportion of them are adults and married and have healthy children. Taking everything into consideration, it is unlikely that more than 5 per cent. of the 2,915 children will become lepers. This would indicate that of the total number of children born up to the present, 145 only are likely to become lepers through the agency of heredity. Hence a leprous population of 1,635 individuals may be expected to transmit the disease to 145. This latter number, as far as the statistical tables show, is too high. It would appear probable from Tables VI, VIII, and XI that about 80 of the children would become lepers through the assumed influence of heredity.
?Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 247 Thus there is no danger of a spread of the pest by heredi- tary transmission and predisposition. In fact the figures show conclusively that not only could there be no increase to the leper population by means of this agency, but that all other causes being removed, the disease must die out. It is, on the strength of these data, not astonishing to find that the disease should have been practically extirpated amongst a community like the above-mentioned Norwegians, who forsook their own country and wandered into fresh areas and surroundings, apparently out of reach of the factors capable of originating the disease. To this point, however, reference will be made when considering the question of contagion,  TABLE XI. Children born Before and After Manifestation of Disease in  Parent or Parents.

The latter point is well established, and Drs. Lewis and Cunningham have drawn attention to it so prominently in their report that it would be useless to enter into any further discussion upon the subject. It may therefore be stated that  * Of these 45 were severally contracted by two persons, both lepers.
?252 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: a certain number of children born of leprous parents would be probably shortlived. There is also no doubt that the reproductive power of lepers is diminished. It is fully established through clinical and pathological observation, that leprosy causes extensive morbid changes in the sexual glands and disturbs the sexual functions. That this applies to men has never been denied. But that it is equally true of women has been proved by Dr. Arning,21 who also demonstrated the existence of a leprous ovaritis. It has been shown from Table IV that the issue of 98 marriages between two lepers amounts to only 65. Again Table XIII shows that of 85 couples no less than 55, or 64.7 per cent., were sterile. Hence, assuming all the 65 children to live and grow up, according to these figures 168 lepers (cf. Table XIII) would be replaced by 65 persons, that is, there would be an actual decrease of 62 per cent. in such a popula- tion. Assuming that 5 per cent. of the 65 children became lepers, it seems that 168 lepers would be replaced by 3 or 4 lepers, or if the diffusion of the disease depended on heredity only, there would be an actual decrease of almost 99 per cent. in the leprous population. No doubt these figures are small, yet they allow of the following conclusions:-(a) There is no evidence that marriages among lepers in any way per se in- crease the risk of diffusing the disease, as far as heredity is concerned. (b) Even allowing the latter the fullest play and setting aside all other causes of leprosy, the disease would gradually die out in such a population as has just been consi- dered. Intermarriages, therefore, amongst lepers cannot be regarded as harmful to the community, or as calculated to spread the disease, so far as this depends on hereditary trans- mission or predisposition. But how does the case stand when the marriages between a healthy person and a leper are considered ? It is more diffi- (21) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee: No. 2, Feb. 1891, page 127.
Hereditary Transmission and Predisposition. 253 cult to acquire absolutely accurate information from the data obtainable, and the following statements must be regarded as suggestive only. In almost every instance husbands and wives were healthy at the time of marriage, and one or other con- tracted the disease some years later. It would evidently not be fair to compare the numbers of children born before, with those born after, the appearance of the disease in either hus- band or wife, and then draw deductions as to the influence of leprosy on the reproductive power. For, firstly, in a large number of cases one person forsakes the other as soon as the disease becomes marked, and, secondly, by the time the disease manifests itself the age of the patient is often so advanced that the loss of reproductive power may be attributed to organic and functional causes. Two tables have been prepared (Tables XIV and XIVa) to show how far leprosy may be said to influence the repro- ductive power of the persons affected. Only such persons have been chosen who cohabited for at least five years after the appearance of the disease, and all patients over forty years of age have been rigorously excluded. In this manner it may be hoped to obtain a few suggestive facts. In Table XIV such marriages where the husband only was a leper have been grouped together, and it is found that of 296 couples 176, or 594 per cent., had no issue after the appearance of the disease in the husband, while the progeny of the 120 non-sterile couples amounted to only 249 indivi- duals. That is, under the assumed conditions, the average number of children to each couple amounts to less than one. Again from Table XIVa it is seen that of 88 couples where the wives only were affected, no children were born in 62 instances after the manifestation of the disease, the total number of children born to the diseased mothers amounting to 49. Thus 704 per cent. of the women became sterile with the appearance of the disease, and the average number of children to each is considerably less than one.
254 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Though these statistics evidently cannot represent the absolute truth, they at least justify the belief in a loss of pro- creative power causally related to leprosy, and tend to diminish the fear of a diffusion of the disease through marriage with lepers. This is also fully borne out by the history of the leper settlement at Kalawao (Hawaii).22 The latter was established in 1866, and 2,864 persons were consigned there as lepers from that time to 1884. At the end of this period of eighteen years, 26 children survived who had been born at the settle- ment of leper parents, and only two of these 26 were lepers. From all these considerations then it may fairly he con- cluded that marriages among lepers, and with lepers, do not increase the risk of a diffusion of leprosy by means of the offspring, and that this to a great extent is due to the rela- tive sterility of lepers, whether males or females.

?258 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Summary. The Commissioners have thus come to the conclusion that there is no evidence that leprosy in India is transmitted through heredity from parent to child, their reasons being- (1) no authentic congenital case has ever been put on record, nor was one seen in this country; (2) true family histories of leprosy could be obtained in only 5 or 6 per cent. of the cases; (3) many instances occur of children being affected while their parents remain perfectly healthy; (4) the percentage of children, the result of leper marriages, who become lepers is too small to warrant the belief in the hereditary transmission of the disease; (5) the facts obtained from the Orphanage at the Almora Asylum disprove the existence of a speci- fic hereditary predisposition; (6) only 5 or 6 per cent. of the children born after the manifestation of the disease in the parents be- come subsequently affected; (7) the histories of the brothers and sisters of leper patients with a true or false hereditary taint seem to show that little importance can be attached to inheritance as an agent in the perpetuation of the disease. For the same reasons it may be assumed that the specific hereditary predisposition to leprosy is but slight and practically does not exist. Lastly, it has been shown that taking all the information obtainable and even allowing the fullest influence to heredity, there appears to be no risk of an increase to the leper popula- tion of India, so far as the disease is dependent on heredity for its multiplication, and that marriages with, or intermarriages between, lepers cannot be regarded in the light of a danger to the community.
?Contagiousness of Leprosy 259 CHAPTER V. Contagiousness of Leprosy. ALL modern authorities are agreed that leprosy is an infective disease, that is, one caused by a microbe, the bacillus lepr, which obtains access to the body from without, and subsequently multiplies within the organism, calling forth the characteristic lesions. The next point to be decided is whether or no leprosy is contagious. It is only too frequently taken for granted that a disease due to a pathogenic germ is necessarily also contagious. That this need not be the case will be shown later on. Here it may suffice to recall to mind two instances of infective diseases which are by no means contagious, viz., malaria and pneumonia. With regard to the contagiousness of leprosy, the views of authors are highly conflicting, and a brief allusion will be made to the statements of some of them. These matters have, during the last few years, been so much before the world that this reference need only be very brief. Flgge1 says: "the diffusion of leprosy by contagion is exceedingly rare and evi- dently can only take place under special and predisposing favourable conditions" (the italics are not Flgge's). Now it may be mentioned at once, as this will guide subsequent arguments, that the more weight is attached to special favour- able conditions, in fact what in clinical language is called " the suitable nidus," the further contagion disappears into the back- ground. Indeed, for all practical purposes-and these are what the legislator or sanitary reformer has to consider-it vanishes altogether. Hansen,2 on the other hand, is a contagionist, and expresses (1) C. Flgge: Die Mikroorganismen. Leipzig, 1886, page 221. (2) A. Hansen: Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 2, and Lancet, June 28, 1880, page 1431. S 2
?260 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION. himself thus: "I do not know the way in which leprosy is communicated or transferred from a leper to a sound person but I am most inclined to believe that it is done by a sort of inoculation, that there is wanted a very intimate intercourse and some defect in the integument of the infected." Now, in the chapter on Heredity mention has been made of Hansen's researches in America. And it seems strange that he should consider the fate of the emigrated Norwegian lepers an absolute proof against an hereditary transmission of the disease, while he is unwilling to allow that the same argument applies  fortiori against contagion. How is the fact to be explained that in a community of one hundred and sixty lepers the disease should die out amongst their descendants, without altogether dis- believing in contagion, or attaching to it a nominal import- ance ? In fact Hansen's facts seem to disprove the theory of contagiousness much more forcibly than that of hereditary predisposition. Leloir,3 who is also a contagionist, defends his views in the following words: "Mais comme l'a bien dit le docteur Vidal le 13 octobre 1885  l'Acadmie de mdecine, il faut remarquer que beaucoup de maladies dont la transmission par voie d'inoculation n'est plus nie aujourd'hui prsentent souvent des inoculations difficiles, irrgulires telles la varicelle, la diph- thrie, telle la tuberculose, etc. On pourrait ajouter  la liste des affections le lupus, l'rysiple lui-mme." This statement challenges some comment. Firstly, there can be no doubt as to the ease with which diphtheria and erysipelas can be inoculated, and it is a well-established clinical fact that these two diseases spread par excellence through contagion. Very few would venture to place them in the same category with leprosy, and attempt to establish any analogy between them and the latter. Secondly, if the contagiousness of leprosy is (3) H. Leloir: Trait Pratique et Thorelique de la Lpre. Paris, 1886, page 301.
?Contagiousness of Leprosy. 261 no greater than that of lupus or tuberculosis, the whole matter will be reduced to a question of abstract scientific interest, and is thereby at once removed from the sphere of the legislator, in so far as such strong measures as segregation and social interference are concerned. No one would ever think of enforcing such measures for lupus or tuberculosis. Lastly, reference must be made to Virchow,4 who, in 1859, was asked by the Norwegian Government to investigate the disease in their country, and examined hundreds of cases. He sums up his views on contagion as follows: "Therefore all we can say is, that all cases of supposed contagion or inoculation brought forward may be explained in various ways, and more- over are so rare that as far as the general tiology of the disease is concerned they may in any case be disregarded.' Practically, leprosy, according to him, does not spread by contagion, though it may scientifically be correct to classify it amongst the contagious diseases. This point will be further considered in another place. Before giving a detailed account of the views held by the Commissioners, it will be necessary to make a few general remarks on some points which should guide the enquirer in a similar research, and also to criticise the forms of argument used by many authors. The importance of the subject will excuse this digression. Firstly, when the question of contagion is under considera- tion, it is of the utmost importance to separate the abstract and scientific meaning of the term contagion from the practical one. It is not sufficient to determine by experiment, or on the evidence of one or two authentic clinical cases, that a disease is infective and contagious, but a careful enquiry must be made into the part played by contagion under ordinary sur- roundings and practical conditions. Secondly, the connotation of the term infection must not (4) R. Virchow: Krankhafte Geschwlste, Vol. II, page 507.
?262 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: be misconstrued or unduly extended. Bacteriological and laboratory researches have certainly contributed much to the knowledge of the tiology of many diseases, but the actual question of contagion cannot be settled in this way. Clinical and epidemiological evidence is of the greatest importance. To elucidate these points, let it be supposed that a disease is known to be an infective one. When it is acknowledged that a disease is infective, all that is asserted is, that "the disease may be transmitted from the affected to the healthy individual," but this premises nothing as to the natural mode of diffusion of the disease in question, and whether, or to what extent, under ordinary practical conditions, such transmission does take place. "The natural mode of transmission of an infective disease depends on the faculty pathogenic germs possess of leaving the body of the diseased in the full posses- sion of their power of setting up an infection. If they be thrown off from any surface of a diseased organism in sufficient quantity, and in a sufficiently resistant state, a transmission of the disease from the affected to the healthy person may take place, and the diffusion of the disease in such cases, under certain conditions, may be effected through contagion.* If, however, the pathogenic germs reproduced in the body of the diseased person never leave the latter, or only do so without possessing the power of causing subsequent infection, the in- fective disease caused by such germs is non-contagious. The germs in such cases must have a place somewhere, whence they can always de novo attack the healthy organism."5 Amongst the infective contagious diseases remarkable differences exist as to the degree of contagiousness, depending partly on the unequal liability of the healthy body to be invad- ed by germs, and partly on the resistance and quantity of * If, however, the germs or their spores already are, or become, widely distributed throughout space, the risk of contagion may be disregarded as compared with the de novo acquisition of the disease. (5) C. Flgge loc. cit. and also Flgge: Grundriss der Hygiene, page 466.
?Contagiousness of Leprosy. 263 germs leaving the diseased body. Again, the paths by which the microbes can enter may be such as only in rare cases permit of their establishing themselves within the tissues, and finally, the human body may possess certain protective means which offer great obstacles to the attacking germ. A disease may thus scientifically be grouped amongst the infective and contagious diseases, and yet practically and cli- nically hardly deserve this name. It is to be regretted that the modern advances of bacteriology and animal inoculations have tended to make not only the public, but also scientific writers, disregard the evidence derived from clinical and epidem- iological experience. Without, for a moment, under-estima- ting the importance of bacteriological and animal experiments, it is necessary to guard against taking a one-sided view of the matter, a tendency to which, in these times, has often been only too manifest. Experimenting, as the bacteriologist gene- rally does, on highly susceptible animals, he easily runs the risk of arguing beyond his premises, and of drawing conclusions from his experiments which he applies without sufficient re- serve to the natural mode of infection. It is quite impossible to deduce the tiology of an infective disease from bacterio- logy alone; clinical and epidemiological observations carefully made must always be taken into account. A susceptible ani- mal may easily be infected by experiment, and yet the case may be quite different with man. The best example to elucidate this point will be found in tuberculosis. The researches of Koch have shown that this disease is not only infective but also contagious. It is, how- ever, equally certain that in the ordinary human surroundings the conditions necessary for the multiplication and proliferation of the tubercle bacilli never exist. The diffusion of the disease depends thus, firstly, on its transmission from one individual to another, and, secondly, on the fact that the bacilli may remain dormant, in the full possession of their virulent properties, for a considerable time, without, however, as was just mentioned,
?264 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: showing any signs of proliferation. They are in fact true parasites. Animals, such as guinea-pigs, are infected with the greatest ease. Again, the tubercle bacillus, as Cornet6 has shown, is widely distributed throughout space without any loss of vigour.  priori one would be inclined to assume that tuberculosis must be a highly contagious disease. But ex- perience teaches beyond doubt that of healthy individuals living in the immediate neighbourhood of phthisical patients, by no means all become affected; "in fact perhaps only slightly more than would become affected if the opportunity for infection were less."7 The disposition of an individual is of the highest importance in bringing about a tubercular infec- tion. In fact, as Flgge says, "the disposition actually gov- erns the mode of diffusion of tuberculosis." And that in tuberculosis the danger of infection is so small is chiefly ex- plained by the fact that the existence of the bacillus, and its introduction into the human body, are not sufficient to bring about the infection without the necessary individual disposi- tion. The causes and nature of such disposition may be unknown, but that it exists no one denies, and its bearing on contagion is evident. The experiments of Monti, Leo, Charrin, Roger, and E. Klein8 have thrown much light on the nature of disposition and susceptibility. These will be more fully alluded to in Chapter VI. The greater the prominence given to this dis- position, the less the absolute influence of contagion becomes. "We notice the best example of an individual disposition in tuberculosis, where the greater or smaller collection of resistent germs around the human body has, as we know from experience, a subordinate importance in the diffusion of the disease. It has become an almost general practice in tuberculosis to counteract (6) G. Cornet: Ueber Tuberculose. Leipzig; and footnote on page 287. (7) C. Flgge: loc. cit., page 219.

?Contagiousness of Leprosy. 265 nearly exclusively this individual disposition, and not, as with other infective diseases, aim at a careful removal of the patho- genic germs."9 Keeping these points in mind the nature of the contagious- ness of leprosy will be discussed from a clinical point of view, and the results gained from bacteriological work will be given in the. Laboratory Report. The evidence collected by the Commissioners during their stay in India can, in the first in- stance, only apply to this empire. They have come to the following conclusion, that though they consider leprosy an in- fective disease, caused by a specific bacillus, and moreover also a contagious disease, they are of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence that leprosy is maintained or diffused by contagion; indeed under the ordinary human surroundings the amount of contagion which exists is so small that it may be disregarded, and no legislation is called for on the lines either of segregation, or of interdiction of marriages with lepers. It would be useless in an enquiry of this nature to take the word of the native inhabitants. That the native ordinarily does not fear the disease may be easily gathered from the fact that in bazaars leprous vendors are not rarely found selling food or sweets. Again, however unclean the natives may consider a leper, as long as he is in the possession of money, he is almost always welcome. The readiness also with which the native police and their officials handled lepers brought up for inspec- tion before the Commissioners was very noticeable. There are of course differences in this respect in the various parts of India, and the Commissioners can only speak with confidence of the places visited. This, however, has already been discussed in another chapter. It has all along struck the Commission that though a native on being questioned will, as a rule, state that leprosy is a contagious disease, yet his own acts do not support his statements. (9) C. Flgge: loc. cit., page 614.
?266 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Neither would it be permissible to be too much guided by the opinions of medical observers in India. The leper, not really being such an outcast or deplorable individual as Eu- ropean opinion considers him to be, is seldom seen in the dispensaries, preferring to haunt bazaars or other crowded places to beg. Most Civil Surgeons have not much oppor- tunity, therefore, of studying the tiology of this disease, with the exception of such of them as happen to have large asylums under their jurisdiction. Moreover, the knowledge that no treatment of an outdoor nature is of any service in these cases prevents Civil Surgeons from encouraging their attendance. The Commission have only been guided by facts obtained by themselves. From these they deduce the following argu- ments against a contagion which they deem worthy of a prac- tical consideration. I. All the cases brought forward and demonstrated to the Commissioners as instances of contagion have broken down with one possible exception. These, as a rule, concerned hospital or asylum servants. A list of these cases is appended at the end of this chapter (Table I). Now it seems very significant that the cases which were supposed to prove the contagion theory, and on which such theory was really based, almost entirely collapsed. II. In not a single case could contagion, or the possibility of contagion, be actually demonstrated in a manner free from objection. The native leper, in an overwhelming majority of instances, offers no suggestion as to the contraction of his disease; denies that he has ever had any contact or intercourse with lepers, and simply accuses fate. Occasionally they men- tioned that for some time they had eaten with lepers, but their stories were in most instances too extravagant for belief. For instance, a patient who had been a sailor, says that while in Demerara, a leper used to visit his ship, and all the crew used to smok ethe same hookah with this leper. Two years later this man contracted leprosy. Similar stories are not rare, but
Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             267 they certainly cannot be regarded seriously. In other cases a man will relate that many years ago he came into contact with a leper. Such statements have led some authors to assume a long incubation period for the disease. Now it may be ques- tioned whether it is still possible to talk of contagion after an incubation period, which, in many instances, must have extend- ed over ten or more years. Whatever view may be taken of this matter, the assumption of an irrationally and disproportion- ately long latent period is certainly a weak point in any theory of contagion. And it becomes still weaker when it is considered that, in the case of leprosy the people who presumably have been exposed to the risk of contagion during this "long incu- bation period," have lived in an endemic area. Special attention was paid by the Commission to the effect of people eating with lepers. Table V, at the end of this chapter, shows that seventy-nine lepers ate and drank for some time out of the same vessels with two hundred and five healthy people, and of the latter 7 per cent. afterwards became lepers (Table V). Now these cases all occurred in families. But it has been shown in Chapter III that leprosy has a tend- ency to appear in families, though the cause of this is not a specific hereditary transmission, nor an hereditary predisposi- tion, but most likely explicable by the fact that the members of a family are more likely to be subjected to the same abiding external causes. But in any case the figures obtained from Table V do not permit a great influence to be conceded to contagion, even if the instances of possible contagion were quite free from all objection. III.  In a family contagion has of course the widest play. However, it has been found that the disease does not spread sufficiently amongst the members of one family to warrant the conclusion that it is contagious to any extent. Table II shows that an assumed contagion could be traced in only 5 per cent. IV.   Again, when the intimate intercourse between man and wife is considered, it is astonishing how seldom the wife
?268                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: "catches" the disease from her husband, or vice vers. Yet it is well known that bacilli may easily be found in the sper- matic fluid,10 and here then there is an opportunity offered for oft-repeated inoculation through the mucous membrane of the genital tract. Yet a case is hardly ever found where bond fide the disease may be assumed to have spread from husband to wife (Tables III and IIIa). V. Next, vaccination has been mentioned as affording a risk of diffusing leprosy. This statement is not borne out by facts ascertained in India. Firstly, the number of persons actually vaccinated in India is very small in comparison with the general population. Taking the total number of people in Bengal, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Punjab, Central Provinces, Berar, Lower Burma, Assam, Madras, Bombay, and Coorg, it appears that in the year 1889 of 7,985,543 children available for vaccination only 2,178,464, or 272 per cent. were vaccinated.11 Secondly, a considerable number of these were vaccinated from the calf. Thirdly, where arm-to-arm vacci- nation is practised, lymph is taken from the vaccinifer at an age when leprosy rarely occurs. Fourthly, the experimental evidence of the Norwegian doctors, quoted by Leloir, seems to indicate that it is highly questionable whether such inocu- lation, as vaccination implies, would be able to produce the disease in another person, even granted that the vaccinifer were a leper, and that the lymph contained bacilli. Lastly, as will be seen more fully from the Laboratory Report, three of the Commissioners vaccinated a number of lepers over healthy and affected areas, and subsequently examined the lymph for the characteristic bacilli. In no case were undoubted leprosy bacilli found, either in the lymph or crusts; of ninety- (10) Nature, Origin, Transmissibility, the Methods  of Propagation and Transmission of Leprosy, by M. E. Besnier. Translated by Surgeon-Major O. Baker. Calcutta, 1889, pages 8 and 10. (11) Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, 1889. Appendix to Section VII, page 164.
Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             269 three specimens only six were slightly suspicious (Table VI at the end of this chapter). It has been ascertained by experiment (Laboratory Reports) that if a blister be raised over apparently healthy skin, its serous fluid will be quite free from the bacilli, while in blisters raised over leprous nodules, bacilli may in some cases be found. And surely no one would ever think of vaccinating an individual over a tubercle or diseased part, or if he did so, would employ such lymph to vaccinate another individual. The practical danger, therefore, of leprosy being diffused in this manner, even supposing the disease to be highly contagious, is minimal. The instances quoted in literature of leprosy being "vaccinated" on to a healthy child are too equivocal and ambiguous to carry much weight.12 Dr. Arning,13 who obtained more positive results and found bacilli in the vaccine lymph, states distinctly that he obtained bacilli only in cases of extensive cutaneous leprosy. The latter fact removes at once all fear, because all vaccinators would have some hesitation in vaccinating from such a person. Surgeon- Major Oswald Baker's results,14 on the other hand, fully agree with those of the Commission, although, in his vaccination experiments, he selected sites solely with reference to the pre- sence of characteristic patches of leprosy. From what has been said it is evident that practically there is no risk of a diffusion of the disease in vaccination from arm to arm. VI. Attempts were made to enquire into the possibility of a leprous community becoming or acting as a centre whence the pest might be diffused amongst the population. A research of this nature is obviously connected with great difficulties in a vast country like India. (12) W. T. Gairdner, Brit. Med. Journ., 1887; and Daubler, Monatschr. f. prakt Dermat. 1889.

270                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: The census returns present strong arguments against such a spread of leprosy, since the ratio figures remain more or less unchanged. An absolute value, however, cannot be attached to these figures, as here the diagnostic powers of laymen and the inaccurate statements of natives are liable to mislead an enquirer. Nevertheless census returns do possess a high relative value, especially if, as in the present instance, opportunities are offer- ed of comparing the statistics of three decennial periods. On these points reference must be made to Chapter III of this report. Tarn Taran allows valuable deductions to be drawn as to the risk of the spread of disease around a leprous community. A quarter of the town, in absolute continuity with the rest, is kept apart for, and inhabited solely by, lepers. This condition of things, however, has not caused a diffusion of the disease among the healthy population, the number of lepers remaining more or less stationary, or, at least, never increasing beyond, the original ratio. Nor has any diffusion, even to the imme- diate neighbourhood of the leper quarter, ever been known to occur. Lepers wander to Tarn Taran to bathe in its holy tank, which is supposed to possess special healing powers, and thus the number of lepers is always maintained. But the disease is not especially prevalent amongst the people of the district, and though this leper quarter has existed for many years, the disease has not increased amongst the original inhabitants. For the figures in support of this statement, reference should be made to Chapter III, where this point is specially discussed. Unfortunately on account of insufficient data this line of argument cannot be followed out. But it may be remarked and taken for what it is worth, that it is an almost universal opinion of scientific and intelligent men in India that a spread of the disease has never been known to take place from a leper centre to its neighbourhood.15 (15) Cf. Chapter II: Belgaum and Bombay.
Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             271 VII.  It is believed in some parts of India, especially in the hill tracts, that those who go barefoot are liable to be directly inoculated with leprosy through wounds or ulcers of the feet. In one station in Burma, visited by the Commissioners, they were informed that leprosy had spread among the members of a school after lepers had been in the habit of walking about the compound. As, however, an examination of some of the supposed lepers in this school showed that several of them were not suffering from this disease, this statement was consi- dered open to doubt. At Almora an opportunity occurred of examining the paths and banks in the asylum compound, on which the lepers were in the habit of walking and sitting. One hundred cover-glasses were prepared from earth taken from these sites, and only ten leprosy bacilli were found in the whole number of specimens. But at present no criterion of a living leprosy bacillus exists, and in any case the small number found in an extended series of observations, on the most favourable material, would sug- gest that the danger of individual inoculation is possible, but that the risk of the diffusion of the disease in this manner is very slight. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that an exa- mination of dust from huts inhabited by lepers suffering from the tubercular and ansthetic types of the disease, and afflict- ed with ulcers on their feet and hands, confirmed the observa- tion of Kaurin,16 who has not succeeded in finding bacilli in the earth, dust or air in the rooms of lepers (Table VII). VIII.  This chapter may be concluded by stating that the Commissioners during their enquiries met with many cases where people, either voluntarily or for various reasons, lived in asylums with lepers, often eating and drinking with them, or smoking with them, perhaps attending to their wants and ail- ments, and yet remained perfectly untainted, often after many (16) Kaurin: Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 2, Feb. 1891, page 68.
?272                    REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: years of such association. The value of such instances may be questionable as evidence against contagion, being entirely on the negative side, still they are highly instructive in throwing light on the practical dangers of contagion, and until an actual positive case, free from all objection, is published, increase in worth. Such an absolutely positive case so far is not known, as a perusal of the Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee will show. In the absence of such information, it is permissible to deny the practical possibility of the spread of leprosy by contagion. A case can only be positive, if it answers all the conditions postu- lated by Virchow: "It must be an observation made with the full assurance and every guarantee of certainty." A study of Tables IVand IVa will show that of one hundred and four persons living with lepers in asylums, under the most favourable conditions for contracting a communicable disease, only one, or possibly two, became lepers (1 or 2 per cent.).. Summary.-In coming to the conclusion that, as far as practical conditions and surroundings are concerned, the danger of leprosy being diffused and spread by contagion is exceeding- ly small, arguments have been used which do not possess the character of novelty. India, however, offers no other, and since extended and numerous experiments obviously cannot be made on man, and knowledge gained from animal inoculations cannot be entirely relevant, deductions can only be drawn from clinical evidence. This clinical evidence, for India at any rate, is strongly against a measurable contagiousness of leprosy. It is in fact with leprosy exactly as with tuberculosis, and all that has been said about the latter affection may be applied equally to the disease which forms the subject of the present enquiry. In leprosy, therefore, the disposition of the individual plays an important part, just as it does in phthisis. With the as- sumption of such disposition the practical importance of con- tagion is reduced to a minimum, and it becomes the duty of the reformer to find means to prevent and counteract this dispos-
?Contagiousness of Leprosy.                              273 ition. With the discovery of the bacillus lepr by Hansen the infective nature of the disease has been finally established, and subsequent experiments have also shown that in the scientific sense of the word the disease must be classed amongst the contagious diseases as defined above. But these facts must not obscure all other evidence, and it must not be forgotten that contagion is but a relative term, and that where reforms and similar measures are under consideration, the actual and concrete influence of contagion is the factor to be considered. This, however, has been shown to be as small as, or even rather less than, in the case of tuberculosis.
?274                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V. Several tables, with some necessary comments, will now be given to illustrate the arguments used in the previous pages. TABLE I. Cases brought forward in Proof of the Contagiousness of Leprosy. (1) Agra.-One of the dressers whose duty it was to rub gurjun oil into the skin of lepers was said to have developed leprosy in consequence. The hospital assistant, however, without being asked, volunteered the statement that this dresser was a leper before he commenced his duties. (2) Ajodhya.-A woman was supposed to have caught the disease from her husband. On visiting her in her own home it became evident that she was not even a leper, but had suffered from paronychia of the thumb of one hand which had led to a slight deformity of the nail and ungual phalanx. (3) Bombay.-(a) A patient in the Trombay Asylum emigrated to Mauri- tius, and returned to India in 1884 with swelling of the eyebrows and black patches on the cheeks. When this asylum was opened in 1885 he began work as a ward boy, and continued in that capacity until a year ago, when signs of leprosy became so marked that he became a patient in the asylum. (b) A student in Bombay, while making an autopsy on a leper, pricked his hand. A short time afterwards he suffered from fever, and the hand became inflamed and swollen. Pain and thickening in the course of the ulnar nerve followed, and later there was wasting of the muscles supplied by this nerve together with ansthesia over the area supplied by it. Similar nerve symptoms then occurred on the opposite side, and the patient suffered from pain in the region of the heart. He was under treatment for some time, and the symptoms all disappeared. Shooting pains in the course of the ulnar nerves recurred during some months, but eventually disappeared again and he remained quite well. At no time did any discoloured ansthetic patches occur on the body, and the ansthesia and wasting were confined to the distribution of the ulnar nerve. This history clearly points to a neuritis set up by septic infection, which subsided under treatment. Yet the case when it first occurred was quoted as an example of the inoculability of leprosy. (4)  Calicut.-The patient had been a sweeper at the asylum for twenty- three years. In this capacity he also had to dress the worst ulcers. He used
?Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             275 to mix freely with the lepers and eat what they left. According to his own assertions he was quite well twenty-three years ago and developed leprosy only two years ago. He belonged to Calicut and was of a very low caste. His father was not a leper, and this was confirmed by the cook of the asylum, who had resided there for thirty years. The father had been a sweeper for six years, his son succeeding him on his death. The patient's mother, and his six brothers and sisters, were all healthy. An old inmate of the asylum, on the other hand, asserted that the sweeper had suffered from leprosy for at least six years, but was apparently healthy twenty years ago. This case is the only one quoted in support of contagion which has not utterly broken down, and whatever value it possesses in the way of positive evidence must be conceded. (5) Madras.-The cook of the asylum had been employed for fifteen years, and was suffering from incipient leprosy. He had a discoloured and ansthetic patch over the right knee, and a similar patch on the right side of his face. He asserted that these changes were of six months' standing, and denied all family history of leprosy. On making enquiries of an old patient (an intelligent Eurasian and a pupil teacher), it was found that the patch in the face existed before the cook came to the asylum; moreover, at that time he attended as an out-patient and was treated with gurjun oil. Without the knowledge of the patient his brother was interrogated, and he assured the Commissioners that the patch on the face had existed over fifteen years, and that their mother, another brother, and one of the sister's sons also were lepers. This witness had always considered his brother to be a leper. It is quite clear that this case is valueless as an instance of contagion. (6) Tanjore.-A Hindu, aged 45, who had suffered from leprosy for ten years, stated that his wife had lately become a leper. He had constantly lived with her. The Commission visited the latter at her house and found on exa- mination that she complained of a feeling in the soles of her feet as though she were walking on wool. She had no ansthesia or patches, and was cer- tainly not a leper. (7) Trichinopoly.-A patient in the asylum stated that he suffered from a skin eruption eleven years ago. He wished to be admitted into the asylum as a patient, but admission was refused as the disease was too slight. He was employed as a ward cooly, and used to dress the lepers' ulcers. He contra- dicted himself as to dates, but was certain that the disease appeared after he joined the asylum. On referring to the records of the asylum it was found that the patient "was admitted as a leper on the 25th of March, 1880, and discharged on the 17th May, 1880," when he was said to be cured. Further it was found in the letter book of the asylum that the patient commenced his duties as ward cooly T 2
276               REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: in July, 1882, during the absence on leave of the former ward cooly. This man, who happened to be in Trichinopoly, was questioned separately and without his having had any communication with the patient. He stated that when he returned from leave he threw up the appointment, and the patient was confirmed in it. Three years later the leprosy became more marked, and he was placed on the asylum register as a patient. In this case the statement of the patient, that he contracted leprosy after he became an attendant at the asylum, was clearly disproved by the evidence of the asylum records and that of his predecessor in office. The above eight examples illustrate very clearly the class of cases usually adduced to prove the contagiousness of leprosy. The cases at Madras, Agra, Trombay, Calicut, and Trichinopoly all relate to persons employed, at one time or other, in the asylums. At Ajodhya and Tanjore the evidence offered is that of husband and wife, while at Bombay the case quoted is that of a student who accidentally infected himself during an autopsy on a leper. For the details of the last case the Com- missioners are indebted to Surgeon-Major Hatch of Bombay. The case was published when it first occurred, and was widely quoted as an example of the inoculability of leprosy.17 The first symptoms, indeed, were very suspicious, but the Commis- sion are of opinion that the further progress of the case, as related by Dr. Hatch, entirely negatived the original diagnosis of leprosy. Besides, it is well known that infective processes are not unfrequently followed by peripheral and central nervous changes. In the two cases in which the wife was supposed to have contracted leprosy from the husband, an examination showed that the woman was not a leper at all, while in four out of five cases in which asylum attendants were supposed to have been infected by the inmates, the former were shown to have been lepers before they entered on their duties. Thus the Calicut case alone remains. But the statement of the patient himself and that of the old inmate of the asylum (17) Lancet, May 17, 1890, page 1064.
Contagiousness of Leprosy. 277 are considerably at variance as to dates. And it must always be remembered that in a country like India, where leprosy is endemic, it is quite possible that the patient may have acquired the disease from some source other than the asylum : in other words, that the case may have been merely a coincidence.

In the construction of this table only those cases have been chosen where it was stated that the members of the
Contagiousness of Leprosy. 279 respective families lived together. In many instances no special notice had been taken of this fact, and all these have been disregarded unless a case of leprosy occurred amongst the children. Now, no doubt, as in many of the cases left out on account of insufficient details there has been no separation or segregation of the leper, this table will over-rate the chances of a possible contagion rather than under-estimate it. It will be seen that about 5 per cent. of the persons living in daily intercourse with lepers under the same roof at one time or other developed the disease. A number of children have been left out of consideration because they died as infants or while very young. This has been done in order to give the argu- ment in favour of contagion every possible advantage, for surely, where contagion as such is discussed, age need hardly be consi- dered. If a disease be contagious it should be so at any age. But if it is necessary to assume a long incubation period, as many writers do, which sometimes extends through infancy and child- hood, until what is called the probable age of attack is reached, this is surely an unjustifiable extension of the term contagion, or a practical denial of the influence of contagion by a reduction to an absurdity. Again, in some cases entered in the table, the diagnosis of leprosy was extremely doubtful, and in one case the child contracted the disease at the same time as the father. Thus by allowing the validity of these cases a further advantage is allowed to the hypothesis of contagion. And yet in only 5 per cent. of the cases could a possible influence be assumed. But the ratio obtained from this table of course cannot be taken to represent the actually existing chances of infection. For from among the total community coming into contact with lepers, only a few have been selected. Moreover all other causes, such as endemicity, or a de novo origin of the disease, have been altogether disregarded. However, assuming, for argument's sake, that all the above cases are genuine instances of contagion, and that the spread of leprosy depends on this
280 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: alone, a little reflection will show that, selecting such a com- munity as is implied in the tables, the disease would die out after a few generations. Has this not been entirely confirmed by the history of theNorwegian emigrants? In the chapter on hereditary transmission and predisposition it was seen that the disease has a predilection for certain fami- lies. It was further shown that heredity cannot justly be consi- dered the cause thereof. It may be asked, whether this fact be not explicable on the theory of the contagiousness of leprosy. From a casual inspection of Tables IX, X, Xa, and Xb of Chapter IV, it might appear as though this were really so. Fur- ther consideration will prove, that even assuming the spread of leprosy within a family to be due to contagion, yet the danger of a general increase of the disease throughout the country on this account is exceedingly slight. Firstly, amongst all the families of which one member at least was a leper, in only from 5 to 8 per cent. at the most can the disease be said to have spread within the family. Secondly, this diffusion within the family is very slight. For as Table II of this chapter shows, of 1,691 persons who came into close contact with lepers, only 95, or about 5 per cent., became affected. Comparing Table I of Chapter IV with the present table, there seems at first sight to be a great discrepancy. From the former it might appear that in 264 out of 2,371 families, or in 11.1 per cent., the disease had attacked more than one member, that is, spread more or less within the family; while according to the latter only 95 out of 1,691 individuals living with a leper in a family became affected. The difference in the figures is due to the fact that in the enquiry into an here- ditary taint, the evidence afforded by the patient's immediate ancestors naturally was fully considered, as well as that afford- ed by his own children, while for the construction of Table II of this chapter, only the latter and the history of husbands or wives were taken into account. If the tables had been constructed on equal lines, no doubt many more instances of
?Contagiousness of Leprosy. 281 an assumed contagion might have been added. But, on the other hand, a far greater number of cases would have been found where such a possible infection could not be claimed. For there are many instances where a leper confessed to having lived with his parents and brothers and sisters without infecting them. Again, in a discussion of heredity it makes no difference whether the leprous ancestor was separated from his family or not. In Table I of Chapter IV, therefore, all the cases have been considered where the children had been removed from their parents, or developed the disease many years after their death. Finally, of the 264 lepers with an hereditary history, several were members of the same families, so that if the table is to be used as an argument for a spread by contagion within a family, evidently certain deductions will have to be made. Making every allowance for these differences in the con- struction of the tables, it is evident that the discrepancy is only apparent. Table I of Chapter IV, therefore, as it stands cannot be applied to prove or disprove contagion. It can only show, that taking all the families in which one individual at least is a leper, in considerably less than 11.1 per cent. another mem- ber of the same family becomes affected. To apply it to the subject under discussion, all instances in which contagion can be positively excluded must be omitted and each family taken as a whole. As the cases mentioned in Tables IX and X of the same chapter are comprised in Table I no further comment is necessary regarding them. The deductions from Table Xa are strong arguments in favour of the views expressed in this chapter, while the cases selected for the construction of Table Xb are too special to permit any general conclusions being drawn from them. The discrepancies are, therefore, only on the surface. To study the possible influence of contagion within a family, all the members of such family must be considered-wives and
?282 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: husbands as well as children-and it must be demanded that the individuals had actually exposed themselves to the risk of infection' by intercourse with lepers, that is,-separation and segregation must be absolutely excluded. All these conditions  have been fulfilled in Table II of this chapter. TABLE III. To show in how many Cases a Supposed Contagion can be traced from Husband to Wife, or vice versa.

Or, expressing it in other words, 381 healthy persons lived intimately with an equal number of individuals, exposing themselves to all possible risk of contagion, and of this number only 25 subsequently became
284 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: affected, or 6.5 per cent. Six of these cases may fairly be subtracted, so that of 381 people living with an equal number of lepers only 19, or 4.9 per cent., became diseased, accepting the doubtful cases, two in number, as trustworthy. Only those cases have been chosen where couples had been married for at least five years, the average time being from seven to ten years. There can be no doubt that an en- quiry into the condition of people married to lepers is the best mode of ascertaining how far contagion influences the diffusion of the disease. As Drs. Lewis and Cunningham said in their report:18 "The means which most naturally suggests itself for enquiring into the theory that leprosy is a contagious disease is an examination of the history of all the married lepers, for were the result of this to show that the wives or husbands, as the case might be, of lepers suffer frequently from the disease this would be some evidence in favour of contagion." From the above table it will be seen, that even allowing a long incubation period, the ratio of people affected is too small to warrant a belief in contagion as a factor of much importance. If it be remembered that the married people lived in endemic areas, the possibility of a de novo de- velopment of the disease must undoubtedly exist. In Table II the evidence afforded by whole families is given, and it is at once seen that these two tables correspond in every respect. However, do instances of a possible contagion exist amongst people who have been married to lepers for less than five years ? There were only five such cases, two at Bombay, two at Madras, where each individual after having lived with a leper husband for three years developed the disease, and one at Tanjore. Here two people had been married for sixteen years, and then the husband became a leper and was left by his wife, who, within six months, was said likewise to have been attacked by the disease. The woman could not be examined, (18) Op. cit., page 56.
Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             285 and the diagnosis was highly questionable. But even allowing the latter to be correct, it would seem probable that this is not an instance of contagion, but that in these two people the disease was the effect of the same causes. A table will now be added, giving the number of people who have been married to lepers, and who have lived with them for less than five years, for periods varying from six months to four years, three years being the average, since the manifes- tation of the disease, and stating in how many instances leprosy occurred.

The Tanjore case can perhaps hardly be included, so that the ratio would be reduced to .9 per cent. It may be assumed that a certain number will at a future date become affected. But in any case the two Tables III and IIIa taken together are strong arguments against an amount of contagion worthy of serious
?Contagiousness of Leprosy.                             287 practical consideration, as they plainly show that husbands or wives of lepers do not frequently suffer from the disease. The fact that in Table III a greater percentage of husbands or wives became affected may be explained in other ways than by mere prolonged contact with lepers. For it must not be for- gotten that in almost every instance, at the time of marriage both individuals were healthy, and that subsequently one of them became affected, that is, all these people must presum- ably have lived under conditions favourable to the appearance of the disease. The further facts that they all have lived in endemic districts, and that leprosy is a highly chronic disease, make it less surprising to find a higher ratio of lepers in Table III. TABLE IV.

Including the doubtful case a possible contagion can be traced in only 3 per cent., a fact which, even on the assumption that some of the attendants may subsequently develop leprosy, nevertheless gives little support to the view that leprosy is spread by contagion. TABLE IVb. Enumeration of Instances where Persons other than Officials resided in the Asylums with Lepers. (1) Almora.-In the asylum there were eleven people, blind, lame, and imbecile. Of these, two inmates, aged forty and forty-five years, respectively, had been there for twenty-eight years. Two, aged sixty and forty, had lived there for eight years, and another, aged forty, for seventeen years. The other
?Contagiousness of Leprosy. 291 six had resided at the asylum severally for eleven, five, three, three, two, and one year. All these were examined by the Commissioners and found to be free from leprosy. (2) Calcutta.-Here there were two cases. (a) A Native Christian, seventy years old, who has been in the asylum twenty-five years, lives in a ward with lepers. He eats and drinks with them and often consumes what they have left, or what they give him. He drinks out of the same vessels and smokes the same hookah. He was found to be suffering from multiple molluscum fibrosum, but otherwise quite healthy. He will not leave the asylum, as he finds it comfortable. (b) A woman, who suffers from hysteria and eczema, has been in the asylum for twelve to thirteen years in close contact with four leper inmates She is quite free from leprosy. (3) Lucknow.-(a) A man and his mistress were admitted on July 7th, 1876. He was a leper, she was healthy and lived in the poor-house with him and the other inmates until June 9th, 1881, when he died. Their child is now twelve years old. He and his mother remained in the poor-house with the lepers, so that she has been there fifteen years and- (b) her boy, twelve years. Both are quite healthy. (c) A woman was admitted July 5th, 1878, under the supposition that she suffered from leprosy. She married a leper in the poor-house, but had no issue. A son of a former marriage, sixteen years of age, came to Lucknow and has remained there with her, so that she and- (d) her son have lived amongst lepers for thirteen years without becoming tainted by the disease. (4) Madras.-A boy, an Eurasian, seventeen years of age, had been in the leper asylum for two years. He was admitted on account of a wrong diagnosis and was very reluctant to leave. He was quite healthy. (5) Subathu.-(a) A man, who up to the present time is free from the disease, has lived at the asylum for seven years, sharing a room with a leper, and eating and drinking with him. (b) A woman, whose husband was a leper and died at Subathu, has lived there for eight to nine years. She is quite healthy and has remained at the asylum to help the female lepers. (c) Another woman was admitted from motives of charity, and has lived among the lepers for ten years, being at present free from the disease. (d) A third woman has voluntarily lived among the lepers for three- to four years, and has remained healthy. (6) Tarn Taran.-(a) A woman married a leper at the asylum and lived there for ten years. They had two children. She and - (b and c) her two children are healthy. (d) A drover's wife, after her husband's death, had frequent intercourse with the lepers of the asylum for the last twelve years, giving birth to three children.

Adding these thirty-five cases to the previous sixty-nine cases of Table IVa, it will be seen that of one hundred and four persons, living under conditions highly favour- able for contracting a communicable disease, only one, or possibly two, have become lepers ; that is, 1 or 2 per cent.

Thayetmyo  10 16 5 In one case the disease appeared in two people at the same time, and, therefore, one cannot be said to have infected the other. In another case the diagnosis of leprosy in the supposed infected person was extremely doubtful, and in third instance two persons eating together developed the disease within year of each other. TOTAL 86 212 21  For the construction of this table, only the information obtained from asylums and districts in which the Commissioners paid special attention to this point, has been considered. In all the cases, with the exception of those in Gya, families used to eat at the same time, and out of the same vessels. Since at Gya the wives previously washed the dishes from which their leper husbands had eaten, these seven cases must be excluded in calculating the possible influence of contagion. Hence the figures show that of two hundred and five persons who exposed themselves by eating and drinking with lepers to the danger of infection, only twenty-one became affected. Moreover, in the one instance where two individuals who had constantly eaten together from the same vessels became diseased at the same time, there can be no question of contagion. Again, cases of persons who had not come into contact with lepers for long period cannot be quoted in favour of contagion. Five such instances are to be found in Table V, one from Agra, one from Aligarh, one from Benares, one from Calcutta, and one from Mandalay. The assumption of so long an incubation period as
296 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: five years or more means practically reducing the influence of contagion to an absurdity. Six cases, therefore, must be sub- tracted from the twenty-one instances of possible contagion through eating and drinking with lepers. Besides, in one case (Thayetmyo), the diagnosis was extremely doubtful, and in two cases (Calcutta and Thayetmyo), the disease may be said to have commenced in the two persons at the same time, as they were affected within a year of each other. It is also very questionable whether one of the cases recorded from Prome can be cited with all fairness as an example of possible con- tagion from these causes. Allowing, however, that these cases are free from objection, the figures show that of two hundred and five persons who exposed themselves to the risk of con- tagion by eating and drinking with lepers, fifteen might be claimed as exemplifying an assumed influence of contagion, or 7.3 per cent. These figures cannot be said to favour the hypothesis of an infection through eating and drinking with lepers, especially when it is remembered that 7.3 per cent. is probably considerably above the actual ratio, which perhaps is more nearly represented by 5 per cent., even assuming that the spread of the disease among these people depends on conta- gion only.

?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 299 CHAPTER VI. Sanitation, Diet, and Diseases in relation to Leprosy. Sanitation. IT has been seen that heredity and contagion are altogether insufficient to explain the spread of leprosy, and other tiological factors must be sought for. In diseases like le- prosy and tuberculosis, it is always difficult to find the ex- citing cause. For, with the recognition that a specific bacillus enters the body, the matter is but little advanced. The en- quirer must always ask, why a widely diffused microbe, such as that of tuberculosis or leprosy, should cause a particular dis- ease in some people and not in others. What is it that estab- lishes the necessary specific predisposition ? This question is as obscure for leprosy as it is for tubercu- losis. In this chapter the more important causes, supposed to bring about such specific predisposition, will be discussed. When a disease, as is the case with leprosy, is so generally distributed over a vast country, attention must be directed to the general life and hygienic surroundings of the people. Does defective sanitation cause a specific predisposition to leprosy? Since all classes of the community and all races appear to be subject to leprosy, remarks upon the sanitary environ- ment of the inhabitants of India must be necessarily gene- ral in character. In the cities and larger centres of population considerable progress has of late years been made in sanitary improvement, though very much yet remains to be done. In the smaller towns and villages, however, little has been ac- complished, or, indeed, is practicable in the present state of native opinion. Fortunately the nature of the employment of the great mass of the population necessitates an outdoor
300 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: life, and the free air-flushing of the village site, and the rapid desiccation of the objectionable matters thrown upon it, go far to reduce the consequences of habitual neglect of sanitary principles. These matters will now be dealt with in detail. As regards conservancy, it is found that the cities and larger towns are provided with suitable latrines, which are in charge of an ade- quate conservancy staff, and which are largely used by the people. The excreta from these latrines, and also the general refuse and rubbish of the town, are regularly removed to a distance, and there buried, burnt, or otherwise suitably dis- posed of. Although differences exist in various localities as regards the efficiency of these arrangements, they may be described as upon the whole fairly good. But no large centre of population is free from many nuisances. Ruined huts and waste pieces of land are frequently used for purposes of nature, cesspools exist in many courtyards and in immediate proximity to wells, excavations full of fetid water are frequently observed, and other sources of danger to the public health are only too common. In the smaller towns and villages little or no attempt at organising conservancy arrangements is made. The villager deposits the refuse and sweepings of the dwelling in the imme- diate vicinity of the house or hut, in some cases from in- difference, in others to avoid theft of such matters before their employment for agricultural operations. For purposes of nature he generally resorts to a field in the neighbourhood, or to the banks of a stream or pond. Refuse water is allowed usually to flow from his hut into the adjacent road. It should be no- ted, however, that despite the frequently objectionable nature of its surroundings, the interior of the average village dwelling is usually fairly clean. Most cities and towns have a more or less satisfactory system of drainage as regards the main thoroughfares, but the climatic conditions of the country, and the fact that so many
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 301 months of the year are almost rainless, render the flushing of these water-ways a matter of extreme difficulty, and often an impossibility. Where the configuration of the land permits, attempts are often made to utilize streams and other sources of water for the purpose, but a glance at a physical map of India will show how in the extensive flat plains of the country no such procedure is possible. Again, although much has been, and is being, done to ensure efficient drainage of in- habited sites, such efforts have up to the present time been more especially directed to the carrying off of water from the thoroughfares and streets. Small drains, it is true, connect the dwellings with the larger channels, but inasmuch as the inhabitants bathe at the public wells and tanks, and practically only employ such water in their houses as is required for drinking and cooking, little or no flow in these connecting drains is usually observable. Few towns as yet in India pos- sess a water-supply laid on in pipes to the houses. In the villages and smaller centres of population water finds its way more or less completely from the site through small cuttings in the soil, or through a channel created natur- ally by the heavy rainfall during the monsoon. As regards water-supply, some of the larger towns and cities, as Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Agra, and certain others, are provided with a good supply laid on in pipes. But the great majority of places have no such arrangements, and here the water is taken from wells, rivers, springs, tanks, or lakes. From both wells and rivers the water is usually more or less impure, though superior to that from lakes and tanks. Spring water when obtainable is, as might be expected, usually good. Attempts to sink Artesian wells have succeeded in a few locali- ties, but have more generally failed. Local authorities in the larger centres have of late years succeeded in improving the supply by such measures as keeping in repair the wells that hold good water and closing those of which the contents are impure, by remodelling tanks and preventing their pollution,
?302 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: but in the villages little at. present can be done in this direc- tion. Habitations necessarily vary in size with the wealth and position of the owner or tenant. They are more generally built of bricks and mud in the plains, of stone in the hill tracts, and of bamboo and wood in Burma and certain parts of India. In towns and cities they are usually placed in close proximity to one another, and thereby efficient ventilation and air-flushing of the site are interfered with. Overcrowding of these dwellings is the rule, and in the hill tracts is often excessive. The residents, however, live largely in the open air, and doors and windows are either seldom closed, or are so carelessly con- structed that air freely enters the house or hut. In connection with habitations, it should be mentioned that not only in India but also in other parts of the world the mosquito has been much feared. As Dr. Arning says:1 " Ashmead seems to fear much the bite of the mosquito, and I quite agree with him that the idea of transmission of leprosy through the sting of an insect is a very plausible one." Dr. Arning himself "frequently examined mosquitoes bacterio- scopically, which were found inside the mosquito nets of beds containing cases of severe cutaneous leprosy. He caught the insects when they were quite full of the blood sucked from the patients. He never discovered any trace of leprosy bacilli, either in or upon them." Some members of the Commission examined flies and mosquitoes, but also with negative result, as will be seen from the Laboratory Report. Other consider- ations, however, make it appear extremely unlikely that a propagation of the disease should be due to these insects. It is hardly possible that the toxic principle of the mosquito should contain bacilli, even though they be present in the blood with which the insect is gorged. Again, cases of transmission from patients to hospital or asylum officials should be very common (1) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No 2, February 1891. page 132.
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 303 if this theory be true. Yet in Calcutta, where mosquitoes and flies abound, no instance of a transmission of the disease from a leper to a healthy individual has ever occurred at the asylum. All over the plains these insects are common, and nevertheless, with the exception of a single case in Calicut, no instance of infection could be found, even amongst the people who volun- tarily resided with the lepers in the asylums. In fact it may be said that the whole chapter on contagion lends no support to the insect theory. Personal cleanliness in India is very much a matter of cli- mate. Where this is warm or mild all classes bathe frequently, Hindus more especially. In such localities linen and cotton clothes are worn and are regularly washed. But in colder latitudes far less attention is paid to regular ablutions, and where the climate demands the use of woollen clothing, such garments are seldom washed and become extremely foul. In the hill tracts the people may be said to rarely bathe, and are, as a rule, extremely dirty in their persons and habits. Most people possess shoes, but they are as often as not discarded, the owner walking for preference barefoot. Scabies is very common all over India, and it has been asked whether or no this may contribute to the spread of the disease. This assumption may be refuted by the arguments used against the theory of propagation by insects, and it will not be necessary to enter into this question any further. It may be mentioned, however, that itch pustules were examined for the bacillus in several instances, but always with negative result. It is quite impossible to assume that defective hygiene, whether general or personal, alone would originate leprosy. For, as will be seen from the above short review, the hygienic conditions vary considerably even in leprous areas, and the disease capriciously spares certain portions of a country where the condition of the population is identical with that of those attacked. In India the disease is found in the richest and
?304 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: poorest provinces. Defective hygiene, exposure to hardships and privations, filthy dwellings and want of personal cleanliness cannot be said to predispose to leprosy more than to any other disease of like nature. They necessarily must aggravate and accelerate it, when it is once established; and for this reason, where they exist, require improvement.2 Diet. The next question to be considered is the important one of diet. Since the earliest days in the history of leprosy the greatest influence in the aetiology of the disease has been attributed to defective or bad dietetic conditions. In turn al- most every foodstuff has been accused. In ancient medical history the eating of certain kinds of fish, fresh or decayed, was considered of great importance, and this opinion has per- sisted to the present day. Too much or too little animal or vegetable food has also been held responsible for the origin of the disease, or specific predisposition to the same. This influence of diet was naturally as keenly disputed by others. That food should have a specific effect in the tiology of a chronic disease is  priori quite within the bounds of pos- sibility. No one who believes in the infective nature of leprosy would of course assume food to be a final exciting cause, for it is implied in the term "infective disease" that this must be a parasitic organism. It must be remembered, however, that when these various food-theories were propounded, the bacillus had not been discovered, and that, therefore, the views of many of the older authors would not be misrepresented, by stating that they claimed for diet only a direct effect in the establishment of a specific predisposition. Certain forms of diet are capable of producing grave morbid conditions, as, e.g., Lathyrus sativus and Ergot; others, on the other hand, cause more general changes in the (2) Cf. R. Liveing: op. cit., pages 76 and 77.
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 305 body, and may thus possibly lead to those conditions which establish a specific predisposition.3 In fact the experiments of H. Leo 4 lend much support to such a theory. " He admin- istered phloridzin in small doses along with food to white mice for some days previous to inoculation, with the result that sugar became present in the tissues of the experimental animal. He found that the animals which are normally but little susceptible to glanders infection became highly suscepti- ble to it, if previously dosed with phloridzin." In connection with this subject, it may also be mentioned, that Charrin and Roger5 have shown "that ordinary normal rats, which, as is well known, are very little susceptible to anthrax, become susceptible to this disease in a marked degree if they are, when caged, made to work a treadmill so as to become tho- roughly fatigued." Food must necessarily modify the constitution of the tissues and may do so in such a way as to prepare them to respond at once to the introduction of microbes against which they would otherwise have proved refractory or insusceptible. Thus Monti6 has shown that by a separate injection of a sufficient quantity of the chemical products of the Proteus vulgaris into rabbits, mice or other rodents, these animals could easily be made to succumb to an infection with cultures of the Diploc- occus pneumoni, which through repeated subculture or age had lost their virulence, and which without the chemical products of the saprophyte were also entirely harmless. As Dr. E. Klein,7 who confirmed and extended Monti's experi- ments, says, " insusceptibility of the tissues is, as is well known, (3) R. Liveing: op. cit., page 83. (4) H. Leo: Zeitschrift fr Hygiene VII., 3; and Nineteenth Annual Report of the Local Government Board; Supplement, 1889, page 217.

?306 Report of the Leprosy Commission: considered by some authorities to be connected with, if not wholly dependent on, the chemical nature of the tissues; so that while the tissues are normal or in full vigour (if the phrase may be allowed for the purpose of illustrating my meaning), a particular microbe getting access to them fails to thrive-cannot, so to speak, overcome the resistance or inimical action offered by the tissues. This power of resistance of tissues can, however, be greatly reduced or even abolished by certain means, such as depression of their vitality either due to ptomaines and certain other chemical substances which have invaded them, or to nervous exhaustion, and the like." Where food is considered of tiological importance in the production of an infective disease, there are, broadly speaking, two ways in which it may cause the latter. " First, by a direct introduction of the bacillus into the alimentary tract; secondly, by causing changes in the tissues capable of rousing into activity a bacillus already existing in them,"8 or of offering a suitable soil to a bacillus subsequently introduced into them. These points will be kept in view in the following discussion. At the present moment three substances have been specially singled out as having a causal relation to leprosy, viz., fish, salt, and water. However, before discussing the effect of food in general, and of these three articles in particular, a few remarks on the diets of the Indian community must be made. The inhabitants of India are almost entirely vegetarians, and the majority of people do not touch flesh from one year's end to another. Muhammadans, it is true, make flesh, other than that of the pig, a regular article of diet, but expense usually prevents its extensive consumption, and it is used generally in small quantities to supplement the main vegetable elements of their food. Hindus are vegetarians, but certain (8) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 1, August 1890, page 77.
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 307 of the lower classes will readily eat meat, and Chamars will even consume the flesh of animals which have died of disease. Rajputs, especially in Central India, and wild forest tribes, eat what flesh may be killed in the chase, though some of pure Hindu blood refuse that of deer and pigs. Fowls and eggs are readily eaten in some parts of the country, but are regarded with abhorrence in others. Milk, curds, "ghee," or clarified butter are universally consumed. As above stated, the great majority of inhabitants are ve- getarians and live upon the crops raised in the country, the coarser grains being used by the poorer, and the finer by the richer, classes of the community. The subjoined table and remarks taken from the Report of the Famine Commission in 1880 will show the distribution and consumption of the various staples.   PROVINCE.

In Bengal proper and Orissa, and the eastern portion of Central India (and in Burma) rice is the principal food,the coarse early rice being mainly taken by the poor, the x 2
?308 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: finer late rice by the rich. In the South, or Mahratta-speak- ing part of the Central Provinces, in Berar, in Bombay, the Deccan, and the northern part of Madras, the two large millets -jowar and bajra-form the principal food, the Brahmins usu- ally living on imported rice and wheat. In Mysore the ordi- nary food is the small millet (ragi). In the southern part of Madras and the western districts of Bombay rice is chiefly consumed, though there is a good deal of millet grown and eaten." All classes mix pulses with their food in order to ob- tain the necessary nitrogenous elements. Maize,though grown more or less everywhere, is not so largely consumed as might have been expected. Vegetables, such as spinach, pumpkins, carrots, potatoes, and useful wild herbs are largely used, and condiments, such as chillies, are taken with the meal to assist digestion. Fruit, such as that of the mhowa, mango, plantain, and cocoanut are eaten when obtainable, and oil and salt form part of every dietary. Both sea and fresh-water fish are largely consumed wherever they can be caught. Dried fish is used all round the coast, especially in the Madras Presidency and Burma. In the latter country "nga-pi" or dried fish, more or less in a state of decomposition,is almost universally eaten, but in small quanti- ties and more as a condiment than as a food. It would be a mistake to suppose that the consumption of fish in India is in any degree confined to the coast or the vicinity of large rivers. Nearly every tank, pond, lake, or rivu- let holds species which are caught and eaten. In many parts of India this forms a portion of the dietary of even the higher castes. Food in India is usually eaten out of metal or earthen vessels, or platters made of dried leaves, the consumer sitting on the ground, or upon a mat, and using the fingers in place of knives and forks. Among Hindus it is customary for the males to eat before the females. Flesh is roasted, stewed, or boiled, pulses are usually boiled, and grain is either parched, or far
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 309 more frequently ground, and the flour made into unleavened cakes known as "chupatties." Rice is boiled and either eaten alone or in the form of curries. As already stated, cooked vegetables, salt, oil, and condiments form portions of almost every dietary. Sugar, sweetmeats and fruits are also largely consumed. Of all articles of diet none has been held more responsible for the causation of leprosy than fish. This view has of late years gained considerable importance through the weight of the authority of Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson who stated the fish hypothesis with great force at the Tenth International Medical Congress at Berlin.9 As Virchow and Dr. Liveing have pointed out, the theory is very old and has reappeared from time to time. Virchow's views on the subject have not infrequently been misrepresented, and it may, therefore, not be out of place here to quote his own words:10 "The more general use of bad fish very (ungewhnlich) frequently coincides with endemic leprosy. This statement, however, is subject to exceptions, but then, as a rule, another noxious dietetic article is accused, and comparative observations might be made as to whether or no the same deleterious substance exists in fish and these other articles of food." It will not be necessary to say more about the history of the fish hypothesis, as this has been done so concisely by Dr. Liveing in his Goulstonian lectures. One passage, however, of special interest with regard to leprosy in India is worthy of notice. Dr. Liveing says 11: "The com- bination, however, of milk and fish seems to have been consid- ered especially favourable to the disease. Bernhard Gordon says: 'Comedere lac et pisces in eadem mensa inducit Lepram.' And it is not a little remarkable that the same opinion obtains in the present day in India." There is no doubt that in certain (9) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 1, August 1890, pages 77-87. (10) R. Virchow: op. cit., page 507. (11) R. Liveing: op. cit., page 33 and footnote, page 34.
?310 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: parts of the empire this opinion is very prevalent, especially in Kashmir and the hill districts. Lepers in India also frequently assert that after a fish meal their state is exacerbated. Coming now to the discussion of the fish hypothesis and its application to Indian leprosy, it will be best to take it in its two chief parts. Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson says12: "It is possible that fish may cause the disease in one of several ways. First, it may be by the direct introduction of the bacillus into the stomach; secondly, it may be that some element in fish- food rouses into activity a bacillus already existing in the tissues." Taking the first point, it should be possible to find the bacillus not infrequently in fish caught in endemic areas.  priori, judging from the similarity between leprosy and tuber- culosis, it would not seem impossible that the Bacillus lepr is capable of growing in a cold-blooded animal. The Commis- sion paid special attention to this point, and some members examined a large number of fish, fresh and dried, or prepared as "nga-pi," but with absolutely negative result. Dr. Arning, who has studied this part of the question most carefully, has also never been able to find any leprosy bacilli in fish. The value of such investigations is necessarily that of negative evidence, but until positive cases have been shown, is worthy of all consideration. The fish hypothesis premises that all lepers at one time or another have eaten fish in some form. Perhaps India is the most suitable country to investigate this matter, for here people of all castes and religions are thrown together. There is no reasonable doubt whatever that the majority of Brahmins never touch flesh or fish, and the same applies to many of the Banias or traders in certain districts, and almost without exception to the Jains. There are many Brahmins, however, settled on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, who habitually eat fish, and it is (12) Loc. cit.
Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc.                       311 not at all rare to find Brahmins in hill districts and also in the plains who do not refuse fish. But in the plains they are much stricter in this respect. Jains, however, under no circumstances touch any animal food. They are, in fact, so particular, that it is a custom amongst many of them to fasten a piece of cloth to the upper lip to avoid inhaling small insects. They will not eat or drink in the dark, and always strain water through a cloth before drinking. Their priests have a broom with which they sweep the road before them to avoid the supposed guilt of killing insects by treading them under foot. This is a regular custom among the Bhabras in the Hoshiarpur District.13 Now leprosy occurs amongst all these classes, and it seems indeed that the disease is impartially distributed among the fish-eating and non-fish-eating communities. It is only possible to talk of strong impressions, as accurate statistics and relative numbers cannot be drawn up, partly on account of the uncertainty of the present state of many castes and the changes which inter- course with Europeans has brought about. For instance, "among the lower ranks of Brahmins, great latitude is taken in regard to labour, food, etc., and their claim to the distinction of that caste is, in consequence, little recognised."14 On the other hand, the conditions in which the better castes live are so different from those of the lower, which undoubtedly supply, not only absolutely, but also relatively, the greater number of lepers, that comparisons would be unfair. The Banias or traders, of whatever caste or religion, for instance, are, generally speaking, a wealthy class, and the disease is acknowledged to be less common among prosperous people, though it does not spare them altogether. Now among the mixed class of Banias are many castes, the laws of which forbid the consumption of meat in any form. Many of the Banias in certain parts of India are attached to the Jain religion. In fact, it is a singular (13) Gazetteer of the Hoshiarpur District, 1883-84, page 46. (14) Lewis and Cunningham; op. cit., page 61, footnote.
312 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: circumstance that many of them are devoted to this or some other modification of the Buddhist faith. When, therefore, a Bania or Brahmin leper denies ever having eaten fish, it is at least possible from what is known of the habits and customs of these communities. This is especially true of Agra and the North-West Provinces, so far as the Banias are concerned.15 The Jains form one of the richest communities in India, yet the disease, though rarely, is found amongst them. Thus, at Hoshiarpur two of the Commissioners gathered, through the kindness of the Civil Surgeon Dr. Datta, reliable information concerning a leper from the Bhabra class, in whose case the cause of the disease could certainly not be ascribed to fish- eating. It is not claimed that the fact of a man calling himself a Brahmin or a Bania is identical with saying that he has never eaten fish. It has already been said that many of the former consume animal food, and the latter include amongst their numbers many castes whose laws do not prohibit such a diet. This short exposition is meant to show that many of these people do never touch fish, and that, therefore, if a leper belonging to either class denies ever having done so, there is a fair probability of his statement being true. Now Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson16 objects and says: "In recording the denial on the part of leprosy patients that they have been fish consumers, caution must be exercised. Those who belong to castes which are forbidden to eat animal food will naturally be prone to deny that they have deviated from the rule. The temptation to eat fish as a condiment must, in the case of those restricted to an exclusively vegetable diet, be very great. It is, under those circumstances, precisely those who eat it most seldom (dwellers far inland, for instance) who are likely to receive it in its most dangerous state of decom- (15) M. A. Sherring : Hindu Tribes and Castes, 1872, pages 285-299. (16) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 1, August 1890, page 79.
Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 313 position. It must always be remembered that members of castes forbidden to take life often eagerly avail themselves of all opportunities as regards what has been found dead or killed by others. Thus the bare statement that leprosy prevails in classes who, from religious scruples, never eat animal food is usually of no real value. Careful and even sceptical inquiry must be made as to whether the individual lepers had really, in the case of preserved fish, invariably abstained." There is of course much truth in these assertions of Mr. Hutchinson, and the above facts have only been mentioned to show that it is possible to find amongst lepers, individuals belonging to castes not allowed to touch animal food. Now Mr. Hutchinson is inclined to doubt the statement of lepers who profess to observe the rules which caste or religion enforce on them. Yet if a comparatively large number of lepers are found who state that they have never eaten fish, and these belong to castes or tribes of which it is known that their rules forbid the strict observer to touch meat or flesh in any form or shape, it seems improbable that all of them should have deceived the questioner or themselves. The Commission paid particular attention to this question, and found that one hundred and sixty-two individuals denied ever having touched fish (Table I). Many of these were allowed to partake of animal food, but denied ever having eaten fish, though in all cases leading questions were avoided as much as possible. To see in what percentage of cases an abstinence from this article of diet could be traced, every leper of a certain number of asylums was interrogated, with the result that out of 464 lepers 99, or 21.3 per cent., denied having ever partaken of fish.

The leper asylums of Almora and Dehra Dun are occupied by residents of the Himalayan hill tracts of Kumaun and Garhwal. The great elevations at which many of the villages in these tracts are situated, and their remoteness from rivers and streams, make fish a very rare article of food among the people. Some indeed have never seen it. A careful enquiry was therefore made from the leper residents of the asylums quoted, and the result is given in the subjoined table :- No. of Cases examined. ATE FISH  Habitually. Occasionally. Very seldom. Never. 200  39 57 58 46 It will be seen from this table that 23 per cent. of well- marked lepers had never tasted fish, while a very large number only used it now and then. This is quite in accordance with local opinion on the subject, not only in Kumaun and Garhwal, but also in Kashmir, where leprosy is common among the Gujars, a people in whose dietary this article of food seldom finds a place. It is not within the limits of mathematical probability that the statement of all these people should have been intentionally
Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc.                           317 or unintentionally incorrect, and the onus of proof, therefore may fairly be considered to lie with them who discredit the statements of all patients alike. There is thus, in the opinion of the Commission, no doubt that the consumption of fish is not the cause of leprosy. The fact that a fair number of cases of leprosy exists amongst people who have never touched such food argues sufficiently strongly against the exclusive fish hypothesis as above stated. Salt also has been mentioned in connexion with leprosy, though by laymen rather than scientific writers. Mr. Cony- beare during the early part of this year asked the Under- Secretary of State for India in the House of Commons " whether in the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay the price of salt has risen from 9 annas and 8 annas per maund in 1800 to R2-11 and R2-8 in 1890 respectively; whether he can state the facts, as to the increase or otherwise, in the price of salt for the other presidencies during the same period; whe- ther in India the average consumption of salt per head for all purposes is only 10lb, while in the United Kingdom it is 72lb; whether it be a fact that leprosy has also increased during the same period; and whether the Government will di- rect the special attention of the Medical Commission on Le- prosy in India to an investigation of the apparent connexion between the want of cheap salt and the spread of leprosy." Accordingly special attention was paid to this subject, and, as far as possible, the most accurate information obtained. For the financial and statistical data regarding the price and consumption of salt the Commission are indebted to Mr. J. E. O'Conor, Assistant Secretary of the Government of India in the Department of Finance and Commerce, and they gladly here give expression to their obligation to him. For the present argument, that is the relation between the want of cheap salt and the spread of leprosy, it will not be necessary to go further back than 1861. It is true that in the following provinces, viz., Burma, Rajputana, Central India,
?318                      REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Bombay, Sind and Baluchistan, Nizam's Territory, Madras, My- sore, and Coorg, in the decennial period of 1861-70 salt was cheapest, and has risen in price during the two succeeding decennial periods, and in some instances has done so to a con- siderable degree. On the other hand, in Assam, Bengal North-Western Provinces, Oudh, Punjab, Central Provinces, and Berar, salt has steadily become cheaper.17 Thus, if there be any connexion between leprosy and salt, the best means are given for studying such connexion. For if the spread of the disease depend on want of salt it should have been much more rapid throughout the first mentioned provinces. Before proceeding to the discussion of this point, a few words must be said as to the average consumption per head of salt in India. The total quantity of salt passed into consumption during 1890 last year amounted to 2,801,800,000lb. There is, how- ever, also a considerable quantity of salt made in Burma, of which no exact account is kept, but this is estimated at (at least) 41,143,000lb. There is, again, a considerable quantity manufactured from saltpetre, and some not inconsiderable quan- tities made in Native States. Adding all this to the quantity of which there is an account, and making allowance for quan- tities illicitly made and consumed, there cannot be less than 3,000 millions of pounds for the population of 286,697,000, or between 10 and 11lb per head: 11lb being perhaps the more accurate estimate. Now, in comparing this with the 72lb per head in the United Kingdom, it must be remembered that in India this salt is used almost exclusively for personal consumption, very little being employed for cattle and economic or industrial purposes. Again, the majority of people being vegetarians salt is not in so great demand as in Great Britain and Ireland, nor, owing to (17) "Prices and Wages in India," compiled in the Statistical Branch of the Finance and Commerce Department of the Government of India: Eighth Issue; pages 86-93.
Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc.                       319 the manner in which food is eaten, is there such a waste of salt in India. Between 1870-71 and 1880-81 the consumption of salt in- creased by 19 per cent., and during the next ten years the in- crease was 211/2 per cent. The increase of population in each decade is about 10 per cent., so that the ratio of increase in the consumption of salt was about twice as great as the ratio of increase in the population. And as the consumption is almost entirely human, it seems evident that if the people had enough salt twenty years ago, they have more than enough now. In the interior of the Himalayas the price of salt is very high, not on account of the duty, for the salt consumed there is imported across the frontier duty-free, but as a result of the cost of transit. Excluding such exceptional tracts as Kumaun, Garhwal, and the Naga Hills, where the price of salt may be said to be about 7 seers to the rupee (about 21/4 annas per seer), the highest price of salt in India anywhere is 8 seers per rupee (or 2 annas per seer). The consumption per head being 11lb, the annual cost of salt per head is equal to 11 annas, less than one anna (exactly eleven pie) per month. The average price may, however, be taken to be about 10 seers to the rupee, and the annual cost per head at this rate is under 9 annas, or about 9 pie per month. It may be assumed that the highest cost per head is one anna monthly, which is less than one penny at the present rate of exchange. This is an extreme and exceptional price, for salt ranges at about 8 seers to the rupee in comparatively but few places. Now while discussing the assumed connexion between salt and leprosy, it is necessary to enquire whether the price of this article prevents the native from procuring the amount of salt required to keep his body in proper health. It is difficult to say exactly how much salt a working man actually requires. It is certain "that the various saline matters are
?320             REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: essential to health, that when they are not present in proper proportion nutrition is affected, as is shown by certain forms of scurvy: the peculiar dependence of proteid qualities on the presence of salt is proven, but beyond this very little is known."18 Klein and Verson also have shown that a total abstinence from salt causes an appreciable loss of weight, that is, disturbances in the animal metabolism. The best authorities on dietetics prescribe a daily allowance of 300 to 460 grains of salts, but this includes the sum total of all saline matters necessary for nutrition.19 Hence 100 to 200 grains of sodium chloride might be considered a fair daily allowance. The prison allowance of salt for adult labouring prisoners in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh is 100 grains daily, being at the rate of 43/4lb per annum. In the Punjab the allowance is a quarter of an ounce, or 5.7lb per annum. In Bombay, the Central Provinces, Burma, and Assam the allowance is half an ounce, or about 111/2lb per annum, while in Bengal and Coorg it is 141/4lb per annum. In Madras, final- ly, the daily rate varies from half an ounce in the district prisons to an ounce in the Central Gaols, undoubtedly an unnecessarily large allowance. The scale varies with the diet of the prison- ers, being highest in the rice-eating provinces, where also the consumption of salt by the population outside the prisons is largest. In the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, where the allowance is 43/4lb in the prisons, the consumption of salt per head throughout the province is about 8lb per annum, and it is much the same in the Punjab. And it is remarkable that though in the former provinces the price of salt has since 1871 decreased about 50 per cent., yet the annual consumption per head has remained almost stationary. The non-criminal popu- lation includes, it must be remembered, a large number of children, and allowance being made for these, the consumption (18) M.

Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc.                       321 per head of adult population in most districts is very much in excess of the prison allowance which experience has proved to be ample. Now, as it has been shown that 9 annas, even when the salt is most expensive, will buy the native all the salt he requires for his own personal use during the year, it cannot be said that the high price of this article debars him from obtaining his necessary supply of salt. So, if there be any causal connexion between salt and leprosy, there is no reason why the native should go without his salt, as a few pence will procure his an- nual demand for it. The best mode of showing that such a connexion between leprosy and the price of salt does not exist is a comparison of the leper returns for the three censuses of 1872, 1881, and 1891 side by side with the prices of salt during the decennial periods preceding the enumeration. This is done in Table II. Under "A" all those provinces and divisions are given where, with the exception of the north-western division of the Punjab, the price of salt has steadily diminished, while under " B " those districts are found where the conditions are reversed. It will be seen that the figures do not establish any causal con- nexion between a high price of salt and leprosy, since from the statistics no relativity can be established. The want of salt, therefore, cannot, in the opinion of the Commissioners, be held responsible for the origin or maintenance of the disease. To illustrate this statement more graphically two maps have been constructed. In the former the districts where the price of salt has risen have been coloured red, blue indicating a fall in the rates. Similarly, in the other map, red denotes an in- crease in the leper ratios since the first census, and blue a dimi- nution. If there were any actual connexion between the price of salt and leprosy, the colours in the two maps ought to correspond. It will, however, be seen that they almost replace each other.

?324             Report of the Leprosy Commission: Lastly, water has been considered to be the vehicle of the leprosy bacillus, and thus a means of infection. In some parts of India this is a popular idea, and according to Boinet 20 a similar opinion is held in certain parts of China. The theory seems, however, highly improbable. For whether it be assumed that leprosy bacilli contained in the water enter the body by the mouth or through the broken cuticle, on such hypothesis the disease should be much more generally diffused throughout the empire than it actually is. The tanks in India, filled with more or less stagnant water, are frequented by all classes of people, and the leper is by no means everywhere prevented from bathing with the rest, or filling his lota side by side with a healthy person. He also attends " Melas," and bathes in the company of other pilgrims. Any one who has witnessed the life around the tanks will easily conceive that a disease, if spread by means of water, should be diffused to an alarming extent and at a great rate, especially if such disease be endemic and always present. It seems, moreover, very improbable that the leprosy bacil- lus is capable of multiplying outside the human body. It is, however, quite possible that, like the tubercle bacillus, it remains dormant for a long time after leaving its host. But the above considerations point strongly against the supposition that it exists in ordinary water in this condition. Besides the bacillus has never been found in water, and the observations of the Commissioners were absolutely negative in this respect. They examined water from the tank at Tarn Taran, which is supposed to be beneficial to lepers, and is, therefore, always thronged by them. Yet, as will be seen from the Laboratory Report, although a large number of microscopical specimens were prepared, in not a single instance could the leprosy bacillus be detected. Water, therefore, can hardly be held responsible for the propagation of leprosy. (20) E. Boinet: La Lpre  Hanoi (Tonkin). Reyue de Mdecine. X, No. 8.
?Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc.                       325 Enquiry has been frequently made from intelligent native gentlemen, as well as from patients, as to certain habits and influences which might be concerned in the origin and propa- gation of leprosy. No instance of the transmission of the disease from an animal to man. was met with. Leprosy must be considered exclusively a human disease, and it does not attack domestic or other animals, as is the case with tubercular disease.21 The effects of premature marriages and the con- sumption of opium, alcohol, and other stimulants were also enquired into, but with entirely negative results. And indeed, though undoubtedly certain classes indulge to excess in opium, tobacco, the various forms of Indian hemp, alcoholic prepara- tions from sugar, "mhowa," and the toddy palm, etc., the races of India must be regarded upon the whole as decidedly temperate. Leprosy and Antecedent Diseases. The question of the effect of syphilis was also considered. It seems that when syphilis first appeared it was thought by many to be a new form of leprosy, a modified leprosy. The reason for this belief was the fact that syphilis appeared in Europe about the same time when leprosy began to die out. The leading physicians of that time, however, strongly contest- ed such views. The people were so convinced of the errone- ousness of this theory that the lepers refused to admit syphilitic patients into their hospitals, and the latter had to build special hospitals for themselves.22 "And as leprosy became more and more an unknown disease, partly speculation, partly the observation of certain endemic syphilides, led some physicians back to the ancient supposition."23 At the present time some authorities have propounded the converse theory that leprosy is an effect of syphilis, a modified (21) Cf. Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 2. February 1891, page 130. (22) R. Virchow: op. cit., pages 500 and 501. (23) Ibidem.
?326 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: syphilis. There can be no doubt that syphilis pathologically is nearer related to leprosy than any other affection.24 This, however, is no justification for the more modern theory. In fact, as far as local changes are concerned, an almost greater resemblance exists between lupus and leprosy.25 Yet no one has ever ventured to identify these two affections with one another. Sir W. J. Moore's name is closely associated with what might be called the syphilis-hypothesis. He considers leprosy a phase of inherited syphilis.26 In the opinion of the Commis- sioners this view cannot be supported for the following reasons: (a) the history of this hypothesis, as briefly alluded to above, is entirely against it; (b) there is at most only a resemblance or analogy traceable between the two diseases; (c) certain clinical facts absolutely disprove the theory, unless the present views on syphilis be entirely modified or in part given up. The fact that people contract syphilis after having become affected with leprosy, is quite irreconcilable with the theory under con- sideration that leprosy is a phase of syphilis: and it matters little whether it be congenital or acquired. Of 154 individuals who confessed to having suffered from syphilis, 12 had been thus affected after the appearance of leprosy. At a few asylums every leper was consistently interrogated with a view to obtaining a more or less reliable ratio of syphilis amongst lepers. Out of 458 lepers examined 88, or 192 per cent., were found at one time or another to have suffered from this disease. This percentage may appear high, but too much importance must not be attached to the figures as they stand. In the first place, the ignorance of the informants rendered it impossible to be sure that the disease they described was truly syphilis, and undoubtedly a certain number of cases must be deducted. Yet many of these lepers had the unequivocal marks of tertiary (24) R. Virchow: op. cit., pages 500 and 501. (25) Ibidem. (26) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 1, August 1890, page 27, and "Lancet," May 17, 1890.
Sanitation, Diet, Disease, etc. 327 syphilis on their bodies. Again, no figures are obtainable show- ing the extent to which syphilis and venereal diseases prevail amongst the general population, though this is known to be very large. Lastly, it may be objected that in those instances where syphilis had been contracted subsequent to the development of leprosy, the ignorance of the informant rendered it difficult to decide with certainty as to which was the prior event. These concessions must naturally detract a great deal from the value of Table III. However, three authentic cases were seen by the Commissioners, where there could not be the slightest doubt that syphilis was contracted subsequent to the disease. These were all seen at the asylum in Madras. Two were young men who had suffered from leprosy for the last four and five years respectively: each of them had a typical roseolar second- ary eruption, the characteristic appearances of the tongue, tonsils, and fauces, and moreover one of them presented the remains of a true Hunterian sore, while the other had lost the fraenum praeputii and showed an unmistakable scar. The third case concerned a low caste Hindu, twenty years of age, who had suffered from tubercular leprosy for the last twelve months and at the time of examination actually had a primary sore on the glans penis. These three instances alone are suffi- cient to destroy the syphilis-hypothesis. TABLE III. Relation of Syphilis to Leprosy.   ASYLUM OR LOCALITY. SYPHILIS CASES. REMARKS.  Before Leprosy.

J. Moore's theory? For as these men became lepers they must have been born in the particular phase of congenital syphilis. How, then, is it to be explained that many of these men presented the typical signs of tertiary syphilis concurrently with those of leprosy ? Lastly, it has never been shown that syphilis passes into leprosy, or vice vers. Nor does syphilis ever modify the progress of the local changes in leprosy; and the converse also holds good.27 In conclusion, all that has been said on heredity may be used as arguments against this hypothesis. It is, therefore, impossible to regard syphilis as having any real or specific influence on the production of the disease, or as acting otherwise than by lowering the general tone of the system, and thereby rendering it more liable to attack by, or hastening the progress of, leprosy. (27) R. Virchow: op. cit., page 501.
?330 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Other diseases have been considered the possible cause of leprosy, as malaria or scrofula. It is, however, so plain that there is no scientific evidence for such assumptions that mere mention of these hypotheses will suffice. Summary.-The Commission have come to the conclusion, after full consideration of the circumstances of life of the aver- age native of India, that neither the form of diet, nor the sanitary environment of the individual, have any specific action in the causation of leprosy. But, as will be seen from what has been written, sanitation in this country is far from satisfactory, and leaves very much to be desired in the way of improvement. And it is probable that bad hygienic sur- roundings, deficient or improper food, poverty, exposure, and such diseases as syphilis, are all factors of great importance in reducing the vital powers of the organism and rendering it more susceptible to attack. All such indirect and non- specific causes are specially operative in the case of the offspring of lepers, who are commonly beggars, and living under the most unfavourable conditions for health. Nothing has struck the Commission more forcibly during this enquiry than the improvement in the general health of the sufferer which follows residence in a well-conducted asylum, where cleanliness, regular diet, and sanitary principles are insisted upon and maintained.
?The Treatment of Leprosy. 331 CHAPTER VII. The Treatment of Leprosy. DURING the stay of the Commission in India little op- portunity occurred of personally investigating the effect of treatment on leprosy, for only a short time was spent in any station except Simla, and the latter place was too far from a leper asylum to allow of systematic observations being made. Information as to treatment had, therefore, to be drawn from Indian and other Government reports, from various works on leprosy, and from replies of officers in charge of leper asylums, and of Civil Surgeons who had treated the dis- ease in district hospitals and dispensaries. It has already been pointed out that the incurability of leprosy by any means yet known is unfortunately certain. The following remarks must, therefore, be understood to apply to palliative treatment. This may be conveniently considered under three heads- 1. Hygienic. 2. Medicinal. 3. Surgical. Hygienic. The amount of hygienic treatment possible naturally varies with the circumstances of the patient. What may be practic- able for the rich man will be unattainable by the poor one. This is a truism for all diseases, but it is peculiarly applicable to leprosy. For example, it has been found beneficial in some cases of leprosy to remove the patient to a temperate climate where leprosy is not endemic. This proceeding is, of course, inapplicable to the great majority of Indian lepers, and can, therefore, be dismissed at once. Similarly, if all the lepers of India could be made to wash regularly, to live in roomy and
?332 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: well-ventilated houses, to eat only fresh and nourishing food, to engage in gardening or other healthy outdoor occupation as far as their crippled state would permit, and to observe the greatest care with reference to drainage and sewage dispo- sal, there is no doubt but that their disease would run a much milder course. For this reason, apart from any question of segregation on other grounds, the establishment of voluntary asylums under careful supervision throughout India would do much to lessen the sufferings of the leper, for in them he would be taken away from his usual insanitary surroundings. The difference between the condition of the lepers exa- mined by the Commission in well-organised asylums, and that of outcasts, in many cases without home or friends, collected by the civil authorities, was sufficiently striking. Medicinal. Many drugs have been used in the treatment of leprosy and widely different opinions have been expressed as to their utility. The many secret remedies employed from time to time may be at once dismissed, for they cannot concern a scientific inquiry. Nor would space permit a dissertation on all the known medicines which have been given for leprosy. Only those will be discussed which have attracted attention, or which have appeared to be of some value. The oils of India may be conveniently considered in the first place. Dr. George Watt1 mentions the following oils as having been used in the treatment of leprosy- 1. Albizzia Lebbek. 2. Anacardium occidentale. 3. Cynometra ramiflora. 4. Dipterocarpus turbinatus. 5. Gynocardia odorata. 6. Hydnocarpus Wightiana. 7. Hydnocarpus venenata. 8. Pongamia glabra. 9. Psoralea corylifolia. 10. Semecarpus Anacardium. (1) Dictionary of the Economic Products of India, Vol. IV, page 309; Vol. V, Part I, pages 462 and 463; Vol. V, Part II, page 354.
?The Treatment of Leprosy. 333 Dr. Vandyke Carter2 also says that the oil of Arachis hy- poga, the ground-nut, has been used, but that its utility is not apparent. Of the above eleven oils only four need be discussed at length. They are Anacardium occidentale, or Cashew-nut oil, Dipterocarpus turbinatus, or Gurjun or Kanyin oil, Gynocardia odorata, or Chaulmoogra oil, and Hydnocarpus Wightiana, or Kowti oil. They will be referred to in the order in which they occur on the list. ANACARDIUM OCCIDENTALE. This oil played an important part in the plan of treatment adopted by Dr. Beauperthuy at Cumana in Venezuela. Sev- eral cures having been alleged, Dr. Bakewell was deputed to examine and report on the cases treated. His official report was presented to both Houses of Parliament in 1871, and spoke highly in favour of the results obtained by Dr. Beauper- thuy. The main features of the treatment are these- 1. Hygienic Rules. The patient must have pure air and nourishing food, in- cluding a moderate amount of fresh meat daily, with a sufficient quantity of fresh vegetables. He must abstain from salted meat or fish. 2. External Applications. Frictions over the whole of the skin with cocoanut oil or olive oil are to be employed twice a day. These are to be followed by soap and water baths. The oil of cashew-nut is then applied by means of a small piece of sponge to the (2) Reports on Leprosy, Second Series, page 33.
334 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: diseased parts. The skin must not be broken, and the exuda- tion must be allowed to dry on, so as to form a crust. After about twelve days this will fall off, leaving the skin beneath clear and free from ulceration. It is not advisable to paint at one time an area greater than that represented by the skin of the leg or fore-arm. The applications should not be re- peated at intervals of less than a week. 3. Internal Medicines. These are perchloride of mercury in doses of one-fifteenth to one-twentieth of a grain twice a day for adults, and in cases where mercury is contra-indicated, sodium carbonate, given in doses of 10 to 20 grains twice a day. There is no doubt that this was a rational mode of treat- ment, and one which afforded distinct relief to the patient. The mistake made was in regarding it as curative. Whatever merit the treatment possessed lay in the strict regimen which had to be observed by the patient, and in the attention to the functions of the skin which was insured by frequent baths and frictions. The oil of cashew itself merely acts as a caus- tic, and the same result can be less laboriously obtained in tuberculated leprosy by free excision of tubercles, as will be mentioned below. The influence of the medicines given internally by Dr. Beauperthuy may fairly be disregarded. According to Dr. Bakewell a patient taking sodium carbonate progressed quite as favourably as one taking mercury perchloride. Internal medication has always been the difficulty in leprosy. It is not hard to treat the skin complications and even to attain some measure of success, but so far no drug has been disco- vered which taken by the mouth will bear the relation to leprosy which mercury and potassium iodide bear to syphilis. Fresh crops of tubercles, or ansthetic patches, soon make their appearance, and, as was the case at Cumana, the condition of

The use of this oil in the treatment of leprosy was first recommended by Surgeon-Major J. Dougall3 at Port Blair, Andaman Islands. Two emulsions were made by direction of Dr. Dougall. The first was to be taken internally and consisted of three parts of lime water and one part of gurjun oil. The second emulsion for external use contained equal parts of gurjun oil and lime water. The lepers rose every morning at daybreak and bathed, using dry earth as a detergent, so as to rub off the previous day's inunction. They afterwards drank half an ounce of the first emulsion. The second was then rubbed in for two hours. At 3 P.M. the same dose was given, and another two hours' friction practised. Dr. Dougall tried the effect of this treatment on twenty- five lepers for a period of six months and says4: "The time has been long enough to show that leprosy, both tubercular and ansthetic, can not only be arrested, but the condition of the lepers can be greatly ameliorated; and men here who have not for years been able to do more than drag out a miserable helpless existence are now able and willing to work, and every sore is quite healed." This report was sufficiently encouraging to justify investi- gations into the gurjun oil treatment of leprosy. The Madras Government in the course of the next year published an ac- count of the results obtained with gurjun oil in the hospitals and asylums of that Presidency. Surgeon-General E. G.

?336 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Balfour, in his covering letter, arranges the medical reports in three groups5- (1) Those of officers in charge of the three Leper Hospitals.-In these reports the opinion is ex- pressed that the oil does not possess any particular efficacy; (2) Those of officers in charge of Civil Dispensaries and Gaols.-These on the whole are favourable, and several cases of improvement are reported; (3) Those of Regimental Medical Officers.-The cases under this head are necessarily few, as declared leprosy is considered to unfit the subject for further service and he is discharged. Gurjun oil is reported to be useful in alleviating the more prominent symp- toms of leprosy, and one case is said to have been cured. On the whole, Dr. Balfour considers the results of the trial of gurjun oil to be encouraging, but points out that in the supposed cases of cure it will be necessary to watch the future medical history of the patient. In Dr. Watt's Dictionary6 a summary is given of answers received from nineteen medical men in India who were specially questioned as to the utility of gurjun oil in leprosy. Of these answers thirteen were positive, three negative, and three neutral. Answers were received by the Commission from a large number of stations in which gurjun oil had been used for leprosy. Many of these answers reported that more or less relief had been obtained, but in no instance was there any allusion to a cure. In some cases the relief afforded was very slight. From other stations the answers stated that no effect (5) Report on the Treatment of Leprosy with Gurjun oil and other Remedies in Hospitals of the Madras Presidency. Madras, 1876: page ix. (6) Op. cit., Vol. III, page 169.
The Treatment of Leprosy.                         337 whatever had been observed. Some answers were neutral, the patients having disappeared from observation, or the time during which they had been under treatment having been too short to draw conclusions as to the efficacy of the oil. Dr. Hillis, who tried this treatment in the Mahaica Leper Asylum, says7: " I can claim for gurjun oil that, given a suit- able case, the disease can be arrested by it, and that in a few instances there has been no return of the disease for over two years, but it may nevertheless be premature to say a cure has taken place." This experience was not borne out in the Trinidad Asylum,8 where a trial of the oil showed only such temporary relief as would follow frictions with cocoanut oil or any other simple application. Dr. Vandyke Carter9 also failed to find that gurjun oil exerted any specific effect on the course of leprosy. He used the drug internally and externally in selected cases for months, without obtaining any perceptible improvement. From the above review of the various trials which have been made with gurjun oil, it appears that though a certain amount of temporary relief may follow its use, it is very doubtful whether this is more than can be obtained with any common oil. Dr Dougall's success at Port Blair was probably due to the fact that he was dealing with a colony of convict lepers under prison discipline, and was, therefore, able to carry out his plan of treatment far more rigorously than in an asylum where, as a rule, patients are averse to any thera- peutic measures which involve the least exertion. It is quite possible that the prolonged frictions with dry earth, and the regular sea-bathing, were quite as potent in affording relief as the use of the gurjun oil.

?338 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: GYNOCARDIA ODORATA. This oil has long been known in the East as a remedy for leprosy, but it is only of late years that it has attracted notice in Europe. Like gurjun oil it is used both internally and externally. Of eight answers recorded by Dr. Watt10 from medical men who had used chaulmoogra oil in leprosy, four were favourable, two denied that any result was obtained, while two were neutral and expressed no opinion as to the value of the oil. Dr. Vandyke Carter11 selected cases for treatment with chaulmoogra oil and arranged them under as follows:- (a)   Young fairly nourished subjects with early disease. In them the result was decidedly beneficial. (b)   Confirmed, but not disabled lepers. The effect of the oil on these was moderately beneficial. (c)   Confirmed, disabled, or broken-down subjects. No result was obtained in these patients. Dr. Carter goes on to say that the longer the oil is used, the more favourable will the result be, both in degree and permanence. The good effect may last for three, four, or five years after prolonged use of the oil, but the disease is never eradicated even in the most suitable cases. Of the first forty-seven answers received by the Commis- sion from asylums and stations in which chaulmoogra oil had been used, thirty reported more or less relief after the use of the oil. In some the relief was very slight, while in others the disease was said to be arrested. In no case was a cure reported. From twelve stations the reports showed that there was no effect after chaulmoogra treatment, while five answers did not express an opinion one way or the other. (10) Op. cit., Vol. IV, page 194. (11) Op. cit., page 34.
?The Treatment of Leprosy. 339 Mr. Sakharam Arjun,12 who was in charge of the ward for incurables in the Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital, Bombay, gives his opinion of the value of chaulmoogra oil as follows:- "Under the prolonged and continuous use of this oil the progress of the disease is arrested, the skin becomes soft and supple, the discolorations vanish, the different morbid sensa- tions leave the patient, the mental hebetude passes away, the impaired sensibility is completely or partially restored, the ulcers heal and cicatrise though ever prone to break out again, and the general nutrition of the tissues improves, patients crippled before being known to walk about unassisted and to gain in strength and weight." In the Trinidad Leper Asylum13 many of the more intelli- gent patients asked for chaulmoogra oil of their own accord and continued its use for several months. One man used the oil internally and externally for seven years. The tubercles disappeared from his face and extre- mities and the ansthesia was lessened. The fact that these lepers persevered in any plan of treat- ment is in itself strong presumptive evidence that they derived some benefit from the drug employed, for, as was pointed out earlier in this chapter, such patients soon tire of any systematic medication. The chief results obtained in eighteen cases were- 1. Increase of perspiration. 2. Decrease of tubercles. 3. Improved appetite and sense of well-being. 4. Increase of sensation. 5. Increased suppleness of skin and lessening of pains in joints. A similar result was observed in a highly intelligent private patient who had taken chaulmoogra capsules for six years, and who had also tried residence in Europe. At one time he (12) Report on Leprosy, 1873. (13) Report on Trinidad Leper Asylum for 1889, pages 11 and 12. Z 2
?340                REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: took seventy-five drops of the oil a day. When last seen the face was clear, but there were one or two nodules in the lobes of the ears, and a few small reddish patches on the thighs. The intervals between the tubercular outbreaks were much greater, and the patient was able to do a great deal of riding. From the above experiences derived from various sources it seems that the action of chaulmoogra oil in leprosy, though at the best palliative, is nevertheless more marked than that of gurjun oil. Indeed it is probable that a prolonged and regular use of this oil may in some cases arrest the progress of the disease, though for how long must still be doubtful. HYDNOCARPUS WIGHTIANA. This oil was employed together with chaulmoogra oil in the treatment originated by the late Mr. Bhao Daji, which attained such notoriety in Bombay about twenty years ago. Apparently the first results obtained were encouraging, but Dr. Vandyke Carter,14 who was living in Bombay at the time, and who had, therefore, ample opportunities of observing the effect of this treatment, writes as follows:-"I have before me notes of three or four cases which were duly treated here, and in none has a cure been effected, for either no good whatever resulted, or the symptoms are simply quiescent." Dr. Carter, however, considers that kowti oil is a useful aid in the treatment of leprosy. The most noteworthy oils used in the treatment of leprosy have now been discussed. From what has been said above it will be evident that any oil which is thoroughly rubbed into the skin may afford more or less relief. Hence it will not be neces- sary to discuss the other seven oils mentioned at the beginning of this section, for no specific action can be claimed for any of them. (14) Reports on Leprosy, Second Series, 1876, page 36.
The Treatment of Leprosy.                           341 Two common Indian plants, which have attained a consi- derable reputation in the treatment of leprosy, may here be mentioned. They are the Madar (Calotropis gigantea) and the Asiatic Pennywort (Hydrocotyle Asiatica). From evi- dence collected, however, it appears that their value has been overstated.15 The first is said to be temporarily useful as a tonic in recent cases of leprosy, while the stimulant effects of the second on the circulation are most marked in the pre- liminary ansthetic stages of the disease. These drugs have clearly no specific action in leprosy. Arsenic is a drug which has been largely used in the treat- ment of leprosy, and sometimes with good result. Dr. Bower- bank16 writing from Jamaica says: "In only one case did medi- cal treatment seem to keep the disease in check. During eighteen or twenty years the patient, a female, had repeated attacks of apparently intermittent fever, and on each occasion the characteristic spots made their appearance; she had also ansthesia and slight enlargement of the eyebrows and lobules of the ears. The use of Fowler's solution always checked the disease. " Dr. W. Nicholson17 of Antigua also remarks: " Arsenic is the only remedy which in my practice has had any effect in arresting the disease, and that only for a time. I have seen the tubercles disappear under its use, sensation restored to fingers that were incapable of feeling and using a needle, so that the patient was enabled to sew, yet the disease returned and proved fatal. " In the Trinidad Asylum18 arsenic was given during several months to two lepers who were particularly subject to frequent acute outbreaks of tubercles. One of these patients was (15) Dictionary of the Economic Products of India, by Dr. G. Watt, Vol. II, page 45, Vol. IV, page 313.

342              REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: German, the other a slightly coloured Barbadian. Both had very delicate skins, and the result observed after prolonged treatment with liquor arsenicalis was a very marked diminution in the frequency of the tubercular eruptions. The German, in fact, was free from an attack for about a year, whereas before he began taking arsenic the exacerbations had occurred at intervals of a few weeks. The use of ichthyol and resorcin in the treatment of leprosy was recommended by Dr. Unna of Hamburg in 1886. Since that time they have been used in various parts of the world, but the results obtained have hardly fulfilled expectations. It is true that many of the cutaneous complications of leprosy may be relieved or removed by the use of these drugs, but the same result can be obtained with a simple application such as vaseline. Ichthyol and resorcin have lately been issued by the Government for trial in the various Indian stations. Reference to the table at the end of this chapter will show that little effect has followed their use in leprosy. Still more recently Dr. Lutz in Hawaii has brought to notice a new group of drugs for the treatment of leprosy. In a report, dated June 30th, 1890, he says: " In general we have had no instance of the disease making progress in patients treated by the most efficacious means, that is, salol and salicylate of soda internally, and chrysarobin and pyrogallic acid externally." Some members of the Commission tested the action of salol on two lepers in Simla who happened to present themselves for treatment, but observed no result. Surgeon-Major H. D. Cook kindly treated a number of patients in the Madras Leper Asy- lum with salol, and his report is appended. From an ambulatory treatment little or nothing could be ex- pected, as this naturally excludes all clinical observation. Dr. Cook's verdict confirms the opinion of Dr. Lutz, that as a palliative, salol is of decided value in leprosy. The results, even after a course of five weeks, are so promising that the treatment is being continued at the Madras Asylum. No doubt,
?The Treatment of Leprosy.                         343 prolonged and critical observation is necessary before a decid- ed opinion can be given; and this Dr. Cook has fully realised. There can, however, be no question as to the temporary benefit derived from the salol treatment. Doses of twenty grains were given three times a day for two weeks, and then increased to thirty grains three times a day. Apparently large doses must be given for a long time. Most of the cases subjected to the treatment suffered from tubercular or mixed leprosy. The greatest testimony in favour of the drug is, that the patients professed to feel better and gladly persisted in the treatment, while the native as a rule is easily disheartened and will not subject himself to therapeutic measures which after a short trial give him no relief. Bad effects were hardly ever observed, even after large doses of salol. On the other hand, tubercles seem to decrease in size, ulcerate, and then subside or heal up: a fresh crop of tubercles follows and goes through the same phases. Sensation was often restored, and ansthetic areas, in fact, at times became hypersthetic; patches improved in colour, and the scaly, shiny appearance of the skin which is so characteristic of certain forms of leprosy, assumed a healthier look, and the skin became moist and more sensitive. The general condition of the patient often improved greatly. With such favourable results after so short a period, it is justifiable to persevere. Accordingly Dr. Cook is continuing the treatment, and thus better means will be given to fully estimate the value of salol. If future experience confirms these early observations, then Dr. Lutz has indeed found in salol a valuable drug for the palliative treatment of leprosy. A brief allusion only need be made to such drugs as per- chloride of iron, potassium iodide, and cod-liver oil. These are often very useful adjuncts in the treatment of leprosy, but their action is exactly the same as in other diseases. Mercury may be used when the leper is suffering from syphilis. The latter disease will be rapidly brought under control, while the leprosy remains uninfluenced. The risk of giving mercury in
?344             REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: leprosy, which some writers have insisted on, appears to be overrated. There is no doubt that with ordinary care this drug may be as freely given in leprosy as in any other disease. From the above evidence it would appear that chaulmoogra oil and arsenic are the most valuable drugs at present known for the palliative treatment of leprosy; and if further experience and observation justify the hopes expressed by Dr. Cook at the beginning of his treatment of lepers with salol, then the latter must rank high among the drugs used and given for the amelioration of the general and local condition of these patients. It must, however, always be remembered that spontaneous sub- sidence of tubercles, or even arrest of the disease, may take place without any treatment, hence it is always difficult to esti- mate the part contributed by drugs to any good result which may follow their use. Surgical. Much may be done to relieve the leper by surgical interfer- ence. It may be stated as a general rule that any operation which would be undertaken on another patient may be per- formed on one suffering from leprosy. The rapidity with which the tissues of lepers heal after operation is remarkable. This may, perhaps, be due to the excess of fibrin which has been found in the blood of these patients, a fact which was first pointed out by Danielssen and Boeck,19 and which has since been confirmed by Hillairet 20 and at the Trinidad Asylum.21 In the last-named institution an examination of the blood of fifty lepers, tuberculated, ansthetic, and mixed, showed the average quantity of fibrin to be '7 per cent. An operation which has attracted considerable attention as a means of treatment in leprosy is nerve-stretching. This has yielded good results as practised by Surgeon-Major Lawrie, 22 (19)  Trait de la Spedalskhed. Paris, 1848. (20)  Annales de Dermatologie et Syphilographie. (21)  Report on Trinidad Leper Asylum for 1887. (22)  Lancet, 1881.
The Treatment of Leprosy.                         345 and by Drs. Downes,23 Neve,24 Mitra,25 and others in India. In Trinidad26 out of one hundred cases operated on, more or less relief was obtained in about half. The chief results noticed were relief of pain in the course of the nerves operated on, healing of perforating ulcers in the area supplied by these nerves, and, more rarely, some decrease of ansthesia. Unfor- tunately none of these effects were permanent, and the opera- tion had sometimes to be repeated on the same nerve. There is no doubt, however, that nerve-stretching is a valuable aid, especially in the treatment of the distressing neuralgia which often complicates leprosy. But the operation cannot be claimed as in any way curative. Free excision of cutaneous tubercles is a procedure which is followed for a time by good results, and if a drug could be found which given internally would prevent recurrence of these growths, there would be a fair hope of ultimate suc- cess. By cutting deeply it is possible to eradicate single tuber- cles or circumscribed masses of tubercle and to obtain a clean cicatrix, but after a few weeks or months the growths begin to recur in the sound skin around these cicatrices, and the patient relapses as rapidly as after the Beauperthuy treatment. Much pain is often experienced in perforating ulcers and in sinuses leading to dead bone, especially by patients who are other wise ansthetic. Free incision down to the bone gives great relief in these cases. The effect of this treatment is appreciated by the patients, who eagerly beg to be operated on. There is also no doubt that early incision in such cases does much to prevent the gangrene which is so common in leprosy. When this gangrene has actually set in, amputa- (23) Lancet, 1886.

?346             REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: tion high up will often save life, and the patient will regain flesh and strength in a remarkable manner. Dyspna, due to invasion of the larynx by tubercles, is not uncommon in leprosy, and sometimes necessitates tracheo- tomy. Life may be greatly prolonged after this operation. Dr. P. S. Abraham,27 after a visit to the Norwegian Leper Asylums in 1888, writes: "I was shown numerous cases of amputations and tracheotomies. One patient at Bergen had worn a tube for three years, another for seven years, another at Trondhjem for ten years, and a great many others in all the asylums for shorter periods. In one case at Trondhjem the larynx subsequently became functionally useful, and the tube was discarded and the opening closed." Lastly, reference must be made to the ophthalmic com- plications so common in leprosy. Leloir28 noted during his visit to Norway that of sixty-four lepers at Molde, forty-one had ophthalmic lesions, in thirty-seven both eyes were affected, while six were absolutely blind. The two commonest affections of the eye in leprosy are invasion of the cornea by tubercles, and paralytic ectropion, the former occurring in the tuberculated, the latter in the ansthetic form of the disease. To arrest the progress of tubercles across the cornea various methods of treatment have been adopted. Kaurin has attained considerable success by the performance of keratotomy. Danielssen and Hansen have produced similar results by cauterizing the conjunctiva or cornea round the tubercle. In the Trinidad Asylum ligature of the vessels supplying the tubercle has arrested its growth for a time. Iridectomy will in some cases temporarily avert total blind- ness, though it cannot affect the progress of the disease. It must, however, be undertaken before the iris becomes involved (27) Epidemiological Society's Transactions, Vol. VIII, page 135. (28) Trait Pratique et Theorique de la Lpre, page 316.
?The Treatment of Leprosy.                         347 in the leprous growth, otherwise it will be found impossible to excise sufficient to produce any appreciable effect. For paralytic ectropion Kaurin practises tarsoraphy with good results. Epiphora is greatly reduced, and closure of the lids is effected. Enough has now been said of the surgical treatment of leprosy to show that in any well-organised asylum no operation need be refused. Indeed the leper may be treated like an ordinary surgical patient in a general hospital.

?Appendix I to Chapter VII. 359 APPENDIX I. SURGEON-MAJOR H. D. COOK'S REPORT ON SALOL IN THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY. OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT LEPER HOSPITAL, Madras, 31st August 1891. From-SURGEON-MAJOR H. D. COOK, M.B., Supdt., Government Leper Hospital, To-A. A. KANTHACK, Esq., F.R.C.S., Member of the Leprosy Commis- sion. I have the honour to inform you that, in compliance with your request, I began the treatment of twelve patients, selected for the purpose, with Salol on the 26th ultimo and continued it up to date (a period of five weeks), strictly adhering to your instructions. According to directions 1 administered 3 doses, a dose after each meal daily, beginning with 20 grains and increasing it to 30 grains. A careful diagnosis was made of each case, and duly registered prior to the treatment, and critically scrutinized from time to time during the treatment, and any perceptible reaction duly noted. So far as can be seen from observation of the twelve cases under treatment Salol has a mitigating effect, ulcers heal and tubercles ulcerate and subside, fresh tubercles crop up and burst, subside, and are followed by another lot, and so on. I am of opinion that sufficient time has not been allowed to enable me to form a correct estimate of the value of salol as a therapeutic agent in leprosy, and that a steady, unremitted course of three months' treatment with it would at least be required. So I will keep up these cases and send you the continua- tion of the treatment, even after you go home, if you should so wish. DETAILED REPORT OF TWELVE CASES OF LEPROSY TREATED WITH SALOL.

Since the return of the Commissioners to England Dr. Cook has continued the above treatment, but apparently without success, as may be gathered from his letter. [GOVERNMENT LEPER HOSPITAL,] Madras, 11th November 1891. From-Surgeon-Major H. D. COOK, M.B., Supdt., Govt. Leper Hospital, Madras; To-A. A. KANTHACK, Esq., F.R.C.S., St. John's College, Cambridge. In continuation of my letter of 31st August 1891, I have to inform you that the salol treatment was continued up to 12th October 1891, thereby terminating the three months' treatment suggested by me-a trial sufficiently long to evince the virtue of Salol as a specific in leprosy. A few of the twelve cases under treatment derived some benefit, while the others improved in parts previously affected, but have broken out in parts formerly unaffected. Tubercles have sub- sided and already existing ulcers healed up, but after some time fresh tubercles and ulcers appeared. In addition patients complained of loss of appetite, lassitude and a disagreeable burning sensation in the stomach, eyes; in fact throughout the body. Considering that leprosy is a disease, requiring a steady persevering course of treatment, ex- tending over a period of three months, if necessary a year, a specific that would recommend itself and combat successfully with the disease must necessarily possess properties of a progressively beneficial nature, so that its continued use would have no disagreeable counteraction; it must have tonic and alterative properties, and be such that its use could be continued for a long time without the least ill-effect. Salol in my estimation is of no therapeutic value in leprosy; in fact, I consider it a decided failure.
?Appendix II to Chapter VII. 367 APPENDIX II. EXPERIMENTS ON THE ACTION OF TUBERCULIN IN LEPROSY. In connection with the treatment of leprosy mention must be made of a series of experiments with Koch's fluid which Surgeon- Major H. D. Cook of Madras kindly performed for the Commission. Twelve lepers were treated with tuberculin, obtained from Dr. A. Libbertz of Berlin. The observations were made, with but faint hope of achieving any therapeutic success, but rather to test the diagnostic value of the medium. For assuming tuberculin to be a specific in tubercular affection, it could  priori scarcely be considered probable that as such it could have been of any use in leprosy, even though one must allow a certain pathological resemblance between the two dis- eases. Besides, by the time the tuberculin reached India the majority of men expressed their doubt as to its efficacy even in tubercular disease. Various physicians,1 notably amongst them Dr. P. S. Abra- ham, Dr. Arning, Dr. Goldschmidt and Drs. Babs and Kalindero have tried the injection of Koch's fluid, but in no case has there been any permanent improvement, and hardly even any temporary benefit. Difference of opinion has been expressed as to value as a diagnostic means of tuberculin, that is, whether or no the injection of tuberculin is followed by a general and local reaction of a characteristic type. It was especially to test this point that the Commission requested Dr. Cook to try the effect of tuberculin on a number of lepers, care- fully selected, free from any suspicion of tubercular disease, repre- senting the various types of leprosy. No advanced cases were employed. Dr. Cook's detailed report will be found appended. Here a short extract, with the conclusions based on the experiments, will be given. The patients were all male Hindus, young adults suffering from leprosy in its less advanced stages. Four were affected with the ansthetic form of the disease, four with tubercular leprosy, and the remaining four with the mixed form. Each patient was observed for a few days previous to the commencement of the injections and the day before, the temperature taken at morning, noon, and night. Then a minimal dose of tuberculin was injected (001cc), sometimes into an apparently healthy part, at other times into the diseased tissues. An interval of twenty-four hours always elapsed between two successive injections, (1) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 2, February 1890, page 110, et seq.
?368 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: and to begin with, the dose was increased by 001cc until 005 was reached, when it was ventured to increase it by 002cc; 01 was the maximum dose ever given. The temperature was carefully observed every three hours, and whenever it rose above 1025 the dose was not increased, but the same or a smaller dose given, until the temperature remained at or below 1025 for some time. Injections were never continued, until the phenomena of reaction had abated. No case was in any way, generally or locally, improved, although the treatment was continued for at least three weeks. One or two patients were decidedly the worse for the injections, being reduced in general health. In two instances the patients acknowledged a return of sensation into a primarily ansthetic region, but this passed off quickly. In another case several ulcers healed up and remained so at the time the treatment was discontinued ; in one instance tubercles in the face became less prominent. But with these exceptions the im- provements were but slight and momentary, or altogether absent, so that the lepers lost all faith and patience. In four cases the use of tuberculin was followed by a general outbreak of psoriasis all over the body. These were of the mixed or tubercular type. A general reaction was absent in two ansthetic cases, one tuber- cular and one mixed case (or in four out of twelve cases). In seven cases,-one ansthetic, three tubercular, and three mixed-it was well marked, while in one case it was but weak. The mere absence or presence of a general reaction, therefore, cannot be made the criterion between leprosy or tuberculosis, as was at one time assumed by Dr. Arning.2 In Dr. Cook's patients tuberculosis was out of the question. According to Professors V. Babes and Kalindero,3 the general reac- tion in the case of leprosy essentially differs from that established in tuberculosis. There is no doubt from a perusal of Dr. Cook's cases that, in accordance with these authors, a stronger dose is required to produce a febrile reaction in leprosy than in tuberculosis. Again the twelve cases confirm the statement of the same writers that in leprosy the general reaction, instead of in about six hours, does not ordin- arily appear until twenty-four hours after injection. The cases offer, however, no evidence that the fever and concomitant symptoms last longer than in tuberculosis. But they may be said, on the whole, to confirm the other statement that after the first reaction a second appears on the following day, and at times even a third the day after (cf. Case XII). Local reactions failed in almost every case, (2) Deutsche Med. Wochenschr, 1890, 50. (3) Semaine Mdicale. Jan. 26, 1891.

Amelioration of the general condition was not observed, but a general weakness was not uncommon. The Commissioners, therefore, agree with Professors Babs and Kalindero that there are essential differences in the character of the reactions in the case of leprosy and tuberculosis, respectively, where these are typical ; and that in a number of cases (as far as it is allowed to argue from so small a number of cases), Koch's remedy might distinguish whether an affection is leprous or tubercular, provided it were proven that a typical reaction follows in all cases of tubercular, but never appears in healthy individuals. But they think that it can hardly be employed in the diagnosis of a suspicious trophoneurotic disease, seeing that of four anaesthetic cases no reaction occurred in two cases, while in a third case it was very weak. The most marked reactions occur in purely tubercular and mixed cases. The Commissioners  also have no doubt that as far as leprosy is concerned, the remedy is of no therapeutic value, but, on the other hand, may not be altogether free from danger.

?370 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: SURGEON-MAJOR H. D. COOK'S REPORT ON TUBERCULIN. GOVERNMENT LEPER HOSPITAL, Madras, June 1891. From-Surgeon-Major H. D. COOK, M.B., Supdt., Govt. Leper Hospital, Madras. To-A. A. KANTHACK, Esq., F.R.C.S., New Club, Simla. With reference to your letter dated Simla, 22nd April 1891, I have the honour to inform you that, in accordance with the directions con- tained therein, regarding the use of "Tuberculin," I began the treat- ment with it on twelve lepers selected for the purpose on the 27th ultimo and continued it till the 20th instant. A minute diagnosis of each of these twelve cases being recorded (as per cases attached), they were inoculated with solutions of tuber- culin carefully prepared by the local Chemical Examiner to the minimum strength of '001, and gradually increasing it at each succes- sive injection performed every alternate day. When the temperature exceeded 102.5, the minimum strength or one of less strength than that used at the previous operation, as the case required, was injected, till it reached '01cc. From the careful observation of their temperatures with a clinical thermometer, every third hour, five times daily, and duly registered, the only effects noticeable were an increase of temerature, only tem- porarily attaining a maximum of 105 in three cases, accompanied with fever; and an average of 100.5 in others, while in three of these cases the temperature slightly exceeded the normal. These symptoms, unaccompanied with the least mitigation of the disease, were the only results attained, and as the trial given was sufficiently long to exhibit any virtue, if there be, of the remedy, I have decided to discontinue the treatment. The patients who were under treatment got disheartened and one of them got very ill. These cases were typical of the various forms of leprosy, carefully selected, and not in an advanced stage, and I may remark here that every detail of the whole treatment was strictly observed from 27th May till 20th June 1891. The injections and the registration of tempera- ture have been scrupulously carried out, so that I can safely say a fair trial has been given.
Appendix II to Chapter VII. 371 From the above remarks it may be seen that so far no mitigation of the symptoms has occurred, and therefore I think the "Tuberculin" for leprosy is a decided failure. It may be said that the injection should be continued for a long time, but the patients would not sub- mit to a painful treatment, seeing no good result therefrom. The Resident Apothecary, Mr. M. Nur Mahomed, has taken great pains with these cases throughout. Recording temperatures every three hours in twelve cases is of itself an irksome duty, and my thanks are due to him for so cheerfully assisting me with the experi- ments. 2 B 2

?384 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: CONCLUSIONS. The following conclusions are based upon the observations and arguments contained in the foregoing report:- 1. Leprosy is a disease sui generis; it is not a form of syphilis or tuberculosis, but has striking tiolo- gical analogies with the latter. 2. Leprosy is not diffused by hereditary transmission, and for this reason, and the established amount of sterility among lepers, the disease has a natural tendency to die out. 3. Though in a scientific classification of diseases leprosy must be regarded as contagious and also inoculable, yet the extent to which it is propagated by these means is exceedingly small. 4. Leprosy is not directly originated by the use of any particular article of food, nor by any climatic or telluric conditions, nor by insanitary surroundings; neither does it peculiarly affect any race or caste. 5. Leprosy is indirectly influenced by insanitary sur- roundings, such as poverty, bad food, or deficient drainage or ventilation, for these by causing a pre- disposition increase the susceptibility of the indivi- dual to the disease. 6. Leprosy in the great majority of cases originates de novo, that is, from a sequence or concurrence of causes and conditions, dealt with in the report, and which are related to each other in ways at present imperfectly known.
?Conclusions and Practical Suggestions. 385 Practical Suggestions. Segregation may be voluntary or compulsory, and in either instance partial or complete. Complete segregation has never yet been possible. Both in the Sandwich Islands and in Norway it has failed. "It appears that there has always been great difficulty in the Sandwich Islands1 in carrying out a full measure of segre- gation. This fact comes out in several of the reports; and in the latest of them we see it stated that for some period during the administration as President of the Board of Health of Mr. Gibson, who apparently doubted its efficacy, the work of seg- regation had been practically brought to an end. At the present time there is an endeavour to enforce rigorously the isolation of lepers." Again," the isolation of lepers in the Norway2 asylums is not absolute. The doors and gates of the institutions are not locked, and more than once I met some of the inmates in the neighbouring roads. The doctors informed me that they allowed those to go out who showed no ulcerations, and that no cases of consequent infection have ever been traced. The lepers, however, are usually kept in on market days, and at Trondhjem at least, and I believe elsewhere, they are not permitted to enter houses and churches, and to come in close contact with other people." "To attribute the decline of leprosy in Norway3 to com- pulsory isolation is entirely erroneous. In the first place no such powers exist or are likely to be sanctioned by the Norse (1) P. S. Abraham.

?386 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: democracy; if they did exist it would be impossible without further accommodation to segregate even the reduced number of lepers in Norway at the present time. Indeed, I met many lepers in the streets of Bergen and on the quay going about their usual vocations. It is not that segregation is stamping out leprosy in Norway, but the increased material prosperity of the people, the growth of foreign trade, the inter-com- munication with town life, and the opportunities these give for better and more varied subsistence, which have doubtless effected beneficent changes in this direction." The amount of legislation which at present exists in Norway may be best expressed in the following words of Dr. G. A. Hansen4: "Though the disease was steadily diminishing I found that something ought to be done to check the spread of the disease in the country, besides what might be done by the entrance of lepers into our asylums. In consequence I proposed a law which was enacted in 1885. This law gives the Sanitary Commission or Board of Health in each district the right to order a leper, if he will live at home, that he must have his own room at least his own bed, that his clothes ought to be washed separately, that he must have his own eating apparatus,-spoon, fork, knife, etc. If he cannot, or will not comply with this regimen, he is obliged to enter an asylum." From the above quotations it is at once evident that even in the two countries in which segregation of lepers is commonly believed to be complete, the actual procedure falls far short of this. For India complete compulsory segregation may be considered to be absolutely impracticable. Neither do the conclusions given above as to the nature of the disease justify any recommendation for absolute segregation. The presence (4) G. A. Hansen.

?Conclusions and Practical Suggestions. 387 of a leper in a healthy community is a source of danger no greater than the presence of an individual suffering from tuber- culosis. Both diseases are contagious in an equal and minimal degree. The amount of ulceration which exists in both diseases is to some extent a measure of the danger of contagion. It is impossible for the same reasons to advise compulsory partial isolation. Voluntary isolation is, therefore, the only measure left for consideration. Among civilised communities the separation of those suffering from many diseases other than leprosy is encouraged. The voluntary isolation of the leper is, therefore, no exception to this custom. For this reason the Commissioners recommend the adoption of a voluntary isola- tion as extensive as local circumstances allow. Further, by permitting marriages among lepers, the plan suggested might be the more easily carried out. In accordance with instructions received from the Com- mittee of the National Leprosy Fund, the Commissioners are required in their final report to describe minutely what they believe to be the best plans for ensuring the efficient carrying out in practice of their recommendations relating to the treat- ment of lepers. Conformably with these directions the Commissioners, though they are fully aware that the extent and varying social conditions of the empire may present great practical difficulties, venture to suggest the following schemes. The Commission are of opinion that the sale of articles of food and drink by lepers should be prohibited, and that they should be prevented from practising prostitution, and from following such occupations, as those of barber and washer- man, which concern the food, drink, and clothing of the people generally, quite apart from the dread of a possible infec- tion. Vagrant and indigent lepers living in the villages and scat- 2 C 2
?388 REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION tered about the country are probably sources of little or no danger. Disgust, and to a certain extent fear, rarely permit their relations to the general community to be intimate, and no harm is likely to result from their soliciting alms by the road- side. The tendency at the present time, however, is for men- dicant lepers to leave their homes, to crowd into the large cen- tres of population, and this in the opinion of the Commission should be discouraged. In the cities and towns they herd together, living under circumstances of extreme poverty and filth, and forming communities which are not only offensive to public decency, but constitute from many points of view a menace to the public health. Moreover, in such leper colonies promiscuous and casual alliances are the rule, and the result is that children are born to struggle for existence under circum- stances most painful to contemplate. The Commission consider that the best policy in dealing with this matter is to discourage this concentration of lepers in towns and cities, and to this end would suggest that municipal authorities be empowered to by-laws preventing vagrants suffering from loathsome diseases from begging in or frequenting places of public resort, or using public conveyances. The large Presidency towns and the capitals of provinces in many cases already possess leper asylums, which might be enlarged by municipal funds or private subscriptions. Asylums should be built near towns where they do not already exist, and the authorities should have the power of ordering lepers infringing the regulations either to return to their homes or to enter an asylum. Competent medical authority should always be consulted before action is taken under such by-laws. In no case would the Commissioners suggest an Imperial Act, especially directed against lepers as such, for these are far less dangerous to a community than insane or syphilitic people.
?Conclusions and Practical Suggestions. 389 The effect of such bye-laws in large towns would be an emigration into the surrounding country, and a furtherance of the scheme now to be proposed for establishing experimental leper colonies or farms in rural districts. The experiment of the leper farm in Cyprus5 has succeed- ed. Though unwilling to argue from a small island to a large empire, the Commission are of opinion that the success of leper colonies, such as that of Sialkot, which is isolated in the centre of a large agricultural district, and where lepers with their wives and families cultivate the soil, leads to the belief that similar farms scattered over the country would be productive of prac- tical good. Land might be granted, cheap buildings raised, seeds dis- tributed,' and work supplied. The produce might partially support the colony, and a small fixed money allowance might be given, or a small bounty be paid on the produce raised by each leper. Comparatively few children would be born, and these should, if possible, be removed to Orphanages. Only a certain number of the latter would be required, as the inmates might be discharged as soon as they were old enough to support themselves. The advantages of such a method are fully illus- trated in the Almora Orphanage. In conclusion, the Commissioners believe, from the consi- derations and arguments adduced in the foregoing report, that neither compulsory nor voluntary segregation would at present effectually stamp out the disease, or even markedly diminish the leper population, under the existing conditions of life in India. It can only be hoped that by means of improved sanitation and good dietetic conditions a diminution of leprosy will result. The Commission agree with most authorities in believing that the decline of leprosy in Europe has been due (5) Dr. Heidenstam, C.M.G. Report on Leprosy in Cyprus, 1890, page 13.

In the interests of the investigation, one section of the Commission commenced enquiries at Almora, while the other began work at Simla. Subsequently, when the two sections of the Commission met, it was found that the enquiry had proceeded so far that it would be preferable to continue experiments separately, especially as there was not sufficient room in the laboratory erected by the Government of India at Simla for the entire Commission to work together with facility. The two sections met at intervals, compared their observations, and discussed details of their work. Each Appendix conse- quently represents independent observations for which each section is separately responsible.

?Appendix I.                                     393 The following is a record of Laboratory work which was done at Almora and Simla by Drs. Rake, Buckmaster, and Surgeon-Major Thomson. I.-THE BACILLUS LEPR. The microscopical examination of the pathological neoplasms or tubercles which are characteristic of one form of leprosy was first made by Virchow in 1859.1 The appearances presented by the nerves in the ansthetic form are also figured by the same observer. In both these forms of the disease typical nucleated lepra-cells were seen which contained granular matter. Vandyke Carter by his re- searches, carried on independently in Bombay, constantly found these specific structural elements present in leprosy,2 and Klebs3 in 1873 drew attention to the fact "that in freshly extirpated tubercles, groups of bacteria, which in form and arrangement totally differed from those met with in other diseases, could be seen without diffi- culty." Armauer Hansen in 1868 and 1873 described movable rod- shaped bodies in fresh tubercles, and yellow spherical masses which possibly were zoogla masses in older ones. In 1880 the Nor- wegian observer, who during the preceding seven years had shown his preparations to numbers of medical men, published a record of his experiments and observations accompanied with figures, in which the granular masses within the lepra-cells were shown to be heaps of bacilli.4 At this period the work of Koch5 and Weigert,6 which is the foundation of scientific bacteriological method, was all but un- known, and with the exception of the Bacillus Anthracis 7 and some ill-defined bacteria connected with Pymia and Septicmia,8 scarcely a single definite pathogenic organism had been discovered.9 Among (1) Die Krankhaften Geschwlste, Bd. 11, p. 494.

?394 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: the great number of observers who have verified the accuracy of Hansen's discovery, the work of Neisser, who by the aid of the Koch-Weigert methods, placed this discovery beyond question, must be mentioned. 10 Sufficient time has now passed for it to be possible to confidently affirm that the presence of the Bacillus Lepr in the new growths of leprosy is absolutely characteristic of the disease. Indeed, this bacillus has a specific relationship in the causation of leprosy. No leper is free from this organism, and in the bodies of those suffering from other diseases it never occurs. For these reasons the Bacillus Lepr has been a subject of much study to those who have concerned themselves with the disease, and the most important results which are at present known will be briefly given. The Bacillus Lepr is a rod-like parasite, the length of which is onehalf to three-quarters the diameter of a human red blood-disc;11 in breadth about one-fifth of the length. It is straight, or slightly bent, with extremities that are pointed or slightly round. The bacil- lus possesses a protoplasmic content, in which clear spaces may at times be seen (endogenous spores?), surrounded by a delicate mem- brane. According to De Bary this membrane is only the most com- pact internal layer of a hull of material which may swell up, take a gelatinous character, and form an envelope to the bacillus. With certain reagents, such as iodine solution, the coherent rod may pre- sent the appearance of a row of minute spheres or cocci (kokkothrix). Whether these, morphologically, are true sphrobacteria or only a granular thread is uncertain. This appearance can also be produced by treatment with strong sulphuric acid, by staining with borax- methyl-blue and subsequent decolorisation in water or alcohol, and further by staining with hmatoxylin or osmic acid. Neisser 12 holds the view that the Bacillus Lepr is rod-shaped and possesses a hull, the innermost layer of which retains such a stain as fuchsin better than the outer layers, and this obscures the finer structure of the bacillus. The same observer states that the contents of a bacillus are (1) highly refracting oval spores; (2) ordinary protoplasm which scarcely stains at all, or if it does is easily bleached by acids; (3) granules. These latter become visible under the influence of the reagents mentioned above and give rise to the kokkothrix aspect. (10) Breslauer Aeiztl.

?Appendix I.                                     395 The bacillus has been described as both motile and non-motile, pos- sibly this is true for young and old bacilli respectively. The baciiius multiplies by fission; a bacillus grows to a certain length and then divides into two, and the process is repeated. Isolated spores which have become free have never yet been seen. In form and size Bacillus Lepr greatly resembles Bacillus Tu- berculosis. A distinction is considered to exist between these in their behaviour to staining reagents, and this rests upon a micro- chemical reaction dependent upon the behaviour of the investing membrane of the bacillus towards acids, alkalies, and aniline dyes.13 The staining procedure employed as diagnostic of the Bacillus Lepr is as follows: 1st, treatment of the section of tissue, or film fixed upon a cover-glass, with warm Ziehl's solution 14 for twelve minutes; 2nd, decolorisation of the specimen in 25 per cent. nitric acid; 3rd, wash- ing in 60 per cent. alcohol; 4th, washing in distilled water. Cover- glass specimens are at once examined in water, or after drying, in xylol-balsam. Sections are treated with absolute alcohol and removed to bergamot oil before mounting in balsam. A saturated solution of acetate of potash is the best medium in which to mount specimens, as the colour disappears less rapidly. The Bacillus Tuberculosis is not stained by so short an immersion in Ziehl's solution, and all other bacilli that were stained would have been wholly decolorised by the acid, while the Bacilli Lepr resist this bleaching15 and stand out in the field of the microscope as bright red rods (Baumgarten). The following also stain well by the above method and exhibit a resistance to strong mineral acids which is almost as great as that shown by Tubercle and Leprosy Bacilli; (1) keratin tissue; (2) the spores of a large kind of bacillus found in the intestinal canal and described by Koch; (3) the spores of mucor; (4) certain pseudo- bacilli figured by Celli and Guarnieri which are probably crystals of fatty acid; (5) the Syphilis, or Smegma Bacillus, which to some (13) Ehrlich's early papers are in Zeitschrift f. klin. Med. Bd. I, 1880; Ibidem Bd. II, 1881; Deutsch. Med. Wochen. 1882, No. 19; Charit Annalen 1886. The views of Ehrlich with reference to the behaviour of Bacillus Lepr and Bacillus Tuberculosis towards aniline dyes and also to acids, are, that, firstly, the membrane of these bacilli is only slightly permea- ble to acids; and, secondly, that the acid chemically changes this membrane, so that the colour held by the protoplasm cannot diffuse outwards. The value of the addition of alkalies, aniline or phenol to the dye depends upon the facts that the membrane becomes more permeable, and a true combination of these reagents with the dye ensures a more brilliant staining effect. (14) Water 100 cub. cent.; Crystallized Carbolic Acid 5 grammes; Alcohol 10 cub. cent.; Fuchsin 1 gramme (Ziehl-Neelsen). (15) As a fact, the bacilli do lose their colour wholly or in part in the acid, but regain it in the treatment with alcohol and water. A piece of silk treated with aqeous methyl-violet simi- larly reacts by losing colour in acid and recovering this in water.
?396 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: extent behaves similarly, due to the presence of a hull of fatty material. Leprosy Bacilli may also be differentiated from those of Tubercle by treatment with potash solution 1 : 12. The bacilli appear as clear rather thick rods. If a drop of watery methyl-violet be now added to the specimen, only the Bacillus Lepr stains, while the other remains colourless (Baumgarten). However, the Bacillus Tuberculosis can also be stained with watery aniline dyes 16 and the Bacillus Lepr with alkaline methyl-blue. 17 The method with Bor- fuchsin 18 has not succeeded in our hands; the Leprosy Bacilli re- mained stained. The staining behaviour of Bacillus Lepr, according to Neisser,19 may be summarised briefly as follows: fuchsin, gentian and methyl-violet, dahlia, especially in weak acid solution, stain the bacillus well; methylene-blue, nigrosin, aurantia, methyl-green and eosin have no staining effect; Bismarck brown does not stain whether in acid or alkaline solution, though Koch has obtained a slight colo- ration with vesuvin. An eosin-alum-hmatoxylin solution (Ehrlich) stains the nuclei of tissues blue, the cell protoplasm rose, and the bacilli orange. The coloration of the bacilli is always less than that shown by micrococci, and at times the colour disappears in a day or so. The methods of Khne and Unna having reference chiefly to the manner of disposition of the bacilli within the tissues and organs of the body, have not been employed by us. Gram's method stains the bacilli well, and the kokkothrix appearance is admirably seen. Though the work of Weigert, Ehrlich, Khne, Unna and others has to some extent changed the technology of staining from an empirical to a scientific basis, much is still required before a definite staining procedure can be considered as a definite micro-chemical reaction. At present the differential diagnostic method for the Bacillus Lepr and Bacillus Tuberculosis given above is generally recognized as the best means for detection of the Leprosy Bacillus; but it may be considered an open question whether this is absolute. The grouping of the bacilli in clumps in cells of specific shape and (16) Baumgarten, Path. Mykologie, Vol. II, page 645. Wesener, Centralbl. f. Bac. u. Parasit, Vol. II, 1887.

?Appendix I.                                     397 structure 20 is, however, characteristic of the Bacillus Lepr within the tissues of the body. This aggregation may be due to the nature of the hull of the bacillus, for though, according to Lutz and Unna, the Bacillus Tuberculosis possesses a similar hull, this is rarely grouped into heaps, and even the arrangement within giant cells in no way resembles the grouping that is presented by the Bacillus Lepr. Bacilli which have been in alcohol stain better than when seen in fluid just expressed from a tubercle. A very prolonged treatment with warm Ziehl's solution will also enable bacilli, other than Bacillus Lepr or Bacillus Tuberculosis, to resist the effect of acids. Masses of micrococci also retain the stain. Spina's statement21 that putrefac- tive bacteria treated with 2 per cent. tannin stain like the above bacilli we did not succeed in confirming. II.-DISTRIBUTION OF THE LEPROSY BACILLUS WITHIN THE BODY. In the absence of autopsies this subject could not be dealt with as fully as might have been wished. From the records of various observers, it is however by this time well known that the bacillus of leprosy has been found in most of the tissues and viscera of the body, though it occurs in some, such as the liver and spleen, far more frequently than in others, such as the kidney and brain. Observations on the following fluids, secretions, and excretions of the body were made as opportunity offered at Almora, Simla, and Hyderabad. Fluids.  Blood. Juice from leprous tubercle. Blister fluid. Discharge from leprous ulcer. Material from thickened nerve.  Secretions.  Saliva. Vaginal mucus. Excretions.  Urine. Sputum. Fces. Menstrual discharge. (20) With the question whether the bacilli are within cells, or collected into groups lying exterior to these, we have not concerned ourselves. The latter view which is held by Unna and exhibited by his "Trocken Methode " is also that of Khne. The iodine-pararosaniline- method also shows the rod-like bacilli to be a coccus series, similar to that figured by Zopf for Bacillus Tuberculosis (vide Die Spaltpilze). (21) Quoted by Stricker in Infectionskrankheiten.
?398 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: FLUIDS. Blood. Kbner is the only pathologist who claims to have found Leprosy Bacilli in the blood. All other observers have failed, even during acute outbreaks of the disease, and it may fairly be doubted if the bacillus can live in the blood. Twenty-three cover-glasses prepared from blood obtained from six lepers failed in any case to show Leprosy Bacilli. It is worthy of note that even where the blood was obtained by section of a tubercle, the results were negative. The following table shows the results of examination of .blood :-     No. Name. AGE.

?Appendix I. 399 Blister Fluid. The observations and experiments made on blister fluid are fully explained in another part of the report, for it was by the application of blisters over tubercles that it appeared possible to separate living Leprosy Bacilli from the tissues, and subsequently to grow them in blister serum and other media. Little more than an enumeration of the observations need, therefore, be here given. The subjoined table shows that blisters on various parts of the body were raised on five different patients. Fifty-nine cover-glasses were prepared, and of these, nine specimens from three different patients showed Leprosy Bacilli in greater or less quantities. It must be noted that all these positive cases were in fluid obtained from blisters over actual tubercles.

It may safely be affirmed that Leprosy Bacilli are always found in cutaneous and other tubercles at some period or other of their existence. The failure to find them is due either to error of preparation or observation, to the fact that no bacilli have happened to be express- ed on to the cover-glass, or to the fact that the tubercle is old and degenerating, and the bacilli are consequently dead. That it is not always easy to obtain bacilli from leprous tubercles, is shown by the observations recorded above that no bacilli were found in blood from tuberculated tissue. Evidently more than simple section of the tubercle is usually required to extract the bacilli. Compression must 2 D
?402 APPRNDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION : also be employed as recommended by Manson, or the blister method detailed above. So well known is the association of bacilli with leprous tubercles, that it was hardly considered necessary to make observations on this point. Such as were made were for the purpose of controlling other work, such as blister or inoculation experiments. The results are given in the next table, and it will be seen that only three observations absolutely failed to show them, while in another they were doubtful. No. Name. AGE. Form. Years afflicted.

In the discharge from tuberculated ulcers Leprosy Bacilli, both free and in cells, are more beautifully brought out by staining than perhaps in any other fluid or tissue. Whether it is that the bacilli in
?Appendix I. 403 this discharge have been so macerated as to be divested of their mucin-like hull is a question, but the fact remains. In the discharge from ansthetic ulcers, on the other hand, they could not be found. At Almora an experiment was made in which a leper washed his tuberculated and ulcerated feet in a basin of water. Examination of cover-glass preparations from this water showed Leprosy Bacilli in every specimen. The experiment was repeated at Simla with like results, but plate cultivations from this water failed to produce any colonies of Leprosy Bacilli. It is possible to argue from these experiments  that though the bacilli are thrown off in great numbers from tuberculated ulcers, they are not living. It must, however, be remembered  that discharges from open ulcers are so full of microbes of every description, that the Leprosy Bacillus, which does not grow rapidly or very vigorously, might easily be over powered in the struggle  for existence with other organisms.

?404 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Material from thickened nerve. Four cover-glass preparations from a leprous ulnar nerve, operated on by Surgeon-Major Lawrie at Hyderabad, were examined, but no bacilli were found. Comparatively little value can, however, be attached to this observation, for bacilli in leprous nerves often escape notice unless sections are made. This, of course, was impracticable in the above case. SECRETIONS. Saliva. In many of the cases in which bacilli were found in the saliva, the tongue was tuberculated and in some cases ulcerated. It is, therefore, not a matter of surprise that bacilli should be present in this secretion. Indeed, so frequently and rapidly do leprous tubercles of the tongue, throat, and larynx ulcerate, that the wonder is that bacilli are not more frequently found in saliva. The following table shows the number of specimens of saliva examined, and it will be seen that in only eight out of twenty-two observations were characteristic bacilli seen :- No. Name. AGE. From.

Cook kindly sent specimens from two cases in the M adras Asylum. The first specimen was taken on 24th June, 1891, from a patient, aged 16, suffering from mixed leprosy. Ten cover-glass preparations were examined on 17th July, 1891, and showed an immense number of decolorised bacilli with a few faintly stained ones. There were also staphylococci and beaded rods, sometimes stained pink. In one specimen were a few spore-bearing bacilli, the spores being a deep red. There were no undoubted Leprosy Bacilli. The second specimen was taken on 24th June, 1891, from a tuberculated leper, aged 18. Ten cover-glasses were examined on 17th July, 1891, and showed numerous staphylococci, isolated bacteria, and micrococci. In one specimen was a mass of six or seven highly stained short rods which were possibly Leprosy Bacilli.
?406 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: Leprosy Bacilli have been described in vaginal secretion by one or two observers (Kalindero and Babs). The bearing of these observations on the question of inoculability of leprosy is obvious. Excretions. Urine. The urine of six lepers was examined, two of them being mixed cases, three ansthetic, and one tuberculated. Four cover-glasses from each case were taken, making twenty-four observations in all. In no case were Leprosy Bacilli found. This is not surprising, for very rarely are Leprosy Bacilli found in kidneys examined after death. The results obtained from urine are given below :- No. Name.

Fces. This excretion was examined in five lepers, two ansthetic, two mixed, and one tuberculated. Sixteen cover-glass preparations were made, and in one from a mixed case Leprosy Bacilli were found. In this patient, however, bacilli had previously been found in the saliva, so that it was quite possible to expect to find them in the fces.

Five of the cases were mixed, and one tuberculated. All the patients had raucous voices, indicating leprous infiltration of the larynx. It was therefore to be expected that bacilli would be found in the sputum. It appears to us that it is absolutely impossible to confuse Leprous and Tubercular sputum. In the former case isolated bacilli are very rarely seen, but large typical cells filled with bacilli, to such an extent that it is difficult to recognize them individually, abound in advanced cases. In the absence of autopsies during the laboratory work, we are unable to speak definitely as to the existence of leprous phthisis. Leprosy Bacilli were present in four (22) Koch, Mit. a. d. Kaiser.

This was sent by Dr. Cook from Madras. The first specimen was from an ansthetic leper, aged 40. It was taken on June 28, and examined on July 17, 1891. Ten cover-glasses were prepared, and all gave negative results. The second specimen was from a patient, aged 19, suffering from mixed leprosy. It was taken on June 27, and examined on July 17, 1891. Ten cover-glasses showed shreds of epithelium, bacteria, mi- crococci, but no Leprosy Bacilli. These results are similar to those obtained from vaginal mucus. III.-DISTRIBUTION OF THE LEPROSY BACILLUS OUTSIDE THE BODY. Little is yet known of the natural history of the Leprosy Bacillus outside the human body. Arning23 claims to have found it in the (23) Report on Leprosy in Hawaii, 1886.
?Appendix I.                                     409 earth of a leper's grave in Hawaii, but failed to find it in mosquitoes which had sucked the blood of lepers. Kaurin24 failed to find it in earth and in the dust and air of rooms inhabited by lepers. Observa- tions in Trinidad failed to show the bacillus in the earth of the asylum cemetery, or in salt fish, salt pork, or urhur dal (Cytisus cajan).25 The attention of the Commission in India was chiefly directed to the following possible habitats of the bacillus outside the human body :- Earth. Fish and crustacea. Water. Flies.  Earth. The occurrence of Leprosy Bacilli in earth has already been refer- red to in the paper on contagion. It will be sufficient to repeat here that a hundred cover-glass preparations were made from earth taken from four of the most likely sites for Leprosy Bacilli within the Almora Asylum compound. Only ten bacilli were found in all these observa- tions, and they occurred on seven cover-glasses. Gelatine plates in- oculated from this earth failed to show any colonies of Leprosy Bacilli. It will be seen from the table given below that the number of bacilli to be found in earth habitually trodden by lepers is extremely small, and it is open to doubt whether the few bacilli found were alive.

?410 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION. Water. The readiness with which Leprosy Bacilli can be washed out of tuberculated ulcers and detected in basins or other vessels of water has been shown in the preceding section. The object of the present inquiry is to ascertain whether these bacilli can be found distributed in larger collections of water. For this purpose water was examined from the Almora Leper Asylum and also from the holy tank at Tarn Taran Leper Asylum. This tank is stagnant and overgrown with alg, and if Leprosy Bacilli are found anywhere in water, they ought to be present here, for this tank is supposed to have remarkable healing properties, and lepers are constantly in the habit of bathing in the water, and swimming through it in the hope of getting rid of their disease. An examination of fifty cover-glasses prepared from this water failed, however, to show any unequivocal Leprosy Bacilli. Four of the specimens gave several short pink rods closely resembling the bacilli sought for, but after careful and repeated examination by different members of the Commission, it was finally decided that they could not be regarded as Leprosy Bacilli. The following table shows the observations made on water:- Source of Water. No. of cover-glasses. Result of Microscopic Examination. 1. Water from tank at Almora Asy lum, used for supplying bathroom. 2 1, 2. No Leprosy Bacilli. 2. Water from puddle outside   spring of drinking water often visited by lepers. 2 1, 2. Debris. No Leprosy Bacilli. 3. Water from tank in which lepers  bathe at Tarn Taran Asylum. 50  1 to 50. No positive Leprosy Bacilli.   Four specimens showed very suspicious rods taking pink stain.  Fish and Crustacea.  A full discussion of the fish theory is given in the chapter on food in relation to leprosy. Though, as will be seen in that part of the report abundant evidence unfavourable to this theory was collected
?Appendix I.                                     411 in the Punjab, and the Asylums of Almora and Dehra Dun, still it was thought that the laboratory work ought to include the examin- ation of as many varieties of fish and crustacea as possible. For this purpose five different varieties of nga-pi were collected while part of the Commission was travelling in Burma, and specimens of dried fish and shrimps were kindly sent from Darjeeling by Surgeon-Major O'Brien. Numerous species of dried and fresh fish, with some shrimps and crabs, were also obtained from Bombay through the kindness of Dr. J. H. Choksy, and these were supplemented with a few recent specimens of fresh-water fish from the neighbourhood of Simla. It was considered advisable to examine fish from Darjeeling, for some members of the Commission when making enquiries in this station found to their surprise that dried fish was consumed by almost every native inhabitant. The expenditure of a trifling sum was sufficient to procure enough dried fish for a month, and this was eaten with each meal more as a condiment, like the nga-pi in Burma, than as a food. Though leprosy is not unduly prevalent in Darjeeling, still it was thought that an examination of the article of diet in question derived from a locality presenting the unusual feature of a hill district where fish is almost universally consumed, would not be without interest. Two hundred coverglass preparations were made from five varieties of nga-pi, and nineteen species of fish and crustacea, and the material was most carefully stained and examined, but in no case could Leprosy Bacilli be found. As might have been expected, numerous bacteria and other micro-organisms were present, and it is noteworthy that these in most instances retained the pink stain. This only serves to emphasise the fact which has been remarked elsewhere in this report that the staining reaction is after all only of partial importance in diagnosing different bacilli. The results are given in the appended short table. Unfortunately the species of the various fish and crustacea could not be determined, but this is of less importance since the results were negative.

?Appendix I.                                413 Flies. The part played by flies in the spread of certain diseases has been recognised for some time, and it seems reasonable to suppose that they may be capable of conveying the Leprosy Bacillus. An op- portunity of putting this to the test occurred at the Almora Asylum. Three lepers were caused to sit on the ground and expose the tuber- culated ulcers of their feet. These were soon visited in large num- ber by common house flies, which settled on the ulcers, and fed on the discharges. Several of these flies were caught on the ulcers, their abdomens were opened and cover-glass preparations were made of the intestine and contents. No Leprosy Bacilli could be detected in the flies, though the discharge on which they were feeding was shown in two of the lepers to be rich in Leprosy Bacilli. Indeed, the third leper had been proved to have numerous bacilli in other parts of his body, though by an oversight these particular ulcers were not examined. Only ten cover-glasses were prepared from ten flies, and it is quite possible that a more extended series of observations might show Leprosy Bacilli. Still considering the immense quantities of Leprosy Bacilli found in the discharge from these tuberculated ulcers, it is strange that they are not more readily discoverable in flies which have fed on these discharges.

IV.-VACCINATION. Of late years much attention has been directed to the possibility of infecting persons with leprosy through vaccination. Gairdner in
?414 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: 1887 published a case, in which a doctor in a tropical island vaccin- ated his own child from a native child who afterwards became leprous. Another white child was vaccinated from the doctor's child, and both these children also developed leprosy. The case excited much interest, and many people assumed that it proved the possible transmission of leprosy by vaccination. A perusal of the case, how- ever, shows that the details are very few and insufficient to establish any conclusion. Moreover, leprosy was endemic in the island, so that the possibility of infection from outside sources was always present. Direct experiments bearing on the subject have not been want- ing. Arning in Hawaii vaccinated lepers and examined the lymph. He found bacilli in the vesicles raised in cases of extensive tubercul- ated leprosy in which the skin contained bacilli. In cases of pure ansthetic leprosy he found no bacilli. A series of observations made in the Trinidad Asylum on vesicles raised on tuberculated, ansthetic, and mixed lepers failed to show any Leprosy Bacilli, and animals vaccinated with lymph from these vesicles did not develop leprosy. Daubler's observations27 refer to two women on Robben Island,28 aged 15 and 35 years, respectively, both of whom he believed con- tracted leprosy through vaccination. Both individuals were vaccin- ated with the lymph obtained from a patient who subsequently died of tubercular leprosy. In the first patient the site of inoculation swelled a few days after the puncture and had a brown hue, but no true vaccine vesicle formed. Subsequently after the swelling had subsided, fever and rigors occurred, and by the eighteenth week swelling and discoloring of the right frontal eminence was seen. The second patient, two months after the vaccination, showed the typical leonine aspect of a tuberculated leper. These cases are fre- quently quoted, but Arning's experiments, which are in complete accordance with the clinical experience of all observers, do not permit of the belief that such an essentially chronic disease as leprosy is pro- duced so soon after inoculation. Quite recently Dr. Simpson has vaccinated lepers in Calcutta, and claims to have found Leprosy Bacilli in the vaccine lymph. In view of these conflicting statements, it seemed that further and (27) Daubler, Ueber Lepra und deren Contagiositt., Monat fr prakt. Dermat. Bd. VIII, 1889, p. 123.

?Appendix I.                                   415 more numerous observations on vaccine lymph taken from lepers would be of value. A suitable opportunity occurred at the Almora Asylum, where all the lepers who were well enough were vaccinated, amounting to some eighty-seven in all. Of these forty (twenty-one males, nineteen females) developed vesicles, which were examined. Of the forty cases, thirty-four were ansthetic, five mixed, and one was tuberculated. The condition of the skin where vaccinated was as follows:- In 14 cases it was normal. ,, 13 ,, there was an ansthetic patch. ,, 12    ,, sensation was diminished. ,, 1  case it was tuberculated. The condition of the vesicle was as follows:- In 31 cases normal. ,,     2 ,, purulent. ,,    2 ,, purulent and mixed with blood. ,,    1 case normal one arm and purulent on the other. ,,    1 ,, normal, but mixed with blood in taking. ,,    1 ,, immature. ,,    1 ,, immature and mixed with blood in taking. ,,    1 ,, immature and the crust taken. Crusts also were taken from two vicleses which had been normal. Ninety-three cover-glasses were prepared and stained with Ziehl's solution, passed through acid and then treated with methyl-blue. In no case were Leprosy Bacilli found. Suspicious-looking rods taking fuchsin were found in one case in vesicles raised over tuberculated ears, and in another case in vesicles over ansthetic patches. But even if these cases be considered as positive, and the utmost value allowed to them, they would have little or no importance in the question at issue, for no vaccinator would be likely to vaccinate a leper over a tubercle or ansthetic patch, and use the lymph obtained from such vesicles for vaccinating healthy individuals. It is therefore our opinion that assuming the presence of the bacillus to be necessary to produce leprosy, this series of observa- tions, which is the most extensive yet made, conclusively shows that no danger need be apprehended from the vaccine lymph of even an actual leper, provided he has been vaccinated on normal skin.  fortiori, therefore, there is no danger of transmitting leprosy by using as a vaccinifer a child born of a family in which leprosy exists provided reasonable care be taken.

V.-CULTIVATION EXPERIMENTS. 29 Hansen, in his original paper, described both rod-formed bodies (Bacillus Lepr) in tubercles, and jointed threads obtained in speci- mens of blood which, when kept in a moist chamber, developed into a mycelial growth, as probable specific microscopical features of true leprosy. He also figured these granular mycelial masses, and spoke of them as a culture, but it is almost certain that this must be looked upon as a contamination of the specimen, and since the Bacillus Lepr never occurs in blood, this growth could not have been a deve- lopment of these. It is clear also that Hansen himself did not regard the mycelium in this light. The cultivation experiments of Neisser30 are the earliest, and the details may be given in his own words. I. An unbroken tubercle was thoroughly cleansed with alcohol, then removed with every possible precaution against foreign infection, and finely divided up with needles made sterile in a flame. Particles of this broken up material were employed in the following three culture methods :- (a) With blood serum in hollow-ground microscope slides. The hollow spaces were very capacious and contained much air. (29) The references available in India for this section are exceelingly few. (30) Virchovw's Archiv. 1881, 1886.
?Appendix I.                                  421 (b) In test tubes, carefully cleansed by heat and acids, which were partly filled with blood serum or with alkaline steri- lized flesh-extract-solution. (c) Under cover-glasses with blood serum, in a space where evaporation was checked. All these preparations were kept permanently in a warm chamber at 35-39C. 2. Cultivations from pus and juice of leprous nodule which were protected in capillary glass tubes from accidental fouling. The tubes contained much air and were sealed. Neisser describes three bacilli: first, movable rods which are perfectly free from distortion of any kind; second, motile rods with a minute ball-like swelling at one or both extremities or in the middle; these rods are somewhat longer than the first variety and frequently sharply bent; third, bacilli which are characterised by being distinctly longer and broader than either the first or second kind; each of these rods contains one to four clear unstained spaces (vacuolation). It is possible, according to this observer, that the breaking up of the rod into granules (kokkothrix) which lie in a row adhering together because of the hull which invests the bacillus, is a retrogressive metamorphosis, and that the bacilli of the second and third kinds exhibit veritable spore-formation. Lastly, both in cultures and in microscopical preparations of leprous tubercles which, after experimental introduction, had been encapsuled in the peritoneal cavity, the bacilli grew into a thread occasionally four times the normal length, but in these no sign of anything which could be called a spore-formation was evident. From a careful examination of Neisser's figures, especially 1 and 10, it appears not unlikely that, as he claims, a veritable culture was obtained. Further, the three kinds of bacilli described by him are to be seen in juice from a leper tubercle. Of the actual existence of two-the first and third kinds-there can be no question, but the relation of these to each other is not so clear; both stain excellently with the Koch-Ehrlich method and resist decolorization with acids; and also Gram's method clearly defines both of them, especially the latter. Neisser's first kind is the normal Bacillus Lepr; the second we believe to be possibly a distortion, for a swelling upon a rod can easily be caused to appear and disappear, as the bacillus slowly turns under the cover-glass; and the appearance seen is figured on Plate III, Fig. VIII; the third form, as far as we can judge from his Figs 7 and 13, we have frequently seen and have also, we believe, cultiva- ted. Whether it is a bacillus possessing pathogenic power it is impossible to say. This form, which it is very probable is the same
?422 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: as that described by Neisser, we shall speak of as the vacuolated bacillus In a later paper Neisser,31 as the result of extended obser- vations, inclines to the view that the vacuoles, or spaces in the bacillus, are veritable spores, though in no instance has he seen an isolated spore. The ball-like swelling in the second kind he does not regard as a spore-formation. He also confirms the presence of the hull of the bacillus, stating that it can easily be seen after staining a preparation with watery dye. The presence of this hull is botanically of interest; it occurs also in the Bacillus Tuberculosis,32 Pneumococ- cus,33 and several other forms. Further culture experiments by Neisser consisted in using solid blood serum and hard-boiled fowl or duck eggs as a nutrient medium, and minute pieces of excised tubercle, or blood from a tubercle, as material for inoculation. The culture was maintained at a tempera- ture of 37-38C. The growth was exceedingly slow. Cultivation in generations was not successful. Specimens from detached bacillary islets on the medium yielded what the author held to be a genuine cultivation of the Bacillus Lepr. Hansen 34 in 1882 described a culture on serum of bacilli which were motile. He used methylene-blue as a stain, but according to Neisser this will not even tinge the genuine Bacillus Lepr. This is not a strong argument against Hansen's culture, for in our hands methyl-blue stains the Bacillus Lepr, though great differences exist in the samples of this dye, so that the discordant results of various observers are conceivable. It is impossible to be quite certain that a veritable cultivation of the Bacillus Lepr was obtained by Neisser. On Plate XII,34 Figs. 1, 5, 6, and especially 10, have the appearance of true cultures, but when it is considered that this observer wholly failed to cultivate the bacillus in generations, an actual multiplication in fluids which pro- bably did occur is all that can be conceded. Manson,35 some years before Hansen had discovered the Bacillus Lepr, attempted by incubation of leper juice to discover the then unknown germ. Sealed capillary tubes were inserted into eggs which were placed under a hen. Beyond the development of streptococci, both free and in the zoogla state, these experiments gave wholly negative results. (31) Virchow's Archiv. 1886. (32) Lutz and Unna. Dermatol.

?Appendix I.                                  423 Arning 36 states "that there is no difficulty whatever in growing the Leprosy Bacillus, by simply allowing pieces of leprous tissue to macerate in ordinary water, at ordinary temperatures, giving but sufficient time; but the resulting growths are not pure cultures in a strict sense." The introduction by Koch of solid nutrient media has, to a large extent, caused nearly all observers who have attempted to cultivate the Bacillus Lepr to abandon cultivation in fluid media which in the hands of Pasteur had led to many discoveries. In the history of the attempted cultivation of the specific bacillus of leprosy, the great majority of experiments have consisted in the removal of a piece of leprous tubercle and the direct implantation of this upon a solid nutrient surface, such as agar, glycerin agar, or solidified serum.37 The successful growth of Bacillus Tuberculosis by this method is by no means easy, and uniformly negative results with the Bacillus Lepr have been obtained by the vast majority of observers.38 Quite recently Sheridan Delpine and Slater39 record numerous attempts to cultivate the bacillus, which were made independently at two different periods during the life of the patient. On both occasions the results were negative. The latter observer two years previously had attempted identical cultivation experiments. In 188740 Bordoni-Uffreduzzi described at length his culture- experiments with the Bacillus Lepr. He was as unsucessful as previous observers in the direct implantation of a leprous nodule on to a solid nutrient medium. The chief result of such a proceeding was a growth of Streptococcus Pyogenes. He considered that the Leprosy Bacilli which abound in leprous nodules are enclosed in cells, and probably are not alive, though, if the view of Unna and Khne be accepted, the bacillary heaps lie outside the cells. In the marrow of bones of a dead leper, the Italian observer found free bacilli, and from this material he raised cultivations of the Bacillus Lepr on peptone-salt, glycerine-serum; it grows also upon glycerine- agar. However, the bone-marrow has been examined by Kaurin 41 in many cases, and he never succeeded in finding the Bacillus Lepr. It does not appear that many observations on bone-marrow have been made, but at any rate in the Haversian canals and spaces of the (36) Journal of the Leprosy Investigation Committee, No. 2, p. 117. (37) Fraenkel and Franke repeatedly failed to cultivate the Xerosis Bacillus in this manner by direct implantation on solid media. Schreiber, however, succeeded in this direction.

?424 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: bones of the little finger, which presented typical mutilation, masses of bacilli, both discrete, and lodged within undoubted lepra cells, have been found by Delpine and Slater.42 Sawtschenko 43 has also worked out the histology of bone-leprosis. Bordoni-Uffreduzzi describes the cultivated bacillus on peptone- glycerine serum at a temperature of 35-37C. as a light-yellow tnia-form stripe with irregular edges along the needle-track. The serum is never liquefied, and no growth ever occurs in the condensa- tion water. On glycerine-agar a similar culture develops if a great quantity of bacillary material be streaked upon the nutrient surface. If a smaller amount be streaked, isolated lens formed colonies with jagged edges and of varying size develop. On glycerine-agar plates, both on the surface and deeply in the medium, colonies may be seen with a power of 100 diameters, which are grey, net-like growths with irregular edges. It is evident that this growth cannot be confounded with cultures of Bacillus Tuberculosis. The isolated bacilli in form and measurement resemble those of the tissues, but a striking pecu- liarity is the frequent occurrence, at one or both ends of a bacillus, of a swelling in which an arthrospore may be seen. This appearance may also be recognised in the tissues, but it is an open question whether this does not represent an involution-form. Isolated spores, or the development of a rod from such an arthrospore, have not been observed. The bacillus is quite immotile. The tinctorial behaviour of the cultivated Bacillus Lepr is characterised, firstly, by remaining absolutely unstained by alkaline methyl-blue,44 in which it resembles the bacillus of the tissues, and secondly, by staining with much greater difficulty in Ehrlich's fuchsin, indeed, with about the same facility as the Bacillus Tuberculosis does. The Bacillus Lepr of the tissues, however, stains much more readily than the latter. In a great number of experiments on rabbits and other animals, Bordoni-Uffre- duzzi wholly failed to establish the pathogenic nature of his cultiva- tion. Roux, Nocard, Chantemesse and Cornil45 have failed to confirm the above cultivation experiments, but Gianturco46 has succeeded in obtaining a culture which Bordoni-Uffreduzzi admits is absolutely (42) Loc. cit. (43) Sawtschenko ber Osteomyelitis Leprosa. Centralblatt. f. Bact. und Parasitenkunde Bd. V., 1889. According to Sawtschenko the vacuoles in lepra cells contain a liquid which is secreted by the bacilli. The absorption of bones proceeds from lepra clusters in the bone-marrow and in the dilated Haversian. canals. (44) Koch and Wesener have stained Bacillus Lepr, and this can be confirmed with great ease (45) Extr. du Bulletin de \ill\'Academie de Medicine. S ance du 19th Juin, 1888.

?Appendix I.                                     425 identical with his own. At a temperature of 37C., after seven days a colony is developed of feebly motile bacilli, which are more slender when grown on glycerine-blood-serum than when on glycerine-agar. The bacilli also possess terminal swellings (arthrospores). Both Campana47 and Katz 48 using every precaution, have failed to culti- vate the Bacillus Lepr. The former observer, in the course of two years, made about five hundred experiments and employed various nutrient media and material from leprous tubercle. In consequence of the total failure of these experiments he has thrown doubt on the genuineness of the culture obtained by Bordoni-Uffreduzzi. Extensive experiments which were made in Trinidad, with total want of success, and consisting in the direct implantation of the centre of a non-ulcerated leprous tubercle, taken with every possible precaution, upon a nutrient solid medium, were repeated in India with similar result. No culture was formed, but a staphylococcus growth spread very slowly from the piece of tissue, and by the end of ten weeks the implanted piece was obscured by this growth. The following methods were adopted in our experiments:- 1. It had been ascertained that in blisters raised over unbroken leprous tubercles, specific bacilli were frequently found. It is also well known that the pigment particles in tattoo-marks do not pass into such a fluid. It was therefore hoped that by this means a separ- ation could be effected between the living and dead bacilli within the tubercle. Serum from blisters over the normal skin of the back of a leper was received into sterile vaccine capillary tubes, and a small quantity of the fluid of a blister raised over a tubercle was added to this. The tube, which had an air-space for about one-third of its length, was then sealed and maintained at the temperature of the body. 2.  Pieces of the centre of a leprous tubercle, removed with all pos- sible precautions, were introduced into bouillon, and maintained at the temperature of the room, which during the day averaged 27C. 3.  An unbroken tubercle was thoroughly cleansed with carbolic soap and perchloride solution. A deep puncture with a sterile needle was made into the tubercle, and perfectly clear leper juice was ex- pressed. This was received into sterile pieces of capillary tube, about \ill\ long, and the tube and contents at once dropped into bouillon. This was maintained at the temperature of the room. In all the above instances microscopical examination showed that (47) Abstract in Baumgarten's Jahresbericht, Vol. III, 1889. (48) Abstract in Baumgarten's Jahresbericht., Vol. III.
?426 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: the material used as the source of cultures contained Leprosy Bacilli. The results of these three methods will now be given in detail. From what has been previously mentioned, it would appear that the direct implantation of leprous material upon solid nutrient media gives absolutely negative results. Among the causes of this it may be suggested that the Bacillius Lepr, like the bacillus of malignant dema,49 is exquisitely anerobic, or may be incapable of becoming a facultative saprophyte, or that in the preparation of the piece of leprous tissue, the hot knives used to make the section cause the formation of a layer of coagulated material, through which the bacilli cannot make their way, or, lastly, because the tissue contains for the most part, only dead bacilli. The last conjecture appears most probable, since the others admit of direct experiment. If a section of skin be made through a leprous tubercle the bacilli are found in quantities, and fluid expressed from the neoplasm abounds in bacilli. The epidermis from the corneous to the pigmentary layer in unbroken tubercles is wholly free from bacilli, while the cutis and subcutaneous tissue is crowded with them. A blister raised over a tubercle contains a few leucocytes and at times bacilli. In some cases these latter are absent. We believed that the majority of these bacilli were alive and capable of being cultivated. Cultivation Experiments with Blister Fluid. Blisters were raised over tubercles on the ears, face and wrists, and at the same time over normal skin between the shoulder blades. After avoiding all sources of fouling, sterilised vaccine capillary tubes were charged with a minute quantity of fluid from a blister over a tubercle, and also with seven or eight times the quantity of fluid from a blister over the normal skin of the same leper. They were then sealed. Each tube also contained air for about one-third of its length. The dates of these experiments ranged from March 31st to May 13th. In all cases samples of the blisters, both over the tubercles and on the back, were examined for the bacillus. Being at this time without an incubator, the tubes were packed with a small thermometer in a cylindrical box and carried in the axilla, a proceeding adopted by Spallanzani in the last century when studying the action of the diges- tive juices on food. A month later these tubes were examined and resealed, and in several cultures were seen. A tube containing a culture was now sterilised as far as was possible without injury to the (49) Discovered by Koch and first cultivated in bouillon with absence of oxygen by Pasteur.
?Appendix I.                                  427 contents, broken at both ends, and dropped into fluid glycerine-bouillon and shaken carefully. In this bouillon a culture of bacilli, which we believed to be Leprosy Bacilli for the reasons given below, developed, a slight turbidity occurred about the third day and a pellicle subse- quently formed on the surface, so that a good tenacious scum was produced by the twelfth day. In the mode of formation of this pellicle, minute particles appeared on the surface of the bouillon, which daily increasing in number, joined together, so that the whole growth could be seen steadily advancing from the centre to the peri- phery. In some cases, a fortnight later this pellicle sank partly in the fluid. From such original bouillon cultures, gelatine and glycerine- agar media were inoculated. The growth liquefied the gelatine and grew also well on agar. Generations up to the sixth were carried on at Simla from April 26th to August 20th, 1891. Out of about twenty- five experiments (some of which failed to give any culture in the capil- lary tube), the following may be given as examples:- 1. Blister fluid over the tubercle of Puniya, and fluid taken from a blister over normal skin of the back of same leper, mixed in a sealed capillary tube with an air space. Taken on April 14th, 1891, kept at body temperature until May 2nd, when part of the contents was examined. Leprosy Bacilli brightly stained were found. The tube was resealed, and on May 14th this was broken and dropped into bouillon. The tubes were kept at a temperature of 26C. On May 25th a minute white speck was seen floating on the surface of the liquid. Two days later, a thin film, most dense in the centre, almost covered the surface of the liquid. A small amount of this film subsided to the bottom of the test tube. Microscopic examina- tion showed rods which were very feebly motile; they did not change position, but slowly bent and returned to the straight condition. Most of the bacilli were in clusters. In measurement and shape these were undistinguishable from Leprosy Bacilli. Specimens stained in warm Ziehl's solution for twenty minutes and decol- orised in 25 per cent. nitric acid, were stained pink. No beaded appearance was seen. On May 28th two specimens of this growth were stained for twenty-four hours in Ziehl's solution, decolorised and found to show quantities of brightly stained bacilli, separate and in clusters. On May 29th the bouillon was covered with a coherent pellicle. By June 1st the pellicle had in great part subsided en masse to the bottom of the tube. Cultures in glycerine-bouillon, glycerine-gelatine, and glycerine-agar were made from this original growth and carried on for several generations. The growth in gelatine shows on the second day a minute white speck on the surface, and subse- quently a liquefaction takes place along the needle track. This appearance is represented in Fig. 2, Plate II. Subsequently two strata of growth form, separated by a clear liquid space. The microscopical appearance of these strata is identical as far as staining with the Ziehl method is concerned; both consist of bright red rods, but those from the upper stratum are slightly thicker than those from the lower one. The growth on agar presents an irregular outline at the edge of the needle stroke, and this extends rather rapidly, so that a great part of the surface is covered. Its subsequent spread is, however, exceedingly slow.
?428 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: All these growths in bouillon, gelatine and agar were pure and undoubtedly identical, and the bacilli stained excellently, and resisted decolorisation with 10 per cent., 15 per cent. and 20 per cent. nitric acid. This resistance varied at different periods of growth, being greatest in the early stages. Subsequent generations, though retain- ing the shape of the original, did not resist the action of the acid so well, but still stained to some extent. The individual bacilli were shorter and slightly thicker than those obtained in alcohol hardened leprous tubercles. They also had a distinct tendency to aggregate into clusters and lines. This series of experiments was repeated and the details were as follows:- 2. Expressed tubercle juice of Bishan Singh, and fluid from blister over sound skin of the same leper, was collected in a sealed capillary tube on April 14th; examined on May 6th and 7th, stained bacilli were found in strings and in groups. No admixture of other bacilli found. A bouillon tube was inoculated and a growth commenced. This culture however fouled a week later. 3. Expressed tubercle juice of Bishan Singh, and fluid from a blister over the sound skin of the back of the same leper, was taken on April 14th; examined on May 8th, numbers of stained bacilli, which had the appearance of a culture, were found. No other bacteria present. The tube was resealed and again examined on May 14th; no bacilli were found. A bouillon tube, inoculated on May 14th, was the commencement of a series similar t o Series I. Cultivation experiments with Excised Tubercle in Bouillon. Rahim Khan, a Muhammadan, formerly resident in Thibet, has very marked tubercular leprosy. The disease commenced two and a half years ago, and the patient is at present in the full height of the disease; the lobes of both ears are enormously pendulous and thickened. The whole aspect of the man indicates that he is ex- tensively diseased. The uvula is destroyed and there is extensive ulceration of the fauces and the raucous voice indicative of laryngeal trouble. His saliva and sputum abound in nests of Leprosy Bacilli. It was determined in this case (and the results of the treatment were a great improvement in the health of the patient) to excise the tuberculated masses in the ears. Accordingly, on May 22nd. 1891, the whole lobe of the left ear was excised with all antiseptic pre- caution. The mass was placed in a sterile plate, and with sterilised knives, one cut being made with only one knife, pieces from the centre were placed in bouillon, gelatine and on glycerine-agar. Nine tubes were prepared in this way, seven being bouillon. The pieces of tissue abounded in bacilli. From none of these experi- ments were Leprosy Bacilli obtained. The growth on agar about a
?Appendix I.                                  429 week later showed streptococcus chains, and the gelatine presented the same growth; the other tubes, with one exception, became turbid and foul, but in this isolated instance a bacillus shown in Fig. 7, Plate III, was obtained, and successive pure cultivations raised upon gelatine agar and bouillon. The bacillus, which was certainly obtained from the tissues, and was never seen in numerous accidental foulings, we believe is probably the third variety figured by Neisser. It stains exactly like the bacillus of the tissues with Ziehl's solution, and resists powerful decolorisation with acids. Gram's method makes its structure very evident, and it stains also by the method employed by Giacomi for the Syphilis Bacillus (?) of Lustgarten. Aqueous methyl-blue and most of the common ani- line dyes stain this vacuolated bacillus perfectly. This vacuolated bacillus is absolutely immotile even in the early stage. At this period a rod-shaped organism, in length and breadth exceeding the typical Bacillus Lepr, but smaller than Bacillus Subtilis, is seen aggregated into clusters and now shows no trace of vacuolation. This subsequently occurs when the culture is about one week old, and one to four clear unstained spaces are to be seen in the rod, which is slightly increased in length. Bacilli, shorter than Bacillus Lepr, with only one ovoid space, are also to be seen, and occasionally a club-shaped form with a terminal space. At all periods of growth this bacillus stains admirably by the methods employed as diagnostic of the Bacillus Lepr of the tissues. We do not believe these clear spaces are spores. In no instance were isolated spores seen. The study of the bacillus in hollow ground glass slides did not throw any light on this question. The growth of this vacuolated bacillus in bouillon is very like that formerly described for the bacillus obtained by the blister method. In gelatine the appearance is, however, so characteristic that it was easily possible to at once detect the culture. A speck growing to a white disc appears after twenty-four hours, the needle track at the same time commencing to form a stocking-like lique- faction in the gelatine. At the end of sixty hours a tenacious pellicle forms on the surface of the gelatine, and a flocculent deposit settles down to the lower part of the liquefied stocking-like tract. Sub- sequently the pellicle becomes still denser, and by the end of ten days the growth has almost ceased, all the gelatine is fluid, and a flocculent loose deposit occurs at the bottom of the tube. The growth on glycerine-agar is much slower, and there is nothing very typical about this. On June 20th the lobe of the right car of the same leper was
?430 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: excised, and with all precautions, pieces of tuberculated tissue were placed in six tubes of bouillon and two of gelatine. The cultures were kept at the room temperature, which averaged 25C. On the eleventh day in two of the bouillon tubes distinct turbidity was noticed, and both tubes showed bacilli closely resembling the Leprosy Bacilli of the tissues in shape and staining reactions. No other bacilli were present. The vacuolated form was not met with. A pellicle formed on the surface three days later and the culture was still found to be pure. Generations from these original growths were carried on in bouillon and gelatine and agar, and these re- mained quite pure for some weeks, when great fouling occurred in many tubes. This bacillus, as far as we could judge, exactly resembled the one obtained in our earliest experiments. It stained excellently with Ziehl's solution and resisted decolorisation with 26 per cent. nitric acid. As is figured in Fig. 2, Plate III, a hull becomes very apparent around the bacilli, and this is capable of being well shown with watery methyl-violet and to a less extent by the method employed for showing the capsule of Friedlnder's Pneumococcus.50 The aggregation of these bacilli into groups is most peculiar, and the appearance figured in Plate III, Fig. 4, recalls very much the arrange- ment within the tissues, masses of bacilli being collected together into clusters, due possibly to the nature of the hull of the bacillus. Cultivation Experiments with Juice from Leprous Tubercle. On July 8th an unbroken tubercle on the elbow of the same leper was scraped with a knife, washed with carbolic soap and perchloride solution, and after puncture with every precaution, leper juice was collected in a sterile capillary tube and dropped into glycerine- bouillon. Six tubes were prepared in this way, of which four rapidly became fouled with growth of Bacillus Subtilis and staphylococci; the other two remained pure and were kept in the incubator at 37C. In both these tubes free bacilli, undistinguishable from Leprosy Bacilli, were found about the tenth day. We did not have the opportunity of continuing this culture on agar. As will be seen from the next section, all attempts to establish the pathogenic character of the three bacilli described above were without success, and consequently it is impossible to affirm with certainty that the cultivation of the Bacillus Lepr has been accom- plished by us. We do, however, claim to have obtained the same (50) Friedlnder, op. cit.
?Appendix I.                                      431 bacillus from the tissues of lepers by three different methods. Allowing that the form of this cultivated bacillus is slightly broader than that met with in the tissues, this alone would not constitute a serious distinction, for, as is well known, bacilli, which are specific pathogenic parasites, vary greatly in size, according to the nature of the medium51 on which they grow, and further the same specific bacillus varies in size according to the animal in which it occurs.52 Lastly, the aspect of the cultivated Bacillus Lepr is unknown to us. Also, as far as staining reaction and measurements can serve as criteria, the bacillus we have figured does correspond with that of the tissues. In the course of numerous foulings of cultures neither this form nor that of the vacuolated bacillus were ever found as a contamination, and we are convinced that both these forms were obtained from tubercular masses. No skin was adherent to the pieces used as a source of culture. It is on the staining properties that we rely, and we believe that we have cultivated two bacilli of different morphological form which respond to the staining methods used as diagnostic of the Bacillus Lepr. However, the rapidity of the growth of the subcultures greatly exceeds that of the original. This has surprised us, for we should have expected that the rate of multiplication of the specific bacillus of a disease such as leprosy, which is so essentially chronic, would have been slower. Quite recently Campana53 found in cultivations of tissue from tuberculous leprosy a bacillus which morphologically entirely resem- bled Bacillus Lepr. Treated by Ehrlich's method this did not take on a double staining. In two cases this bacillus grew in agar-agar and in meat peptone to which 3 per cent. of grape sugar was added. The bacillus did not grow in fluid media. Inoculation experiments on rats were negative. Campana does not infer that this bacillus is identical with Bacillus Lepr, since he only found a resemblance between the two. It is perhaps possible, though we do not incline to this view. that the bacillus described by Campana may resemble that of our cultures. We refrain from definitely asserting that our culture is the Lep- rosy Bacillus, since it apparently possesses no pathogenic power. Possibly leprosy, like syphilis and cancer,64 is an essentially human (51) See Buchner's figures of Bac. Anthracis in Zopf's Die Spaltpilze . (52) K. Huber, Deutsche Med. Wochen. 1881, No. 8. Bac. Anthracis is largest in mice, smallest in the cow, and of a mean between these in rabbits and guinea-pigs. (53) Campana (Reforma Med. No. 14, 1891), quoted from British Medical Journal of June 20th, 1891.

Keanu, a Hawaiian man in Oahu Gaol, in consideration of the commutation of his sentence of capital punishment, voluntarily sub- mitted to inoculation of a leprous tubercle under the skin of the left fore-arm. This was performed by Dr. Arning on September 30th, 1884,55 and at this time no symptom of leprosy was present, and no family history of the disease could be obtained. In four weeks' time the patient suffered from rheumatic pains in the left shoulder, and subsequently also in the elbow and wrist joints Accompanying these symptoms there was a painful swelling of the ulnar and median nerves; fever was absent. By the end of six months the neuritis had gradually decreased, and a small leprous tubercle had formed on the keloid growth at the site of inoculation. Leprosy Bacilli could be detected in the tissues of this scar sixteen months after inoculation. Definite symptoms of leprosy existed in September 1887, and in an- other year the patient was at the full height of the disease. In estimating the value of this experiment it must be remembered that Keanu's son, nephew, and maternal first cousin were lepers either before or after the experiment.56 But apart from this, which we are not inclined to use as a strong argument, Arning's experi- ment, in order to be scientifically free from objection, needs to be performed with reference to the question of race and habitat. Haw- aiians become lepers with great frequency, and the disease may be regarded as endemic at the present time in the Sandwich Islands. The possession of a criterion of the living Bacillus Lepr is also of the first importance in experiments of this nature. Attempts to transmit the disease to man were made more than thirty years ago by a Norwegian physician, who endeavoured to in- oculate himself and other individuals with leprosy by the introduction under the skin, of leprous tubercles, blood, and pus from lepers. These efforts to transmit the disease uniformly failed. Profeta57 has similarly failed to inoculate himself or others with leprosy, and Cagnina58 met with the same result.

?Appendix I.                                     433 sicians and surgeons during the performance of autopsies, or opera- tions on lepers, have accidentally wounded themselves, and there is no case recorded of the subsequent appearance of leprosy. Experimental inoculations upon animals have never succeeded in establishing leprosy as it is clinically seen in man. A visceral lep- rosy, if such a term may be employed, has however been obtained by some experimenters, though a far greater number of observers have failed. In Neisser's observations,59 a freshly extirpated leprous tubercle was introduced into the peritoneal cavity, subcutaneous tissue, and anterior chamber of the eye of rabbits and dogs. The value of these experiments, in some of which there was perhaps a local lepra, as well as some subsequent negative observations in which "cultures" and leprous tubercles were used, is thus summarized after a criticism of the work of others in this direction. " Leprosy in animals has not yet been established by certain convincing experiments." 60 Kbner 61 and Hansen 62 (both of whom inoculated monkeys) obtained negative results. Damsch,63 after implantation of leprous tubercle in the anterior chamber of the eye of rabbits, described an infiltration of the iris, ciliary body, and Descemet's membrane, with cells containing Leprosy Bacilli. In consequence of the enormous number of bacilli, he believed that a definite multiplication of these had occurred within the body. But it is the case that pieces of tuber- cle left in ordinary water for some weeks similarly shows the water to be full of Leprosy Bacilli, which no doubt are washed out of the mass, and it is quite conceivable that the results obtained by Damsch may be a simple mechanical process, especially since a distribution of the bacillus within the body did not occur. The implantation experiments beneath the skin and into the peritoneal cavity of cats do not appear to have led to more than the results obtained by Neisser, that is, a possible local lepra. Campana's64 experiments consisted in numerous inoculations of leprous tubercle on the vascular comb and beard of fowls. A local tumour frequently formed at the seat of inoculation, and large cells produced in the inflammatory process took up the Leprosy Bacilli in the same manner as inorganic particulate foreign bodies would be ingested by white blood corpuscles.

434 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: believes that the results obtained by Damsch are capable of the same interpretation. Vossius,65 by inoculation in the anterior chamber of the eyes of rabbits, found an extensive accumulation of Leprosy Bacilli in the cornea, iris and ciliary body, but a distribution of these bacilli throughout the body, and the establishment of visceral or cutaneous lesions, is necessary before these can be considered other than implantation experiments. Hillairet and Gaucher 66 inoculated a pig with leprous tubercle ; E. Vidal repeated' the experiment, and the implanted mass a year later showed numbers of Leprosy Bacilli, though none were to be found in the surrounding tissue ; these observations may therefore be regarded as negative. Thin, Kaurin,67 Arning, Rake,68 Bordoni-Uffreduzzi (who failed to inoculate with his cultivated Bacillus Lepr) have hitherto met with failure to establish leprosy in animals. Hitherto the transmissibility of the disease to animals has suc- ceeded only in the experiments of Melchor and Ortmann.69 In rabbits they describe an intestinal and a lymphatic gland lepra as developed four months after the introduction of freshly extirpated leprous tuber- cle into the anterior chamber of the rabbit's eye. After inoculation a subacute general infective disease is established, and the autopsy showed almost all the viscera (ccum, lymphatic glands, spleen, lungs) to be infiltrated with nodules varying in size from a pin's head to a pea. In these nodules were quantities of typical Leprosy Bacilli. Numbers of observers,70 who have seen the specimens obtained from these disseminated nodules, are satisfied that a genuine visceral leprosy was established by the experiments of these observers, and the conclusion that under certain circumstances leprosy is an infective disease transmitted by the agency of the Bacillus Lepr, may fairly be made from these experiments. At the same time it must be stated that, although a few animals became acutely infected, a far greater number escaped infection. With the exception of the last-mentioned experiments, it may be considered that the proof of the inoculability of leprosy has not yet (65) Bericht der XVI Vers. der Opthal. Gesell.

?Appendix I.                                      435 been given. Had Melchor and Ortmann worked with a pure culture of Bacillus Lepr and again recultivated the bacillus found in the organs, the proof would have been complete, and Koch's postulates for the specific pathogenic nature of a bacillus would have been satis- fied. As mentioned above, Bordoni-Uffreduzzi failed to inoculate with his cultivated Bacillus Lepr. Our experiments were commenced at Almora on April 3rd, 1891. Pieces of freshly extirpated tubercle from the wrist were removed with all antiseptic precautions, and a piece of the jejunum of a dog about 4 inches in length, was resected, washed out with sterilized warm water, then closed at one end, the piece of tubercle introduced, and the other end closed. The mesentery was left attached. The gut was now joined by double rows of Lembert's suture and the abdomen closed. Two dogs were operated on in this way; the first died on the sixth day. Considerable peritonitis was found. The sutures were in place, and there was no obstruction of the bowel at this point. The resected loop contained a yellowish fcal liquid. In this liquid the piece of tubercle lay unchanged. All the viscera ap- peared healthy. The fluid in the resected bowel and the mucous membrane were examined microscopically. Plenty of Leprosy Bacilli were found in half the specimens of the former; the latter were nega- tive. The second dog died on the sixth day. Resected ends of the bowel had almost separated. In the resected loop, which was gan- grenous, the piece of tubercle lay unchanged. Cover-glass specimens of the tubercle, the contents of the loop, and the submucous layer of the bowel wall were taken. In the first, were quantities of Bacillus Lepr, in the second, three specimens contained Bacillus Lepr, and one showed none, in the third, no bacilli were found. These two experiments were performed chiefly with a view to estimate the pos- sibility of success in the operation. The piece of tubercle would have remained in the loop, and had distribution of the bacilli occurred, these would in all probability have been found either in the lymphatic glands or in the fluid of the thoracic duct. The admixture with digested food and mixed intestinal secretions, such as the bile, which might affect the activity of Bacillus Lepr, would also have been obviated. The bacilli found in the contents of the resected loop were probably only mechanically washed out of the introduced tubercle. Further experiments were carried on in the laboratory built by the Indian Government for the Commission at Simla. Cultures obtained from blister fluid and leprous tubercle were mixed with about twenty times their volume of .65 per cent. saline solution, and the mixture so obtained was used for all the inoculations at Simla. 2 F 2
?436 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: On June 5th, 1891, a minute quantity, about one-fourth of a minim, of a culture of the first generation on agar of the bacillus which was vacuolated (see Cultivation Experiments) was introduced with anti- septic precautions into a pocket in the left ear of a pariah dog, and at the same time about 1 minim of the original culture of the bacillus (which morphologically appears like Bacillus Lepr) in bouillon, into a pocket of the right ear. Both these cultures at the time of inoculation were examined and found to be pure. On June 9th a small subcutaneous lump was felt on the left ear, but none on the right. On June 15th both ears at the points of in- oculation presented distinct local thickening, and about 1 minim of the second generation of the vacuolated bacillus on agar was mixed with twenty times its volume of .65 saline solution, and 1 minim of this subcutaneously injected into the right ear about one inch from the thickened nodule. One minim of the culture (fourth generation on agar) was introduced into the left ear. On July 2nd this dog was injected at the same place in both ears with 1 minim of the original culture from tubercle in bouillon. This was fourteen days old, and the solution injected was 1: 20 saline. This dog died on July 15th, with symptoms of salivation, wasting, and multiple subcu- taneous abscesses on limbs and abdomen. On the left ear, but only at the site of the last inoculation, there was distinct thickening of the cartilage shown by section; on the left ear nothing was evident. The viscera were healthy, but the axillary glands were somewhat enlarged. The lungs, liver, spleen, mucous coat of stomach, testis, kidney, pus from the abscesses, and tissue from the local thickening of the ear were examined microscopically by means of cover-glass preparations. In no instance were any specimens of the bacilli de- scribed by us present. On June 3rd another dog was chloroformed, the peritoneum was opened, and about one minim of the culture on gelatine from the culture on agar of the bacillus resembling Bacillus Lepr was in- troduced. The culture was examined and was found to contain plenty of these morphologically similar bacilli. The dog was killed and examined on August 14th. There were adhesions of the peritoneum in the neighbourhood of the ccum. There were no enlarged glands or growths. The liver, spleen, kid- neys, stomach, intestines, heart, lungs, parotid and submaxillary glands were all normal, and microscopic examination showed no bacilli. On July 8th, and subsequently at intervals of about a week. another dog was injected in the right axilla with about five minims
Appendix I. 437 of a solution of a culture on gelatine from the culture in bouillon of the bacillus obtained from a leprous tubercle by the second method described above, viz., by introducing a piece of leprous tubercle, removed with all possible precautions, into bouillon. This dog was killed and examined on August 15th. All the viscera were normal, but the mediastinal and mesenteric glands were enormously enlarged. Microscopic examination showed no bacilli in the viscera or glands. On June 11th, and subsequently at intervals, a rabbit was inocu- lated beneath the skin of the abdomen with a solution of the fourth generation on agar from the culture obtained by the first method, viz., cultivation in blister fluid. The rabbit was killed and examined on August 11th. The liver contained two white growths which showed psorospermi under the microscope. The other viscera were healthy, and examined microscopically no Leprosy Bacilli were found. On June 11th, and subsequently at intervals, another rabbit was injected on the right side of the abdomen with the same solution as the last. It was believed that the liquid entered the peritoneal cavity. The rabbit was killed and examined on August 12th. Nothing was found at the point of inoculation. The suprarenal capsules were slightly enlarged. All the other viscera were healthy. No Leprosy Bacilli could be found in the suprarenal capsules or in the other viscera. On July 2nd the anterior chamber of the left eye of another rabbit was injected with two minims of a solution of culture obtained by the second method. On July 8th the anterior chamber of the right eye of the same rabbit was inoculated in the same way. The iris was wounded during the inoculation. Both eyes healed perfectly and no growth was visible in the anterior chambers. The rabbit was killed and examined on August 13th. The liver showed a semi- purulent cyst, which was found to contain psorospermi. The other viscera were normal, and there were no enlarged glands. Four spe- cimens of the aqueous humour of the right eye were examined micros- copically. One bacillus comparable with the culture was found. This was probably a portion of the original injection. No growth of ba- cilli was found. The lens and cicatrix on the same side were ex- amined with negative result. On June 13th, and subsequently at intervals, another rabbit was inoculated in both ears and in the left axilla with one minim of a solution of the fourth generation on agar of the culture obtained by the first method. On June 24th a slight thickening was noticed at the site of inoculation, and a drop of blood and fluid taken from this place was stained and examined. It showed four or five deeply stain-
438 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: ed pink bacilli, and in one part of the field a group of faintly stained cacilli, matted together, and strongly suggestive of the culture intro- duced. The rabbit was killed and examined on August 10th. There was some thickening at the points of inoculation on the ears, but no bacilli were to be found in them. The liver contained two semi- purulent cysts showing psorospermi. The other viscera were healthy. There were no enlarged glands. No Leprosy Bacilli were found in any part of the body. On June 24th, a monkey (Macacus rhesus) was injected on the inner side of the right thigh with about four minims of solution of the fourth generation on agar of a culture obtained by the first method. On July 1st it was injected in the left groin with about two minims of a solution of the original culture from a leprous tubercle obtained by the second method. The monkey never showed any local thickening or evidence of infection, and when last seen, on August 24th, was, to all appearance, healthy. From the above series of experiments it will be seen that in the two dogs operated on at Almora, Leprosy Bacilli were found in the resected portions of bowel, but that these were in all probability mechanically washed out of the introduced pieces of tubercle. In the Simla experiments a few bacilli were found in one ear of a rabbit at the point of inoculation, and a single bacillus was found in the anterior chamber of another rabbit, also close to the site of inocula- tion. In view, however, of the very small number of these bacilli, and of the absence of any general diffusion through the bodies of the rabbits, we can only regard the bacilli as portions of the cultures actually introduced. Indeed, these cultures did not appear to be pa- thogenic. There was nothing to point to a multiplication even at the point of inoculation. We therefore consider all our inoculation experiments absolutely without result. Interesting negative evidence was also obtained at Ahmedabad, where we examined twenty-one fowls which had lived for periods of four or five years in the compound of the Leper Asylum, and had been in the habit of pecking the ulcerated feet of the lepers to such an extent as to necessitate their removal. They had been kept apart for our inspection. All these fowls, when we examined them on August 29th, were healthy and in good condition. Surgeon Quicke informed us that a fowl had recently died in the Leper Asylum compound which had a large tumour under one wing. Un- fortunately the specimen was not kept as he had ordered, and the opportunity of examining it was lost. From Dr. Quicke's descrip- tion, however, the tumour appeared to be too large for a leprous
Appendix I. 439 nodule. From the numerous recorded experiments of observers in various parts of the world, and from our own attempts at inoculation, we consider it extremely doubtful whether a true leprosy, such as we recognise clinically, can be produced in animals. In the absence of this step, Koch's postulates remain unfulfilled, and it is impossible to say whether the cultures we obtained from leprous tissues and fluids are growths of Leprosy Bacilli or not. Further experiments which we are determined to prosecute with reference to cultivation and transmissibility to animals, will, we hope, tend to elucidate the aetio- logy of a disease which we believe to be due to a specific bacillus.
440 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: APPENDIX II. Laboratory Work at Simla, BY A. A. KANTHACK. Most of the work described in this short appendix was done conjointly with the late Surgeon-Major A. Barclay. As, however, his untimely and deplorable death occurred before these lines were even begun, the sole responsibility of all state- ments contained therein must rest with me. The results of this portion of the practical work will be stated as briefly as possible, as they convey nothing new, and are mostly nega- tive, or old established facts.
?Appendix II. 441 I.-EXAMINATION OF TISSUES AND DISCHARGES. The method of staining for Leprosy Bacilli in each instance was that generally known by the name of Koch-Ehrlich, or Ziehl's modi- fication thereof. (a)  Tubercles from the ear of a tubercular leper, an inmate of the Tarn Taran Asylum. Typical masses of bacilli were found in the corium of the skin, the epithelium in all specimens being free. The bacilli were arranged in irregular clusters, but at times in small chains of two or three rods. Most of them are pointed, a few however having blunted ends. The other physical characters are so well known as not to deserve special mention. It may, however, be noticed that in some specimens isolated fuchsin bodies, similar to those found in Rhinoscleroma and the fungoid disease (Mycetoma) were found. (b) Discharge from sores of ansthetic lepers, inmates of the Subathu Asylum. Five patients of a purely ansthetic type were chosen and ten cover-glasses prepared from each. Of fifty cover- glasses ten only showed positive results, and these were all taken from one patient. Here Leprosy Bacilli, in masses or scattered about separately, could be found in almost every field. (c)   Discharge from sores of mixed lepers belonging to the same Asylum. Two patients were selected and again ten cover-glasses pre- pared from either. The result was positive in one in- stance. d) Nerve from a purely ansthetic case. Surgeon-Major E. Lawrie, while performing the operation of nerve-stretching, removed small pieces ofthe greatly en- larged ulnar nerve. Cover-glass preparations gave no results. Sections of the nerve, hardened in alcohol and stained in the usual man- ner, revealed a few bacilli between the fibrill, and also numerous giant cells similar to those observed in a tuber- culosis, but smaller. Some of the giant cells contained from one to three Leprosy Bacilli.
?442 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION (e) Nerve from a purely ansthetic case. This specimen was also obtained through the kindness of Surgeon Major E. Lawrie. The result of the microscopic examination was negative, although the piece was excised from a highly diseased part of the nerve. Round cells resembling leucocytes were found in large numbers; giant cells were absent. The nerve in each case, as exposed by Dr. Lawrie, was much thickened, transparent and greyish-yellow, and hard to the touch. The microscope revealed besides the above- mentioned cells an atrophy of most of the primitive fibrill and also a well marked fatty metamorphosis of the round cells, especially visible in unstained specimens. (f) A discoloured ansthetic patch. Surgeon-Major Lewtas kindly removed a small piece of skin from an anaesthetic discoloured patch of a leper. No bacilli were found in any of the forty-three sections prepared. (g) Itch pustules of- (1)  two ansthetic cases and (2)   two mixed cases from the Madras Asylum. The pustules were situated on apparently healthy portions of the skin. Six cover-glasses were prepared from each case, but the result was negative, no leprosy bacilli being found. (h) Bulla on the dorsum of the hand of an ansthetic case (Tan- jore). Ten cover-glasses were prepared and stained, but all with negative result. The patient was afflicted with pure ansthetic leprosy, and had parsthesia of both hands. The ulnar nerves were both thickened. The bulla was spontaneous in origin, and not due to any injury or burn. The patient spoke with confidence on this point, and considering that there was only a slight loss of sensation, there is no reason to doubt him, and the bulla must be regarded as a sequela of the nervous lesion. II.-EXAMINATION OF BLOOD AND SERUM. (a) Blood and lymph obtained by pricking a tubercle. Two patients from the Subathu Asylum were employed, and after pricking the tubercle pressure was applied, so that with the blood the juice of the tissues was squeezed out.
?Appendix II. 443 Twelve cover glasses were prepared, and all the specimens showed the characteristic bacilli, mostly in cells and masses. It was impossible to obtain pure blood from a vessel. (b) Blood obtained by pricking an apparently healthy but ans- thetic part of a mixed case. Two patients from the same Asylum were again chosen, and after pricking the skin pressure was applied to the part. Twenty cover-glasses were prepared, and in two Leprosy Bacilli enclosed in cells were obtained. As, however, these men presented extensive cutaneous lesions, it is difficult to say whether the bacilli had not been shed from other parts of the body, and thus reached the cover-glass as impurities, so to speak, especially when it is remembered that only two out of twenty specimens showed bacilli. (c)   Blood obtained by pricking the dorsum of the foot of purely ansthetic cases. Six patients, three from Subathu and three from Hyderabad, were employed, and though sixty specimens were prepared and examined in no case was a positive result obtained (d)  Lymph or juice pressed out of tubercle after previous ligature. Every specimen (four in number) was swarming with Leprosy Bacilli. (e)  Blisters raised over tubercles. Four patients were employed and forty specimens of the ex- uded fluid examined. The clear serum was free from bacilli in all instances. In one case the blister subsequently became sero-purulent, and of six specimens made of this fluid one contained typical bacilli enclosed in cells. The pustule was punctured, and the collapsed pellicle removed, and next day the soft crust examined. Of six specimens four showed numerous clusters of bacilli. It seems, therefore, an un- common occurrence to find bacilli in absolutely clear serous blister fluid. This does not seem surprising, considering that the greater part of this fluid comes from the vessels, and excepting epidermal dbris only contains leucocytes. Blis- tering is, however, different from vaccination, where the ir- ritant is inoculated more deeply into the tissues, and it may be possible that in this manner cells in the corium containing Leprosy Bacilli are set free with the exuded fluid. (f) Blisters raised over apparently healthy parts of skin of tuber- cular lepers. The same patients were employed, and the same number of
?444 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: specimens prepared, however with uniformly negative result. (g) Blisters raised over apparently healthy skin of ansthetic lepers. Three patients were blistered, and thirty cover-glasses stained, but bacilli were not found in a single instance. III.-EXAMINATION OF SECRETIONS. (a) Saliva- The saliva of three tubercular cases with extensive facial lesions was examined at the Subathu Asylum. Thirty specimens were prepared, and Leprosy Bacilli, mostly in clusters and embedded in cells, were found in every specimen. (b) Nasal secretion- Two patients suffering from extensive facial tubercular leprosy were selected. Except that minute tubercles were visible on the al nasi, the nose was quite healthy. Yet all the twenty specimens stained and examined, contained Leprosy Bacilli in fair number. (c) Vaginal secretion of a tubercular leper- Fifty specimens were examined, but no bacilli found. (d) Menstrual discharge of an ansthetic leper. Thirty specimens were examined, but no bacilli found. The chief results will now be given in a tabular form:- TABLE I.  Source of material.

(a) Water from a tank at Bombay, much frequented by lepers. Only ten specimens were prepared and these were all negative.
?446 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: (b) Water from a tank at Tarn Taran, much frequented by lepers.

VI.-IMPLANTATION OF LEPER TISSUE INTO ANIMALS. On January 22nd five animals-one monkey, two cats, and two rabbits-were operated on in Dr. D. D. Cunningham's laboratory at Calcutta. The tissue was removed from the ear of a tubercular leper, and minute pieces removed from the centre of the excised mass, used for implantation. These particles were inserted either into the anterior chamber of the eye, or dropped into the peritoneal cavity. The operation in each instance was performed with sterilized instruments and all antiseptic lotions carefully avoided, sterilized water alone being used. The eye operations were performed on the monkey (one eye), one cat (both eyes), one rabbit (one eye), and the abdominal implantation practised on the other cat and rabbit. Un- fortunately both the rabbits died before they came into my pos- session. The animals were left at the Zoological Gardens of Calcutta, and after the rains had set in sent up to Simla, where they arrived by the beginning of August in rather emaciated condition, due, no doubt, to the fatiguing journey.
?448 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: I propose now to state briefly the result of these implantations, (a) Cat, operated on January 22nd, 1891- A particle from a leprous tubercle of the size of a hemp- seed was deposited into the peritoneal cavity. August 11th, 1891.-Excepting the emaciated appearance of the animal nothing abnormal could be detected. On killing the cat and making an autopsy, the original nodule was easily found in the omentum. It appeared larger, but this was evidently due to a new formation of fibrous tissue around it, and a delicate thread of fibrous tissue was traced from the nodule to the parietal peritoneum. No dissemination whatever had occurred, the peritoneum, intestines, and other viscera being quite free. On microscopic examination bacilli were found in the nodule, not different in shape and arrangement from those in any tissue removed from a tubercular leper. The result is therefore absolutely negative. (b) Cat, operated on January 22nd, 1891- An iridectomy was performed on both eyes and a particle from a leprous tubercle of the size of a hemp-seed in- serted into either anterior chamber. No reaction what- ever occurred, no iritis or conjunctivitis, and the corneal wound healed well. August 11th, 1891.-The animal was somewhat emaciated, but otherwise perfectly healthy, and excepting in the eyes no changes could be detected anywhere. The media of both eyes were clear to naked eye examination and to inspection by focal illumination and the ophthalmoscope. No iritis could be observed in either eye. The nodule was plainly seen in the aqueous humour and was appa- rently undiminished in size. (1) Left eye.-The nodule was visible on the temporal side, being fixed by a small thread of fibrous tissue to the scar in the cornea on the one hand, and to the adjoining part of the iris on the other, so that it could perform only very limited movement. The corneal scar was partly vascu- larised, but otherwise the cornea was perfectly clear. The iris was normal to all appearance and only slightly swollen at the insertion of the fibrous thread which con- nected it with the nodule. The aqueous humour was clear. A dissection confirmed the observations of this examination.
?Appendix II. 449 Microscopic Examination. Many cover-glass preparations were made of the aqueous humour, and all contained Leprosy Bacilli in fair number. Two or three masses, evidently shed from the nodule, were found in each specimen, but loose and independent bacilli could not be detected. It is thus highly improbable that the bacteria had grown or multiplied in the aqueous humour. The eye was carefully washed with sterilized water, and cover-glass preparations made of the iris. Near the site of the implanted nodule, where the thickening in the iris existed, many Leprosy Bacilli were found, but the same, though much more scantily, were observed in all parts of the iris examined. The bacilli occurred mostly in cells, but a number of loose ones were also seen amongst the tissue elements of the iris. Sections of the iris were not made through want of apparatus, but little pieces were squeezed between cover-glasses and then treated in the ordinary manner. In view of the absence of all morbid appearances in the iris and the comparative scarcity of the bacilli in more re- mote parts of the iris, I am inclined to think that the organisms have either been deposited on, or taken up into, the substance of the iris from the aqueous humour into which they had been cast off from the original nodule through maceration. The original nodule presented no differences microscopically from tissue freshly removed from a tubercular leper, and was full of bacilli. The retina and vitreous humour were quite free from leprosy, or other bacilli. (2) Right eye.-The nodule was floating free in the aqueous humour. The cornea was clear and the linear incision made at the time of operation had healed, almost without leaving a scar. The iris and other parts of the eye-ball, both on ophthalmoscopic examination and oblique focal illumination, appeared unaffected. Microscopic examina- tion was made of the original nodule and the aqueous humour only, the result being that the nodule was appa- rently unchanged, but the aqueous humour was quite free from bacilli. What remained of the two eyes has been re- served for examination by serial sections at a future time.* * June 4,892: Such examination revealed an entire absence of bacilli within the tissues of the iris, choroid, etc. 2G
?450   APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION: (3) A careful autopsy and search did not reveal any dissemination or secondary growths in any part of the body. Therefore the result of these two animal experiments must be considered on the whole as highly unsatisfactory, as there is an absence of infection or, so far as can be judged by cover-glass preparations, of even a local proliferation. The want of inflammatory, or other general and defined changes in the iris, the clearness of the aqueous humour and of the cornea are all against a local contagion, to borrow a term from Virchow. The result of the experiment on the next animal was equally un- satisfactory. (c) Monkey, full grown, operated on January 22nd, 1891- An iridectomy was performed on the left eye and a piece of tissue from the same leper who supplied material for the other animals, was inserted into the anterior chamber. As it was impossible to prevent the animal from scratch- ing, or interfering with its eye, some reaction, amount- ing to slight suppuration and hypopyon, took place, and the cornea also became slightly inflamed. August 22nd, 1891.-The monkey was somewhat emaciated but otherwise no morbid changes were visible on the surface. After death a close examination of the eye revealed intense inflammation of the conjunctiva amount- ing to chemosis, inflammatory changes of the cornea, and suppuration in the anterior chamber. The wound in the cornea had not healed and matter from the anterior chamber was bulging out through the same. Subsequent dissection showed that the iris was almost completely destroyed, at least irrecognisable in the mass of thick pus which had taken the place of the aqueous humour. The anterior surface of the lens was white and softened. The rest of the media were perfectly normal to the naked eye. Microscopic Examination. (1) In the conjunctiva no bacilli were found by means of cover- glass specimens, except at the unhealed wound, whither most probably they had been discharged from the anterior chamber. (2) Matter from the anterior chamber contained bacilli, but only
?Appendix II. 451 in small quantity, two out of six cover-glass preparations showing the typical masses. (3) The other media of the eye showed no bacilli. All the other organs of the animal, excepting a few enlarged mesenteric glands, were apparently normal. The glands will be left for future examination, but it is highly impro- bable that they contain any bacilli, as the whole peri- toneum appeared to be healthy. No reference has been made to the experiments of Damsch and others, because in the absence of sections it is quite impossible to speak with any confidence on such matters as local proliferation and dissemination. This portion of the work has been re- served for another time.* VII.-CULTIVATION EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BACILLUS LEPR. The results of these experiments-premature and short- lived-have been published in the British Medical Journal (June 6th and 20th, 1891). As after a careful review of all the facts, benefiting by the kind criticism of Professors C. Frnkel and Baumgarten, I feel convinced that the artificially grown bacillus was not the Leprosy Bacillus; it will suffice simply to mention that attempts were made by me, in conjunction with the late Surgeon-Major A. Barclay, to cultivate the bacillus, but with no result. An explanation of this matter has already appeared in the above-mentioned journal. ADDENDUM. VIII.-EXAMINATION OF MOSQUITOES FOR LEPROSY BACILLI. The following observations were made in conjunction with Surgeon-Major S. J. Thomson. The insects were obtained through the kindness of Surgeon-Major B. O'Brien, Civil Surgeon and Principal of the Medical College, Agra. Three sets of mosquitoes were enclosed in muslin bags which were tied round the legs of three lepers. Of these one suffered from * Cf. preceding footnote.
?452 APPENDIX TO REPORT OF THE LEPROSY COMMISSION ulcerative tubercular leprosy, another from the tubercular form, and the third from anesthetic leprosy. The bags were applied for a couple of hours in the morning, and again in the evening. At the end of four or five days many of the enclosed insects had died. These, with the few surviving ones, were put into separate bottles filled with abso- lute alcohol and sent up to the laboratory of the Commission at Simla for microscopic examination. Ten mosquitoes were selected from each set. Some were gorged, especially those from the two tubercular cases, but most of the in- sects were of a natural size and undistended. They were placed in water to remove the alcohol, and then each set separately ground up in a small mortar with the least possible quantity of .75 per cent. salt solution, and ten cover-glass preparations made, using up the whole material. In this manner thirty specimens were obtained and stained for sixteen hours in anilin-fuchsin and treated in the usual manner. On microscopic examination no Leprosy Bacilli were found in any of the cover-glasses ; a few cocci in some of the specimens were the only organisms seen. Mosquitoes and Leprosy. NATURE OF DISEASE.
