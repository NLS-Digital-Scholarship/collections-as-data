MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. (Received for publication on 10 December 1943) (With Plates I and II and three text-figures) THE object of this article is to place on record and to discuss figures relating to the incidence and mortality from strangles which have been collected over a number of years from Army Remount Depots and Stud Farms in India by the Army Veterinary Department and by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The opportunity will also be taken to set out the pro- cedures that have been commonly adopted at depots and farms in maintaining remount stock. The term 'strangles', as used in this article and as sometimes used in a clinical sense, is a comprehensive one and may be taken to include not only cases with the typical sub-maxillary abscess, associated or not with suppurations in other parts of the body, but also cases of acute nasal catarrh or laryngitis in young horses, especially where there has been contact with typical abscess cases. Certainly in practice, the definition of 'strangles' is an elastic one and will no doubt vary according to the fancy of different veterinary officers, but from our present point of view clinical niceties matter little. What we are now concerned with is a more or less acute affection involving the upper respiratory tract of young horses or mules frequently accompanied by suppuration of the sub-maxillary lymph glands or other glands about the throat, occasionally followed by pyaemic lesions in other regions of the body, occasionally fatal and always to be regarded as infectious. From recent researches, there can no longer be reasonable doubt that this disease complex is caused by hæmolytic strep- tococci, belonging to Lancefield's serological group C, though not necessarily of the same serolo- gical type [Bazeley, 1942]. BREEDING OF HORSES AND MULES FOR ARMY PURPOSES AND THE PROCEDURE ORDINARILY ADOPTED AT ARMY REMOUNT DEPOTS AND STUD FARMS The Director, Army Remount Department, has been good enough to provide the following information. " Between 1927 and 1939 the number of 'branded' mares under control of the Remount Department in India averaged 12;698 a each year. The main breeding operations were carried out in the Civil Districts of Lyallpur, Sheikhupura, Jhang, Shahpur, Montgomery and Multan. 'Unbound ' horse-breeding (now abol- ished) was also undertaken during the same period in Rawalpindi, Attock, Gujarat and Hazara districts. Young stock are purchased by officers of the Department from September to March each year and are sent to the Army Remount Depots at Mona and Sargodha in the north-west Punjab. During this purchasing season the officer tours his area three or four times. The procedure in the case of these 'area-bred' animals is that all young stock are sent by road, a distance up to say ten miles, to collecting centres for ins- pection by the Remount Officer. Animals stay in the collecting centres for periods not exceeding 24 hours, and, if purchased, they are then trucked in lots of eight or ten and sent by rail to the depots, the journey taking anything up to 24 hours. The normal age of purchase is 12-18 months, but in the case of well-developed or backward stock these general limits may be varied at discretion. Also, mules may be bought when only six months old. With horse stock the average purchase age has been fixed at 12-18 months, since experience has shown that animals less than 12 months old develop more severe strangles than older ones." Remount Depots To give a preliminary idea of the magnitude of the strangles problem, it may be said that Mona and Sargodha depots each cover some 10,000 acres of land and that at any one time each of them may have to accommodate up to 2,000 horses and as many mules. The land is flat and canal- irrigated and grows such fodder as lucerne shaftal, berseem, jowar, oats, barley, gram. Th general principles of management at both depots are the same. The young stock on arrival are grouped in 'dry' reception paddocks (i.e. without natural grazing) in a part of the depot set aside as a 'segregation area', in which the strangles hospitals are situated. In this area they remain until the close of the 'strangles season' in May, when they are moved into the depot proper, the reception paddocks then re- maining free of stock until the next purchasing season. In the depot proper the animals remain until they are issued to military units at four years of age (mules) or five years (horses). Feeding throughout is liberal, consisting of green fodder grazing, oat hay, jowar, barley and other con- centrates. 1
2 Problem of Equine Strangles in India Mona Segregation. At this depot the segregation area covers about 200 acres and is separated from the depot proper by a railway track. As the young stock are received, they are grouped in lots of 10-15 and are kept for the first three days in mud-wall enclosures (Plate I, fig. 1), containing a chappar or shelter and situated within the re- ception paddock which itself covers about two acres. The object of this incarceration is that the animals may get thoroughly used to one another and quieten down. After this, they are allowed into the paddock to 'get used to wire'. If, as sometimes happens, paddocks with walled enclosures are not available, the animals are turned into paddocks which have simply a central railed-off chappar, this being a more open ar- rangement. Each unit of 10-15 animals is kept entirely separate from other similar units, e.g., they go separately for grazing. Most of the young stock horses bought are colts, because (a) they are more useful for army work, and (b) the fillies are mostly required for replacement pur- poses in the breeding area. The fact, however, that some fillies are bought causes some difficulty in distribution while in segregation, since they have to be kept separate from the colts. It may finally be noted that, when owing to depletion in numbers by strangles not more than three or four animals are left in a reception paddock, the re- mainder may be mixed to form a fresh unit. As soon as animal develops a typical attack of strangles, it is removed to a hospital set apart for this disease. For the more severe cases, the accommodation is of the 'open-stall' type, the stalls being about ten feet square, with earth floors and iron roofing (Plate I, fig. 2). Mild cases may have to run loose, owing to shortage of stall accommodation (Plate I, fig. 3). On discharge, the animals go to grazing convalescent paddocks, specially allotted for such cases, each paddock being wire-fenced and about two acres in extent, intended for ten animals and containing a 'dry' enclosure for feeding and sheltering at night (Plate I, fig, 4). Animals discharged from hospital do not go back to their original reception paddocks but remain in the convalescent paddocks until May. Any animal that may happen to develop strangles after transfer to the depot proper is likewise treated in the strangles hospital. It may also be noted that simple catarrh or fever cases may be treated not in hospital but under isolation in the convalescent paddocks. It is understood that up to about 1927 the segregation procedure at Mona was essentially the same. The segregation camp was located in a more or less confined area and consisted of 30 paddocks. In 1927 the paddocks were changed from an unsatisfactory 'inter-communicating' type to a 'multiple dispersion' type which aimed at reducing the chances of contact among the young stock. At the same time, there was in- troduced a secondary segregation or 'semi- segregation' for stock which had recovered from strangles two or three months before. For this purpose, areas consisting of both dry and grazing paddocks were used, an excellent arrangement for convalescent animals. Since 1931, the amount of grazing has been increased, and this is now pro- vided for all incoming young stock as soon as possible after their arrival. Post-segregation. The system, which is at present in operation and which is similar in principle to that adopted in earlier years, is in outline as follows: Young stock horses coming- out of segregation are first moved into a certain area of the depot proper where they remain for 12 months, assembled in groups of up to 40 animals. At the beginning of the next year, by which time they are two and a half to three years old, they are moved to another part of the same area into paddocks capable of holding as many as 50 or 60 animals (Plate I, fig. 5). (There are now some 35 paddocks of this type in the primary post- segregation area at Mona). At this time they are castrated, and they remain in this area until they are approximately four years old. The paddocks here are dry ones and are often separated by a single fence of wire. At the centre of each is a square mud-brick enclosure (for food, etc., storage), provided on the outer side with mangers and usually situated near trees for shade. The size of the paddocks is variable, from 6 or 8 to 15 acres, and close by are grazing lands (berseem, lucerne) where the horses are allowed to remain for several hours daily. At night they remain free in the dry paddocks. After the animals have reached four years of age, they are brought into the 'Home Lines' where they are given some training (riding, lungeing) prior to issue. By this system of movement horses purchased in one year are kept separate from those of another year. The above account refers to young stock horses. Mules purchased as above in the breeding areas are treated similarly, but they are kept in larger groups during their period in segregation, partly for administrative reasons and partly because they are more hardy. After their first year they are moved into the depot proper where they re- main till two-and-a-half to three years old; they are then distributed anywhere in the depot proper for work until they are issued. argodha The situation at this depot has been similar on the whole to that at Mona, and it is only necessary to call attention to certain differences.

F. C. MINETT 3 Segregation. In 1924 there were three main segregation blocks, known as A, B and C, each quite separate from the other and in fact one to two miles apart. Each block was enclosed by wire and was divided up by wire fencing into small paddocks. 'A' block, for example, had some 16 dry paddocks, each of about three to four acres, and into one of these as many as 20-40 fresh purchases might be placed. Each block had its own strangles hospital and convalescent paddock where animals were put for one to two months prior to removal to another part of the segregation area. Major W. N. Rowston, R. A. V. C., has stated that in 1924 young stock horses on arrival were first put into block A and, when this was full, blocks B and C were brought into occupation. At a later date, it appears that block C was reserved for mules. It is also stated that, when the numbers of horses in a paddock were depleted by strangles, it was the practice to fill up with young mules. It is recounted that some of the reception paddocks had a feeding chappar, while others had none, feed-troughs made of dried mud being placed around the bases of trees. Actually, there is now little shelter in these paddocks, as many trees have been injured by waterlogging of the soil. At the present time, 'A' block alone remains, while other arrangements have been made for the segregation of mules. Plate [I, figs. 6 and 7 show the type of reception paddock and hospital accommodation at present existing. Stud Farms Information on the subject of this paper has also been received from four Stud Farms, partly maintained for Army Remount purposes, viz. those at Probynabad, Coleyana and Renala in the Punjab and that at Ahmednagar in Bombay. In passing, it should be made clear that the rearing of horses for army purposes is not confined to stud farms, that is farms managed under the Horse-breeding Grantee Scheme. Considerable numbers of horses are also produced in villages of the Punjab under an 'area-breeding' scheme, where people may keep only one or two mares. On the other hand, some of the stud farms are of considerable size. Coleyana and Renala Estates, for instance, having about 7,500 acres of canal- irrigated land and maintaining some 170-200 brood mares and 100-150 young stock (birth to four to five years), in addition to thorough-bred stock which are raised under private enterprise. Under the conditions of the horse-breeding grant, brood mares are approved by the Army Remount Department, are mated with stallions similarly approved, and the offspring offered at fixed prices to the Army from 12-18 months of age. If accepted, they are transferred to Mona or Sargodha, otherwise they are sold privately or in the case of suitable fillies retained for breeding purposes. At Ahmednagar, which was closed in 1940, it was the practice to keep selected stock to four to five years old and then send them direct to units. Table IV shows the distribution of young stock by age groups for two of the farms, Pro- bynabad and Coleyana. At the former stud those in the age groups of one, two and three years are in roughly the same proportion, while at Coleyana the proportion of yearlings is higher than at later ages. The animal husbandry procedures at the diff- erent stud farms no doubt vary in detail according to the will of the owner. According to the general plan, mares foal chiefly in February to June and smaller number in September to November, foals are weaned at six or seven months, drafted into batches of 10-15 and after some time the sexes are separated. Stock are turned into grazing (shaftal, lucerne) or exercise paddocks during the day time and are sometimes brought into small enclosures at night. On the Estates the agricul- tural unit is the 'square' or 'rectangle', which covers 25 acres. At Renala there are 44 such squares, and most of these are subdivided into four six-acre paddocks for rotational grazing, with a centrally situated dry paddock with feed chappar and trees for shelter (Plate II, fig. 8). Each such square accommodates 10-12 animals. At Coleyana, the stud area is divided into pad- docks intended for exercise, grazing or for growing fodder crops. This area is changed over about once in five years, and a similar area which has been under crops is taken over for the stud. At present, the squares are being step by step divided up into paddocks of five acres each for rotational grazing or for purposes of exercise. An open-air system is adopted on this estate, the mares foal in the open, and as a general rule the stock remain out at night, with trees and hedges as the sole protection. The only exception to this is that, after weaning, the animals are kept in half- acre mud-wall enclosures (Plate II, fig. 9) for about a month, so that they may be broken to handling. Stocks are also brought into the yards twice daily for grain feeding and rough grooming. Watering is from troughs connected with small tube-wells. For hot weather, ponds are provided for stock to cool themselves. CASE INCIDENCE OF STRANGLES BY YEARS Remount Depots. Up to 1933, the figures avail- able are for financial years (April to March), and subsequently for 'strangles years' (Sept- ember to August). It would have been difficult to bring the figures on to a common basis, but for a
4 Problem of Equine Strangles in India broad consideration of the incidence or attack rate by years, the labour involved in making the ad- justment would scarcely have been warranted. The data for horses at Mona and Sargodha are recorded in Table I, and for mules at these two depots in Table II. From the frequency distribution shown in Table I, it is seen that at both depots the annual attack rate has only once fallen below 50 per cent. and that in some years practically all have shown clinical symptoms. Among horses at Mona there are indications that 1920, 1925, 1929, 1933 and 1939 were peak years, while at Sargodha the yearly distribution is more uniform. Data are not available to show whether there is any variation in the susceptibility of young stock, since the number of animals at risk at different age groups is unknown. At Mona the mean annual attack rate over 23 years (1917-40) has been 76.2 per cent, while at Sargodha over 13 years (1927-40) it was 72.6 per cent. By applying the x2 test, it can be shown that since 1927 the attack rate in horses at Mona has usually been higher than at Sargodha, and the same is true since 1929 in the case of mules. In young stock mules (Table II) the incidence of strangles is definitely lower at both Mona and Sargosha than among horses, the mean annual attack rates being 53.2 and 46.8 per cent respectively. The yearly distribution is fairly uniform. Stud Farms. The information is shown in Table III. The first point is that the incidence is very variable from year to year. In some years strangles is absent, or nearly so, while in others the rate reaches 50 per cent or even higher. Thus at Probynabad, 1914, 1918, 1924, 1928 and 1933 are peak years, and at Coleyana the same is true of 1930, 1935 and 1937*. There are indications then both from the depots and stud farms that a high strangles morbidity rate has occurred with some regularity every four or five years, and that on the farms in intermediate years the rate may fall very low indeed. The latter feature is in contrast with the more uniformly high rate at the Remount Depots. No attempt has been made to calculate x2 values for the stud farms, since the figures are small and there are few overlapping years in which a comparison can be made. CASE INCIDENCE OF STRANGLES BY MONTHS Full details of the position under this heading are reserved for a paper in which the seasonal incidence of strangles is considered. At some risk of anticipation, however, Fig. 2, based on the data, is introduced to show that at the depots, as the strangles year progresses the attack rate rises to the month of April and then rapidly declines. As between Mona and Sargodha during the period 1933-40, there is little difference in the date of onset of the disease, but from 1934 on cases continued to appear rather later at Mona than at Sargodha. The influx of new purchases continues during the period September to March, after which the population remains stationary (Fig. 1). From Figs. 1 and 2, it would appear that the gradually increasing incidence from September onwards is connected in some way with the increasing number of susceptible stock within the area.

At the stud farms the rates do not appear to differ greatly throughout the year. As to the ages at death, figures for 27 animals are available for Coleyana. Age in months . 3 6 9 12 15 18 Over 18 Number dying . 0 1 4 8 8 3 3 Deaths are, therefore, most frequent in yearlings. The proportion of older animals admitted is perhaps surprisingly high. Of the younger ones, the largest proportion fall in the age groups 10-12 months, the next largest proportions being four to six and seven to nine months. A study of the outbreaks coming within the period shows that the bulk of the earliest clinical attacks appears in younger animals, though it is of course possible that infection may have been acquired in the first instance from adult carriers. DISCUSSION Opinions and experiences of earlier observers on strangles. Many years' experience has taught veterinary officers that strangles cannot be pre- vented from appearing in Army Remount Depots, and many believe that the main object should be to produce a mild form of the disease in early life, which will leave a long and serviceable immunity. Unfortunately, while strangles is always of most importance during the first season the young stock are in the depot, the disease is said to vary greatly in its incidence and severity from one season to another and from one outbreak to another; and this has not only caused difficulties in attempts at natural immunization but has also made it difficult to judge the efficacy of methods of pre- vention. It has been noted, however, that at the depots during any one season the prevalence and severity of the disease increase with the passage of time to reach its highest intensity in March and April, irrespective of the date of onset. Capt. G. W. Short [1939] has also remarked that the first cases in a season are mild and succeeding ones tend to be progressively more severe. It has, therefore, been recommended that young stock should be purchased as early in the season as possible and never later than March. On the question of immunity, mules have a considerable natural resistance, and in them strangles is mild and death rare. In horses, while second attacks are comparatively rare, there are numbers of reports [e.g. Langley, 1938; Short, 1939] of a second attack in the same animal one to eight Mules. The mortality in mules (Table II) is much less than in horses, being about 1.0 per cent. There is no significant difference as between Mona and Sargodha, nor in mortality rates over years. AGES OF ANIMALS AT ADMISSION The following figures for 543 cases at Coleyana over the period 1930-43 show the age groups of the animals on admission for strangles. Age (months) . 3 6 9 12 15 8 21 24 (years) . . 3 4 5 Over 5 Number . . 11 83 86 123 5 50 21 15 . 23 22 18 Over 37 Per cent F. C. MINETT 7 the efficacy of curative measures may be gauged in part by the case mortality. He has pointed out that factors having a bearing on the result of preventive efforts would be the total number of young stock admitted during the season, the accommodation available for them, and the number infected before admission. As regards curative measures, the mortality rate should not be the sole criterion and account should also be be taken of the duration of illness as determining the setback to normal development. Judged by these criteria, he concludes that up to 1932 the measures adopted at Mona and Sargodha have been unsuccessful. On the question of control we may record the following more important recommendations in a report dated 1923 by Major H. Allen: (1) the Veterinary Officer should be in absolute charge of segregation; (2) young stock should be bought and admitted as early in the season as possible and in large batches. Batches of young stock admitted should be separated as far as feasible from previous batches; (3) young stock should not be purchased while showing symptoms; (4) when strangles appears in animals of a particular block, fill up with young stock mules; (5) never overcrowd the paddocks or the segrega- tion area. Not more than 12 to 15 animals should be accommodated in each paddock. Paddocks should also be well isolated from one another; (6) do not attempt to 'classify' stock while in segregation, as this means altering the constitu- tion of groups; (7) catarrh cases may be treated in their pad- docks, but typical strangles cases should be immediately removed to strangles paddocks and severe cases to strangles hospitals; (8) keep young stock in segregation for not less than three or four months; (9) provide for a convalescent paddock in the segregation area; (10) after passing through segregation, stock should be accommodated for a month in 'semi- segregation'; (11) stock should be protected from chills; and (12) cleanliness and disinfection are important. Manure should not accumulate. Soiled fodder and litter should be burnt. Disinfection of buckets, water troughs, twitches, and the hands of attendants. Fig. 1 suggests that the whole of recommenda- tion No. 2 has not been observed, but with the possible further exception of No. 11, all other recommendations, we believe, are being satisfied. We would, however, add, as recommendation No. 13, a satisfactory food and water supply. Epizootiology of strangles. As a problem in epizootiology, that of strangles at the remount depots appears to be a fairly straightforward one and can be dealt with on lines which are familiar to students of the subject. The rise in the incidence of strangles when young horses are brought together somewhat resembles the epide- mic rise of naso-pharyngeal infections which fol- low the reaggregation of children shortly after the commencement of the school terms. It may be a useful lesson to try to visualize for a moment what may really be happening when a batch of 30-60 young horses is brought in and then split up into smaller groups of say 12 to 15 each. At the time of arrival, the animals are certainly not normal in the sense that all are free from the streptococci which cause strangles nor as pos- sessing a uniform susceptibility to these strep- tococci, should they chance to meet them. We may assume that some, perhaps many of them, although apparently in good health, will be harbouring the specific streptococci in some part of the upper respiratory tract (healthy carriers or latent cases), a few may be suffering from atypical strangles in the form of nasal catarrh, and the rest will be really healthy. It may next be noted (a) that the status of many animals of the group, in respect of their bodily resistance and of any pathogenic streptococci they may harbour, has changed since their earlier days in the breeding areas, because they are now older, may already have experienced strangles, have mixed with new companions, and have just undergone the fatigue of a journey to the depot; and (b) that their status is destined to change still more profoundly under the new conditions they will experience at the depot. Thus it may be expected that, as a result of the unusually close contact before and during the journey as well as of the new grouping at the depot, the carrier rate will rise, and in due course clinical cases of strangles will be liable to appear, in which case increasing amounts of infective material will become available to other animals of the group. The closer the contact the more rapidly will spread take place and the larger the dosage of infective material likely to be absorbed. The final result will be that all the animals will quickly become infected and react in various ways, with the possible exception of those which have secured a substantial measure of immunity from attacks of strangles in the breeding areas. Thus, towards the close of the purchasing season a horse population will be established having a level of naturally acquired immunity which is fairly high on the average and which is not likely to be disturbed by the specific stre- ptococci still existent among them or by any further happenings. Unfortunately, in the past
8 Problem of Equine Strangles in India this result has only been attained at the price of much acute sickness and possibly severe setbacks in bodily condition. Fortunately, on the other hand, the population will not have been much depleted by death, since strangles is not a killing disease. The misfortunes that may befall our batch of 60 horses will perhaps be aggravated by the arrival at intervals of similar batches, which, although distributed in other paddocks, are still lodged within the area set apart for segregation. We may now add some comment on the above hypothesis. The suggestion that most of the animals in a group will soon become infected is supported by the history of events at Mona and Sargodha where the annual attack rate has tended to be so high. Incidentally, by analogy with what is known of scarlet fever a seasonal rise in the carrier rate would be expected in the autumn and winter months. It has frequently been said that the increasing prevalence and severity of cases during an epidemic may be due to the increasing infectivity and viru- lence of the parasite during its passage from host to host. There is, indeed, some evidence for the existence of special epidemic strains in some streptococcus infections of man. These are strains which are endowed with a highly-developed power of spreading among susceptible people and of killing them. There is also some evidence of the sudden appearance of hypervirulent strains in the case of normally slow-spreading streptococ- cus epidemics in small animals. In the case of strangles also some increase in infectivity (in- vasiveness), together with some increased power of causing tissue damage, cannot be ruled out but on that point there is no information. How- ever, environmental factors acting upon the host, as well as the simple congregation of in- fected and susceptible animals is well known to be sufficient by itself to enable epidemics to progress, so that it is unnecessary to look for special properties in the parasite. It has been suggested above that the streptococ- cus of strangles in different animals may produce a healthy carrier state, a simple nasal catarrh or typical strangles. Possibly, ideas regarding this are now changing, but we may note in the first place the analogous cases of 'snuffles' in rabbits. 'Snuffles' is the clinical term for a common disease condition of rabbits, caused by a pasteurella and associated with pus in the nasal sinuses, and accompanied by nasal discharge and sneezing. Webster [1924] has shown how healthy rabbits, i.e. rabbits free from pasteurella, vary in their response to the nasal instillations of the same amounts of living cultures of the organism. Such rabbits may show (a) no response, (b) a 'healthy' carrier state, (c) 'snuffles' or (d) pneu- monia or death, the result of the experiment in the individual animal depending on its resistance. Since we are dealing here with a respiratory affection, the analogy to strangles is apt. Still more apt is the case of outbreaks of respiratory streptococcus disease in man where the same infecting agent may produce (a) a healthy carrier state, (b) a feverish catarrh, (c) tonsilitis of varying severity, and (d) scarlet fever. Recent researches on equine affections in Australia by Bazeley and Battle [1940] have provided some direct proof in showing that at least some of the streptococcus strains from simple catarrh are identical by agglutination and other tests with those from strangles. They isolated 457 strains of haemolytic streptococci from 415 cases of disease in horses. All these belonged to serological group C of Lancefield and by aggluti- nation could be split into five main types. Although the authors find that the specific types of equine streptococci do not always appear to be associated with specific diseases, it may be noted that all the strains from fresh strangles abscessesF. C. MINETT 9 nized to be an enormous one and is even regarded by some as insurmountable. It is not likely to be a smaller problem in communities of young horses, unless they are subjected to a good deal of res- traint. Such restraint must be on epidemiological lines, and aimed at promoting as effectively as possible the dispersal of young stock from the moment they are admitted. During recent years the truth of this has been well recognized by the veterinary officers concerned. We do not believe that at the present time there is overcrowding of the depot paddocks, or that it is practicable to disperse stock more than is being done now. To emphasize the point, however, we would refer to the case of experimental epidemics in mice, from which valuable lessons may be drawn. Topley [1922, 1926] has shown that when mice, which had been exposed to the risk of infection with Bact. typhi-murium and among which an epidemic was imminent, are dispersed into groups containing 19 to 25 mice, there is little effect on the mortality, but when they are dispersed into smaller groups of ten animals each, the mortality rate is greatly reduced. Once the epidemic has started, however, dispersal into still smaller groups of five mice each had a much less marked effect. Topley, therefore, suggests that, if at the first sign of an outbreak animals are split into small groups and after a certain interval are brought together into groups of more manageable size, a severe outbreak may be forestalled. The importance of adequate spatial distribution of subjects at risk is also admirably shown by the observations of Glover [1918] on cerebrospinal fever in a military unit. He found that the meningococcus carrier rate provided an index of whether there was overcrowding in the sleeping quarters. A carrier rate reaching a certain figure, 20 per cent, could be taken as a danger signal. In order to reduce the rate and avert the danger of an outbreak of cerebrospinal fever, it was merely necessary to increase the distance between the beds. Always to be borne in mind in the case of strangles, as of other infectious diseases, is the question of whether the movement and distri- bution of young stock can be so changed as to lessen the frequency of contact between them. Admittedly, the question is more easily asked than answered, but as Topley [1942] has said 'Any step that lessens the probability of effective contact, direct or indirect, is a step in the right direction. As we reduce the frequency of effective contact, we reduce the mass of infective material on which the probability of further diffusion in part depends.' The earlier in the purchasing season young stock can be brought into the depots the better, in this way a process of natural immunization arising from intimate association in the paddocks will have a longer time to develop before the cold spell of winter. But since natural immuniza- tion is largely an affair of chance, it i unlikely to be so satisfactory as an efficient specific immuniza- tion, so our hope for the future lies in the latter, assisted by good dispersal and protection from adverse weather conditions. As to the isolation of declared cases of strangles in hospital, this is not likely to do much good so far as the animals which remain behind are concerned, especially if we may assume that these include carriers and that carriers and atypical cases have at least some im- portance as spreaders. At the same time, any systematic attempt at isolating infected animals other than declared cases would be very difficult under conditions at the depots. Finally, it may be observed that one way of by-passing the problem would be to replace young stock horses largely by young stock mules, since these have considerable inborn resistance to strangles. As to the treatment of clinical cases, sulphanila- mide therapy is worthy of more extended trial, especially for cases in the very early stage [Minett and Edwards,* 1945.] SUMMARY 1.

OILSEEDS, CAKES AND SOME FOOD GRAINS By P. E. LANDER, M.A., D.Sc., F.I.C., I. A. S., Agricultural Chemist to Government Punjab, Lyallpur, and LAL CHAND DHARMANI, L.AG., B.Sc., (AGRI.), P.A.S., Assistant to the Agricultural Chemist to Government Punjab, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 28 May 1943) THIS paper records the determination of funda- mental feeding data of oilseeds, oilseed cakes and some other food grains on heifers, conducted at Lyallpur under a scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research for three years, and the authors are indebted to the Council for the means accorded for carrying it out. Six Montogomery heifers, the details concern- ing the ages and weights of which are shown in Table II, were employed as experimental animals throughout. Some difficulty was experienced at the beginning in designing the trials in such a way that the results could be submitted to statis- tical interpretation according to the modern methods. It was obviously impossible to conform strictly to such methods, and ultimately, in con- sultation with the Statistician to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, a plan was drawn up which, it was agreed, was most suitable for the feeding trials consistent with the number of animals. In earlier trials [Lander, 1935 and 1936] when six animals were employed, it was customary to put all the animals on the same ration at one time. In the trials now conducted it was decided that for each separate ration the animals should be divided into two groups, designated A, B, F and C, D, E, and the rations to be investigated were serially numbered from 1 to 24 as shown in Table I. Each group of three animals was accord- ingly employed for each experimental period of 1½ months on one of these rations. This ensured that any particular ration would be fed to different groups of animals at different times of the year, thus eliminating to some degree seasonal variations and those in the animals treatment of the rations. The general outline of the whole plan of work based on this treatment is shown in Table I. The general technique followed in these feeding trials has been recorded [Lander, 1928 and 1929] fully in the bulletins and publications on nutri- tion from the Agricultural Research Institute, Lyallpur, in connection with the work which has been carried on here during the last 20 years. It is not proposed, therefore, to redescribe these in any detail. A careful record was kept of the various amounts of rations fed daily to each of the animals and also of the dung and urine excreted. Before the actual experimental trials with these concentrates were started, the six animals were fed for one month on oat hay alone as a basal ration, oat hay being a maintenance ration. The animals were then given their respective rations of the concentrates, together with oat hay ad lib for a fortnight, following which the actual experimental trial for each feed was con- ducted for one month. Again a preparatory period of 14 days elapsed before the next experi- mental period of one month commenced, and so on throughout the period of three years. During both the preparatory and experimental periods, all the animals were fed oat hay ad lib and were always given daily exercise under strict control. During the course of the trials under report, the body weights of all the animals were taken daily and are recorded in Table II. These merit no particular comment, as the animals maintained and slightly increased their weights and also remained in good condition through the trials. FEEDS EMPLOYED Table III shows the chemical analyses of the feeds employed during the period under report. Oilseed cakes Sarson cake (Brassica campestris var. sarson). This cake is a common feed in the central parts of the Punjab and is much relished by cattle. Two pounds of cake (two pounds of the cake were fed in all cases except linseed and groundnut cake), after being soaked in water for two hours, were fed daily and eaten with relish. The digesti- bility data for this cake fed at two different times of the year on the two different sets of heifers correspond fairly well (Table IV). Toria cake (Brassica napus var. dichotoma). Toria cake is commonly fed in the canal colonies of the Punjab. It has a slightly bitter taste and is somewhat richer in protein than sarson cake, and no trouble whatsoever was experienced with the animals fed on it. It is poorer in digestible fat than sarson cake and consequently shows a lower total content of digestible nutrients. Taramira cake (Eruca sativa). This is a popular feed in the north-west Punjab and is supposed rightly or wrongly, to have a cooling effect. It is, however, distinctly pungent, has a very dis- agreeable odour, and the animals at first showed a disiclination to eat it, but they became accus- tomed to it after some time. In chemical composition it resembles sarson and toria cakes 13
14 Digestibility Trials on Indian Feeding Stuffs, XII and the digestibility figures show that the total carbohydrates and dry matter in taramira are more digestible than those of sarson and toria, while the digestibility figures of the protein are much the same. Linseed cake (Linum usitatissimum). This is not generally favoured by Punjab zemindars, but is extensively used in dairies and to some extent in the north-east districts of the Punjab. Groundnut cake (Arachis hypogaea). Groundnut cake has only recently been introduced as a feeding stuff in the Punjab, but it is not yet extensively used, nor has it gained from stock owners the recognition it appears to merit. It is an excellent cake as regards taste and appearance, and of all the cakes so far tested it is richest in digestible proteins. Oilseeds Generally speaking, animals do not like oil- seeds and perhaps this is why they are very rarely fed to cattle. Taramira (Eruca sativa) seed, which is distinctly pungent and has a very disagreeable odour, was not liked by the animals, and they fell off in condition; hence no reliable digestibility data could be obtained with this oilseed. Linseed (Linum usitatissimum) also was not relished by the animals, and the consumption of the basal ration, oat hay, was much lower in this period than with other concentrates. Probably its mucilaginous character adversely affected the appetite. Although linseed and sarson show identical figures for digestible fat and total disgestible nutrients, yet on account of its mucilaginous character linseed is not comparable with sarson and is rightly not used as a concentrate feed but as a curative of digestive disorders. Soybean (Glycine hispida), which stands in a category by itself, has a very high digestible protein content and a high digestible fat content. It is relished by animals and does not cause any digestive disturbances. Grains, etc. Guara (Cyamopsis psoralioides) is a leguminous kharif crop, and the grain is usually fed instead of gram, as it is cheaper. Wheat mamni consists mostly of wheat screen- ings and small wheat grain usually infested with earcockle. It is very variable in character and composition, but because of its cheapness it finds favour with gawalas in towns. Arhar (Cajanus indicus) is also a legume and compares very favourably with gram, but has not yet gained the recognition it appears to merit. Moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius), rawan (Dolichos lablab) and matri (Pisum sativum) are also legu- minous grains and are used in times of scarcity. All three are cheap sources of protein. Oats (Avena sativa) is a concentrate of recognized importance. Chari (Andropogon sorghum) and bajra (Penni- setum typhoideum) are non-leguminous grains, common in the eastern and western Punjab. DIGESTIBILITY DATA AND FOOD VALUES The complete digestibility data obtained for the digestible constituents of the feed, the albuminoid ratio of the rations and the total digestible nutrients for all feeds are shown in Table IV: The figures are self-explanatory, and there is nothing particular to which attention needs to be drawn. A summary of the data pre- sented is shown. A point brought out in all digestibility trials is that the data obtained for ash, digestible fibre and nitrogen-free extract are likely to be mislead- ing. As Maynard [1937] has pointed out some of the absorbed minerals are excreted through the gut, and there is no method of separating such minerals from the portion which originally failed to be absorbed. This being so, and as the re- excreted portion may be large as well as a variable part of the whole, it is obviously impossible to arrive at a figure of any value for the digestibility of most of the mineral elements. As Maynard records, data for digestible ash, which are frequent- ly reported in connection with digestion trials, have no real significance. These facts have been noticed during many years' experience of digesti- bility trials at Lyallpur, and it has been decided accordingly not to present these figures. Another important point which experience with feeding trials has emphasized is the difficulty of obtaining reliable figures for the digestibility of the fibre in feeds, such as oilseed cakes where the fibre content is as a rule low. The digestibility of the fibre in such cases is invariably masked by the fibre of the basal ration and abnormal figures are generally obtained. It is considered desir- able, therefore, to group 'crude fibre' and 'nitrogen- free extract' together as 'total carbohydrates ', a procedure which has also been followed by Watson and his colleagues [1939]. This procedure gives more satisfactory results and does not affect the figures for the total digestible nutrients or starch equivalents. In the past it has been a common practice with research workers to work out the net energy values from the ascertained starch equivalents in a ration. Modern practice, however, is discarding this, and as Maynard points out, the values for total digestible nutrients must be considered the most practical measure, both for comparing feeds and as a basis for feeding standards. It must be recognized that the values for individual feeds are not constant and that they do not take account
P. E. LANDER AND LAL CHAND DHARMANI 15 of all losses during the passage of the feed through the alimentary canal, but these limitations can be lessened in practice by bearing in mind that digestibility is influenced by many factors and also by taking into account the losses to which digested nutrients are subject during the metabolic cycle. We have accordingly shown the total digestible nutrients in Table IV for all the feeds investigated. In conclusion it may be pointed out that the data now presented represent fundamental data, the value of which can only be properly utilized if applied in the computing of rations on the basis of digestible nutrients which the various rations contain and of economic factors connected with the prices of feeding stuffs at various times of the year.

20 Digestibility Trials on Indian Feeding Stuffs, XII Table IVSIMPLIFICATION OF THE GERBER TEST USED FOR TESTING FAT IN MILK By ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, D. R. KASHYAP AND NOSHIR N. DASTUR. Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 8 June 1943) IN India the Gerber method for testing fat in milk is almost universally used. The method embodies accuracy with simplicity. Its only drawback is that it cannot always be carried out under village conditions, without an expensive outfit. The war conditions have added to the difficulty of obtaining the equipment at present. According to the standard method, centrifuging is essential. Purchase of such a costly machine is usually beyond the means of small producers, especially so at present. The following preli- minary studies were, therefore, carried out with a view to modifying the technique of the Gerber test so that by using the same standard glassware, the costly centrifuge might be dispensed with, without reducing the accuracy of the results. EXPERIMENTAL (i) The effect of keeping test solution for different time intervals on the Gerber test This part of the experiment was planned with the object of determining how long a fieldman could safely keep the mixture of milk, acid and alcohol in a fit condition before taking the reading, and without in any way impairing the accuracy of the test, in case a centrifuge was not readily available. Reaction mixtures containing 10 ml. of sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.82), 11 ml. of milk and 1 ml. of amyl alcohol were prepared and kept at room temperature for different intervals of time as shown in Table I. Readings were taken after each time interval, after placing butyrometers in a water-bath at 160°F., both with and without centrifuging. The results for cow and buffalo milk are shown in Table I. These results show that when the conventional method of making the Gerber test is followed and the tubes dipped in a water bath at 160° F. for five minutes before centrifuging, it is immaterial after what interval between the mixing and dipping of the reaction mixture the test is read. It is also interesting to note that, by merely keeping the butyrometers containing reaction mixture at room temperatures for about eight hours and then dipping them in a water bath at 160° F., correct readings can be obtained. At shorter intervals than eight hours, the results were not consistent. (ii) Effect of adding amyl alcohol at a later stage In the standard method the alcohol is added after the milk and just before the mixture is shaken vigorously. Trials were carried out to see what the effect was of adding amyl alcohol after allowing the mixture of milk and acid to stand over different periods and just before putting the butyrometers in the bath. In this case also the readings were taken after each time interval, after placing in a water bath both with and with- out centrifuging. The results are given in Table II. The results showed that if sufficient time is not allowed between adding of the amyl alcohol and putting the sample in the bath the fatty layer does not separate quick enough to give correct reading and centrifuging is, therefore, necessary. (iii) Effect of temperature on the Gerber test For taking readings in the standard Gerber test the temperature of the reaction mixture recom- mended is 140°-160°F. To test the effect of temperature on the Gerber test, three tempera- tures were tried out, viz. 120°F., 149°F. and 160°F.

The triplicate tubes were examined as follows: the first tube was kept at the particular temperature to be tried for five minutes before testing; the second tube was centrifuged and fat read; while the third tube was centrifuged, immersed in a water bath for five minutes at the temperature under observation and the fat percentage then read. The results are shown in Table III. It will be seen that merely keeping the sample in the water bath at 120°F. gave rather a low reading. If, however, the sample is kept in the bath at this temperature after centrifuging, no change in the reading is noted. The same tendency was noted when employing 149°F. All the fat layer did not separate out by merely immersing the sample in the bath but it was necessary to centrifuge it. When using 160°F. the reading tended to equalize, after about eight hours, with the reading obtained by the standard method. Hence it could be concluded that if the ordinary Gerber test is carried out after allowing the reaction mixture to stand for eight hours at room temperature and then immersing it in the bath at 160°F. for five minutes the reading obtained would be the same as that obtained by centrifuging it immediately after mixing the solutions.

ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, D. R. KASHYAP AND NOSHIR N. DASTUR 23 (iv) Effect of varying the period of heating at different temperatures on the Gerber test In practice probably waiting for eight hours before taking the reading may be a disadvantage. Trials were carried out to see if this interval could be considerably reduced by either increasing the period of heating or by still further raising the temperature. For these trials, mixtures of milk acid and amyl alcohol were prepared as usual and kept at room temperature. Before testing they were immersed in the water-bath at 120°, 149°, 160°, 165°, 175°, 180°, 185°, 190° and 195°F., for different intervals as indicated in Table IV. The results showed that the temperatures of 120°F. and 149°F. were too low to be employed for these experiments. As the temperature was raised to 160°F. and upwards, correct readings were obtained at varying intervals of time. The higher the temperature the shorter was the time after which the reading could be taken.

Hence any of these temperatures could be selected, but temperatures between 175°F. to 190°F. are likely to prove more con- venient on account of saving in time. It should be noted that it is essential to completely dip the butyrometers in water bath in all these cases. CONCLUSIONS (i) It is not necessary to centrifuge a sample immediately it is prepared when estimating fat by the Gerber method, provided the precaution is observed that such a mixture is dipped for five minutes in water-bath at 160°F. before taking the reading. Under these circumstances even after 10 days the correct reading can be obtained. (ii) If the butyrometers are allowed to stand at room temperature, in about eight hours or above, the fat layer gets enough time to separate out from the remainder of the mixture and it is possible to dispense with centrifuging entirely. (iii) It is possible to shorten the time before correct reading can be obtained, and at the same time dispense with the centrifuge, by raising the temperature of the bath and prolonging the time of dipping. Thus, for example, it is found that at 190°F. reading could be obtained after an interval of only one hour. (iv) These modifications in the standard Gerber method makes possible its regular use by small producers.
NERIUM ODORUM (FLEANDER) POISONING IN LIVESTOCK By NARAIN DAS KEHAR and GOVIND RAU, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 26 May 1943) ON receiving a report from the Veterinary Investigation Officer, North-West Frontier Pro- vince, in 1939 that several animals in a herd had been poisoned by plants on which they had grazed in a particular area near Parachinar, feeding trials with the suspected plants were undertaken on hill bulls, sheep and goats. This article presents observations on symptom and post mortem changes after Nerium odorum had been fed to the animals. Nerium odorum (Punjab26 An Egg-cooling Cabinet ACTIVE PRINCIPLE Greenish [1881 and 1883] isolated two bitter principles, namely, neriodorin and neriodorein. These toxic principles are possibly identical with neriim and oleandrin described by Schmidberg [1882 and 1883]. Bose [1901] isolated karabin. Pendse and Dutt [1934] made a systematic chemical examination and showed that the bark contained small quantities of a volatile essential oil, two amorphous glucosides, viz. neriodorein (C23 H34O11) and neriodorin (C32H32O7), a solid crystalline wax, a phlobaphane, a tannin and a dark red colouring matter. The presence in the fresh bark of traces of peroxidase and hydro- lytic enzyme has also been shown. Neumann and Linder [1937] have shown that the aglucone of oleandrin is identical with acetylgitoxigenin, the aglucone of desacetyl-oleandrin with gitoxigenin. They considered that chemically and pharmacolo- gically both the glucosides belong to the group which may be designated as containing glucosides of digitalis group. Fisher and Viderko [1937], however, found no alkaloids in the leaves, though Tschesche [1937] and Farbenind [1938] obtained glucosides from the leaves that have an action on the heart. Tschesche, Bohle and Neumann [1938] isolated the cardiac glucosides from oleander leaves and proposed the structural formula. Clinically, it is used like digitalis, but has produced better therapeutic effects. SUMMARY Observations were made on the toxicity of Nerium odorum Fleanders to bulls, sheep and goats. It was found that all parts of the plant were highly toxic. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to express their gratitude to Mr S. R. Chadha, formerly Veterinary Investigation Officer, North-West Frontier Province, for supply- ing the plant. REFERENCES Bose P. (1901). Proc. Chem. Soc. 17, 92 Farbenind, I. G. (1938). A. G.

Very low humidity leads to rapid shrinkage, whilst very high humidity encourages mould growths. Both of these conditions are greatly accelerated if the temperature is high. Wilhelm [1939] reviewed the work carried out on the influence of temperature, humidity and other factors on egg quality. Kennard and Chamber- lain [1940] and Klein [1940] showed that, even when temperatures were low, lack of humidity resulted in marked loss in grade as judged by candling. Shoemaker [1936] noted that high humidity in egg storage was essential for reducing evaporation and conserving flavour. The ad- vantages of combining low temperatures with relatively high humidity in the storage of eggs have been demonstrated by Jeffrey and Darago [1940]; Benion and Price [1940]; Kennard and Chamberlain [1940]; U. S. Egg and Poul. Mag. [1940] and Snyder [1941]. Fertile eggs also become inedible as a result of embryo development after a few days' storage in a warm atmosphere. Rapid spoilage of eggs occurs in the plains of India owing to the fact that the temperature is often above the critical tempera- ture for embryo development; indeed, in the hot season the temperature often approximates the optimum for incubation. Though the consump- tion of eggs in the towns is relatively much higher than in the villages, production is mainly confined to rural areas. The quality of the eggs found in the town markets, especially during the hot weather, is very poor on account of erratic collection from the producers, slow transport from the producer to the consumer and the exposure of the eggs at all stages to adverse weather conditions. As no attempt is made to produce infertile eggs at any season of the year, losses from embryo deve- lopment during the hot months are excessively high. The obvious remedy for the above losses would be to produce only infertile eggs during the hot weather and to hold them at low temperatures. In order to obtain infertile eggs, it would be necessary either to sell off the males or segregate them from the females. The latter remedy is, however, not very practical as production is much cheaper under free range conditions and it is not easy to keep the sexes separate in the villages where this system normally prevails. Further- more, as the villager firmly believes that hens will stop laying or give very poor production in the absence of the male, it would require much propaganda to overcome the custom of running males with the females throughout the year. As proper cold storage conditions are altogether impractical under present village conditions, it would be necessary to devise cheap and simple methods of storing eggs during the hotter seasons of the year. If such a procedure could be adopted, many eggs, which at present are a total loss, could be saved and consumption would be increas- ed as the eggs would be of a better quality. Various methods of storing eggs for short periods, in the absence of ice or mechanical re- frigeration, have been tried. The Canadian Poult. Review [1940] quotes Cook as follows: 'In isolated cases we have found that the mean soil temperature during the summer months is generally low enough to suggest that a reasonably satis- factory storage could be provided in a suitable cellar with an insulated roof. In other districts the required low temperature might be obtained by evaporative cooling, i.e. the evaporation of water from moss peat, etc., placed around the cooled space. In other places sufficiently cool spring water might be available to cool a small holding room. Few of these methods could be capable of attaining temperatures of 50°F. but it should be possible to maintain 60-70°F. in most cases. The cellar system is useless where ground temperatures are high; evaporative cooling is useless where the relative humidity is high and the use of cold spring water, etc. is limited to the relatively small number of establishments where it is available'. Payne [1934] gives the details of construction of an excellent type of underground cellar and reports that the inside temperature remained at 70°F. whilst the outside temperature was 100°F. This type of cellar is, however, too costly for the small producers and egg retailers normally found in India. Berley Winton [1933] gives details of another type which is only partially built into the earth, but it is unlikely that this system would prove as efficient. Collopy [1930], Dougherty [1931], Canad. Poul. Rev. [1940, 2] and Thompson and Roberts [1940] give details of several types of coolers based on the spontaneous evaporation of water. In northern India during the pre- monsoon months (April to June), the temperature is high and the humidity low, conditions which are favourable for cooling the air temperature by evaporating water. EXPERIMENTAL Fig. 1 and (Plate III, fig. 1) give details of a cooler similar to that described by Collopy [1930]. In order to ensure good aeration, the sides and bottom of the cabinet and the bottom of the trays were made of wire netting. Each of the trays held about 200 eggs. The cabinet gave the best results when exposed to a through draft in a shady place.
28 An Egg-cooling Cabinet [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Detail of construction of the cabinet cooler To start the cooler, the water tray was filled with water, the hessian clothes were thoroughly soaked in water and hung over the cabinet with one end immersed in the water tray. The cabinet was not loaded with eggs until the temperature inside had ceased to fall. The cabinet was only opened when absolutely essential as frequent openings, especially during the heat of the day, increased the inside temperature and lowered the humidity. Experiments were carried out to test the effi- ciency of the cabinet with regard to regulating the temperature and humidity and controlling embryo development, the extent of shrinkage and the deterioration of internal quality. In each test similar groups of fertile and infertile, hour-old and day-old eggs were used. The quality of the hour- old, day-old and other eggs at various stages of storage both in the cabinet and under ordinary room condition were determined, Temperature and humidity records for the cabinet and room were maintained throughout each experiment. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY Fig. 2 gives the results obtained in three ex- periments carried out in the hot dry period of May and June. The daily mean temperatures were obtained by averaging the daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The daily mean relative humidity percentages were obtained by

The maximum daily temperatures recorded in the room ranged from 94° to 102°F. in Test 1, 98° to 106°F. in Test 2 and 100° to 110° F. in Test 3. The average room temperatures for each of the tests were 93.1°, 97.3° and 100 . 3°F., in Tests 1 to 3 respectively. The corresponding temperatures inside the cooler were 76.7°, 80.2° and 78.7°F. respectively. Mean relative humidity percentages in the room in Tests 1 to 3 were 34, 36 and 23; the corresponding figures in the cabinet were 65, 67 and 63 respectively. In all the three experiments the cabinet tempera- tures were much lower than those recorded for the room. In Test 3 the average drop in temperature was greater than in Tests 1 and 2 owing to the higher room temperature and lower humidity, both factors being more favourable for the efficient working of the cooler. A maximum drop in temperature of 36°F. was recorded during a period of strong hot winds when the room temperature was 110°F. and the relative humidity below 5 per cent. Thompson and Roberts [1940] obtained a maximum drop of 24°F. with a temperature of 103°F. and a relative humidity of 9 per cent. In preliminary experiments it was found that the conditions of fairly high temperature and humidity inside the cabinet favoured mould growth in eggs stored for more than ten days. In a number of experiments it was found that whilst all the eggs remained apparently free from mould during the first 10 days of storage, further storage for four to five days resulted in nearly all of them developing mould growths. This defect in storage under cabinet conditions was overcome by trans- ferring the eggs into a perfectly fresh cabinet after one week's storage. The cabinet after use for one week was thoroughly washed and left to stand in the sun for a period of three to four hours and rested until required again for use at the end of a week. With two cabinets, one in use for one week and the other rested after cleaning for one week, no trouble was experienced with mould growths in various tests involving storage for four weeks in the cabinets. EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT A total of 240 fertile eggs were used to test out the efficiency of the egg cabinet in retarding embryo development. The maximum daily room temperatures recorded during the storage period ranged from 103° to 110°F. Hour-old eggs and day- old eggs that had been stored at room temperature were used and stored either in the cooler or in the room. The hour-old eggs would normally only be available with the producer who collects the eggs every hour. The day-old eggs represent the very best quality eggs as received by the retailer or consumer. The details of the tests carried out at different stages are given in Table I.

Hour-old eggs stored at room temperature for three days were classified as edible. They showed prominent embryo development but no blood under the candling lamp. Hour-old eggs stored at room temperature for seven days or more were judged as inedible on account of extensive embryo development. Under the cabinet condition of storage the eggs showed no signs of embryo development under the candling lamp at 10 and 14 days. However, at 10 and 14 days about 50 per cent of the eggs when broken showed very slight embryo develop- ment. The embryo development in eggs stored for 14 days in the cabinet was much less than that of similar eggs stored for three days at room temperature. The day-old eggs stored at room temperature showed a certain amount of embryo development under the candling lamp but no blood was visible. The eggs when stored at room temperature for a further period of three days showed marked embryo and blood development under the candling lamp. These eggs were classified as inedible. At each of the subsequent stages of holding at room tem- perature the quality was somewhat poorer than the corresponding hour-old eggs stored under the same conditions. The day-old eggs stored in the cabinet for three days showed slightly greater em- bryo development than at a day-old but were still edible as no blood had formed. After 7, 10 and 14 days in the cabinet the day-old eggs showed slightly more marked development of the embryo under the candling lamp than at three days but no blood was visible. However, at all these three later stages the broken out eggs had very minute

SHRINKAGE Shrinkage in eggs is brought about by the loss of moisture and is regulated by the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere. In commercial marketing it is impossible to determine the shrink- age direct, but an indirect measurement of shrink- age can be made by studying the size of the air space as seen by means of the candling lamp. The maximum permissible air cell depth for Agmark as laid down in the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act (1937) is three-eighths of an inch [Report on Marketing, 1938]. As judgment of the air cell depth under the candling lamp is somewhat empirical, 240 fertile and 240 infertile eggs were broken and the size of the air cell measured by means of a spherometer Plate III, Fig. 2). The various measurements for the depth of the air cell and the percentage losses of weight from the original weights as measured by actual weighings are recorded in Table II. TABLE II Shrinkage Period of storage Place of storage Hour-old eggs Day-old eggs Depth of air cell mm. Loss of weight per cent Depth of air cell mm.

In all cases the depth of the air cell increased with storage; the figures for the hour-old and day-old eggs held under room condi- tions for 14 days were 12.5 and 13.2 mm. res- pectively. The increase in the depth of the air cell under cabinet conditions was much less and after 14 days of storage the corresponding figures were 7.6 and 7.8 mm. for the hour-old and day-old eggs respectively. The percentage loss of weight followed much the same trend as the air cell depth for at each stage the hour-old and day-old eggs in the cabinet had shrunk less than those under room conditions. At 14 days storage the percentage losses in weight in the hour-and day-old eggs were 9.24 and 9.90 whilst the corresponding figures for the cabinet stored eggs were only 3.39 and 2.92 respectively. Shell thickness determinations were made on all the stored eggs in order to find out if there was any correlation between the thickness of the shell and the percentage loss of weight. Micrometer screw gauge readings of the thickness of the shell were made on each egg at each pole and at a point mid- way between the poles and these figures were averaged to get the shell thickness. A critical examination of the results obtained revealed no close relationship between the shell thickness and percentage loss of weight with shells ranging in thickness from 0.22 to 0.45 mm. Table III gives comparative figures for the percentage losses in weight for a dozen selected pairs of eggs. Both eggs in each pair were treated identically. The figures showed that the per- centage loss in weight is not correlated with the thickness of the shell. This is in agreement with the findings of Romanoff [1937].

32 An Egg-cooling Cabinet INTERIOR QUALITY The question of the interior quality of the yolk and white, apart from embryo development, was also investigated. The quality factors studied were albumen index, percentage thick white and yolk index as described by Macdonald and Krishnan [1942, 1943]. Table IV gives data for hour-old eggs stored in May and Table V gives data for day-old eggs stored in June. As the average temperatures both in the room and cabinet were somewhat higher in June than in May, the two tables cannot be regarded as strictly comparable. Under room conditions the yolk index figures for the fertile hour-old eggs decreased from an initial 0.433 to 0.229 at seven days. During the same period the rate of decline in the infertile eggs also was very similar. From seven days onward the rate of decline in the yolk index figures was greater in the case of the fertile than the infertile eggs. Whilst it was possible to make yolk index determinations on all the samples of infertile eggs stored at room conditions for 10 and 14 days, it was only possible to make two determinations in the case of the fertiles at 10 days and none at 14 days. The yolk index figures for the fertile and infertile eggs were fairly comparable under cooler conditions. Yolk index determinations were made on all 12 samples of fertile eggs held in the cooler for 14 days. The yolk index figures at each stage of storage were higher in the cooler than in the room. In the case of the day-old eggs the yolk index figures were similar for fertile and infertile eggs held for three days under room conditions. However at seven days and at each subsequent period under room conditions all the fertile eggs had burst yolks whereas it was possible to record all the yolk index figures of 7 and 10 days and 8 out of 12 at 14 days of the infertiles held under the same conditions. As in the case of the hour-old eggs the day-old eggs stored under cooler conditions gave better results as judged by yolk index than the eggs stored under room conditions. In the case of fertile eggs it was possible to determine the yolk index of all eggs at seven days in the cooler whereas no readings were possible at this stage on fertiles held under room conditions. The albumen quality factors, viz. albumen index and percentage thick white show that the conditions in the cooler were not so favourable to their preservation as in the case of the yolk index. There was also less difference in the be- haviour of the fertile and infertile eggs both under room and cooler conditions of storage. Readings for the albumen index were often impossible on account of rupture of the thick white layer. Rupture of the yolk in fertile eggs also seriously interfered with the recording of data. The thick albumen layer was ruptured in nearly all the fertile eggs at three days in the day-old lot and at seven days in the hour-old lot, when held at room tem- perature. The fertile eggs in the cooler had the thick albumen intact for about 3 days longer than those in the room. Under the cabinet conditions the albumen index figures were somewhat better than those obtained under room conditions. TABLE IV Interior egg qualityA. J. MACDONALD AND T. S.

SANKARANARAYANAN, G.M.V.C., Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 12 January 1943) (With Plates IV and V) LESIONS somewhat resembling those of tuber- culosis may result from a variety of causes, viz. coccidiosis, strongylosis and cysticercus infesta- tion; bacteria such as Pasteurella pseudotubercu- losis, Corynebacterium ovis, C. murium and C equi, may also cause similar lesions. Before Koch introduced the plate technique of isolating pure cultures of bacteria and elucidated the true cause of tuberculosis, there is no doubt that several of the above conditions were often confused with tuber- culosis. Malassez and Vignal [1883] are considered to be the first to recognize the infection with Pasteu- rella pseudotuberculosis. They described a disease in a guinea-pig which had been experimentally inoculated with material from a subcutaneous nodule in the arm of a child who died of tubercular meningitis. The resulting lesions resembled tuberculosis to the naked eye, but instead of the tubercle bacillus zooglIndian J. Vet. Sci. & Anim.

The right kidney was enlarged. The mediasti- nal, portal and mesenteric glands were enlarged but presented no evidence of caseation. It is important to note that the nodules were evenly distributed throughout the substance of organs affected, whereas Baumann [1927] records that in his case the lesions were confined to the surface of the organs. HISTOPATHOLOGY The most prominent and characteristic lesion was the formation of granulomata in the liver and the lungs. The histological structure and develop- ment of these pseudotubercles were best appre- ciated in the sections of the liver. The youngest nodules, visible only under the microscope, were represented by focal collections, in the interstitial tissue, of mononuclear cells, mainly lymphatic and partly monocytic in type (Plate V, fig. 1). With the growth in size of these cellular collections, necrotic changes set in quite early, resulting in the loss of cell outline and marked by extensive karyorrhexis of the inflammatory cells. Old macroscopic nodules were composed almost entirely of a mass of nuclear debris lying in a practically structureless bed surrounded by a narrow zone composed of morphologically intact polyblasts and, towards the periphery, by a few fibroblasts, with evidence (in the form of com- paratively scanty collagen tissue) of ill-defined encapsulation (Plate V, fig. 2). Towards the centre of the oldest and largest nodules were seen several areas which, in contrast with the surround- ing nuclear detritus, were completely amorphous, took up the eosin stain and in all probability were evidence of caseation. It was also in the largest nodules that fibrous tissue formation was more evident. Giant cells were absent, while neutrophil and eosinophil cells were never present in significant numbers. There was no evidence of club-forma- tion as seen in 'actinophytotic' granulomata. As a rule, the nodules were comparatively avascular, but in a few large ones fair sized healthy looking blood vessels had persisted. It was towards the periphery of the nodules, however, that several apparently newly-formed blood and bile vessels were present. The surrounding paren- chymatous tissue showed ample evidence of com- pression. The adjacent columns of liver cells were much distorted, and the individual liver cells atrophied. The sinusoidal spaces were greatly widened and showed a more or less generalized infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells. There was also some cellular infiltration in Glisson's capsule, but cirrhosis was not a prominent feature. Some bile ducts showed catarrhal changes and were denuded of epithelial lining. There were a few haemorrhages, but no evidence of pig- mentation. The pulmonary lesions presented essentially the same features as those seen in the liver and were primarily of the nature of an interstitial pneumonia. Besides several well-defined granulomatous nodules of various sizes, the lungs showed a general con- gestion of blood vessels, a low grade bronchial catarrh, accompanied by a more or less generalized cellular infiltration in the peribronchial and peri- vascular interstitial tissue and a catarrhal pneumo- nic change, and consolidation of the alveoli surrounding the nodules. The alveolar exudate was highly cellular, and as one would expect in pathological processes of this type, was composed mainly of catarrhal epithelial cells and mononu- clear polyblasts. As in the liver, the ploymor- phonuclear cells were scanty, and fibrin forma- tion was not marked. The predominance of lymphocytes in the contents of the larger blood vessels, along with other available evidence, clearly indicated that these cells were primarily concerned in this pathological process. No gram-positive or acid-fast organisms were found but sections of the liver or lung stained with methylene blue or Leishman's stain revealed numerous clusters of round and ovoid micro- organisms. There was no histological evidence of worm infestation nor were any worms or their developmental stages seen in the sections examined. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Pure cultures of the organism were obtained from the spleen, liver, lungs and some of the enlarged lymphatic glands. The organism was Gram-negative, non-sporing and seen in films as short rods. It was non- motile when grown at 37°C., but actively motile when grown at room temperature (18°C). On agar plates it formed bluish-grey, relatively opaque flat colonies, with entire edge and shining moist surface. In broth there was uniform turbi- dity, with a tendency for the growth to form thin, loose flakes at the surface which fell to the bottom on disturbing the tube. There was a powdery deposit, which increased in 48 hours, our the cost of the turbidity of the supernatant fluid. The organism formed acid but no gas from dextrose, maltose, mannitol and salicin. Lactose and sucrose were not attacked. It did not liquify gelatin, formed no indol, did not reduce nitrates, produced hydrogen sulphide, and rendered litmu

DASTUR and ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Department, Bangalore (Received for publication on 17 May 1943) (With two text-figures) MILK obtained from Indian cows and buffaloes is rich in fat. The usual legal limits prescribed for fat in most of the provinces are very low. This provides a great scope for practising adul- teration by the simple manipulation of fat content and specific gravity. When separated milk is added even the chemical tests may fail. Under these circumstances a consumer is hardly able to judge the quality of his milk supply. It is, therefore, proposed that all the separated milk to be consumed in urban centres should be distinctly coloured, so that even when small quantities of colouring matter are added to milk, its presence can be detected visually. For this the colour chosen must naturally be attractive, and it is thought that a light pink colour will best serve this purpose. Similar devices have been employed in other countries in the past to encourage milk drinking habits among school children. The following study was carried out to find a suitable dye and to examine its stability under trade conditions. Selection of dyes. Observations were made with (i) Edicol erythrosine, (ii) eosine, (iii) congo red, (iv) cochineal extract and (v) beetroot extract. All these colours are soluble in water. The cochineal extract used in the present experi- ments was one made by Messrs J. N. Nichols & Co. Ltd., Manchester. The beetroot extract was obtained by pulping raw beetroots without any addition of water. The extract was filtered and preserved in cold storage. Safranine was also found to impart the desired colour to milk, but it is known to be poisonous and hence no further trials were carried out. Concentration of dyes. The minimum concen- tration of dyes to be used for colouring separated milk is shown in Table I. Such concentrations are sufficient to permit visual detection of mixtures of as little as 5 per cent coloured separated milk with whole milk.

The effects of various conditions on the coloured separated milk, which are likely to be encountered under marketing conditions, were examined. (a) Taste of coloured separated milk. Samples of separated milk were prepared for each dye, using the concentration mentioned above in column A. A control uncoloured sample was also kept for comparison. Judging for taste and flavour was carried out independently by several persons at intervals. The average results are shown in Table II. The use of the first four dyes listed above seems to mask the raw, normal flavour of milk and thus improve its taste. Beetroot extract on the other hand imparts a foreign flavour, pos- sibly due to the large concentration in which it was used. (b) Effect of exposure to sunlight. Samples of coloured separated milk were kept in direct sun- light, together with the control for six hours. It was found that there was no change in the quality of treated samples as compared to the control. All the coloured samples retained their original colour. This was judged by comparing the colour with a similar lot which was kept in the dark. 37

Sam- ples of separated milk coloured with eosine, congo red, beetroot extract and cochineal extract were not found to fade or give any precipitate when stored till they curdled. Edicol erythrosine showed a noticeable tendency to precipitate out, after standing over four hours. (d) Effect of storage under refrigeration. Sam- ples of separated milk coloured with eosine, congo red and cochineal extract preserved their freshness and colour when stored for 24 hours at 45&deg;F. The sample coloured with Edicol erythrosine gave a precipitate, as also the one coloured with beetroot extract. In the latter case the colour of the precipitate was dirty white. (e) Effect of boiling. When first brought to a boil the samples coloured with eosine and Edic&deg; erythrosine showed no change. In the case of congo red, the colour became more intense, whereas that of cochineal extract faded slightly and that of beetroot extract faded markedly. (f) Use of coloured milk for making curd. There was no difference in the appearance and flavour of curd obtained from the control sample and those from the coloured samples. (g) Effect of storing coloured milk in different containers. Coloured and uncoloured samples were stored simultaneously in containers made of differ- ent material and tested for flavour at intervals of two hours over a period of eight hours by different judges independently. The average score is shown in Table III.

When separated milk coloured with various dyes, in the concentrations indicated in column A, Table I, was mixed with cow or buffalo milk, adulteration could be easily detected by sight to the extent of five per cent and more. With lower concentrations of the dye the indication was not so definite. The sensitivity of the test can, however, be greatly increased by examining the sample in artificial light. For this purpose, the device shown in Fig. 1 is used. It consists of a wooden box with two holes. The sides of these holes are covered with rubber washer. Under each of the holes there is an electric bulb (40W). On one hole a control sample of milk contained in a glass vessel is placed, while over the other one is placed a sample that is suspected to contain coloured

When the lights are switched on, the adulterated samples appear distinctly red, while the unadulterated samples show only a white colour. By the help of this simple device the amount of dye actually required for colour- ing separated milk is very small in each case and corresponds to the quantities given under column B in Table I. The sensitivity of the test varies with the inten- sity of artificial light. A 40 W bulb was found suitable. It was found that a light blue coloured (day-light lamp) bulb was preferable to a plain one. On a field scale when an electric supply is not always available, ordinary torch cells with a tiny
40 Famine Rations for Livestock blue bulb may be used. The bulb is dipped direct- ly in the milk or is placed in a test-tube, which is then dipped in the milk container. This is illus- trated in Figs. II (A) and II (B). [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Field outfit for detecting presence of coloured separated milk SUMMARY To prevent the adulteration of milk with separated milk, colouring of the latter to a pink colour is suggested. For this purpose eosine, congo-red, Ediocol erythrosine, cochineal extract and beetroot extract were tried. Coloured milks were studied under various conditions likely to be encountered by the trade. These studies show that eosine and congored are the most suitable dyes. Next to them come erythrosine and cochi- neal extract. Beetroot extract is not suitable, as it imparts an objectionable flavour to the coloured milk. A simple device is described for viewing the samples of milk adulterated with coloured sepa- trated milk under artificial light. By the use of this apparatus the concentration of dyes to be used is greatly reduced, and it is still possible to detect as little as 5 per cent adulteration.

In examining the fodder resources of the country for the cattle population, Wright [1937] has arrived at approximate figures which are given in Table I.

Many of these are actually fed by the people to livestock during famine, a fact borne out by nume- rous trees lopped to stumps (Plate VI, fig. 3). In- deed little except poisonous or thorny plants is allowed to remain in the sun-scorched pasture areas (Plate VI, figs. 4 and 5). No systematic work has, however, been carried out on these little-known fodders. The present work was undertaken to find out systematically and scientifically some sources of readily available ' famine fodders' which, when fed over prolonged periods, would not produce a deleterious effect. In the course of these investigations, the possibilities of feeding munj, kans, groundnut husk, bajra husk, rice hulls and molasses have been considered. Their chemi- cal composition as compared with that of wheat bhusa is shown in Table IV. The present article, the first of the series, deals with the possibility of using munj and molasses as feeds during periods of scarcity. MUNJ AND MOLASSES Munj. (Saccharum Munja Roxb.). Since munj is available in very large quantities, attention was first directed to its possible utilization as a feed. This was done in spite of the fact that Bor [1941] considered it of little or no value as a fodder grass; moreover it is very rough with tough serrated leaves. Munj grows wild over millions of acres and,except that its young shoots are indifferently browsed upon by animals for variety and a fraction of its total produce used for thatching huts, most of it is disposed of by burning when mature. This plant shows marked xerophylous adapta- tions. Although it attains its maximum develop- ment in moist land, it thrives in typically xerophy- lous localities as well [Blatter and KcCann, 1935]. Bor [1941] pointed out that it could grow on the driest of soils, though in such places as the Raj- putana desert its growth was stunted. Molasses. As grain is available only to a frac- tion of the cattle population even in normal times, the possibility of providing an adequate supply in times of total or partial crop failure is out of question. A search for a cheap source of car- bohydrate suggested the possible use of molasses, which is the chief by-product of the cane sugar industry. According to Morrison [1937], Snell and Taggart [1933], cane molasses is palatable and is relished by stock. It contains 55 to 65 lb. of total digestible nutrients per 100 lb. which is about 70 per cent of what is supplied by corn grain. With the rapid development of the sugar indus- try, the annual outturn of molasses by various factories is estimated to be well over 6,00,000 tons. Only a small fraction of this can be utilized and the disposal of the remainder is an embarrassing pro- blem for factory owners. The fermentable nature of molasses on dilution and the nuisance that it causes when thrown into open pits require its immediate disposal. Several samples of mollasses obtained from different factories gave the following average values on analysis: Dry matter Total ash Crude protein CaO P2O5 S 76.10 8.27 1.74 0.97 0.07 0.79 It may be pointed out that in the process of sugar manufacture, the juice is clarified and puri- fied with lime and sulphur dioxide. The residual syrup, after the grains of sugar have been separated by a centrifuge, contains, in addition to about 55 per cent of sugars, fairly large quantities of calcium oxide and sulphur, which require adjustment for long feeding trials. FEEDING EXPERIMENTS Feeding trials, which were made as comparable with field conditions as possible, were conducted on eight adult healthy hill bulls. The munj and molasses ration, which was poor in protein and high in calcium, was supplemented with mustard cake and wheat bran, and tried for (1) their palati- bility, and (2) their effect on the health of the ani- mals. Before feeding the munj was chopped, beaten with sticks to remove the adhering dust and moistened with water a few hours before it was given to the animals. The extent of moistening was so adjusted that it did not prick when pressed between the hands. At this stage it contained about 40 per cent moisture. This moistened material was then placed in the manger, and mixed well with cake and bran which had been soaked previously in water. Molasses mixed in equal proportions with water was sprinkled over this mixture and the whole mass stirred up thoroughly. In addition to the above, salt licks ad lib were supplied and 1 to 2 lb. of green tree leaves were given twice a week to provide carotene, since avitaminosis A is one of the chief deficiencies.

All the animals relished the ration after acquiring a taste for it, and within 20 days of the commence- ment of this feed not only did they regain their lost weight but put on 15 to 20 lb. more than their original weight which had been at a stationary level on a normal scheduled ration. During the next 20 days the animals did not gain in weight at the same rate as in the first three weeks on account of a severe cold wave. To prevent its being eaten at night, the animals were not provided with bedding. However, as soon as the cold wave was over, the animals again started putting on weight till they reached a peak of about 30 lb. more than their original weight, or 65 lb. more than their weight before they started on the experi- mental ration. At this stage the animals looked healthy and their coats were soft. Two more hill bulls, one and two, were added to this group 52 days after the commencement of the experiment. In their case the period on half-feed was dispensed with. Though they did not like the new ration to begin with, they soon acquired a taste for it, ate all they were given and gained in weight. In view of the fact that when famine conditions are improved at the onset of the rains, and the animals are given work, these animals were sent out to work on the Institute farm for two to four hours daily. They showed an initial decrease of 5 to 10 lb. in body weight, but later the body weight remained stationary. After about 100 days of feeding on this dry roughage, the animals showed indications of night blindness. Consequently, 2 lb. per head of shisham or pipal or ber leaves were included in their ration once a week. The eyesight of the animals improv- ed and there was no recurrence of this condition. In order to study the effect of weather on the continuous feeding of such a crude roughage as munj and molasses, especially in view of the fact that there is some prejudice against the prolonged use of the latter in summer [Labh Singh and Ghambhir Singh 1935], this feeding experiment was continued from 1 January to 10 August 1940 covering the winter, summer and monsoon seasons. During the entire course of this period the animals showed no signs of ill-health. Sexual appetite, however, became prominent in May and June. When these animals had been on this ration for about two months, a metabolism experiment was conducted to investigate the digestibility and nutritive value of munj. These observations were carried out on hill bulls one, seven and eight weighing 248, 264 and 264 lb. respectively at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment, lasted 10 days during which period accurately weighed foodstuffs were fed and the residue left after 24 hours was deducted from the total amount offered to find the net quantity consumed. The faeces were collected daily for 10 days and weighed. At the end of this period samples of foodstuffs and faeces were analysed. The results are given in Table VII. TABLE VII Chemical composition (on dry basis) 46 Famine Rations for Livestock Since the digestibility values for molasses, wheat bran and rape cake used for calculating the digestible nutrients of munj are obtained from the observations of Morrison [1937], it is reasonable to consider these values as near approximations. It is, however, obvious from the data, as was also indicated by the chemical analysis, that munj is not a maintenance roughage and adequate provi- sion of protein and carbohydrate is necessary. From this feeding trial, which covered almost all the seasons of the year, it was observed that not only did the animals maintain good health all along but gained an average weight of about 40 lb. (Fig. 1) in spite of being given a certain amount of work. (b) Observations on growing animals When a ration is recommended for general use it is not in practice fed only to adult stock but to stock of all ages. An experiment similar to that conducted upon hill bulls was, therefore, carried out on calves to study the effect of this poor roughage on growing animals. Eight Hariana bull calves of four to six months of age from the Institute dairy were divided into four groups of two each. The first group was fed on the basal ration consisting of munj, molasses, wheat bran and rape cake ; the second on the basal ration plus ½ lb. each of pipal and ber leaves ; the third on the basal ration plus grass roots (as in the famine area where tree leaves are not available, grass roots are fed); and the fourth on a normal dairy ration. The calves were divided into these groups on the basis of age and weight. The starting weight was taken as the average of four days' body weight. The basal ration consisted of: Munj . . . . . . . 7 lb. Molasses . . . . . . 3 NARAIN DAS KEHAR weight gained by the control group. The animals in the first three groups invariably left a residue of 1 to 3 lb. during the course of this observation which suggests that the ration could be slightly decreased. All through this period the animals maintained good health.

It may, however, be pointed out that munj is very tough, and when the animals are first changed over to this ation from the normal ration they refuse it. Thus in practice when munj roughage is to be used, the animals should either be gradually introduced to it or they should be given a reduced allowance for about a week. In the famine areas, however, conditions are obviously different, for cattle will even feed greedily upon the bone-dry munj of roof thatchings. When these animals were offered the munj-molasses mixture they relished it immensely. There appears to be some prejudice against molasses as cattle feed. It is believed by cultiva- tors and cattle breeders that molasses produces too much heat. Labh Singh and Ghambir Singh [1934] in their experiments on feeding molasses observed that in winter months (January to April) molasses could be fed economically up to a maxi- mum of 4 lb. per animal (1,000 to 1,200 lb. body weight) per day without any ill effects, but in summer months (July to September) the animals deteriorated in health and their dung became watery and dark in colour. Some went off their feed, while in others the respiration became very rapid during the hotter part of the day. In the temperate regions, however, Morrison [1937] and most of the other workers found it suit- able for use all through the year. Not only has it been advocated as a rich source of carbohydrate [Henke 1934 ; Snell 1935 ; Skinner and King, 1936- 37 ; Snell and Taggart, 1933 ; and Morrison, 1937], but of other essential food constituents as well. Harris, Mosher and Bunker [1933] found that molasses was second only to liver as a source of available iron. The total iron content of three samples varied from 3.2 to 11.3 mg. per 100 gm. and the availability ranged from 54 to 97 per cent. Cunningham [1934] observed that molasses is a valuable source of minerals, in particular of Ca and Mg. Briggs and Hellen [1940], however, pointed out after a series of digestibility trials that the inclu- sion of large amounts of molasses lowered the digestibility of the nutrients in the ration, espe- cially that of fat and protein. In order to determine whether the cumulative feeding of molasses exercised any ill effects on milk production and breeding efficiency of cows, Henke [1934] fed it to cows for a period of seven consecu- tive years and found that throughout the long- term -test there was no decrease or increase in milk production, though there was a slight increase in fat production as compared with that of the con- trol group. There was no increase in the number
48 Famine Rations for Livestock of abortions or any significant decrease in reproduc- tive efficiency as a result of feeding molasses. In a fifteen weeks' experiment, however, he showed that cows fed on molasses averaged 1 lb. heavier per head than those on the control ration. In the present observations from January till 8 August, it was observed that the dried tough munj which is ordinarily considered refuse, was relished when molasses was added to it. In fact, molasses acted as a condiment. Health of the animals. Labh Singh and Ghambir Singh [1934] pointed out that bullocks receiving molasses in winter apparently enjoyed as good health as other animals, but, if the feeding was continued in summer also [ibid 1935], the animals went off feed and their faeces became dark and watery. Morrison [1937] stated that molasses was apt to produce scour in calves if they were allowed all the molasses they could eat. Galloway [1940], however, in Lousiana trials found that, if calves were fed small quantities in the beginning and the amount was gradually increased, there was no trouble from scouring. In the present experimental observation on the Kumauni hill bulls who were fed the munj-molasses ration for about eight months and on the eight calves similarly fed for three months, it was noticed that all the animals were healthy and the bulls were capable of mild work. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS During famine when home-grown feeds are rare the prices of purchased feeds are exhorbitantly high, while money for buying feeds is not plentiful with the agriculturists who have suffered a total or partial crop failure, it becomes imperative to furnish the most in feeding value for every rupee spent. The cost of the suggested munj-molasses ration will, therefore, be that of cutting and transporting munj plus the cost of transporting molasses, since the value of munj in rural areas and of molasses at the factory head will be negligible. It is estimated that the cost of this experimen- tal ration, suited to the needs of scarcity areas, is 25 to 35 per cent that of the standard ration. SUMMARY In this article, a reference is made to the famine problem in India. It has been pointed out that non-irrigated arid and semi-arid areas are occasionally subject to famine. To help starving livestock to survive extreme drought conditions, efforts have been made to discover new sources of fodder. The observations reported here were made on munj (saccharam munj Roxb) as roughage and on molasses as the chief source of carbohydrate. This plant grows abundantly and thrives in typically xerophylous places. The first experiment was conducted on Kumauni bulls for about eight months. The animals gained in weight and remained in good health. In the second experiment Hariana calves were used. The calves also showed a fairly satisfactory growth as compared with the control group fed on the Insti- tute scheduled ration. No animal showed any untoward symptom during the observation period of 90 days. The cost of feeding both the Kumauni bulls and Hariana calves on the experimental ration was 25 to 35 per cent that of the standard ration. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author is indebted to Dr F. C.

KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 2 July 1943) GODBOLE [1936] and Godbole and Sadgopal [1939] have advocated the desirability of noting the colour of the fringes visible when fat samples are examined, along with the refracto- meter reading. According to these authors, ghee of good quality gives invariably colourless fringes and is at times violet tinged. Hawley [1936] in reviewing some of the methods pro- posed for the detection of adulteration in ghee states that it is doubtful whether the colour of the fringes can be used as a reliable method, especially when it is possible to prepare artificial mixtures of fats having the same refraction. Athavale and Jatkar [1938] extended these studies and recommended that measurement of both refractive index and dispersion on a Pul- frich Refractometer using the green and violet lines of mercury are, provide a much more sensitive test. These authors, however, do not give any data as to the amount of various adultrants detectable by this method, the effect of feed on the fat secreted, etc. One of the main reasons why the problem of detection of adulteration in ghee still remains unsolved is the great variability in the composition of ghee, due both to the large number of breeds both of the buffalo and cow distributed all over India and the great variations in the foods fed in different places. Any method to be fool-proof must stand these tests. Neither the studies of God- bole and Sadgopal nor those of Athavale and Jatkar throw any light on these points. The present study was therefore undertaken to test great details the utility of the Refractometer colour fringes in detecting adulteration of ghee. EXPERIMENTAL The apparatus used in the present studies was the Butyrorefractometer made by Carl Ziess. The source of light was diffused sunlight. All the readings were taken at 40&deg;C. in dupli- cate, observing the usual precautions. In all about 150 samples of ghee, known to be genuine, were examined. They represented samples collected from almost all the im- portant parts of India, thus giving a very re- presentative data. For the sake of convenience, figures of cow, buffalo, mixed and yellow* ghee are given separately in Tables I to IV. Almost all cow, buffalo and *yellow ghee samples were collected in co-operation with the Marketing Agricultural and Veterinary officers of different provinces and states. Hence their purity is guaranteed. Most of the mixed ghee samples were obtained from ghee packers. Their origin, either, as pure cow or buffalo, is not known. So they have been classified as mixed.

NOSHIR N. DASTUR, D. R. KASHYAP AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 51 DISCUSSION Refractive indices. Looking at the figure for cow ghee samples given in Table I it will be seen that the refractive indices show a variation from 41.0 to 45.2. The corresponding ranges for buffalo, mixed and yellow ghee are 39.0 to 45.0, 40.3 to 46.2 and 41.4 to 43.4 respectively. These data therefore indicate that figures for refractive index range very widely from 39.0 to 45.2. The majority of samples, however, fall within a narrow range of 41 to 45. Even this range of variation is quite considerable to make this value of any use in checking adulteration in ghee. Figures for yellow ghee fall within the range for cow and buffalo. Colour fringes for ghee.52 Bacteriological Examination of Milk This conclusively proves that there is no justification for taking the colour fringe of ghee as characteristic of ghee. This test has the same utility and limitations in its applica- tion as the refractive index taken by itself. Refractive indices and colour fringes of ghee from animals fed on oil cakes It is well known that the nature of the fat included in the ration has a great influence on the chemical composition of the milk secreted fat [Hilditch and Thompson, 1936]. The wide variation observed in fat from different species of animals, collected in different seasons and from different parts of the country, can in the main be ascribed to this cause. In the present studies some experiments have been carried out on the effect of feeding varying amounts of same cake to cows and buffaloes. The amount of cake included in the diet varied from 2 lb. to 10 lb. per animal per day. Each feeding trial covered a period of two weeks. A typical series of data are given in Table VII below.

SESHACHARYULU 53 have modified the standard milk agar by decreas- ing the concentration of peptone and lemco from 0.5 and 0.3 per cent to 0.2 and 0.1 per cent respectively. These authors claim that their modified medium is as good as the standard milk agar, and the mean difference in counts obtained by the use of these two media is not significant. Hence they recommend the use of the modified medium as a suitable substitute for standard milk agar for the plate counts of milk. Barkworth and Davis have examined raw (cow) and pasteurized milks with the modified medium. As any medium suggested should have a general applicability to all kinds of milk produced and handled under different conditions, the present investigation was undertaken with a view to testing the suitability of the modified milk agar when compared with the standard milk agar for the plate counts of different types of milk, such as cow, buffalo, mixed (cow and buffalo), pasteurized and village produced milks. Altogether 308 samples of milk were examined for the purpose. EXPERIMENTAL The dilution technique of the Ministry of Agriculture [1934] adopted by Barkworth and Davis was used in the present study. The logarithms of the plate counts obtained in each case by the use of the two media were taken into consideration, and the significance of the mean differences in logarithms between the two was determined by carrying out the t test as done by Barkworth and Davis. The mean differences in logs of the plate counts obtained by the use of the two media, standard errors of the mean differences and the significance of the differences are given in the following Table.

SAPRE, B.Sc., G.B.V.C., Research Scholar, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 5 June 1943) (With Plates VII and VIII) THE name Ornithodorus crossi was proposed by Brumpt [1921] for a species of tick occurring in the Punjab. In 1930 Pavlovsky, working in Russia, produced evidence to show that the name was antedated by O. papillipes Birula. He also forwarded to Nuttall and Warburton in Cambridge for examination a consignment of Russian forms of O. papillipes, and these were found by them to be identical with O. crossi Brumpt. Brumpt himself later agreed that O. crossi Brumpt was synonymous with O. papillipes Birula. The writer, during the course of his studies on the morphology of the Indian form of O. papillipes, found that it lacked certain characters which had been reported by Pavlovsky [1930] in O. papillipes and which had been utilized by him in distinguish- ing the latter from O. cholodkovskyi Pavlovsky (1930) and O. tholozani (Laboulbene and Megnin 1882). The most important of these characteristics is the tuft of denticulated hairs arising from the conical antero-ventral surface of the body in front of the camerostome. In the Indian form the male hypostome has nearly parallel sides, while the female hypostome shows some widening at the base. In the Russian form, the hypostome has parallel sides in both sexes. In the two forms there is also a marked difference in the disposition of the hypostomal teeth and in the size of the anus, vulva and basis capituli. The differences between the two forms are summarized in the table on the next page. It will be seen from the table that the Indian form of O. papillipes differs in several fundamental characters from the Russian form as described by Pavlovsky [1930] and should be considered a separate species and that the name O. crossi should be regarded as valid. Unfortunately Brumpt's description [1936] of O. crossi is inadequate, and the species is therefore redescribed below. Female. When fed, body dark grey slightly tinged with green, or slate colour. Unfed speci- mens, pale yellow. Form, more or less eliiptical, the anterior end being a little drawn out, forming a beak-like protuberance. Engorged specimens measure 5.0 × 4.0 to 9.0 × 5.0 mm. (average 8.0 × 4.5 mm.). The arrangement of the dorsal dises is as in the Russian form. Corresponding depressions occur in unfed ticks. The cuticle shows a reticulate structure with irregular pro- tuberances interspersed, these being largest margi- nally; it appears wrinkled in the unfed specimens, the centre of each mesh of network-pattern appears (Plate VII, fig. 7) to be occupied by a single hair. The arrangement of the furrows on the ventral surface is similar to that in the Russian form of O. papillipes. Eyes are absent. The anal ring measures 0.2 to 0.3 mm., each anal plate bearing nine to ten hairs. The vulva is 0.65 to 0.7 mm. wide. The capitulum lies in the camerostome, with its posterior and lateral margins protruding. The latter terminate where the slightly movable ' cheeks' begin. The denticulated hairs on the conical protrusion of the ventral body surface are absent. There is, however, a tuft of short denti- culated hairs on the roof of the camerostome, visible only when the camerostome is raised. The basis capituli measures 0.5 mm. The hypostome differs in the sexes, being longer than it is broad in the male and spatulate with parallel sides. The crown of small teeth is followed by two rows of big teeth, the border row consisting of three teeth, the median one of two only. In the female it is longer than the base and lanccolate, with a border row of three teeth and the median row of two only. In both the sexes, the hypostome has a slightly bulging end. Two long hairs arise at the sides of the hypostomal base, as in all Argasidae. Plate VII, fig. 6 shows the lateral view of the palp, with its dense growth of fine, smooth hairs. The articles show different relative lengths, parti- cularly article No. 1 which is longer than that in the Russian form. The structure of the cuticle re- sembles that of O. tholozani (Plate VII, fig. 7, and Plate VIII, fig. 2). Tarsus 1 has a wavy dorsal contour, the dorsal spur not being as pointed as in the Russian form (Plate VIII, fig. 8). The Haller's organ is clongate oval. T. 4 has practi- cally no papillao on the ventral border, and the dorsal spur resembles that of the Russian form of O. papillipes. Male : size 4.5 × 2.5 to 5.5 × 3.0 mm. (average 5.0 × 2.8 mm.).

S. N. SAPRE 55 It is assumed that the specimens, on which the foregoing description is based, are identical with the forms examined, and for which the name O. crossi was proposed by Brumpt in 1921. I have had occasion to examine several hundred speci- mens of the species of ticks in question from many localities in the Punjab and not one of these conformed to the description and illustration of O. papillipes Birula, as given by Pavlovsky [1930]. In the circumstances there would appear to be good reasons for the assumption that the form of Ornithodorus, dealt with here and which I consider to be O. crossi Brumpt is conspecific with the type of original O. crossi Brumpt.

A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON CUTANEOUS RINDERPEST By A. D. MACGREGOR, F.R.C.V.S. Principal, Bengal Veterinary College (Received for publication on 13 August 1943) (With Plate IX) THE above is admittedly a coined title, and although only to some extent permissible, it explains more clearly than any other the subject- matter of this article. During a rather desultory study of the history of rinderpest in India from the mass of provincial and other records, a striking similarity appeared to prevail in the local names of this disease. The word ' rinderpest ' for this disease (rinderPLATE IX [Indian J. Vet. Sci. & Anim. Husb, Vol. XIV, Part I [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Dark spots indicate nodules [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIGS. 2 and 3. Cases of Rinderpest showing skin lesions.
A. D. MACGREGOR 57 for other workers in India to attempt a closer observation for clinical evidence of this pheno- menon than has been applied in the past ; for it may be accepted that a condition, of this kind, which has been lying in apparent obscurity for some 50 to 100 years, is not as obvious as the proverbial haystack. It requires at times pains- taking search to discover the primary and even the later nodules, which, when burst, form a sort of matted scab of no particular colour other than that of the surrounding hair. The affected sites and their appearance are probably better studied from the accompanying photographs, (Plate IX) although most of these are of animals showing a much more prolific cutaneous affection than usual. In most outbreaks the number of clearly defined nodules or pustules has ranged between 10 and 100 over the neck, withers, flanks and/or lumbar region. Experimentally, the evidence on this point is meagre and ot very substantial yet, as only one ex- perimental calf showed three initial nodules on the neck some 14 days after inoculation with an emulsion of the scab from a field case of the disease, after developing an ordinary mild attack of alimentary rinderpest with perfectly typical mouth lesions. So that the exact period of development of cutaneous lesions after infection is not yet established ; it probably approximates from seven to ten days. However, certain other facts do stand out in the preliminary work on this series of incidents : (1) the scabs taken from the nodules of field cases are infective and capable, when emulsified, of reproducing rinderpest (experimentally in three instances) and even (in one case) of repeating what appeared to be cutaneous nodules result- ing in scab formation ; (2) these scabs were capable of reproducing true rinderpest even after some three works from the date of their removal from the animals in the field ; (3) The blood from the calves so infected has been found capable of reproducing rinderpest in other calves experimentally (once confirmed by Mukteswar and twice by ourselves in Calcutta) ; and (4) this cutaneous rinderpest eruption, as it may be called, is the undoubted cause of a permanent pitting of the skin (shallow sauce like depressions) which shows up prominently in the treated hide, to the extent of reducing the value by 40 per cent or more. In the finished hide, these depressions measure, when single, the diameter of an ordinary green-pea, but quite frequently one, two or even more become confluent, when the damage to the hide is correspondingly increased. Admittedly, the guilt attach- ing to this cutaneous eruption as the cause of such depreciation in hide values was only proved in one case, in which the animal affected was slaughtered and the hide subjected by stages to tanning processes, after careful mapping of the original sites of the pustules. The depressions in the finished hide corres- ponded exactly with the pustule sites. But there is little reason to doubt that the same results will be obtained on repetition of the experiment, which was so carefully done with cooperation of Mr Das Gupta, M.Sc., of the Bengal Tanning Institute. DISCUSSION It is suggested that at this stage of the work on what appears still to be an insignificant prob- lem, it is not wise to draw conclusions, but it cannot be denied that certain possibilities emerge from the material facts now available. It may be, for instance, quite reasonably held that where cutaneous rinderpest prevails the concepts of old regarding the spread and unaccountable recrudescence of rinderpest in areas previously presumed to be free require some form of reorienta- tion ; that the mystery of the so-called spontaneous rinderpest, so long unsolved as to its source, is now possibly given its conge; and that the economic importance of rinderpest does not end with the incapacity, or even with the death of the affected animal, but permeates the hide industry a most important threat to the country. Finally, it seems necessary to add that, from the obviously prolonged viability of the virus in these cutaneous scabs, their potential danger is difficult to exag- gerate, not only from the very common and customary habit cattle have of scratching one another with their mouths and thereby of ingesting in this way the scabs carrying the living virus, but also from swallowing during grazing scabs which have dried in situ and later fallen on to the pastures. However, the presumptive evidence of this kind is all we have at present to support the contention referred to above that cutaneous rinderpest may be fraught with all-important repercussions, such as of explaining the so-called flare-ups of the disease in apparently free areas, or even of the rather unbelievable possibility of recovered animals being so-called carriers or rather vehicles through their scabs of the disease. Still, even after allowing that all things are possible, it seems reasonable to expect that where cutaneous rinderpest occurs, a higher degree of immunity among such local cattle should prevail; for it
58 Methods for Detecting Adulteration in Ghee must be remembered that to the cultivators even the appearance of cutaneous lesions in cases of rinderpest is the signal of recovery ; the percen- tage of mortality in animals showing cutaneous eruption is very low indeed. SUMMARY In India and some other eastern countries, the name 'pox' is given to rinderpest, indicating a cutaneous eruptive fever, other than a severe inflammatory disease of the alimentary tract. In Bengal a benign type of rinderpest showing cuta- neous lesions has been recognized ; and sometimes 5-10 per cent of affected cattle exhibit from 10 to 1000 nodules, which eventually, with the progress of the disease, turn into scabs. Scabs from affected animals are capable, on inoculation and sub-inoculation, of producing rinderpest both of simple and cutaneous types. The prolonged viability of the virus in the dried scab seems to answer many of the problems relating to the appearance of so-called 'spontaneous.' rinderpest. The cutaneous eruptions cause a great deal of damage to the hide industry and reduce the value of hides to the extent of 40 per cent. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Even a preliminary note of this kind would not be complete without acknowledging the work of collaborators. Mr M. B. Menon, Superintendent, Veterinary Vaccine Section, was concerned with reproducing rinderpest in calves from emulsions of cutaneous, scabs in two instances. The blood of one of these cases was confirmed at Mukteswar to be infective, although scabs from the same lot which produced the disease failed at Mukteswar to produce a reaction. This latter fact can only be explained as due to the loss of viability in transit or the age factor of the scabs. Mr R. N. Mohan, Disease Investigation Officer, Bengal succeeded in his first attempt in reproduc- ing typical rinderpest in at least one of two calves injected with scab emulsion. Blood from this infected calf was again successful in producing rinderpest in one of two calves sub-inoculated. In addition, calf first mentioned developed on the 14th day after injection of scab emulsion three nodules on the skin of the neck which resembled to a great extent those usually to be seen in field cases. In respect of these latter experiments by Mr R. N. Mohan I cannot but praise the meti- culous care and attention with which he conducted the work; he is, therefore, deserving of any credit which may emanate from this preliminary record.

Special Pathology and Therapeutics of the Diseases of Domestic Animals I, 272 A STUDY OF SOME SIMPLE METHODS FOR DETECTING ADULTERATION IN GHEE By NOSHIR N. DASTUR, D. R. KASHYAP and ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute Bangalore (Received for publication on 31 May 1943) THE following studies were made to investigate the possible use of simple methods for differentia- tion between pure ghee and other edible fats, espe- cially edible hydrogeneted fats (vanaspati). TILE TEST FOR GHEE Sometime ago a method of detecting adultera tion of ghee, henceforth to be called the ' Tile ' test received publicity in the press. The following was the method advocated for carrying out the test. A small quantity of ghee (a drop or two), previously warmed, was to be applied on a baked earthen surface provided by either a country tile or a piece of earthen pot. It was claimed for this method that, if the sample of ghee was adulterated with vanaspati, a white chalky deposit was left on the spot. This would not ordinarily happen with genuine ghee. From a series of preliminary trials carried out it was found that porous, evenly smooth unrealized earthenware surfaces gave the best results. The fat to be tested was usually spread lightly on the surface or rubbed hard for 15 seconds. \ill\ found that these two methods of applying fat not make any difference in the results of the test. The test was always carried out at room \ill\ ture, i.e. no attempt was made to melt the \ill\
NOSHIR N. DASTUR, D. R. KASHYAP AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 59 The results obtained with the Tile test using different types of fats are briefly summarized as follows: (a) Vegetable oils. All the edible oils tested gave negative results, i.e. left no chalky mark on the surfaces tried. (b) Vanaspati samples. In all 25 different brands of vanaspati were examined. It was found that, with a single exception, all the samples left a chalky mark on the tile. It was also noticed that this particular sample which gave the negative result was quite hard compared with the other samples of vanaspati, which were in a semisolid condition at room temperature. (c) Animal depot fats. These fats were extrac- ted from the connecting tissues by the application of heat. Cow's and goat's depot fats gave a chalky deposit, while buffalo's and pig's fats showed negative results. It may be added that at room temperature, the buffalo fat was found to be as hard as either cow or goat fat. (d) Ghee samples. In all about hundred samples of ghee were examined by the ' Tile ' test. Sam- ples were collected from almost all parts of the country with great care to ensure their genuineness. For this test, the direct use of butter instead of ghee made no difference as to its sensitivity. It was found that approximately 45 per cent of these ghee samples gave a positive result. The rest were negative. This serious defect indicates the unreliability of the test under everyday conditions. (e) Effect of heating the fats on the tile test. It was found that when vanaspati samples which gave a positive ' Tile ' test were heated to 60&deg; C. and higher, they lost the property of throwing the chalky deposit on the tiles. Melted samples were always allowed to cool to room temperature by leaving them overnight, and in some cases were even solidified by keeping them in a refrigerator before testing. This behaviour of vanaspati is a great handicap in the application of the Tile test. (f) Detection of adulteration using tile test. In view of the fact that quite a large number of gen- uine ghee samples gave a positive result, the utility of this method for the detection of adulteration of ghee, therefore, becomes very doubtful. These results suggest that the positive results given by most of the vanaspati samples and other fats is due to the peculiar physical condition at the time of their examination rather than to any in- herent characteristic. PRESENCE OF NICKEL IN VANASPATI A study to estimate the nickel content of vanaspati was undertaken. Any results of a simi- lar study, if carried out in India, have not been published. If nickel is found to be present in vanaspati in considerable proportions due to faulty] methods employed in its manufacture, the test could then be utilized for the detection of such vanaspati if added to ghee. For detecting the presence of nickel, an acid extract of the fats under test was prepared by the method recommended by Atack [1913] using Fortini's reagent as follows : 50 gm. of fat were weighed in a flask and 20 ml. of concentrated HCl added to it. The mixture was heated with frequent shaking and then allowed to stand. The TABLE I Samples. Bellier-Kries reaction Remarks.

After cooling, 1 ml. of Fortini's reagent was put over the ash and the development of colour noted. The silica dish was covered and left for 24 hours to note any develop- ment of the characteristic pink colour. Fortini's reagent as used in the above tests was made by adding an equal volume of liquor ammonia to a saturated solution of dimethylglyoxine in absolute alcohol. All the samples of vanaspati tested by this method gave a negative result for nickel. BELLIER-KRIES TEST This test was carried out with fat samples of different origins to see if there was a clear demarca- tion between ghee and other fats. The test was carried out by shaking 5 ml. of the liquid fat with 5 ml. of concentrated, colourless, nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) and 5 ml. of a 0.1 per cent solution of phloroglucinol in ether. The mixture was shaken and allowed to separate in two layers. Results for ghee and vanaspati samples are given in Table I. These results show that there is no sharp de. marcation between the colour shown by ghee and vanaspati. Hence, the possibility of devising a test for differentiating between vanaspati and ghee on the basis of the Bellier-Kries reaction seems very remote. CONCLUSIONS The ' Tile' test, Dimethylglyoxine test for nickel and Bellier-Kries reaction do not make a sharp differentiation between ghee and vanaspati. Hence, they cannot be employed for detecting adulteration in ghee. REFERENCE Atack, F. W. (1913). Analyst 38, 316 SOME NEW RECORDS OF NEMATODE WORMS FROM INDIAN RUMINANTS By M. M. SARWAR, L.V.P., Research Assistant, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute Izatnagar (Received for publication, on 28 June 1943) THE worms under record were collected on post mortem from a four-months-old local dairy calf of Hriana breed, a one-year old buffalo calf recently purchased from a village in the Bareilly district and a sheep that died naturally at Izat- nagar. The dairy calf harboured more than 5,000 worms of the species, Mecistocirrus digitatus, Cooperia punctata and Cooperia pectinata. Mecis- tocirrus digitatus is by far the most common worm infesting cattle in India and is considered to be responsible for parasitic gastritis in calves. Sheather [1919] described what was evidently this species and considered it responsible for deaths among calves in a dairy herd. The calf under consideration had been dosed thrice with copper sulphate and iron sulphate during its illness which lasted about a month. The worms when fresh were dark-brown in colour, and under the micros- cope their intestines were found tinged greenish- blue, the worms on the whole presenting an un- usual appearance. This was probably due to the drugs administered to the calf. Cooperia pectinata and Cooperia punctata were reported for the first time by Rao [1940] from south India. Bhalerao [1942] reported them from a hill-bull at Mukteswar. The present findings are recorded from plains cattle in northern India. The high infestation in the locally-bred calf and the presence of C. punctata in the buffalo calf, from the same district suggest the possibility of considerable infestations of cattle with these worms. C. punctata, Paracooperia nodulosa, Bunosto- mum phlebotomum and a Capillaria sp. were obtained from the buffalo calf, and none of them has previously been recorded from buffaloes. Oesophagostomum indicum was collected from the sheep referred to above. Paracooperia nodulosa [Schwartz 1929] Schwartz [1929] described a parasite from the intestines of a carabao (Bubalus bubalis) which he called Cooperia nodulosa. The material was sent to him from the Philippines by Dr Gomez with the information that the animal was extremely emaciated and had died of inanition. On post mortem, the small intestines were found to con- tain nodules throughout its length and the teased preparations revealed round worms.
M. M. SARWAR 61 Schwartz described the nodules as conspi- cuously-raised bodies, varying from about 3 to 5 mm. in diameter, the summit of each nodule being more or less depressed and containing a small opening. Each nodule contained a single worm which was somewhat deeply embedded in the mucosa. On this evidence, he stated that the worm should be regarded as pathogenic and pos- sibly of economic importance. The intestines of the calf was found studded with nodules resembling those described by Schwartz, their number being about 20 per foot of the in- testines. The nodules presented a greenish ap- pearance when fresh. The description of the parasite is based on indivi- duals obtained free in the lumen of the intestines. Travassos [1937] transferred the species C. nodulosa to his newly created genus Paracooperia. The following points have been studied from 10 individuals collected. The head, varying in diameter from 0.06 to 0.065 mm. bears the papillae described by Schwartz. The oesophagus varies in length from 0.3 to 0.45 mm. and has a diameter of 0.3 to 0.45 mm. at its greatest breadth. The male is about 9 mm. long and has a dia- meter of about 0.14 mm. at the anterior ends of the spicules. The appearance of the bursal rays is in agreement with Schwartz' description, save that the dorsal ray does not always present a bifid appearance at its branches. In one individual the right branch of the dorsal ray, besides giving off the lateral branch, bears a ray-like structure in the angle formed by the origin of the lateral branch. This structure is absent in the corres- ponding left branch, while the main branch has a bifid appearance. The spicules are from 0.25 mm. to 0.28 mm. long, differing in this respect from 0.304SELECTED ARTICLES THE EXPLOITATION OF STRAW FOR FOOD By MAJOR G. WILLIAMSON,* O.B.E., Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, Edinburgh (Reproduced from The Journal of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, Vol. 12, No. 4, August 1941) IN normal times, or at least in times of peace cereal straws are used as food for animals to an important extent only in the backward agricul- tural areas of the world ; elsewhere the main func- tion of straw in agricultural economy is to form a basis for the production of manure. It thus hap- pens that those who are the chief users of straw as forage are in no position to exploit modern know- ledge in an endeavour to realize its full potentiali- ties, while to those who could do so the subject generally is of little importance because they have easy access to richer sources of nourishment. When these sources are denied to them and when perhaps because of difficulties of transport and an urgent demand for fats, the handling of material with a high oil and protein content is undertaken more readily than is that of the more carbonaceous foods, then the latter, being at hand, has its value much enhanced, while the deficiency of protein with which it may be associated and which in normal times makes it economically worthless, is then of less moment. It is, in fact, such conditions, or the possibility of such conditions, that have turned the attention of nutritionists to a study of the means of extracting from straw its maximum use as food. A glance at the table below is sufficient to show the nature of the problem involved : Composition of the cereal straws Straw Chemical composition Digestible constituents Ash Starch equiva- lent Pro- tein Oil Carbo- hydrates Pro- tein Oil Carbo- hydrates Solu- ble Fibre Solu- ble Fibre Oats (Winter) . . 1.9 1.5 43.1 34.6 0.5 0.5 19.8 19.7 4.9 21 Oats (Spring) . . 2.9 1.9 42.4 33.9 0.9 0.6 19.4 18.3 4.9 20 Barley . . . 3.3 1.8 42.4 33.9 0.7 0.6 22.5 18.3 4.6 23 Wheat (Winter) . 2.1 1.3 40.7 36.6 0.5 0.4 15.0 18.3 5.3 13 Wheat (Spring) . 2.9 1.3 39.8 35.9 0.5 0.4 14.7 18.0 6.1 13 First, one sees how comparatively rich the straws are in carbohydrates but how poorly these car- bohydrates are utilized by the animal and how that low digestibility applies not only to fibre but also to the soluble carbohydrates. Again, one sees immediately that little of the protein and fat is digestible, but that at any rate the quantity of these constituents is so small that they have little significance from a feeding point of view. The amount of ash is of some importance and more, important still is the amount of silica which it contains. Although the total amount of minerals in straw is somewhat less than that contained in hay, its nature is very different because silica generally forms a quarter to a third of the straw ash, that is 1 to 2 per cent of the total composition, while the quantity of lime and phosphoric acid in it is negligible. Straw thus can be made useful as a food only when the digestibility of the carbohydrates can be very considerably raised. To do that it is neces- sary to appreciate the conditions which account for their low digestibility. In the first place, as the analysis shows, more than half of the carbohydrates is composed of crude fibre. This crude fibre con- sists primarily of cellulose and other complex poly- saccharides, the most important of which are lignin and cutin. The lignin and cutin envelop and impregnate the cellulose, forming as it were a vegetable skeleton as well as a protective covering. The crux of the question lies in the manner in which these substances are dealt with in the intesti- nal tract, for if they are not broken down the material which they enfold must remain unaffected by the digestive juices. Pure cellulose is comparatively well digested by herbivora but not so by other types of feeders because its digestion depends not upon the action of intestinal enzymes as does that of other car- bohydrates but on the action of the enzymes of * At present Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India 62
G. WILLIAMSON 63 symbiotic micro-organisms which themselves are closely associated with the food. Thus the nature and number of cellulose-splitting organisms found in the intestine at any given time depends upon the extent to which plant food has formed part of the diet previously, and the extent of their action in a large measure depends upon the facilities offered for their contact with the food over a pro- longed period such as occurs in the rumen of cattle and in the cæcum and colon of the horse. If the cellulose is encrusted with such material as lignin, cutin, silica, etc. their insoluble nature prevents the action of either digestive juices or bacteria, making the digestion of cellulose impossible and denies, even to the ruminant, the use of the other nutrients contained in it. One of the features of the ageing of all grasses is the proportionate increase in cellulose, and in the lignification of its cellulose characterized by the rigidity and brittleness of its stem, so that as the plant gains maturity the amount of lignocellulose composing it rapidly multiplies. The cereal grasses are no exception to the rule, and as it is so important in the harvesting of the grain that there hould be tno lodging of the plants, those varieties having straw of a stiff nature which can thus with- stand rough weather conditions are favoured in most districts. By far the commonest factor governing the amount of lignification of straw, however, is the stage at which the crop is cut. In the straw of the unripe oat, for instance, the crude- fibre content may be as low as 29.5 per cent or even lower, but when the same straw has been cut in a completely matured condition the fibre may have almost doubled in amount and the lignin, which in the former condition may have been al- most absent, will in the latter case be present in large amounts. The shorter the period of growth the less will the process of lignification have pro- ceeded. Of cereals, only oats are habitually cut in the unripe state, and it is for this reason that oat straw can without treatment form a useful food even for horses. On analysis, barley straw may appear to be superior to oat straw, but it is less palatable; wheat straw and rye straw are very much inferior and are useless as a food for horses64 Exploitation of Straw for Food real. Costly equipment was needed and a level of intelligence required for its application which pre- cluded its use by other than at least semi-skilled labour. At a specialized central depot, however, where a plant was installed which was capable of dealing with large quantities, a material of high feeding value was produced at a cost which was not unduly great, that is when the treated straw or ' straw pulp' was used in its wet state. But therein lay the difficulty, because the water content of the pulp is very high, the transport of water is expensive, the process of drying is costly, and the semi-dried material is a favourable medium for the growth of moulds. The straw could then be used only in an area in proximity to the plant, in order to avoid the difficulties of transport and storage. The usefulness of this method of treating straw under factory conditions was thus greatly restrict- ed, but, all the same, during the last European War many large-scale plants were installed in Germany. As a result of the intensive study of the subject which was undertaken at that time, it was found that there was no necessity to carry the digestion of straw to the extent done in the paper industry. There the complete removal of the indigestible enveloping substances is aimed at and is achieved only at the expense of large amounts of organic material or potential food. Fairly strong concen- trations of alkali and pressure steaming are the means adopted to that end. To greatly increase the food value of straw it is sufficient to disrupt the incrusting material and to spring the ligno-cellulose bond ; in the process, the silica may be separated and dissolved and the methoxy and acetyl group split off the lignin molecule. It was discovered that this could be attained quite well when weak solutions of caustic were used, and it was also de- monstrated that steaming at high pressure was not necessarily beneficial. Thus the expensive high- pressure process was discarded in favour of the use of weak alkali solution at low pressure. The re- sulting product is of an acid or neutral reaction because sufficient acetic acid is formed from the liberated acetyl group to neutralize the compara- tively small amount of alkali. The process was in the meantime carried a step farther when cooking in open vats was advocated. A stronger solution of caustic soda was, however, employed and the treated straw had to be freed from alkali by wash- ing before it could be fed. In washing there was an unavoidable loss of organic material which went far to offset the benefits which the simplified process otherwise afforded. At Leeds in 1917 Godden, making use of the lessons already learnt on the Continent, devised a simple process which could be used on the farm. He recommended that chopped straw should be soaked overnight in a 1.5 per cent solution of caustic soda, and on removal from the solution it should be well drained and put into a steamer, such as forms a fairly common piece of equipment on a modern farm. The particular one he devised consisted of a vertical iron boiler with a loose cover and fitted with a pipe which delivered steam near the base. Steam was blown through the soaked straw in this tank until the whole mass was at boiling-point, steaming being continued for an hour. The treated straw was allowed to drain and cool before being fed. It required no washing, because the soda had been sufficiently neutralized during the steaming. He showed that there was, on the whole, about 50 per cent gain in feeding value. While Godden was doing this work in England, Beckmann introduced his method which differed radically from all the previous ones in that it did not involve the use of heat. He proved, too, that even under such conditions a weak solution of alkali was as effective for the purpose in hand as a strong solution and that the time required for its action was comparatively short. In spite of the fact that by his process final washing of the straw is required, the method is so simple and so econo- mical that it quickly superseded all the others. The hydrolysis of the straw is carried out with eight times its weight of 1.5 per cent solution of caustic soda for three hours, the fluid is then run off and the residue washed with water until it is neutral to litmus. The results of feeding trials, digestibility and metabolism experiments show that, in general, for ruminants, the nature of the improvement in food value is in the region of 100 per cent. Hydrolysis of straw can be accomplished with material other than caustic sodaG. WILLIAMSON 65 sodium hydroxide solution, a volume of fresh water is run on to it until the basin is brimful. The heavy caustic solution lies practically undiluted at the bottom of the basin and is now by a simple but ingenious system of piping syphoned off to the neighbouring basin for use on the next consign- ment of straw, while the head of water which has permitted the syphoning of the soda is diverted to an outside channel as is the water with which the straw continues to bo washed until it has lost all feeling of soapiness. That process may take from one to three hours, depending upon the rate at which the water is being passed through. The straw is then fit for immediate feeding, but is usually allowed to drain for an hour or two in order to get rid of surplus fluid. The caustic solution which has been syphoned into the second basin is made up to the original strength and volume and the process is repeated. The other type of plant is yet more simple, but involves a somewhat greater amount of work. It consists of two tanks separated by a drainage platform. After the chopped straw has been soaked in one tank it is ladled on to the platform from where the surplus lye runs back to the tank from where it was lifted. The straw is then shovel- led into the second tank, where it is washed by successive steepings in water or by a continuous stream of water. Again, it is generally found to be advisable to drain the surplus liquid from the straw before feeding. In either plant there is some difficulty experienced in the initial soaking, but that is overcome by means of sectional wooden frames over which half-inch wire netting is spread. These are placed on the straw, and with the help of heavy concrete weights they press the straw down into the solution. The action of the caustic solution on the straw is most intensive for a comparatively short period during the first hour or two. Beckmann himself considered that three hours was the optimum time for soaking, but the process of digestion actually continues after the first three hours, although pro- gress then is very slow. In practice it often proves convenient to soak the straw overnight and wash it first thing in the morning. The process will certainly have gone as far as desirable by twenty hours with the temperature at 45&deg;F., but if the weather is cold and the temperature at, say, freez- ing-point, the straw must be exposed to the action of the salt for very much longer if the same degree of digestion is to be attained. As indicated, however, something considerably short of twenty hours is sufficient for practical purposes. The amount of water required for washing is about four gallons for each pound of straw. The time required to handle 200 lb. of straw by one man is three-quarters of an hour. The all-in cost of the treatment at present prices in Britain is in the region of £3 per ton. The straw is generally fed in the wet state and when stock have once become used to it they eat it readily. Some animals take to it at once, but other individuals come to it more slowly. We have, however, seen cattle, coming straight from good grazing, accept the pulped straw almost immediately, and we have seen horses accustomed to good rye-grass hay readily accept the treated straw in its place. There is, however, no reason on the score of palatability why the straw should not be dried and stored. During the drying pro- cess, however, when the material is damp rather than wet, it is liable to ferment and become musty, but once that stage, so favourable to the growth of moulds, has passed the treated straw will keep as well as it did before treatment. As already indicated, the treatment more or less doubles the starch equivalent value of the straw for ruminants66 Phenothiazine as an Anthelmintic in Horses amount of water used, the cost of chopping the straw and the difficulty of handling such bulky material, the cost of the plant, etc. The answer to these objections lies either in the monetary value of the final product or in the necessity of producing the food irrespective of its cost. Let us say at once that it was probably the latter consideration which stimulated the intensive research on the subject which was carried out in Germany during the last war, and that even Beckmann's process is unlikely to prove economical in times of plenty, when natural highly nutritious forage is at hand in abundance. It is not difficult, however, to visua- lize conditions either in war or peace when the treatment of straw for food might become of great importance. A shortage of fodder may be secon- dary only in time of a shortage of food for man, and it is not an infrequent companion of an army, even a mechanized one-in fact, one may say that it is sooner or later inevitable in a war zone. But even in peace time the conditions following natural calamities may make it of vital importance that material on the spot should be exploited to the full. Even under normal conditions, such as apply in certain districts of Asia and Africa where straw is relied upon to a large extent to maintain an enor- mous head of cattle over the greater part of the year, a process of treatment might find a place, as that of Beckmann does in Europe. In our own sphere is it not conceivable that an economic method might be evolved whereby the grass straw issued under the flattering term of ' hay ' to the Army in India might have its value increased so that it did more accurately answer to its official designation ? That the term ' grass straw' is more appropriate to such forage than ' hay ' or ' grass hay ' will be conceded by all those who are familiar with the methods by which it is saved. If there should be any doubt as to its true nature the chemical analysis and the digesti- bility trials conducted by Lander [1937] will dispel it. Calculated on his data, the hay from military grass farms in the Punjab has the following composition: Chemical analysis Digestible nutrittents Crude protein . 4.4 1.6 Fat . 1.3 0.4 Soluble carbohydrates . 38.21 18.30 Fibre . 38.2 23.3 Ash . . . . 9.48 The starch equivalent of hay at eleven of the principal stations in India, according to Sen, [1938] is 21.5 per cent. The same author found wheat bhoosa to have a starch equivalent of 22.1 per cent. These figures apply to ruminants and their equivalent for horses is probably much lower. It would, of course, be quite wrong to suggest that methods of treating straw which are applicable to temperate climates would also be suitable in the tropics. The shortage of water and often the shortage of fuel alone make conditions quite differ- ent, but, on the other hand, the density of animal population at certain centres, the necessity of maintaining them on straw throughout the year, and the abundance of labour, among other consi- derations, allow one to suppose that attempts to evolve a system suitable for such localities might be worthy of consideration.

SLOANE (Reprinted from the Veterinary Record, Vol. 52, No. 36, September 7, 1940) OBJECT OF INVESTIGATION THE object of the investigation was to determine (1) THE efficiency of the drug as an anthelmintic (2) A simple method of administration of the drug. (3) The reaction of the animal to the drug. (4) The minimum effective dose. SELECTION OF ANIMALS The first batch of horses examined had been in the barrack stables sometime prior to the out- break of the war. The subsequent examinations were made on remounts ; these horses were from units in various parts of England and Scotland and the majority had been newly acquired by the Army. Each animal was subjected to a routine examina- tion and weighed, and special attention was paid to the teeth faeces and blood. The drug was not given to any animal that showed any deviation of temperature or pulse. Apparent poor condition was not always an indication that the animal had a high infestation of helminths, and, conversely, neither was good condition invariably an indication of a low infes- tation. It was discovered that many of the * An investigation conducted under the co-ordination of The Helminths Committee (Animals Section) of the Agricultural Research Council.
T. GRAHAME, D. O. MORGAN AND J. E. N. SLOANE 67 debilitated poor ' doers' had a low or almost negative count, whereas many animals which appeared to be in ' good condition' were heavily infested ; these animals were treated. Practically all the horses, whether in good or bad condition, improved and gained in weight following the administration of the drug. All the animals chosen were infected with strongyles and occasionally with ascarids. ADMINISTRATION OF THE DRUG The data on the use of phenothiazine as an anthelmintic in the horse is somewhat scanty, and the dosage, method of administration, etc. re- quired further investigation. The first doses given in the present series were based on 5 gm. per 50 lb. body weight, which usually worked out at approximately 100 gm. for the average cavalry horse. One hundred gm. of phenothiazine is a bulky mass and its administration offered a problem. The powder is not miscible in water, but may be suspended and given by stomach tube. The administration of the powder in the food was tried with success. The procedure was to feed a bran mash mixed with treacle, followed at the next meal by a similar feed with which the powder was mixed. Some animals reluctantly ate the mixture, while others, especially the ' particular feeder,' left it. The following method was found to be the most satisfactory. The animals were made to miss a feed, and then an ordinary bran mash containing the powder was given. In almost every case the feed was eaten, and there was no difficulty when a little boiled oats was added. It was the usual practice to treat the animals at the week-end, missing the Saturday morning feed and giving a meal containing the powder at the mid-day feed. In this manner the usual routine of work was not interfered with. The animals were at their usual work on Monday, having suffered no apparent inconvenience. However, to prevent the working of any horse that might be particularly sensitive to the action of the drug, each animal was examined every morning for a week subsequent to the administration of the medicine. REACTIONS OF THE DRUG Some interesting observations were made which seem to have a bearing upon the distribution and possible ' breakdown ' of the drug in the body system, although some horses showed little or no departure from the normal. (1) The conjunctival mucous membranes were stained a yellowish colour and occasionally the mucous membranes of the mouth and anus were similarly coloured. The yellow coloration ap- peared after 24 hours and sometimes became more intense, but gradually faded out. In some, the coloration disappeared in a few days, but in others it persisted for seven to eight days and even longer. The mucous membranes of the mouth and anus were stained a faint yellow, very much less intense than that of the conjunctiva. (2) The urine of some horses was viscid and coloured a reddish brown. Attention is drawn to this condition by the staining of the bedding and floor of the stable, and by the red- bespeckled hind limbs, especially noticed when the limbs have white markings. The coloured excretions may persist for two to four days. In several animals, the urine remained coloured for several days before a clearance was effected. Those unaware of this action of the drug might be alarmed and consider the reaction unfavourably. Analysis of the urine did not show any unusual ingredients, other than might be expected from the ' breakdown ' of the drug. Technique. To measure the anthelmintic effi- cacy of the drug, egg counts were carried out before and after dosing. The modified stoll dilution method was used throughout: 5 gm. of faeces were weighed out into a jar graduated at 75 c.c. and N.10 NaOH added up to the 75 c.c. mark. The sample was left overnight to soften, and after shaking and sieving to remove coarse debris, 0.15 c.c. was removed by means of a Macdonald pipette. All the eggs in the 0.15 c.c. were counted and the process was repeated three or four times, and the average count taken. The figure obtained, multiplied by 100, gave the number of eggs per gm. of the original sample. Eggs of Parascaris equorum were counted separately from those of strongyle worms. The faeces were taken direct from the rectum of each horse. Explanation of Tables. Where a count of 30 eggs appears in the tables, this indicates that only one egg was seen in the three slides examined. A plus sign in the tables indicates that no eggs were found by the above counting technique, but that a concentration method using about 5 gm. of faeces revealed a few eggs. Owing to the transfer of horses, some irregularity occurred in respect of the intervals of time between the three counts after dosing. In Tables I, II, III, VII and VIII, the counts were made at approxi- mately two, four and six weeks after dosing, and in Tables IV, VI, IX and X at two, three and four weeks. In Table V, only one count was obtained, and this was taken at four weeks. In every case where a third count was obtained, it was taken at not less than four weeks after the date of dosing.

70 Treatment of Equine Strongylosis DISCUSSION After doses ranging from 30 to 100 gm. the first two egg-counts were negligible, except in a very few cases. In the third count, on the other hand, a slight rise was found in the majority of cases. This figure however, is very small in comparison with the count before dosing and is no more than might be expected in view of the lapse of time between the times of dosing and the third count. The increase may be explained by the maturing of larvae which were in the tissues at the time of dosing, and which had returned to the lumen of the gut in the interval. Doses of less than 30 gm. however, did not produce comparable results, although a notable reduction in the egg-count was recorded, for the 25 gm. group of approximately 80 per cent, and for the 20 gm. group of 40 per cent. In these two groups the second and third egg-counts show a rapid increase, and it would seem that while the drug did not kill all the worms, neverthe- less it affected the egg-laying activities of the female, for a period of nearly three weeks. On the evidence set forth in the above table the minimum effective dose is considered to be approximately 30 gm. Only 11 horses of the total of 95 treated, har- boured Parascaris equorum, and infestations were light in all cases. No definite conclusions can therefore be drawn from these observations con- cerning the value of the drug against this parasite, and although the egg-counts from six of the animals were negative after treatment, the other results were erratic. CONCLUSIONS (1) It would appear from the results given in the above tables of egg-counts and from the improve- ments observed in the general condition of the animals treated that phenothiazine has distinct merits as an anthelmintic for strongyles in horses, (2) The average weight of the horses treated in the above experiment was approximately 1,000 lb., and the effective minimum dose was 30 gm. This represents 1 gm. of phenothiazine per 33 lb. of body weight. (3) In view of the fact that phenothiazine may be given in the feed of the horse with little previous preparation of the animal it has obvious advant- ages over drugs requiring long preliminary fasting and more elaborate methods of administration. (4) No evidence was obtained of any untoward reactions, and although slight malaise was observed in two or three animals, this may have been due to individual idiosyncrasy. (5) The drug has the additional value that it does not interfere with the normal working of the horse. (6) The foregoing conclusions suggest that regular periodic dosing with phenothiazine might provide a safe and easy method for the control, if not the complete eradication of strongyles in horses.

C. Laboratory, Aldershot (Reprinted from the Veterinary Record, Vol. 52, No. 36, September 7, 1940) AT the suggestion of E. L. Taylor, D.V.Sc. D.V.H., M.R.C.V.S., Senior Research Officer of the Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Fisheries, Weybridge, it was decided to carry out trials at the Royal Army Veterinary Corps Laboratory to test the efficacy of the anthelmintic drug thiodiphenylamine, also known as pheno- thiazine, for the treatment of strongylosis in horses. This drug has proved very effective against stomach worms in sheep and would appear to exert more effect than any preparation previously tried for the removal of worms from the large intestine of sheep. It was thought, therefore that phenothiazine might prove an efficient expel- lant of strongyles from the horse. Three horses were selected for these observa- tions : (1) No. 110. Bay Mare, 7 years old. Rider. Condition moderate. (2) No. 47 . Bay Mare, 7 years old. Rider. Condition moderate. (3) No. 94313. Black Mare, aged. Rider. Condition poor. For the purpose of this trial egg counts of the faeces were made by Stoll's method before and after the treatment, and were continued for 21 days after administration of the drug. The results of these counts are shown in table on next yage.

They were selected as the most suitable cases at our limited disposal for this observation. The phenothiazine was supplied by Dr. Taylor in tablet and in powder form. In two instances the drug was administered by stomach tube and in the third by mixing with the food. When the tablets were used these were finely ground before administration. On mixing with water phenothiazine tends to sediment rather rapidly, but we found that by keeping the suspension constantly stirred during administration no sediment remained when given by the stomach tube. The dru was given in one gallon of warm water, The other method of administration consisted of mixing the drug with food. For this purpose a quarter bucket of warm bran mash was prepared and the powder well mixed with it. Although the mare selected for this trial had been fasted for 24 hours previously she did not regard the feed favourably, ate about a third of the mash and refused to take more. When, however, a double handful of oats was added to the remainder of the mash she rather reluctantly finished it. It has been suggested that horses may be induced to take the drug more readily by giving them small amounts of treacle, bran and oats for a few days previously and then mixing the powdered drug with this food when it is readily taken. In further trials it is proposed to employ this method. As far as dosage is concerned, two horses received 60 gm. and one 100 gm. of phenothiazine.
72 ABSTRACTS The smaller doses, judging from the egg counts, appeared to be just as effective as larger ones, but as we were only dealing with comparatively light infestations the same rule may not apply to heavy invasions. No ill effects were noticed after administration, there was no softening of the faeces, no rise in temperature and the appetite was unaffected. In each case three worm egg counts were carried out on separate days before administration. Red-tinged urine was observed in each horse on the day after the administration of the drug. This pigmentation disappeared in about 48 hours. The red coloration is due, not to the presence of blood, but to a colour reaction derived from the drug. The horses were prepared by fasting for 24 hours before administration, after which they received only warm bran mashes for a further 24 hours, and then reverted to ordinary diet. A naked-eye search for parasites was carried out on all dung passed after the drug was given. No special apparatus was employed for this purpose the pellets merely being broken down and care- fully examined. A few parasites were observed in all three cases, these appearing upon the second- or third day after administration and persisting until the fifth day. Specimens were despatched for classification to Dr. Taylor, who identified them as Strongyles edentatus, Strongylus vulgaris and Trichonema. In two of the horses two species of Strongyles were observed only, in the third horse all three species were present. Egg counts were taken and observations were recorded for a period of 21 days after administra- tion. It will be seen from the tabulated record that in addition to the expulsion of adult worms the drug was completely effective in removing ova of Strongylidae from the faeces, as in the counts taken prior to administration eggs were present in, at any rate, appreciable numbers. It must be noted that in our previous experiences with the use of anthelmintic drugs for the treatment of strongylosis of horses, although a reduction in the number of ova in the faeces was brought about after a time the number again increased. It will, there- fore, be necessary to make observations over a longer period than has been done in these experi- ments and to consider the advisability of giving a second or even a third dose of the drug. As an anthelmintic for strongylidae in horses the results appear to be very encouraging and would justify the carrying out of trials upon a more extensive scale. In comparison with other an- thelmintics used for the treatment of strongylosis in horses phenothiazine appears up to the present to have a decided advantage in being harmless to the patient. The question as to whether or not a purgative could be usefully employed in combination with this drug is a matter for further consideration. ABSTRACTS Artificial insemination and the veterinary surgeon with special reference to cattle. N. J. SCORGIE (1943). Veterinary Record 55, 56 THE basic research leading to the modern development of artificial insemination was first initiated by Elick Ivenoff, a Russian physiologist in 1899, as a result of which active work on this branch of science in the field, which began in 1923, made it possible for breeding of millions of cattle, horses, goats and pigs in the U.S.S.R. Organized artificial breeding on large scale collective farms in the U.S.S.R. was largely facilitated by conditions peculiar to the Russian stock-raising system. As a result thereof in 1938, 50 million farm animals were inseminated which greatly speeded up livestock improve- ment and the introduction of new types. Similarly in Denmark, where the first co-operative breeding society was formed, progress was recorded and in Itlay two institu- tions were set up by Government to study the technique of the operations and associated problems. In Kenya a rapid extension of this method of breeding took place in 1938-39 mainly with a view to lowering the pre- valence of genital diseases transmitted by coitus. At the end of 1941, 36 farms, with a total number of 15,003 breeding females and 158 bulls, were practising artificial breeding. These figures represented 23 per cent and 6.9 per cent of the total cow and bull population. The prompt and widespread adoption of insemination had saved the dairy industry serious loss from genital diseases. Out of these 36 farms, 24 farms involving 11,910 cows had adopted this practice because of the existence of infection in these herds, and the rest involving 3,093 cows, i.e., 20.6 per cent of the total, and 40 bulls representing 25.3 per cent for reasons of economy of bulls. On an average 1.88 inseminations were required per conception. In the United States of America dairy cattle breeders have clearly recognized the economic enefits and other advantages of artificial breeding, and almost without exception the American Associations, which are 54 in number spread over 22 States, have arisen as a result of real demand for this service by breeders themselves. The principal objects of artificial insemination are classed under (a) livestock improvement, (b) disease con- trol and (c) breeding efficiency. Livestock improvement can be effected by the use of a limited number of first- class bulls available for mating with many more times the number of females than would be possible under natural conditions. For example, in Russia as many as 1,538 cows were inseminated from the semen of one bull in one year producing 1,490 calves, and 15,016 ewes were
ABSTRACTS 73 similarly inseminated with successful results. First-class sires, in other words proven sires, whose ability to trans- mit desirable characters has been determined, are very few ; for in dairy practice the majority of sires are never proved owing to their destruction or decay before their worth has become known. Generally a bull reaches the age of 5 or 6 years before even the first of his daughters comes into production, and it takes a few more years before there is a sufficient number of daughters to indi- cate his value as a transmitter. With co-operative artificial breeding, it has become possible to have a suffi- cient number of daughters to prove a bull earlier than under natural conditions. Due to the progress made in the storage and transport of semen, the mating of widely separated animals has been brought within the realm of reality. In the operation of artificial breeding no mating involv- ing actual contact of animals takes place, and therefore the danger of dissemination of certain contagious diseases, viz. trichomoniasis, infectious vaginitis, contagious abortion and metritis, is entirely avoided. Artificial insemination under large-scale field conditions used rationally or in conjunction with expert diagnosis by veterinary surgeons can play an important role in the control of certain well-defined reproductory disorders of livestock. Apart from the control of venereal diseases ensured by the strict and regular examination of bulls by veterinary surgeons, sterility in cows due to anatomical deformity can be easily overcome by artificial breeding. With cows which fail to breed after repeated services, it is desirable to try artificial insemination before recommending their destruction. During extreme cold weather breeding bulls have been noticed to suffer from temporary sterility or low breeding efficiency which is said to be associated with vitamin C deficiency. This condition is often not detected until a large number of cows have been covered, and this causes a considerable disturbance of the breeding programmes. It is an advantage, therefore, to be able to collect the semen of these bulls by means of an artificial vagina and test it, as soon as the condition is suspected. Some recent work in the U.S.S.R. indicates the possi- bility of artificial determination of sex by the separation of male and female-determining sperms by the method of electrophoresis, i.e. accumulation of male and female- determining sperms in cathode and anode respectively. The success of this method will have a striking effect on the future development of dairying and animal industry. It was not until 1933 that the first detailed account of the progress and technique of artificial insemination was published in Great Britian by Walton, who himself is now acknowledged to be one of the leading authorities in this field. The application of artificial insemination on organized lines in Great Britain offers great possibilities in live-stock improvement in that it provides the small farmers, who are responsible for producing one half of the total milk yield, with the use of a much better sire than they could individually own and thus the non-pedigree breeders will have the opportunity of grading up their stock. Results observed in the U.S.A. and Denmark appear to indicate that the suggestion of a possible adverse effect of artificial insemination on the trade of pedigree sires in Great Britain is without any foundation, but on the contrary it will provide an incentive to breeders who are eager to improve their important stocks for post-war periods. The con- templated legislation by the Ministry of Agriculture to safeguard the successful establishment of this practice by restraining its use to properly authorized persons in all cases and the need for close scrutiny of breeding bulls to be used for fertility and quality indicate that the veteri- nary surgeon, in virtue of his training and experience, is eminently suited to supervise the work of organized arti- ficial breeding. In Great Britian there is evidence of growing interest amongst small breeders and dairy farmers as to the necessity of organized artificial breeding. This is borne out by the fact that two schemes for the formation of artificial breeding centres at Cambridge and Reading have been approved by the Ministry of Agricul- ture. Similarly private schemes and those sponsored by breed societies are being launched in co-operation with the veterinary profession. [S.K.S.] The effect of processing on the nitrogen distribu- tion in milk. S. G. MENEFEE, O. R. OVERMANN and P. H. TRACY (1941). J. Dairy Sci. 11, 953-68 ROWLAND'S simi-micro procedure for the determina- tion of total casein, non-casein, non-protein, globulin, albumin and proteose nitrogen was adopted for some processed milks which gave the following results with the mixed herd milk. (1) Homogenization of skim milk, 4 per cent whole milk and 8 per cent whole milk at normal (2,500 lb.) and abnormal (3,500 and 5,000 lb.) pressures gave no significant changes in the nitrogen distribution. (2) Forewarming of milk at 203&deg;F. before condensing coagu- lated all the albumin which is co-precipitated with casein at a pH 4.6, with the casein causing high results for this fraction. This change is significant in all samples of condensed milk. (3) In evaporated milk the significant changes are the coagulation of albumin and most of the globulin, and an increase in non-casein nitrogen indicating hydrolysis of casein nitrogen. (4) Conden ed skim milk gave minor changes in the nitrogen distribution. (5) Holder pasteurization (145&deg;F. for 30 minutes) of milk produced no changes in nitrogen distribution (6) Re- pasteurization of skim milk at 190&deg;F. for 30 minutes coagulated all the albumin. (7) In cultured milk slight hydrolysis of casein occurred. Pasteurized skim milk was re-pasteurized for 30 minutes at 190&deg; F. and cooled to 70&deg;F. and starter was added at the rate of 1 quart of starter to 25 gallons of milk. The milk was kept over- night. This cultured milk (acidity 0.79 per cent) was analysed on the next day. A decrease in casein nitrogen occurred which was attributed to slight hydrolysis. The buffers used (sodium acetate and acetic acid) in the deter- mination of non-casein nitrogen and proteose peptone (plus non-protein nitrogen) tend to function efficiently in sepa- rating the protein fractions in the cultured milk, regard- less of the high acidity. The non-casein, non-protein and proteose nitrogen fractions of these products in- creased in percentage of nitrogen. Skim milk, sterilized cultured and sealed in tin cans showed results comparable with cultured milk. (8) Addition of 1 part of trypsin, Enzylac, and steapsin to 25,000 parts of 4 per cent raw milk kept at 145&deg;F. for 30 minutes produced denfinite hydrolysis of milk proteins, especially of the casein nitrogen. (9) There is no relationship between nitrogen distribution and curd tension. The raw milk, pasteu- rized milk, enzyme treated milk, homogenized milk and evaporated milk gave curd tension 57, 53, 26, 12 and zero grams respectively. Tentative official and semi-micro methods for determination of casein gave higher results than the official method which is attri- buted to the pH of the filtrates. The semi-micro method of Rowland compares favourably with the official method for the nitrogen distribution in milk. [C. P. A.]
74 ABSTRACTS The interrelationship of manganese, phosphatase and vitamin D in bone development (1942). G. F. COMBS, L. C. NORRIS and G. F. HEUSER. J. Nutr. 23, 131. THE authors demonstrated the role of manganese in bone formation by observing the effect of manganese deficiency upon bone phosphatase activity and calcifica- tion in chicks fed on rachitogenic and non-rachitogenic qiets. Two series of experiments were conducted, using Rhode Island Red chicks as the experimental animals. The results showed that the bone phosphatase activity of the chicks fed on an adequate diet, except for a lack of manganese, was markedly reduced as compared to that of chicks fed on the same diet supplemented with manganese. In rachitic chicks, it was found that the bone phosphatase activity was in- creased to almost twice the amount found in normal chicks. By omitting manganese from the rachitogenic diet, the bone phosphatase was decreased to approxi- mately the normal amount. The lowering of the bone phosphatase level in manganese deficiency shows that there is an intimate relationship between the phos- phatase activity of the bones and the manganese con- tent of the diet. The ash content of the bones of chicks fed on an adequate diet, except for a deficiency of manganese, was slightly lower than that of the bones of normal chicks. The examination of the longitudinal sections of the tibiae, after staining with silver nitrate, showed that the metaphyses of the tibiae of the chicks fed on the manganese-deficient diet were approximately one-half as wide as the metaphyses of the tibiae of the normal chicks. The epiphyses of the tibiae of the chicks fed on the manganese-deficient diet were very weakly united to the diaphyses. The results suggest that in manganese deficiency the lower- ing of the phosphatase level retards bone development with the result that the bones are shortened, the ash content of the bones is reduced and the strength of the union between the epiphysis and the diaphysis is greatly reduced. [S. B.] A filterable virus, the cause of a respiratory nervous disorder of chickens. D. E. STOVER (1942). Amer. J. Vety. Res., 3, 207. RESPIRATORY nervous disorder is a serious disease affecting young growing chickens in North California, and is caused by a filterable virus. The disease affects fowls in the age range of three to ten weeks. Some outbreaks have been observed in younger chickens and in mature hens also. The incubation period in artificially infected chicken is found to vary between two and six days, with an average of four days. The disease runs a protracted course both in the flock and in the individual bird. The respiratory and general symptoms consist of droopiness, sneezing, shaking of the head, a husky voice, gasping for breath, breathing becomes laboured as the disease progresses and the body temperature may be between subnormal and 111&deg;F. These are followed by nervous symptoms which are of three general types. They are in co-ordination of the muscles of the neck and leg, constant tremor of the body and paralysis of the legs. The post-mortem examination reveals a cloudiness of the air-sacs in the early stages, followed by oedema. The contents of the air-sacs become purulent; and adherent to the membrane are found particles of yellow caseous material. A frothy colourless serous fluid occurs in the body-cavity and the froth-covered mesentery has a cloudy or turbid appearance. A good many cases show oedema or congestion of the lungs and the presence of frothy mucus in the bronchiae and lower portion of the trachea. In a few cases bronchitis and tracheitis and the presence of a caseous material in the sinuses is noticed. Histological and macroscopical examination of the brain and nervous system failed to detect any specific lesions. The virus is found to be present in the air sacs, lungs and trachea of affected birds. The disease can be transmitted experimentally by inoculation with in- fected material intranasally, intratracheally, subcutane- ously and by injecting directly into the crop. The disease can also be transmitted by pen contact. In nature, the usual method of transmission is by the in- gestion of food and water contaminated with the excreta of sick fowls. A rapid passage of the infec- tive agent through several lots of chickens resulted in a shortening of the incubation period from an average of five days to an average of three days. Macerated saline emulsion of infective material from the air sacs, lungs and trachea were filtered through Berkefeld V, N and W filters and the filtrates inocu- lated in chickens developed the disease which demons- trated that the disease is caused by a filterable virus. Cross-immunity tests which were carried out indicat- ed that the virus of Respiratory nervous disorder is distinct from the virus of infectious bronchitis and from that of infectious laryngo-tracheitis. [P. R. K.] GIPDORIGINAL ARTICLES CLIMATIC FACTORS AS RELATED TO THE INCIDENCE OF EQUINE STRANGLES IN INDIA By F. C. MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 8 March 1944) (With 12 text-figures) IN a previous article [Minett, 1944] an account was given of the recorded incidence of strangles at the Army Remount Depots of Mona and Sargo- dha in the Shahpur District of the Punjab and at the Stud Farms of Probynabad, Coleyana and Renala in the Montgomery District of the Punjab and of Ahmednagar in Bombay. These records extend back to 1917 and 1927 in the case of Mona and Sargodha, while in the case of the stud farms they cover varying periods of years between 1914 and 1942. In that article the animal husbandry arrangements at the depots and farms were des- cribed and the problem of controlling the disease in remount depots was dealt with. In the present paper an attempt is made to throw further light on the question whether conditions of climate are in any way concerned with the prevalence of the disease at the places mentioned.

ANALYSIS OF DATA Examination of Figs. 1 to 6 Inspection of Figs. 1 and 2 shows that at the remount depots the attack rate rises sharply from September October when newly purchased young stock begin to arrive and reaches a peak in April to fall abruptly during May and June, and the rate then remains low till September. On the Punjab stud farms (Figs. 3 to 5) the curve is not so simple. There is agreement, however, in that the attack rate declines in July-August. At Coleyana and Renala the curve shows a winter rise and a sharp secondary rise between April and June. At Probynabad the rise expected in the colder months is delayed till February-March, while the secondary rise in May-June is still present. At Ahmednagar (Fig. 6), which has to be considered separately, because it is situated in an entirely different part of the country, and has a different and more equable climate, the incidence rises during the drier winter months and is much lower from April to October. The incidence may now be examined in relation to the meteorological factors. Rainfall. On the stud farms at least the declin- ing incidence curve of July and August is associa- ted with a rising rainfall. The relation to rainfall is particularly evident at Ahmednagar. Clearly it appears that monsoon conditions, even when the total rainfall is light, are not favourable to the spread of strangles. Relative humidity (8 a.m. reading). Here there is no clear connection. As we have seen, the attack rate is low during the summer monsoon when the relative humidity is, of course, fairly high. But in the winter, when the relative humidity is still comparatively high, the disease may reach the dimensions of a steady outbreak, while cases may still be appearing as late as April80 Incidence of Equine Strangles in India TABLE II Incidence of strangles by months Year Months Total Septem- ber October ovem- ber Decem- ber January February March April May June July August MONA (HORSES) 1826-27 . . .

MINETT 87 TABLE III Case incidence of strangles in horses at depots and stud farms by months Month Remount Depots Punjab88 Incidence of Equine Strangles in India Examination of Tables II and III The data have been analysed in two ways : A. Omitting October, November and March in the Punjab and May and November at Ahmednagar as being months when climatic characters are likely to be less fixed, the year was divided into seasons and the incidence figures for these months totalled as shown in Table III. The Punjab seasons taken were (i) July to September, a moder- ately wet warm period ; (ii) December to February, the cold season; (iii) April to June, the hot dry season. At Ahmednagar, (i) June to October, months of high rainfall and humidity; (ii) De- cember to April, a dry period with a distinctly lower mean minimum temperature than June to October. Table III shows, firstly, that in the Punjab the attack rate is invariably lower from July to Sep- tember than at any other time, though at Mona and Sargodha, as stated, this may not mean much. Secondly, the difference between the percentage figures, 57.3 and 38.0, for Mona and Sargodha for the periods DecemberF. C. MINETT 89 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 7.

MINETT 91 Since the position in respect of Coleyana (Figs. 9 to 12) is not so clear, it may be helpful to examine the figs. in the light of the following remarks. Fig. 9. Prior to the sharp outbreak begin- ning on January 31 with 18 cases in five days the minimum temperature had ranged from 34 to 48&deg;F. During the following monsoon there were only five cases. (This and other figures show clearly the sharp fall in air temperature associated with rain.) Fig. 10. There were 15 cases between October and February. On March 6 to 8 there was a rainfall totalling 1 inch, accompanied by a sharp fall in temperature, between March 8 to 14, sixteen cases of strangles were admitted. On June 7 there was 0.3 inch rain, and three days later 10 cases of strangles were admitted. During the following monsoon, only one case appeared. Fig. 11. Cases first appeared on December 9, there being 14 cases in that month. In January and February there were 61 cases, of which 29 were admitted in one day, February 16. During December to February minimum temperatures were very low actually below freezing point from January 14 to 18, followed during the next fortnight by heavy rainfall. Between the following May 25 and June 24 there were 21 cases, and during this period the minimum temperature fell on several occasions by 14 to 16&deg; F. within a space of two or three days. A few cases only occurred during the following monsoon. Fig. 12. Five cases appeared in December and 18 cases within 11 days in January, after which only three cases developed during the rest of the year 1936. The January cases were apparently associated with minimum temperatures around freezing point. DISCUSSION It will be useful to refer to the position in respect of diseases of other animals and of man which are acquired by the respiratory tract. In Britain and the United States, diphtheria is reported to reach its greatest intensity in the late autumn and winter, scarlet fever in the late autumn, winter and spring. Acute rheumatism, which is probably streptococcal in origin, has its maximum in winter or spring and is lowest in summer in temperate countries. Green- wood and Thompson [1907] found evidence of a connection between prevalence and dry weather, but no significant correlation with mean air tempe- rature in any month. In Britain and the United States, influenza is highest but declining during the first half of the year, while measles is at its maxi- mum in March or April. Small-pox in India has received much attention from the meteorological point of view by Rogers [1926] and Russell and Sundararajan [1928-9]. In most areas this dis- ease has a tendency to greater prevalence during the first half of the year, ordinarily reaching its maximum before the rains and beginning to dimi- nish after their commencement, and the correla- tion coefficients are in fact negative and significant both with rainfall and relative humidity. Some of the largest small-pox epidemics occur in the low rainfall areas of North-West and Central India and of the Deccan plateau and are least severe in Bengal with its consistently high rainfall. In the dry areas mentioned, epidemics nearly always follow a greater or less failure of the south-west monsoon, accompanied by a comparatively low humidity. The explanation presumably is that the survival of the virus is favoured by dry air [Loosli et al, 1943]. It is well-known that the common cold and pneumonia are most frequent during the winter months, the meteorological factor directly or indirectly responsible for this in adults being the prevailing low temperature. In the case of pneumococcus pneumonia of man in India, Rogers [1925] has shown that its incidence is greater in the north-western part of the country, which has as its main climatic characteristics a great diurnal range of temperature (about 30&deg;F.), a low minimum (35&deg;F. or less) in the cold season and a low humidi- ty. From the seasonal point of view, pneumonia is most prevalent during the dry cold season (No- vember to February) and next during the dry-hot season (March to June). One cannot fail to note the similarity in this respect between pneumonia in man and strangles in horses. The case is said to be different with pulmonary tuberculosis in man, which Rogers [1925, 1] has shown is associated in Indian jails with high rainfall and high humidity and also with the direction, steadiness and strength of the rain-bearing winds. The disease is, there- fore, especially prevalent in Bengal and the coastal areas of Orissa, Madras and Bombay. In the case of animals, it may be noted that ' snuffles '92 Incidence of Equine Strangles in India January. In Sargodha there were no cases up to 14th February. Strangles started in Sargodha in the middle of February after a period of severe cold wet weather ; this is always the case, as it reduces natural resistance of the young stock..... Strangles is still going on in Sargodha and has been kept up, by successive batches of stock re- ceived up to the middle of May. Major F. J. Andrews, R.A.V.C., in a letter dated 8 February 1935 states ' As is usual during the winter months here (Sargodha), the heavy rain was followed by a number of cases of Strangles in nearly all paddocks of susceptible stock '*. Major W. E. Barry, R.A.V.C. in a report dated the 14 June 1938 states ' There were few deaths up to the end of April (at Sar- godha) ; up to this time the disease was not very severe, probably due to the favourable weather, the winter being mild with little rain '. During a visit to the Punjab in May 1943, I obtained the following information. Major M. F. Keightley, Remount Department (commanding at Mona) said that ' cases are most severe after the Christ- mas rains of December and January. The dis- ease tends to begin after a heavy downpour, followed by three or four cloudy days with cold wind'. At Sargodha, the veterinary officer and two risaldars gave independent evidence of similar nature and added that the warm dry weather coming at the end of March and in April tends to be followed by a decline in the number of cases. At both depots, the storms are local, sharp, and frequent from January on. Rain is also very localized at Coleyana and Renala, but the amount is rather less in winter than that at the depots. The problem of why diseases have a seasonal trend is undoubtedly complex. In the case of respiratory disease, two factors at least may be operative on the host, (a) extremes of air tempe- rature and humidity or sudden changes in these elements, and (b) a transient and perhaps seasonal defect in the mechanism of immunity It is common knowledge that a more or less sudden cooling of the body through exposure to low air temperature is liable to disturb the func- tion of the respiratory tract, especially when the effects of cold are accentuated by wetting of the body surface through rain and by the action of wind. In man, a similar result may be brought about during the hot dry season by chills induced by excessive radiation or evaporation ; cold in the head being by no means uncommon through this cause, when the shade temperature level is over 100&deg;F. Exposure to cold will not only initiate clinical attacks in the more susceptible animals but will also raise the general carrier rate. In consequence, the amount and diffusion of in- fective material are increased, so that fresh impe- tus is given to the outbreak and it may continue for some time, possibly in milder form, in spite of an improvement in the weather. Again, in connection with this first factor, Win- slow, Herrington and Nelbach [1942] have shown that substantial drying of the nose and throat occurs at air temperatures of say 70&deg; or 80&deg;F. if the relative humidities at these temperatures are less than 54 and 39 respectively. Boyd and Johns. ton [1940] have pointed out that a fine adjustment in the water content of the respiratory tract (trachea and lungs) is required to maintain this in health. They showed, in fact, with rats that the water content of the lungs tends to be remarkably constant. During the autumn, however, when the animals were exposed to the first cold spell, there was a significant increase in water content, and this was followed by an equally significant drying of the tract when the hot-water system in their living rooms was turned on. Further, Cralley [1942] has shown in experiments on rabbits that, when the animals are made to inhale very large numbers of bacteria through the medium of drop- let nuclei, only a very small percentage reaches the lungs. Under ' normal ' conditions (air tempera- ture 26&deg;C. and relative humidity 45 per cent), 80 per cent of the organisms that do reach the lungs are removed within the first hour and over 90 per cent within three hours. When the animals are first subjected to extremes of temperature and humidity (38&deg;C. and 30 per cent humidity, 4&deg;C. and 80 per cent humidity) or first to one extreme and then to another, the rate of removal is tem- porarily but definitely depressed. As to the second factor, there is reason to sup- pose that the animal body undergoes an important modification in susceptibility, which may be sea- sonal. Wilson [1930] has shown that in mice there occur transient fluctuations in their resist- ance to Bact. aertrycke. These variations in re- sistance, however, were not definitely seasonal and the author applies the term 'fluctuating immunity' to those ' variations in resistance which occur from time to time and which are due to alterations in the physiological behaviour of the animal dependent on changing environmental conditions '. The nature of the change in question has excited the attention of investigators and is but vaguely understood. It may have an external origin, e.g., it may be dietetic and concerned with the lack of fresh green fodder at cer- tain seasons. Webster & Burn (loc. cit.), for instance, noted a higher proportion of Pasteurella carriers among rabbits on an ' incomplete' diet than in ones on a ' complete ' diet. As is the case with ' chills ', there would result a larger amount of infective material available to the population * The italics are introduced by me, because this state- ment points to some uniformly acting cause
F. C. MINETT 93 On the other hand, the change may be intrinsic in origin and connected with seasonal modifica- tions in endocrinal activity. Apart from the two factors named above, a dry hot atmosphere will promote dust formation, es- pecially when there is some movement of the air, and this by irritating the mucous membranes may assist the penetration of infective material. Rain- fall and moist atmospheric conditions will have an opposite effect. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that, contrary to what is sometimes imagined, haemolytic streptococci are not delicate organisms. Thus, it has been shown that they can survive in dust for weeks and are often abundant in the air of rooms that have been occupied by human beings suffering from streptococcus disease [White, 1936 ; Brown and Allison, 1937]. By way of comment on these predisposing caus- es, it may be said that some drying effect on the respiratory tract of young horses may occur at certain seasons, e.g., in May and June at Mont- gomery, and this adverse effect may be enhanced by an excess of dust in the atmosphere. This, however, is little more than a guess, and the data at hand scarcely permit a serious consideration of the possibility. Again, as to whether there is any transient variation in the animals' resistance, little can be said. If there is, it can hardly be due, in this case, to lack of green food. Of the causes mentioned, the influence of chilling must be regarded as of preponderating importance, especially in young animals, and the evidence produced in this paper supports the statements of observers on the spot. The lack of adequate shelter under winter conditions in the Punjab must put a severe strain on the animal's heat regulation, and it is strongly felt that insufficient attention has been paid to means for remedying this. (The photographs accompanying my previous paper are believed to provide evidence of this.) The Climatological Atlas of India shows that the ab- solute minimum temperature in December and January (the coldest months) is around 28&deg;F. at Khushab (Shahpur District), slightly higher at Montgomery but still very low viz., 30&deg;F., while at Ahmednagar it is 40&deg; to 45&deg;F. Mean minimum temperatures for these months are about 40&deg; to 41&deg;F. at Khushab, 42.5&deg; F. at Montgomery and 53&deg;F. at Ahmednagar (see also Table I). It has been pointed out above that the winter storms of the Punjab and the northerly breeze at this season in the north-west of the province will reinforce the action of cold, but that the more southerly breezes at the time of the summer rains are unlikely to have much damaging affect. It seems likely also that the reason why donkeys usually escape the disease is simply because they have much heavier coats, and not because they are inherently more resistant. Objections to shelters have been raised on the score of cost but all that is really needed are cheap constructions. In the day time, simple mud-brick walls would suffice to keep off driving wind and rain or a mud-wall enclosure might be provided in each paddock as refuge both by day and night in bad weather. The planting of trees as wind-breaks may also be recommended. It may thus be said that there seem to be two important factors involved in the epizootiology of strangles, (a) the cold and rain of the Punjab winter, which, perhaps by increasing a normally elevated carrier rate at this season, is largely instrumental in initiating outbreaks and thereby augmenting the dosage of infective matter in the locality; (b) at the depots the introduction of fresh susceptible young stock at a particularly dangerous time, viz. late in the purchasing season. As Allen [1923] says, ' It is impossible to control strangles if............young stock are received as late as April or May when strangles is usually at its height'. This second factor, however, may be misleading and cause one to overlook the point that the initial stimulus has been unfavour- able weather conditions. The relative importance of these two factors will no doubt vary to some extent in different years, and it is unnecessary to hold rigid views. But it is difficult to escape the conclusion that, from the meteorological point of view, the remount depots and horse-breeding farms of the Punjab are unhappily situated. SUMMARY Equine strangles, as studied in India, is chiefly a disease of the colder months. In this respect it resembles certain respiratory diseases of man, e.g. scarlet fever, colds, and pneumonia. Thus, it has been shown that in the Punjab the attack rate is significantly higher in the cold season than in the hot and is significantly lower in the summer rainy season. At Ahmednagar (Bombay), where the climate is more equable than in the Punjab, the attack rate also rises significantly during the drier and cooler months and falls during the warmer wet months from April to October. Further support to the general conclusion is derived from an examination of local meteorologi- cal data which in the Punjab show some degree of association between low absolute minimum tem- peratures and the onset of outbreaks. The association between weather conditions and strangles is studied to best advantage at the farms where the stock are reared ; at the depots, condi- tions are somewhat artificial and the observations are confused by the fact that the numbers of susceptible stock are mounting fairly rapidly throughout the winter, while by May outbreaks tend to terminate abruptly owing to the shortage of susceptibles. In general, the observations are complicated by the facts that, while outbreaks tend to develop in the cold weather, they may continue

On the Punjab farms, it is also to be noted that (1) a secondary rise in the attack rate may occur in May-June when for days on end there is a very hot dry wind with liability to dust storms, and (2) following several seasons of low incidence and re- sulting increase in the local susceptibility, out- breaks sometimes commence during the hot season. In the endeavour to control strangles in the Punjab, insufficient attention has been paid to the necessity of protecting young horses from the effects of extreme cold and winter rain.

(iv) Effect of using different sugars In the Baudouin test a 1 per cent solution of cane sugar in HCl is employed. Villavecchia replaced cane sugar by furfurol.

All the above named sugars did not give any blank. With fructose, invert sugar and cane sugar, the readings were much higher when compared to furfurol standard, the intensity increasing in the order mentioned. It was also interesting to note that, in case of the three last named sugars, the raising of the reaction temperature did not produce very marked intensity in colour. Further, fructose, invert sugar and cane sugar gave high blanks as indicated below: Fructose Invert sugar Sucrose R. 4.3 30 2.3 Y. 19.9 10.2 8.0 As there was a considerable proportion of yellow colour, the quantitative reading suffered. Again, with these three sugars, the reading did not remain constant, but the colour rapidly changed from red to dark brown. For all these reasons, it was felt that the replacement of any sugar for furfurol was not of any great benefit under practical condition. To minimize this defect when different sugars are used, instead of using pure HCl, acid con- taining 0.5 per cent and 1.0 per cent stannous chloride (Soltsein Reagent) was employed. The results are given in Table VII.

Thus even under these modifications the furfurol reagent was to be preferred. CONCLUSIONS (1) The intensity of colour developed in the Villavecchia reaction increased with increase in the strength of HCl. Fuming HCl gave the best results. (2) The colour developed in the Villavecchia reaction increased with the quantity of sesame oil present in the reaction mixture, but it was not exactly proportional to the quantity of oil used. (3) The sensitivity of the reaction could be greatly enhanced by heating the test mixture for three minutes at 50&deg;C before centrifuging. Higher temperatures did not produce uniform results. (4) Substitution of furfurol by any of the following sugars, viz. lactose, invert sugar, manose, galactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose and dextrin, did not increase the sensitivity of the reaction. (5) Improved Villavecchia reaction was carried out as follows: 10 gm. of oil were mixed with 0.1 ml. of 2 per cent alcoholic solutions of furfurol and 10 ml. of HCl. After shaking, the tubes were kept in a water-bath at 50&deg;C. for three minutes, shaken and the aqueous layer allowed to sepa- rate. For the quantitative estimation of colour, the aqueous layer was transferred to centrifuge tubes and then centrifuged at 2,500 r.p.m. for five minutes.

DAVE, Animal Nutrition and Dairy Chemistry Section, Institute of Agriculture, Anand (Received for publication on 23 August 1943) THE results of a series of experiments hitherto carried out to study the effects of various food fats on the quantity and quality of milk fat suggest that the quantitative secretion of milk fat can be altered by a dietary fat, but not over any extended period, whereas the physical and chemical cons- tants of milk fat can be permanently modified by the quality of the fat ingested. These observa- tions have, however, been made on the milk fat from cows only. There is an apparent lack of in- formation as to the extent the milk fat of buffaloes is susceptible to both quantitative and qualitative changes due to the character of the foodfat con- sumed. Only a few recorded data are available which would indicate the comparative influence of the dietary fat on the milk fats of cows and buffaloes when both these species are fed the same production ration [Doctor et al, 1940] or when their production ration is similarly altered by a dietary modification. In the present paper are reported the results of an investigation carried out to study : (a) The comparative difference in the physical and chemical constants of ghee, produced from the milk fats of both cows and buffaloes, when they were receiving the same production ration, and (b) The relative changes in the physical and chemical constants of ghee, when the concentrate mixture in the production ration was entirely replaced by cotton seed. Cotton seed is one of the most commonly used concentrates for milch cattle in Bombay Province and the Western Indian States. There is a popu- lar belief in these parts that cows and buffaloes, when fed on cotton seed, give milk richer in fat, and the ghee made from the butter fat of such animals is of superior quality. EXPERIMENTAL For the purpose of the investigation 12 healthy animals, six Kankrej cows and six Surti buffaloes, were selected. The selected animals were appro- ximately similar in age, number and the stage of lactation. They were divided into two groups, ' experimental' and 'control'. In the experimental group were taken four cows and four buffaloes, and in the control group, two cows and two buffaloes. The rations for the two groups of animals are set out in Table I.

D. PATEL, B. M. PATEL AND C, N. DAVE 99 Cow ghee vs. buffalo ghee. The data in Table II offer a clear picture of the impression made by an identical diet on the milk fat of cows and buffaloes. It may be seen that, under both experimental and control feeding, the B.R., P. and Acid values are significantly higher, and such constants as Sap. value, R.M. value and K. value are significantly lower in the ghee from the milk fat of cows than that of buffaloes. These results are in agreement with the findings of Doctor et al. [1940] who have determined the physical and chemical constants of ghee from different breeds of cows as well as from Murrah buffaloes, kept under similar conditions of feeding and management. These results thus lead to the conclusion that even under identical dietary and management there is a distinct species difference in the character of the milk fat secreted by the cow and the buffalo. The B.R. and Sap. values suggest that in the milk fat of the buffalo the proportion of the fatty acids of higher mole- cular weight is less than that in the milk fat of the cow. This is also supported by the higher R.M. value. The higher K. value of buffalo ghee shows that the milk fat of this species is richer in butyric acid, but its proportion of water insoluble volatile acids is comparatively lower than that of the milk fat of the cow as is evident from the P. value deter- mined. The free fatty acid content is higher in the milk fat of the cow than that of the buffalo. The effect of heavy feeding of cotton seed. The effect of the replacement of the concentrate mixture in the production ration entirely by cotton seed on the constants of ghee from cows and buffaloes is shown in Table III.

The replacement of the concentrate mixture in the production ration entirely by cotton seed shows that in the ghee from both the cow and the buffalo the B.R. value increases, but all other constants show a decrease. The qualitative change brought about in ghee by cotton seed feeding is more pro- nounced in buffalo ghee than in cow ghee. The limits of variations in the constants of ghee from cows and buffaloes under the present condi- tions of study have been discussed, along with the data of other workers.

KRISHNA IYER, Research Officer, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 19 January 1944) (With Plate X) TUBERCULOSIS in buffaloes is mentioned by several authors. Kutchukoff [1909] noted the frequent occurrence of the disease in draught buffaloes in the Balkans, Turkey and some parts of Asia. Tuberculosis is stated to be. more common in the male than in the female. He adds that the disease is rare in milch buffaloes even when housed for years in the same byre as tubercu- lous cows. He tuberculin-tested 20 milch buffaloes and 24 milch cows stalled together and found that 40 per cent of the cows and only one milch buffalo reacted. He observed that tuberculin gave a strong reaction in posi- tive cases in the buffalo. Mitter [1910] reports a case of tuberculosis in a buffalo in Calcutta, with lesions present only in the lungs. Eber [1917] refers to buffaloes in the abattoir at Budapest as being affected with tuberculosis to the extent of only 0.18 per cent. Piot Bey [1917] observed that in the abattoir at Alexand- ria, tuberculosis was not seen in young buffalo calves, but only in animals three to five years old. About 60 per cent of old animals, parti- cularly females, were affected, and 1 to 2 per cent of these showed large and multiple tuber- culous lesions. In the abattoir at Cairo, tuber- culosis is frequently seen in young buffaloes and 7 per cent of all buffaloes slaughtered are found affected, mainly with lesions in the thorax and uncommonly in the abdominal organs. Tuberculous lesions in the buffalo are said to resemble those usually met with in cattle, and some portions of the glands have been found calcified. Soparkar [1925] tested the susceptibility of different breeds of Indian cattle and buffaloes to bovine tuberculosis and found that buffaloes were apparently more sus- ceptible than cattle. By subcutaneous inocula- tion of 50 mg. virulent bovine culture in five to six-month-old calves and 14-month-old buffalo- calves he obtained a greater death rate in bu- ffalo-calves. The same writer [1926] observed a case of tuberculosis in a male-buffalo at Mukteswar in India. This animal reacted strongly to the double-intradermal tuberculin test and on post-mortem advanced caseating tuberculosis lesions were found in the medias- tinal and bronchial glands. Soparkar and Dhillon [1931] examined 1,116 animals (cows, bullocks and buffaloes) in the slaughter house at Lahore and found 255 animals, i.e. 22.05 per cent, infected with tuberculosis. The inci- dence of tuberculosis in cows, bullocks and buffaloes was 21.3 per cent, 31.6 per cent and 23.6 per cent respectively. Naik [1932] des- cribed a case of tuberculosis in a female Jafferabadi buffalo. The animal was in poor condition, and had loose bowels, a short husky cough, impaired appetite, pale mucous mem- branes and accelerated respiration. On post- mortem there was extreme emaciation, and tuberculous lesions were present in both lungs, and the mediastinal, bronchial, submaxillary, posterior mammary and mesenteric glands, as well as in the liver. Carpano [1934] considers that in Egypt tuberculosis is more prevalent
P. R. KRISHNA IYER 101 among buffaloes than is generally believed, especially in lower Egypt where buffaloes are housed under unsatisfactory condition. His data on incidence are limited to information obtained from public abattoirs. Statistics collected at the abattoir at Alexandria on animals from lower Egypt showed that about 60 per cent of aged buffaloes and 9 per cent of the calves slaughtered were affected with tuberculosis, especially the pulmonary form. In the abattoir at Cairo the incidence was considerably less and this is attributed to the fact that most of the animals slaughtered came from upper Egypt or the Sudan where housing coditions are reason- ably good. Carpano tested 350 apparently healthy buffaloes (348 female and 2 male) by the intradermal and subcutaneous methods; 51 reacted to the intradermal test: of these 11 gave positive reactions when subsequently tested by the subcutaneous method and had tuberculous lesions on post-mortem examination. Carpano noted that tuberculin, both in buffaloes and cattle, produced a similar type of reaction, except that the subcutaneous injection of tuber- culin in buffaloes was often followed by a local reaction and the maximum temperature was not reached until 30 hours after injection, sometimes the local reaction is so severe as to cause lameness and inappetence, and transitory decrease in milk yield. It is concluded that buffaloes are more sensitive to tuberculin than cattle and the subcutaneous test is recommend- ed in the field owing to the possibility of non- specific reactions after intradermal injection. Bubbermann [1934], in Java, reports that a skin disease of buffaloes characterized by the presence of 'tubercles' was examined by cultural and animal inoculation tests for tuberculosis but with negative results. He also refers to an atypical strain of the tubercle bacillus isolated from a buffalo. Topacio [1935] states that clinical tuberculosis has not been recorded in buffaloes in the Philippines, but that they readily die of tuberculosis after experimental inocula- tion. Bunanos [1936], in Greece, states that buffaloes are considered less susceptible to tuberculosis than cattle. Lobel, Van der Schaaf and Roza [1936] isolated three strains of tubercle bacilli from the water-buffalo and found them to be of bovine type. These strains had a low virulence for small laboratory animals and gave a week initial growth on media. The report of a Committee on Diseases of the Philip- pine Veterinary Medical Association [1937] states that three cases of buffalo tuberculosis were diagnosed by microscopical and bacterio- logical methods. One of these was shown by animal and cultural tests to be due to the bovine type of bacillus. Topacio and Coronel [1941] demonstrated that the native Carabao (domestic buffalo) of the Philippines is experi- mentally susceptible to tuberculosis and that a healthy carabao placed in contact with an arti- ficially infected carabao contracted the disease. They add that the carabao is susceptible to natural infection under ranch conditions and that fatal termination occurred when the ani- mal's resistance is lowered by an inter-current disease such as surra. Hadwen [1942] reports an outbreak of tuberculosis in a large herd of buffaloes in the National Buffalo Park at Wain- wright (U.S.A.). In 1907 the herd consisted of 742 buffaloes. From 1914 to 1923, there was no outward indication of tuberculosis in the herd, but in 1923, it was decided to destroy some of the animals. In the first three kills (1923-29) the oldest animals in the herd were slaughtered, and the percentage of tuberculous affection was the highest in these 3 kills, viz., about 72 to 77 per cent animals. In the final slaughter in 1939, there was a marked drop in the percentage with tuberculous lesions, viz. 30.14 per cent: in this kill animals of all ages including calves were slaughtered. Among animals slaughtered in 1923, several cases of generalized tuberculosis were noted. This work- er observes that the incidence of tuberculosis did not prevent the herd increasing in size. The writer encountered a case of tuberculosis in a she-buffalo in Lahore. The animal, al- though in excellent bodily condition, showed a high temperature, dyspnoea, an occasional cough, a jugular pulse and oedema of the dewlap. The owner stated that the buffalo was a heavy milker and that she suddenly went dry about two days before admission to the hospital. The case was diagnosed as traumatic pericarditis with pneumonia as a complication; death occurred on the 3rd day. Post-mortem examina- tion showed extensive bilateral pulmonary lesions with tuberculous pneumonia of the an- terior lobes. The lesions varied in size from a pea to a tennis ball. The contents of the larger tubercles were dissipated, with cavitation, (Plate X figs. 1 and 2). The mediastinal and bronchial glands were enlarged and extensively caseated. No other part of the body was found affected. This case indicates that the bodily condition may at times be so well maintained that disease may not be suspected, though it may be advanced. Data concerning the types of tubercle bacilli isolated from the buffalo are extremely meagre, and this investigation on abattoir material was,
102 Tuberculosis in Buffaloes therefore, undertaken to provide such data. Since the data obtained from one province alone might not be applicable to the whole of India, the investigation was centred at three widely separated places, viz., Izatnagar (U. P.), Bombay City and Calcutta and included the examination of buffaloes from both rural and urban areas. In all, 500 buffaloes were examined, viz., 250 at Izatnagar in 1940, 120 at Kurla in Bombay City in 1941, and 130 buffaloes at Calcutta in 1942. The animals pre- sented for slaughter at these places had no doubt been brought up under different living conditions and were thus to some extent repre- sentative of both town and village animals. TECHNIQUE Material from an abattoir near Izatnagar was brought to the laboratory and examined by culture and animal inoculation; at Bombay and Culcutta material was straightaway inocula- ted into guineapigs which were subsequently examined at the Institute. Since primary cul- tures from tuberculous lesions were not obtain- ed on Dorset egg medium in the first attempts at Izatnagar, the original material was in all further cases inoculated into guineapigs from which cultures on Dorset egg were successfully raised. INCIDENCE OF INFECTION At Izatnagar abattoir, about 30 to 40 buffaloes are slaughtered daily, the animals being brought from villages within a 50 mile radius. Buffaloes of both sexes, usually 6-10 years, are slaughter- ed and are mostly in good condition. The post- mortem examination was necessarily confined to the lungs and to the thoracic, pharyngeal, sub- maxillary and mesenteric glands. In Bombay, about 20 female buffaloes are slaughtered daily. These animals are in good condition and are disposed of by city dairies when dry or nearly so. The unfavourable condi- tions of maintenance render them more liable to tuberculosis. In Calcutta the buffaloes slaughtered are in fairly good condition and they are probably of mixed rural and urban origin. The incidence of the disease among the animals examined was as follows: Number Tuberculous Percentage Izatnagar . . . 250 6 2.4 Kurla . . . 120 16 13.3 Calcutta . . . 130 3 2.3 In stall-fed buffaloes of Bombay City, the inci- dence was high compared with that of pasture- fed animals bred in the rural districts around Izatnagar. This percentage does not, perhaps, represent the average incidence of tuberculosis in buffaloes in India, as many of these animals may have been sent for slaughter because they were obviously diseased, and disposal by slaughter proved a convenient means of removal.

The only record in this country of infection arising by any other route is that of Naik where infection was
P. R KRISHNA IYER 103 presumably by the alimentary route. Most of the diseased animals were in fairly good condi- tion, and in some the condition was excellent. Calcification of the lesions (15 out of 25 cases) was not uncommon. Of the six cases at Izat- nagar, three alone yielded tubercle bacilli in culture. Whilst 16 cases were detected at Bombay and confirmed microscopically, mate- rial from only eight cases was inoculated into guineapigs. Of the three cases in Calcutta the organism was recovered from two: thus 13 strains were available for typing. TYPING OF TUBERCLE BACILLI FROM BUFFALOES Cultural. Tubes of plain egg (Dorset medium) inoculated from the precural and sub- lumbar glands and spleen of affected guinea pigs were incubated at 37&deg;C. Growth appeared after five weeks or in some cases after nine weeks. The average number of days for appear- ance of growth in primary culture was 53 days. The second and third generation cultures grew more quickly but growth was not prolific. Cul- turally, the buffalo tubercle strains appeared to be typically dysgonic and were nearly always restrained by added glycerin, with one excep- tion (strain 7), which grew equally in plain and in glycerinated egg media. Animal inoculation. Guinea-pig inoculation with organ-suspension from the primary lesion appeared to indicate that the virulence of the organism was lower than that usual for bovine types, since in some cases five months elapsed before death. Experiments with the second and third generation cultures indicated, however, that the virulence was of standard type.

H. S. BAWA 105 It will be seen from the Table II that: After 1.0 mg. S/c. guinea pigs survived for 89/71 days, mean 51 days. After 0.1 mg. S/c guinea pigs survived for 32 91 days, mean 57 days. After 0.1 mg. I/v rabbits survived for 21-52 days, mean 31 days. After 0.01 mg. rabbits survived for 22-56 days, mean 87 days. After 5.0 mg. S/c rabbits survived for 50-125 32-81 days, mean 57 days. Fowls inoculated intravenously with 0.1 and 0.01 mg. of culture showed no evidence of tuberculosis when examined six months later. Thus, the results of pathogenicity, and cul- tural tests indicate that all these 13 strains are of bovine type and that second and third genera- tion cultures of standard virulence. SUMMARY The available literature on tuberculosis in buffaloes is reviewed. Examination of 500 buffaloes slaughtered in three abattoirs in the United Provinces, Bombay and Bengal yielded 25 cases of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 13 of these. Cultural and biological studies showed them to be of the bovine type and the virulence was standard only after the strains had been cultured. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My thanks are due to Dr. F. C.

Indust. 2, 181-191 106 'Wah' of Goats and Sheep in Sind the primary local lesion is generally in the udder, which becomes hot, swollen and painful, while the milk becomes either thick or thin and watery, occasionally blood-tinged with fibrin clots and is greatly reduced in quantity. A painful swelling of the knee and hock joints appears three or four days after the udder complications, giving rise to acute lameness. The swelling of the udder subsides within seven to ten days and is followed by an atrophy of the gland. The milk secretion does not return to normal. The few drops which can be squeezed out with great difficulty are greatly altered in consistency and appearance, having become either thick or watery and flocculent. In about three months the swelling of the joints decreases and the lameness dis- appears ; the mammary gland becomes soft and on palpation may be found to contain indurated areas. Usually only one quarter of the udder is involved. When the whole udder is involved, there is no secretion of milk in the affected quarters on the next kidding, with the result that the young ones die of starvation. Lambs and kids may be infected in utero and show swelling of the hock, knee or fetlock joints at birth and are unable to stand (Plate XI). The majority of them die after a few days. Sometimes the disease affects the mammary glands only. In one outbreak 5 per cent of the affected goats and sheep had inflammatory eye lesions, viz., conjunctivitis, corneal opacity and the presence of highly-injected minute blood vessels in the sclera, immediately around the cornea. In this particular outbreak 20 per cent of the animals showed obvious lachrymation. The lactating animals are the most susceptible, but males and the non-lactating animals may also be affected. Young animals are less susceptible than adults. It has been observed that abortion is quite common among goats suffering from Wah, the percentage of abortion varying from 5 to 20 per cent. It may be mentioned here that generally the disease is seen in goats only, while sheep in the same area, though grazing and living with affected goats, seem to remain free. Only one outbreak has been recorded in which both goats and sheep were seen to be affected. In the experimental animals the symptoms observed were the same as those noticed in natural cases. Under natural and experimental conditions only a certain per- centage of animals contract the disease. MORBID ANATOMY Autopsy on ten. natural cases of the disease and three experimental goats revealed that the main changes were confined to the knee and mammary glands. The postmortem findings are summarized below in detail : Knee joints. The swollen joints were painful- and soft on pressure, and contained an excess of fluid. The bursae were thickened and there was fibrositis. Mammary gland. The gland was atrophied and soft and had indurated areas. In acute cases the gland was inflammed and showed areas of necrosis, The mammary lymphatic glands were also enlarged in acute cases. In some cases the liver appeared to be enlarged ; sometimes there was infestation with liver-flukes, while at other times no parasite could be found. Other organs were normal, except that the stomach and intestines showed a varying degree of helminthic infestation, among which amphis- tomes, Haemonchus contortus, and Trichuris ovis were predominant. HISTOPATHOLOGY Knee joints. There was peri-arthritis, with proliferation of fibrous tissue. In some cases only bursitis and superficial fibrositis were seen. Udder. Inflammatory changes with multiple abscesses were noticed in experimental animals, which had been given infective material through the teat canal. These changes were also noticed in some natural cases. In some cases, advanced hyperplasia of the fibrous tissue with monocytic infiltration round the acini was seen, and in others slight monocytic infiltration round the acini and very slight fibrosis were noticed. Liver. Biliary and portal cirrhosis, extensive haemorrhagic areas (haemorrhagic infarcts) and verminous nodules, eosinophile infiltration, asso- ciated with necrotic changes were observed. No helminth parasites could be detected in sections. BACTERIOLOGY Examinations of smears of blood, milk and films from the cut surface of the mammary gland and from knee joint fluid repeatedly proved negative for pathogenic micro-organisms and protozooa. In most cases the cultural examination of different organs, viz., liver, spleen, kidney, mammary gland, knee joint, milk and urine failed to reveal any pathogenic organisms. In one case coliform organisms were isolated from the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart-blood and knee-joints, but they were of no pathogenic significance, as both the young and old were seen to be affected alike and there was nothing to suggest navel-ill or joint-ill. In one instance staphylococci were isolated from the joint fluid. These presumably were contaminants, as no sign of pus or abscess formation has ever been seen in the knee joints. Milk, blood and urine from affected animals were culturally examined for Brucella abortus
H. S. BAWA 107 and Brucella melitensis with negative results. Numerous samples of blood sera were examined and found to be negative on agglutination test for Brucella infection. TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS These experiments were conducted with a view to finding out the infectious nature of the disease. For these experiments, naturally affected goats were brought to Karachi in order to have a fresh supply of material at hand. Experiment No. 1 Four healthy goats were used, and the material was obtained from the donor goat, No. DI, brought from Jamesabad. TABLE I Material obtained from donor goat No. D1 Expt. goat No. Date Route Material Dose Remarks 1 27-4-39 Intrav. Blood 5 c.c.

Experiment No. 2 Since in experiment No. 1 intravenous inocula- tion of blood in goat No. 1 showed some reac- tion, it was decided to repeat blood inoculation. Three healthy goats were used for this experiment. No definite conclusions could be drawn from the experiments (Table II), as the animals did not develop the disease while under observation for two months and a half.

Same as above, except that goat did not abort. 7 Do. Subcut. Do. 10 c.c. On 2nd day of inoculation temp. rose to 105.8&deg;F. due to abscess formation. Abs- cess burst on 4th day, and temp. then returned to normal. Experiment No. 3 This experiment was designed to explore the possibility of milk being the carrier of an infective agent ; also to see if the teat canal would serve as the route of infection, since milk given subcutane- ously and orally to goat No. 2 in Experiment No. 1 failed to produce the disease. The goats used for this experiment, and experiments to follow were in lactation. Preparation of inocula. Milk in all the experi- ments when given viá the teat canal was diluted with boiled distilled water, in ratio of 3 : 1, after the milk had been filtered through sterilized gauze to free it from blood and fibrin clots.

Acute changes seen in left teat. Rt. teat remained normal. Changes in milk in both the udders resembled those seen natural cases. Died on 23rd April 1943 Thus a disease confined to the udder was pro- duced in goat No. 8 (Table III). Experiment No. 4 This experiment was designed to see if milk from exptl. goat No. 8 was infective. One healthy goat No. 9 was injected via the teat canal, the left and right teat canals receiving respectively 20 c.c. and 10 c.c. of milk from the left and right side of the udder of goat No. 8. Acute changes were seen in the left side of the udder, and the milk was greatly reduced in quantity. Eight days after the inoculation, acute lameness and swelling of the right knee joint were observed such as are seen in natural cases. Thus the disease was successfully passaged from one experimental animal to another, and typical symptoms of the disease were produced. Experiment No. 5 One healthy goat No. 10 was housed and fed with donor goat No. D3 received from Jamesabad (from the 4th April to 23rd May 1942 when donor goat died) in order to see if the disease could be conveyed by contact. The receptor, however, showed no inflammatory lesions of the udder or joints, and the temperature remained normal. The animal, however, showed changes in the milk and udder, became emaciated, and died on the 11th June 1942. Thus the disease appears to be transmissible by contact, when the diseased and healthy goats are housed and fed together. Experiment No. 6 Experiments No. 3 and 4 proved that the infec- tive agent is present in the milk and that the disease could be conveyed via the teat canal. This experiment was designed to see if the disease could be produced in healthy lactating animals by injecting milk subcutaneously or intra muscu- larly. Inocula consisted of three collective samples of mammary exudate taken from three batches of four, three and three goats suffering from Wah received from Laso Mahomed village, Khipro and Mirpurkhas on 23rd October 1942, 22nd October 1942 and 1st February 1943, respectively.

H. S. BAWA 109 The results of experiment No. 6 (Table IV) show- ed that the disease could be produced in susceptible animals by subcutaneous and intra muscular inoculation of milk from affected cases. Experiment No. 7 This experiment was designed to see if the infective agent, which is believed to be a filterable virus, present in the milk, can be destroyed by heat at 60° C. for half-an-hour, as most known viruses are destroyed at temperatures ranging between 58°C. and 60°C. This experiment also served to show whether infection could be conveyed from the experimentally-produced disease to a second healthy goat.

No reaction This experiment (Table V) shows that the disease can be passaged, and that the causative agent is destroyed when heated to 60°C. for half an hour. DISCUSSION According to the 1939-40 Annual Report of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Wah was believed by early workers to be rinderpest, anthrax or haemorrhagic septicaemia. The present experimental and field investigation shows that Wah is none of the above-named diseases. As already indicated, no growth has been obtained by sowing samples of morbid material on laboratory media, and no pathogenic organisms could be seen on microscopical examination of milk, blood or knee joint fluid. It seems that the causative agent will probably prove to be a filter- able virus. (Attempts at isolating a virus could not be made in the author's laboratory owing to lack of facilities). The chief symptoms of the disease, viz, abor- tion, swelling of the joints, lameness, disturbances of milk secretion and keratitis are also seen in goats and sheep suffering from Brucella infections [Dobois, 1926]. An examination of urine, milk, blood and blood sera from the affected cases, however, indicated that Wah is not due to Brucella infection, while the absence of undulant fever in human beings consuming the milk from affected goats further supports this conclusion. The symptoms of the disease, as seen in natural cases and as shown by experimental animals, resemble contagious agalactia of sheep and goats [Wooldridge, 1923 ; Galloway, 1930]. The writer has been able to reproduce the disease in healthy animals by inoculation of altered milk, which is in conformity with the findings of Celli and De Blasi [1896]. After the introduction of virulent material, viz. mammary exudate, into the mammary gland, the milk was altered after three or four days ; in some cases the infection remained localized, in others after 10 to 12 days there was generalization to the knee joints. This finding is in agreement with that of Galloway [1930], the only difference being that no eye lesions were shown in the writer's experimental animals. The infective agent, after heating to 60°C. for half-an-hour, failed to produce the disease in healthy susceptible animals. These results are also comparable with those of Galloway [1930]. The above evidence tends to show that Wah of goats and sheep, as found in Sind, bears a strong resemblance to contagious agalactia of sheep and goats as found in Italy [Metaxa, 1816] and Algeria [Sergent & Roig, 1917]. In the Encyclope- dia of Wooldridge [1923] it is stated that the disease is limited to Europe, particularly the mountainous districts of Switzerland, Northern Italy and Southern France. This is the first record of the disease in India. As to treatment, no specific curative agent has been found for this condition. Bridre, Donation and Hilbert, [1928] in a small number of experi- ments obtained good results with stovarsol. This drug has not been tried by the writer owing to its present high price. Palliative treatment by oral administration of magnesium sulphate and salicylic acid has given apparently beneficial results. The intravenous injection of Lugol's solution and formalin has also been tried on a few animals with varying success.
110 A case of Tuberculosis in a Sheep SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. The disease of goats and sheep known as 'wah' occurs as a specific epizootic in Sind and is transmissible experimentally. 2. The disease bears a strong resemblance to the condition known as 'contagious agalactia' and this is the first record of its occurrence in India. 3. The symptoms, course and pathology of the disease are described. 4. The pathogenic agent appears to be a filterable virus, since the disease is infectious and no specific pathogenic organism could be isolated from the lesions. 5. The causative agent is destroyed by heat at 60&deg;C. for half-an-hour. 6. The incubation period in experimental goats is 5 to 11 days. 7. Inoculation of mammary exudate intra- muscularly or by the teat-canal set up a disease similar to that seen in natural outbreaks. 8. A healthy goat subjected to close contact with a natural case developed the chronic form of the disease confined to the udder. 9. Lactating animals appear to be more susceptible.

NANDA, M.R.C.V.S., Superintendent and KARNAIL SINGH, L.V.P., Government Cattle Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 28 August 1943) THE incidence of tuberculosis in sheep is extremely low. Although rare cases have been recorded in a number of other countries, the present one appears to be the first case recorded in India. SUBJECT A female lamb No. 503 (Lohi breed) 15 months old. HISTORY None. The carcase was received for post- mortem examination in the Farm Veterinary Hospital. POST-MORTEM FINDINGS Nothing unusual was noticed from the external appearance of the carcase. On opening it pathological changes were noticed in the thoracic cavity. Both the lungs were adherent to the thoracic wall and the pleuræ at these places were thickened. The surface of the lungs showed greyish white patches varying in size from a pinhead to a walnut and giving them a mottled appearance. Still bigger patches of irregular shape were seen as a result of coalescence of the smaller ones. The patches were level with the lung surface and did not show any elevation. The lung tissue on removal was found to be firm, enlarged and hepatized. On section through the patches, caseation with calcification was noticed. The substance of both the lungs was extensively involved and very little tissue was left unaffected. There was no evidence of any cavity formation. The associated lymph glands were enlarged and indurated. On cutting through" these glands, caseation and calcification was found. Nothing abnormal was found in the other organs. LABORATORY FINDINGS Smears from the lungs and affected lymph glands were prepared and stained by the Ziehl-Neilsen method. On examination under the microscope, acid fast organisms indistin- guishable from tubercle bacilli were detected. Material was sent to the Research Officer, Tuberculosis and Johne's Disease, Imperial
S. N. SAPRE 111 Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, who reported: "The diagnosis of tuberculosis was confirmed and the strain of tubercle bacillus isolated proved to be of the bovine type". A high incidence of tuberculosis was noticed in cattle on this Farm in 1939-40, though, at present, it has been considerably reduced by judicious management and suitable preventive measures. It is highly probable that this sheep contracted infection from the bovine stock on the farm, particularly as the bovine strain of tubercle bacillus was responsible for the disease. SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE LIFE-HISTORY OF THE DOG TICK RHIPICEPHALUS SANGUINEUS (LATREILLE) AT MUKTESWAR* By S. N. SAPRE, B.Sc., G.B.V.C., Research Scholar, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 1 December 1943) THE greater part of the material used in this work was received from Bombay and Baroda. The observations were made at Mukteswar (alt. 7,500 ft.). R. Sanguineus does not appear to adapt it- self as readily as Boophilus australis to the at- mospheric conditions existing at Mukteswar, and specimens of this species could only be collected in very small numbers from local dogs. Christophers [1907] made an extensive study on the life-history of R. sanguineus under Indian conditions but this was incidental to his work on the life-cycle of Babesia canis in this species of tick. It is evidently on this account that his records are not complete and do not indicate the temperature at which the specimens were reared. Nuttall [1914], at Cambridge, worked out the life-history of this parasite in some de- tail at 30&deg;C. The present observations on the non-parasitic stages of the tick were carried out at 22&deg;C., a temperature slightly lower than that used by Nuttall, and a relative humidity of 80 to 90 per cent. In all cases the parasitic stages of the tick were accomplished on the dog. I. Observations relating to oviposition. Two batches, the first of 29 and the second of 20 gravid females, were kept under observation. Oviposition commenced three to six days (av., four days) after the gravid female left the host, the process of oviposition lasting 14 to 18 days (av., 15.6 days). The female survives 2 to 14 days (av., six days) after oviposition ceases and lays 1485 to 3556 (av., 2140) eggs. II. The duration of egg stage. The duration of the egg stage as calculated from the com- mencement of oviposition to the date of emer- gence of the first larva was found to be from 25 to 40 days (av., of first batch 31.9 and of the second batch 31.3 days). III. The larval stage. More than a 1,000 individuals were observed. These divided into 16 batches were put on the host for feed, the host being maintained at 1.4 to 11.6&deg;C. The percentage of engorged larvae recovered on the fourth day was 62 to 75, on the fifth day 14 to 30 and on the sixth day 1 to 2 only.

Subsequently, as no ill effect was observed, the feeding was continued by drenching the plant suspension in water. Even then, however, the animals showed no symptoms of toxicity. In view of the numerous cases of accidental and homicidal poisoning with the plant, reviewed by Van Itallie and Bylsma [1928] and Steyn [1934], it was considered that the soil and the climatic conditions in the hills at a height of 7,500 ft. might have affected the alkaloidal content of the plant. A feeding experiment similar to the above was, therefore, undertaken at Izatnagar (Table II) in the plains. The few symptoms that the bulls showed on feeding at the rate of about 1-2 lb. per day were constipation, bulging of the eye-balls with reddish discolouration of the lens, dilation of the pupils, slight drowsiness and an accelerated pulse.

114 Sire Index for Milk Production in Cattle These observations are in confirmity with those of Steyn [1931], though Frohner [1919] reported the death of a horse within 52 hours of feeding 2.25 kg. of mature seeds. ACTIVE PRINCIPLE Van Itallie and Bylsma [1928] found the total alkaloidal content of 0.2 to 0.5 per cent to consist chiefly of hyoscyamine in the leaves and 0.2 to 0.4 . per cent of hyoscyamine and hyoscine respectively in the seeds; Steyn [1934] reported a total alkaloidal content of 0.43 per cent, chiefly hyoscyamine. Chou [1935] dis- covered datugen and datuguinine amounting to 0.3 per cent., in addition to hyoscyamine, hyoscine and atropine. Fluck [1939] found that re-wetting or checking the drying process and harvesting the wet plant gave low alkaloidal yields. Sirgo [1939] observed that Datura seeds exposed to acetylene or carbon monoxide gases matured earlier but contained a lower alkaloid content than normally-ripened seeds. DISCUSSION The observations recorded in Table I and II indicate the innocuous nature of Datura stramo- nium growing in the two localities. A number of factors affect the toxicity of the plant, import- ant among them being (1) the amount eaten in a given period of time; (2) the condition of the soilP. V. SUKHATME 115 are of the kind available on the farm. It does not show how the sire would behave if the dams are of a higher level, nor does it help a breeder to compare the breeding value of two bulls from different forms. The Sire Index on the other hand, is an estimate of the breeding value of a sire in terms of yield of milk and can tell a breeder what and how much he can expect of a sire when used on mates of any known level. It follows that a breeder would prefer to adopt a sire index rather than a progeny test, provided the sire index gave a reliable estimate of the breeding worth of sire. In actual fact it is doubtful if sire index is absolutely so. The common form of sire index, known as the 'Commercial Mount Hope Index', makes use of the assumption that the offspring averages mid- way between the two parents. We do not know how far this assumption is valid, although in a character like the milk-yield which is deter- mined by multiple genes, it is not expected that this assumption would be far from the truth. Then again a sire index is relatively more influenced by environmental differences than is a progeny test. As against these considerations progeny test in Fisher's 't' form, as observed above, is of limited use to a breeder. Logically the progeny test and sire index are not mutually exclusive, as one is a test of signifi- cance and the other is a problem in estimation, and, therefore, the question of prefering one to the other does not arise. The appropriate course is to make a test of significance and then construct a sire index. This, however, would involve considerable computational work. For the present, therefore, it is suggested that the use of sire index alone be introduced in our breeding farms. It is not proposed to discuss the relative merits of the various indices that have been advocated for measuring the breeding worth of a sire. The most common of these are (1) the Daughter Average Index, which is the average milk-yield of all daughters of a sire, and (2) the Commercial Mount Hope Index, also known as the Intermediate Index, which is the difference between twice the average milk-yield of daughters and the average milk-yield of their mothers. The first uses information on all the daughters of a sire, regardless of whether their mothers were tested or not, and consequently, is suitable for application in villages and on new farms where the mothers' milk-yield may not be known, whereas the second uses information in respect of only such daughters, whose mothers have been tested. The first is a statement of fact independent of any assumption, whereas the second is a hypothetical figure based on the assumption that the offspring average midway between the parents and is, therefore, depen- dent for its reliability on the validity of this assumption. Both are affected by environ- mental errors, but the second probably is more affected than the first. Notwithstanding these advantages in favour of the first, the Commercial Mount Hope Index is generally preferred by the breeders, because it helps to predict the performance of a sire on mates of any known level, whereas the other, does not. Further statistical research on Indian data on the rela- tive efficiency of the two indices, and on the validity of the assumption used in the const- ruction of the second index, is clearly needed, but in the meantime, it would appear that the Intermediate Index would be the more useful. The formula for the Intermendiate Index is directly derived from the assumption that the offspring averages midway between the sire and the mother, and is given by [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] where D and M are the average milk-yields of daughters of the sire and his mates (mothers of daughters) respectively. The reliability of this index is obviously dependent on the magni- tude of the environmental and the sampling errors. The former of these errors arise from the difference between the environments of mothers and daughters and the possible selec- tion of mothers, whereas the latter, arise principally from the sampling nature of inheri- tance. Where it is reasonably certain that the environmental conditions of daughters are not distinct from those of their mothers, lest we credit or blame the sire for something which was due to the environment and where the mothers have not been particuarly selected, this index is influenced only by the errors of sampling and can be depended upon to give a reliable idea about the sire116 Sire Index for Milk Production in Cattle factors affecting milk-yield in order to reduce sufficiently the environmental errors. This is usually done by standardizing (1) the order of location, (2) the length of lactation and (3) the number of milkings per day. The effect of selection of dams is to under- estimate the value of the sire i.e., to make the sire appear as if he does not possess a high measure of the transmitting ability, when in fact he does. The means by which we can allow for this effect, at least partially, is to use a slightly larger level of probability in tests of significance than is conventionally done. This will be explained later. It is usual to include first lactation yields in calculating the idex even though they are not an absolute index to the performance in later lactations. The reason for their use is that a breeder wants to have the earliest indication regarding the value of a sire and cannot wait until all the later lactation yields are available. It is, of course, advisable to recalculate the index, as later lactations are recorded, but care should be taken to avoid the bias that is likely to be introduced by the selection of dams and daughters that may have taken place in the meantime. Usually, the later lactation yields are reduced to their equivalent first lactation yields with the help of approved conversion factors before recalculating the index. No such factors have, however, been worked out for use in India. The appropriate course is to work out a regression of yield on the -order of lactation from the material locally available and use it to convert the later lactation yields to their equivalent first lactation yields before recalcul- ating the index. This would secure the com- parability of one index figure with another. The procedure can be used whether the lacta- tions of dams and daughters are the correspond- ing lactations or not. Where the order of lacta- tion of all mates of a sire is not known, though records of milk-yields are available, the proce- dure is only slightly different. No standard method can be suggested in either case, but statistical technique to suit the requirements of the data can be devised. Length of lactation is another important factor influencing the yield of milk. If the lengths of lactation of dams and daughters are unequal, sire index based on lactation yields may give a misleading idea about the value of the sire. Table VI showing the dam-daughter differences for yield and the length of the first lactation, gives an idea of the extent to which the length of lactation may influence the yield of milk. In calculating the index, it is usual to allow for the difference in the length of lactation by considering the milk-yields of the first 300 days. In India just now, it might be possible to. provide for the reporting of the first 300 days' yield in registers maintained on some farms, but it will be sometime before this can become general. In the meantime, the only course available is to recalculate the yields from what records there are, but these may not suffice, and at any rate, the procedure would involve considerable time and labour. As an alternative, the lactation yields may be adjusted to the standard length of 300 days by the use of regression. Logically, this is actually a more appropriate method, since it uses complete in- formation on lactation yields. Moreover, it has an added advantage of minimizing the sampl- ing error of the sire index. In this method, the observed relationship between the yield and the length of lactation is used to adjust the yields to the standard length of lactation. Details of the method are illustrated later in Tables II and III. The number of milkings per day is another factor influencing the yield of milk. Milk-yields obtained under twice-a-day milking conditions are usually used in calculating the index. Where the number of milkings is more than two, the records are usually corrected to twice- a-day milking condition with the help of approv- ed conversion factors. In India, twice-a-day milking is a general, and consequently, the use of such factors would be only rarely called for in practice. Where, however, they are needed, they may be worked out from the available past records. Even when the milk-yield records of dams and daughters are equalized, the differences between them will still be affected by errors which are partly systematic and partly random. In so far as the systematic errors are concerned, one can merely make a close study of the environ- ment and make allowance such as one thinks to be the fairest for departure from normal conditions, but beyond that, there is little that one can do, e.g., differences arising from the. practice of weaning in mothers and daughters. Random errors are easier to deal with. They cancel out in the process of averaging. Conse- quently, when the number of dam-daughters pairs is sufficiently large, the sampling errors of the average milk-yields is small, and the index can be relied upon to give an accurate indica- tion of the breeding worth of a sire. The concept of sampling error is relatively new to breeders, consequently, it is not yet usual to calculate the sampling error as a guide to the reliability of the index. It is, however,
P. V. SUKHATME 117 obviously important not to misjudge the value of a sire by taking his calculated index at its face value. The calculated index is only an estimate in terms of yield of milk of the true breeding worth for milk production of a sire. It is, therefore, imperative to know the mag nitude of the sampling error, so that a breeder may know the extent to which the index is likely to vary from chance causes. The sampling error is measured by what is known as the standard error in statistics, and is calculated in the manner illustrated in the examples given below. It is usual to add and to substract from the calculated value of the index a fixed multiple of the standard error to know the extent to which the index is likely to vary due to chance. This multiple is given by the value of Fisher's t corresponding to the number of pairs less one or used in calculating the index. By convention Fisher's t at the 5 per cent. level of probability is used as multiple. In breeding problems, however, it seems appro- priate to use the 10 per cent level of probability since by continuous selection the genetic vari- ance is reduced to a level at which genetic differences become difficult to detect. It is as important not to underrate the value of a sire as it is important not to overestimate it; and it would, therefore, seem that 10 per cent is the most suitable level. The table below shows the 10 per cent values of t taken from Fisher's book on 'Statistical Methods for Re- search Workers' and is reproduced for ready use by breeders. n = 1 2 3 4 5 6 V 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 10% = 6314 2.920 2.353 2.132 2.015 1.943 1.895 1.860 1.833 1.812 1.796 1.782 1.771 1.761 1.753 n= 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 80 10% = 1.746 1.740 1.734 1.729 1.725 1.721 1.717 1.714 1.711 1.708 1.706 1.703 1.701 1.699 1.697 As to how many dam-daughter pairs are necessary to prove a sire, the answer depends upon how sure of his proof one wants to be and how much can be gained by testing more daughters. If the systematic differences bet- ween the environments of dams and daughters are large, even after carrying out all the sug- gested adjustments, the accuracy of the sire index will remain low under any circumstances howsoever large the number of dam-daughter pairs may be. On the other hand, if the en- vironmental differences between dams and dau- ghters are correctly discounted, the sire index may be considerably increased in accuracy by increasing the number of dam-daughter pairs. It will thus be seen that it is difficult to fix the minimum number of dam-daughters pairs requi- red for calculating the index. The number of dam-daughter pairs as recommended by differ- ent workers varies widely. While there is no harm in using as low a number of pairs as two or three for deriving an indication of the breed- ing worth of a sire, it seems undesirable to publish an index based on fewer than six pairs, The concept of sampling error is applicable to a group of records which can be adequately expressed by means of their average and the degree of variability around it. When we say that dams on a farm are of a particular level, we imply this condition. Consequently, it is im- portant to make a statistical test of signifi- cance to cull out extreme records which cannot be regarded without hesitation, as random members of the group. Such a test is valid only after the records are adjusted to environmental differences and is justified only on the mothers' records since an exceptional record in daughters may result from the sampling nature of inheri- tance. It is, however, beyond the scope of this note to describe this test for the rejection of extreme records. The detailed procedure of calculating the Intermediate Index is explained below on the records of Sindhi bull No. 38 from Hosur Cattle Farm, Madras. Table I shows the main steps involved in the calculations of the index. Columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the table show the milk yield records with the corresponding num-
118 Sire Index for Milk Production in Cattle ber of days of the first lactation of mothers and daughtersP. V. SUKHATME 119 It will be seen that the value of the Interme- diate Index is 4259 lbs., its sampling error is 295 lb. and the extent to which the figure of 4259 is likely to vary due to chance is 529. In other words the best estimate of the true breed- ing worth of the sire measured in terms of yield of milk is 4259, but this estimate is likely to err on either side to the extent of 529. A breeder thus knows that, provided the environ- mental errors are correctly discounted, he can use the sire with confidence for increasing pro- duction of daughters when the mates are of a level below 3730 lb. Tables II and III give the calculations re- quired for adjusting the yields of mothers and daughters to the standard length of 300 days. From the total of the figures in col. 4 is sub- stracted a figure called the correction factor, which is equal to the quotient of the square of the total of col. 3 by the number of pairs. The figure so derived is the corrected sum of squares of the days of lactation. Similarly from the total of the figures in col. 5 is substracted a figure, a correction factor, which is obtained by dividing the product of the totals of col. 2 and 3 by the number of pairs. The remainder is called the corrected sum of products. The corrected sum of products divided by the corrected sum of squares of the days of lactation gives a figure called the regression coefficient, 'b', of the milk yield on the days of lactation. In column 6 are entered 300 minus the figures in col. 3. Column 7 shows the products of the figures in col. 6 with 'b'. Column 8 gives the sum of the cor- responding figures in cols. 2 and 7 and shows the yields adjusted to 300 days of lactation.

SENIOR-WHITE 123 TABLE VI124 Life History of Musca Planiceps Weid chorion unruptured, has been found in a speci- men with fresh blood. A female released 10 hours from eclosion, and unfertilized, has been recaptured 24 hours later with a blood meal already partly digested, and with a larva fairly advanced in development, (but still rather soft and diffluent) and a mature egg. A speci- men with a stage III larva was found with an immature egg with no signs of embryonic deve- lopment and only one more developing egg in the follicles. It would thus appear that as soon as a larva is born the uterus receives an egg ready to hatch from one ovary whilst the other ovary completes the development of the next egg. The female genitalia are figured fig. 227, in Patton and Evans [1929]. The length of time spent by the larva in utero is unknown. The larva lies head forward in the uterus, but turns prior to birth. Mature eggs removed from the mother and placed on saline damped wool do not hatch. Birth. On arrival the mother fly usually runs about on the surface of the cow-dung mass for about half a minute, examining it. She then chooses for preference a depression in the upper surface of the dung, otherwise the plane upper surface is chosen, but the steep sides of the slope of the pat are usually avoided. Becoming motionless, the tip of the abdomen is slightly depressed. After a short but dis- tinct pause, birth rapidly takes place. The 'after birth', consisting of the chorion of the egg and the moults of the first two instars, intermingled, is attached to the posterior side of the larva at about two-thirds of its length from the head and is rubbed off as the larva enters the dung, remaining on the surface as a white speck. After birth the mother fly is not usually easily disturbed for a few moments, probably due to exhaustion, and may then fly straight off, or stop and feed at the dung. In nature delivery is almost always head first, exceptions being usually under-sized females, in which there is possibly no room for the larva to turn. But when killed artificially, a fair number of flies give birth tail-end first. In neither case is the well-being of the larva affected: if it occurs in nature the larva turns straight over and burrows, if aborted by maternal death the larva can equally burrow immediately. Larvae can live within a dead mother,G. D. BHALERAOG. D. BHALERAO 125 Attempts to feed flies in captivity on human blood exuding from a prick, on raw meat exud- ing serum, on sugar solution, and on fresh cow- dung have all failed, though as noted under larviposition, this is sometimes sucked" at in nature. The species resembles the non-biting haema- tophiles in that it is never seen so engorged that it cannot fly well, unlike Stomoxys, which engorges until it can hardly move, and ingested blood never shows so clearly through the abdo- minal well as, for example, in M. ventrosa. Even full term females are fairly nimble. The species always rests on the upper side of grass blades etc.126 Chemotherapy of Helminthic Infections of Domestic Animals been tried in vitro only, have been avoided, for when tried in vivo, they undergo dilution below the therapeutic threshold, a change occurs in their chemical composition, and the manner of excretion alters their efficiency. DISTOMIASIS OF RUMINANTS Hall [1921] used carbon tetrachloride as an anthelmintic with excellent results. Recently it has been proved very efficacious and suffi- ciently cheap for adoption in mass treatment, the cost working out at about half-an-anna per dose. The dose for sheep is 1 c.c. and for larger ruminants 5 to 10 c.c. It is given in liquid paraffin in the proportion of 1:4. Other cheap oils, such as groundnut oil or cotton seed oil, may be substituted for paraffin. As only the adult worms in the liver are destroyed by this drug, the dose should be repeated about a month later. It is usually administered orally, but Pegreffi [1939] recommends intra-ruminal injection. He states that pregnancy is not a contra-indication to its use in oily solution. Obitz and Wadowski [1939] treated 3,000 fluke infested sheep by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride in liquid paraffin. The average time of treatment was one minute per head and the cost was one dollar per 100 sheep. 1,600 sheep were cured with only five acci- dents. The drug is an excellent remedy for fascio- liasis of ovines, but it is somewhat toxic to bovines. In our experience, however, the bovines recover from the toxic symptoms in about a couple of days. Its toxicity is of a complex nature and mainly consists of the re- tention in the blood of bile pigments which combine with the ionised blood-calcium and are excreted as such, causing hypocalcimia. It also causes the retention of guanidine in the blood; this interferes with the conversion of glycogen into blood-sugar and causes hypo- glycæmia. The pathological effect is chiefly on the liver, resulting in central necrosis and fatty degeneration. Guanidine and calcium are antagonistic to each other in their behaviour and the ad- ministration of calcium controls its toxicity; 75 to 150 c.c. of calcium gluconate is administer- ed by injection, or calcium chloride with ammonium chloride or calcium lactate given orally. Injections of sodium xanthine (liver extract) is said to protect animals against carbon tetrachloride poisoning. Before and after the treatment, the animal should be fed on a carbohydrate diet. Fats and proteins should be strictly withheld, as fats increase the solubility of the drug and cause its absorption through the lymphatics, while proteins cause an increase in the production of guanidine. As there is a heavy drain on calcium in animals during lactation, greater care has to be exercised in such cases. To decrease the toxicity and to promote a rapid excretion, a dose of magnesium sulphate may be given. Hexachlorethane (Igitol, Distol) is as effec- tive as carbon tetrachloride and is much safer, but it is somewhat costly. The dose for sheep is 6-8 gm. The doses recommended for the treatment of cattle are 20 gm. per 50 kil. of body-weight, to be given for four successive days in the morning, three to four hours before feeding. The milk of cows undergoing treat- ment may become slightly tainted, and milch cows fed on concentrates may develop symp- toms of colic. Sprehn (1936) recommends two intra-mus- cular injections of 20 c.c. of Fuadin for Dicrocælium dendriticum of sheep. On the 10th to 12th day the fæces is completely free from eggs. GASTRO-INTESTINAL HELMINTHS IN RUMINANTS These chiefly consist of Hæmonchus contor- tus, Mecistocirrus digstatus, Osteriagia spp., Bunostomum spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Chabertia sp., Trichuris sp., Oesophagostomum spp., Cooperia spp. and tapeworms. Carbon tetrachloride is very effective against Hæmonchus, Bunostomum, etc., but not against Trichostrongylus. This drug can pro- fitably be employed for the combined treat- ment for fasciohasis and parasitic gastritis. Carbon tetrachloride in combination with copper sulphate has been used with very good results, and regular monthly treatment pro- duces a marked improvement in the quality of the wool of sheep [Ross and Graham, 1933]. A drug that has come into great prominence during the past four years is Phenothiazine (ThiodiphenylamineG. D. BHALERAO 127 administered with food. The dose for sheep is 25-30 gm. and that for cattle 30-80 gm. in some cases the doze may be repeated after a fortnight. It has been claimed that it is 100 per cent effective against Hæmonchus and Ostertagia, 90 per cent against Bunostomum, 84 per cent against Oesophagostomum, 76-80 per cent against Trichostrongylus and only 15 per cent against Cooperia. The anthelmintic action of Phenothiazine is due to thinol secreted into the intestine by way of the biliary tract. Bile facilitates its action. It first becomes leucothinol and then thinol. It is suggested that, since all individuals may not be equally capable of converting it into thinol, the. administration of the drug with or without bile will be the next step in the line of treatment. Apart from its therapeutic value, it also acts as a prophylactic. Phenothiazine-salt mixture offered to sheep for daily consumption in the proportion of 1:9 to 1:14 is effective in pre- venting the development of parasitic larvæ in the fæces. Their development is arrested 48 hours after the administration of 0.5 .gm. or more. It thus prevents pasture contamination. In therapeutic doses it is not toxic, but in doses of 70 to 200 gm. it may cause inflamma- tion of the alimentary canal, tympanites, loss of appetite, weakness of the muscles, sweating, a friable yellowish liver, enlarged kidneys, incoordination of the hind quarters, severe diarrh128 Chemotherapy of Helminthic Infections of Domestic Animals value of giving 2.5 c.c. of a 10 per cent solution of copper sulphate to sheep immediately before the administration of a drug. This stimulates the vagus of the pharynx and brings about the closure of the G. D. BHALERAO 129 three doses of 15 gm. each or three to five doses of 10 gm. each should be given in bran. Intravenous injections of Stavarsol destroy the larvæ of strongyles and cyclicostomes. The dose is 5 gm. repeated three to ten times. Lang [1936] claims that, intravenous injec- tions of 5 per cent sodium chloride and 5 per cent sodium citrate, in 2 pint doses, destroy the thrombus formation. HELMINTHIASIS IN DOGS Hexyl-resorcinol has been shown to be effec- tive against ascarids and hookworms. It is irritating to the mucous membrane and should be administered as a powder. It decomposes gelatin and is ineffective when mixed with oil. It is administered in freshly filled gelatin cap- sules or in sugar coated tablets. The dose is 250 mg. per kilo. of body-weight. Hexylmetacresol is said to have all the good, and none of the bad, qualities of hexylresorcinol. Carbon tetrachloride has been found to be very effective against hookworms and has in recent years become very popular. The dose is 0.3 c.c. per kilo. of body-weight and is ad- ministered in gelatin capsules, with the neces- sary precautions (see-distomiasis). Some workers claim that a mixture of carbon tetrachloride and oil of chenopodium in the proportion of 2 c.c. of carbon tetrachloride and 20 min. of oil of chenopodium is more effective than the former alone. Both drugs can be given mixed in the same capsule, followed an hour later by a dose of magnesium sulphate. It is said that the drugs are supplementary to one another, and for this reason the dose of each individual drug can be reduced. The toxicity of the combination is not greater than that of the drugs themselves when administer- ed separately. One c.c. of chloroform mixed with 30 c.c. of castor oil has been recommended for ancy- lostomiasis. Phenothiazine is useful for ascarids, hook- worms and whipworms. The dose is 3-10 gm. It is not toxic. The injection of at least one gm. of pheno- thiazine in the vicinity of a Dracunculus ulcer reduces invalidism and hospitalization. The drug should be made into an emulsion with olive oil. water and adeps lanæ. Prontosil, in combination with emetine hydro- chloride, brings about a rapid and redical cure in dogs infested with Paragonimus westermanii. Hydrogen peroxide, sodium permanganate and sodium hyperborate are said to be effective against most of the worms of dogs and are quite safe. It has been claimed that a rectal injec- tion of 1.5 c.c. removed all tapeworms (either vomitted or passed in fæces) and most other worms. There were no ill effects. Arecoline hydrobromide has proved to be the drug of choice in the treatment of tæniasis of dogs. The dose is 2 mg. per kilo. of body- weight. The drug frequently causes nausea and vomitting and is best administered in gelatin capsules together with chlorotone (about 5 grains per 10 kg.). The worms are passed within 10 to 20 minutes. Nosik [1940] states that arecoline hydrobromide in doses of 0.002 to 0003 gm. per kilo. followed by the extract of male fern in a dose of 0.2 to 0.3 gm. per kilo. and repeated after 10 days is 100 per cent effective against Echinococcus granulosus and other Tænia- spp. It has some effect against ascarids, but is ineffective against Mesoces- toides. Iso-amyl-ortho-cresol is specific against Dipylidium caninum. The dose is 0.1 c.c. per lb. of body weight, followed by a dose of magna- sium sulphate. Brooks and Brown [1942] consider that ficin is 100 per cent effective against ascarids, 96 per cent against Trichuris dispar and only 13.6 against Ancylostoma caninum. It is totally ineffective against Dipylidium caninum. The dose is 750 to 1,000 mg. of the drug per kilo. of body-weight to be given as a 15 per cent aqueous suspension by a stomach tube, followed, three to four hours later, by 1 gm. of Epsom salt per kilo. in a saturated aqueous solution. Gentian violet has been recommended for Strongyloides stercoralis of dogs as it has been for man. The dose is 15 to 17 mg. per kilo. body-weight. N-butyl chloride in a dose of 0.3 c.c. per kilo. body-weight is useful against hookworms and ascarids. Wright et al. [1933] states that a rectal injection of 1 oz. per 20 lb. of body- weight removes all cæcal worms. N-butyl bromide and N. amyl bromide are stated to be 100 per cent effective against Ancylostoma caninum. 'Rotenal' (the active principle of Degvelia) is useful against hookworms and ascarids of dogs, in doses of 0.2 gm. per kilo of body-weight. 'Nemural', a pyridine derivative, is effective against tapeworms of dogs. The dose is 18 mg. per 15 lb. of body-weight. A tablet dissolved in water can be given after a light meal and should be followed by an enema. No laxative is necessary. The drug is not toxic. The tapeworms, especially Dipylidium caninum.
130 Chemotherapy of Helminthic Infections of Domestic Animals are removed within 5 hours. Pumpkin seeds are useful against tapeworms of dogs and man. The dose for dogs is 5 gm. and for man 30 gm., and its administration should be followed by a purgative. The following drugs have proved to be effec- tive against the heart worm of dogs, Dirofilaria immitis: (1) According to Brown and Sheldon [1941], a ten-day course of daily intra-muscular injec- tions of 1 to 2 c.c. of Fuadin and the oral administration, twice daily, of 20 to 25 gm. of sulphanilamide. The onset of otochitis indi- cates the death of the parasites. (2) Five injections of 6 c.c. of Antimosan at an interval of three to four days. [Kaka, 1937]. (3) 'Stibsol' (antimonian-3-catechol-thiosali- cilic acid-sodium, containing 30 per cent of antimony) has been recommended by Brown and Austin (1939). It kills the female worms in the right side of the heart of the dog, and the dead worms are absorbed by the lungs. It also removes microfilariæ from the circulatory system. Two or three intra-venous injections are sufficient. The treatment is equally effective against heavy and light infec- tions. HELMINTHS OF POULTRY Carbon tetrachloride is very effective against the large round worms of poultry. Tetrach ore- thylene has also been claimed to be a good remedy, but it is not so effective as the former drug. The dose is 1 to 2 c.c. with 3 to 4 c.c. of oil. Both are powerful agents, and therefore over-dosing should be avoided. The drug should be administered in a gelatin capsule or through a flexible rubber tube introduced directly into the crop. Colloidal iodine preparations are becoming popular and have proved satisfactory. A 10 per cent solution in water injected into the gizzard, in doses of 1 oz. to a bird weighing 4 lb., is stated to have removed 89 per cent of nematode, and cestodes. The worms evacuated were completely dead. Stafseth and Thompson [1932] claim it to be 100 per cent. effective against tape and round-worms. Phenothiazine in doses of 0.2 to 0.5 gm. is satisfactory for Heterakis and Capillaria. Bleecker and Smith [1933] claim that a mixture of nicotine sulnhate and kamaln. in the proportion of one-fourth drachm to 0.2 c.c., is 100 per cent effective for all common worms of fowls, with the exception, of cæcal worms. Levine [1938] states that the areca nut is the only successful drug for the removal of Davainea proglottina. It removes all scoiices. The dose is 2 gm. to a chicken. Synthetic pelltierine, tin oleate, stannous oxalate and tetra-iso-butyl-tin remove Raillie- tina cesticellus and Hymenolepis carioca of chickens. Recently Harwood and Guthrie [1940] have struck a despondent note regarding all treat- ments of poultry tæniasis. They tried 223 sub- stances and 27 mixtures. Of these only lead arsenate exhibited any promise as a poultry tæniacide, but it was found to be too toxic in effective doses to be recommended for general use. Pyrethrum powder containing 8 per cent pyrethrine is considered to be 95 per cent effective against Ascaridia galli. The dose is 200 mg. to be administered in gelatin capsules. An aqueous solution of the drug, 1 in 100, is also used administered through a - gum elast c tube. N-butyl chloride is stated to be very good for Ascaridia. The dose, according to Wright and collaborators [1933] is 1-6 c.c. The following drugs have been stated to be very effective against gapeworms: Clapham [1935] recommends the administra- tion of garlic oil or the synthetic product, allyl sulphide, into the trachea by means of a pipette. The dose ranges from &#8531; to 3 min. to be given as a 33.3 to 50 per cent solution in linseed oil. The drug is very powerful, rup- tures the worms and renders the eggs sterile. Allyl sulphide is cheap and less pungent. Delaphane and Stuart [1939] treated gape- worms of pheasants with 100 per cent success by instilling a few drops of iodine vermicide into the trachea. Wehr and collaborators [1939] found that the dusting of birds with barium antimony tartrate powder is more than 98 per cent successful against gapeworms. The drug is automatically inhaled. Our experience at Mukteswar shows that birds fed on bits of raw garlic carry very little worm burden. CUTANEOUS HELMINTHIASIS For parafilariasis, Losev and collaborators [1937] recommend subcutaneous or intra- venous injections of an aqueous solution of iodine and the washing of the affected areas with 1 per cent phenol. Intravenous injections of 100 c.c. of 2 per cent aqueous extract of tartar emetic have also been recommended.
G. D. BHALERAO 131 The drugs recommended for stephanofilariasis are Cooper's 'Lavene' or Cooper's 'Dip' and intravenous injections of tartar emetic. Against habronemiasis,- intravenous injections of Antimosan or tartar emetic are given. The following powder is applied until the wound is healed: Plaster of Paris 100 parts, naphtha- line 10 parts, alum 20 parts and quinine or bitter powder 10 parts. NASAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS Intravenous injections of 1.5 grains of anti- mony tartrate for every 100 lb. of body-weight of the animal are repeated daily for six days or 2.5 grains every alternate day. GENERAL One notable discovery that has been made during recent years is the addition of char- coal to santonin, oil of chenopodium or carbon tetrachloride reduces the toxicity of these drugs, without interfering with their anthelmintic efficacy. An automatic drenching gun has been intro- duced for administering fluids to sheep. The apparatus consists of a gun with knapsack con- tainer. It is adapted to give doses of 1-2 oz. Mention may be made of the methods adopt- ed by Moskey and Harwood [1941] to evaluate the efficacy of anthelmintics. The tests may be grouped under vitro and vivo tests. The latter may be sub-divided into (1) dilution egg-count test, (2) the critical test and (3) the controlled test. In vitro tests: they cannot be accepted until adequate in vivo tests have been performed. For example, pineapple juice dissolves ascarids in vitro but the juice has no effect on ascarids in vivo. In vivo teste: the drug which is useful for one kind of worms in one animal may not have the same efficacy in other hosts. Dilution egg-count test. Stoll's method can- not be used as a true indication of the anthel- mintic efficacy of a drug, since the drug may reduce the reproductive capacity of the worms without eliminating them. This method can- not be used in testing the effectiveness of a tæniacide or of indication aimed at parasites whose eggs do not appear regularly in the fæces. Critical test. This was first advocated by Hall. It consists in counting the number of worms in the total amount of fæces passed on three or more days and then adding to the re- sult the total number of worms obtained at necropsy. This test must be repeated on a sufficiently large numbers of animals. Flaws: (1) Worms may be eliminated by other cause than anthelmintics, (2) the killed worms may be digested by their hosts, and (3) these tests are not useful in the case of tæniacides. The scolex may not be eliminated. The animals' should therefore be retained for two or three weeks to allow the worms to grow. Occasion- ally, the scolex may be destroyed, presumably by digestion after it is killed. Controlled tests. These are done in cases of artificial infection. In the case of fowls, 10 birds should be used for artificial infection and 10 as controls. Safety. No drug should be advocated unless its therapeutic index is known. Finally mention should be made what Hagena [*1936] considers to be the ideal anthelmintic. It contains paracymene, thymol, castor oil and kamala. It has been claimed that it has effi- cacy against all species of worms and is of low toxicity. REFERENCES Bleecker, W. L. and Smith, R. M. (1933).

KAURA 133 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Distribution of common cattle feeds in India [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Distribution of important breeds of cattle in India It is a well-known fact that in the rice growing tracts and flooded areas of Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madras, Travancore, etc. cattle are gene- rally found to be greatly deteriorated, both as regards their physical development and capacity for work and milk production. They are also more prone to diseases, and reproductive defects are common in them. It is also a common ex- perience in these tracts that when foreign animals of any breed are introduced for the grading up of local cattle they deteriorate rapidly. In other scattered rice growing areas like Kangra district in the Punjab, Gorakhpur district in the United Provinces, Malabar coast of Madras, Chhattisgarh district in the Central Provinces, a similar type of deteriorated cattle is found. In these areas the cattle being inefficient, the number of cattle required for agricultural purposes and for milk pro- duction is necessarily larger, even three to four times as compared to that of other areas where good cattle exist. The larger number of cattle causes greater strain on the available pastures which results in their further deterioration, thus producing a vicious circle. In the States of Travancore and Cochin where the cattle are of a mongrel, non-descript type and where there are no recognized breeds, cows are notoriously poor milkers, the yield obtained being not more than that of a good goat elsewhere. The bullocks are puny and weak and on this account the ryot is generally unable to adopt and make use of modern, efficient and labour-saving implements. To improve the agricultural prac- tices and provide more milk for the people the Travancore Agricultural Department imported bulls from the adjoining British Indian districts and Indian States, with a view to grade up local cattle. The Ongole, the Kangayam and the Amritmahal were the chief among these breeds. These carefully selected bulls were stationed at the Government Cattle Farms to serve the farm cows as well as the cows belonging to the local public, but the bulls did not thrive well and soon deteriorated. The calves born to them were also not satis- factory. They were, therefore, discarded. Yet another attempt was made and bulls from upper India belonging to the Sahiwal, the Sindhi and English cross-breds were imported and tested. Of all these breeds, the Sindhi, a medium sized breed, has fared the best and appears able to with- stand the local conditions admirably. The United Provinces has been divided into five definite tracts according to the types of cattle found: (i) The dry western tract (rainfall 20-30 inches) which includes the area west of the Ganges, stretch- ing from Cawnpore to Saharanpur, including 14 districts which form part of the Agra, Meerut and Allahabad Divisions. In this tract good types of cattle, sheep and goats are to be found, and the soil and climatic conditions of the tract lend them- selves to improvement being effected in the existing types. (ii) The central humid tract (rainfall 30.45 inches) consisting of the highly cultivated areas of parts of the Rohilkhand, Lucknow and Fyzabad Divisions. In this tract only animals of moderate size and mediocre efficiency in draft and milk are produced and better classes of animals, if intro- duced, tend to degenerate. (iii) The tarai tract, situated at the foot of the Himalayas (rainfall 45-65 inches). This tract includes areas where grazing is in abundance, but only small types of draft cattle can be raised. This tract has no cattle or buffaloes of milk type and better types of cattle degenerate rapidly.
134 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India (iv) The Bundelkhand area of many different soil formations where types vary noticeably with the different types of soils. (v) Hill tracts which can produce only the poorest and smallest types of cattle and where cattle from other tracts tend to rapid degeneration. Within the above tracts, however, there are to be found some areas which, though situated in a tract where generally poor types of cattle are raised are favoured in some way or other by suitable soil and fodder conditions and are, therefore, able to produce within these circumscribed areas cattle much superior in type to the general type of the tract. In the rice-growing tracts of Bengal and Bihar, the condition of the cattle is very similar to that seen in other rice-growing tracts of India. Poor specimens of small stunted animals are commonly found in these areas. In Bihar, inspite of avail- ability of plenty of grazing in the region where the Kosi river flows, the cattle and buffaloes are of a degenerate type, the average milk yield of cows rarely exceeding one seer a day and that of buffaloes varies from two to five seers a day. At the Military Dairy Farms in the Punjab, Sind, North-West Frontier Province, and Baluchistan, it is said that the cattle do not appear to suffer from any mineral deficiency. There is some evidence to show that cows in the United Provinces and the Central Provinces benefit by the addition of mine- rals to their diet. Generally, yields of cows increase as one travels north and east of Delhi upto a height of 5,000 feet but excluding a narrow strip at the foothills of the Himalayas. In ad- dition, the high country in the Central Provinces and the Deccan is fairly good in certain localities, for example Jubbulpore and Secunderabad, al- though it rains too much at Jubbulpore and cows fall off in condition during monsoon. The United Provinces is not good and gets worse as one travels towards Bengal. Coastal areas are bad, until Karachi is reached which area is fairly good and improving as one travels north. Ruk and Rohri are too humid for cows due to the Indus river. In this broad outline, there are, of course, certain local exceptions. High humidity combined with high temperature has been found to be the worst combination. In the opinion of many, no milch animal can stand the strain of producing large quantities of milk in such a climate for long and the breed deteriorates. The best buffaloes are bred in fairly dry localities and the ideal locality for buffaloes appears to be a place where there is a temperature of about 100&deg;F. in the day and about 70&deg;F. at night, lots of green fodder, coarse if necessary, and opportunity to wallow during the major portion of the day. The deterioration is not confined to individuals only but also extends to their progeny, thus causing a long range drop in efficiency of incalcu- lable magnitude. The under-fed bullock is un- able to perform work satisfactorily, the semi- starved bull is incapable of producing strong and virile progeny and the ill-nourished cow gives very little milk. Besides the loss in milk yield, the cow under such conditions of malnutrition does not breed properly or regularly, often brings forth weak and sickly or dead calf and thus causes a further deterioration of the stock. All these under-fed animals fall easy victims of the ravages of disease and thus causes further expense and loss. This deterioration of cattle has a far- reaching effect on the agricultural operations and human nutrition and health. In the words of Sir Robert McCarrison [1927] it must be realized that the problems of animal husbandry are also the problems of human husbandry. In these notorious areas, improvement of cattle cannot be effected by any method of breeding, unless the causes of deterioration are removed. The scientific demonstration of a definite cause or causes for a condition offers the best chance for introducing preventive and curative treatment. The problem of deterioration of cattle is a very vast one and its causes may be many. From the information available from other countries, it is probable that diseases and internal parasites like helminths, intestinal and blood protozoa, etc. play an important role in livestock deterioration and bring about heavy losses, though there can be no doubt that the low untritive value of the natural pasture is another main cause of stock deterioration, especially amongst village cattle in India which depend al- most entirely on grazing. The endocrines as affected by the deficiency of minerals, vitamins and proteins, trace elements like cobalt, manganese fluorine, selenium, etc., and environmental factors such as climate, humidity, temperature, rainfall, etc. also significantly affect the health of cattle. REVIEW OF WORK DONE A. Foreign countries A review of available literature on the subject shows that many notoriously bad areas for cattle breeding are known in Africa, Europe, Australia and other countries. A revolution has followed the discovery of phosphorus deficiency as the immediate or ultimate cause of serious losses in this branch of Agriculture. Extensive research work has been carried out on the various aspects of the problem and it will be of interest to review the same briefly in this note. It has long been known that food must contain lime and phosphorus for the formation of bone and other inorganic salts for the blood and soft tissues. As early as the beginning of last century it was recognized that the lack of these might be
R. L. KAURA 135 the cause of abnormal conditions in sheep and cattle. By the middle of last century it was proved that some of these conditions in cattle, occurring in certain districts in Europe, and es- pecially in the winter months and in seasons of drought, were due to the lack of either lime or phosphorus in the pasture or fodder. In parts of South Africa, Australia and the United States lack of phosphorus in the pasture is associated with a disease which goes by various names, but is. characterized during the life of the animal by stiffness of gait, slow growth, poor breeding capacity, general unthriftiness and pica (i.e., a ' depraved ' appetite for substances such as old bones or earth) and on post-mortem examina- tion, by a soft or brittle condition of the bones. It has been shown, under experimental condi- tions, that lack of lime in the rations of cows may be the cause of failure to breed successfully, the calves being either born dead or with such low vitality that the death rate is high. Lack of sodium and chlorine has been proved to be a cause of unthriftiness in milk cows. Iron and iodine are also needed by the animal, but only in traces. It is believed, however, that deficiencies, less marked than those referred to above as the direct cause of certain abnormal conditions, may exist and be the cause of a degree of malnutrition which affects the rate of growth and production, and may possibly render the animals more sus- ceptible to specific diseases. Orr [1930] has suggested that in order to balance up the rations with minerals one should calculate from the known composition of the carcasses of animals or of products such as milk, the amounts of each of the different minerals which must be absorbed from the intestine and retained in the body for the building up of the bones and other tissues in growth, or used for the elaboration of products such as milk. For example, calcium (calculated as CaO) is present in the bodies of cattle to the extent of about 2 per cent and the percentage of phosphorus (calculated as P2O5) is only slightly less. Therefore, young cattle putting on 2 lb. per day live P2 O5 weight would need to absorb and retain more than ½ oz. of lime per day. Every gallon of milk con- tains about ¼ oz. of lime and &#8531; oz. of phosphoric acid; hence a cow giving four gallons of milk a day would lose each day about 1 oz. of the former and 1&#8531; oz. of the latter in the milk. Only part of what is contained in the food is absorbed from the intestine and even what is absorbed is not all available for formation of new tissue or for milk, because there is a continuous, loss through ex- cretion. Hence, the food must contain more than is required to be retained in the body or secreted in the milk. To make up for calcium and phos- phorus deficiencies, ground limestone and steriliz- ed bone meal may be used respectively. Eraser [1935] has stated that wild herbivora and native breeds of cattle seem to be less liable to the effects of mineral deficiency than imported breeds of high fertility, rapid growth and heavy milking type, because such functions require more phosphorus than the natural pastures of a large area of the world can supply and therefore the improved breeds may die, lose type or revert to scrub under less favourable conditions. Progressive deple tion of minerals in pasture lands exerts quite an apparent influence on the general well-being of the stock resulting in conditions like osteophagia, delayed maturity, etc. He has suggested that the. mineral deficiency can be combated by supplying the deficient mineral element in adequate amount either by direct feeding or indirectly through crop by manuring the soil, the latter appearing theoretically a more natural method. Recently du Toit, Louw and Malan [1941] have published their final report on a study of the mineral content and feeding value of natural pastures in the Union of South Africa. In this study, originally it was decided to analyse the soil from selected areas, the herbage growing on the soil and the blood of cattle grazing on the pastu- rage. It was thought that a definite correlation existed between these three sets of data. But after the first three surveys which were reported on separately by du Toit et al [1932], the collection of soil samples was discontinued. The results warranted the conclusion that soil analysis does not provide a satisfactory method for studying the feeding value of natural pastures, as pasture on poor soil may yield excellent values if the sam- ples for analysis are taken at an early stage of growth of the pasture. ' Animal ' samples of natural pasturage were collected and chemically analysed. These samples were collected by follow- ing the animals at pasture in order to ensure that such samples were as closely as possible representa- tive of what the animals actually consumed on the day of collection. Judged by the estimated requirements of cattle and sheep for growth all South African natural pastures, composed mainly or wholly of grasses are deficient in phos- phorus, crude protein and in certain areas, sodium for a period ranging from five to nine month of the year, depending on the area. There are indications that in certain of those regions the pasture may be deficient in phosphorus also throughout the year. Furthermore, on the basis of the average value for phosphorus, these grass pastures contain at no time of the year sufficient of this nutrient to pro- vide in the requirement for an additional function (e.g., gestation or lactation) of the animal, super- imposed on growth. Theiler [1934] described in detail the clinical and histopathological features of the skeletal diseases of animals caused by mineral
136 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India deficiency or imbalance and has cleared up the existing confusion in their classification by using the terms in their precise histopathological sense. He has also suggested that the endocrine mechanism may be of significance in controlling the mineral metabolism, a point which needs fur- ther research. Humphrey [1931] has remarked that vitamins are substances of very pronounced physiological activity, and can produce remarkable changes in the normal body, even in minute doses. An ade- quate supply of vitamin A in the blood is necessary to maintain the mucous membranes in a stage of full physiological activity, including their functions of preventing bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, Vitamin D can be used with advantage to increase the bactericidal power of the blood and is of importance in connection with calcium and phosphorous metabolism. Vitamin E appears to be essential for normal reproduction and lactation. It is found in the unsaponofiable fraction of wheat-germ oil, and shows close relationship to the group containing Vitamins A and D. Green [1938] has reviewed the importance of trace elements in veterinary science. Many of the obscure diseases have now been attributed to the trace elements. Since plant food is the basis of animal life, any trace elements present in the plant are likely to be found in traces in the animal body as well, where they may exercise a beneficial effect (e.g., copper, cobalt, manganese) or a harmful effect (e.g. fluorine, selenium and molybdenum) or be entirely inert (e.g. boron). ' Nutritional anaemias ' described under various names in various countries were considered to be due to iron deficiency and pre- vention of the disease could be achieved by pro- viding licks of crude iron compounds. But, it is- now known that catalytic trace elements arc frequently involved in the aetiology of these naturally occurring conditionsR. L. KAURA 137 supplementation of winter pasture with the object of increasing the protein intake of animals should greatly benefit the cattle and sheep industries of their country. Leitch [1937] has remarked that in addition to the direct influence of under-nutrition or mal- nutrition due to imbalance of the constituents of diet, vitamins, proteins or minerals on growth, fertility and production, there is the other, possibly even more interesting and important, indirect effect through its modifying action on susceptibility to infections. There is evidence that it may be an important pre-disposing factor in infection with Br. abortus. Ross and Graham [1933] have specifically investigated the effects of the im- proved pastures in (a) increasing the degree of parasitism owing to the heavier stocking carried, or (b) so improving the nutritional state of the sheep that the animals are able to resist infestation or at least the effects of infestation. Ross and Gordon [1933] pointed out that in sheep kept on a diet low in protein and minerals the resistance to Haemonchus contortus was completely broken down. Richardson [1935] has stated that it may be that climatic factors affect the protein and mineral contents of a pasture and the difference in mineral content of pastures in tropical and temperate regions may be caused by a differential effect of climate on the rate of nitrogen and mineral uptake on the one hand and rate of growth on the other. Bonsma [1940] has discussed the influence of climatological factors on cattle and is of opinion that livestock react strongly to climatic changes, because these changes affect their vital physiologi- cal functions such as internal combustion or meta- bolism, respiration, body temperature, habit, fertili- ty, etc. The activity of endocrines like the pitui- tary and adrenal glands is also affected. The problem of under-development of cattle in tropi- cal and sub-tropical regions is closely connected with the climate and temperature of the regions in which the animals are kept. Teodoreanu [1938] has reported that domestic animals brought from one region to another show variability of different degrees depending on the influences of climatic and food changes on their constitution, resistance, production, etc. It is possible to distinguish three types of such modifications. 1. In the first, the animals are subjected to non-hereditary modifications which can be ob- served and appraised by a competent eye and com- bated by prophylactic measures. The different parts of the body are subjected to slight diminu- tions from the original size. Robustness suffers as well as the productions of milk and beef. 2. The second class embraces animals showing hereditary variations during several generations. Constitution and production diminish until ap- proaching that of the local breeds. 3. The third class embraces those animals that fail to become acclimatized. These degenerate gra- dually and disappear after three or four generations. Henderson [1931] in discussing the relationship of pica in cattle to trypanosomiasis has concluded that (a) Pica in Northern Nigeria bears a close relationship to trypanosomiasis of cattle, (b) the infection by trypanosomiasis causes an acidosis in animals with consequent upset of the ' alkali reserve ' of the blood, (c) the excessive excretion of sodium and calcium during an acidosis cannot be compensated by the amount of these elements in the herbage normally grazed by cattle, (d) the uncompensated loss of sodium and calcium leads to a craving for salts containing these elements and it is expressed by the showing of pica symp- toms. Bisschop [1940] read a paper entitled ' Bionomic studies on indigenous and exogenous cattle in the semi-arid regions of the Union of South Africa ' at the Seventh International Genetical Congress, Edinburgh in August 1939 and the suggestions for work under Indian conditions contained in this note are based largely on the work reported in his article. B. India Under-nutrition, owing to lack of sufficient fodder for animals in the country, is probably the most important limiting factor to the development of cattle in India. In addition to general lack of fodder, however, there are in some areas marked deficiencies of minerals, protein and certain vita- mins in the fodder. It is known that in many districts, in this sub-continent, the soil is poor in phosphates. Thus in Bihar soils, Davis [1918] found that the total phosphorus percentage varied between 0.086 to 0.137 and the amount available from a trace to 0.002 compared with about 0.27 and 0.16 respectively in good soils. The report of the Department of Agriculture of Madras for 1918-19 states that the crying need for almost all crops in Southern India is phosphoric acid. This poverty of the soil in phosphorus affects not only the composition but also the bulk of the pas- ture. Deficiency of phosphorus in the soil is, therefore, probably an important factor, both in under-nutrition and in malnutrition. Davis [1917] attributes low milk yield of cows in Bihar to defici- ency in phosphorus in the pastures, and McCarrison [1927] has stated that in Bihar and on the coast of Malabar mortality among cattle is high, sterility is common, and the milk yield of cows low. These conditions are associated with pica. MaCarrison suspects the cause to be lack of phosphorus. Warth [1927] puts forward the idea that it is probable that cattle in India suffer from deficiency of minerals other than phosphorus and that there may be a deficiency of common salt, i.e. of
138 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India sodium and chlorine. It is a well-known fact that lack of salt has an adverse effect on the health and productivity of cattle and that the requirements for salt are specially high in hot climates. The extensive investigations of McCarrison [1913] have indicated that there is a shortage of iodine in areas in the region of the Himalayas, but so far as is known this shortage is not associated with high incidence of goitre and its sequelae in cattle, though these conditions are very preva- lent in human beings in some of the Himalayan regions. The economic importance of deficiency of mine- rals in the pasture was referred to by several witnesses giving evidence before the Royal Com- mission on Agriculture in India. Warth [1927] offered the opinion that it was impossible to lay too much stress on this subject. He believed shortage of calciu m, phosphorus, sodium and chlorine occurred in various parts of the Empire and that deficiency of phosphorus was perhaps the most important Indian problem. McCarrison [1927] who has done exceedingly valuable work on deficiency diseases also emphasized the impor- tance of deficiency of minerals, especially of phos- phorus and iodine, in causing malnutrition which he regarded as the most far-reaching cause of disease in India. Olver [1933] has stated that one of the fundamental causes of degeneration of stock and loss to stock-owners is defective nutri- tion due to ill-balance or actual deficiency of essen- tial food ingredients. Ware and Sen [1937] have indicated as a result of a survey of the problem of malnutrition carried out at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, that the effect of these deficiencies is not confined to a general physical deterioration of the stock, their productive power has been affected, breeding difficulties have become more common and susceptibility to certain classes of disease has been increased. To give a few illus- trations on the above point, mineral deficiency has given rise to pica and osteomalacia in Madras and Hyderabad and the stunted growth of ani- mals in Berar has been ascribed to the same cause. This is probably also true in parts of Bengal, Bihar, and Assam. Milk yield in most of these areas is low, mortality is high and sterility is common. The disease known as 'blindness in calves ' which is usually associated with a non- specific form of abortion in cattle has been shown to be due to malnutrition. It will thus be seen that the problem of malnutrition is an all-India one, but it may be found necessary to tackle this subject regionally because the type of malnutrition may not be the same in every part of the country. They have emphasized the necessity for investi- gations of a comprehensive nature to study the preoblem of animal nutrition in relation to main- tenance of health, normal growth and increased productive capacity of animals in India. Ware [1937] has discussed the importance of grazing in regard to the development of cattle and dairying industries in India and has made appropriate suggestions for the extension and improvement of pastures in India. Valuable studies of Indian grasses and grasslands have been made by Burns, Kulkarni and Godbole [1925 and 1928] with special reference to the Province of Bombay having varied climatic conditions and consequently different kinds of grasslands and have made useful recommenda- tions for the improvement and proper utilization of grasslands. Lander [1937] has briefly summarized the graz- ing condition in the different provinces and has recorded the results of chemical analysis of common Indian fodders and grasses grown on different soils and under different geographical and climatic conditions and at various stages of growth. He has also given the results of mineral survey of the Punjab soils carried out by him. Referring to certain special areas which are noted for the rich- ness of natural fodder and the excellence of ani- mals which graze it, he has stated that the most notable of these is perhaps the Government Cattle Breeding Farm at Hissar comprising some 37,000 acres of natural grazing land, part of which is enclosed as irrigated paddocks. Hissar is the home of the famous breed of Hissar cattle which thrive to perfection on the highly nutritious grasses found in this area. The chief of these are (1) Anjan (Pennisetum cenchroides), (2) Bur (Andropogon laniger), (3) Panni (Andropogon muricatus ), (4) Palwan (Andropogon pertusus ) and (5) Dub (Cvnodon dactylon). Anjan is the best grass on the bir (grazing ground); it grows over vast areas and is highly nutritious; it makes first class hay and has proved to be a most satisfactory ration. Viswanath [1941] in his presidential address to the Section of Chemistry and Biology at the 10th Annual Meeting of the National Academy of Scien- ces has reviewed the recent developments in the Science of Plant and Animal Nutrition and their significance to national nutrition and health and has emphasized the importance and value of cattle manure for the growing of crops. It is unfortu- nate that at present cattle manure, an extremely valuable fertilizer, is used more as a fuel in the form of uplas than as a manure. His experiments carried out in collaboration with McCarrison [1927] and with Suryanarayana [1927] have shown that the grain from cattle-manured crops, which showed greater vigour and grew a better plant, also possessed better nutritive value and higher protein and vitamin content than the grain from the mineral-manured or unmanured crop. Organic manures, besides improving the physical condition
R. L. KAURA 139 of the soil and being sources of the ordinary food constituents for plants, also supply some agents like auximones or vitamins which contribute greatly to the growth and reproduction of plants. In addition to their bio-chemical activity, the micro-biological population of the soil contributed directly to the plant some stimulant which is ultimately passed on to the animal. It appears that auximones for plants and vitamins for animals are probably the same, or if different, exist together and are independent, functioning in different ways, according to the organism in which they are introduced and the conditions under which they operate. Sen [1933] has stated that a good breed will deteriorate if kept for a long time on a defective ration. He has referred to the harmful effects produced by the excess of fluorine in the diet of cattle in fluorine-rich areas, especially where fluor- spar deposits occur and has stated that this subs- stance is found in India in certain parts of the Central Provinces (Raipur District) and in some places in the Punjab and Madras Presidency. He is of the opinion that deranged endocrine func- tions (e.g. thyroid, pituitary) are likely to be asso- ciated with unbalanced rations supplied to the animals. He has stated that a very curious fact is that most of the good animals in India come from the tracts where rainfall is low and water is scarcely available. With the increase in the irri- gated areas and consequent increase of crop pro- duction, grazing areas are getting fewer in number and animals coming from irrigated tracts are much inferior in condition, so far as their performance is concerned, and, moreover, these animals are more susceptible to parasitic infestations and diseases in general. Experiments carried out by Roy and Sen [1933] at Mukteswar, which is situated at an average elevation of about 7,000 feet above sea-level in the Kumaun hills, show that with the growth of the plants and increase in rainfall, the percentages of lime and phosphorus in pasture grasses increase to a maximum in September-October. After this period, the amount of phosphorus decreases considerably with the approach of winter and dry conditions. No marked decrease in the lime content, however, takes place. They are of opinion that during the winter months, the ratio between lime and phos- phorus may be abnormally high, and hence a ration composed mainly of a winter-cut hay with- out the addition of phosphorus-rich concentrates, may induce aphosphorosis and malnutrition in cattle. Sen [1935] has stated that deterioration seen in most of the indigenous breeds in India is due to a number of causes, of which malnutrition and disease are probably the most important causes and which are to a large measure inter- dependent. To a great extent indigenous animals appear to have adapted themselves to the type of food-stuffs available in this country, namely to a diet containing a low amount of protein and minerals and a fairly high amount of fibre, but the net consequence of this malnutrition has been the survival of a type of animal which is small, un- developed and economically very unproductive. The milk yield of the cow is low, breeding difficulties are common and in the case of draught animals, the return in terms of work is very small. Large numbers of such animals exist throughout India and are, from an economic standpoint, a serious loss to the country. Any attempt to improve the animal industries of India must, therefore, take into account the need for adequate and well-balanced diets for domesticated animals of all kinds, and in order to study which constitute a well-balanced diet, systematic research work on the nature of our food-stuffs is essential. He has also emphasized that there is an intimate connection between malnutrition in cattle and malnutrition in human beings. Sen and Seshan [1938] have described the various conditions, e.g., congenital blindness, night-blindness, abortion, lowered vitality, etc., associated with avitaminosis A in cattle and have suggested the ways and means of controlling these conditions in the field. The available sources of this vitamin or its precursor (carotene) for livestock are discussed and suitable methods of preserving green fodder with minimum loss of carotene are given. Lander [1939] who made a comprehensive nu- tritional survey of the Kangra Valley has remarked in introducing his note on the correlation be- tween soil deficiencies, poor cultivation, unthrifty cattle and human nutrition that not only were the cattle of this district of a small size but they give very little milk and a majority of these were dry during the greater part of the year. The main fodder of these cattle during the greater part of the year was rice straw, very rarely supplemented by concentrated food. It was deficient in protein, calcium and phosphates. This unsatisfactory system of agriculture led to insufficient supplies of animal products like milk to the inhabitants who, therefore, suffered from deficiency diseases like osteomalacia, goitre, etc. He stated that high rainfall involved considerable leaching from the soil of soluble minerals, the most conspicuous of which was calcium. He suggested that each province should endeavour to concentrate on most out- standing features of malnutrition in their territory and having found the causes should set to work to remedy them. Olver [1937] in discussing the relation of animal nutrition to public health in India has suggested that village cultivators and stock-owners should produce more fodder crops, more and better farmyard manure or compost and better stock, thereby increasing their income and
140 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India the nutrition of the family, while maintaining the fertility of their holdings and making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of public health. Gorrie [1937] has stated that the awful deteriora- tion in the type of cattle wherever common grazing persists as the usual practice is a most striking and consistent feature of Indian animal husbandry. This deterioration is seen at its worst in all dis- tricts containing large areas of wild land, too steep or too poor for cultivation, and, therefore, includes the whole of the Western Himalayas and the many ranges of lower hills further south. In these common grazing areas almost every kind of live- stock competes for a living and large migratory flocks of sheep and goats which descend from the high hills every autumn to the adjoining, plains, like locusts in their number, cause sheer des- truction of the available grazing. On the other hand, better-known breeds of Indian cattle are found in areas where there is practically no common grazing ground left, e.g. dry areas of the Punjab and where the people have been forced to rely mainly upon stall-feeding and to concentrate upon fewer and better animals. At the time when hay ought to be made in the months immediately following the monsoon, the cultivator is busy with his autumn ploughing, so the cutting of grass is inevitably delayed until only the dry bones of the grass crop are left. It is not possible to alter the agricultural calendar, so improvements appear to lie along the lines of grass cultivation by contour ridging and by any other means which keep the grass green for a longer period. Shah [1939] has stated that it is a well-recognized fact that the in- tense over-grazing to which the ravines and other grazing grounds in the United Provinces are sub- jected prevents the maximum production of fodder, and that the only way to increase the fodder supply from uncultivated lands is to reduce the incidence of grazing. In ravine areas, goats, in particular, are most destructive to the natural vegetation. The finest cattle in the Provinces are to be found in districts like Meerut where the grazing grounds are at a minimum and the worst cattle in districts such as Jhansi where the grazing grounds are at a maximum. It is of little use to spend money on breeding bulls and improved breeds of cattle, un- less the improved breeds and their progeny are better fed. The only way to do this is to grow more fodder on cultivated lands and to reduce the intensity of grazing on uncultivated lands. Aiyer and Kayasth [1931] have analysed the grasses and fodders growing in different parts of Central Provinces and Berar and have found that the grasses are very poor in phosphoric acid, calcium and nitrogen contents. The grasses grown on heavy black soil are, however, richer in mineral content than those grown on light soil. The poor stunted growth of the eattle in Chhattis- garh may be due to the phosphate deficiency in the ration. They are of the opinion that the lime deficiency may not be so pronounced as phosphate deficiency, for jowar, kadbi, paddy straw and wheat straw which form a good part of the ration con- tain high proportion of lime. They have suggest- ed that the addition of an oil-cake may make up the phosphate deficiency and the lime or nitrogen deficiency, if any, can be made up by the addition of leguminous fodders, e.g. berseem, jowar, soyabean kulthi, etc., in the ration. In the rice tract, the rice polishing (kunda) which is rich in phosphoric acid should not be wasted but utilized in feeding to the cattle. In the wheat tract bhusa of the leguminous crops should form a part of the ration to the cattle. Iyer [1935] has shown that the mineral composition of grasses may be affected by the type of the soil, the species of grasses, maturing and cultivation. Chaudhuri [1933] has reported that calves which were stunted in growth improved considerably in weight and condition after being fed a mineral supplement. Bhalerao [1934] has stated that in India there are numbers of ailments of cattle which go un- noticed and undiagnosed and which, although not in all cases apparently serious, undermine the health gradually and render them incapable of serving humanity to their proper extent, while in some cases they even take their toll of life. Such diseases are usually caused through the agency of worms which are parasitic in the various organs of these animals. Although exact data are not available at present in regard to the loss that is actually caused by worms, it is certainly larger than generally imagined. The Veterinary In- vestigation Officers working under the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research schemes have discovered the existence of nutritional disorders, e.g. osteomalacia, pica, infertility, eye-troubles etc. and high incidence of parasitic infestations in certain parts of India which include the notorious tracts referred to in this note. The Council's Helminthological schemes and the nutritional schemes have thrown and will throw in due course more light on these aspects of this vast problem of deterioration of cattle. Carbery, Chatterjee and Talapatra [1937] have carried out a fairly compre- hensive series of experiments to determine the mineral requirements of cattle in the rice growing tracts in north-east India. The reuslts indicate that aus straw is considerably superior to cmen straw in minerals and protein and hence in general feeding values, but both straws are poor in phos- phate and slightly deficient in lime. The phosphate might be conveniently supplied through cake while a small supplement of chalk would make up lime deficiency. Rice kura (bran) is very poor in CaO and unsually rich in phosphate (over 6 per cent). The CaO and chlorine figures have
R. L. KAURA 141 (definitely given a negative balance; while inspite of heavy P2O5 ingestion (39 to 59 gm.) a negative balance has been recorded up to the stage of 43 gm. This is probably due to the presence of phosphorus in the rice bran mainly as phytin which is not readily assimilable. Rice bran should, therefore, be supplemented with lime and chlorine on one side, while its phosphorus compound should be brought into assimilable form by hydrolysis. In the case of green feeds, Guinea grass is better balanced than Napier and Hyacinth, but the feed- ing should be regulated in order to avoid a large ingestion of lime. Napier grass should be supple- mented with CaCO3 and both Napier and Hyacinth should be so regulated as not to involve a larger ingestion of potash through them. They both (specially Hyacinth) require some cake supple- ment. Hyacinth is often used as a fodder in some parts of Bengal when there is a fodder scarcity. Chatterjee [1942] has stated that in the rice- growing tracts rice straw has been and will proba- bly remain the chief roughage and as its use must have largely contributed towards the present situation its judicious feeding is of much impor- tance to the future well-being of cattle. The main deficiency with rice straw is that it is very poor in protein and phosphorus and contains a large quantity of crude fibre on one side and an interfering substance (oxalic acid) against a proper absorption of lime on the other. Again depending on the nature of feed combinations, the digesti- bility of straw protein varies from nil or even negative to 3, 4, 5 per cent going up to 37 per cent. When a balance sheet was drawn of the intake and outgo of the essential body components, more protein, lime, magnesia and phosphorus were drained out of the body than were supplied in the feed, with the inevitable result that the animal lost in condition, body weight and thriftiness. As soon as the animals were provided with a suitable concentrate (linseed cake) a valu- able combination of protein and phosphorus ensued with the result that not only did the general appetite and consumption go up but there was definitely better utilization and assimilation of the food components and the animals gained in the weight. Ramiah [1939] has stated that an area in the Kurnool district was investigated as a deficient area in phosphoric acid as revealed in the pasture survey. A disease commonly known as Vayu- Potlu resembling ostomalacia or arthritis is ende- mic in that area. Blood phosphorus was very low, giving a blood picture of pronounced imbalance. The presence of fluorine and mineral imbalance are factors operative in the incidence of the disease. A similar field survey of cattle in South Kanara district showed less pronounced symptoms of deficiency resulting in general poverty of condition in cattle. Herbage protein studies revealed that manuring has a marked effect on the total nitrogen content and type of distribution of nitrogen in the herbage of cereals. Anwar Ullah [1939] has stated that most of tne constituents, especially the minerals in the fodders, tended to decrease with advancing age, the main exception being in the case of nitrogen-free ex- tract which always increased with age. In certain cases, of course, this did not hold true which is mainly explained by some disturbing conditions, such as damages due to drought, flood, etc., or disturbing conditions like manuring, etc. In- fluence of soil conditions in Bihar was very marked and it may be said that all fodders grown at Sabour, Darbhanga, Pusa and Patna are expected to be rich in most constituents, especially the important ones like protein, calcium and phos- phoric acid, whereas the fodders grown at Kanke, Jamui, Nawada and Banka are generally ex- pected to be poorer. Exceptions, of course, exist but these show the general trend. Though there were no controlled experiments on the effect of seasons on the composition of fodders, yet it is observed in a general way that the fodders grown in the 1938 season were richer than the fodders grown in 1936 or 1937. In some cases the 1936 crop was also richer than the 1937 crop, which seem to have been the poorest in recent years. SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS To elucidate precisely the causes of degeneration of cattle in various parts of India is a difficult and complicated problem requiring systematic in- vestigation and involving considerable expense and time. For such an investigation it is necessa- ry that data should be collected from the affected areas regarding local environment, e.g., climatolo- gical factors, condition of soil and water, nutritional deficiency including that of important minerals like calcium and phosphorus or their imbalance and of vitamins, especially fat soluble vitamins, A, D and E, the excess or absence of trace elements like fluorine, cobalt, manganese, etc. and the inci- dence of diseases and parasitic infestations in- cluding blood parasites etc. The probable causes of deterioration in these areas should first be sorted out and the point settled whether the various suspected causative factors act singly or in combi- nation by actual experimentation upon batches of local cattle and cattle imported from good areas where deterioration is not marked. The actual number of these batches will depend upon the number of suspected etiological factors, e.g., cli- mate, diet, parasites, etc. and the possible com- binations in which these factors may be operating, keeping suitable control. In each experimental batch the unwanted factor or factors should be completely eliminated as far
142 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India as possible, e.g. by supplying the deficient mineral or vitamin or protein in adequate quantities by the most suitable route, by overcoming parasites by regular use of suitable drugs and examination of faeces or blood as the case may be, by dealing with the trace elements as required, and by regular im- munization of the animals against the prevalent contagious diseases like rinderpest, haemorrhagic septicaemia, etc. Regular data in detail with photographic records should be collected from all the animals before the commencement of the ex- periment and during the course of the experiment and the beneficial results accruing therefrom in regard to growth, milk production, capacity for draught and reproduction should be observed. Chemical and biological analysis of blood, skin and hair studies and, where necessary, accurate clinical and detailed post-mortem examination should be carried out. This kind of investigation can be carried out successfully only if long-range experi- ments are planned, say for a period of at least ten years, and it should be remembered that such a comprehensive investigation may produce very important and far reaching results. However, by a careful analysis of the available information on the subject, some general con- clusion can be drawn with which it might be possi- ble to take some steps immediately with a view to tackling this serious problem with some degree of success. The following points arising out of the review of the existing literature deserve careful consideration: 1. Grow fodder crops. Good cattle are found in comparatively drier parts of the country where people grow or are forced to grow fodder crops for the maintenance of their cattle in the absence of sufficient pastures. It seems, therefore, necessary that if cattle-wealth of the poorer areas is to be improved a suitable proportion of the land should be under fodder crops. To make the agriculture more remunerative and the cultivators healthier and more prosperous, it is essential that fewer cattle with greater production and capacity for work should be maintained and fed properly utilizing the limited fodder resources in the best possible way. 2. Balance rice straw. Rice straw is the staple cattle feed in the humid rice growing tracts of India where poor type of cattle with stunted growth, very low milk yield, stamina and capacity for work are generally found. Even good cattle imported from healthier areas tend to deteriorate in these areas in course of time. Rice straw is deficient in protein, phosphorus and vitamins and contains a large quantity of crude fibre on one hand and oxalic acid which interferes with the proper absorption of lime on the other. Knowing that protein is the body builder, calcium and phos- phorus the bone former and vitamins essential for wholesome assimilation of food and proper de- velopment and functioning of the body, it is not difficult to imagine what the cattle lose when they are fed mainly on rice straw. Under the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research animal nutrition scheme in Bengal, Indu Bhushan Chatterjee has shown that these defects in rice straw can be reme- died by balancing it up with the addition of the locally available feeds such as oil-cakes (ensures valuable combination of protein and phosphorus), rice bran (contins protein of high biological value and is rich in aoil and phosphorus*) and pulses (rich in proteins) in small quantities along with some green forage (especially to supply vitamins). Calcium and phosphorus supplement, e.g. a small quantity of powdered chalk and sterilized bone meal flour may be added to the diet when neces- sary. A fairly good sterile bone-meal flour can be prepared locally by the following method: In an open vessel, meat-free and comparatively fresh bones may be cooked in boiling water for sufficiently long period till the bones become soft enough to disintegrate on beating. The broken chips of bones are again cooked twice, every time in fresh boiling water. The cooked bones are finally washed thoroughly in hot water. After allowing them to dry in the sun for two to three days, they are crushed into powder. This bone meal powder or flour prepared for feeding stock, should have but little odour, and should be nearly white in colour. 3. Control of parasitic and bacterial diseases. Humidity in the soil and air is more favourable for the development of parasites, especially hel- minths and the spread of soil-borne bacterial infections like Anthrax, Black-quarter, etc. Acute bacterial infections may cause heavy mortality, but losses from these diseases can be prevented by the use of appropriate sera and vaccines issued by the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Regular vaccination of stock against these diseases in infected localities preferably before the onset of monsoons is desirable. Parasi- tic infestations both external and internal and chronic protozoan infections cause deterioration of the affected animals by adversely affecting their growth, milk yield and capacity for work, although in most cases they may not succumb for years. Regular administration of parasiticides against internal parasites and the use of cattle- dips against external parasites and the tick-borne protozoan infections should be extensively em- ployed in these areas as a routine. 4. Prevent soil erosion. As a result of heavy rains the soil may be denuded of mineral matter and the fodder on such areas does not grow luxuri- antly and does not contain enough of mineral *It is not present in an assimilable form, but it can be rendered assimilable by hydrolysis
R. L. KAURA 143 constituents essential for proper animal growth, production and reproduction. Where necessary soil erosion may be prevented by resorting to bunding in the plains and by terracing and gully traping in the hills, etc. 5. Improve pastures. Pasture where available is usually the cheaper feed as well as one of the best for feeding either milch or draught cattle. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 3
144 Deterioration of Cattle in Certain Parts of India Although in humid areas pasture lands are found here and there, yet on account of injudicious and overgrazing by much larger number of livestock than can be maintained on them and due to their ill management they do not serve the desired purpose. Not only the grazing areas should be extended by utilizing more of the land under the control of the Forest Department and that class- fied as ' cultivable waste ', but what perhaps is more important is that the existing pastures should be properly developed and well managed. Im- proved varieties of grasses should be introduced, ' bunding ' may be made use of, rotational grazing, both in regard to pasture land and species of animal grazed, should be practised allowing restricted number of healthy livestock only, shady trees and drinking water should be made available, the land should be suitably dressed and manured where the soil and plant analysis indi- cates any deficiency, etc. 6. Trace elements. Where there is an indication that any of the beneficial trace elements e.g. copper, cobalt, manganese, etc. is lacking in the cattle feed, it should be provided in a suitable form. On the other hand, if there be evidence to believe that any of the harmful trace elements e.g. fluorine, selenium, etc., is present in intolerable quantities in the diet, necessary steps should be taken to get rid of such an element by the proper method. In the Province of Madras fluorosis has been shown to be the cause of rheumatic arthritis locally called ' Vayu-Potlu '. If drinking water contains 1.0 part or more of fluorine per million parts of water, it causes fluorosis. It has been found that the addition of lime removes the greater part of fluorine from water and renders it harmless. 7. Resistant breeds. There is some evidence to show that different breeds of cattle and buffaloes vary in their ability to stand the conditions pre- vailing in humid rice-growing tracts. Some are more susceptible than the others, though ultima- tely all might revert to something like the local cattle. Undoubtedly, the local cattle having adapted themselves, though degenerated, can stand these conditions best. Therefore, the best policy seems to be to imporve the local cattle on one side by grading them up with a suitable breed possessing sufficient ability to resist the local environments and on the other by providing econo- mically balanced food and freedom from parasitic and other diseases. Under a scheme to be financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research it is proposed to study the effect of humid climate in rice-growing tracts on the four important breeds of cattle and buffaloes which are largely imported into cuch areas viz., Hariana, Sahiwal, Sindhi and Murrah, keeping suitable controls in. a healthier area and providing similar food in similar quanti- ties and freedom from parasitic and other diseases. The results of this scheme will show the order of resistance amongst these breeds. Fig. 3 illustrates how deterioration of cattle is pro- bably brought about in the humid areas and briefly indicates the methods to be adopted to remedy the same. It is hoped that the above suggestions will be of some interest to those who are confronted with the problem and that they will collect systematically where possible such data as might indicate the suitability of certain recognized Indian breeds of cattle for different tracts in the country where cattle are deteriorated at present. Such data and those to be obtained in due course under the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research scheme might help the livestock officers, cattle owners and the Government in affected areas to plan a well organized scheme of work on a large scale in order to tackle this intricate and important problem effectively.

No. 16. 146 A plea for a broader system of Veterinary Education usually followed in India, and one may expect in due course to see all the Indian veterinary colleges affiliated with the local University and turning out graduates to fill the more important posts in the Civil departments, their work being supplemented by Stockmen', a cheaper agency which can be trained in a few months to carry out much of the routine work for which a vete- rinary department is required in India today. In a previous article which appeared in this journal for January, 1939, I endeavoured to sketch the early development of the veterinary profession and the establishment of veterinary colleges in India, and those who are interested are referred to that article for details. It is sufficient in the present connection to record the fact that there are 2,471 veterinary gradua- tes in the employ of the Civil Governments in India today. Of these, eighty are Members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, England. These men are employed on all types of work, ranging from curative work in veterinary hospitals to those more important duties which may be included in the compre- hensive title of Animal Health. This number constitutes the majority of veterinary graduates in the country, but by no means exhausts the list, for others are employed in the Defence Department, local bodies, private practice, etc. In numbers, therefore, the veterinary pro- fession in India is no mean part of the total Empire services, but even then they are quite inadequate for the prodigious number of animals for whose health and improvement they should be responsible. Apart from other animals, of which there are many millions, there are over 200,000,000 cattle in India, about one-fourth of the total cattle population of the world. Those who have visited India will say: What cattle! One could very well do without many of them. This is true in part, but recent investigations have shown that if India is to cultivate her land properly and have sufficient milk for her wo- men and children, she will require about that number of cattle. But they must be better cattle, and that is the major problem before Indian Veterinary Departments of the future. How can productivity of India's cattle, and other animals, be increased within a reasonable space of time? It certainly cannot be done by the disjointed methods that have been adopted in many parts of India in the past. A real punch is required, and to get such a punch it is essential that there should be livestock de- partments (call them what you will) in each province, in which all aspects of the subject are closely coordinated by a master mind at the top. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that livestock improvement will not succeed without the help of the veterinarian, and the veterinary profession must identify itself very closely with livestock improvement and increased production if it is going to survive as a separate entity, at least in a country like India. It may well be asked what the veterinary profession in India has been doing all thses years not to have seen that such an obvious arrangement was made for the development of the livestock of the country. Thirty-five years ago when one made an application for a post in the Indian service one was supplied with a me- morandum which stated, amongst other things, that one might be employed on administrative work, teaching duties, or horseABSTRACTS 147 the Army. These absorbed the bulk of the gra- duates and on the whole the system will have been considered to have satisfied requirements, but as a training for potential research workers and for those called upon to deal with the health of livestock in the mass, which is the lot of most of those who elect to serve outside the British Isles, it was sadly lacking in several respects. This in itself might not have been very serious, for being recruited largely from the stock-owning classes British veterinary sur- geons were soon able to adapt themselves, to the changed conditions, but unfortunately the tradition has been passed on to India, where the training of veterinary graduates in the past has followed very closely the British system. How can the position be remedied? The departmental Committee which considered the subject of veterinary education in the British Isles a few years ago made a number of very sound recommendations for its improvement and it is most unfortunate that it has not been possible to give effect to any of these during the war, for every year that passes provides us with a batch of new graduates who appear, to those working abroad, to be lacking in certain essentials of their profession. We require men whose training has been woven round the sub- ject of animal physiology and have practical expereince of animals in health and production, as well as in disease. A veterinary student can- not spend too much time on physiology. Not. only does this subject from the best stepping- stone to many branches of veterinary science in which a man may wish to specialize, e.g., pathology, immunology, dietetics, genetics, pharmacology and up-to-date clinical medicine, but no other subject in the veterinary curriculum will do so much to broaden a student's mind and increase the imagination, in which so many veterinary graduates, who have been trained in short cuts for passing examinations, increasing cash returns or swelling the out-patients regis- ter, are wanting. We require men whose con- ception of preventive medicine does not begin with the use of a hypodermic syringe after a disease appears in a village, but with the sel- ection of the correct types of breeding-stock and the care of the animal organism from the stage of fertilization of the ovum onwards. I shall, no doubt, be accused by some of join- ing those who delight in having a tilt at the young graduate, but that is not my intention. I feel that he has a good deal to complain of and in recent years I have noticed a distinct tendency on the part of veterinary students themselves to ask for a more imaginative course of professional training, which is a very healthy sign. In India, where veterinary education is at the moment much to the fore and new curri- cula are being devised, a- great opportunity presents itself, and it is to be hoped that those in authority will see that old traditions are no longer blindly followed and that, at least in the degree courses, the system of veterinary educa- tion introduced will provide the necessary basic training to enable a graduate to specialize in any branch of science pertaining to animals which he may select, and ensure his accept- ance on an equality with veterinary graduates of other countries in the administration of inter- national conventions and other measures designed for the improvement of animal health and animal production. ABSTRACTS Some new methods for studying intestinal amoebae and other protozoa. DOBELL, CLIFFORD (1942). Parasitology, 34, 101-12. IN this article the author has described the method of obtaining; (1) permanent preparations of intestinal amoebae from cultures, in natural attitudes, and (2) a new and simple method for staining amocbae and other protozoa. As a result, of his experience for the last 17 years, he has found that, if amoebae are desired to be fixed in their natural forms, the technique which he recommends is very useful. (Original article should be consulted for minute details). Briefly, the method consists of introducing aseptically thin cover glasses (No. 0, not exceeding 0.120 mm. in thickness and 7/8 in. square), which have been bisected some- what obliquely, into the culture medium prior to the inoculum is added. Such cover glasses can also be inserted in growing cultures of any required age. In the first instance, the inoculum is to be deposited at the bottom of the tube and on the upper surface of cover glass; in the second, the sediment at the bottom of the growing culture is to be sucked up by means of a sterile pipette and then re-distributed in the same manner. The culture tubes are to be incu- bated in a slanting position. Amoebae in such a culture tube creep on the surface of the cover glass and can be removed for study by means of a sterile platinum hook. In order to obtain a stained preparation of such a specimen, the cover glass showing numerous amoebae (film downwards) is dropped into the fixing solution contained in a hollow-ground glass block for a few minutes (5-10 minutes or longer if required). It is recommended that, after preliminary fixation, the cover glass should be turned to bring the film-side up and the surface squirted with the fixative in order to wash away a large number of bacteria, after which the cover glass may be dropped back into the fixative
148 ABSTRACTS for the desired period. The following staining methods have given him excellent results. (a) Tungstic haematoxylin method It consists of mordanting the film in a 2 per cent solution of phosphotungstic acid in distilled water for not less than 10 minutes. This period may be extend- ed to several hours. Shorter period is said to be adequate for amoebae while the longer are better for cysts or flagellates. The film is next thoroughly washed in distilled water and stained for 10 minutes or longer (15-30 minutes or even several hours) in 0.2 per cent solution of "ripened" haematoxylin. Cysts and flagellates require a longer time for staining. After staining, wash in distilled water and then transfer to tap-water where it may be kept for 15 to 30 minutes (the water may be changed 2 or 3 times). The film appears purple to the naked eye and is ready for dehydration with alcohol, and is ultimately mount- ed in balsam or damar in the usual way. (b) Molybdic haematoxylin method This method is exactly like the foregoing, except that a 2 per cent. solution of ammonium molybdate is employed as a mordant in place of phosphotungstic acid. The author has obtained equally good prepara- tions of Giardia, Entromonas, Embadomonas, etc., with both methods of staining. Advantages of these methods are that they are rapid and easy, and do not involve the process of differentiation under the micro- scope, as is customary with ordinary ironORIGINAL ARTICLES EXPERIMENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF ANTHRAX THROUGH FLIES By S. K. SEN and F. C. MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 6 April, 1944) (With Plate XII THE experiments described in this paper were carried out at Mukteswar (alt. 7,500 ft.) between May and October, 1941-43. The daily maximum temperature range during this period was 68&deg;-80&deg; F. in May-June, 64&deg;-72&deg;F. in July-September and 64&deg;-69&deg; F. in October. Goats were used as experi- mental animals, since they are cheaper and more susceptible than cattle to experimental inocula- tion. The anthrax culture used was highly virulent for goats and gave typical rough colonies on agar. The species of insects tested were Stomoxys calcitrans, Musca domestica, Calliphora erythrocephala and, in one instance, Sarcophaga sp. In the earlier experiments, Tabanids (mainly Tabanus orientis) were employed, but, as none of these hill species would readily bite in captivity, the experiments were discontinued shortly after their commencement, with a view to resuming them in the plains where several species of Tabanids with better biting propensities were known to occur. It is hoped to report later on some of these plains species. Although Tabanids are believed to be more commonly involved in the spread of anthrax [Mitzmain, 1914; Kehoe, 1917; Frey, 1919; Morris, 1920; Nieschulz, 1928,; Olsufev and Leler, 1935; Kraneveld and Djaenoedin, 1940], several workers have also incriminated S. Calcitrans as a transmitting agent. Thus, Mitzmain [1914] succeeded in transmitting anthrax from a guinea- pig to other guinea-pigs through the bites of S. calcitrans by the interrupted method of feeding, the flies being fed on the donor from 2½ hours to a few minutes before its death. Schuberg and Kuhn [cited by Schuberg and Böing, 1914] report having successfully transmitted anthrax to guinea- pigs and mice through S. calcitrans, while Schu- berg and Böing [1914], after failing with one goat, transmitted the disease to one out of three sheep through the same species of fly. They point out that biting flies may be a much more important factor in transmission in some lands, e.g. N. and S. America, than in others, e.g. Great Britain and Germany. Hetsch [1915] likewise considers S. calcitrans to be the 'most dangerous carrier of anthrax', being able to carry the infection for about two hours and over a distance of not less than 1¾ miles. Morris [1919], working with guinea-pigs, found S. calcitrans capable of trans- mitting anthrax mechanically from opened car- buncular swellings of animals suffering from anthrax. He considers the fly may sometimes play this role in nature. He [1918] also records having obtained positive results by using the allied species, Lyperosia (Haematobia) irritans. Flies of this species were fed for one minute on guinea- pigs, previously inoculated subcutaneously with anthrax spores, and then on healthy ones from one to three minutes, the feeding being done through wire-gauze fixed on the top of a wooden box in which the flies were confined. The greatest proportion of successful transmissions was obtain- ed when the infected animal was bitten a short time before its death. Also, an immediate trans- fer of flies from the infected to healthy animal appeared to be necessary for positive results. Morris refers to the bacilli carried on the proboscis of the fly producing, as a rule, the external or carbuncular form of anthrax. It is noteworthy that, according to him, the disease is not ' usually ' spread through the excreta of infected insects and that L. irritans. would not feed satisfactorily on anthra carcases. In contrast with the positive result obtained by Morris with L. irritans, Nieschulz [1928] records having failed to transmit anthrax through the bites of L. exigua. As regards M. domestica, this species has been shown by Morris [1919] to be capable of carrying anthrax bacilli from anthrax-infected flesh and so contaminating wounds on healthy guinea-pigs. Nieschulz [1928] used M. inferior and obtained positive results with guinea-pigs in one out of six experiments. The possibility of Calliphorids being concerned in the spread of anthrax has been mentioned by a number of workers. Dunn [1918] refers to the common phenomenon of swarms of screw-worm flies (Chrysomyia macellaria) being attracted to blood-stained exudation from the mouths and nostrils of anthrax carcases, and he, therefore, considers it probable that some of these flies would infect any animal they might visit shortly afterwards, provided it has some unhealed skin abrasion. Osins' kii [1938] refers to the habit of Lucilia and Sarcophaga of sucking fluids from carcases, e.g. of rabbits dead of anthrax. He describes experiments in which Calliphora and Lucilia flies were placed on agar, after they had sucked the juices from anthrax meat. In such cases, anthrax bacilli were found to be 149
150 Transmission of Anthrax through Flies deposited on the agar. Morris [1919, 1922] demonstrated the transference of anthrax bacilli from anthrax-infected flesh to wounds on healthy guinea-pigs through the agency of Calliphora erythrocephala and Lucilia spp. In the present experiments, the question of S. calcitrans being involved in the spread of anthrax is claimed to have been investigated in all its aspects, for these experiments not only included the feeding of infected flies on healthy goats, but also the testing of infectivity of faeces of such flies when deposited on the scarified or cauterized skin of goats. The experiments with M. domestica and C. erythrocephala were carried out to confirm the statements made by previous workers that these and allied species are capable of carrying the infection from anthrax-infected flesh to abrasions on the skin of healthy animals. A few experiments were also carried out to test the possibility of the disease being reproduced through contact of infected M. domestica with the eyes of healthy goats. As control to some of the experiments, a study was made of the effects of the direct application of anthrax spore culture to the normal intact skin of goats and also to skin treated in different ways. Two experiments were carried out to test the infectivity of C. erythrocephala bred from larvae fed on an anthrax meat. Specimens from flies used in some of the experi- ments were bacteriologically examined for the presence of anthrax bacilli in their mouth-parts or bodies or in both, and in a few instances faeces of Stomoxys flies were similarly examined at various intervals, after their feed on anthrax-infected goats. METHODS AND MATERIAL Entomological In the experiments with Tabanids, the latter were liberated in a fly-proof shed (Plate XII, figs. 1 and 2) measuring about 12 × 6½ feet and divided into two compartments, in one of which was kept the donor (anthrax-infected) goat and in the other the receptor (healthy) goat. The shed was covered with mosquito netting of 22 meshes to the linear inch and provided with double doors at both ends, in order effectively to prevent escape of the flies. In the middle of the shed, there was an adjustable door for admitting the flies, after their infective feed, from the ' infected ' to the 'healthy' compartment. In no instance, however, were any of the flies actually observed to feed on the experimental animals, though they were provided with all possible inducement to do so, including a plentiful supply of moisture and vegetation. It is noteworthy that Mitzmain [1913,2], in the Philippines, has recorded similar experience with Tabanids in his experiments on the transmission of surra. He observes: ' An effort was made to induce flies [Tabanus striatus] to feed on healthy and infected animals kept together in a large screened cage. The results were negative, the flies dying in a few days when kept within the enclosure'. In the present experiments, recourse was, therefore, eventually had to feeding the Tabanids in tubes, but, as already stated, their natural disinclination to feed in captivity caused these experiments to be discontinued. In experiments with S. calcitrans, M. domestica and Calliphora erythrocephala, three types of cages were used: (1) The usual type of cage consisting of a wooden frame and covered on all six sides with mosquito netting, with a hole and cotton sleeves on one side for the introduction of the arm; two sizes of this cage were used, one for holding about 60 and the other 200-300 flies. (2) The same type as above, but the whole of the mosquito netting on one side was replaced by a sliding metal door to enable the flies to be brought in contact with the body of the animal, without the intervention of the netting. This type of cage was used in the majority of the experiments with M. domestica and C. erythrocephala and will be referred to as the ' scarification cage. ' (3) Cone-shaped cage covered with mosquito netting and designed for bringing infected M. domestica in contact with eyes of healthy goats; it was open at both ends, the narrow end being provided with an adjustable shutter and adapted for being placed over the eye of the animal. This type of cage will be referred to as the ' eye cage '. Experiments with S. calcitrans were all con- ducted with wild specimens, and they were fed either singly in tubes or en masse in cages of the first type described above. The methods adopted for keeping the flies alive between feeds and for determining whether a particular fly has actually fed or not were essentially the same as those des- cribed by Sen and Abdus Salam [1937]. Specimens of M. domestica used in the experi- ments were collected from cattle sheds in the station, but in the case of C. erythrocephala, only laboratory-bred specimens were employed. Specimens of both these species were kept alive in cages by providing them with sugar solution to feed upon and enough moisture in the form of thick pads of cotton-wool saturated with water and placed on the top of the cages. Bacteriological In all cases where living donors were used the presence of anthrax bacilli in the peripheral cir- culation had already been demonstrated before feeding of the flies commenced. Usually a
S. K. SEN AND F. C. MINETT 151 separate cultural examination of the flies' heads and bodies was made, the heads having been removed immediately after the flies were killed. The wings were also removed. It was advan- tageous to ' clean ' the material in the following way: it was first well shaken up in ten changes of sterile distilled water, drained as much as pos- sible, immersed in absolute alcohol for five to ten minutes with occasional shaking, and dried on absorbent paper. The dried material was then powdered in a mortar and suspended in saline (2.5152 Transmission of Anthrax through Flies TABLE I Stomoxys calcitrans feeding on normal skin No. of living goats used as donor Date of death, Number of flies Duration of exposure (minutes) on Interval between exposures Result Remarks donor receptor 1941 116 July 25 1 P.M. 25 5 10 3 min.

In the earlier experiments, they were enclosed in cigarette tins or in ' scari- fication cages'. As neither of these proved satis- factory, use was later made of ' eye cages ' des- cribed earlier in this paper. All these results were negative, as might perhaps have been anticipated in view of the work of Aïtoff [1922]. As a further check, two goats were given on the conjunctiva a suspension of anthrax from an 18-hour agar culture, but no infection ensued. The suspension was held in contact with the cornea and conjunctiva of one eye for several minutes before the animal was released.
S. K. SEN AND F. C. MINETT 153 III. Experiments with Calliphora erythrocephala and Sarcophaga sp. 1. Bringing infected flies in contact with cau- terized skin. These experiments were carried out on the same lines as those with S. calcitrans (Table II). 2. Two experiments were carried out to test the infectivity of C. erythrocephala flies bred from larvae reared for about 8-14 days from time of emergence from egg on meat from anthrax car- cases. The flies were then brought into contact with the cauterized skin of goats, for 1½ hr. on each of two successive days in the first experiment and for l½ hr. on one day in the second experiment. The results were negative, and anthrax organisms could not be recovered on bacteriological examina- tion of the flies or of larvae which were about to pupate. Morris [1919] found that flies (Callophorid and Lucilia) bred out of unopened anthrax carcases during the warm season do not carry infection, but that flies bred in the presence of anthrax spores are capable of doing so. It is of interest also that Graham-Smith [1911] found that many blowflies (C. erythrocephala and Lucilia caesar) which emerged from larvae fed for seven days on meat infected with anthrax spores were infected with B. anthracis and remained infected for 15 days or more. The faeces deposited by such flies contained considerable numbers of B. anthracis for at least two days. On the other hand, flies which emerged from larvae fed on the body of a guinea-pig dead of anthrax, that is containing only spore-free forms of the organism, were not infected with anthrax [Graham-Smith, 1912].

Tuft [1931] studied the relative values of various forms of inoculation, with particular reference to the intracutaneous route in immunization against typhoid, and found that the rate of antibody pro- duction by the intracutaneous route was equal to that by the subcutaneous route and slightly better than by the intramuscular route, although the total dose of antigen inoculated by the former was one-seventh of the amount introduced by the last two methods. It was also contended that since the skin is richly supplied with reticulo-endothelial cells it may well be adapted for the liberation of the anti-bodies by the stimulus caused at the site of the intracutaneous inoculation. The experiments of Neufeld and Meyer [cited by Tuft 1931], and a number of other workers have revealed that the reticulo-endothelial system plays an important part in the process of immunity. Tuft [1931] also refers to the possibility of utilizing the skin in a specific manner for the introduction of antigens by other modified forms of inoculation. These consist of inunctions described as 'per- cutaneous method' by Petrushky et al. through scarification and subsequent inunction described as 'cutaneous-method' by Pondrof, the 'intracutaneous or sub-epidermal method' of Wolff Eisner and Sahli, and the 'cuti-vaccina- tion' of Besredka, [all references cited by Tuft (1931)]. These reports suggested the possibility of uti- lizing the skin for immunization against other infections. MATERIAL AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS The existing subcutaneous method of immuniz- ing against rinderpest was compared with the scari- fication method in an experimental group of ani- mals. The latter method consisted in bringing about an interaction between the host and the virus through multiple foci of irritation within a small area on the skin of the ear, and was a modification of the intracutaneous mode of inocu- lation, in that it enabled a relatively larger sur- face and the entire thickness of the skin to parti- cipate in the process of immunization. In this method, the implantation of the virus and scari- fication of the skin were accomplished simulta- neously and thus required no-subsequent inunction. The ear for this purpose offered certain advantages over other parts of the body. It was easier to manipulate, and the site where the antigen had to be implanted, possessed a degree of natural pro- tection against external influences. Being devoid of flesh and provided with thin tender skin, the ear was a favourable site for the points of the scari- fier to penetrate to their full depth into the tissues involved. Scarifier (Plate XIII, fig. 1). The proper length of the points of the scarifier was important. Ob- servations on some dead cattle revealed that the skin thickness on the inner side of the ear varied from 0.8 to 2 mm. Hence, in determining their length due allowance had to be made for such variations, not only in respect of animals of the same breed, but also in those of other breeds, to ensure that the points of the scarifier could pierce the entire thickness of the skin in all breeds, with- out being long enough to penetrate beyond the layers of the skin. Vaccine. Goats that had shown a positive reaction were destroyed on the fifth day after inoculation. The spleen was removed and freed from fat and fascia. The organ was then either squeezed in an iron press or ground in a mortar, distilled water being added to the pulp at the rate of 1 c.c. to each gramme, and then transferred to 1 c.c. collapsible tubes160 Immunization against Rinderpest by Scarification Method The calves were weaned at birth, and fed on milk obtained from immune dairy cows. Of these, 20 calves and the four hill bulls were inoculated by scarification, and the remaining five by the sub- cutaneous route, with one and the same brew of vaccine.

To prove that absence of reaction in vaccinated animals does not necessarily indicate failure to induce immunity, it would be necessary to vacci- nate and test a considerable number of animals. (Further experiments on an extensive scale are in progress). Some attempt towards this end in the case of rinderpest is provided by the experiments recorded in this paper. The results in the case of hill bulls indicate that by the present technique the method cannot be used safely in this breed, owing to their very high susceptibility. Hall [1934] found that the minimal amount of whole blood that could set up a (delayed) reaction in animals susceptible to rinderpest was 0.0002 c.c. It would be impossible to measure the amount of antigen absorbed from the scarified site, but considering the concentrated nature of the vaccine-pulp implanted and the minuteness of the dose of virus required to infect an animal, it may be presumed that the amount absorbed would exceed this limit. Some Russian authors [cited by Hutyra, Marek and Manninger, 1938] were inclined to believe that the natural-infection occurred as two distinct types, viz., exanthematous and non-exanthema- tous. Should this difference of virus type be established, it may be possible to adapt the exan- thematous strain to growth in dermis. In this case the use of such a virus, either alone or with the addition of a suitable tissue depressant, might cause the antigen to be fixed, resulting in local pustule formation and so rendering the host im- mune to both virus types. It may be admitted that infective agents like those of anthrax and small-pox, where vaccina- tion through intracutaneous route has given en- couraging results, may have had a special predi- lection for the skin. On the other hand, with infections like typhoid which are not known to possess any marked predilection, equally favour- able results were obtained by Tuft [1891]. This finding in the case of rinderpest, which some be- lieve to have a predilection for the epithelial tissues and also in a proportion of cases for the skin, should apply with a greater degree of cer- tainty where the antigen employed is a living virus capable of proliferation. It may also be added, as a fact of common knowledge, that local irritation of skin sites favours the proliferation of virus implanted thereon. The simplicity of the operation, the considerably smaller amount of apparatus and attendants needed, the case with which the method can be adopted, particularly during expeditions and war conditions, and the possibility of its being more readily acceptable to Indian stockowners, owing to its close resemblance to small-pox vaccination, with which they have been familiar for decades, would appear to be facts of importance. SUMMARY The possibility and manner of applying goat- adapted rinderpest virus by scarification is re- ported. Results obtained by the two routes of inoculation, viz., scarification and subcutaneous, are compared. The simplicity of the operation and other advantages accruing to the scarification method are pointed out. The chief points brought out by the experiment are: 1. The ease of performing the scarification me- thod and the smaller amount of apparatus and attendants required are considered to be its chief advantage over the subcutaneous method. 2. Results indicate that in most cases reactions following immunization by scarification are slight or absent. 3. Out of 19 animals tested at intervals up to a year, immunity was strong in 15, partial in three, and apparently absent in one. Of the five animals immunized subcutaneously, immunity was strong in four and partial in one. 4. Absence of reaction in the scarification method appeared to be without effect on the re- sulting immunity. 5. The scarification method by its present technique cannot be safely employed in hill cattle of Kumauni breed. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author is grat ful to Dr F. C. Minett, to Mr J. R.

POSSIBILITIES OF ADDING SESAME OIL TO HYDROGENATED FAT OR VANASPATI, TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM GHEE By ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, NOSHIR N. DASTUR and K. G. BHIDE, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 14 August, 1943) SEVERAL varieties of hydrogenated vegetable fats have been put on the market at present, which closely resemble ghee in almost all their physical characteristics. To distinguish ghee from such hydrogenated fats has therefore become a matter of great concern with the consumer. The problem is analogous to the problem of butter vs. margarine in Western countries. To facilitate the detection of adulteration of butter with margarine, it has been made compulsory in Austria, Belgium, Den- mark, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland to a 5 to 10 per cent of sesame oil to the latter. By this means margarine is easily dis- tinguished from butter by the well-known Bouda- nin or Villavecchia test. This investigation was therefore undertaken to explore the possibilities of adding sesame oil to hydrogenated fats to facilitate their detection when mixed with ghee. In the past whenever this subject received atten- tion from the authorities concerned, objections were raised to the adoption of such a precau- tionery measure by the manufacturers of hydrogenated fats on the ground that, as sesame oil had a relatively high iodine value, it was likely to lower their keeping quality. No data had, however, been obtained so far to prove if this was really so and to what extent the quality of hydro- genated fats was actually likely to be affected by the addition of sesame oil in different proportions. This and related aspects of the problem have there- fore been carefully determined by this investigation. EXPERIMENTAL (1) Effect of adding sesame oil on the keeping quality of hydrogenated fats. Two different com- mercial brands of hydrogenated fats, one made from groundnut oil (Brand A) and the other from cottonseed oil (Brand B) were used for these studies. Sesame oil, after being freed from any free acids and suspended matter, was mixed with these samples in the proportions of 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent. The samples were kept in glass bottles and exposed to diffused light. A sample of each of the two original brands was also kept under identical conditions as control. The keeping quality was measured in terms of peroxide value at intervals by the method described by Dastur and Lea [1940]. The results obtained are given in Tabes I and II. The peroxide values are expressed in terms of N/500 sodium thiosulphate.

It is well known that, if oilcakes are fed in large quantities to milch animals, the butterfat secreted by the animals takes up some of the characteristics of the oils. No data are, however, available on the effect of feeding sesame cakes to cattle and the res- ponse of the secreted milk fat to the Boudanin or Villavecchia reaction. If animals fed on sesame cake secrete fat that gave a positive test for sesame oil the utility of adding sesame oil to hydrogenated fats would be considerably diminished. To ascer- tain this point, feeding trials were carried out with two cows and two buffaloes. The animals were fed sesame cake varying from 2 lb. to 10 lb. per head, per day, over a period of ten weeks. The butter fat was collected from individual animals twice a week and tested for the Reichert-Meissel value, iodine value, refractive index and Villavecchia test. The last-named reaction was carried out by the method given by the A. O. A. C. [1940]. The fat used for these tests was extracted at low tempera- ture by centrifuging the butter heated to 50° C. At no time was it possible to get even a faint indi- cation of the presence of sesame oil by the Villa- vecchia reaction throughout the experimental period. During this period the Reichert-Meissel value, iodine value and refractive index showed considerable change. These results therefore showed that the compounds which give the Villa- vecchia reaction are not secreted along with the butterfat. DISCUSSION From the results of peroxide values given in Tables I and II, it can be seen that, after an induc- tion period of about four weeks, the peroxide values of all the samples increased at an accelerated rate. The results for the experimental period of seven months showed that the addition of sesame oil did lower the keeping quality of hydrogenated fat to some extent after a time. When 5-10 per cent of sesame oil was used, there was an increase in peroxide value above the control samples, to the extent of about 25 per cent. It must, however, be added that considering the facts that the fats which were dealt with were of vegetable origin and that for these experiments the samples were stored in glass containers, the difference in their peroxide values cannot be considered to be objec- tionable or excessive for all practical purposes from the point of view of the trade. With higher con. centrations of sesame oil than those studied, the increase in the peroxide value was very marked. There was hardly any difference in the iodine and acid values of control hydrogenated fat samples and those containing sesame oil tested after keeping for seven months (Tables III and IV). TABLE IV Acid value (per cent oleic) of hydrogenated fat and sesame oil mixtures Date Fat A Sesame oil Fat B Sesame oil 5 per cent 10 per cent 15 per cent 20 per cent 5 per cent 10 per cent 15 per cent 20 per cent Original . . . . 0.09 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.08 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 After 2 months . . . . 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.09 0.10 0.11 0.10 0.11 0.07 S. H. QURASHI 165 On keeping fats containing sesame oil, the inten- sity of Villavecchia reaction tended to diminish. In spite of this, it was possible to detect the presence of sesame oil in ghee adulterated with 1 per cent of hydrogenated fats containing 5 per cent sesame oil and stored for seven months. Hence this decrease in colour-giving property of hydrogenated fats containing sesame cannot be a disadvantage. Butterfat obtained by feeding excessive amounts of sesame cake (average crude fat = 14 per cent) did not give the Villavecchia reaction, though there was a considerable alteration in other chemi- cal characteristics of such butterfat. Hence a positive test for sesame oil in ghee can safely be relied upon to indicate the presence of hydroge- nated fats containing sesame oil. It is very likely that different samples of sesame oil would give varying colour intensity in the Villa- vecchia reaction. Also, if sesame oil, previous to its being added to vanaspati, is heated to high temperatures (above 225° C.), it may loose the pro- perty of giving a positive Villavecchia test. Fur- ther, by filtering sesame oil through different absorbing media, like charcoal, Kiesulguhr etc., similar effects may be produced [cf. Gravendort, 1924]. To overcome these defects, if the idea of adding sesame oil to hydrogenated fats is ever put into practice, the best recourse would be to specify that when ten grams of fat are tested by the stand- and Villavecchia test, a colour intensity of say at least 15 red units should be produced. This would require an addition of only 5-7 per cent of sesame oil to hydrogenated fats; and under these circumstances, as shown before, the keeping quality, flavour, etc. of these products would hardly be affected. Addition of 1 per cent of such fats to ghee can be detected without any difficulty with improved Villavecchia reaction [Dastur, et al166 Trichuris Vulpis in Dogs in India number of testes (12) reported has not been seen even in one single specimen obtained by the writer. The differences noted above, although fairly important, do not, however, justify the creation of a new species and may prove to be indivi- dual variations. In view of these observations, it may be considered advisable for the present to amend the specific diagnosis of Amoebotae- nia sphenoides as follows: Specific diagnosis of Amoebotaenia sphenoides Railliet 1892 emended Diagnosis. Amoebotaenia with a length up to 4 mm.; number of proglottides up to 30. Testes less than 12 or 12, running along the posterior margin of the proglottides. Uterus persistent, lobed posteriorly.

A search for lesions in the mucosa of the caecum did not reveal any well-pronounced or clear- cut lesions, except a few scattered petechiae and at places an ill-defined and superficial erosion, but it was found to be coated with a fair amount of mucus and gave an impression of being some- what thicker than normal. DISCUSSION As stated above, Srivastava considered that T. vulpis infestation was widespread in India from the fact that the material examined by him came from about three different and distant localities. The experience of the present writers who have examin- ed several hundreds of faecal specimens from dogs in Calcutta and have conducted post-mortem exa- mination on a large number of dog carcases, and those of other workers who have from time to time reported on the parasitic fauna of Indian dogs, has been against such an assumption. It may be recalled that the pup reported upon in this paper was an imported dog, and it is evident from the available history that the infestation took place before the pup arrived in India. Unfortunately, Srivastava does not state whether the dogs were imported or indigenous. It seems very likely that his material also originated from imported dogs. It does seem surprising that Trichuris vulpis has not yet become an established parasite of the indigenous dog, in spite of the fact that for many years large numbers of dogs have been im- ported into the country from different parts of the world, including those places where Trichuris vulpis is known to occur.

The appropriate method to assess the improvement would be to compare in successive progenies, the total milk yield during lactation in relation to the length of lactation and the length of kidding inter- val. In other words, we have to compare the per- formance for total milk yield by standardizing, as it were, the length of lactation and kidding interval. This is done by comparing the values for (1) average milk yield per day of lactation and (2) average milk yield per day of kidding interval. Table VI gives the set of comparisons between the performances of the foundation stock and the first progeny. Columns (2) and (7) of the table show the number of goats in the two generations whose records have been compared. Columns (3) and (8) give the number of lactations to which the average performances shown in the other columns refer. Columns (4), (5), (6), (9) and (10) give the average values with their standard errors of the total yield during lactation, the length of lactation in days, the average daily milk yield during lacta- tion, the kidding interval, and the average daily milk yield during the kidding interval respectively. It will be seen that while there is a slight decrease in the length of lactation (from 176.7 to 176.1 days) and the kidding interval (from 312.5 to 291.4 days) the first progeny has given a higher total milk yield as also a higher average daily milk yield during the lactation and the kidding interval. But this comparison without reference to the errors of the averages compared is by itself inadequate to sup- port the conclusion regarding the superiority of the first progeny over their mothers. For the averages which have been compared are themselves variable in the sense that different values for the performances would have been obtained had there been different numbers of goats in the two genera- tions. Before we conclude that the first progeny is superior to their mothers, it is therefore necessary to satisfy ourselves that the difference observed between the performances of the two generations is larger than the possible difference arising from variability of the averages. This variability of the averages is measured by what is called the standard error and the statistical method to judge whether the difference observed is due to chance causes is known as the t test of significance. When the difference observed cannot be explained on the grounds of chance, i.e., it is larger than can be expected on chance causes alone, the difference is said to be statistically significant. The values for the standard error have been shown below the respective averages and the values of t are shown in the last line of the table. Whenever the observed difference is found to be significant, the fact is indicated by asterisks against the corresponding values of t. It will be seen from the table that there is no significant difference between the length of lacta- tion and kidding interval of the two generations but that the first progeny has given a statistically superior performance over their dams in respect of all the other three characters. This may be due to several factors: (1) the sires may have had a real transmitting ability, (2) the better feeding and herd management right from the birth of the first progeny in contrast with the environment in which the dams were reared may also be partly responsible, (3) the existence of hybrid vigour which is frequently observed in the progeny of unrelated animals may also partly offer an, explana- tion, or (4) there may have been a seasonal effect arising from the different climatic and disease con- ditions in the different years in which the dams and their daughters had their respective lactations. The better feeding and management at the farm is expected to have a beneficial effect on the perfor- mance of the first progeny but it is obviously impossible to isolate for study the effect of this factor. We have, however, gone into considerable detail in regard to factors (1) and (4). Table VII shows the sirewise comparison of the first progeny and their mothers.

The performances of the first progeny sired by bucks 49M and 50M were not significant. The significance of the difference in the climatic conditions can be best appreciated from Table VIII, showing the distribution of lacta- tions of the foundation stock and the first progeny in the different years. Each year has been divided in this table according as the lactations followed the summer or the winter kidding. It will be seen from this table that in the case of foundation stock the majority of the lactations were completed before 1934 summer while in the case of the first progeny the majority of the lactations were com- pleted during the period from 1934-38. It will also be seen that there is relatively a larger number of winter kiddings in the first progeny than in the foundation stock. Hence the difference in the per- formance of the foundation stock and of the first progeny may be to a certain extent attributed to the difference in the two periods and to the unequal numbers of winter and summer kiddings in the two progenies. As, however, we do not know how and which of the climatic factors influence the milk yield, it is hardly possible to make any allow- ance for the seasonal effect. The best we can do is to compare the lactations of the two groups falling in common years, although even here the first pro- geny will have an advantage over their mothers in so far as it will constitute a comparison between the TABLEV III Distribution of lactations 48M 49M Dams Daugh- ters Dams Daugh- ters 1931 W. 5 .. 2 .. 1932 S . 3 .. 2 ..

The results of these compari- sons are shown in Table IX, for bucks 48M and 49M. Buck 50M does not provide sufficient material for such a comparison. It will be seen that the first progeny of sire 48M gives a signifi- cantly larger total milk yield per lactation. When, however, the total milk yield is corrected for the length of lactation and the kidding interval, the difference disappears. The progeny of sire 49M does not show a significant difference in any of these characters. Table IX-A shows the results of the separation of the common year lactation com- parison for the progeny of buck 48M into summer and winter kiddings. It will be seen from the table TABLE IX-A Separation of the common year lactation comparison for the progeny of buck 48M into summer and winter seasons No. of lacta- tions Total milk yield oz.

As the differences are very large, the values of t have not been given. The preponderance of winter lactations in the common period in the first progeny observed in Table VIII thus at once partly explains their superiority over the foundation mothers. We may, therefore, conclude that while breeding may have had an effect, the better performance of the first progeny might also to an extent be due to better feeding and management at the farm, to differences in the years in which the majority of the lactations of the foundation stock and the first progeny were completed and to the preponderance of winter kiddings in the first progeny. While bucks No. 48M and 49M are by themselves not proved it is of some interest to compare their relative worths as transmitters of milk yield. This is done in the last row of Table VII giving the values of t for the comparison of the transmitting abilities of the two bucks, transmitting ability being measured by the difference in the perfor- mances of the progeny and their mothers. It will be seen that these comparisons are free from consideration of the order of lactation or seasonal effects. The table shows that none of the three values of t is significant, though the value of t for total milk yield is high and approaching the 5 per cent level of significance. While, therefore, there is a slight suggestion that buck 48M is pro- bably superior to 49M, there is no adequate evidence to establish his superior worth.
172 Breeding Experiment with Goats We shall now consider the results of the compa- rison of the second progeny with their mothers in the first progeny. These are given in Table X. Unlike Table VI, where a collective comparison over all lactations has been made owing to lack of information regarding the order of lactations of the foundation stock, the comparison in this table is made for corresponding lactations. It will be seen that far from showing an improvement the results indicate significant deterioration in all the lactations. The material is too scanty to allow examination of seasonal effect in the way we did in Tables VIII and IX. While season may have had an effect one way or the other, the data leave little doubt in our mind that the bucks had little worth as transmitters of milk yield.

As little reliance can be placed on the progeny tests involving less than five compa- risons, these are not made. It will be seen that the progeny of 152M does not show a significantly different performance from that of their mothers but that the progeny of 633M suggests a significant deterioration. The comparison of the relative worths of the two sires, however, made in the last row of the table does not suggest that 633M was a distinctly inferior buck to 152M. The results of the comparison of the third pro- geny with their dams in the second progeny are given in Table XII. It will be seen that while there is some increase in the total milk yield, there is a significant reduction in the average milk yield per day of lactation and a considerable though non-significant reduction in the average milk yield per day of kidding interval. This corroborates to a great extent the findings of Table X. The comparisons so far made are those between the successive progenies and their mothers, and although appropriate from the view-point of test- ing the success of breeding policy do not give us a complete picture of the improvement in the perfor- mance of the herd as a whole in successive genera- tions. This is done in Tables XIIIA and XIIIB, which give the performance over all lactations of the foundation stock, of the first progeny and lacta- tionwise performance of the first, second and third progenies. It will be seen that while the first pro- geny shows a better performance over the founda- tion stock, there is a steady deterioration in the per- formance thereafter.

The consideration of this question has been made possible because no culling out of the female progeny was practised as a part of the policy of breeding followed on the farm. The whole of the progeny was kept and bred up. For this pur- pose, the 19 mothers of the foundation stock were ranked in order of their performances in respect of the three characters over all lactations. The results of the comparison of the performances of the progeny of the first half compared with that of the rest are given in Table XIV. It will be seen that while the performance of the second group of 10 dams is significantly different from that of the first group of nine dams, their progenies do not TABLE XIV Effect of selection in the foundation stock Character compared Foundation stock dams First progeny daughters Number of goats Number of lactations Value oz.

176 Breeding Experiment with Goats comparison made with regard to the first and the second progeny, shown in Table XV, gives the same result. Both the tables show that selective breed- ing on the side of the dams is without effect and suggest that there is possibly no correlation bet- ween the performances of the dams and the daugh- ters. This is actually found to be the case as will be seen from the values of the coefficient of corre- lation shown in Table XVI. Six of the nine values of the coefficient of correlation are negative and the remaining three are positive but all of them are small and non-significant indicating no real asso- ciation between the performances of the dams and their daughters.

GOVINDA RAU, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 6 September 1943) RHODODENDRON ARBOREUM grows abundantly in the Kumaun, Kashmir and Khasia hills between 4,000 and 11,000 ft. In January and February, when owing to frost and snow green herbage was scanty, a large number of animals, which had to subsist on hill-grazing, showed mild symptoms of intoxication and bulging eyes. Observations, extending over several days, indicated that these animals had to depend for nourishment to some extent on dry autumn-shed rhododendron leaves. Believing the condition described above to be possibly due to the ingestion of these leaves, a systematic feeding experiment was conducted on two bulls, two sheep and two goats. These animals were of mature age and apparently in good health. Leaves and flowers, including buds, were fed to the animals. The amounts given on different days are shown in Table I.

After ingesting voluntarily about 14 lb. of the plant in two days, the following symptoms were observed: Forthy salivation, vomitting, dullness, a stag- gering unsteady gait when forced to walk, crossing of the hind limbs, grinding of the teeth, bulging of the eye-balls and a disinclination for food. No febrile disturbance was noticed throughout the experiment. After two days of abstinence, there was progressive abatement of the symptoms. Sheep and goats. After consuming about 6 lb. of the plant, symptoms of frothy salivation, vomitting and grinding of teeth were observed. TOXICITY AND ACTIVE PRINCIPLE The tender leaves and the honey of rhododen- dron flowers are considered to be toxic [Kirtikar and Basu, 1933]. R. californicum and R. 177
178 Melanomata in Domesticated Animals maximum are reported to be fatally toxic in Oregon and the Alleghany mountains respective- ly [Lander, 1928]. The leaves contain a tanning resolvable by acids to yellowish-red rhodoxan- thine. A reddish colour is obtained by treating the juice of the leaves with a mineral acid. The chemical nature of the toxic principle and its mode of operation are not yet understood. A cow dead of rhododendron poisoning showed reddish tint in milk [Eve, 1907]. TREATMENT Half the ailing animals were given an oleagi- nous purgative followed by gastric stimulants, such as nux vomica, gentian and ginger for three days. The treatment scarcely was neces- sary, as the untreated animals also recovered in much the same time, once further ingestion of the plant was stopped. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS As can be seen from the table, after two days' feeding all the animals evinced a disinclination for any more of the plant, though given nothing else to eat. Therefore for five days each animal was drenched with about 26 lb. of pulverized leaf and flower suspension in water. No symp- toms of toxicity were manifested. Since it was possible that the bulls had developed a tolerance to this feed and also that there had been a change in the amount of the toxic principle in the five days' sample, the sample from the first- day locality was again utilized. After about 8 lb. of the plant were consumed by the same bulls in two days, all the symptoms of toxicity were freshly manifested. Two fresh bulls were fed over four days about 35 lb. of the second sample with no untoward symptoms, but, when the first sample was fed to them as also to the bulls of the other group, and when only as little as 6-8 lb. were consumed in two days, all the symptoms appeared as markedly as before. Thus we were led to conclude that it was not a question of tolerance but of the difference in composition of the two samples that had caused the failure to produce the symptoms of toxi- city even when the animals were drenched. It is well known that climate, soil, season and the stage of growth affect the toxicity of a plant [Steyn, 1934]. In this case all things being almost equal, only the soil condition and the degree of transmission of toxicity to the progeny come into prominence, for the two localities were fairly distant. This finding seems to be in agreement with that of Steyn [1932] and Couch [1932]. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Two samples of rhododendron arboreum from two different localities were used in feeding ex- periments on bulls, sheep and goats. Of these one sample was definitely toxic and the other was not. Soil condition is incriminated in the loss of toxicity of the second sample. The plant is not lethally toxic. REFERENCES Couch. J.

In verterinary pathology the subject becomes more complicated on account of the unique predisposition of grey horses to melano- matosis180 Melanomata in Domesticated Animals decreasing, particularly after middle age, so that much melanin remains unutilized. Under the circumstances, according to van Dorssen [1930], the cells containing and manufacturing melanin undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia, the pro- cess ending up as an uncontrolled multiplication of cells as in neoplasms. The frequency with which primary melanomata arise near the root of the tail is explained by M'Fadyean [1933] as possibly due to decline in demand for melanin in the long hairs of the tail. Whatever the cause may be, the fact remains that the grey horse is singularly predisposed to melanomatosis. There is no such parallel in tumours of man or of animals, even grey, except apparently in the case of the grey mule and the white goat [Jackson, 1936]* This predisposition must be inherited, as certain records suggest (Virchow), [cited by Ewing 1934, and Feldman 1932] and according to M'Fadyean may have originated as a mutation. The most common sites for primary melanomata in the horse are the preineum and the ventral sur- face of the tail (Plate XIV). As a rule, the tumours are, in these situations, not single but multiple. Less commonly, melanomata, apparently primary, may occur elsewhere on the skin, e.g. on the head, neck, scrotum, udder, sheath and limbs, and per- haps in some cases in the deeper tissues and in- ternal organs. One of the specimens in our col- lection was recorded from beneath the tongue. The tumours are not always malignant; however, in sone equine cases, under the influence of some unknown factor or factors, a benign growth may suddenly assume malignant characters and metastasize widely and rapidly, via the lympha- tics, and later on, perhaps also via the blood, infiltrating the regional lymph glands, serous membranes and internal organs, even including the brain, nerves, blood vessels, bones and heart; somewhat rapid cachexia follows, causing death or rendering destruction more economical. Several workers consider every melanoma as a potentially malignant tumour and, in medical pathology, every pigmented mole, naevus or wart as a potential source of melanoma. The tumours are more or less pigmented. The pigment may vary in different tumours, or in different parts of the same tumour, or within a group of metastatic growths. The cells of deeply pigmented tumours are usually large in size and may occasionally assume, by fusion or independent nucleus division, the appearance of giant-cells. The nucleus is small pale, more or less oval and usually excentrically situated; altogether, the picture suggests that the nucleus has undergone hypochromatosis and has been displaced by an excessive accumulation of melanin. The aggregation of pigment must obviously be responsible for the large size of the cell. In extremely pigmented tumours, the cells, in depigmented sections (Plate XV, fig. 1), resemble some what the cells of sebaceous glands and appear to have lost their staining affinities and perhaps their normal function. These points are brought home at once if one compares the picture presented by melanoblasts of a malignant growth (vide infra). Excess of pigment must naturally escape outside the tumour cells to be taken up by phago- cytes, or deposited in the surrounding connective tissue. Different from the above picture is that of a malignant melanoma. The cells are smaller, often not so deeply pigmented, or at places even unpigmented. The nucleus and cytoplasm retain their normal staining properties. The difference between these cells and those described above appears essentially to be one of physiological differentiation, the cells of the malignant melanoma exhibiting the tendency towards multiplication rather than towards pigment-formation. Mitotic figures are, therefore, easily seen (Plate XV, fig. 2). The cells tend to be rounded, polyhedral or spindle- shaped and may or may not show an alveolar arrangement. It should be borne in mind, however, that it is difficult to assess the degree of pigmentation either by the naked eye or microscopically and that tumours described as deeply pigmented may pos- sess malignant propensities. Thus, malignancy de- pends not on the amount of pigment but on the presence of a fair proportion of proliferative rather than melanin-producing melanoblasts. It is reasonable to suppose that this proportion bears a direct relationship to the degree of malignancy. Local connective tissue response appears to be relatively delayed in melanomata and a true stroma may be absent, at least in the early stage of the growth. Deeply pigmented, clinically benign tumours of the skin contain at first much of the local connective tissue. Histologically, such tumours only show accumulations of melano- blasts lying in the meshes of a connective tissue network. The pigmented areas, having at first a diffuse border, gradually become well separated from the surrounding tissue as a rounded focus, the adjacent tissue more or less stimulating a capsule. In the case of malignant tumours, signs of inva- sion of the surrounding tissue (Plate XV, fig. 3) and of metastasis can be observed without much difficulty also; in such tumours the connective *One may, however, note that MacCallum [1932] dis- covered ten melanomata, all in white men, in 12,000 autopsices wherein the proportion of Negroes was high. Ewing [1934] feels that the rare incidence of the tumour in Negroes may be due to difficulty in diagnosis.

M. Y. MANGRULKAR 181 tissue of the affected site reveals an early reaction sufficient to be recognized as a true stroma. Microscopically, the stages between the benign and malignant melanomata can often be seen. Suitable material will also illustrate the possibility that under unknown circumstances a benign- looking neoplasm may assume malignant charac- ters. Both types of melanoblast may co-exist in the same microscopic field or in different parts of the same section, suggesting a proliferative tendency supervening on the essentially primary function of pigment-production. The tumours may attain large dimension and vary in consistency from fluid or pulpy to hard; accordingly, on incision, the amount and nature of the escaping pigment varies. Portions of melanotic tumours kept in commonly used fixatives often impart the melanin tinge to the preservative. Superficial tumours are likely to ulcerate and discharge a dark-pigmented, foul- smelling fluid (79/1934). Rarely, the formation of the pigment may be so excessive that it may appear in the blood stream (melanaemia) in the urine (melanuria) or in various other situations (melanosis). The primary or metastic tumours in the serous cavities may be responsible for the presence in these cavities of pigmented fluid, some- times amounting to several gallons. In the horse, the cutaneous tumours are nodular, plain or elevated, occasionally pedun- culated growths covered with skin. The tumours in the internal organs are generally looked upon as metastases of a known or undetected primary skin-tumour. According to some [Ewing, 1934], primary melanomata, especially in man, may grow in these situations, owing to the misplace- ment of melanoblasts during development. It should not be understood that horses other than grey are immune from melanomatosis, for veterinarians do occasionally encounter such cases. Few cases of melanomata in mules have been recorded. In the collection at this Insti- tute, there is material from five cases, but gene- ralization is not possible on the strength of such meagre data. Of the five, four were accompanied by details regarding colour and age; three were from grey aged 8, 15 and 18 years, the fourth being from a 10 year-old brown animal. All four speci- mens were malignant tumours, which fact is in conformity with the observations of other workers [Aubry, cited by Feldman, 1932; Mathews, 1929; Frank and Morrill, 1937]. Unlike what occurs in the horse, the perineum and tail in mules do not seem to be the common sites of primary melanomata. The tumours in our collection affected the deeper tissues of the shoulder and thigh region, the organs and wall of the thorax and the abdomen, and in one case the mammary gland. It would appear that, whereas in the horse the apparently benign and superficial tumours are the first to attract attention, in mules early malignancy with the involvement of the internal organs is frequent. Indeed, in these animals, numerous metastatic growth may be discovered in the internal organs at autopsy, and the primary growth may have escaped detection during life. In one of the cases in our collection (1116/1927), it was suspected that a kick had been responsible for provoking a primary tumour in the sheath, discovered and interpreted as such on autopsy, to malignancy and internal metastasis, causing death within three months. The three specimens of bovine melanomata in our collection came from the skin of the chest, scrotum and pastern and were clinically benign and operable. In one of them (958/1926), the skin showed the evidence of filariasis (Plate XV, fig. 4), but what relation, if any, this had with the presence of the melanoma is open to conjecture. The tumours were nodular, hard and more or less deeply pigmented masses. One of them was peduncu- lated. There seems to be no age or colour pre- disposition to melanomatosis in bovines, although Imminger [cit. Feldman, 1932] has observed the occurrence of melanotic tumours more frequently in albino than in dark cattle. Malignant mela- nomata are rarely found in bovines, (vide specimen No. 115/1938, Addendum). Unlike melanomata, melanosis, i.e. mere dark brown or black pigmentation of the tissues or organs with- out any material dysfunction of the parts or of the organ, is relatively more common in cattle. In calves, melanosis of the cutis (melanosis maculosa) is seen; this, unlike the congenital naevi of man, tends to disappear with age (Feldman, 1932]. Although not represented in our collection, melanomata also occur in animals other than equines and bovines. In swine, apart from patchy benign melanosis of the skin, the occurrence of melanomata, often malignant with widespread metastases, has been noted, the primary lesion appearing usually in or under the skin, not infrequently when the animal is only a few weeks old. It is suspected that in certain breeds here- dity plays a part [Caylor and Schlotthauer, 1926]. The tumours in adult swine are usually benign. The dog, like the pig, is also subject to melano- matosis as well as simple melanosis. According to Gray [1900] certain breeds of dog, particularly the Yorkshire terrier, are predisposed to the for- mer, the tumours being of the nature of cutaneous elevations, or of single, stalked or sessile smooth
182 Melanomata in Domesticated Animals warts growing usually on the sides of the trunk or on the feet or prepuce. Recorded cases show that severe generalized melanomatosis occasional- ly occurs in the dog, involving the skin and in- ternal organs, but at times excluding the liver. Rarely, the central nervous system may also be involved [Feldman, 1932]. Melanosis is seen in the subcutis, lungs, liver, kidneys, etc., the pig- ment being present in the tissue spaces or in phagocytes. Whether melanosis in the pig and dog is capable of stimulating the growth of melanomata is not clear, but such a possibility would appear to exist. Jackson's cases [1936]M. Y. MANGRULKAR 183 arrived at by different authors would be difficult to reconcile. From the standpoint of histology, melanoblast are suggested to be ' highly differentiated connect- tive tissue cells which arise early in the ontogenic development from mesenchymal cells' [Maximow and Bloom, 1935]. Two types of melanoblast are recognized in the skin, distinct from the dermal melanophores which are situated in the superfi- cial layers of the dermis, in large numbers at places (e.g. around the anus), and which contain coarse uneven pigment-granules not formed by them, but perhaps received from the epidermis [Post, 1894; Ewing, 1934]. Of the true melanoblasts, elaborating and containing small and uniform pigment granules and giving a positive 'dopa' reaction, one set consists of branched cells184 Melanomata in Domesticated Animals ' tolerance of the tissues towards the melanin-forming cells' of melanoma as a point perhaps in favour of a mesoblastic origin of the tumour. At the same time it appears certain that in dealing with melanomata in man, the elabo- ration of pigment by epiblastic elements must also be considered [Ewing, 1934]. It is suggested [Ewing, 1934; Maximow and Bloom, 1935] that the pigment-forming cell arises very early in the formation of the mesenchyme and exhibits specific properties, some of which resemble those of epithelium, and that this would explain the tendency of some melanomata, the so-called melanocarcinomata, to manifest an epitheliomatous histology. Ribbert [1897] and others are inclined to attribute all naevi and melanomata to aberrations of the mesoblastic melanoblast. According to this view, the pig- ment in the epidermis is derived from the dermal melanoblast (mesodermal chromatophore) and the formation of naevi and cutaneous moles would follow excessive deposition of the pigment in the skin, leading to proliferation of epidermal cells with pigment formation [Ewing, 1934]. Summing up the contention between the epi and mesodermal origin of the chromatophore, Ewing says 'the histological data appear to me strongly, but not decisively, in favour of the epithelial origin, while the theoretical considerations are all against the epithelial theory'. The suggestions of some earlier authors [Demi- eville, 1880; Ziegler, 1908; Jaeger, 1911] regarding the endothelial and perithelial origin of naevus cells has found little support. Recklinghausen [1882] and subsequently others, have produced strong evidence to support the contention that pigmented naevi and neurofib- romatosis are related conditions. Nerve fibrills have been detected in groups of naevus cells by Soldan [1899], and by Masson[1926] who has shown that naevi and melanomata arise from cells of the end-apparatus of cutaneous sensory nerves (Meissner's and Merkel's corpuscles) and that the two should be considered as disorders of the nervous system. The cells actually proliferate in the neoplastic process, but their origin is not definitely known. Masson's findings are expressed in the following quotation from Ewing [1934]. 'In the derma, the naevus cells come from the cells of Meissner's corpuscles, in the epidermis, they come from the cells of Merkel-Ranvier, and from the chromatophores, in both situations. Masson does not attempt to decide whether the cells involved are mesodermal, glial, or epidermal Whereas in the opinion of certain authors, the evidence favours the epithelial origin of the melanoblast [MacCallum, 1932], others, not with- out reservation, consider this cell to be of meso- blastic origin [Beattie and Dickson, 1926]. But the view, in keeping with our present knowledge, should be the one expressed by Ewing [1934] Pigmented cells from melanotic sarcoma have been shown to reveal in tissue cultures [Grand, Chambers and Cameron, 1935] characters con- sistent with a mesenchymal origin. But this by no means precludes the possibility, not yet exhaustively investigated, that cells taken from melanotic carcinoma will reveal epithelial characters in tissue cultures. It may be stated here that Caylor and Schlotthauer [1926] were unsuccessful in their attempt to transplant porcine melanotic epitheliomata. The position with regard to equine melanoma- tosis is far from satisfactory. The work of van Dorssen [1903] on the histology of equine skin shows that, in coloured horses of all ages, the epi- dermis is pigmented and the cutis devoid of pigment-cells, but that in aged grey horses, the opposite is the case. Unfortunately, information on the situation of pigment in the skin of grey foals is not available for comparison. Van Dors- sen suggested that the pigment is conveyed to the epidermis by dermal (i.e. mesoblastic) melano- blasts and that in aged grey horses the demand for pigment is so much diminished that it accumulates in the cutis and, following the upset in pigment- metabolism, the growth of melanomata results (as mentioned earlier). On the contrary Schwalbe [1893] found nothing to indicate the transport of pigment from cutis to epidermis. Virchow- views the frequency of the tumour in grey horses as an evidence of congenital dyscrasia, although why this should be so particularly in the grey horse is not explained. Whatever the origin of the melanoblast, the question still remains. What is it that transforms it into a neoplastic cell? The history of contu- sion in one of our equine melanomata (1116/1927) and the discovery of filariasis in a bovine tumour (958/1926) may, however, have interest in view of the statement of Kettle [1925] that in three of his cases in man a history of previous injury by a rusty nail was associated with the development of melanoma on the foot, in the absence of a pre-existing mole. Yet, one finds it difficult to explain the notorious susceptibility of aged grey horses to melanomatosis on the theory of chronic 'local' irritation, of toxaemia* or of microparasitic invasion, for these factors must operate equally in *Since writing, a paper has appeared by Hadwen [1937] wherein he mentions that he has succeeded in producing growth of black hair around needle-punctures in rabbits inoculated with diptheria toxin. He suggests that injuries such as saddle-galls and insect-bites may induce a de or hyper-pigmentation of the skin.
J. CARMICHAEL 185 horses other than grey. Apart from possible 'racial' causes, hinted at by Virchow as 'con- genital dyscrasia' and by M'Fadyean [1933] as 'predisposition by mutation', there exists another suggestion: Post [1894] incriminated injurious substances produced locally by melanotic cells for provoking a neoplastic response on the part of these cells. Eppinger [1910] regards 'the excess of pigment and its products, especially indol and skatol, as the cause of overgrowth of the cells'. SUMMARY 1. An account is given of specimens of melano- mata of domesticated animals accumulated in this Institute. Their general histological structure is indicated and, where available, the clinical records and autopsy findings have been added. 2. No attempt is made to elucidate the problem of histogenesis of these tumours but only a general review of the available literature is given. REFERENCES Aeby, C. (1885). Cit. M'Fadyean (1933) Arey, L.

Paul Hoeber, New York 186 Bovine Tuberculosis The environmental conditions appertaining to cattle husbandry in the tropics as compared with colder climates has on occasions been brought forward to explain these circumstances [Hornby, 1934], but, as pointed out earlier, this cannot be accepted as the true explanation. The tubercle bacillus as found in Zebu cattle has been said to be of lower virulence than normal [Sheather, 1921], but when the literature is dis- cussed it will be seen that there is little evidence to support this contention, whilst in Uganda numerous bovine strains have been isolated from infected cattle and all have proved to be of standard virulence. Lastly the question of race resistance has been investigated and it appears it is here where the true explanation lies. Experimental evidence points to the fact that Zebu cattle possess a considerably greater resistance to tubercular infection than those of European breeds in so far as standard European strains of the tubercle bacillus are concerned. LITERATURE Liston and Soparkar [1917], referred to in part I of this paper, concluded as the result of their experiment that the comparative infrequency of the disease among cattle in India is due to natural resistance rather than to any method of housing or keeping cattle in. India as compared with England. They also point out that whereas a dose of 50 mg. of a culture of tubercle bacillus when injected into English calves invariably causes severe generalized tuberculosis, this does not apply to Indian calves, where there appears to be a much greater individual variation in resistance. Sheather [1921] carried out inoculation experi- ments on buffalo and cow calves, using a local strain of tubercle bacilli isolated from a tubercu- lous bovine. Five buffalo calves received 10 mg. of culture subcutaneously and five received 50 mg. Twelve cow calves were similarly inoculated, half receiving 10 mg. of culture and half 50 mg. None of these animals died of the inoculation and they were killed off between 152 and 159 days later. All animals put on weight and the post-mortem examinations were classified as follows: (a) Fourteen animals Slight tuberculosis. A lesion at the site of inoculation. Lesions in the thoracic glands and pos- sibly abdominal glands. A few lesions in the lungs or spleen. (b) Five animals Extensive but not severe. As above, but with the addition of tuber- culous pleurisy or peritonitis or both. (c) Three animals Generalized but not progressive. Cases in which there was evidence of invasion of the organs by way of the blood streams with the production of numerous lesions in the lungs. The results are compared with those of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis (2nd interim Report, Part II Appendix, Vol. I, p. 34), which showed that a subcutaneous dose of 50 mg. of culture almost invariably produced fatal gene- ralized tuberculosis within seven weeks and in the case of a 10 mg. dose 60 per cent died within eight weeks. The author concludes from his experiments both on rabbits and on cattle that the virulence of the tubercle bacillus isolated from Indian cattle is lower than that isolated from cattle in Europe. He states: 'Glen Liston's experiments indicated that Indian cattle are less susceptible to infection with the tubercle bacillus than English animals when tested with a virus of European origin.' 'The experiments here recorded indicate that this is not the sole or possibly even the most important factor in determining the comparatively frequent occurrence of tuberculosis in Indian cattle. They appear to indicate beyond all possibility of doubt that the strains of tubercle bacilli affecting cattle in India possess a distinctly lower degree of virulence than tubercle bacilli iosolated from cattle in Europe. 'A point which would appear to support the view that the lower virulence of the organism is the more important factor is that in practically every instance the natural lesions which have come under observation have been restricted to a few glands and have been to a very large extent calcified.' Soparkar [1926] carried out a large-scale experiment to test the susceptibility of various Indian breeds of cattle to tuberculosis. A type strain obtained from the National collection was used in a dose of 50 mg. inoculated subcutaneous- ly. One hundred and forty-one calves were used in the experiment, and the results showed that whilst a considerable number (48) proved very resistant and remained well and lived beyond 90 days, the susceptibility varied consider- ably. Ninety-three died of acute generalised tuberculosis in periods varying from 17 to 101 days. Apparently out of these 93, only 10 showed the very severe type seen in English calves. The author summarizes the position in the following paragraph: ' While the experiments of the Royal Commis- sion on Tuberculosis show that a dose of
J. CARMICHAEL 187 50 mg. of culture of bovine origin given subcutaneously is almost invariably sufficient to overcome the resistance of English (Jersey) cattle, and, with rare exceptions, produces genera- lized tuberculosis of a severe type which proves rapidly fatal, the results of the present experi- ments would indicate that a certain proportion of Indian calves equally small in size remain well after similar infection, and, when autopsied, show slight or minimal lesions, indicating that they are possessed of very high powers of resistance to tuberculosis as compared to English calves.' Soparkar [1927], in a paper dealing with the virulence of tubercle bacilli isolated from cattle in India, reviews Sheather's [1921] results and quite rightly draws attention to the fact that Sheather used cultures which were six months old, which of course detracts considerably from the significance of his results. Soparkar carried out inoculation experiments on rabbits and calves, using both European and Indian strains of tubercle bacilli. Of the Euro- pean strains actively growing young cultures were used, also cultures which were six months old. Of the Indian strains only young cultures were used. It is difficult to draw definite conclusions from the results, but it is quite evident that the European strains six months old were not by any means as virulent as the young cultures, either in rabbits or calves. It is unfortunate that six months old Indian strains were not used in order to make a direct comparison with Sheather's work. Two series of calves were inoculated, one with 21-day-old European cultures (Table V), and the other with Indian cultures of the same age (Table VII). On examination of Table V, i.e. the inocula- tions with European cultures, 13 of the 24 calves died in an average period of 40 days whilst Table VII, i. e., the inoculations with Indian strains, shows that 15 calves died out of 19, but the average period of survival was 71 days. It is difficult to say on these results whether one strain is more or less virulent than the other. However, a number of calves inoculated with the Indian strains did, in fact, die of acute generalized tuberculosis in the same way as those inoculat- ed with a known virulent strain of European origin. This is important and indicates that the Indian strain was not of markedly low virulence, and that individual differences existed in the subjects inoculated. It will be recalled that none of Sheather's [1921] calves died, and when killed they only showed local lesions. All the Indian strains proved highly virulent for rabbits in the same manner as the type European strain. Soparkar's findings are as follows: "The rarity of gross tuberculous lesions hitherto observed among indigenous cattle and the usual tendency of the lesions to remain localized in affected animals, cannot therefore be ascribed to any noteworthy difference in the virulence of the infecting organisms." It must be remembered that the indigenous cattle of India are Zebu in type. Experimental The object of these experiments was to ascer- tain how Zebu calves reacted to a test dose of viru- lent bovine tubercle organisms with a view to discovering whether any resistance to tuberculosis did in fact exist in this breed of cattle. The opportunity was also taken to test calves of the Ankole breed for comparative purposes. Technique. The dose of organisms was fixed at 50 mg. (Royal Commission on Tuberculosis) and was given subcutaneously. All calves were previously tested with tuberculin by the double intradermal test and only non-reactors used in the experiment. The strains used were B.V. 28 and B.V. 34, kindly supplied by Dr. A. S. Griffith of Cambridge as being typical dysgonic virulent bovine cultures of recent isolation. The strains were highly virulent for rabbits in doses of 0.001 mg. intravenously and 10 mg. subcutaneously. The cultures were grown on inspissated ox serum and only young, vigorous cultures, not more than 10 days old were used. As controls to the actual injections of the calves, rabbits and/or goats were inoculated with appropriate doses of the same cultural growths. It was intented to kill off all surviving inoculat- ed calves after a period of 90 days and this was done in a number of cases, but later the survival time was allowed to extend, so as to ascertain in what manner the tissues of a resistant calf would react to a tubercle infection, and perhaps enable the degree of resistance to be more accu- rately assessed.

The Zebu calves showed a marked resistance to tuberculous in- fection as compared with calves of British breeds, but the Ankole calves, on the other hand, proved equally susceptible.

A CLINICAL SURVEY OF INTOXICATIONS OF CATTLE BY SUDAN GRASS (SORGHUM SUDANESE) By A. L. ROSE, B.V.Sc., District Veterinary Officer, Cootamundra, N. S. W. (Reprinted from the Australian Veterinary Journal Vol. 7, No. 6 Dec. 1941.) INTRODUCTION IN the past a good many misapprehensions have existed concerning the toxic properties of sudan grass and its hybrids. It has been stated often that pure sudan grass is not toxic and that mortali- ties occur because impure seed is used by farmers. Sorghum has always been regarded as highly toxic, and sorghum-sudan grass hybrids are said to in- herit the toxic properties of sorghum. Clinical observations made during the years 1931-1938, inclusive, throw a great deal of light on the whole question. The clinical data concerning some thirty-six mortalities have been tabulated and surveyed with the object of furnishing field evi- dence in support of certain contentions. In pre- senting this data in tabulated form it is admitted that much quite important clinical material has had to be omitted., but the inclusion of all the relevant observations would make the recorded matter much too unwieldy in form. During the heavy mortalities of 1931, it became imperative to take advantage of the material offering for investigation, and a great deal of valu- able work was conducted at the Glenfield Veteri- nary Research Station, much of which confirms clinical findings and places some aspects of the matter on a more exact basis. The object of this article is. to record relevant clinical observations. Discussion will be confined to the subject matter given in the accompanying table and will be arranged under appropriate headings. THE IDENTIFICATION OF PLANTS AND SEEDS It became obvious in 1931 that allegedly pure sudan grass seed (Sorghum Sudanese) was capable of producing crops containing plants which differed widely in characteristics. The so-called pure forms consisted of heavily stooling plants bearing a multitude of fine stalks, long narrow leaves and uniform, fine seed. The height of the plants was usually from two to four feet and they had the general appearance of a 'grass'. Coarser forms had fewer stalks, which were much thicker, grew much taller and carried much coarser leaves and irregularly shaped seeds. Sometimes one en- countered a crop which looked nearly pure, while in other cases many, or even the majority, of the plants showed all grades of coarseness. It was found that botanical experts had some difficulty in giving a precise opinion upon specimens submitted for determination, and for this reason the name 'sudan grass' as used in the accompanying table means a plant grown from certified sudan grass seed but which may have developed any of the characteristics described above. It soon became very apparent that no difference in toxicity existed between any of the forms of crops which developed from pure seed. In other words, it was obvious that toxicity did not depend upon hybridization with the coarser sorghum species and that the fine and pure types of sudan grass could be just as toxic as the hybrids. The field observations on this aspect of the matter are supported by analytical data secured by the Veterinary Research Station.
192 Intoxications of Cattle by Sudan Grass TOXICITY IN RELATION TO STAGE OF GROWTH It has been stated often that the crop in flower or seed may be fed off with impunity, but clinical observation proves this assertion to be utterly erroneous and dangerously misleading. The clini- cal observer does not quickly forget the occasions when he arrives at a farm to find a sudan grass pad- dock of several acres with most of the crop in flower and seed, and a dozen or more dairy cows dead and dying after a quarter of an hour's grazing. One good example of such a crop was No. 29 in the table. It has been argued that it is the immature plants that are toxic, but against this one has been careful to submit leaves from the mature forms for analysis. Moreover, the farmer who risks his cattle on unsound advice is not concerned with any neat distinctions, and if the crop is well grown and in seed then that is good enough for him, but to his undoing. It will not be denied that immature crops are probably more toxic than mature crops, but it must be stressed that olinical observation indicates that the plant is never safe. It seems fairly obvious that some disturbance to the even growth rate of the plant is the main factor in rendering it toxic. It has often been stated that a stunted crop is the more dangerous, but such has not been borne out in these observations. How intimately the toxicity factor is bound up with seasonal conditions will be shown in the table and in the next paragraph. THE EFFECT OF SEASONAL CONDITIONS Sudan grass mortalities always occur in waves and one can always anticipate when they are likely to occur. Moreover, when one accident occurs it is usually followed by a number of others in the same or widely separated districts; and at the same time sheep mortalities may occur as the result of the ingestion of well-known cyanogenetic plants such as Cynodon sp., Chenopodium carinatum, and Euphorbia drummondii. This widespread occurr- ence and diversity of mortalities in sheep and cattle as a result of eating cyanogenetic plants is not just chance, but is due to the occurrence of seasonal conditions which favour the production of cyano- genetic glucoside in the plant. Sudan grass is usually planted in the spring (October) and with sufficient soil moisture or rain a good crop results. This being a winter rainfall district, it is normal for the summers to be intensely hot and dry, and under these conditions the crop does not grow, and even though it be sparse and stunted in the paddock and cattle have access to it, no ill-effects follow. If, however, the crop survives till mid-summer and rain occurs under conditions of high temperatures, the sudan grass grows prolifically and the common practice among dairy farmers is to put their cows on to the crop for an hour or so each day. Under such a system the crop holds its growth, stools out freely and milk production increases. These are the seasonal conditions which induce toxicity of crops and mortalities in cattle; but yet another factor seems to be necessary and this will be discussed under the next heading. A glance at the table will show the years when trouble has occurred. They were February March, 1931, December, 1931, January, 1932, then nothing occurred until the series commencing in December, 1934, and ending in January, 1935. There was thereafter again a period of immunity from trouble till December, 1937, when followed another series of losses which ended the next month. THE PART PLAYED BY GRASSHOPPER INVASIONS The seasons already referred to as favouring the good growth of sudan grass are also those which favour the hatching, swarming and invasion of the district with grasshoppers. These pests advance up the valleys of creeks and rivers and attack anything that is green. Sudan grass they devour in any stage of its growth and remain on it long enough only to eat the crop to the ground, so that viewed from a little distance the paddock appears bare. To do this the swarms may remain from two to ten days and then pass on. During the visitation many of the plants are eaten into the ground and are completely destroyed. In a showery summer, some rain falls after the crop has been eaten back, warmth continues and the re-growth is very rapid. Meanwhile, owing to a lack of feed and in order to allow the sudan grass an opportunity to recover, the cattle are kept out of the paddock for a period, generally in the region of two weeks. The first grazing of the crop after this spell is the fatal one and usually symp- toms are manifest in about ten minutes. In that time sufficient of the crop may be eaten to kill half the herd. A reference to the table will show how almost invariably the grasshoppers have been associated with these mortalities, so that one has come to regard these pests as almost an essential factor. It is considered, however, that their ac- tion must be a mechanical one only, and that if some other factor was responsible for cutting the crop in precisely similar circumstances and the same favourable conditions for re-growth occurred the crop would doubtless be just as toxic as if eaten back by grasshoppers. Factors which might occur in practice are mowing and heavy stocking. The broom millet crop referred to in No. 35 of the table is the only one of the series known to have been cut. Cutting right back by grazing seldom occurs, it being the usual practice to allow a limited daily grazing ; but when such has occurred, the herd is
A. L. ROSE 193 usually rotated to another sudan crop on the farm, returning to the original crop when the first has re- grown. In these circumstances intoxication and loss has not occurred, and one wonders therefor if some sort of tolerance to the toxic factor is no developed by the herd.

L. ROSE 195 EVIDENCE THAT CATTLE MAY BECOME TOLERANT TO TOXIC SUDAN GRASS Inserted in the table is a series of analytical figures referring to several paddocks of sudan grass in which no losses occurred (No. 9). All paddocks were on the same small farm, some were severely damaged by grasshoppers, while others were affect- ed to a less extent. In all, there was sufficient of the crop left to allow the cattle a daily feed right through the grasshopper invasion. Specimens of the plant were taken for analysis from time to time while the cattle were feeding off it. The resulting figures were all extremely high; much higher than those for many of the fatal crops, yet no sickness or losses occurred. At the same time, cattle were being lost under standard conditions on farms al- most adjoining (Nos. 5, 6 and 7). Other examples are less striking and are cases in which a few cows of little value or a few head of young stock have been left in a crop right through the period of inva- sion and re-growth, and have suffered no ill-effects. The case of No. 10 is not comparable, for the crops on that property suffered little or no damage from grasshoppers. THE EFFECT OF HUNGER There is both theoretical and practical evidence- that hungry cattle, which have eaten a paddock of toxic sudan grass, will succumb more rapidly. Hungry cattle will obviously eat more plant in a given time and therefore will more quickly absorb their toxic quota. Experience has shown, however, that it is not necessarily safe to attempt grazing off toxic crop with cattle which are not hungry. Such crops must be regarded as valueless for cattle, though they may be used for sheep with a high degree of safety. SHEEP ON SUDAN GRASS Sudan grass has been quite a popular summer feed for sheep, especially fattening lambs, and quite often farmers have been advised to turn sheep on to a crop which has proved toxic for cattle and with one small exception no ill-effects have follow- ed. The crop referred to in No. 16 of the table was used to fatten 200 lambs after the accident to the cattle and three of the lambs died, presumably from HCN poisoning. At times when cattle mor- talities were occurring, sheep were being grazed on sudan grass under exactly similar conditions and with no harmful effects. The only sheep mortality referred to in the table (No. 30) was in somewhat unusual conditions and on Johnston grass, which is considered to be far more toxic than sudan grass. SYMPTOMS The symptoms shown by cattle in HCN poison- ing from sudan grass are not very distinctive. An increased rate of respiration is constant and this may be shown before any other abnormality is noted. A cow first ceases feeding and stands in an agitated, restless manner; the respirations increase and marked distress soon follows. There may be some salivation and odd animals rush about and bellow. Many cases go down quite early and lie prostrate, moaning and breathing rapidly. Death may take place in a few minutes, but some cows will remain down for some hours and then die. Cases that are on the ground for any considerable time usually become affected with hoven. LATENT PERIOD The period between the time of access to the crop and the onset of symptoms varies, the variation being due to the amount of crop eaten in the time, and to the concentration of hydrocyanic acid in the crop. Reference to this latent period is made in the table. The shortest observed time is five minutes and it is probable that symptoms were obvious in most cases in ten minutes and the death of the first case would occur shortly afterwards. Reference will be made elsewhere* to the amount of plant that might be expected to be lethal under varying conditions of toxic concentration, but clinically it has been obvious that in some cases a pound of the plant was sufficient to cause death. TREATMENT A consideration of the data in the table will show that mortality may be heavy or absent, in the latter case the animals recovering completely. Very many cows recover without any treatment. Many cases die much too quickly for treatment to be applied, but the treatment of animals which survive for half an hour or more may be the means of saving their lives. Generally the farmer himself has neither the knowledge nor the means to do anything of benefit. The sudden collapse of a number of his cattle and the early death of some of them leads him in desperate haste either to the telephone or to his neighbour, and on at least three occasions the farmer has been known to cut off the animals' tails to make them bleed. For a long time it has been regarded by some that the liberal sub-cutaneous injections of ether has a very beneficial effect, the drug being used to give a quick stimulant effect. Ether was tried on one occasion only (No. 13). The twelve treated animals were given 20 mils of ether about fifteen minutes after they went down, followed by another 20 mils. The farmer credited the injection with saving the cattle, but there was no evidence that it was of benefit. Artificial respiration has been * Hind Marsh, W. L.

196 Inquest on a Curriculum employed on prostrate animals whose treating had become slow and shallow, probably with benefit. In animals showing tympany, the use of the trocar and canula to relieve intra-abdominal pressure on the thorax is undoubtedly an essential precaution. In 1937 a line of treatment was adopted which gave results of immediate and very obvious benefit. The formula adopted was based on the suggestion of Bunyea (1935) and consists of the hypodermic injection of the following solution: Sodium nitrate . . . 3 gm. Sodium thiosulphate . . 15 gm. Water . . . . 20 mils This injection has been given to a number of cattle which appeared to be on the point of death; some of them have responded immediately and have got up within a few minutes, and all of the cattle treated have recovered. There has been sufficient evidence to support the opinion that this treatment is specific. There is evidence, too, that cattle will not tolerate a dose much in excess of that mentioned. SUMMARY 1. An account of a number of serious losses from sudan grass poisoning has been given and is sup- ported by a tabulated statement of some principal data. 2. There is evidence that pure sudan grass may be just as toxic as are its hybrids with sorghum. 3. The seasonal conditions which predispose to intoxications are those in which rain falls during the heat of the summer, inducing optimum growth of the plant. 4. Sudan grass which has been eaten to the ground by grasshoppers and which is re-growing rapidly after rain has proved, in almost all cases, to be at the dangerous stage. 5. A few mortalities on other sorghum species such as ambercane, Johnston grass and broom millet are also recorded. 6. Particulars are given of what appears to be a specific line of treatment, especially if adopted along with symptomatic treatment. 7. In conclusion it can be postulated that none of the sorghum species can be considered safe to feed off to cattle at any stage of their growth following the conditions which have been described, REFERENCE Bunyea, H. (1935). J. Amer. Vet. med. Ass. 86, 666 INQUEST ON A CURRICULUM (Reprinted from The Lancet August 30, 1941) KNOWLEDGE of medicine is handed from seniors to beginners according to the Hippocratic rule, and perhaps in no other profession is learning so generously and directly shared. But medicine stands alone in that the leaders and teachers live and practice in a different world from the great body of the profession. It is an old cry that the aim of the medical curriculum should be to turn out good general practitioners: how do we set about it ? From the moment of registration the student is taught by specialists, most of whom have no experience of general practice. At the end of the course, and of a few resident appoint- ments, he is wellInquest on a Curriculum 197 the details of some nursing procedure. To the patient he was a young chap not quite up to it; to himself he was a young chap far beyond it: and both were true198 Inquest on a Curriculum ailments and the simpler gynaecological condi- tions; that he should have a wider knowledge of public health, of national health, insurance, of compensation and rehabilitation. They see the general practitioner, in short, as part of the social welfare organization of the country and would have him competent to undertake that duty. Nor are they oblivious of the groundwork on which such training must rest. They ask for greater integration in the curriculum, and for orientation courses which would bring the various subjects into proper relationship at the outset. One subject in which an orientation course would be particularly valuable is anatomy; a teacher suggests that the whole body might be dissected rapidly before the class, by an expert, before students are allowed to begin on a part. All who remember the bewilder- ment of their first month in the dissecting-room will agree with him. Some of the detail might be cut out and he suggests that anatomy should be taught on younger subjects, preferably beginning with the foetus, so that students may see the organs at various stages of development, not only in the degeneration or atrophy of old age. Not unnaturally, the most practical suggestions for improvement of the curriculum come from general practitioners themselves. They would like the student to have free access to the patients in the chronic wards of infirmaries, to see more minor infectious illnesses like tonsillitis, and more minor injuries like sprains. They would like him to have personal experience of dispensing, not of writing 'rep. mist.' and leaving the rest to the dispenser; to be confident of giving a safe anaesthetic; to know some practical psychology and more about mental disease and defect; and to realize that there is no mystery about children's diseases or infant feeding. They think he should know more about the trifling ills of womenABSTRACTS The composition and properties of goats milk G. M. TROUT (1941). Bull. Mich. agric. Exp. Sta., 23, 254-64 FOURTY samples of bulk milk from individual goats and from herds on analysis gave an average fat percen- tage of 3.91±0.75 and total solids 13.00±1.04. The fat percentage of the milk varied widely between the breeds. Fat was determined by Babcock method, total solids by the Majonnier method and the S. N. F. was calculated from the values obtained for fat and total solids. Nubian milk was rich in fat (4.41), Steanen milk slightly less (4.18) and Toggenberg milk least (3.54). The ash content of 17 samples of goat's milk showed an average 0.923 per cent, with a range from 0.872 to 0.972 percent. The ash content was slightly higher than that of cows milk. The ash content of breed milk varied slightly with the fat. Specific gravity determinations of 17 samples gave a mean of 1.0337, with a range from 1.032 to 1.035. The titrable acidity of 39 samples of fresh milk brought to the laboratory packed in ice well below 50°F., ranged from 0.12 to 0.275 per cent with an average of 0.199 per cent. This is contrary to the opinion that goat's milk is alkaline in reaction when compared with cow's milk. The pH of the goat's milk (19 samples) ranged from 6.33 to 6.52 which is a lower figure when compared to cow's milk. The average flavour score of 40 samples was 21.75 which is to be recognized as good flavour. Of the above 19 samples scored 23 and above having no flavour criticism. Of the off flavours present, those of 'feed' were noted in 10 samples. [C. P. A.] A simple differential medium for mastitis testing J. G. DAVIS (1941).

He believed that these animals were immune in the way that the most large African game animals within tsetse-fly belts are. Subsequent history of these surviving animals, however, as indicated above was different, and the author has consequently come to the conclusion that "no method of immunization which will enable East African domestic stock to thrive in tsetse- fly belts has yet been devised". [F. N. R.] The value of dogfish meal as a protein supple- ment. M. RHIAN, J. S. CARVER, R. W. HARRI SON, and W. S. HAMM (1942). Bull.agric. Exp. Sta., State Coll. of Washington, 416, 1-24. VARIOUS experiments were carried out to determine the effects of different methods of processing on the gross valve of meals made from dogfish. The data presented indicate that the commercial dogfish meals available in Washington were of a low nutritive value as judged by growth experiments carried out on chicks. Other experiments were carried out to determine the relative values of wet and dry methods of processing the meals. Wet process meals were prepared as follows: the fish were ground, cooked with live steam at atmospheric pressure, pressed to remove oil and water, and dried in a steam vacuum drier. The dry process meals, were prepared by drying the fish in a steam-jacketed vacuum drier and removing the oil by pressing the dried product in a hydraulic press. The wet processed meals gave as good results per unit of protein as ordinary fish meals and very much better results than commercial or laboratory dry process catfish moal. The data also suggest that the quality of fish meal proteins deteriorates fairly rapidly after manufacture and that it is very probable that the fish meals as used under commercial conditions, are much poorer in value than meals at the time of manufacture. An initial trial with materials treated with formaldehyde prior to processing suggested that such treatment may be harmful to the resulting product. However, later trials demonstrated that the harmful effect obtained in the initial trial could not be attributed to formaldehyde treatment. The essential difference between the wet and dry pro- cess treatments of the fish meal used is that a large amount of water soluble material is removed during the wet-process. The hypothesis is put forward that the wet-process meals may have lost some substance which is either toxic to the chicks or which adversely affects the protein. A sample of commercial (dry-process) dogfish meal, which was re-processed by the wet-process gave consider- ably better growth results in chicks than the original type of meal. From the results of this experiment in conjunction with those of earlier work the authors conclude that, though uric acid is not utilized by the chick, it is not harmful to the feeding value of a food except that it affects the determination of the protein content. The average protein (N/6.25) of the commercial (dry- process) dogfish meal was 77.3 per cent. and that of the wet-process dogfish meal was 67.5 per cent. It is sug- gested that unadulterated dogfish meals of exceptionally high protein content (N/6.25) especially with a high uric content, are likely to be dry-process meals. [A. J. M.] Various oils and fats as substitutes for butter fat in the ration of young calves. T. W. GULLICK- SON, F. C. FOUNTAINE and J. B. FITCH (1942) J. Dairy Sci., 25, 117 THE comparative feeding value of vegetable oils like coconut, peanut, corn, cottonseed and soybean oils, and animal fats, such as butterfat, lard and tallow, for young dairy calves was measured by the rate of gain in weight and by observing the physical appearance and general well-being of the animals. Calves were put under ex- periment at the age of one to two weeks. Fats or oils, mixed at the rate of 3.5 lb. to every 96.5 lb. skim milk and homogenized to give a product containing 3.5 per cent of the fat or oil, were fed to the respective groups of animals, with the following low fat content concentrate mixture-dry beet pulp, 200 lb. ; dry skim milk, 50 lb.; gluten milk, 50 lb. ; cod liver oil U. S. P., 25 to 35 cc. and some alfalfa hay. Two control groups were run simultaneously, (1) entirely on a fat poor ration, skim milk (0.01-0.02 per cent fat) along with the following concentrate mixture-ground molasses beet pulp, 100 lb. dry skim milk, 50 lb.; starch, 50 lb. and cerelose, 25 lb.; and (2) on whole milk not homogenized. The periods ranged from a few days to about six months. The average daily intakes of nutrients per 100 lb. live weight of calves fed various fats and oils were 1.62 lb. for the whole milk, 1.82 lb. for the butter oil, 1.57 lb. for the low fat, 1.83 lb. for the lard, 2.0 lb. for the tallow, 1.71 lb. for the coconut oil, 1.96 lb. for the peanut oil, 1.71 lb. for the corn oil, 1.59 lb. for the cottonseed oil, and 1.37 lb. for the soybean oil groups. The average daily gain in the weight of calves of the respective groups were 1.43 lb., 1.22 lb., 1.07 lb., 1.17 lb., 1.24 lb., 0.96 lb., 0.80 lb., 0.40 lb., 0.31 lb., and 0.32 lb. The calves fed butter fat excelled those in all other fat or oil groups in physical condition, general well-being without any complaint of scour and in average gain in weight. Corn-oil-cotton seed oil and soybean-oil fed groups were the least satisfactory, and the animals were most severely affected with indigestion or scour among the other groups, and soms of them died. Another significant difference noted between the groups was the greater deposition of fat in the carcasses of the milk-fat-fed calves. [B. C. R. S.] Enzymatic production of bacterial polysaccharides. M. STACEY (1942). Nature, 149, 639 SEVERAL investigators have reported the synthesis of Polysaccharide by enzyme preparations obtained from various species of spore-forming b acilli. The author also describes some of his experiments, in this line, which are of considerable importance in the study of the mecha- nism of symbiosis of yeast and bacteria. He found that Leuconostoc mesenteroiles, grown in symbiotic association with Succharomyces cerevisioe, forms mucoid dextran more rapidly than when grown alone. The production of this dextran, at one stage, is attri- buted to 'exocellular enzymatic action. The enzyme system is, on the other hand, suggested to be sharply stimulated by a factor elaborated in situ by the living yeast cells. The purified dextran [ABSTRACTS 201 serum tube test for the diagnosis of S. pullorum infection was investigated under field conditions. A total of 1750 tests were carried out on three infected farms whereby an agreement of 98.34 per cent was established between the two tests. Twenty-nine birds gave conflicting results, but on bacteriological examination S. pullorum was re- covered from 15 out of 26 birds thus tested. Actually out of 228 reactors, including those from which the casual organism was isolated the rapid whole-blood test and the serum tube test showed an error of 6.1 and 0.4 per cent respectively. In similar trials carried out on 1519 birds, from which S. pullorum could not be isolated, the serum tube test may have condemned 0.5 per cent and the rapid test 0.2 per cent. Better results were achieved in subsequent test made at the laboratory when an agreement of 99.31 per cent was established. The authors have since used the rapid test on three other fairly heavily infected farms and concluded that this method, as a preliminary, has the advantage of eliminating a large percentage of infected birds. [J. A. I.] Studies with equine streptococci, 3. Vaccination against strangles. P. M. BAZELEY (1942). Aust. Vet. J., 18, 141-55 THE view has been expressed after consulting the literature, that there is no satisfactory immunizing agent against the disease Strangles. The author using a cautiously heat killed vaccine showed that a significant immunity could be established in mice. In the present paper he has recorded his results on horses using five types of vaccines. They are classified as follows:202 ABSTRACTS in the host have had very encouraging results in man, horses and dogs ; much less so in ruminants. The applica- tion of mass treatments of man and animals is not, how- ever without its disadvantages : financial as well as administrative and consequently comparatively little has been done. There remains, therefore the treatment of fæcal material before it is used as manure. This may be physical, chemical or both. The physical treat- ment involves natural or artificial heat as a killing agent. Natural heat may be generated in a well-packed manure pile or in an insulated manure box. Artificial heat involves a specially constructed manure box. Comparatively little has been done to find chemical methods of destroying the free-living stages of the nema- todes. It is a problem which presents many difficulties probably the greatest of which is the fact that the eggs- and larvæ are always in close contact with fæces, soil or grass, and many chemicals which might be used are par- tially or completely counteracted by contact with organic matter. Nevertheless chemical control of all free-living stages does appear to have considerable practical possibi- lities. It offers opportunity of using fæcal material as manure and even of enriching the manurial value and it does not necessitate special equipment. The joint authors record their experience with ninety- eight chemicals while dealing with Selerostomes of horses. 1. Some chemicals such as flowers of sulphur destroy only the fungi without affecting the eggs or the larva of worms. 2. Some chemicals, such as ferrous sulphide, ferric oxide, ground limestone, rock phosphate, basic slage, derris, white helledore, and pyrethrum powders are inert. 3. Some chlorides and sulphates, sodium and potassium hydroxide and potassium permanganate occasionally cause exsheathment. These chemicals, in slightly greater proportions, generally also cause the death of the larvæ. 4. A large number of chemicals mixed with fæces in certain proportions allow a considerable number of eggs to hatch and the larvæ to reach the infective stage and then compratively rapidly kill the larvæ. Such chemicals are quicklime, cupric, ferric and ferrous sulphates, zinc sulphate and zinc sulphide, the chlorides of copper, iron and zinc, cuprie nitrate, sodium fluosilicate and oxy- quinoline sulphate. Other chemicals which cause de- layed death are nicotine sulphate, trisodium phosphate, sulphate and chloride of manganese, sodium and mag- nesium borate strong cresol, phenol and calcium hypo- chloride 5. Larvae having thick sheath and the egg in the centre if the lump of fæces may be protected from the action of chemicals. 6. Applied dry, chemicals which are deliquescent have more prospect of being of practical value, for the moisture which they attract may also attract the larvæ. With very lethal chemicals, such as iodine salts, it has been found that very considerably less chemical is necessary to produce sterilization with a very weak rather than with a very strong solution. Some chemicals such as chloropicrin, calcium cyanide, naphthalene, O' and para' dichlorobenzene can be used as gases. The cost of the chemical has also to be taken into account. Urine has more or less all the advantages. Another class of chemicals are the artificial fertilizers. Aniline and pyridine are lethal both to fly larvæ and sclerotome larvæ. The advuntage of such a dual steri- lizer is obvious from the economic point of view. At the end of the article is given a list of chemicals used, with the percentage necessary to cause sterlization and the strength of the solution to be used. [G. D.

THE authors have studied the normal values of the concentration of inorganic phosphorus in more than 000 samples of whole blood taken from 59 dairy cattleABSTRACTS 203 discharge from the eyes and nose, in some cases ulceration of the correa, rapid respiration during the warmer part of the day and frequent convulsions. Four of the experi- mental animals were given different doses of cod liver oil and they made a rapid recovery. Three other animals were given the same doses of cod liver oil in which the vitamin A was destroyed and the animals showed no improvement. At this stage the feed was supplemented with alfalfa hay and pure crystallire carotene in maize oil. The animals made a rapid recovery. The animals without vitamin A supplement died on the 179th day of experiment. Observations showed that night blindness was the first noticeable symptom in the development of vitamin A deficiency syndrome, and the author used it as a guide in determining the depletion of vitamin A body reserve. It was ascertained that the optimum re- quirement of carotene for cattle was 2,500204 ABSTRACTS milks forewarmed to 95°C. and to 140°C. were 45 and 86 milks-respectively. Milks of excessive acidity coagulated when subjected to high temperature forewarming, but normal milks of good quality withstood temperatures of 150°C. to 160°C. without coagulating. Undesirable changes in colour and flavour and an increase in acid intensity were noticed when forowar ming temperatures above 140°C. were used. It was observed that milks, falling within the stability range of 25 to 40 minutes, possessed a commercially acceptable body. Milks below this range showed a slight grain or were of excessive viscosity, and those with a stability greater than 40 minutes were thin at the end of an 18 minutes sterilization period. The data indicate that the high forewarming temperature required to produce an evaporated milk of a certain desired viscosity may be within limits 2°C. for one milk or within limits as wide as 60°C. for another milk. The optimum tempe- rature depends upon the nature of the stability curve for each milk and hence its estimation presents some diffi- culties, although it usually falls between 120°C. and 140°C. when a coming up time of 4 seconds and a holding time of 25 seconds are used. When no clue is available the safest procedure would be to forewarm the milk to 130ORIGINAL ARTICLES PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF EXPERIMENTAL FLUOROSIS IN CATTLE I. BONE LESIONS IN CATTLE FED A DIET ADEQUATE IN CALCIUM AND LOW IN PHOSPHORUS By P. G. PANDE, M.Sc., M.R.C.V S., Research Officer (Pathology), Animal Nutrition Section Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 25 July 1944) (With Plates XVI-XIX) FROM biochemical studies on materials from cases of 'osteomalacia' in Hyderabad [Mahajan, 1934-35], it can now be suggested that fluorine is mainly concerned in producing the affection [Majumdar, Ray and Sen 1943]. Clinical and epizootiological findings of Vishwanathan [1934-35] and Ramiah [1939-40] point to the same aetiology in 'rheumatic arthritis' of cattle in Madras. As regards the pathology of these affections, little information is available, except that clini- cally and in gross osseous changes, the condi- tion resembles osteomalacia. It was neces- sary, therefore, to investigate these cases from a pathological standpoint. As regards osseous changes, it is generally agreed [Rohoim, 1937; Cohrs, 1941] that these are greatly influenced by such factors as age, dosage and nature of fluorine compounds, the duration of ingestion, and the animal's prevailing dietetic condition. Before studying materials from spontaneous cases, it was, therefore, decided to examine materials from experimentally-induced cases in which the factors concerned could be adequately controlled. In this paper the pathological findings are described of bones from fully mature hill bulls which had been fed with 3-4 mg. fluorine per kgm. body weight. The animals examined belonged to the 'high fluorine' group of bulls fed by Majumdar et al [1934] and an account of feeding of these ani- mals and the dose of fluorine administered can be consulted from a recent publication by these authors. The following is the clinical protocol of animals of the group. Hill bull No. 167 Four years and six months, NaF ingestion for about nine months. Clinical. Gradual loss of weight, general emaciation, hide-bound appearance, skin denu- ded of hair in patches, bowels irregular, belly tucked up, haemorrhage from nose, conjuncti- val membranes anaemic, prolonged decubitus and difficulty in rising, exostoses present on the left matacarpus and left metatartus.

Clinical. Extreme emaciation, scurfy coat, bed sores on the skin, eyes sunken, lachryma- tion and excoriation of skin below the inner canthi of eyes, upward curvature of columna, appetite impaired, periodic diarrhoea, hoofs cracked and elongated, and the left hind leg often kept raised from the ground due to frac- ture of the thigh bone. Right matacarpus showed several nodular growths, left metacar- pus showed a flattened exostosis, left metatarsus stouter than the right one. Blood picture.

Clinical. General loss of condition and weight, hidebound appearance, loss of appetite, occasional diarrhoea, stiffness of gait, eyes sunken, visible mucosae anaemic, hoofs elong- ated and cracked. Both the metacarpal bones appeared thicker than normal due to the pre- sence of extensive exostoses occupying more or less the entire anterior surfaces of the bones; right metatarsus had a nodular exostosis about the middle of the shaft and palpable periosteal thickenings on the anterior surface of both ends of the bone.

GROSS PATHOLOGY The osseous changes under this heading may be considered as common to all animals of the 'High Fluorine Group'. After maceration, all bones appeared whiter than normal, and the exostoses porous on close examination. None of the bones could be cut with a knife, but some, when tested with a saw yielded more easily to a depth corresponding to the thickness of the exostoses. The periosteum over the exostoses appeared to be thickened, closely adherent to the bone and markedly hyperaemic. The marrow was gelatinous and contained reddened patches and dilated capillaries, this feature being more marked in the metaphyses. On longitudi- nal section of the femur, the compacta revealed an irregular thickness and isolated areas (Plate XVI, fig. 1) of esorbed bone. Sections of bone across the exostoses revealed the latter as sharply defined areas, whiter in colour than normal compacta, from which it was clearly demarcated by a line (Plate XVI, fig. 2) and could often be detached during sawing. Gen- erally, the cut surface of the compacta appears smooth, but in areas showing active periosteal growth, the cut surfaces reveal 'islands' of slightly hyperaemic soft tissue, presumably residual masses of periosteum entrapped due to their inability to keep pace with the growing exostoses. The metaphyses were composed of a smaller number of loose and thin trabeculae enclosing wide spaces containing rather little hyperaemic marrow. The epiphyseal cartilages were wavy in outline and irregular in width. Long bones without palpable exostoses during life revealed thickened subperiosteal tissue which had been transformed into a white granular layer, repre- senting the early stages of an exostosis. On longitudinal section of the costal epiphysis the cartilaginous junction appeared as an irregu- lar line with tongues of cartilage projecting into the subchondral spongiosa. HISTOPATHOLOGY Pieces of bone, 2-3 mm. thick, were fixed in 5 per cent neutral formol-saline, decalcified in 5 per cent nitric acid in 60 per cent alcohol followed by washing in 70 per cent alcohol. The tissues were then passed through chloro- form to paraffin, according to the technique given by Kolin [1942]. In some cases exos- toses and costal epiphyses were examined with- out decalcification by the method of Thomas, Clark and Schulz [1940], followed by staining by V, Kossa's method or its modification by Moolman [1941]. For histological work the lesions selected were those on the metatarsal and metacarpal bones, the epiphysis and diaphysis of the rib and the distal extremity of the femur. A des- cription more or less common to all the three fluorosis cases is given. Metacarpus and metatarsus Cross sections at the level of the exostosis usual- ly revealed three well-defined zones (Plate XVII fig. 1), the innermost corresponding to the old compacta, the middle to the exostosis and the outermost to the periosteum. Microscopically, the exostosis was found to be composed of a mesh-work of trabeculae arising from the outer- limit of the old compacta. The portion of exostosis, adjacent to the old compacta, was more compact in appearance, and the trabe- culae for the most part better calcified with well-developed osteocytes and only thin osteoid borders. The part of the exostosis towards the periphery, on the other hand, looked more spongy, the trabeculae being arranged more irregularly with wider spaces between them and consisting of poorly calcified axes and wider un- calcified osteoid tissues on either side. The faulty nature and the poor degree of calcifica- tion of the trabeculae in this part were revealed by V. Kossa's method as irregular black- stained masses of calcium scattered through the matrix (Plate XVIII, fig. 1). These seldom coalesced to form one continuous black colour as in normal bone. The osteoid tissues were lined by a single layer of osteoblasts, and similar cells were found on the surface of the calcifying osteoid tissues, although the latter also con- tained osteocytes. The residual masses of peri- osteum in the growing exostosis showed ossi- fication (Plate XVII, fig. 2) by metaplasia This was apparently brought about by the formation of numerous acidophilic masses which later coalesced to form trabeculae lined with osteoblasts arising from the periosteal

By the same process of metaplasia, the periosteum at its outer limit was trans- formed into bone. The intertrabecular spaces contained osteoblasts and other cells of the periosteum. In the region where the perios- teum still persisted, the subperiosteal tissue contained numerous osteoblasts, indicating peri- osteal activity for the formation of new bone. Histologically, the architecture of the old compacta showed an abnormal disposition of young haversian canals. The formation of these structures at one part of a section was found to have proceeded at a high speed, so that they were closely crowded (Plate XVII, fig. 3), while at other parts no such changes were discernible. Newly formed haversian canals were composed entirely of osteoid tissue (Plate XVIII, fig. 3), which showed poor or no signs of lamellation and irregular calcification. Certain areas in the diaphysis, comprising the outer limit of the old compacta, showed numerous cement lines indicating active periosteal appo- sition of bone in which the lamellae were poorly calcified and the interlamellar spaces traversed by Volkman's canals. In the course of these canals young haversian spaces were found to be developing, and the previous lamellar arrange- ment giving place to a haversian system of lamellae formation. This seemed to have arisen by osteoclastic resorption of the existing lamellae, subsequent deposition of osteoid tissues and finally canalization of this tissue. A potential haversian canal, appearing in the osteoid tissue thus formed, contained a conglo- meration of osteoblasts, and the same cells were scattered on the osteoid tissue (Plate XVIII, fig. 3), indicating its osteoblastic origin. Haversian canals of similar nature and origin were found in the earlier formed layers of the exostosis, thus tending to obliterate the line of demarcation between the newly-formed bone and the original compacta. Costal epiphysis Lesions hitherto undescribed in cattle were found in the rib epiphysis involving the epiphy- seal cartilage and the sub-chondral spongiosa. The proliferating zone of cells in the epiphyseal cartilage was absent. The zone of preliminary calcification, which in the normal rib (Plate XVIII, fig. 2) constitutes a sort of grid-like arrangement, had disappeared giving place to a small number of thin and atrophied trabeculae (Plate XVIII, fig. 4), masses of collagenous fibrils interspersed with osteoblasts and a few recently formed trabeculae (Plate XVI, fig. 3). Apparently these had resulted from extensive resorption of the original trabeculae by osteo- clasts or osteoblasts, a subsequent development of collagenous fibrils and finally the formation therefrom of young trabeculae. The collage- nous tissue from which the young trabeculae arose, were being transformed into small and irregular matrices (Plate XVI, fig. 3) resulting from condensation of the fibrils into homogenous masses acidophilie in character. These fused together to form trabeculae in which osteoblasts of the original tissue still predominated. The trabeculae thus formed were poorly calcified and the osteoblasts had acquired lacunar spaces and were being transformed into osteocytes. These trabeculae were often irregularly disposed and their osteoid borders while not abnormal in width, unlike those of normally calcified trabe- culae, were irregularly demarcated from the calcified zone. V. Kossa's method revealed the axial parts of the trabeculae as irregularly calci- fied zones (Plate XVII, fig. 4), having rugged borders against the osteoid tissue. The osteoid contained few osteoblasts on the surface and a single layer of similar cells on the free borders. Lower down in the metaphyseal spongiosa were found trabeculae which, although poorly and irregularly calcified, possessed no definite osteoid borders. Instead, each of them was closely apposed to a syncytium of osteoblasts, some of which were enclosed in lacunar spaces. These tissues appeared to have proliferated, due to the osteogenic property of the osteo- blasts, as 'buds' arising from the main syncytial mass (Plate XVI, fig. 4), were being trans- formed into bone by a direct process of ossi- fication. The intertrabecular spaces contained practically no marrow cells, the chief elements of the marrow being the reticulum and the osteoblasts. Costal diaphysis Examination showed a considerable resorption in the cortex and medullary spongiosa. The former although normal in width, was techni- cally transformed into a structure composed of widely separated trabeculae (Plate XIX, fig. 1), having osteoid borders lined by single layer of osteoblasts. The medullary spongiosa was composed of a few unconnected slender trabe- culae, lined by osteoid tissues of normal width. Osteoclastic resorption of the trabeculae was also going on in this region of the bone, and the intertrabecular spaces, bounded by resorbed trabeculae, contained disintegrating and a few intact osteoclasts, numerous osteoblasts mixed with collagenous fibrils and osseous debris from resorbed trabeculae.
208 Pathology and Pathogenesis of Experimental Fluorosis in Cattle Distal epiphysis of femur The normal disposition of trabeculae im- mediately below the epiphyseal line had dis- appeared, giving place to irregularly disposed trabeculae of normal structure. These trabe- culae apparently were of recent formation since they showed slight clacification (Plate XIX, fig. 3). Some of the more recently-formed trabe- culae showed accumulations of osteoblasts at the surface, indicating their osteoblastic origin. The usual process of breakdown and rebuilding of bone had taken place through the activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts respectively; as evidence of the former phenomenon, the osteo- clasts presented a picture of 'dissecting resorp- tion' (Plate XIX, fig. 2) of trabeculae. The intertrabecular spaces were occupied as a rule by net-works of reticulum and osteoblasts, but those immediately below the epiphyseal cartil- age contained dilated cappillaries and collage- nous fibrils, the latter presumably arising from osteoblasts since these cells showed fibrillar pro- jections at either end and contained elongated nuclei. The collagenous fibrils at places show- ed areas of condensation crowded with osteo- blasts, some of which could be seen developing lucunar spaces. PATHOGENESIS Chronic fluorine intoxication in animals is a generalized chachectic condition, as the absorbed fluorine compounds affect various organs of the body. In attempting to explain the patho- genesis of the disease, attention has been direct- ed especially to the mineral metabolism, to the relation between fluorine and parathyroid and thyroid, and finally to vitamins, particularly vitamin C. Further, the type of lesion depends on such factors as dose and nature of fluorine compounds ingested, duration of inges- tion and the prevailing dietetic condition. On the basis of certain biochemical data and histo- logical findings in affected bones, an attempt may be made to explain certain features of the pathogenesis. As far as the symptoms and the gross osseous changes are concerned, chronic fluorine intoxi- cation may be looked upon as an osteodystro- phia, but the question arises whether, as with certain classical osteodystrophias, the osseous changes in fluorosis also become manifest as a result of disturbed calcium and phosphorous metabolism. Before attempting a complete answer to this question the effects of a high dose of NaF on the calcium and phos- phorus contents of blood and bones of the experimental animals may be examined. TABLE I Calcium and phosphorus in blood and thigh bones of animals given high dose of NaF (Majumdar et al 1943). Hill Bull No. Bone (gm. per 100 gm. of ash) Blood Ca (mg. per 100 c.c. of serum) and P (mg. per 100 c.c. of blood) after 7 months' fluorins feeding Ca P Ca P 167 41.5 17.3 9.9 3.7 180 40.0 17.3 9.6 5.4 402 39.5 17.4 8.6 5.4 Control 89 41.0 17.3 10.4* 4.73* *Average The figures in Table I clearly indicate that the high fluorine intake did not lower the cal- cium and phosphorus values of the blood and bone appreciably. Metabolism studies on these animals by Majumdar et al [1943] showed slightly negative Ca and P values. This feature taken in conjunction with the slight lowering of blood calcium might suggest that the pathogenesis of fluorine intoxication is, to some extent, connected with a fall in blood calcium. Against this is the fact that by feed- ing extra calcium as phosphate and carbonate to another group of experimental animals, which were getting the same quantity of fluo- rine, symptoms and lesions of fluorine intoxi- cation were not prevented. The negative Ca and P balance observed by Majumdar et al may, therefore, have been due to a generalized toxic effect of NaF interfering with the animals' appetites and so leading to lowered intake of Ca and P. Evidently fluorine has no direct effect on the metabolism of these minerals, and its effects on bone can hardly be explained solely on the basis of negative Ca balance. Histological examination of certain parts of the skeleton, particularly the spongiosa, reveals excessive resorption of trabeculae, indicating a considerable withdrawal of Ca and P. This would suggest a rise in output of Ca and P, but in view of only a slight increase which has already been accounted for, one might agree with Roholm [1937] that the actual explana- tion of the phenomenon lies not in the negative Ca balance, but in the primary calcioprive mechanism of fluorine affecting the usual calcium depots of the bone. The question therefore, arises as to the fate of calcium with drawn from these skeletal depots, and this can be explained on the assumption that fluorine,

PANDE 209 apart from its calcioprive property, exercises a special tissue effect leading to the production of hyperplastic changes. These are as follows: 1. Formation of loose osseous tissue between the periosteum and compacta of the long bones which appears as a whitish deposit, or more prominently as an exostosis; 2. Increased functional activity of bone as revealed by the excessive formation of young haversian canals, composed mainly of osteoid tissue, in the diaphyses of long bones; 3. Development of collagenous fibrils and the formation of new trabeculae therefrom in the costal eppiphyses, and the presence of new and irregularly laid trabeculae in the epiphyses of other long bones; 4. An excessive proliferation of endosteal cells (osteoblasts), giving rise to young haver- sian canals in the diaphyses and syncytial masses of osteoblasts in close apposition with the young trabeculae in the spongiosae. In view of these observations it seems pro- bable that fluorine also stimulates bone forma- tion through osteoblasts in the usual way. The curious but the obvious double reaction of fluo- rine on the osseous tissue may be explained on the assumption that the calcium mobilized from the spongiosa by its calcioprive effect is utilized for the formation of new bony tissue under the influence of its osteogenic property. DISCUSSION The main point for discussion is whether pathologically the condition described in this paper stimulates any known mineral deficiency disease of the bones of cattle. Histologically, we have observed pronounced osteoporosis in certain mobilizable areas of bone, and as accord- ing to Theiler [1934] osteoporosis in cattle represents not a disease in itself, but a stage in the development of rickets or osteomalacia, question arises to what extent this condition resembles osteomalacia. Early European investigators [Bartolucci, 1912; Cristiani, 1925; Askanazy, 1930; Hupka and Götze, 1931] have diagnosed bone changes due to fluorine ingestion in cattle as osteo- malacia without regard to the following points:210 Rickettsia Conjunctivae Coles in Goats scarcely demarcated from the surrounding cellulo-fabrillar masses from which they arise, and (4) the tendency for the formation of syn- cytial masses of osteoblasts in apposition with the newly-formed trabeculae. The whole pic- ture therefore represents a stage in the develop- ment of osteo-sclerosis, which is a characteristic feature of chronic fluorosis in man and rat. The over-production of young haversian tubes in the diaphyses of long bones, seeming to arise from osteoblasts, is also related to endo- steal activity, and here again the same feature of osteosclerosis may be said to predominate. SUMMARY 1. The osseous changes, resulting from a high fluorine (NaF) intake in mature hill bulls kept on a diet adequate in calcium and low in phos- phorus, have been studied, and the gross and microscopical lesions in certain of the bones have been described. 2. In connection with pathogenesis, it is pointed out that the ingestion of fluorine causes only a mild disturbance in Ca and P meta- bolism, due probably to reduced appetite of the animals in an advanced stage of cachexia and consequent inefficient utilization of food. 3. The pathological changes produced, seem to be influenced by the calcioprive and the osteo- genic effects of fluorine. 4. Although osteoporosis of the metaphyses of long bones may be said to represent a stage in the development of the final pathological pic- ture, the lesions do not entirely correspond to classical osteomalacia. Certain hyperplastic changes in the diaphysis and metaphysis of the long bones and ribs indicate endosteal activity and the resulting lesions are more suggestive of osteosclerosis than of osteomalacia.

ABDUSSALAM 211 sheep and a closely allied or identical organism was found by Abdussalam [1942] in smears from the inflamed conjunctiva of buffaloes in Lahore. So far as I have been able to ascer- tain, there is no previous record of the occur- rence of a Rickettsia in the eyes of goats in India. While making a clinical examination of a goat at this college in August, 1942, trachoma-like lesions were noticed on the conjunctival lining of the lids and the nictitating membrane. A Giemsa-stained smear from the lesions showed a heavy infestation of the conjunctival cells with a species of Rickettsia. Twenty-four other goats of the same type were subsequently examined and found to harbour a similar Rickettsia. These goats of the Malvi breed, were purchased in the local market but the herd arrived from South Eastern Punjab and nearby Indian States. Their ages varied from 12 to 15 months. CLINICAL The twenty-five goats showed trachoma-like lesions in both eyes. These consisted of dull- red nodules varying in size from that of a poppy seed to a boiled sago grain. Several of them were confluent and disposed in a band extend- ing along the margins of the lids. Several of the nodules were also present on the nictitating membrane. When the conjunctival surface was gently rubbed with cotton-wool wetted with saline the nodules turned bright-red and with a little more friction began to bleed. The remain- ing conjunctival surface was pale roseate in most cases but rarely showed signs of mild catarrh. In these cases there was an accumu- lation of muco-pus at the inner canthus but in most cases there was nothing but a small quantity of discharge dried along the margins of the eyelid. There was no evidence of keratitis, of impairment of eyesight or of any general illness. Coles [1935] observed 'acute conjunctivitis and keratitis' in one group of cases and 'oph- thalmia' in another. The affection as observed in the Punjab goats is much milder. Possibly, however, these Malvi goats had suffered from a more acute form of the disease in their kid- hood and this had reached a chronic and milder stage by the time they were brought to Lahore. Unfortunately, transmission experiments could not be carried out, as unaffected goats could not be made available; in any case newly-born kids may have to be employed for this purpose. However, it seems reasonable to suppose that the infection is directly transmissible from goat to goat as is the case with a similar affection in other animals (sheep, buffaloes, cattle, etc.). THE RICKETTSIAL ORGANISM Technique of examination. The nodular sur- face of the affected conjunctiva was gently scraped with the edge of a well-ground slide and the material so obtained smeared on another slide and dried in the air. After fixation for one minute in absolute methyl alcohol and dry- ing, it was stained by Giemsa method (one drop of stock stain per c.c. neutral distilled water, for one hour) or with May-Grünwald-Giemsa. With a little practice, the infected conjunctival cells could be easily seen under low power but the organism itself could only be seen with the 1/12 lens. Description of the organism. The organism (Fig. 1) is markedly pleomorphic and one can observe round or avoid solid forms, ring forms, horse-shoe or imperfect ring forms, triangles with accumulated masses of chromatoid mate- rial at the somewhat rounded angles and bipolar form (mostly with asymmetrical sides). The halos in all but the solid forms may not be empty spaces but only chromophobic parts of the protoplasm as observ- ed by Jackson [1931] in the case of Rickettsia ruminantinum Cowdry. There is also a wide variation in the dimensions of the individual elements; at their widest points they were found to measure from 0.5 µ to 1.4 µ . In the material at the writer's disposal the forms with 'halos' (rings, horse-shoes, triangles and bipolars) were relatively more frequent than the solid ones. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1 A schematic drawing of the various forms of Rickettsia conjunctivae of caprine origin. In the conjunctival smears examined 40 to 60 per cent of the epithelial cells were found to be infected. Many of the cells were tightly packed with the organism, while others con- tained a few elements scattered all over the pro- toplasm (Plate XX, figs. 1 and 2) in most of the cells clumps of Rickettsia were seen but they did not show a tendency to hug the nucleus as is the case in conjunctival rickett- siosis of pigs [Unlenhuth and Haendel, 1913] and of man [Heymann, 1913]. Occasionally one finds small clumps of the organism free in
212 Rickettsia Conjunctivae Coles in Goats the smear but this location seems to be due to breaking down of infected cells during the pre- paration of the smear. The organism stains pale-blue or lilac blue with Giemsa. The cnromatoid masses and the 'poles' however, show a reddish hue. With Pinkerton's method as described by Coles [1940] the protista stains light blue. It is gram negative and non-acid-fast. As with conjunctival rickettsiosis of other animals, it was noticed that the heaviness of the infection was directly proportional to the number of neu- trophils in the smear; abundance of these cells always indicated, and was associated with, a heavy infestation of a large number of conjunc- tival cells. It is evident from the above description that the organism encountered in the Punjab goats is identical in its morphological, tinctorial and other characters with the Rickettsia described by Coles [1935] from goats in South Africa. In the present work the causal relationship of the Rickettsia observed to the lesions has been accepted as a working hypothesis. In this con- nection the following recent opinion of Beveridge [1942] may interest the reader. He states that 'although it has not been possible to prove that R. conjunctivae is the cause of con- tagious ophthalmia the circumstantial evidence is so strong that it seems justifiable to accept its causal role as a working hypothesis.' ANOTHER RICKETTSIA-LIKE ORGANISM Coles [1931, a] described what appeared to be another rickettsia-like protista under the heading 'An unknown Intra-cellular organism of the Conjunctival Epithelium of Sheep' from South Africa. The same organism was recorded by Donatien and Lestoquard [1937] in Algeria, but Nanda and Abdussalam (Loc. cit.) did not encounter it in Indian sheep. In goats, Coles [1935] recorded the finding of an identical or a closely allied organism in asso- ciation with the species of Rickettsia described above. I have also encountered this protista in two of the twenty-five goats examined and the findings are briefly reported below: [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. A schematic drawing of the various forms of the second Ricketsia-like organism in the caprine conjuntiva. This organism is not so highly pleomorphic as Rickettsia conjunctivae, the majority of ele- ments being round or ovoid. The other shapes encountered are shown in Fig. 2. In size, it is larger than R. conjunctivae and measures 0.5µ to 1.4µ by 0.4µ to 1.5µ. The organism is essentially intracellular but it is not uncommon to see some free-borne ele- ments near the infected cell which are probably derived from it. There is no tendency towards clumping and the individual elements lie separately and evenly distributed in the cell protoplasm. The number of individuals in an infected cell is relatively much smaller than with R. conjunctivae. (Plate XX, fig. 3). With Giemsa, the organism takes a blue stain which is somewhat deeper than that of R. conjunctivae but is decidedly fainter than that taken by bacteria; there is no reddish tint. As a rule the whole of the protoplasm is not uni- formly stained there being a deeper-stained part arranged more or less in the form of a crescent or a half moon. It has not been possible to make any obser- vations on the pathogenicity of this protista, as on the two occasions on which it was seen, it was associated with R. conjunctivae, and the clinical picture in these goats did not differ from that in the others infected with R. conjunctivae alone. Coles [1935] however, considered it to be the cause of a mild, conjunctival catarrh. SUMMARY 1. A conjunctivitis of goats, associated with Rickettsia, has been recorded apparently for the first time in India. 2. The lesions observed closely resembled those of trachoma and were, perhaps, a sequel of some more acute stages of the affection suffered by the goats during their kidhood. 3. The method of examination and morpho- logy of the causal organism has been described; it seems to be morphologically identical with Rickettsia conjunctivae Coles. 4. Another rickettsia-like organism morpho- logically identical with one described by Coles [1931, a] was also found in two of the goats. Its presence did not seem to add to the patho- genicity of R. conjunctivae with which it was associated. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The writer wishes to express his gratitude to J. S.

Afr. 1, 175-86 214 Generalized Vaccinia in Buffaloes and sensitive and the teats slightly swollen. A large number of papules about the size of a lentil were seen on the teats and udder. Milk from all the four quarters was normal in appear- ance. Papules were also present on the medial aspect of the thighs, tail, quarters, croup, abdo- men, and fore-legs (Plate XXI, figs. 1 and 2). The following day she was greatly depressed, temperature was 104.2oF. and she took no food. Papules had also developed on the chest, neck, head, external surface of the ears and around the nostrils. By the 5th day the papules had developed into vesicles which ultimately became depressed in the centre. The temperature receded to 100.8°F. and the buffalo began to feed. The vesicles gradually increased in size till about the 9th day, attaining the dimensions of a hazel-nut, assuming an elliptical shape on the teats and being circular on the udder and other parts of the body. On about the 10th day the vesicles were converted into pustules, which on some parts of the body such as the abdomen and the legs became confluent, form- ing irregular patches. Gradually all the pustules dried up, forming yellowish scabs which finally changed into thick dark-brown crusts. It was noticed that the vesicles on the teats did not pass through the typical stages of pox, as they were ruptured by the milker during milking, so that the scab stage developed quickly. By the 19th day most of the crusts on the body had become detached, leaving the underlying areas of the skin pinkish in colour and slightly depressed in the centre. The animal was now feeding well and was discharged. The buffalo was again examined on 22 June, 1943. She was then in good condition and the milk yield had returned to normal. Practically all the depress- ed pinkish areas on the skin had disappeared, and the integument was now normal in appear- ance. 2. A black buffalo-cow, age about eight years, calved on 2 April, 1943. The history of the case was that on 28 April, 1943, numerous small pimples had been noticed on the teats and udder and that within four days they appeared on the entire body. She took no food and milk secretion had practically ceased. The buffalo was examined on 6 May, 1943. The pox lesions in this case too developed practically all over the body. The animal recovered after about four weeks, but the vesicles on the teats, which were ruptured during milking, ultimately became indolent ulcers. No permanent pock-marks were seen on the skin. 3. A black Ravi buffalo-cow, age about five years, calved about four months previously, was examined on 6 May, 1943. Pox lesions were present on the teats, udder, medial aspect of the thighs, quarters, vulva, tail, abdomen, chest and around the nostrils. The animal recovered after about three weeks. The depressed areas on the skin gradually disappeared. 4. An aged black Ravi buffalo-cow, calved on 23 March, 1944, was brought to the College Hospital on 19 May, 1944, with the history that five days previously numerous small pimples were noticed on the udder and teats and inside the thighs. They continued to appear on other parts of the body until finally the whole surface was covered. The animal was dull and she neither fed nor ruminated. Milk secretion had much decreased. Two weeks previously the buffalo suffered from rinderpest and had recovered in hospital. The owner mentioned that another buffalo was similarly affected on the adjoining premises, which are situated about three furlongs from the Punjab Vaccine Insti- tute, where small-pox vaccine is manufactured on a large scale. On examination, the buffalo was emaciated, dull and depressed. The tem- perature was 103.8°F., and conjuctivae congest- ed and coated with a mucoid discharge. Papules, the size of a split pea, practically cov- ered the body surface, while on the udder and teats a number of vesicles were also present. The papular, vesicular, pustular and scab stages lasted for about five, four, four and seven days respectively. All the dried crusts except a few on the abdomen, became detached, leaving the udder-lying areas of skin pinkish in colour and slightly depressed at the centre. The animal then looked bright and was feeding and ruminat- ing well, but emaciated. The animal was again examined on 2 August, 1944. She was then in good condition and the depressed areas on the skin, except a few on the chest and abdomen, had practically disappeared. 5. An aged black buffalo-cow, calved on 20 March, 1944. The history as narrated by the owner, was that on 10 May, 1944 small pimples about the size of a split pea were noticed on the teats, udder and inside the thighs and that within three days they became generalized over the body. She was not feeding or ruminating while milk secretion had practically ceased. The buffalo was examined on 19 May, 1944. Vesi- cles with depressed centres were present over the body surface, while on the teats there were a few soft yellowish scabs and on the udder a number of pustules. The vesicles developed into pustules which dried ultimately to dark brown crusts. The animal recovered in about
M. MAQSOOD 215 26 days. Most of the depressed areas on the skin gradually disappeared. COURSE OF THE DISEASE In uncomplicated cases it seems that animals usually recover within three to four weeks. In some cases there have been observed secondary complications such as mastitis, stenosis of the milk ducts and formation of indolent ulcers on the teats etc. and these of course prolong the course of the disease. DIAGNOSIS The occurrence of eruptions on the teats, udder and other parts of the integument, the fact that they passed through the various classi- cal stages of pox, viz. papule, vesicle, pustule and scab, as well as the evidence mentioned in the next section concerning the origin of the infection, may be regarded as giving a clear diagnosis. That being so, no experimental in- oculations on a calf or rabbit were judged to be necessary. A detailed work especially on the characters of the virus is being carried out at this institute. EPIZOOTIOLOGY In India it is probably exceptional for em- ployees who are engaged part-time for milking privately-owned animals to wash their hands before milking each animal. Hence transmission of any disease, such as pox, is easy. In an ordi- nary outbreak of cow-pox the most common source of infection is the importation of new cows, either carrying lesions or in the incuba- tion stage. Blaxall [1930] states that a number of cow-pox outbreaks have occurred after recent vaccination of a milker or attendant who obviously acted as the source of the disease. On the other hand, a common experience has been that the source of outbreaks is not discover- able Ceely [1840] who investigated numerous outbreaks of cow-pox could not determine the origin of infection and concluded that the out- breaks were spontaneous. The following facts were ascertained regard- ing the cases under discussion. Cases Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were tethered side by side during the day under a large shady tree and there was no other cattle in the vicinity. The owner of case No. 2 stated that his children and the servant who looked after the buffalo had been vaccinat- ed against small-pox on 24 April, 1943, i.e. four days before lesions were noticed on the animal. The owner of the case No. 1 had employed a part-time milker, who had also milked buffalo No. 2 which at the time was suffering from generalised cow-pox. The infection in No. 1 is thus readily explained. Case No. 3 evidently contracted vaccinia by direct contact from the diseased buffaloes. At the time of occurrence of cases Nos. 4 and 5 there was an outbreak of small-pox at Lahore and in consequence num- bers of human beings were being vaccinated. The milker who used to milk these two buffaloes had a son who died of small-pox on 15th April, 1944. The milker himself developed a few pustules rather smaller than a split pea on the dorsal surface of the hands between the thumb and the fore-finger and about the wrists. These dried up forming scabs which were removed by him after about 10 days. The source of infec- tion in these two buffaloes is thus also clear. Finally it may be mentioned that other buffaloes were examined in the same locality but none of them was found to be suffering from vaccinia. SUMMARY 1. Five cases of generalized vaccinia in milch buffaloes are recorded, with eruptions develop- ing practically all over the body surface. 2. The general symptoms were more severe and prolonged than those of classical cow-pox, in which the symptoms are benign and the lesions localised. 3. All the cases occurred at a time when num- bers of people were being vaccinated against small-pox and at a time when this disease was prevalent The source of infection in the animals could thus be readily explained.

TRANSMISSION OF RINDERPEST BY EXPIRED AIR By J. A. IDNANI, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 8 March 1944) (With one text-figure) SEVERAL hypotheses have been put forward from time to time to explain the mode of trans- mission of rinderpest under natural conditions, but none accounts satisfactorily for all or most of the observed experimental data. Artificially, the disease is readily inoculable with infected materials by all recognized routes, but it is still doubtful what particular route or whether some combination of routes is respon- sible for the entry of virus into the system under field conditions in natural outbreaks. The highly infectious nature of the disease suggests that rinderpest spreads by contact, but experimental evidence perhaps points to the fact that under natural conditions dissemination may take place through more than one route. Cooper [1932] remarks that "rinderpest spread by direct contact from artificially infected to healthy susceptible cattle at a surprisingly low rate". The role of arthropods as possible transmitting agents in disseminating this disease has been extensively investigated. Curasson [1922] experimented with Ixodes ricinus and with a species of Tabanus. He proved the presence of virus in a tick engorged on an infected animal on the second day of fever by inoculating the macerated tick suspension into a susceptible animal, but when the tick was ground up an hour after removal the virus was inert. With Tabanids the results were negative. Sen [1925] carried out transmission experiments through the agency of Aedes (Stegomyia) albopicta, Musca domestica and Linognathus vituli but the results were entirely negative. Bhatia [1935] employed Tabanus orientes and Stomoxys calcitrans and in one instance he obtained posi- tive results with the former. With the latter species, however, the results were negative. Hornby [1926] made a series of controlled experiments to study the paths of infection. He showed that (a) intact skin is impermeable to virus, while broken skin readily admits it; (b) infection can be set up with virulent blood in- oculated intradermally, subcutaneously intra- venously, or intraperitoneally; (c) the disease is experimentally transmitted through the agency of Glossina morsitans; (d) infection can take place occasionally by ingestion when large quan- tities of infected blood are fed, and (e) infection can be produced by the respiratory tract, viz., by drenching through the nostrils, by intratra- cheal injection or by swabbing the nasal mucous [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Transmission of rinderpest by expired air 216
J. A. IDNANI 217 membrane with infected materials. Hutyra and Marek [1938] suggest that "the infectivity of the expired air is at least questionable". In this paper are described a series of experi- ments to test the infectivity of the expired air of bulls inoculated with rinderpest. METHODS AND MATERIALS To produce optimum conditions under which expired air from an infected animal would be inhaled by a healthy one a wooden trevis was improvised to secure the experimental animals (Fig. 1). At each end a sliding trap door was provided to secure the animals by the neck, so that they could be made to stand facing each other. The neck trap at one end was movable so that the distance between the animals could be adjusted as required. The whole structure was covered with tarpaulin to allow reasonable ventilation. Prior to experimentation, all animals used were trained to stand in the trevis without fidgeting for six hours with an interval of two hours for food and rest. The viruses used were (a) a highly virulent field strain, termed line E, (b) a strain, termed line D of lower virulence and (c) a low virulent goat-adapted strain. Line E was obtained from an outbreak in a Village near Mukteswar in 1939, and it has since been maintained by monthly passage through the medium of spleen tissue collected on the fifth day after inocula- tion. In the interval the virus is stored in the refrigerator. The mortality among hill bulls treated with this strain is over 90 per cent. Line D has been maintained at the Institute for about twenty years and now causes approxi- mately 12 per cent deaths. The goat-adapted strain was evolved at this Institute in 1927 by implantation of rinderpest virus of bovine origin on the foetal tissues of pregnant goats and then recovering from maternal blood. After exposure in the experiments, each bull was kept in a chuppur for individual isolation. The influence of relative humidity as a factor in the transmission of rinderpest by breath was investigated. It was found that the difference between the relative humidity of atmosphere outside and inside the trevis was 10 per cent when a normal bull was exposed; but when a bull infected with the virulent strain was allow- ed to breath for six hours the difference was 6 per cent. With a bull infected with the less virulent strain the difference was 8 per cent. TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS Hall [1935] in a series of tests carried out to campare the virulence of blood with that of nasal secretion taken at the height of temperature found that whereas the mini- mum quantity of blood capable of causing infec- tion at that time was 0.002 c.c., nasal secretion in 1/10th of that amount was infective. At this Institute blood for experimental purposes is taken on the fourth day after inoculation, if the tem- perature reaction is typical. The first transmis- sion experiment was therefore commenced on the fourth day after inoculation. On this day a healthy bull was exposed for three hours to an infected animal at a distance of ten feet. No reaction ensued during the next 13 days. The same animal was then re-exposed to another infected bull on two consecutive days (4 and 5) for four and six hours respectively, the distance between the two being reduced to five feet. Five days after the second exposure a rise in its temperature was recorded and the animal sub- sequently showed symptoms of rinderpest. These experiments showed that rinderpest can be transmitted by the breath and that in the first trial the exposure was too short or the dis- tance too long (Table I). In the next attempt a healthy bull was exposed to an infected animal on the fourth and fifth days for four and six hours respectively at a distance of ten feet. No infection occurred and the healthy bull later proved susceptible to test with virulent blood. This result indicates that the distance between sick and susceptible animals has something to do with the dissemi- nation of cattle plague. At a further trial at a distance of eight feet between a healthy and an infected animal on the fourth day after in- oculation, the disease was not transmitted after an exposure of six hours. After these preliminary trials, an investiga- tion was designed to limit the three factors, viz. stage of fever, period of exposure at which rinderpest can be transmitted through expired air, and distance. As to the stage of fever it is known from many tests with virus-producers that the first rise of temperature occurs on the third day. Healthy bulls were therefore expo- sed218 Transmission of Rinderpest by Expired Air TABLE I Transmission experiments by the breath Expt.

It would appear from Table I that an expo- sure of six hours at a distance of six feet is effective for the transmission of rinderpest by the breath on the fifth and sixth days after artificial infection (Expts. 4J. A. IDNANI 219 reached because no animals infected with the virulent strain of rinderpest virus lived beyond 10 days. An experiment was made to test the role of breath as transmitting agent in a closed atmos- phere without direct transpiration. A hill bull artificially infected with line E rinderpest virus was allowed to breathe in the closed trevis within a length of six feet on the sixth day after inoculation. The infected animal was removed after six hours and a healthy bull was secured in its place and detained for 15 minutes. This animal developed typical rinderpest and died on the 12th day. Less virulent strain The strain used was the line D virus, men- tioned above. The first experiment was com- menced on the fifth day at a distance of six feet, the exposure lasting six hours. The healthy animal so exposed remained unaffected for the next 26 days and was then re-exposed to an infected animal on the sixth day under similar conditions. No reaction ensued during the following 13 days and the animal reacted on test. Evidence confirming these findings was obtained in three other experiments with line D virus. In the first two of these, two healthy bulls were exposed, one on the fifth and one on the sixth days, while a third was exposed daily from the sixth to the ninth day. The exposure in all cases was for six hours at six feet, but no transmission occurred and all experimental animals reacted on test. Goat-adapted strain In view of the large-scale vaccinations against rinderpest being carried out in India with goat vaccine' virus, the infectivity of the expired air of a bull inoculated with goat virus was tried. A healthy animal was exposed to an infected bull daily from the sixth to the ninth day for a period of six hours at a distance of six feet. The disease was not transmitted and the exposed bull later proved susceptible. Similar results were obtained in two more such experiments, although in one case the distance was reduced to four feet. DISCUSSION Certain viral and bacterial diseases of man and animals, such as influenza, tuberculosis, con- tagious pleuropneumonia of bovines and distem- per of dogs, are known to be communicable through the nasal chambers and preventive measures in such diseases primarily consist of segregation of victims. Of the many problems that confront the veterinary worker in the field there is none so important as that of the spread of disease and a thorough knowledge is necessary of the means by which dissemination takes place. In the case of rinderpest, experimental evidence brought out in this paper, shows that expired air of infected animals can play a part in spread and may explain the contact infections recorded in the literature. This finding further- strikes a note of caution to those engaged on researches of a similar nature to avoid vitiation of their experiments by this hitherto unknown route. Such conditions, it must be admitted, as have made it possible to prove the role of breath as a transmitting agent in rinderpest, are perhaps unobtainable in all outbreaks of the disease, but it cannot be denied that in most of the rural areas in India cattle are housed in narrow enclo- sures and through lack of proper understanding of animals hygiene, sick animals are frequently kept together with the rest of farm stock, thus facilitating dissemination of disease. The differing behaviour of the virulent and the two less virulent strains of virus raises the much discussed question of dose and virulence as factors in the successful implantation of a virus on susceptible tissue. The existence of three factors, viz., distance, period of exposure and stage of the infected animal, which determine whether transmission is or is not successful, at any rate in the case of line E virus, supports the view that much diffusion of the infective agent takes place in the air currents between an infected and a healthy animal. The problem of the degree of subinfective dosage required to initiate an infec- tion is worthy of assessment, but for financial reasons even a preliminary test to compare the virulence of line D virus with that of line E virus in terms of minimum infective dose has been withheld for the time. The present small investigation was limited to the question of whether rinderpest can be shown to be easily communicable by the expired air of infected animals. Now that this has been established, the examination of details can be undertaken as facilities permit. Much work has been done to explain airborne infections of man. Thus Dudley [1928], in defining the infective range of droplets expel- led from the nose or mouth, states that some of these droplets are visible and contain many cells and hundreds of bacteria, while others are of microscopical dimensions with only a single cell and one or two bacteria. Heavy particles drop to the ground within two or three feet as the propulsive force of expiratory effort ceases, but smaller droplets may remain suspended for some time according to the atmospheric humidity
220 Studies on the Determination of Digestibility coefficients and temperature and may be carried to almost any distance according to the force and direction of the prevailing air currents. This explains why contact must be fairly close in order to catch an infectious disease. A fine droplet mist, though more persistent, is generally too dilute to do harm. Thus dosage of infective material is an important factor in transmission of air-borne diseases. The effective dose also varies rela- tively and actually with every member of the herd and with every species and strain of bac- teria, because each individual has a special resistance which can deal with particles of the infective agent below a certain minimum but variable number. Most field strains of rinderpest are presumably of a highly virulent nature and are associated with high mortality and their wide prevalence is probably at least partly dependent on such factors as are discussed in this paper. On the other hand, it may be noted that so far there is only one outbreak of rinderpest on recordINDU BHUSAN CHATTERJEE 221 second, and then by assuming that the digesti- bility of the first feed remains constant, the value of the second is computed by difference, i.e., by the method of elimination'. By a similar process the values of the third or fourth feed are obtained. In the experiments conducted by Carbery, Chatterjee and Hye [1934], it was pointed out from actual tests that, when an incomplete fodder like rice straw forms the sole feed, the deficiency of nutrients in it is sometimes so seriously reflected in the animal that the values obtained cannot be valid for use in the calcula- tion, by difference, of the digestibility of asso- ciated feed or feeds. These difficulties prompt ed those authors to design a comprehensive experiment involving 18 individual tests in a randomized cycle order and ultimately working at the values directly by graphical method and by regression equation. While the theoretical background of the method was beyond question, its main difficulty lay in the large numbers of individual tests involving a considerable outlay in men, material, laboratory space and expense. Moreover, the quantity of feed at disposal may not always be sufficient for such an elaborate test. This led to the approach to the problem by a shorter method [Carbery and Chatterjee 1936] in which a simpler formula was worked out on the basis of two individual tests, and the data examined to arrive at a certain mini- mum standard of statistical accuracy. It was found that, with feeds like rice straw and linseed cake, a fair order of accuracy was en- sured with a replication of three to five in the case of the majority of feed components. It is not, however, possible by either of the two methods to abtain the picture which an individual animal may display, or which may sometimes form the special feature in respect to some particular animal or animals. PRESENT METHOD The method described here has originated from these considerations. It aims at adjusting the experimental procedure in such a way that it may be possible to work out the values from the data of a single animal. The fundamental principal involved in calculation is the same, viz. the application of multiple regression equation in which, say, R represents roughage, C represents concentrate, D represents amount digested, while a and b are digestibility co-efficients of R and C respectively.

A slight variation is also inherent between the analytical composition of different days' samples. The amount of air dry cake fed to the ani- mals from day to day was worked out by multi- plying the factor X (each day's respective fac- tor) with the live weight X. The values thus obtained have been set up in column four un- der XY. The corresponding values of cake ni- trogen as ingested from day to day have been obtained from the individual analysis of each day, and have been represented in column six under C. These together with straw nitrogen R and digested nitrogen D form the data final- ly used for regression equation. The results work out as follows: a= 0.3318 ± 0.0702 b= 0.8713 ± 0.17l9 The co-efficients of correlation between the con- secutive day's observation as found by Dr P.V. Sukhatme were as follows: Straw nitrogen . . 0.40 Cake nitrogen . . 0.76 Digestible nitrogen . . 0.76 The last two are significant at 1 p.c. level of probability and suggest that these method of using individual days' values in place of mean of 10 or more days is not without a defect. However, so far as the digestibility values are concerned the values of a and b, as obtained, here show a reasonable order of agreement with the values obtained by the other method. The statistical order of accuracy has not been as satisfactory. This appears to be associated with some complexities inseparable with the basic data. The animals do not work with mathematical precision, and while the variation to this may be a peculiarity inherent with individual ani- mals, the main difficulty lies in respect to the apportionment of the real amount actually fal- ling to the corresponding shares of feeds and faeces. There is at present no satisfactory means by which a correct differentiation of these can be made. Possibly a solution of it can be found in increasing the number of collecting days and then working out on the basis of a certain speci- fied standard as to what should be the minimum number of days compatible with such a stand- ard of statistical accuracy. It is also necessary to state here that much remains to be done to bring the method to con- form to such a strict standard. But, even if it only indicates a partial approximation to it (as in the present case), it will be a definite improvement over the prevailing "method of elimination" in which altogether assumed values have to be used which do not permit of any form of statistical examination. Besides, no other method contemplates the assessment from the performance of single individual animal from a single course of trial.

SESHACHARYULU, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 16 December 1943) ALL the world over, the hygienic quality of market milk is as a rule assessed by its bacterio- logical examination, the methods commonly employed being the plate method for total bacterial count, methylene blue reduction test and presumptive coliform test. Extensive work has been done on this subject by foreign workers under their own conditions of supply and this has enabled the milk controlling authorities there to lay down different standards for the bacteriological grading of market milk supplies. This system of classification and control of the milk supply has not only safeguarded the inter- ests of the consumer but has prevented enor- mous losses to the producer, distributor and manufacturer through the milk going bad. The quality control of market milk in India today covers only its chemical aspect and aims at checking its adulteration. The bacteriologi- cal grading of milk is not in force. The condi- tions of production, handling and distribution being far from satisfactory, the milk industry at present suffers an enormous loss through souring and other causes and the consumer's health may be greatly imperilled. The first step considered necessary, to bring about an improvement in the present state of affairs is the obtaining of information on the bacteriologi- cal quality of milk produced and handled under conditions prevailing in this country. Only a very limited amount of work on the subject has so far been done. Joshi [1916] examined 68 samples of milk collected from city stables and 240 samples drawn at random from dairies, cattle stables, milk hawkers and milk shops in Bombay. He found that the former averaged 17.103.000 and the latter 36,385,000 bacteria per ml. Walton [1925, 1927] examined samples of milk produced at the Pusa Agricul- tural Research Institute Dairy and found that the plate and coliform counts varied with the season of the year, the highest found being during the rainy season. The Imperial Dairy Institute [1939] examined samples of milk pro- duced and handled in its dairy and the results showed that the average plate count per ml. and methylene blue reduction time were 235,000 and four hours respectively. While the work done so far is interesting, it does not provide the material necessary for defining the quality of milk offered for sale in the Indian market on the basis of its bacteriolo- gical condition. The work involved in obtaining material of this kind must of necessity be diffi- cult and considerable, due to various factors, the chief amongst them being the vastness of the country, the conservative methods of pro- duction, handling and distribution of milk, inadequate and difficult transport facilities and the variety of climatic conditions prevailing all over the country. It was therefore felt that information on the quality of milk obtained from different sources was a necessary prelude to further work being done on the subject. The work carried out under this investigation was therefore undertaken. Throughout this investigation the tests employed to determine the bacteriological quality of milk were (a) methylene blue reduction test and (b) the plate count. The work was confined to the condi- tions governing the supply of milk to Bangalore. EXPERIMENTAL The supply of milk to Bangalore is from various sources. The milk sold is either that of cow or buffalo or a mixture of both. The
224 Milk produced under Different Conditions in Bangalore main agencies supplying milk are:H. C. VERMA, ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA AND E. V. SESHACHARYULU 225 Dairy Institute Farm. The houses had tiled roofs, closed sides, kachcha flooring and poor drainage. Well water was used for watering the animals and for cleaning purposes. The cattle houses were merely swept; the manure was allowed to lie nearby. Ordinary vessels were used for milking and handling of the milk and their cleaning done by the indigenous method. The animals were washed occasional- ly in most cases, their feeding was done during milking and milking was performed in an un- clean manner. Samples of bulked milk were taken for examination. Each sample represent- ed the production of about 20 animals. (vii) Domestic cows. The udders of the cows were washed with tap water. After the calves had been sucked, milking was done in brass vessels with small openings. Clean- ing of the milking vessels was done by scouring with ash and mud, rinsing out with water and finally draining and drying them in shade. The vessels were rinsed out with the tap water before use. Samples for examination were taken from the milking vessels on comple- tion of each milking. In this work samples of only morning produc- tion and supply were taken. The atmospheric temperatures at the time varied from 75°F. to 85°F. Although the Imperial Dairy Institute sells pasteurized milk, samples of only raw milk before pasteurization were examined to compare the quality obtainable under farm conditions with the other sources of supply. All the samples, other than those taken at the Imperial Dairy Institute cattle yard and dairy, were brought to the laboratory in ice boxes and exa- mined, within about half an hour of sampling, for Methylene Blue Reduction time and bacterial count. The Methylene Blue Reduc- tion test was performed according to Wilson's modified technique [1935] and the bacterial count was determined by the plate method using milk agar as recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture [1934]. A total of 1340 samples taken, both from the production and supply ends was examined. The results obtained are given in Tables I and II respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the tests with the samples at production (Table I) show that, under the condi- tions obtainable on the Imperial Dairy Institute Farm (representing standard dairy farm condi- tions), a majority of the milk samples (86.72 per cent.) of individual cows and buffaloes con- tained under 50,000 bacteria per ml. This also included a very large proportion of samples giving under 25,000. The majority of herd samples (cow and buffalo) contained between 25,000 and 100,000 bacteria per ml. The pro- portions of cow herd samples giving a count below and above 100,000 were 91.05 per cent. and 8.92 per cent. and of buffalow herd samples 84.05 per cent and 15.92 per cent respectively. All samples of domestic cows gave count upto 100,000 bacteria per ml. except for one sixth of the total number which gave between 100,000 and 200,000. No sample of milk from town milk stables contained below 100,000 bacteria per ml. A little more than half of the total number of these had between 200,000 and. 500,000 and the remaining between 500,000 and 5 millions bacteria per ml. The majority of village milk samples contained between 500,000 and 10 millions bacteria per ml. and only about one-sixth of the total number had between 200,000 and 500,000. The methylene blue reduction times of 88.66 per cent. of the samples of individual cows and buffaloes was about 330 min. (5½ hr.) and of this over half the number were above 420 min. (7 hr.). The remaining were decolourized between 329 and 240 min.

228 Milk produced under Different Conditions in Bangalore On the supply side (Table II) 56.29 per cent. of the cow and buffalo milk samples drawn from the Imperial Dairy Institute dairy showed between 50,000 and 200,000 bacteria per ml., including a large proportion between 100,000 and 200,000. The remaining showed between 200,000 and 500,000 bacteria per ml. Taken separately the proportions of cow milk samples below and above 200,000 bacteria per ml. were 54.66 per cent and 45.33 per cent and of buffalo milk samples 58.72 per cent, and 41.66 per cent respectively. A majority of samples of travelling milch cows (74.08 per cent) was below 200,000 bacteria per ml. including a large proportion below 100,000. Of the remain- ing samples, a negligible number was between 500,000 and 1 million bacteria per ml. Very few samples of milk hawkers showed between 200,000 and 500,000 bacteria per ml., the majority falling between 500,000 and 1 million and an appreciable number between one and five millions bacteria per ml. All the samples of town dairies contained above one million bacteria per ml., 71.29 per cent of the samples having between 1 and 10 millions and the re- maining above 10 millions. The highest record ed was about 92 millions. The methylene blue reduction times of a majority of samples drawn from the Imperial Dairy Institute dairy were between 240 and 329 min. (45½ hr.). The remaining were above 329 mm. except the one sample which decolourized between 180 and 239 min. (3-4 hr.). Almost the same results were obtained with the samples of travelling milch cows. The majority of samples of milk hawkers decolourized between 60 and 179 min. (1-3 hr.) and the reduction times of the remaining were between 180 and 239 min. (3-4 hr.); only one sample decolourized within 60 min. The reduction times of all the samples of town dairies were below 119 min. the majority decolourizing within 60 min. A very small number of samples fell between 120 and 179 min. (2-3 hr.). The above results as judged on the basis of a majority of samples of each class show consider- able differences in the bacteriological quality of milk occurring under the different conditions of production and supply. A general comparison is given in Table III. TABLE III Source Bacterial count per ml. Methylene blue reduction time Production (1) Imperial Dairy Institute FarmH. C. VERMA, ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA AND E. V. SESHACHARYULU 229 is a fair amount of general correlation between the plate counts and reduction times of the same samples of individual cows and buffaloes at the Imperial Dairy Institute, marked dis- crepancies occur in other cases. The latter position is clearly brought out in Table IV in which, samples showing different plate counts have been arranged with their respective reduction times. It will be seen that, on the production side, out of the total of 662 samples TABLE IV Bacterial counts per ml. of milk.

On the supply side 139 samples gave plate counts of 200,000 and below, of which only 49 (35.25 per cent) had reduction times of 330 min. and over and 90 (64.75 per cent) fell between 240 and 329 min. Similar observations have been made by other workers. Malcolm and Renwick [1936] observ- ed that a considerable proportion of milk samples which attained the Grade A* standard according to plate count reduced methylene blue within 5 hr. On the other hand many samples which could be classed as Grade A on the basis of reduction time fell out on account of plate count. Thomas and Tudor [1937] also observed discrepancies. Nichols and Edwards [1936] found that samples giving counts of over one million per ml. reduced methylene blue within two hours. Recently, Kudelka [1941] observed a positive correlation; samples of milk showing 50,000 bacteria per ml. reduced the dye in about 5½ hr., while samples containing over one million decolourized it in about 30 min. Those between these extremes gave inter- mediate reduction times. The results obtained in this work are different from the findings of Kudelka, but they fall in line with the observa- tions of Nichols and Edwards, to some extent, as a majority (161 out of 231) of samples showing plate counts of over one million reduced methylene blue within two hours.

CHAUDHURY 231 showed short chains of streptococci. By cul- tural examination it was proved that five of the seven cases were associated with haemo- lytic streptococci which fermented salicin and trehalose, but not lactose and mannitol, thus resembling Edwards' Type B1 or Bazeley's Type 4. TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS 1. With blood Blood drawn at the height of temperature from three cases, Nos. 5, 6 and 7 of the series, two of which subsequently had parotid abs- cesses, were injected subcutaneously into a foal, No. 499, aged four months. Apart from a sudden and transient rise of temperature (to 103.4°F.) 14 days after the first injection, there were no symptoms. Blood transmission was also carried out from the experimentally-infected foal with negative results, the blood at this time showing no bac- teria in culture. 2. With culture A 24-hour broth culture of streptococci, isolated during this outbreak, was sprayed into the nostrils of foal 499, 21 days after the last blood injection. Four days later, there was a definite rise in temperature associated with nasal discharge and swelling of the submaxil- lary region. This swelling was hard and painful and gradually spread over the face, especially on the left side. Metastatic abscesses then appeared over the submaxillary, parotid and pharyngeal regious, abscess forma- tion being fully developed within nine days, when the temperature rose to 105.6° F. The abscesses were opened on that day and dressed antiseptically. It took nearly four weeks before the animal was declared cured. IMMUNITY TEST For this purpose cases 5, 6 and 7 and the artificially infected foal 499 were used. A 24- hour culture of streptococci, isolated during the outbreak was sprayed into the nostrils, a healthy foal No. 512 being included as control. During an observation period of three weeks, there was no sign of the disease in the recover- ed animals, while the control foal developed from the 3rd day a temperature which gradu- ally rose to 104.6° F. on the 7th day and per- sisted for a week, when thick creamy discharge from the right nostril was present. This dis- charge on microscopical and cultural examina- tion yielded haemolytic streptococci. The control foal was left untreated but developed no further symptoms. From the above observations, it is seen that the incubation period in the two artificially - infected animals (foals 499 and 512) was three to four days. The immunity test revealed that animals which had once suffered from the disease, naturally or artificially acquired, attained a strong immunity lasting for at least four months. To test the duration of immunity, the same strains of streptococci maintained for a year in culture media were used on healthy as well as on recovered ponies. None of these animals got the disease, indicating that the bacteria had lost its virulence. An attempt at exalting the virulence by rabbit passage was unsuccessful. DISCUSSION In this small outbreak only adult animals were at risk, but in three of the seven affected the lesions were those of typical strangles. In this connection it may be noted that the ponies had lived a relatively isolated existence in the Kumaun hills and had only rarely been in close contact with other equines. Their susceptibility would therefore be high. Experi- mentally, it is interesting to note that a clinical attack of strangles was readily set up in foais by means of a streptococcus culture. Bazeley [1943] found that positive results could only be obtained with certainty by using a very young (4½ hr.) culture, but in this work there was no difficulty in setting up the disease in young foals with a 24-hour culture of an early generation. SUMMARY 1. An account is given of a small outbreak of strangles in adult ponies, associated with haemolytic streptococci of Edwards' type B1 or Bazeley's equine type 4. 2. Blood of affected animals taken at the height of fever was non-infective, but strangles in its typical form was easily set up experi- mentally in foals by nasal installation of a 24- hour brooth culture of the streptococcus. 3. Naturally and experimentally infected animals were proved to be immune. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors acknowledge their thanks to Mr. J. R. Haddow for encouragement and to Mr. V. R.

THE COMPOSITION OF PRE-MILK AND COLOSTRUM OF DAIRY COWS OF THE PEDIGREE SAHIWAL HERD AT THE IMPERIAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, NEW DELHI* By S. K. MUKHERJEE, K. SWAMINATHAN and B. VISWANATH Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi (Received for publication on 1 November 1943) ONE of the practices in the management of the Sahiwal Herd at this Institute is to premilk heifers and cows about to calve. It is usually done for a period of 5 to 15 days before the animals are due to calve. The milk thus obtained is called premilk; it is yellowish in colour and thick. It is not mixed with the normal milk, but is used in the feeding of calves. Two or three instances occurred in which heifers began to develop udders and to yield milk, even before they were put to the bull. The quantity of the premilk ranged from 5 to 15 lbs. per day. An instance is that of heifer No. 769 which was born on 18th March 1936 and was put to the bull on 29th June 1938. This heifer was giving milk even before she was put to the bull. The milk resembled normal milk in physical appearance. In chemical com- position also it was similar to normal milk as can be seen from the analytical data given in Table I.

This heifer began to give from the 5th or the 6th month of gestation secretions which were in all appearance like normal milk and analysed like normal milk, as can be seen from the results given in Table I above. These milks were submitted to nutrition tests by Dr R. K. Pal, a medically qualified and experienced officer stationed at the Institute as Liaison Officer between Human Nutrition and Agricultural Research. He carried out experi- ments with rats and a large number of boys in the Estate and found that this abnormal milk was in no way deficient in composition and nutritive value. It was, therefore, of interest to ascertain the chemical composition of the premilk i.e., milk obtained a few days before calving, as a preli- minary to the starting of further investigations. From the available literature on the subject, it is seen that the investigations were along two main linesS. K. MUKHERJEE, K. SWAMINATHAN AND B. VISWANATH 233 EXPERIMENTAL The analyses were carried out during the period 10 June, 1938 to 21 September, 1938. Samples of milk were received from cows of the pedigree herd of Sahiwal of the Institute. Particulars of the animals whose secretions were analysed are given in Table II.

They were imme- diately taken to the laboratory for analysis and were shaken properly before each pipetting. Total solids, ash, casein, lactose and acidity were estimated according to the A. O. A. C. methods of analysis [1935]. Fat was estimated by Gerber's H2SO4234 Composition of Pre milk and Colostrum of Dairy Cows The fat percentage is definitely low in pre- milk. It increases gradually at first rising abruptly on the day of calving or the following day. Afterwards there is sometimes a sudden rise but usually a somewhat lower value is obtained after about two to three days; it then remains almost constant. In two or three cases, the fat percentage of premilk is somewhat high, but it gradually falls as premilking pro- ceeds until the day of calving when it rises again. Generally a high value for the acidity of colo- strum and premilk was observed, which gra- dually diminished to the low value of normal milk. The maximum acidity of premilk was 0.63 and minimum 0.20, but the normal value was about 0.25. Lactose content of premilk is very low and in certain cases it was too low to estimate. The gradual increase in the lactose content probably indicates that the animals, as they advance in pregnancy, synthesize this product for the pro- geny. The final value is almost the same in all cases. Proteins comprise the most important item in the whole analysis. It has been observed that protein content decreases as secretions are drawn starting from premilk or colostrum to TABLE III Heifer No. No. of days pre- milked Before calving After calving Before calving After calving Initial analysis Just before calving Just after calving Normal milk Initial analysis Just before calving Just after calving Normal milk Variation in total solids Variation in sp. gravity 763 14 24.2 14.0 18.4 15.3 . . . . . . . . 771 3 18.6 16.4 20.1 15.9 . . 1.047 1.038 1.028 772 5 13.5 16.6 21.3 18.5 1.031 1.032 1.029 . . 773 1 24.3 . . 34.8 13.1 1.063 . . 1.044 1.037 Fat Lactose 763 14 0.9 3.5 9.5 5.2 2.6 4.2 3.8 4.4 771 3 2.8 1.6 9.1 7.3 2.9 3.2 3.1 4.1 772 5 3.2 4.2 5.6 7.1 3.8 3.0 3.2 4.1 773 1 2.4 . . 7.1 6.8 3.0 . . 3.4 3.6 Acidity Ash 763 14 0.33 0.32 0.29 0.28 . . . . . . . . 771 3 0.43 0.43 0.43 0.27 0.82 0.83 0.76 0.78 772 5 0.28 0.28 0.41 0.27 0.66 0.76 0.69 0.75 773 1 0.52 . . 0.63 0.26 0.93 . . 0.82 0.74 Total protein Casein 763 14 16.0 4.7 4.4 4.0 2.4 3.3 3.1 3.0 771 3 10.3 8.1 8.8 3.6 4.3 2.9 4.5 3.0 772 5 3.7 3.9 3.5 3.5 3.5 2.5 2.4 2.7 773 1 13.5 . . 8.9 3.6 5.0 . . 4.2 3.5 Albumin Globulin 763 14 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 771 3 1.6 1.1 1.4 0.28 4.4 3.1 2.9 0.39 772 5 0.23 0.49 0.24 0.13 Nil. 0.92 0.83 0.62 773 1 1.8 . . 1.2 Nil. 6.7 . . 3.5 0.04 Albumin and globulin Coagulation test 763 14 13.6 1.4 1.3 1.0 . . 80 80 no 771 3 6.0 4.2 4.4 0.67 . . 35 45 no 772 5 0.23 1.41 1.07 0.75 30 60 50 no 773 1 8.5 . . 4.7 0.04 20 . . 40 no

This decrease is due to the re- duction of two of the proteins, viz., albumin and globulin, and especially of the latter. Only in some cases the protein content shows an abrupt rise immediately after calving, but this is far from a general occurrence. In cases where premilking has been done the protein content scarcely shows increase but where pre- milking has not been done at all, or only two or three days before parturition, the protein con- tent is usually high but shows no further rise (see below). Casein content does not vary much for the different animals and shows no transitional change. Even when the total protein is high the casein content remains almost unaltered. Globulin content remains at a high level in premilk; it then gradually diminishes. Occa- sionally, a rise in the globulin content may be observed in the colostrum, but if premilking is done for a long time the chance of such a rise is negligible. When no secretion is drawn before calving the globulin content of colostrum is considerably high, and abruptly drops to a low value on the day following calving. In such cases the total solids, fat, specific gravity and acidity may also be high. Two such cases are enumerated below in Table VII.

238 Composition of Pre-milk and Colostrum of Dairy Cows Ash content varies slightly for the different cows. It is only somewhat higher in colostrum and premilk than in ordinary milk. The specific gravity of premilk and colostrum is generally somewhat higher than that of nor- mal milk. These high values are parallel with the high viscosity of the secretions. Variations of the different constituents from animal to animal are better correlated with the period of "drying" than with the age of the animals or other characteristics. The range of variations of some important constituents is given in Table VIII from which it would appear that the range is not much different for the different animals but the absolute values are dependent upon the length of time the animals have been kept "dry". The length of the drying period has been calculated from Table II as the difference between the figures given in columns 5 and 6.

FLUOROSIS OF CATTLE IN THE MADRAS PRESIDENCY By G. R. VISWANATHAN, G.M.V.C., Veterinary Investigation Officer, Madras (Received for publication on 26 March 1943) (With Plate XXII) IN 1934-35 the writer recorded the existence of a disease which on clinical ground he described as chronic rheumatic arthritis in cattle in cer- tain villages of Kurnool district. Since then the condition has been reported from other districts and the present article includes an account of the disease as observed in cattle in the Madras Presidency. The disease is locally known in Telugu districts as Voyupotlu or Voyunoppulu (Voyu= Rheumatism, Potlu or Noppulu = pains) and in Tamil as Keelvoyu (Keel=joint and Voyu= Rheumatism). OCCURENCE AND SYMPTOMS This disease occurs in several villages of various taluks of Kurnool, Anantapur, Cuddapah and Nellore districts, the endemic regions being adjacent to Hyderabad State where this disease is also prevalent. The endemic areas of the Madras Presidency lie on the borders of the Nallamalais range, situated on one side of the Kurnool district and divided by the Thunga- badra and Kistna rivers. The disease generally affects breeding bulls. working bullocks and cows. Calves and buffaloes suffer only occasionally (Plate XXII, fig. 1). Few cases have been observed in sheep, but none in other domestic animals. Amongst cattle the condition has been observ- ed more frequently in Ongole breed of cows in milk and bullocks at work kept under stall- feeding condition. Number of cases have been observed in cows during lactation period and after their first calving. Only two cases have been observed in sheep, both of which were handfed. Animals of the Ongole breed appear to be more susceptible than others; Mysore, Alambadi, and in certain villages 5 to 10 per cent of cattle of this breed might be found affected. The conditions is rare in young animals and a few cases only have been recorded in suckling calves. Cases of the disease may be observed through- out the year, but the symptoms appear to be more marked during the ploughing season and at the commencement of rains. The history given by the owners is that the animals purchased when young, get the affection one or two years after their arrival in the endemic area. The first indication of this condition is lameness in one or more limbs, more often the forelimbs, and more particularly in the shoul- ders, which appear to be thrown forward. The lameness is usually a constant feature, generally obscure and progressive in nature and metastatic in character. In about six months to a year from the onset of lameness, the animal shows stiffness of gait, evinces pain while walking, and finds difficulty in arching its back. Later on the animal shows extreme emacia- tion due to atrophy of muscles all over the body, experiences difficulty in lying down and getting up and finally remains recumbent. The hoofs are found twisted, distorted and over grown, the digits having a tendency to separate, and the points of the toes frequently curving inwards. Skeletal abnormalities are manifested by swollen joints and exostoses over the long bones and the jaw. These appear as hard, bony en- largements on the medial and lateral aspects of the joints and the bones giving them a thickened or deformed appearance. In very severe cases, the pasterns becomes affected with even anky- losis of the joints so that the limbs present a club-shaped appearance, causing marked lameness and a peculiarly stiff gait. Calluses are noticed on the prominent bones and the ribs. These occur in the form of nodular elevations on the middle of the ribs in a lengthwise manner on one or both sides and range in size from a walnut to a hen's egg. The animal feels pain over the exostosis. In certain endemic areas the affected animals show discoloration of teeth, with brownish pig- mentation and mottling, and even chipping off at places. In the early stage of the disease animals feed normally, but later the appetite becomes im- paired, coat becomes harsh and rugged, emacia- tion advances and death ensues. In young stock, growth remains poor in spite of good feeding. Other symptoms include lowered fertility, de- layed oestrum, sterility reduction in milk yield 239
240 Fluorosis of Cattle in the Madras Presidency and in some instances photophobia. The course of this disease runs from a few months to a few years, but in buffaloes the duration is shorter. POST MORTEM FINDINGS Due to religious sentiments of the people the writer had some difficulty in getting affected animals for destruction and post mortem exami- nation. An opportunity was, however, availed for examining post mortem of two animals destroyed in extremis in a very badly affected village. In both, the internal organs appeared to be normal and the lesions were confined to the skeleton only. The following is the pro- tocol of post mortem findings. Case No. 1. The hip and shoulder joints were severely inflammed, metatarsal bone and the knee joints showed bony exostosis and diffuse periostitis and the nodular prominences present on the ribs were porous in character. The median suture in the skull showed a tendency to give way and the mandibles of the lower jaw were disunited at the symphysis. The epiphysis of the left humerus had the tendency to separate from the proximal end and those of the radius and ulna at their distal ends. The cancellated tissue in the interior of the long bones was found infiltrated with a lardacious material. Case No. 2. Of the ribs examined, one showed partial fracture about its middle at two places and another showed the two fractured ends, one riding over the other with callus for- mation around them. None of the long bones showed any exostosis but numerous obsteo- phytes were found on the non-articular surface of one of the ospedis bones. The cancellated tissue of the long bones showed infiltration with lardacious material. ETIOLOGY AND EPIZOOTIOLOGY In this rheumatic affection of cattle, the etio- logical factors likely to be considered are (1) in balance of diet with regards to its mineral contents (2) deficiency of phosphorus (3) defi- ciency of vitamins and (4) fluoride poisoning. From investigations carried out by the Gov- ernment Agricultural Chemist, Coimbatore on samples of pasture grass from affected and healthy areas, it has been shown [Ramiah. 19411 that the former contains a high Ca and low P and the latter normal values for these minerals. Similarly, 14 samples of other fodders sent to the same worker for analysis revealed a striking unbalance with regard to these minerals. Again, a survey of pastures of Malabar and Kurnool districts carried out by the Government Agricultural Chemist showed a shortage, if not the actual deficiency of these minerals. In the former district both CaO and P2O5 were low, whereas in the latter a shortage of P2O5only was revealed. The deficiency of P in the pasture leads to lowering of inorganic P value of blood, and in order to obtain further evidence regarding the etiological significance of this factor, blood samples from affected and normal animals were analysed by the Government Agricultural Che- mist, Coimbatore with the result that whereas in the latter Ca and P both showed a normal value, in the former, P content was found to be low. In certain number of cases the P value was found to be below 1 mg. per 100 c.c. of blood. Blood samples sent from Madras cases for analysis at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, showed no variation from normal; but those sent from Hyderabad, where a similar disease occurs, proved deficient in P. Vitamin A deficiency was suspected to play a part in causation of this disease as the number of cases are less in the rainy season when the animals usually ingest plenty of green fodder. Analysis of well water and soil samples from certain affected localities have revealed the pre- sence of fluorine in a concentration higher than the amount present in those of healthy areas. Representative rocks and soils of an area stretching from Kurnool division to Markapur revealed on analysis a high content of fluorine. According to the Govt. Agricultural Chemist, Coimbatore [Ramiah, 1938-39] the Cuddapah- Kurnool system of sedimentary rocks shows a high flourine content, ranging up to 960 part per million or about 500 times that of well water. Work carried out at the King Institute of Pre- ventive Medicine. Guindy, show that the highest fluorine concentration is to be found to lie in the narrow belt of granitoid rocks stretch- ing north. north-east from south of Kanigiri. Nellore and to the Krishna river near Amrawati in Guntur. The presence of fluorides in high toxic quantities in certain areas, especially North Nellore and isolated places in Cuddapah and Anantpur has also been noticed. Analysis of well water samples by the Govt. Agricultural Chemist [Ramiah, 1938-39] reveals a flourine content ranging from 0.5 to 2 parts per million in samples from the affected areas, and a little or none from those of healthy ones. Table I shows the fluorine content of water samples collected from various Talukas in four endemic areas of the Presidency:

In one village of Nellore district the stream water was found to contain 13.85 p. p. m. of fluorine. The analysis of water from certain 'curative' villages has revealed a flourine content less than 0.5 p. p. m. Increased diuresis and pronounced pathologi- cal changes in kidney suggested that the high concentration of fluorine ingested with water had some deliterious effect on this organ when passed through urine, but twelve samples of urine sent for the detection of fluorine at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izat- nagar, revealed nothing of significance. Samples of teeth from the affected animals were analysed at this Institute with the results quoted below. The material forwarded by you has been anlysed for their fluorine content which appears to be somwhat higher than that in normal calves as reported by some Western workers...... Field investigations reveal that there might be several factors, all exercising their effects on the etiology, occurrence and the progress of the disease. The endemic areas are known to be related to certain type of rock formation im- parting to the soil, water and the herbage a higher concentration of fluorine and a state of unbalance with regard to Ca and P. When the affected animals are removed to certain "cura- tive'' villages where these soil and herbage abnormalities do not exist, they develop freedom from the disease. Although it is not unlikely that the animals in these localities suffer from a mild form of hypophospherosis, certain epizootological factors suggest that the condition described in this paper may be looked upon as fluorine intoxica- tion. These are (1) spontaneous cure of clinical cases when removed to certain "curative" villages, where the soil, herbage and water con- tains a normal amount of fluorine, (2) the pre- sence of mottling and brown pigmentation toge- ther with the chipping tendency of enamel of teeth. This feature is characteristic of human fluorosis, (3) in cattle enzootic areas of this disease in the Presidency human beings are also known to suffer from skeletal and dental abnormalities as described by Shrott et al [1937]. TREATMENT So far any form of treatment has not been found effective in advanced cases of the disease although cases in early stage are amenable to treatment. Mention has already been made of certain "curative" villages where the general practices are paddy cultivation, irrigation from tanks and less ground-nut cultivation. Animals, when taken to these villages during early stage of the disease, show gradual improvement with- out any treatment. This is attributed to a change over from a brackish water to rain or soft water of these villages. (a) Curative. During the year 1934-35, Mahajan, in Hyderabad, treated some cases with sterilized bone meals and reports encouraging results as no further cases occurred when he visited the same tract again after five months. He advocated this treatment both as curative and preventive. In this Presidency, bone-meal was first tried in Joladarsi village of Koilkuntla Taluk in Kurnool district in the year 1934-35. The affected animals were given each one ounce of bone-meal per day for six months and com- plete recovery was observed in two animals thus treated. On another occasion, seven animals in Cuddapah and thirteen in Kurnool district were treated with bone-meal given in doses of two ounces daily to each animal. As a result of this treatment in about two months from the admi- nistration of bone-meal, the animals in the early stage of the disease showed rapid improvement. In well-advanced cases with marked anatomical
242 Protein for Egg Production abnormalities such as bony exostoses etc. the bone-meal feeding relieved them of acute symp- toms like lameness and painful joints, but had a very little effect in reducing the exostoses. The duration of the treatment is long and marked improvement is noticed after a course of treatment lasting from six months to one or two years. When the treatment with bone- meal is discontinued on finding improvement in condition, there is a possibility of relapse, hence affected animals in enzootic areas require treat- ment as long as they live. (b) Preventive. Prophylactically the bone- meal may be recommended for supplementing the diet of cattle grazing on deficient pasture, as it would not only prevent the disease, but also improve the rate of growth of young stock. Moreover the bone-meal fed animals have got a tendency to maintain the advantage during the seasons when the grazing is generally poor. The Government Agricultural Chemist recom- mends the addition of lime to the water of the wells in affected localities, as this process re- duces the fluorine content of the water. SUMMARY 1. This disease in cattle known as Voyo potlu locally, was first observed in Madras Presidency in 1934-35 in Kurnool district. Since then its incidence has been known in certain villages of Nellore and Cuddapah districts around the hills, being related to the condition of the soil, pasture, foodstuffs and water and the nature of the pre- vailing agricultural practices. 2. There is no seasonal incidence. The disease runs a chronic course affecting 5 to 10 per cent of cattle population in an enzootic area. One peculiarity about the disease is that while its incidence is heavy in one village, the neigh- bouring village may be free from it. 3. The main etiological factor is the presence of fluorine in an abnormal amount in soil. pastures and the water, followed by aphospho- rosis and vitamin deficiency. 4. The main feature of the disease is the pre- sence of exostosis on the ribs and the joints, and overgrowth and deformity of hoofs. Frac- tures and ulcerations of articular heads and a few bony prominences are the characteristic lesions on post mortem examination. 5. There is no complete or successful treat- ment in advanced cases. In early stages treat- ment is only palliative. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to express my great gratitude to Major G.

Indian Fmg. 2, 634 PROTEINS FOR EGG PRODUCTION, II By A. J. MACDONALD, Officer-in-charge, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 9 March,-1944) PREVIOUS experiments carried out by Macdonald and Bose [1943] demonstrated that a cereal ration containing 10.4 per cent protein gave poor egg production, even when supplemented with common salt and liberal amounts of green food and calcium. The addition of vegetable proteins, such as soya bean meal and earthnut meal, to the cereal rations had no beneficial effect, but supplements of separated milk and meat offal on the other hand markedly improved egg production. In view of the importance of these results another experiment was designed to throw more light on several other aspects of the work. In this experiment all the birds
A. J. MACDONALD 243 were fed wet on mash, whereas in the previous experiment all the groups, except that on meat offal, were fed on dry mash. Comparisons were made between separated milk and meat offal supplements (intestines of animals from the slaughter house) and low protein cereal diets with and without salt supplements. EXPERIMENTAL Stock. A total of 200 six to seven month old White Leghorn X Rhode Island Red pullets were divided into four comparable groups and fed on the experimental rations for a period of 280 days. The groups were housed under similar conditions and had access to large grass runs. All the birds were trapnested throughout the experiment. Feeding. The four groups were fed on mash and grain rations. The basal mash fed to all groups consisted of wheat bran 50 parts, yellow maize meal 30 parts and ground oats 20 parts. The grain ration consisted of a mixture of equal parts of yellow cracked maize, wheat and paddy. Broken limestone and water were fed ad libitum, together with liberal amounts of succu- lent green food. Group I (Basal Group) was fed the basal diet only. Group II (Salt Group) received the basal diet plus 1 per cent common salt in the mash. Group III (Milk Group) received the basal mash supplemented with 0.5 per cent common salt and approximately 5 oz. of sepa- rated milk per bird per day. Group IV (Meat offal Group) received the basal mash supple- mented with 1 per cent common salt and 1.2 oz. of meat offal per bird per day. All four groups received wet mash according to appetite at 7-30 A.M. The amount fed varied according to appetite, the usual amount being about 1.2 oz. of dry mash per bird. The mash was fed in a crumbly state, and the amount fed was limited to what the birds would readily consume in 10 to 15 minutes. The wet mash for Groups I and II was made up by adding water only. The mash for Group III was mixed with separated milk instead of water and the balance of the milk ration for the day was fed ad libitum in a top-filling fountain. Group IV re- ceived the mash mixed with meat offal. The meat offal required for the group was weighed out and cooked in a small quantity of water for a period of one hour. The offal was then run through a mincing machine and mixed with the mash. The residual water from the cooking was also mixed into the mash. About 0.5 oz. of grain per bird was fed to each of the groups at 10 A.M. Dry mash was also given in waste-proof hoppers from 12 noon until 4 P.M. Grain according to appetite (approxi- mately 1½ oz. per bird) was given to each of the groups at 5 P.M. All the four groups received water to drink but Group IV also received the balance of their separated milk ration in drinking vessels. In order to ensure a complete con- sumption of the milk, the water vessel was removed from the milk group at the time of feeding the milk and replaced when the milk was finished. All the foods consumed were regularly analysed, and every effort was made to keep the protein percentages in Groups III and IV at a constant level. Over the whole experi- ment, the average percentage protein in the basal mash was 10.4. The corresponding figure for the grain mixture was 9.7 per cent. The separated milk contained 9.7 per cent dry matter and 3.5 per cent protein. The corresponding figures for the meat offal were 18.0 and 122. Egg production.

The egg produc- tion figures for Groups III and IV were fairly comparable in all periods, except period 3 when the production in Group IV fell on account of moulting. Group III laid consistently better than Groups I and II. Group IV also laid better than Groups I and II in each period, except period 3.

Technique of making sperm counts ARTIFICIAL insemination comprises the intro- duction of spermatozoa into the female repro- ductive tract by means of instruments, so that direct contact between male and female animals for breeding is unnecessary. The modern method was first developed in Russia, where it is now practised extensively in horse, cattle and sheep breeding. It has also been used with success in most European countries, and in the U.S.A., the British Colo- nies and elsewhere. 1. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF THE PRACTICE IN CATTLE BREEDING IN GREAT BRITIAN In this country artificial insemination has been practised only on a very limited scale. Nevertheless it has several possible applica- tions, which can be summarized under two headings247 free from vaginal secretions and uncontamina- ted by extraneous matter, can be expeditiously collected. The Russian model A.V. consists of a hard rubber cylinder, about 24 inches long, into which is fitted a soft rubber tube or lining, slightly thicker than the inner tube of a bicycle tyre. The ends of the soft tube are turned back on the ends of the outer hard tube and fixed in position by binding with half-inch cotton tape. The outer tube has a hole, fitted with a screw stopper, through which water can be poured into the space between the outer and inner tubes, the amount of water being adjusted to give the correct tension on the inner lining A glass cup with a graduated stem fits into one end of the A.V. and forms a receptacle for the semen. In assembling the apparatus care must be taken to ensure that this cup is firmly secured, otherwise it may be dislodged when the bull thrusts into the vagina. This is especially liable to happen if there is too much water in the A.V. When assembling the apparatus care must be taken to ensure that the inner lining and all glassware are kept clean and dry. Before hand- ling the apparatus, the operator's hands should also be clean and dry, and without trace of soap or disinfectant. For filling the A.V., water is heated to about 70° C. (160° F.) in winter and 60° C. (140° F.) in summer, and then poured into the space be- tween the rubber liner and the cylinder. Estimation of the correct degree of tension in the apparatus is a matter of experience, but in most cases this will be attained by laying the A.V. horizontal and pouring water through the filling-hole until the water is on the point of overflowing. Insert the stopper and thoroughly dry all parts of the apparatus with a clean cloth. With a clean glass rod, smear a thin coat of vaseline over the whole surface of the inner lining. Excessive vaseline should not be used as it may run down into the collecting cup and contaminate the semen. Insert a clean dry clinical thermometer into the open end of the A.V. and leave it in position while the glass cup is being secured. At the time of use, the temperature in the lumen should not be more than 45ºC. (112248 Artificial Insemination in Cattle on the right side, holding the A.V. mouth downwards in his right hand. As the bul mounts the A.V. is held behind his foreleg against the cow's flank, at an angle of 45° with the mouth pointing towards the bull's penis The penis is directed into the A.V. by the operator holding the sheath with his left hand It is better not to touch the penis itself with the hand as this may cause the bull to retract and dismount. As soon as the penis comes into contact with the warm libricated inner surface of the A.V. the bull thrusts vigorously upwards and ejaculates. The A.V. should then be turned with the cup downwards to allow the semen to run into the cup. If the bull has not been used for some time, it is best to make a second collection in a fresh cup and to use this semen for insemination, discarding the first collection. In such a case, the first sample usually contains a large percentage of old immotile or abnormal spermatozoa which have been matured for a considerable time in the epididymes. Also. if the quantity of the ejacu- late is small, a second collection should be made immediately after the first. For ejaculation to occur, it is necessary that the animal shall thrust vigorously into the A.V. Sometimes a bull will introduce his penis into the apparatus several times without ejaculating, and several c.c. of a slightly cloudy and watery secretion will accumulate in the collecting cup. It comprises chiefly secre- tion from the seminal vesicles and should be discarded. It is probable that conditions in the lumen of the A.V.249 presence of urine which may often be detected also by smell. A pinkish or reddish colour indicates an admixture of fresh blood. while a deep reddish-brown colouration probably indi- cates the presence of decomposed blood. Specimens showing abnormal colour or marked deficiency in density should not be used for insemination. Examination for Motility. A satisfactory ex- amination for motility can be made by placing a drop of semen from a well-mixed sample on a slide and placing a cover slip on it. For routine examinations 250 Artificial Insemination in Cattle torch held by an assistant. (Several specula are now available in which the light is incorpo- rated in the instrument). Holding the insemi- nating syringe in the right hand, the nozzle is introduced a small distance into the cervical canal and a quantity of 0.5 to 1 c.c. of semen is deposited directly into the lumen of the cervix. If the sperm is not required for other cows, more than 1 c.c. may be used. The syringe and speculum are withdrawn, and if the cow strains, her back is pinched for a few minutes. There are various patterns of insemination syringes and catheters, but whichever type is used, it is essential that metal, which is delete- rious to spermatozoa, shall not come into con- tact with the semen. A useful, easily made instrument can be constructed from a 20-inch length of fine-bore glass tube. This should have rounded ends to prevent any possibility of damage to the cervix, etc. The glass tube is attached to a 2 c.c. all-glass syringe by a short length of rubber tubing (Fig. 1) or a rubber bulb [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1 may be used instead. When using the insemi- nator shown in Fig. 1 the amount of semen required for use in each cow, 0.5 to 1 c.c., is taken up in the glass nozzle and no sperm comes in contact with the 2 c.c. syringe. This facilitates cleaning and sterilizing of insemi- nator, as only the glass tubes need to be steri- lized by heat and dried before use, and several of these can be carried, a clean one being used for each insemination. This type of insemi- nator can also be used without a speculum. The cervix is grasped by one hand per rectum and the glass nozzle of the inseminator intro- duced into the vagina, and thence through the first or second ring of the cervix, where the semen is deposited. A 2 c.c. syringe is the most suitable, 5 c.c. and 10 c.c. syringes being too heavy for use. The pressure tubing should be pushed up over the whole diameter of the 2 c.c. syringe, as shown in Fig. 1, as this gives extra rigidity and saves repeated breakages. An alternative method of insemination has been recently introduced in which the semen is placed in gelatine capsules which have been coated with paraffin wax. The capsules can be inserted into the cervix by means of a capsule "gun" designed for this purpose, or by hand. When the hand is used, liquid paraffin should be used for lubrication. This method is still under investigation and it is not possible to recommend it at present. 6. THE STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF SEMEN (a) For use within three hours. The precau- tions to be taken are relatively simple. The semen is transferred to a small, clean, dry test- tube. In warm, summer weather, no special temperature precautions are necessary. In cold, winter weather, the semen must be pro- tected from a sudden fall in temperature; this may be done by placing the test tube in a waist- coat pocket or by wrapping it in cotton wool and placing it under the dashboard of a motor car, etc. At all times it should be protected from bright light and must never be exposed to direct sunlight. (b) For use at an interval greater than three hours. It has been established that cooling is the best method of preserving semen. Sper- matozoa normally live only a comparatively short time at body temperature, and room tem- perature (20° to 21° C) has likewise been found too high for successful prolonged storage. Most workers are agreed that the longest viabi- lity of spermatozoa is secured at a storage temperature of about 5° to 10° C. (40° to 50° F.). In the cooling of semen for storage and its sub- sequent warming for use, it is essential that the change of temperature shall be gradual. or the sperm will die from temperature shock. The semen is transferred, using a Pasteur pipette, from the collecting cup to a 5 c.c. Pyrex storage tube. The tube is then filled with liquid paraffin to exclude access of oxygen to the semen. The tube is corked with a rubber or freshly waxed cork stopper. The tube is wrapped in cotton wool and placed in a tightly stoppered, flat-bottomed con- tainer tube, which is immersed for about 30 minutes in water gradually cooled to about 10° C. by adding ice. Finally, the tubes are transferred to a refrigerator or to a thermos food jar or flask containing shipped ice at 5° to 10° C. (Fig. 2). Stored in this way, sperm of initially
251 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2.252 Artificial Insemination in Cattle advisability of using semen stored for long periods is questionable in view of the low ratio pregnancies which results therefrom. The practical limits of storage for semen are 24 to 48 hours; and, provided the semen shows good motility at the time of insemination, the rate of conception should approximate to that of normal service. 8. DILUTION OF SEMEN It is emphasized that dilution of semen should be avoided except when it is necessary to in- seminate a large number of animals from a single ejaculate, as, for example, in large-scale artificial insemination schemes. The undiluted ejaculate can generally be utilized for the in- semination of about three to five cows. The addition of a suitable diluent increases the number of cows which may be inseminated from one ejaculate to about ten. Special diluting solutions ready for use can be purchased from firms specializing in the supply of apparatus for artificial insemination. 9. NOTES ON THE CLEARING OF APPARATUS. Artificial Vagina. Before use, new inner timings should be turned inside out and linings should be turned inside out and washing soda has been added. They should then be rinsed thoroughly in run- ning water to remove all trace of soda and then hung up to dry. After use, the vaseline which is used as a lubricant must be removed as soon as possible otherwise it tends to 'perish' the rubber. To do this, place A.V. in a bucket containing hot water and washing soda; then with a bottle brush (24 inches long) thoroughly cleanse the inside of the liner. Rinse in water and then swab the liner with a piece of cotton wool or rag soaked in 65 per cent. alcohol; the swab is held in an 18-inch swab-holder. Syringes collecting cups, etc. Wash all glassware, new and after use, first in cold water, then in hot water and washing soda. Rinse in running water, followed by 65 per cent alcohol. Allow to become thoroughly dry before use by standing on blotting paper or by placing on a warm oven or hot tank. When not in use all the apparatus should be protected from dust. 10.

At this dilution, in cold normal saline, they rapidly become immotile. The count .is made under a 1/6 objective and a mechanical stage greatly facilitates the work. If the dilution is about right (approximately five sperm per small square), an accurate estimate is obtain- ed by counting the number of spermatozoa in three rows of 16 small squares, one in the middle, and one at each end of the cytometer, and taking the average in 16 small squares. As the volume of each small square is 1/80 cu. mm., the number of spermatozoa per cu. mm. of the semen may be calculated from the following equation, where = mean number of spermatozoa in 16 small squares, d = dilution : No. of sperm cu. mm. = 80x × d/16 254 Genetics of Viruses Pathogenic to Animals of living cells. Some viruses are infective for susceptible animals in very high dilutions. They are titratable and the minimum infect- ive dose can be determined by tests on suit- able laboratory animals according to standard- ized technique. When an animal or a living chick embryo is infected with 1 to 10 minimal doses, with ensuing fatal results, it is found that the virus has reproduced itself in relatively enormous quantities, a small fragment of tissue yielding billions of infective doses. Perpetuation of the virus and its multiplica- tion at each successive animal passage can be carried forward at will for unnumbered genera- tions or passages. Animals which have re- covered from a virus disease or which have survived experimental infection with a virus of modified or attenuated activity are more or less immune to subsequent infection with the same virus. In such cases the serum may contain antiviral bodies capable of neutralizing the activity of the corresponding virus in vivo and in vitro. A striking feature of many of the viruses is their power of adaptation to foreign hosts and changed environment. Evi- dence, so briefly indicated in the foregoing, of reproduction, multiplication, adaptation and the development of anti-viral bodies and immuno-biological reactionsE. A. WATSON 255 Recovery from a specific virus infection leaves more or less immunity against reinfection with the same virus. But where the virus is re- presented by a plurality of strains, high pro- tection or solid immunity prevails against only one strain. Protection will be slight or, at best, only partial against other strains of the same group. A solid immunity against the homologous strain may therefore prove in- effective against heterologous strains. The coming into existence and development of im- munologically distinct strains of a virus may well be conceived as being brought about by changed environment, animal host species and mode of adaptation. Knowledge of- the multi- plicity of virus strains is growing and it is pro- bable, as investigations continue, that a much greater number than at present recognized, will be uncovered. One of the greatest handicaps in the study of viruses has been the difficulty in transmit- ting them and propagating them in laboratory experimental animals. But this is being over- come with increasing knowledge of the suscep- tibility of the guinea pig, rabbit, white mouse and ferret to certain virus infections and of the behaviour of such viruses in these animals and in the developing chick embryo. Even now there may be more or less difficulty in making the initial transfer from the natural to the ex- perimental host and in obtaining the first 'take.' which may cause little health disturb- ance or escape observation. But after a few serial passages the virus adapts itself to the new host and environment with, as a rule, in- creasing pathogenicity. With some viruses and experimental animals only a few passages or generations are required, and with others many, for the attainment of fixed virulence and type. With certain viruses, such as those of South African horse-sickness, and yellow fever of man, the phenomenon of changing a typical viscerotropic into a fixed neurotropic virus occurs as a result of intercranial inocula- tions in serial passage, particularly in white mice. Moreover, it would appear that the type of virus which has been developed by adaptation and fixation in the experimental host is maintained and is not reversed when re-introduced to the original host. Further modification is indicated by the observation that a virus, which has attained its highest possible virulence in the passage animal and kills it in a given period of time, is generally less infective and pathogenic for its original host than before its change of type and en- vironment. In our own distemper studies, virus strains originating from the fox, mink and dog have been maintained for a number of years by con- tinuous serial passage in ferrets. Some minor differences in their infectivity and pathogeni- city were apparent at the time they were first obtained, but none could be observed after serial passage in ferrets. And, while the strains are evidently fixed at their highest virulence for ferrets, these animals invariably succumbing to inoculation between the 10th and the 14th day following, usually between the 11th and the 13th day, it is rarely possible to produce clinical distemper with them in either dogs or foxes which were raised under strictly controlled conditions and which, theo- retically, should be uniformly and highly sus- ceptible to the disease. Thus, viruses that change in type and reach highest virulence in the passage animals may, at the same time and in the same process, become greatly at- tenuated for the original host species. Much practical use is being made of this in the pre- paration of living, attenuated viruses for pro- phylatic and immunization purposes from the brain tissues of white mice and the embryonic tissues of the developing chick. Experimenting with the virus of equine encephalomyelitis, we succeeded after several failures in establishing it in guinea pigs by intracranial inoculations of naturally infected horse brain. After a few passages it attained high virulence and appeared fixed as a neuro- tropic virus for guinea pigs. By similar proce- dure the guinea pig strain was established and fixed in white mice and, in turn, the mouse strain in the chick embryo. The comparative infectivity and. virulence of the three strains so developed in the guinea pig, mouse and chick embryo, respectively, are of significance. Tit- rating the virus-containing tissues of these animals in dilutions carried to 1: 100,000,000 using 0.1 c.c. of each dilution as the volumetric dose for inoculation, the minimal infective dose of the guinea pig virus is represented as 1: 1000, the mouse virus as 1: 100,000 and the chick virus as 1: 100,000,000. That is to say: the guinea pig virus has 50256 Agglutination Test for Brucella Infection in Cattle tionship to antibody production, serum-virus neutralization and immunity reactions, than the latter. It has already been demonstrated that the chick embryo strain of encephalomye- litis virus can be utilized for immunization purposes far more effectively than the other strams. But whether this is due alone to the great concentration of the virus in the chick embryo or to the concentration together with a change in the character of the virus itself, acquired by sojourn in the chick embryo, is at present an open question. One more virus disease may be mentioned in concluding this short discussion, namely, in- fectious equine anaemia, which has points of special interest. It is a highly infective but non-contagious disease, septicaemia-like in character, appearing in either an acute or chro- nic form and marked by recurring febrile periods which, in the early stages, take place at remark- ably regular intervals of approximately 21 days and are suggestive of a cycle not unlike that of certain protozoan infections. The virus is present and apparently multiplies in the circu- lating blood and has no known special affinities for cellular tissues. The minutest quantity of blood will transmit infection and disease to a healthy horse, and this, with other observations, has led to the strong suspicion that an insect host or vector is responsible for the natural transmission of the disease. Horses which recover from the disease, and they are many, are apprently immune from further attack but may carry the virus in their blood for the rest of their natural lives and thus become virus reservoirs. As an instance, a horse which had recovered from the naturally contracted disease when about five years of age, lived the remainder of its life at one of our research stations, passing 20 years of age. At intervals during that whole period its blood proved highly infective for horses and repro- duced the typical disease. The fact that apparently normal healthy horses may be and frequently are carriers of infectious-anaemia virus is not to be overlooked when horses are used for the production of anti-sera intended for either human or animal use. Inability to infect any species of laboratory animal or to propagate the virus of infectious equine anaemia under laboratory conditions has hindered the investigations we have carried on for 25 years. But with improved methods of study recently introduced and experience gained with regard to susceptibility of mouse, ferret and chick embryo to virus infections, there are increasing possibilities of propagating this virus in the laboratory and of studying it to better effect. Many other diseases in which the etiological agent is filterable and ultramicroscopic occur in North America. Many more, unknown on the North American Continent, are frequent in either Europe, Asia or Africa. These virus diseases are just as important, economically, as the diseases of known bacterial origin, with which they have much in common. The view that viruses are animate, particulate elements and agencies appears to be well taken and doubtless will be held until satisfactory evi- dence to the contrary has been produced. Their orderly classification, powers of multipli- cation and adaptation, as well as other inher- ent properties and affinities will for a consider- able time to come hold the attention of virolo- gists and, perhaps the interest and scrutiny of geneticists. THE STANDARDIZATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE AGGLUTI- NATION TEST FOR BRUCELLA INFECTION IN CATTLE* By W. L. HINDMARSH, B.V.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., D.V.H., Veterinary Research Station, Glenfield, N. S. W THE Secretary of Section L has asked me to lead the discussion on the subject of "What constitutes a reaction to the agglutination test for contagious abortion?" At first glance it might appear that a certain degree of agglu- tination and sedimentation of the bacteria constitutes a reaction, but in the diagnosis of infection the matter is by no means so simple. It appeared to me, therefore, that a general dis- cussion of the development of the test and the various factors involved would be of some value. Topley [1933] records that agglutination of bacteria was first described by Gruber and Durham in 1896. Grunbaum [1896], Widal [1896] and Widal and Sicard [1897] recognized the value of the test for the diagnosis of typhoid *Reprinted from the Australian Veterinary Journal, Vol. XVI, No. 1, February 1940
W. L. HINDMARSH 257 fever, but its use was soon extended to other diseases, though often with indifferent success [Arkwright, 1931]. In addition to the testing of sera for the presence of agglutinins against bacteria suspected of having invaded the host, agglutination was utilized in the identification of unknown bacteria. Specific agglutination is now regarded as occurring in two stages. In the first place the bacteria are acted upon by the agglutinin present in the serum of the infected or immune animals. This action confers on the bacteria the property of clumping in the presence of neu- tral salts in low concentration. In the second place the bacteria are agglutinated into clumps in the presence of electrolytes. The clumps then fall to the bottom of the tube by gravity. Wright and Smith [1897] used the agglutina- tion test for the differentiation of Malta and typhoid fever. Birt and Lamb [1899] describ- ed the agglutination test for Malta fever, basing their work on that done previously by Wright. These authors recognized the necessity for a standard method of preparing antigen, a know- ledge of the agglutination titres of sera of normal and infected individuals and a knowledge of the period that elapsed between infection and the presence of agglutinins in the serum. Since this work was published the agglutina- tion test has come into general use in the diag- nosis of infection of cattle with Brucella abortus. McFadyean and Stockman [1912] concluded as a result of their tests that "one will be justi- fied in regarding complete agglutination with a serum dilution of 1 in 50 or 1 in 100 as strong evidence of infection." They drew attention to the fact that all animals whose sera give a posi- tive reaction do not necessarily abort and that certain infected animals which do abort may not give a positive reaction at or shortly after the event although later the serum will react positively. The standardization of the bacterial suspension used in these tests was 'when view- ed in one of the small tubes employed for the tests, it was faintly hazy in appearance." The tubes were incubated at 37°C. to 38°C. for 24 hours before reading. Seddon [1915] reported upon his investiga- tions into use of the agglutination test. He emphasized the necessity for a standardized bacterial emulsion for use as antigen, using a suspension of barium sulphate258 Agglutination Test for Brucella Infection in Cattle these laboratories. The results were far from uniform. 19 cows reacted negative or doubtful. 24 cows reacted negative or doubtful or positive. 2 cows reacted doubtful or positive. 1 cow reacted negative or positive. 4 cows only gave a positive reaction to all the methods used. Thus 46. of the 50 cattle would have been judged positive, negative or doubtful accord- ing to the technique adopted. Similarly in America sera have been examin- ed simultaneously in a number of laboratories with reactions that varied to a considerable degree. When one considers the large number of institutions throughout the world in which the test for Bang's disease is carried out, the almost innumerable variations in technique and interpretation, and the fact that, in spite of these variations, herds are being rid of the infection, we can only marvel at the results being attained. However, it is undoubtedly true that the less exact methods lead to eco- nomic loss in causing the disposal of non- infected animals and in lengthening the period of eradication by the failure to select some infected cattle. It is obvious that in deciding the signi- ficance of the results of the test we are not concerned merely with the highest or lowest dilution which gives agglutination; we have to take into consideration: (a) The suspension of bacilli. (b) The blood serum. (c) The diluting fluid. (d) The treatment of the combination of serum and antigen. Frei [1937] discussed these matters very fully, and his opinions are freely quoted in the following summary. Scrum. Coagulation can exercise an action on the colloids of the serum and notably on the agglutinins. Coagulation at low tempera- tures or shaking during coagulation must be avoided, otherwise the agglutination titre will be lowered. Tests should be put up as soon as possible after collection of the serum, since the titre may fall if the serum is held for lengthy periods, although delay of three or four days is not of much significance. How far the holding of uncontaminated sera is of importance is difficult to state, but the sera used as known positive controls at Glenfield have been for some months carbolized without any appreciable loss of titre in the diagnostic range. These sera are, however, strongly positive, and it can be understood that a slight loss of agglutinin may be of significance with sera on the border line; of course contamina- tion of the sera, which frequently occurs in field collection and at high temperatures, exer- cises an adverse influence and renders some sera untestable. Similarly haemolysis and consequent staining of the serum is undesir- able, and according to Frei may lessen the titre. In our experience haemolysis frequent- ly leads to a deposit in the control tube not containing antigen and thus renders the inter- pretatior. of the test very difficult. Frei, quoting the report of the U. S. A. Commission on Bang's Disease, states that, whilst varia- tions of pH within fairly wide limits (4.7 to 8.9) do not have any noticeable effect on the titre, unclean bottles, especially those which have held disinfectants such as cresol or soaps, tend to lower the titre. Bacterial suspension. It is generally known that the agglutinability of the antigen is in- fluenced by the method of culture and type of culture media employed. Stableforth showed that when using the same bacterial strain there was a difference in the agglutinability of sus- pensions prepared in the different media, pre- pared in similar media but using organs from different species of animals, and even in different flasks using the same medium. Hence it is well-nigh impossible to guarantee that supplies of media prepared under similar conditions will be identical. Such difficulties could be overcome if each batch of antigen could be titrated against a standard serum; the recent work in the preparation of standard dry serum offers hope in this direction. Whilst many laboratories prepare their anti- gens from cultures when they have attained their apparent maximum growth, e.g., after two or three days. Frei prefers to use 24- hour cultures, since, in his opinion, at this age of culture there is maximum agglutin- ability. Culture is sometimes raked off the medium with a glass rod or a platinum needle. In the U. S. A., however, the usual practice is to flood the flask or tube with carbol saline, and allow the fluid to remain in contact with the culture two or three hours before washing off. In any case the suspension must be filtered to remove any particles of agar, which, if left in the antigen, may increase the degree of agglutination. The use of living bacteria in the suspension is favoured by some, but the consensus of
W. L. HINDMARSH 259 opinion is against this practice on account of danger to the laboratory staff, and because the bacteria may be killed without any appreciable effect on agglutinability. In this connection Henry and Traum have stated that tricresol 0.2 per cent and carbolic 0.5 per cent have scarcely any effect on the results of the test, but that formalin is not desirable. As previously mentioned the density of the suspension is very important. Various methods have been adopted in the fixation of a standard of density. Opacity standards, enumeration of bacilli, centrifugalization, nephelometers and opacity meters have all been used. Probably the best method is by centrifugalization, using Fitch's modification of Hopkins' vaccine tube. Whilst some writ- ers have stated that within certain limits the density of the suspension is without influence on the results of the test, others, notably Fitch, Donham, Bishop and Boyd, are of opinion that the maximum titre of agglutination of sera containing a moderate quantity of agglu- tinin changes with the density of the antigen. Stableforth has shown that with an increase in the density of the antigen there was a diminution in the titre of the serum. The agglutinability of strains of Brucella from different sources varies to a great degree. Traum and Henry tested the agglutinability of 22 strains of Br. abortus and found consi- derable variation. Frei states that many strain react with sera which give negative results with other strains. On this account most workers use a suspension made of a number of strains. In putting up the test it is usual to use a series of serum dilutions, although in the routine testing of large numbers of sera the series is a small one. Some workers make their serial dilutions in normal saline or carbol- saline before adding the sera to the antigen. Others, notably in America, add undiluted serum direct to the antigen. Stableforth states that with the latter method higher titres are obtained. The actual volume of fluid in the tubes is of some importance, as agglutination is more rapid in the smaller volumes, although the final result is probably the same. The tubes are usually incubated at from 37° C. to 40° C.. although agglutination will take place at lower temperatures. Frei agrees with the finding of the Commission on Conta- gious Abortion of U. S. A. (1932-33) that the test should remain in the incubator 42 hours at least.

INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST With regard to Brucella infection of cattle, we must bear in mind that:260 Agglutination Test for Brucella Infection in Cattle Willems found that the index of agglutin- ability of the English suspension was 400 and the titre indicating infection will be obtained by multiplying the index of agglutinability by the constant of agglutination 400 × 0.07142= 28.56, or roughly 1/30. Stableforth regarded a positive reaction as that of 25 per cent agglutination with a serum dilution of 1/40. With the standard serum and the English suspension 25 per cent of agglutination was obtained with a serum dilution of 1/500. The titre of infection, therefore, is 500 × 28.56/400 = 1/35.7, which is very close to Stableforth's standard of 1/40. Willems points out that this shows that the infection titre recognized by him is close to that adopted by Stableforth, but he stated that it is not possible to forecast the titre of a serum with mathematical precision. He tested the method on 11 sera:ABSTRACTS 261 history and the stage of gestation. Thus Donham and Fitch would prefer to accept as non-infected a cow showing a low agglutina- tion titre from a herd with no positive reactors than a non-reactor from a diseased herd. All that has been said so far refers to the microscopic tube agglutination test as carried out in the laboratory. Attention is drawn to the rapid tests which have been evolved in other countries, parti- cularly America. The rapid plate agglutina- tion test is being used in at least one State in the eradication of Brucella infection of cattle, and in other States it is playing some part in the control schemes. It is claimed that with this test quantities of serum ap- proximately equal to those used in the tube test are employed and that the results are very reliable. Of course, if this test were adopted a standard antigen should be available to all veterinarians using it, and a standard of technique and interpretation would be required. CONCLUSIONS There is no generally accepted standard for the performance and interpretation of the agglutination test for the diagnosis of Brucella infection of cattle. Some attempts have been made to evolve a method of standardization of this test. A standard of preparation of the bacterial suspension should be adopted in Australia, and the agglutinability of each batch be tested against a standard positive serum. The standard positive serum can be main- tained at approximately its original titre for some years in a dry condition. It would be an advantage if the standard suspension to be used throughout Australia could be prepared in one central laboratory. A standard technique should be adopted throughout Australia so that the tests carried out in different laboratories will be comparable. Consideration should be given to the adop- tion of the rapid methods of agglutination testing since these would be of value to the field officer in the initial determination of the approximate degree of infection in a herd. It may be possible to adopt this method as the standard test as has been done in parts of America. REFERENCES Topley, W. W. C. (1933). An Outline of Immunity, p. 68.

A.] Yield, chemical composition, and feeding value for milk production of alfalfa hay cut at three Stages of maturity. Tech Bull. U. S. Dep. Agric. No. 739, 1940, 1-51 THE effect of cutting alfalfa at defferent stages of maturity on its yield, chemical composition, colour, leafiness and relative nutritive value as determined by feeding experiments and digestion trials on sheep and Holstein cows is given. Cutting alfalfa at 3 stages of maturity, namely (a) initial bloom stage when not more than 10 per cent of the plants are in bloom, (b) at half bloom stage when about 50 per cent of the plants are in bloom and (c) at full bloom stage when 90 to 100 per cent of the plants are in bloom appears to have significant effect on the quality. Alfalfa cut at the initial or half bloom stage was markedly superior in the yield of hay; (8938 lb. and 8888 lb. as against 6940 lb. per acre) and yield of digestible nutrients per acre (4660 lb. and 4413 lb. as against 3269 lb. per acre per year) to the alfalfa cut at the full bloom stage. The line of demarcation between the first and second stage is not very signifi- cant. With sheep as experimental animals, the average digestion coefficients obtained for crude protein were 77.7 per cent for the initial bloom hay, 77.1 for the half-bloom hay and 75.4 for the full-bloom hay. The corresponding digestible coefficients for crude fibre were 47.7, 41.4 and 38.3 per cent respectively. Experiments on 3 Holstein cows fed exclusively on initial bloom of alfalfa hay showed an average production of 11,099 lb. of milk and 404 lb. of butter fat (calculated on mature age basis). The cows on half bloom hay produced on an average 9763 lb. of milk and 345 lb. of butter fat (mature age basis) The 4 cows on full-bloom hay produced an average of 8981 lb. of milk and 331 lb. of butter fat on mature age basis. The rate of consumption of initial bloom-hay per pound of milk and butter fat produced was less than that of half and full bloom hay. The calculated amount of milk produced per acre was 6330 lb. for initial bloom plot, 5234 lb. for the half bloom plot and 3970 lb. for the full bloom plot after the actual quantity of milk produced was corrected to 4 per cent butter fac. [M. C. R. The feeding of dairy cows for intensive milk pro- duction in practice. E. MEIGS (1939). U.S. Dep. Agric. Yearbook Agric., 566-91 THE importance of roughage and concentrates in the feeding of dairy cows, the proper way of feeding and the determination of the amount of food required are given. The vital importance of good roughage, concentrates and pasture for maintaining the high producing dairy cow is stressed. Half and half of legume hay (alfalfa) and grass hay (timothy) are recommended for high milk yielders. A good concentrate mixture can be made up of 4 parts of corn meal, 3 parts of wheat bran land parts of one or more of the oil cake meals plus 1 per cent of salt. Feeding cows according to the Savage Standard which is very liberal standard, appears to be the best. To maintain uniform body weight, heavy milking cows, in the early part of the lactation, should be fed ad libitum hay and as much concentrates in addition as they would clear up in half an hour twice a day. For successful, reproduction, cows need about 10 p. m. carotene in the dry matter of the ration. Tender grasses or legumes high quality alfalfa meal and cod liver oil are good vita- min A concentrates. Cod liver oil in large quantities appears to be harmful to cows. It reduces the fat content of the milk. Mature cows can be fed two ounces of cod liver oil per day. Heavy milking cows require about 0.25 per cent each of calcium and phosphorus in the dry matter of the ration. Iodine deficiency is not frequent in dairy cows. The author discourages the practice of administering mineral preparations and vitamins to make up for poor rations. [M. C. R.] Studies on the nutritive requirements of Bacteria. WOLLEY (1941). J. Bact. 42, 155 THE author describes some of his interesting researches regarding growth-factor and amino-acid requirements of certain bacteria. He found that the addition of riboflavin, pantothenic acid and a suitable reducing agent to a tryptone and liver extract medium, inactivated with alkali, could restore the original effectiveness of the medium for the growth of haemolytic streptococci. He then attempted to grow a member of group D of haemolytic streptococci on a synthetic basal medium containing hydrolysate of puri- fied casein, glucose, inorganic salts, riboflavin, panto- thenic acid and reduced iron and observed that the addition of vitamin to this medium was essential for the growth. Then the only unknown constituents of this basal medium were the amino-acids of casein hydrolysate. He also discovered that substitution of a mixture of 19 pure amino-acids in place of the casein hydrolysate gave good growth. Glutaminic acid, trypto- phane, isoleucine, lysine, arginine, systine and tyrosine were, on the other hand, found, to be essential for growth; mixture of these 7 amino-acids produced a good growth of bacteria. But some closely related strains failed to grow on this simplified mixture of amino-acids and required a larger variety of amino-acids and nicotinic acid. Only the members of groups B and D of haemolytic streptococci would grow on this purified medium. For the growth of a member of group A, further addition of an unknown water soluble factor of liver extract was necessary. The attention of the author was then drawn to the fat soluble growth-factors and he found that many such compounds possessing vitamin K activity were active for the growth of Johne's bacillus. He finally points out that the same compounds are concerned in the growth of all living cells, and the use of bacteria, rather than rats and other animals, for the tssay of vitamins would materially reduce the cost of the labour involved in the analysis of these substan- ces. He also mentions how the studies on microbial nutrition helped in the discovery of the chemical structure of pantothenic acid. [N.B.D.]
ABSTRACTS 263 The inheritance of equine coat color. The basic colors and patterns. G. W. SALISBURY (1941). J. Heredity 32, 235 THREE sources were used in obtaining information about the Inheritance of the more common colours, some specific colours and face and leg markings of the horse. These sources were the American Shetland Stud Book, the Studbook for Finish Horses and the records of the Jockey Club. Varying amounts of data on body colour, colour of mane and tail, white markings and other pat- terns are presented. Basic or foundation colours are listed as bay; brown; brown-black or seal brown; black; and liver chestnut; chestnut and sorrel. Colour may vary with age and ex- posure to sunlight, making it difficult to properly classify horses on the basis of colour. Undoubtedly (1) brown-black ponies were classified frequently as black instead of brown and (2) colts were improperly classified before the shedding of the foal hair whose colour may differ from the basic body colour. Despite these possible errors, brown is an important colour in the Shetland breed. Furthermore, different shades of chestnut were not distinguished by Shetland breeders. However, a study of 3,235 Shetland matings indicated that the mode of inheritance of the basic body colours is the same in this as in the larger breeds of horses. Wentworth reported that the light mane and tail of the Belgian horse were due to a monofactorial recessive to the normally pigmented mane and tail. The present study suggests, however, that it is more complicated, involving at least two recessive pairs of homozygous genes, with additional genes which modify the shade of the coat and also tend to influence the amount of pigment in the mane and tail. The white mane and tail seem to have the same inheritance in the chestnut as in the sorrel. Genes which are epistatic to the basic colours are 'those responsible for the grey colour, roaning, spotting, dominant white colour, and dilution of the basic colours. Observations on 106 matings indicate that grey is pro- duced by a dominant gene which is epistatic to the basic colours. The roaning gene acts similarly. There are two types of white spotting, each with a different inheritance. Extensive spotting is due to a dominant white spotting gene whereas limited spotting seems to be due to more than one pair of genes which may involve both dominance and recessiveness. Slight breed diffe- rences were noted which may be due to the 'unconscious selection practised in the development of these breeds.' A single dominant gene, epistatic to all colours, is indicated in certain white horses although this condi- tion is confused with both old homozygous gray and the results of the dilution gene on chestnut or sorrel. The dilution gene is not discussed in this paper. [J.N.W.]. The inheritance of equine coat color. II. The dilutes, with special reference to the Palomino. G. W. SALISBURY and J. W. BRITTON (1941) J.

The eyes show a bluish-pink appearance, the skin is pink. Certain previous workers called this colour cream, as distinguished from dun which referred to horses with a light body colour, black mane and tail, a dorsal stripe and often with 'Zebra-striped' legs. Those duns of a more yellow colour are commonly called buckskin. Wredit is reported to have felt that cream was an unflixable heterozygous condition, this theory is substan- tiated by breeding experiments. Heizer 'considered that dun, mouse, and cream are produced by a dominant dilution gene superimposed over certain basic body colors'. Tuff accepted this postulate but cconsidered that a pair of genes, responsible for the quantity of pigmentation, was involved. In the homozygous resces- sive condition this pair produced albino; he called it the albino factor. In the heterozygous condition the pair reduced chestnut to cream, bay or brown to buckskin, and dun to light dun, but had no influence on black of mouse'. His dilution gene, therefore, was dominant. Gremmel, on the other hand, concluded that the albino was a homozygous recessive for genes at three major loci of which one dominant at the first locus produced a Palomiono, while two dominant genes at this locus gave a red ysabella or sorrel. He denied any relationship of the Palomino to dun. The authors of the present study were confronted, therefore, with two postulates : one explaining Palomino by the basic chestnut or sorrel plus a dominant dilution gene, which also dilutes bay or brown to dun, and black to mouse; the other being chestnut or sorrel possessing a recessive member of a pair of genes responsible for basic pigment. A study of the American Shetland Stud Book and visits to Palomino breeding establishments provided material for the present work. The Shetland pony data indicated a dominant gene was responsible for cream, dun and mouse colours. Matings involving two animals with the dominant dilution gene gave mostly dilutes, where one parent was a dilute and one solid-coloured, the ratio of dilutes to non-dilutes was very close to the expected 1:1. No differences were found between creams and Palomino so far as colour, type or distribu- tion of colour was concerned. A relationship between these two colours, therefore, seems obvious. Visits to some Palomino breeding establishments as well as reports from others unvisited indicate that 40 to 50 per cent of the progeny of a Palomino stallion and chestnut or sorrel mares were Palominos, the rest were chestnut or sorrel. Breeding work of troop D, New York State Police at Oneida, New York, gave similar results. It is concluded, therefore, that the Palomino is pro- duced by the presence of a diluting gene which does not mask the effects of genes which cause intensity variations. A basic chestnut with a white mane and tail plus the dilution gene gives the most desirable coloured Palomina. When the gene for black is absent. the homozygous intensity reduction condition gives an individual with practically no pigment in the hair. When these are crossed on other colours the progeny all show a reduction of the hair pigment. It is not felt that where the gene for black is present, the homozygous dominant dilution condition produces an albino; the writers believe that such a case results in a washed-out, light dun. It appears that only one pigment reducing gene was involved in the horses studied. [J.N.W.] The chromosome complex of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) R. O. BERRY, (1941). J. Heredity 32, 261 SEVERAL workers have reported on the number of chromosomes in the domestic and wild sheep. Their observations were made largely on testicular material prepared by standard methods, or on the amnion. Most of them reported a diploid number of 54 or 60. With one exception, testicular material was used in cases where
264 ABSTRACTS 60 are reported and amnion preparations in cases of 54. A study of the chromosome complex of germ cells, therefore, was undertaken in the hope of establishing the exact number of chromosomes present in sheep. Modern techniques were employed. Chromosome counts were made on more than 65 spermatogonial cells, taken from lambs which had just attained sexual maturity. Many of the chromo- somes in these cells showed very little over-lying or touching so that they were easily distinguished one from the other. The diploid counts were consistently 54. 'Metaphase plates of the primary spermatocytes con- tained 27 chromosomes. Morphologically the chromo- somes of the sheep consist of a sphere; rods which may be long, short or bent; and large V's. These latter vary somewhat in size and symmetry, but were distinctly observed to be V-shaped single chromosomes and not two rods so arranged as to give the appearance of a V by the over-lying of one end of each. Since there were three pairs of these present involving six individual chromo- somes, the authors suspect that other workers may have considered them each made up of two rods over-lying at one end thus explaining counts of 60. The remaining 48 chromosomes consist of two pairs of slightly bent, medium sized rods, 43 straight rods varying from 4 to 1.5 microns long, and one sphere. Observations on the anaphase showed this one sphere paired with a medium sized rod. Considerable difference of opinion exists in reference to which chromosomes constitute the sex or X-Y chromo- somes. The authors of the present study believe the heteromorphic pair, viz. the medium sized rod and the small sphere, are the X-Y chromosomes. They do not think that the fact that different workers have studied three breed groups, two wild species, and hybrids of these wild species with domestic sheep' explains the variations reported in chromosome number or the diffe- rence in opinion on the morphological type of the X-Y pair. [J.N.W.] The inheritance of paralysed hind legs, scrotal hernia and atresia ani in pigs. S. BERGE (1941) J. Heredity 32, 271 WRIEDT reported the appearance of a recessive sub- lethal factor in a herd of Norweigian Landrace swine. Piglings born to heterozygous matings were 25 per cent effected. Symptoms were paralysed hind legs, the animal being unable to walk, although it could pull itself along with the forelegs. Koroveckaja reported a similar anomaly in Russia, but the proportion of affected piglings was 19.5 per cent, which is less than would be expected of a monogenic recessive factor. It is also reported that in certain other cases the forelegs were involved in individuals of the Large White breed in Sweden and the German Landrace. The forelegs were either bent or greatly enlarged. Warwick suggested that scrotal hernia in pigs was due to a digenic recessive, and Koroveckaja reported 57.1 per cent males in those litters in which the character was found. The author believes that the factor shows incomplete dominance and points out that, whereas the proportion of males in 414 litters at the Pig Breeding Station, Aas, Norway was 46.9 per cent, the proportion of males in those 31 litters in which scrotal hernia was manifest was 57.14 per cent. 'The excess of males is obviously caused by the fact that litters with a large number of males have a greater probability to reveal one or more cases of hernia' he says, and confirms a domi- nant umbilical hernia in the pig reported by Wriedt. Cases of atresia ani are referred to. Both sexes are involved; the males usually dying after about two or three days of age due to obstruction, the females generally having an opening from the ventral side of the rectum to the sheath which prevents obstruction. Some sows live to maturity and breed. The mode of inheri- tance of the character is irregular. It was found to be dominant in many cases. Two boars, Jarl and Frikk, had 21.2 and 13.3 per cent affected pigs in their litters respectively. Males and females were equally affected. Two sisters bred to Frikk, their father, gave 16 per cent affected offspring, but bred to Jarl they gave 26 7 per cent. The author contents that this shows that a monogenic mode of inheritance is out of the question, but he is unable to list the factors involved. Practically, it is impossible to purchase pigs for breed- ing purposes that one might be certain are free of the genes, causing this character. [J.N.W.] Genetics of the fowl. 15. Multiple spurs, a muta- tion linked with duplex comb, F. B. HUTT (1941). J. Heredity 32, 357 THE modern Black Sumatra cock must have atleast three spurs, according to the American Poultry Club. This breed of chickens dates back in the United States to importations in 1847. Females have no spurs. In appearance this breed looks much like game fowls, of which certain ones, said to have originated in India, may have as many as five spurs. At hatching time there is no difference between the male and female. In adult life the female shows only several enlarged scales at the spur site. Young males show gradual development of several spurs each of which develops much as one would on a single- spurred breed. In the adult male the top spur is generally smaller than the second or largest. Those below are smaller in a descending order. Those which are larger have a separate bony core. Although sexing on the basis of scale appearance at the spur site in the new born chick is not possible, 93 to 98 per cent accu- racy is obtained at this age when selecting those that will have multiple spurs from those which will have only a single spur. During a six year period, involving F1 F2 and back cross population of a Black Sumatra male and Single Comb White Leghorn females, all the F1 75 per cent. of the F2 and 50 per cent. of the backcrosses showed multiple spurs. This indicated a unifactorial dominant character. The symbol M was assigned to the gene. Evidence, however, from the progeny of one Single Comb Ancona cock, mated to four Mm hens, to test for the linkage of M, showed that there was, sometimes, a factor that suppressed M, in this case in about 46 per cent of his Mm progeny. Tests for linkage showed that M does not belong to either of the four autosomal linkage groups previously known, but that it is linked with D, which causes duplex comb. The finding of this relationship estab- lished a fifth linkage group. There was some suppres- sion of D noted in this study, but there was no indi- cation that the suppression of D was associated with the suppression of M. [J.N.W.] Hydrocephalus, a lethal in cattle. C. L. COLE and L. A. MOORE (1942). J. Agri. Res. 65, 483. BOTH internal and external types of hydrocephalus have been reported in most animals including man. The condition has sometimes been thought to be lethal in swine and mice; various degrees of association between hereditary and/or lethal hydrocephalus and
ABSTRACTS 265 flexed tail have been noted in these two animals. Slight hydrocephalus with agnathis in Jersey calves and hydrocephalus in crossbred dogs have also been reported. Two abnormal calves were born in a grade and pure- bred Holstein-Friesian herd in the year of 1939-40. The owner suspected his ration, although it was ade- quate. Examination of the herd showed that the two calves were from sire-daughter matings. By special arrangement 27 additional calves were produced in the herd of such matings. Three peculiarities were noted in these calves: viz. (1) a lethal, (2) asymmetrical faces, and (3) a 'jumpy' nervous condition. The lethal was manifest by an internal hydrocepha- lus and marked papilloedema; the skull was enlarged to two or three times its normal size. There were no apparent points of blockage of foramena, unless a very abnormal position of the foramen magnum might have partially or fully blocked the foramina of Magen- dic and Luschka, 'thereby causing the hydrocephalus as a secondary manifestation of a gene for bony abnor- malities'. The humeri and femurs were badly dis- torted, giving rise to tremendous width of the hips and crooked or twisted forelegs. Asymmetry was shown by a twisted appearance of the face caused not only by the peculiar manner in which the face and head were held, but also by irregularity in the length of the two maxillae and of the two mandibles. In the 'jumpy' condition, muscular co-ordination was lacking, the calf could not stand by itself unsupported, and tremor was present whether standing or lying. The three characters, it is suggested, are due to three recessive autosomal genes. The symbols given are as follows : normal L. lethal l, symmetrical A, asymmetrical a; and normal nervous reaction, J, 'jumpy' j. On this basis the sire was LlAaJj. Daugh- ters of this bull and normal dams would have had eight different genotypes, all normal, but nearly all carriers of one or more of the three recessive genes of the sire. The three abnormal characters would be expected to appear in a definite proportion of the pro- geny of these daughters and their own sire. The expected and observed distribution of phenotypes in the 27 calves were sufficiently close to confirm the postulated mode of inheritance whether linked or unlinked, although the authors advise further study of the mode of inheritance of 'jumpy' and asymmetry. [J.N.W.] Sex-linked albinism in the Turkey Meleagris gallopavo. F. B. HUTT AND C. D. MUELLER. J. Heredity 33, 69. STUDIES of an albino poult and its relatives showed that the condition is caused by a sex-linked recessive gene which induces imperfect albinism. A dingy white characterizes newly hatched affected poults in which the irregular stripes and colour pattern of Bronz poults are faintly visible. Mature birds had some pigment in the feathers which was more evident in the areas normally black. Newly hatched poults have a pale-grey iris which darkens with age. The pupil is red. Histological examination of prepared eye tissue showed absence of melanin in the pecten, the pigment epithelium of the functional retina and the choroid coat where it is normally abundant. Blind- ness also characterized live affected poults. In one pen of turkeys where this character first appeared there were 133 normal to 31 albinotic poults in three hatches ; this ratio of practically 3:1 suggested a simple recessive mutation. If it were autosomal, ratio of 101: 34 would have been expected from the 11 hens that produced albinos. The actual ratio was 106 :29. If the character were sex-linked the expected ratio of normal to albinotic poults among-the 164 off- spring from the one male would have been 123:41. The observed ratio fits both expected ratios fairly well. Eggs from a pen of turkeys among which the charac- ter was observed were hatched. Three Bronz coloured toms from these eggs were mated to normal hens and two pens of normal coloured stock were made up from the original pen. Dead embryos were examined if 24 days old. All albinotic progeny from these mat- ings were female in the ratio of 184 coloured : 45 albinos. This again fits the expected ratio, showing that the character is a sex-linked recessive mutation. The symbol al is tentatively assigned to the character. Of the 184 coloured poults from the five carrier toms, 37 died at 24-28 days incubation: of the 45 albinos, 34 had died during this period. The fact that the sex ratio of coloured embryos which died was close to 1 female to 2 male, which is what would be expected, showed that death in the albinos was due to this character and not to the fact they were all female. Differential mortality prior to 24 days may have accounted for the slight difference between the observed and the expected ratios. With very great difficulty one of the albinotic females which was born alive was raised to maturity. The character reduces the viability of embryos and poults. In the latter case blindness reduces the ability both to find food and of defence. The gene al, therefore, can be properly considered as a lethal gene. [J. N. W.]. The talpid lethal in the domestic fowl R. K COLE (1942). J. Heredity 33, 83 Low hatchability may sometimes result from the pre- sence of lethal genes which produce visible abnormali- ties in the embryos. A system of recording the results of examinations of dead embryos, including the age at death, made it possible to recognize the talpid lethal. The name of this lethal was taken from talpa, the Latin for mole, because of the shape of the embryotic appendages at death. The lethal was first found in 1936 when a sire was mated to his own daughters. The system of examin- ing dead embryos revealed the character by the physi- cal abnormalities resulting from it. Having found the lethal it was learned that it had also appeared in 1935 as a result of matings of the same sire to some of his own daughters. Dead embryos due to this gene, were found also in 1937 in eggs from matings of birds dis- tantly related to the sire mentioned. In the latter year only 46.2 per cent of 26 fertile eggs from one hen hatched, not entirely due to this lethal however, whereas 100 per cent of 12 fertile eggs from a full sister hatched. The first common ancestor of all carriers, pedigrees revealed, was a cock hatched in 1927. The talpid embryos are characterised by reduced length of proximal leg and wing bones, duplication of the distal appendage bones, fused digits in the feet and wings forming what appears like a webbed hand, shortened vertebral column, extreme ectopia and subcutaneous oedema, and a reduction of feather papillae development. Death usually occurs on the 8th to 10th day, although as late as the 17th day, of in- cubation. Birds heterozygous for the character show none of the abnormalities.
266 ABSTRACTS The symbol ta is suggested for this simple autosomal recessive character. Mortality under 4½ days was not classified. Hence there is a slight excess of normal over talpid embryos among those matings where 95 per cent or more of the embryos could be classified. Actually 23.6 per cent of the 415 eggs from such matings produced talpid em- bryos, whereas 25 per cent would be expected of a simple autosomal recessive. The fewer the deaths under 4½ days the nearer the agreement between the observed and expected incidence of the results of the lethal gene. Linkage tests were made by examining the linkage of ta with three of the five known autosomal linkage groups described by Hutt and Lamoreux. The results were as follows: 1. If 'ta is in the Cp.R.U. linkage group, it is not closely linked with r'; 2. The charac- ter 'ta probably does not belong to the DM linkage group'; and 3. '......there has been a ratio of parental to non-parental colours of 83 to 93, as compared to the expected ratio of 88 to 88 if I and ta were not linked' in the F I Cr linkage group; this difference is insigni- ficant. [J. N. W.]. A new type of autosomal nakedness in the domes- tic fowl, P. D. STURKIE (1942). J. Heredity 33, 202 NAKEDNESS in birds is of two types, viz. that in which feather follicles are abnormal, although pterylosis occurs and that in which pterylae are absent. The abnormality discussed here is of the latter type. The expression of the character varies from almost normal to almost complete nakedness, with degrees of the latter being rated as grades I, II, III and IV, indicating in- creasing orders of denudation. The frequency with which the different grades of nakedness were observed to occur was in the order II. III, IV, I. Progeny of a naked male and several heterozygous sons crossed with normal hens were naked and normal in very nearly a 1:1 ratio indicating a simple dominant character. Crosses of F1 naked females with a normal male gave naked males and naked females in a ratio of 1:1, indicating a simple autosomal character. It is believed that the mutation had occurred only recently in a female since the character was observed in only one bird, a male in 5000 which were progeny of approximately 250 females and 20 males. Its occur- rence originally in a male would have resulted, it is thought, in more individuals being involved. The hatchability of naked and normal chicks was the same. In all other respects, except for feathering, naked chicks were quite normal. There was a high mortality among naked chicks, however, from 10-15 days of age and thereafter. The feeding of wet mash seemed to reduce the death rate in naked chicks so long as it was fed. When dry mash was substituted the death rate would increase. The degree of denudation was not casually related to death rate. It seems, therefore, that this character is at least partially lethal. [J.N.W.] A new type of recessive achondroplasia in cattle. P. W. GREGORY, S. W. MEAD and W. M. REGAN (1942). J. Heredity 33, 317 THE appearance of a sub-lethal hereditary defect, an achondroplastic or bull-dog type, occurred in the Jersey herd of the California Experiment Station. Other authors have reported different types of this defect, of which one is due to a dominant gene, lethal when homozygous and another is due to a simple recessive gene. Both axial and appendicular skeletal structures are affected as indicated by a short head, deformed jaws, a cleft palate and short stumpy legs. The type reported herein is caused by a monofactorial autosomal recessive. The defect is variable, is usually lethal and may affect both axial and appendicular skeletal structures. Symp- toms in different cases vary from those having a short, broad head, legs of slightly reduced length and a slightly undersized body to those showing such ex tremely abnormal conditions as a short, broad head, short ears, very irregular incisor teeth in a very short and therefore deformed lower jaw so that the incisors meet the upper jaw opposite the first molars, an extreme degree of cleft palate, a hard palate developed only about half an inch on each side and marked flexion of the anterior pasterns. It is concluded that the defect is caused by a mono- factorial autosomal recessive gene, because the observed incidence fits the expected incidence quite well in each of three types of matings in this herd. These three types of matings were: '(1) the mating of a carrier bull to his own daughters or the daughters of another carrier bull......; (2) the mating of a carrier bull to daughters and great granddaughters of carrier sires...... and (3) the mating of a carrier bull to daughters, grand daughters and great granddaughters of carrier sires......, One bull number 320A, was the sire, grand sire or great-grand sire of all affected calves borne, although this bull and one cow, number 344, apparently obtained the gene from their common sire, number 3,000. It is unknown, however, whether the mutation occurred with bull number 3,000 or was handed down to him by or through one parent. This type of achondroplasia seems to differ from a dominant type found in Dexter cattle, but seems to resemble the recessive type first reported in Telemark cattle of Norway. These two latter types do not belong to an allelic series, but involve two independent loci. [J.N.W.] Bacteriological methods for the large scale detec- tion of Mastitis. G. Davis (1942) Vet. Rec. 15, 54 The author emphasises the importance of milk produc- tion and the prevention of disease, which decrease milk yield. He lays great stress upon the detection of mastitis and its early diagnosis in large dairy herds. The technique which he advocates for its diagnosis and eradication or control is simple and economic. He has no confidence in any method other than planting freshly taken samples in a non-inhibitory medium and picking off and confirming colonies.
