IP IP/25/CC.3 Govt. of {1893} Madras. REVENUE. Issued. Recd. Encl. G.O., 28th June 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B. 576C. JUNE. Cinchona Department. Reviewing report on the working of the Gov- ernment 24 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE. of the Government of India, to introduce the Bengal system of sale through postmasters as an experiment in a few selected districts. 8. The receipts during the year under review, excluding the cost of quinine packets supplied to Collectors for distribution, amounted to Rs. 72,798, being Rs. 17,202 and 12,202 less than the budget and revised estimates respectively. The decrease is due to a reduction in the price of quinine and to the Ceylon Govern- ment having discontinued the purchase of quinine from the Nedivattam factory. The cost of the quinine packets supplied to the Collectors at the rate of Re. 1 per packet was Rs. 1,410. The expenditure of the department during the year amounted to Rs. 78,886, or Rs. 4,114 less than the budget and revised estimates. The reduction in the estimated expenditure is explained by a laudable desire on the Director's part to equalize, as far as possible, the actual revenue and expenditure. The latter, however, was still Rs. 6,088 in excess of the former. 9. The usual statements showing the receipts and disbursements during the year under review and previous years have this year been prepared by Mr. Lawson and are printed as appendices 11 and 12 to his report. The Director considers the form of statement No. 12 to be somewhat cumbrous and proposes to substitute a simpler form which, he thinks, will meet all requirements. The Government is, however, unable to accept the Director's proposal as the form at present in use has been adopted in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of State for India and cannot be altered without his authority. 10. Mr. Hooper's report on the analytical work done by him contains as usual much interesting matter. (True Extract.) (Signed) C. A. GALTON, Secretary to Government. To the Government Botanist.

The results of the two analyses are thus compared:8 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE. From D. HOOPER, Esq., Government Quinologist, to the Government Botanist and Director of the Cinchona Plantations, Nilgiris, dated Ootacamund, 6th May 1893. I have the honour to forward the following report on the analytical work conducted in the laboratory during the year ending 31st March 1893. 2. Among the barks analysed during the year there have not been many of special interest or of very high value. A sample of crown bark from Dodabetta yielded 5.55 per cent. of sulphate of quinine, which is above the average of the bark used in the factory obtained from that plantation. A specimen of Bagota bark from an estae near Dodabetta belonging to General Jennings gave 5.81 per cent. of sulphate. The age of this tree was six years and it is supposed to be a variety of the Santa Fé or soft Columbian bark. The following is a full analysis of the bark: 7 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE. the whole of the organic matter, with the contained nitrogen, would have been vola- tilized and lost; but by burying them deep in the ground the gases, as they are given off during the processes of decomposition, are absorbed by the soil and so made available for future use. Thus it will be seen that to cultivate the surface of the ground only is very wasteful when compared with deep cultivation. The following are analyses of three barks of Cinchona officinalis hybrids which were uniform so far as regards site and age. The samples in each case were taken not from one tree only but from twenty, so that the analyses may be regarded as repre- senting the average qualities of the trees grown over the whole of the several plots.

The following is the new form proposed: RS. A. P. Value of 4,933 lb. of quinine at Rs. 13-6-0 per lb. 65,978 14 0 Do. of 3,139 lb. of febrifuge at Rs. 10 per lb. 31,390 0 0 Miscellaneous receipts, such as sale of plants and seeds, &c 1,061 2 5 Total 98,430 0 5 Expenditure for the year including salaries, upkeep of estate, factory, &c 78,885 11 8 Profit on the year's working 19,544 4 9 Total 98,430 0 5 (g) Spelling of names.4 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE. At the close of the last year, there remained in stock 416,858 lb. of bark, making in all 536,341 lb. Of this quantity 173,992 lb. were disposed of during the year as follows: 5 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE. The greater part of the bark used during the year was crown bark, but of varying alkaloidal value; some was as poor as to yield only 2.37 sulphate of quinine; this was from the trees spoken of above under III. "General condition"-(a) "Doda- betta"- while the sulphate of quinine in other bark ran as high as 5.55 and this was from the better trees on the estates taken by the stripping process. As the amount of quinine and febrifuge turned out in the factory was exceeding the immediate demands, it was thought desirable to work chiefly upon the inferior classes, and so relieve the godowns, which are choked, and reserve the better sorts for a future day. Taking the present price of the quinine at Rs. 14-1-7 per lb. and the febrifuge at Rs. 10, the value of these drugs in stock at the end of the year amounted to Rs. 80,633-15-10, thus:- RS.A.P. 4,381 lb. 13 oz. of quinine at Rs. 14-1-7 per lb 61,7781510 1,885 lb. 8 oz. of febrifuge at Rs. 10 per lb 18,85500 Total 80,6331510 X. MR. HOOPER'S REPORT.-During the year Mr. Hooper made a great number of analyses of barks, soils, chemicals. &c., for this department; some of which being of general interest he has embodied in his report. XI. MISCELLANEOUS-(a) Issue of packets of quinine powders.-When compared with the results in the previous year, the indents for quinine powders have been satis factory; the numbers sent out by this department having been no less than 1,704 packets or 170,400 powders. Last year only 370 packets or 37,000 powders were desposed of. Up to the time of writing, only eight reports on the sales by Collectors during the past year have been received, viz., from Salem, Malabar, Nilgiris, Coimba- tore, Gódávari, Cuddanah, Vizagapatam and Tanjore; and so in accordance with the wishes of Government expressed in G.O., No. 224, of 7th March 1893, Revenue, a report on this subject will not be submitted until later on. (b) Issue of jalap powders with the quinine.-The 200 packets or 10,000 jalap powders received from the Madras Medical Stores Department in July 1891 for issue with the quinine was exhausted in December last. Since then the stock of these jalap powders has not been replenished, as the question, whether the joint issue of the jalap with the quinine should be continued or not, is still under the consideration of Govern- ment. (c) Imperial Institute.-In August last twenty-five pounds of each of the following kinds of bark were sent to Mr. E. Thurston, Calcutta, for the Imperial Institute:- (1) Natural crown. (2) Mossed do. (3) Renewed do. (4) Natural red. (5) Mossed red. (6) Renewed do. (7) Natural magnifolia. (d)Mr. Hooper's leave.-In accordance with the sanction of Government accorded in G.O., No. 4412, dated the 11th October 1892, Revenue, Mr. Hooper, the Government Quinologist, took three months' leave from the 25th October 1892 and returned to duty on the 25th January 1893. (e)Gun licenses.-Hitherto no licenses under the Arms Act were obtained for the possession of fire arms by the watchers or the messengers sent to bring money to the Nedivattam and Pvkara estates from Ootacamund, but in G.O., No. 2014, of 26th October 1892, Judicial, Government considered it unnecessary and inexpedient to sanction the further continuance of these persons being exempted under the Arms Act, and so licenses were obtained from the District Magistrate, Nilgiris, and these will be renewed as becomes necessary. (f)Statements accompanying the report.-Two returns prepared for the first time in this office are furnished in accordance with the wishes of Government conveyed in G.O., No. 4740, dated 28th October 1892, Revenue. With regard to statement No. 12, it is suggested that for the future a less complicated form should be adopted. In 1883, when the present one was drawn up, the crude bark was, so

The expenditure has, therefore, been Rs. 4,6772 28TH JUNE 1893, Nos. 576, 576A, 576B, 576C, REVENUE (b) Nedivattam.-On this estate an unsually small quantity of rain was regis- tered during the past year, the total amount gauged being only 77.12 inches. This was less than what fell the year before by 23.72 inches and less than the average for the past ten years by 16.24 inches. As stated above under "general remarks," gloomy skies and constant drizzle were the characteristics of the season from the 25th of May to the end of October. The result of this want of sun was most damag- ing to the plants which had been put out in the early part of the year-a large number of these rotted off during the months of September and October. Heavy winds occurred during September and October and did a good deal of damage to the older trees on the estate. (c) Pykara-(1) Hooker.-On this plantation 70.81 inches of rain were regis- tered and was spread over 164 days. This was 4.75 inches less than what had been gauged the year before, and 18.51 inches below the average fall for the past ten years. July was the wettest month in the year, though less rain fell in that month than happened in the year before. An unusually large amount was registered during March. (2) Wood.-The amount of rain registered on this plantation was 56.81 inches, spread over 163 days. This was 5.94 inches less than what had been gauged during the previous year and 13.47 inches less than the average amount for the past ten. years. July was the wettest month, in fact over one-third of the total quantity of rain gauged for the whole year fell during this month alone. Here too, as at Hooker, an unusually large amount of rain fell in March last. II. FINANCIAL -(a) Receipts -When framing the budget estimate for 1892-93 it was originally calculated that only Rs.60,600 worth of quinine and febrifuge would be sold during the year, and this calculation was based on the value of the indents which had been received during the previous year. Subsequently, however, owing to additional indents having been sent in, it was proposed to raise the estimate from Rs.60,600 to Rs.71,000; but Government thought that even this figure was too low and so raised it to Rs.90,000-vide G.O., No.1116 of 23rd November 1891, Revenue. When the time came for revising the estimate, it was found that Rs.90,000 would not be realised; first, because the Government of Ceylon had notified their intention of buying no more quinine from this department; and, secondly, because the price of quinine had been reduced from Rs.14-11-3 to Rs.13-6-0. Under these circum- stances, although it was proposed to allow the receipts to stand at Rs. 90,000, it was distinctly intimated that the realisation of this sum could not be guaranteed; and Government, therefore, reduced the estimate to Rs.85,000-vide G.O., No.1101 of 28th October 1892, Revenue. The actual receipts amounted to only Rs.72,798-1-2, as detailed below:- Rs.A.P. Value of quinine supplied to the Medical Stores Depart- ments of Madras, Bombay and Mysore 41,636129 Value of febrifuge issued to the Medical Store Departments of Madras, Bombay and private parties 30,10020 Bark sold to the Medical Stores Departments of Madras, Bombay, Mysore and private parties 9261410 Miscellaneous, viz., sale of seed and plants, percentage of the fees of the Government Quinologist, &c. 13437 Total 72,79812 but this sum (Rs.72,798-1-2)does not include the value of 1,410 packets of quinine powders distributed to Collectors on their indents during the year; taking this into account, the total receipts have been Rs.74,208-1-2 or Rs.15,791-14-10 less than the budget, and Rs.10,791-14-10 less than the revised estimate. (b) Expenditure.-The budget estimate of expenditure was calculated originally at Rs.82,800, but Government raised this sum to Rs.83,000 (vide G.O., No. 1116 of 23rd November 1891, Revenue), and again in the revised estimate, the same figure was allowed to stand-vide G.O., No.1101 of 28th October 1892, Revenue. The actual expenditure during the year was Rs.78,885-11-8 or Rs.4,114-4-4 below the budget and revised estimates. This, however, does not include Rs.1,500 due to the Government Quinologist as his salary while on privilege leave; this sum was

The Chemical Examiner at Madras reported that these balls contained the starch of several kinds of grains as ragi, rice, &c., with a few yeast cells; he also suspected traces of a resin like that of cannabis (Indian Hemp). Several sonte soru balls were sent to me by Mr. Hollingsworth of the Madras Medical College. They were about the size of a plum, covered with a hard coating of flour, and weigh- ing about 100 grains each. Inside were chaffy scales mixed with white starch like coarsely powdered seeds or ground paddy. Examined under the microscope, the starch granules appeared to be small and angular, like those of rice, and the branching mycelium of some kind of fungus was present. The balls had a slight malt-like odour. A chemical examination of the powdered balls revealed the presence of 9.2 per cent. of moisture and 28.4 per cent. of mineral matter. The mineral matter or ash contained a large proportion of sand. A fat, a brown saccharine substance of the nature of glucose, albumen, soluble salts and malt extract were also present. No alkaloid or resin of Indian hemp was detected. The action of a body allied to diastase was assured by digesting some of the powdered balls in water at a temperature of 40°6TH JULY 1894, Nos. 481, 481A, 481B, 481C, REVENUE. 7 Indian squills.8 6TH JULY 1894, Nos. 481, 481A, 481B, 481C, REVENUE.

HOOPER, Esq., F.C.S., F.I.C., F.L.S., Government Quinologist, to Government Botanist and Director, Cinchona Plantations, Nilgiris, dated Ootacamund, 15th May 1895. I have the honour to make the following report on the analytical work conducted in the Laboratory during the year ending 31st March 1895. The products of cinchona bark manufactured at the factory at Nedivattam have been tested as usual, and I am glad to be able to report favourably upon all the samples but one batch of febrifuge which was returned for re-purifying. This febrifuge was found not to be up to the standard in colour and consistence. The sulphate of quinine contained no excess of sulphate of cinchonidine and was free from other impurities. Sulphate of cinchonidine of very good quality has been made for the first time this year to meet the requirements of some of the Presidency dispensaries. The packets of quinine powders have been put up under my supervision and distributed to some of the Collectors. The packets of quinine envelopes for distribution to the Post offices are now being made up in accordance with G.O. No. 4556 of 22nd November 1894, Revenue, but the scheme will not be established until further arrangements have been made with the Postmaster-General. A few analyses have been conducted of crown barks which are of interest in showing that manure has the effect of sustaining a high percentage of alkaloids in cinchona barks. It has been already shown by actual experiments, recorded in previous reports, that fish, bones, lime, cattle and stable manure have a beneficial influence on the trees in producing a richer bark than that from trees grown in natural soil. The following analyses of crown barks show that the application of saltpetre increased the alkaloids to an extent far beyond the average amount usually found in this species of cinchona:27TH JUNE 1895, No. 407, REVENUE. 9 Jalap.10 27TH JUNE 1895, No. 407, REVENUE. in potash. With regard to this plant it should be noticed that it contains a poisonous alkaloid, erythrine, which would render it injurious to cattle if they fed upon the leaves in any quantity.

Speaking of the latter estate, Mr. Lawson states that the portions which were abandoned some eight years ago might with advantage be taken in hand again and replanted. It would appear that at present the greater portion of the estates included in the Nedivattam reserve are either intentionally left waste or unfit for cinchona cultivation and the advisability of placing such portions as are not required or likely to be required by the Cinchona Department under the control of the Forest Department is now under the consideration of Government. 4. The following statement shows the quantities of bark, quinine and febrifuge in stock at the beginning and at the end of the year, with the additions and disposals made during the interval:24 27TH JUNE 1895, No. 407, REVENUE. packing quinine was communicated only in February last, and that orders were there- upon issued to the Superintendent, Government Press, to have the necessary number of covers manufactured and transmitted to the Director's office at Ootacamund " at a very early date." The Superintendent has since reported that he has already sent 35,000 covers to Mr. Lawson and that he has made arrangements to send the remaining covers in weekly instalments until the number required is completed. 7. The total receipts of the year amounted to Rs. 77,494 or including the value of the quinine packets issued to Rs. 79,144, while the total expenditure during the same period was Rs. 78,311 as against Rs. 82,000 and Rs. 84,200, the sanc- tioned figures under the two heads respectively. A further sum of Rs. 1,514 was due for quinine and febrifuge supplied to certain local fund and municipal dispensaries towards the close of the year. Government notes with satisfaction that taking the second figure given above under receipts, the working of the plantations exhibited a small surplus, whereas the balance has usually been on the other side. It is hoped that this improvement in the financial condition of the department will be maintained. 8. The Government has read with interest Mr. Hooper's report on the analytical work done by him during 1894-95. (True Extract.) (Signed) E. GIBSON, Secretary to Government. To the Government Botanist.

In June the rainfall was 29.85 inches, while in the year before it was only 13.19 inches; in other respects the rainfall and number of wet days corresponded with those recorded during the seasons of 1894-95.

The price of the acid sent by the Secretary of State also was higher than anticipated by this office (G.O., No. 1559, Revenue, dated the 24th April 1896). It was found therefore at the close of the year that the cost of the deputation of Dr. King would considerably straiten the finances of the Cinchona department; and to avoid a deficit, an additional grant was given under re-appropriations as specified in G.O., No. 139, Financial, dated 3rd March 1896, of Rs. 2,500, thus raising the additional grant from Rs. 82,400 to Rs. 84,900.

It has been found that the entire coppicing of a plot often results in failure due to the absence of suitable protection for the young shoots. (b) Nedivattam.5 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. The analyses of some barks from the Dodabetta Plantation show that, in some cases, the stimulating effect of the manure is only temporary. A large number of trees were some years ago manured with fish, cattle dung and bone meal. The best results were obtained in plot 30, where fish had been applied in the proportion of 2½ pounds to a tree. The barks were analysed in 1890, or two years after the manure had been put down. No manure has been given to this plot since that time; but to see if the richness had been maintained, a sample of the bark was analysed in October 1895, with the result that there was a decided diminution of alkaloids. The following are the analyses referred to: 6 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. IX. FACTORY.7 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. As evidence of the expansion of the distribution of quinine by this office during the past official year, quinine was asked for and sent out to the Native State of Kar- bhari-Janjera in Scinde (north-west of India), to Tinnevelly (south), to Bombay (west), to Ganjám (east). The Bengal Government has taken 1,500 lb. of quinine for Calcutta and the Medical Storekeeper, Mian Mir. The Province of Burma, too, has drawn its supply of quinine from Madras.

Standen was appointed Director of the newly constituted Cinchona Department. 3. The scheme referred to was decided upon after consultation with Brigade- Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel George King of the Bengal Cinchona Department, whose interesting report on his inspection of the Government Cinchona Plantations and valuable suggestions for their future management will be found printed as an appendix to these Proceedings. From this report it appeared that the work, devolving in recent years on the Government Quinologist, who was first entertained in 1884, was not sufficient to justify the retention of a full-time chemist. It was accordingly decided, with the permission of the Government of Indian, to abolish the appointment altogether with effect from 23rd May 1897, the Director being from that date placed in immediate and sole charge of the manufacture of quinine. 4. The several Government estates and the factory at Nedivattam being in charge of a subordinate executive in which no change was contemplated, the delay in coming to a decision in regard to the separation of the Cinchona and Botanical Depart- ments did not affect the administration during the year under review. Financially the year was a conspicuous success and the condition of the several plantations except the "Wood" estate, which was given up towards the close of the year, was excellent. 5. The rainfall was good, being considerably above that registered. in the previous year, and, though in January last a severe frost killed over 3,000 trees in the Doda- betta estate, the season appears to have been on the whole favourable to the cultivation of cinchona. The number of trees standing on the several estates at the commence- ment of the year was 1,723,468 and the number coppiced or uprooted during the year 71,136, leaving a balance of 1,652,032 at the close of the year. From statement 7 appended to the present report, it appears that 21,034 of these were standing on the " Wood " estate. They are not however taken into account in the totals given in the last column of the statement, and in the body of the report, paragraph III (2), it is stated that all the trees on this estate were cut down or uprooted. The Director will accordingly be requested to state whether the 21,034 trees referred to were cut down or are still standing. 6. From the same statement it appears that no trees were newly planted during the year and a scrutiny of previous reports would seem to indicate that planting opera- tions have been at a stand-still since 1892. The Government observes, however, that in the body of the report, reference is made to the putting out of "8,000 renewal" at Nedivattam, and 7,750 officinalis plants on the Hooker estate. It should be explained why these figures are not entered in statement No. 7. Both Dr. King and Mr. Lawson recommended that the plantation should be worked on a rotation of twenty years from which it would appear that a considerable area requires annually to be replanted. A special supply of fresh seed has recently been obtained from Jamaica for this purpose and the Director will now be requested to report what action he pro- poses to take in the matter of planting fresh or replanting uprooted areas in the several estates. In this connection, the Government notes that in his letter No. 52, dated 23rd May 1896, Mr. Hooper reported that the quantity of seed received from Jamaica was 8 lb. 5¾ oz., whereas in paragraph XI (a) of the report under review it is stated that only " about two pounds " have been received. The discrepancy should be explained. 7. The following statement shows the amount of Cinchona bark, quinine and febrifuge in stock at the beginning of the year, the additions made thereto and the quantities disposed of during the year and the balance on hand at its close: No.350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. 23 The figures given in this statement, except for the balance of sulphate of quinine shown in the last column, have been taken from the report under review. As regards the sulphate of quinine, however, Mr. Hooper states that the stock outstanding at the end of the year was 2,880 lb. excluding "60 lb." dryage. So far as the Govern- ment is aware "dryage" has not been referred to in preceding reports as a cause of diminution in the stock; the allowance now made on this account appears to be exces- sive and should be explained. 8. The quantity of sulphate of quinine manufactured during the year was about 1,000 lb. less than in the previous year while that sold (5,644 lb.) was over 2,000 lb. more than in any preceding year. The small outturn in the factory is reported to be due to the late arrival of fusel oil from England while the increase in the sales is chiefly attributable to an indent for 1,500 lb. received from the Calcutta Medical Stores Department. From the present report it is not apparent what quantities of quinine and febrifuge were sold to the public at large. The Government desires that in future reports this information as well as the details of the several other items given under the heading " Quinine " in paragraph IX should be separately furnished. 9. An important feature in the year's administration was the extension of the sale of quinine packets by the postal agency. The system was at first introduced into five districts as an experimental measure and on receipt of a report showing the results of the experiment it was in January last resolved to extend the system to the other districts in the Presidency (with the exception of Madras and Chingleput), as also, at the request of the Chief Commissioner, to the Province of Coorg. The total number of packets issued to post offices during the year was 4,079 while 2,638 were distributed to Collectors, &c. The details of the sales effected will be reviewed when the separate report on the subject called for in G.O., No. 224, dated 7th March 1893, is received. 10. The total receipts during the year amounted to Rs. 1,02,882, excluding the price of packets issued to Postmasters and Collectors, and Rs. 1,08,696 inclusive thereof, against a budget estimate of Rs. 65,000 and a revised estimate of Rs. 1,00,000. During the twelve years of the late Mr. Lawson's administration of the Department the former amount was slightly exceeded only once, in 188524 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1986. Dr. King who has inspected the plantations on two occasions prior to 1884 it is clear that their condition has greatly improved during Mr. Lawson's tenure of office, a result which is to be ascribed to his administration.

APPENDIX. Report on the Cinchona Plantations and Factory of the Madras Government. 1. I have, during my present visit to the Nilgiri Hills, gone over and carefully examined the plantations at Dodabetta and Nedivattam and the one near the Pykara river named the Hooker estate. I visited these estates originally in 1871 and, in company with the late Mr. McIvor and Mr. Broughton, made a prolonged and minute inspection of them. And again in 1878 I made an equally thorough inspection of them in connection with the Commission appointed by Government to enquire into their condition and prospects. During my present inspection I have therefore had the advantage of the knowledge and experience acquired during these earlier visits. 2. Government are familiar, from the reports of the Director, with the composition (as regards the kinds of cinchona grown) of these plantations. It is therefore unnecessary for me to do more than remind you generally that on the four plantations practically only three kinds of cinchona are cultivated. The Dodabetta plantation is essentially one of crown (or officinalis) bark, there being more than half a million trees of that sort on it and only about sixty thousand of the sort known as " hybrid "; while there are no trees whatever of the red bark (cinchona succirubra). The Nedivattam plantation, on the other hand, consists of about a quarter of a million hybrid trees of 89,000 crown barks and of 25,000 red barks. The Hooker plantation is composed of 373,000 crown barks, 293,000 hybrids and 2,300 red barks; while the Wood plantation consists of about 42,000 hybrids. Distributed over all four estates there are 1,188 trees of various kinds of cinchona which have been raised from seeds from time to time sent out by the India Office for experimental cultivation. These are now cultivated merely as curiosities, as they have all been proved to be without value as sources of quinine on the Nilgiri Hills. I therefore omit them from further consideration. As Government are aware it has from a very early period in the history of the cultivation of the medicinal cinchonas in these hills been known and recognised that the best bark to grow for the manu- facture of quinine is the crown or officinalis sort. It has been equally well-known that the red or succirubra bark is one which contains a larger proportion of the inferior alkaloids, cinchonidine and cinchonine; and which, while affording an excellent raw material for the manufacture of cinchona febrifuge, is an inferior raw material for quinine. The sorts known as hybrids are trees which, while inferior as quinine yielders, to the crown barks, are superior to red barks. For various reasons the cultivation of these hybrids was much favoured by the late Mr. McIvor, and it is this fact which accounts for the large proportion of them which still exists on the Government estates. Experience since Mr. McIvor's time has proved that these hybrids are, in the Nilgiris, short-lived trees; and that their bark, by reason of the presence in it of so much cinchonidine and cinchonine, is as a raw material for quinine manufacture much inferior to crown bark. The latter is, moreover, also much more hardy than hybrid. The policy of Mr. Lawson has therefore been steadily to reduce the numbers of both hybrids and red barks in the estates, and to replant the areas cleared of these with crown barks. This policy has been carried out to such an extent that at present
No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. 25 there are on the four Government estates only about 27,952 red barks and 663,323 hybrids, as against 1,031,005 crown barks. Of this policy I entirely approve, and I would recommend its continuance until the estates contain nothing but crown barks. With the object, however, of keeping up the strain of the latter which appears to have slightly deteriorated of recent years, I would support the recommendation made to Government by the Director to the effect that arrangements should be made for the importation from the natural home of the crown bark in the forests of Loxa in the province of Ecuador of a few pounds of good fresh seed of that species. 3. From the preceding remarks it will appear that the Dodabetta plantation is the most valuable of the four and that the Hooker plantation ranks next in value. The Nedivattam plantation has, from the preponderance upon it of hybrid and red barks, a considerably less value at present; but, if the policy be carried out of replacing these by crown barks, it may soon become equally valuable with the two previously mentioned. And at present it is of great importance from the presence on it of the Quinine and Febrifuge Factory. The Wood planta- tion is, both as regards extent and composition, the least valuable of all four. It consists at present of a small patch (27 acres) of hybrid bark trees; it is inconveniently separated from the other three by the Pykara stream; and in fact the chief argument for its retention appears to be that there is on it a bungalow fit for a European Superintendent to live in, whereas on the Hooker estate there is no such accommodation. The patch of cinchona on the Wood estate is so small, and so exposed to the ravages of game that I would root it up and abandon it. I shall, however, refer to this matter more fully in a subsequent paragraph. 4. Management and mode of working the plantations.26 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. grinding of the bark is done by a Carter's disintegrater of which the motor power is a vortex turbine which, owing to deficiency of water during the dry season, can be worked only half the year. The disintegrater is, however, capable of grinding 4,000 lb. of bark per day; and, as it can be worked for 150 days in the year, 600,000 pounds of bark can be annually ground, an amount which is more than thrice as great as the vats in the factory are capable of converting into quinine or febrifuge. The factory buildings are, however, capable of extension whenever more vats are required to meet the demand for their outturn. At present the vats are capable of turning out annually only 4,800 lb. of quinine and about 3,000 of febrifugeNo. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. 27 much as I sympathise with the objects of the Association, I must say that the grievances complained of by it are chiefly matters of the past. I fail to see how the proceedings of a single shikari, spread over three such large areas, can be very destructive to game. And I cannot understand how, in the face of the existing evidence, both oral and ocular, it can be contended that game in the neighbourhood of the Cinchona plantations has been virtually exterminated. This is not the opinion of a large cinchona and tea planter in the neighbourhood who assured me the other day that sambur and jungle sheep literally swarm at a distance of 3½ miles from Nedivattam. As the subject, however, appears to have elicited some warmth of feeling, I would suggest that the Wood plantation, where game most abound and where there are only 27 acres of cinchona, should be abandoned; the cinchona being first uprooted and its bark taken to the factory. I cannot recommend the dismissal of the shikari, but I would restrict him (as at present) to the actual area of the Government estates. 10. Accounts,28 No. 350, REVENUE, 23RD JULY 1896. three Government estates carry a grand total of 6 million pounds of dry bark.

During the year 17.75 acres were coppiced, the yield of dry bark being 65,066 lb. The number of plants put out during the year was 15,801 but these cannot be considered as additions to the estate as they served only to supply vacancies in the plantings of previous years. The estate has been well cultivated during the year, the different works have been carried out efficiently and at a moderate cost, and there is ample testimony in the satisfactory condition of the plantation to the good work done by the present Superintendent Mr. H.

The seeds were imported to remedy the deterioration of the plantation- bred crown bark plants which experts reported to be due partly to hybridisation and partly to climatic influences. This matter should receive the careful attention of the Director. The comparative success of the plants grown from the foreign and home seeds should be noted in future reports. The Director should also report whether the recommendation of the Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, to maintain a small plantation of stock of crown bark in an isolated position so as to render hybri- disation impossible has been tried and with what success. 6.

The oldest trees suffered little as they are less dependent on surface moisture than young plants. The frosts which were more severe than usual did comparatively little damage to the plantations. (a) Dodabetta.No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. 5 considered satisfactory. In the stock statement No. 11, the quinine and febrifuge in store as well as the bark have been valued at cost price, while the quinine held as stock by Revenue officials and Postmasters has been valued at its selling price. The introduction of this change has necessitated the re-valuing of the stock of quinine and febrifuge in hand on the 31st March 1697, the total value of all stock being reduced from Rs. 1,84,3676 No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. were re-coppiced some 3 or 4 years ago and are making exceedingly good growth. From the healthy appearance of these trees in their third rotation, there is every reason to suppose that if they are cut down in their 15th year, the shoots will be equal to a fourth rotation. It has yet to be proved whether the cinchona is a long- lived tree on the Nilgiris. The oldest trees on the plantations are now 36 years of age and appear likely to live for many years yet if cultivation is kept up. The largest tree on the Nedivattam estate, a succirubra, measures 46 inches in circumfer- ence at a height of 3 feet from the ground., and is looking very healthy and vigorous. Plots 14, 23 and 24, which contain young plants growing on old land, were weeded five times during the year. Plots 3, 4 5, 10, 16 and 26 were weeded twice, and the remaining plots were all deeply dug before the dry weather set in. The number of plants put out during the year to fill vacancies in plots 14, 23 and 24 was 75,216, and 454 plants were planted in a small piece of new land to contrast with those planted on old soil. At the end of the year these latter plants were looking very well. Every possible care was taken with the planting of the vacancies. Each pit was manured, the young plants which had been grown in plant baskets in the nurseries were care- fully planted, and immediately after the planting they were shaded with ferns. Notwithstanding these precautions a considerable number succumbed during the dry weather, whereas the plants put out on new land did well. In view of the above facts, it has been decided to spend no more money on the replanting of old land except for the purpose of experimenting on planting with shade. (c) Hooker.No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. 7 weeding and. digging given to the rest of the plantation. At the end of a year the 2,400 trees will be coppiced, and the bark yielded by each plot of 800 trees will be worked up separately in the Nedivattam factory. A careful account will be kept of all expenses incurred on each of the three plots from the time of the application of the manure, and the yield of quinine and febrifuge will be recorded for each plot. In this way it is hoped that it, will be possible to prove that when a cinchona estate is worked on a coppice rotation, it is highly profitable to adopt every possible means of enriching the bark before the trees are cut down. The 800 unmanured trees will probably yield 4,000 pound of bark analysing 4 per cent. or 160 lb. of quinine, and it is expected that each plot of manured trees will give 4,000 lb. of bark analysing 6 per cent. or 240 lb. of quinine. Taking the value of quinine at Rs. 10 per lb., the increased yield would be worth Rs. 800, while the total extra expenditure on each of the manured plots will not be much more than Rs. 180. So that there would be a profit of about Rs. 620 per acre if the sulphate of quinine was increased 50 per cent., i.e., from 4 per cent. to 6 per cent. An increase of rather less than ½ per cent. of quinine will., it is estimated, cover the cost of the manure, &c. In the next annual report details of the experiments will be given, and it is hoped that the results will be of interest to planters of cinchona who work their estates on the coppice system. The stimulus given by the manure should be of service in encouraging the growth from the stool when the tree has been cut down, and the application of manure 12 months before coppicing should thus serve a double purpose. V. NURSERIES.8 No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. arrangements would be made to extract febrifuge from the red barks by the acid process, and the importance of carrying on this work was enhanced when it was found that it would not be possible to make quinine until September. A suitable place was found for the manufacture, in the covered verandah of the bark store, water was laid on in piping through the whole length of the verandah, and 180 tubs were made for the bark and acid, liquor, &c. The manufacture of febrifuge from the red barks was started on the 1st June and from that date until the end of the year 114,650 lb. of red bark were used which yielded 4,304 lb. of febrifuge. The cost of the chemicals used per pound of febrifuge extracted from these barks was As. 15-11, while the chemicals and oils used for the extraction of quinine and febrifuge from the crown barks cost Rs. 1-8-1 for each pound of alkaloid. The febrifuge manufactured during the year was of very good colour, and the quinine, a sample of which was sent to the Chemical Examiner, Madras, was reported to contain a little over 5 per cent. of other cinchona alkaloids and 8 per cent. of moisture. The standard of purity for sulphate of quinine laid down by the British PharmacopNo. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. 9 The rates at which quinine and febrifuge were sold to the Medical Stores, Local Fund dispensaries and municipal hospitals were Rs. 11 per lb. and Rs. 10 per lb., respectively. The former figure is the lowest at which quinine has been supplied by this department, and is the lowest figure ever paid by the Medical Stores, &c., for sulphate of quinine. The price fixed by Government for sale to the public was Rs. 18 per lb. which is the same rate as that fixed for the preceding year. Quinine.10 No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. was abolished with effect from 1st July. A compensation gratuity of Rs. 340 was granted to Mr. McFeat on his retirement, and the estate was placed under the charge of the Superintendent of Nedivattam. Changes were also made in the staff of the Head office which took effect from the 1st June. (b) Issue of quinine packets to Collectors.No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. 11 (g) Subordinate staff12.

In parts III and IV of his report the Director discusses the interesting ques- tions of replanting land which has already borne a crop of cinchona, of regeneration from coppice, and of the utility of manuring. With regard to the question of replanting, the results of the experiments made on the Neduvattam estate appear to establish the inexpediency of endeavouring to replant old land with success as long as new land is available. The Government, however, approves of the Director's proposal to try the experiment of replanting old land under shade. The facts noted by the Director as to the regenerative power of the stools in certain plots certainly warrant the hope that under careful cultivation the cinchona on the Nilgiris will undergo four rotations by coppice without loss of vitality. An equally important question in working a cinchona estate on a system of coppice rotation is whether a large outlay on manuring will be profitable. Mr. Standen has selected three plots bearing 800 trees each. Two of the plots have been highly manured and the third left unmanured. Careful accounts of the expenditure and return from three plots will be kept, and Mr. Standen anticipates that not only will the direct return from the manured trees, when coppiced, be greater than from those unmanured, but that the stools on these plots will exhibit a greater vitality and re- generative power. The results of the experiments will be awaited with interest. 4. Coppicing and thinning operations during the year were confined to sickly trees on ridges and poor soil and to trees on replanted land. The total amount of bark harvested during the year was thus only 128,349 lbs. from 118,683 trees as against 186,867 lbs. from 23,840 trees in the previous year. The yield of the plantations was supplemented by the purchase of 108,934 lbs. of bark in the local market. Adding the stock of bark on hand at the close of the previous year, the total amount of bark available for manufacture during the year was 484,034 lbs. 5. The following statement shows the quantities of bark, quinine and febrifuge, in stock at the beginning of the year, the additions made thereto, and the quantities disposed of during the year and the balance on hand at its close: 22 No. 426, REVENUE, 2ND AUGUST 1898. 6.The amount of quinine distributed during the year was the highest on record and exceeded the previous year's issues by 428 lbs. The sales of quinine packets by postal agency continued to show an increase, having amounted to 658½ lbs. against 628 lbs. in 1896-97. On the other hand, sales by the Revenue officers showed a further decrease. This matter will be further commented upon on receipt of the Director's detailed report on the sales under the pice-packet system. The demand of the Government medical depots for febrifuge fell considerably. The decision of the Government not to extend the area under succirubras has thus been fully justified. 7. The total receipts and charges amounted to Rs. 98,464 and Rs. 95,300, respec- tively, against Rs. 1,47,310 and Rs. 82,549 in 1896-97. The fall in receipts was mainly due to the fact that the price of quinine supplied to Government medical depots was reduced from Rs. 18 in 1896-97 to Rs. 11 in the year under review. The financial condition of the plantations is exhibited in statements Nos. 10,11 and 12 appended to the report. From the balance sheet (statement No. 12) it appears that the profit on the year's working amounted to Rs. 32,852-15-10. 8. The thanks of the Government are due to Mr. Standen for his efficient working of the plantations and factory luring the year. The Government is also pleased to notice the testimony borne by the Director to the good work done by his subordinates. (True Extract.) (Signed) G. S. FORBES, Secretary to Government.
