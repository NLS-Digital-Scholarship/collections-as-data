MacGregor of the Indian Civil Verterinary Department remained under training throughout the year. The sanctioned appointment of a second Imperial Officer to this college is at present vacant. Mr. S. C. Pal, the Chief Glanders Inspector, acted as a Lecturer in con- sequence of the temporary promotion of Mr. D. Dey to the post of Assistant Principal, on furlough. During the summer vacation, Deputy Superintendent S. N. Mitra was deputed to the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar. to enlarge his experience in Serum Therapy. Laboratory Technique and Inoculation work. Again in the cold weather, Deputy Superintendent S. K. Mitra and Veterinary Inspector B. N. Das Gupta were deputed, as an experimental measure, to Bombay and the Punjab to improve their knowledge of " Bovines " and to enlarge their experience. This, in my opinion, has been a sueeess. A special report has been submitted to Government. 28. Public Works Department Works.4 Ishapore. Prompt attention was given to all outbreaks. A sum of Rs. 390-8 was realised on account of the anti-rinderpest serum used and credited to Government. 5. While the Presidency Remount Depot remained closed from 27th February to 8th September 1914, 505 horses and one cow were inspected on boardship. No clinical symptom of any infectious disease was found. 6. At the instance of the Health Officer of the Corporation of Calcutta, 84 calves were put to the tuberculin test at the Animal Vaccine Depot, Ballygunge ; of these only two reacted. 7. All the byres in the Glanders area were systematically inspected. 8. Rabies has been very prevalent in Calcutta during the year under report. One hundred and sixty dogs and 124 carcasses of dogs from Calcutta and elsewhere were examined for rabies, and 187 proved to be suffering from the disease. 9. Inspections of bides intended for shipment to different foreign ports were made during the year. THE RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY. The work of the Laboratory was satisfactory as in previous years. 2. Pathological and other specimens continued to be received from the Civil Veterinary Departments of Bengal and Bihar and Orissa, Army Depart- ment, European and Indian practitioners and other gentlemen. Autopsies were made on carcasses received from the Bengal and Calcutta Police, Zoolo- gical Garden, Calcutta Corporation, Church of England Zenana Mission, Army Transport Department and other sources. 3. Morbid materials and specimens were supplied to the Imperial Bacteriologist, Imperial Serologist and Major C. A. Lane, I.M.S., for their work. 4. Surra which broke out in 12th Cavalry, Ballygunge, was microscopi- cally diagnosed. Samples of bone-meal were bacteriologically examined for the detection of anthrax and other organisms. 5. Auto-vaccine was prepared in the Laboratory with which some newly-imported horses of the Army Remount Depôt were successfully treated. Preventive vaccine for Fowl-Cholera was also prepared with which the healthy monal pheasants of the Zoological Garden among which Fowl-Cholera broke out were inoculated with satisfactory results. 6. Some lantern slides of symptoms of different kinds of contagious disease among cattle were prepared with the object of exhibiting them in cattle fairs and shows in the hopes that by this means the people may be encouraged to take more interest in the veterinary profession. 7. The following papers were published with the concurrence of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India :TABLE I Showing the main results and the receipts and expenditure of the Bengal Veterinary College during the year 1914-15.

[Maximum limit, 8 pages.] TABLE OF CONTENTS. --------ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE YEAR 1914-1915. PREFACE and General Administration. I HELD charge of the department throughout the year. I was on tour 112 days and travelled 290 miles by road, 7.909 by rail and 770 by river. Mr. MacGregor, officer on training at the Bengal Veterinary College, accompanied me on tour for training in district work during the college vacation in April, May and June. Serampore Municipality ... 1 Maida District Board ... 1 Dacca Municipality ... 1 Barisal District Board ... 2 Noakhali District Board ... 1 There were 69 veterinary assistants working in the province. I inspected about half of these men and interviewed the local authorities con- cerned with a view to obtain their co-operation in the work of extending the department. The local authorities named in the margin employed 6 more veterinary assistants during the year. Fifteen more veterinary assistants in the districts named below have also been sanctioned and applications for 3 more assistants are now pending receipt of Government sanction. 24-Parganas ... ... ... ... 1 Burdwan ... ... ... ... 1 Murshidabad ... ... ... ... 2 Mymensingh ... ... ... ... 1 Rajshahi ... ... ... ... 0 Rangpur ... ... ... ... 2 Jessore ... ... ... ... 1 Jalpaiguri ... ... ... ... 2 Tippera ... ... ... ... 2 Bankura ... ... ... ... 1 My routine inspection tours have rather suffered this year owing to my being called back to attend glanders outbreaks, and also through the necessity arising for my revisiting places several times2 I attended the Agricultural Conference at Rangpur and inspected the Rangpur Farm three times and the Kalimpong Farm once. I went to the Garo Hills in January to purchase some breeding bulls required by several District Boards, but no suitable bulls were available. In addition to inspection work, I attended outbreaks of glanders at Chinsura, Rangpur, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Berhampore. Part I3 Bovine. Rinderpest.4 In some districts such as Burdwan, Murshidabad, Hooghly, Barisal, Rangpur, the people in the rural tracts are still opposed to this method of treatment, but the good results obtained and the gradual development of the department will, I think, gradully overcome their prejudices. Rupees 9,687-8 was paid during the year to the Imperial Bacteriologist on account of the cost of serum supplied. Of this, Rs. 3,504-8 is recoverable under orders of Government from the districts in West Bengal, named below, at 2 annas per dose of serum used. Rs.

Table IV. Table IV shows the work of the itinerant veterinary assistants during the year. There were 44 itinerant veterinary assistants working in the province and 14 stationary veterinary assistants placed in charge of dispensaries who toured in the interior either at fixed periods or at the time of outbreaks. The number of cases treated increased from 50,598 to 53.287. or an increase of 2,689 and the number of villages visited by them from 9.810 to 10,189. In the following districts there is a decrease from last year principally due to foot-and-mouth disease being less prevalent :5 The total number of cases treated at the dispensaries was 24,049 against 21,503 of the previous year. The addition of the new dispensaries may account for a part of this increase. The increase against Chinsurah, Mymensingh and Chittagong is due to the increased popularity of the institu- tions and is a credit to the ability of the veterinary assistants employed there. The large falling-oil noticed against Tippera Dispensary is due to the absence of foot-and-mouth disease in the neighbourhood, of which 315 cases only were treated by the veterinary assistant this year against 1,798 of the previous year. Opening of dispensaries at Bagerhat, Satkhira, Berhampore, Midnapore, Alipore, Rajshahi, Barisal is now under consideration of the District Boards concerned. Part III6 Inspectors.7 This system might improve if chaukidars in villages were encouraged in- this respect by giving some remuneration out of the Chaukidari Fund for all verified outbreaks promptly reported.

S PressREVENUE DEPARTMENT. ----------2 4. The report of the Civil Veterinary Department shows an increase in the mortality of animals from contagious diseases during the year, the total number of deaths reported being 15,950, as against 13,136 in the previous year. The increase is attributed to the more accurate record of deaths kept by the police in most districts, and partly also to an improvement in many districts in the reporting of the outbreaks of cattle diseases. Though the number of deaths amongst equines from the principal contagious diseases fell again from 279 in the preceding year to 229, the number of deaths among bovines increased from 12,847 to 15,707. The increase in the latter case is attributed to the fact that rinderpest was, as usual, fairly prevalent throughout the province, the districts most seriously affected being Mymen- singh, Dacca, Rangpur, Tippera, Burdwan, Midnapore, Murshidabad and the 24-Parganas, and the mortality from this disease alone being 13,662 as against 10.318 in the previous year. The heavy mortality is ascribed to the late receipt or non-receipt of reports, stoppage of the supply of serum for some time at the beginning of the year, and to the prejudice of cultivators against inoculation. Another cause which is reported to tend to the spread of the disease is the indiscriminate removal of the hides of the animals which die of this disease. There were 340 outbreaks of this disease in the area outside Calcutta and its suburbs, resulting in the death of 4,584 unino- culated animals, while out of 37,813 animals, which were inoculated, only 221 or about 0.6 per cent. died. Similarly there were only three deaths among 1,958 animals inoculated for h3 and sixty-seven deaths occurred in the Sodepur Pinjrapole alone. The outbreaks were very severe also in the four districts, Hooghly, Murshidabad, Darjeeling and Rangpur. 7. Six new dispensaries wore opened during the year making a total of 24, all of which were inspected either by the Superintendent or the circle inspectors, except those at Sodepur Pinjrapole, Howrah and Cooch Behar, which are under private management. The total number of patients treated at 23 dispensaries was 24,049 against 21.503 in the previous year. The dispensary at Cooch Behar remained closed during the early part of the year for want of a suitable veterinary assistant. Since the close of the year sanction has been given to the transfer, on certain conditions, of the services of an assistant on Rs. 30 per mensem for the dispensary, who will be paid by the Cooch Behar State, but will work under the supervision and inspection of the Veterinary Department. There is evidence of good work in all dispensaries in the province, especially in the dispensaries at Chittagong, Mymensingh and Chinsura. The establishment of a Veterinary Hospital at Dacca was sanctioned last year, but the building work is being delayed owing to difficulties in connection with the site. A part of the land acquired for the purpose being required by the Eastern Bengal State Railway, the department is considering whether the remaining area will be sufficient for the requirements of the dispensary, or whether the whole site should be abandoned and a new site selected. 8. Only 220 animals were sent for treatment to the Bengal Veterinary College Hospital in connection with cases under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act during the year, though 8,455 prosecutions were instituted under the Act. The number of animals sent for treatment at the hospital still continues to be small in comparison with the number of prosecutions instituted. The question has been engaging the attention of Government for some time, and a committee was appointed to consider whether any improvement was possible in the law of cruelty to animals, its administration and the present system under which public and private agencies co-operate in the suppression of cruelty. The committee submitted its report after the close of the year. 9. The question of the improvement of the breed of cattle continued to engage the attention of the Director of Agriculture and of the Superintendent of the Civil Veterinary Department. It is reported that persistent efforts are being made by the officers of the department to impress on the minds of cultivators and owners of cattle generally the advantage of and the urgent need for care in the breeding and management of cattle, though with very little appreciable result. His Excellency in Council notices with regret that though applications were received during the year from several District Boards for good bulls, no suitable animals could be procured and supplied by the Superintendent. 10. The cost of anti-rinderpest serum supplied to local bodies in Eastern Bengal districts was hitherto borne by Government. In Western Bengal districts, however, the District Boards pay for the serum supplied to them. As the cost of serum is a proper local charge, Government has decided that the local bodies in Eastern Bengal districts should also be required to pay for the serum they use. 11. A proposal submitted by the Director of Agriculture for the appoint- ment of a Deputy Superintendent for the Civil Veterinary Department was sanctioned after the close of the year. 12. Orders have been passed since the close of the year on the proposals for the co-ordination of the different rates of pay and allowances of veterinary assistants and veterinary inspectors obtaining in the two parts of the Presidency. The pay of veterinary assistants in the two Western Bengal Divisions was Rs. 304 Western Bengal were arranged in seven grades ranging from Rs. 70 to Rs. 150, while in Eastern Bengal their pay was Rs. 100ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE AND OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE YEAR 1914-1915.
