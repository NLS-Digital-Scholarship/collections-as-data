FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF INDIA. YEAR after year, with almost monotonous regularity, the Central Committee have reported an increase in the number of patients treated in the Institute. The year 1914 was no exception to the rule: the number of cases treated rose from 3,984 in 1913 to 4,585 in the year under report. The steady rise in popularity of the Institute since its inception in August 1900 to the present time is well shown in the following table:2 Of the 4,585 persons treated in 1914, 4,124 were Indians and 461 Europeans. In addition to the routine rabies work, some valuable research work has been carried out in the Institute by Captains H. W. Acton and R. Knowles, notably an investigation on the treatment of snake bite, and a research into the life-history of the halteridium parasite of the pigeon. During 1914 a fourth row of quarters for indigent patients was completed: accommodation for this class of patient is still, however, insufficient and more will have to be provided in the near future. The Middle Class quarters were also com- pleted. The Rabies Hospital is in course of construction and will be soon ready for occupation. It will fill a long-felt want. The estimated cost of this building is Rs. 10,815. Three new rabbit houses have been built and a refrigerating plant has been installed. Various other extensions and alterations have been effected. These have been rendered possible by a grant of Rs. 19,700 generously given by the Indian Research Fund Association. Captain H. W. Acton, I.M.S., assisted by Captain R. Knowles, I.M.S., was in charge of the Institute from the 1st January to the 7th September, when Major A. G. McKendrick became Director. To all of these officers the thanks of the Central Committee are due for the efficient management of the Institute. A statement of accounts is appended. F.

During the period under review 4,585 persons received treatment, in compari- son with 3,980 in the previous year. Of these 4,124 were Indians as compared with 3,532 in 1913 and 461 were Europeans as compared with 448 in the previous year. In the case of 297 persons treatment was not considered necessary, or was discon- tinued on the receipt of information that the biting animal had proved its inno- cuousness by living in health for 10 days after the bite had been inflicted. Of these 86, 85, 53, and 73 occurred in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of the year respectively. It will thus be seen that a considerable increase in the influx of patients has occurred: and that this increase is principally due to the Indian element. Of those who received treatment 53 (including 1 European) contracted the disease. These may be classified as follows:7 fundamental importance in the consideration of measures for controlling the disease. IS RABIES ON THE INCREASE IN INDIA ? The first of these is the question as to whether rabies has in any way varied in India of late years. Have we to face an increasing menace ? or is this menace on the decrease, and going on to a natural obliteration ? or is the disease in a steady condition ? The second question is, what is the chance of infection occurring in a dog bitten by a rabid dog. The first of these is difficult to answer. Statistics show that since the in- auguration of both Indian Pasteur Institutes the influx of Indian patients has steadily increased. This is due in the main part to the rapid but steady spread of know- ledge of the benefits of treatment, and this tendency must naturally veil the effects of any perceptible variation in the prevalence of the disease. The European population for obvious reasons is not affected to the same degree by this tendency; but the influx of this class is subject to variations for which no counterpart exists in the statistics for natives coming from the area concerned. These fluctuations occur chiefly amongst those patients who have only been licked, and the control of this class has been found by all Directors of Pasteur Institutes to be a most for- midable task. From the statistics of this Institute, however, one set of figures can be extracted which is free from both of these fallacies. This is composed of the number of deaths from rabies which have occurred amongst Europeans who have presented themselves for treatment, and who have died during, or within fifteen days from the completion of, treatment. That is to say they comprise cases which are " non- failures " according to Pasteur's definition of the term. A person who dies more than 15 days after the completion of treatment was called a " failure " by Pasteur, as he considered that the treatment had not arrived at its full effectiveness, until this period had elapsed. The exact period of time fixed upon may be subject to criticism, but for obvious reasons some such limit must be set so as to exclude from the failures such cases as No. 12 (Table 18) of the present report, in which case the patient had only received one dose of vaccine before symptoms set in. The object of this selection then is to exclude, as far as is possible, the effects of treatment.
8 The figures are as follows:9 THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF DOGS TO SALIVA OF RABID ANIMALS. The second question is, what is the chance of infection occurring in a dog bitten by a rabid dog. The only information available on this point is to be found in a paper by Cruickshank and Wright (Indian Journal of Medical Research, Volume I, page 532). In experiments carried out with saliva of dogs actually suffering from rabies, they found that the intra-muscular introduction of the saliva brought about only one doubtful infection in 18 cases. It would seem then that dogs are relatively difficult to infect by saliva. THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS. We have then in these two observations an indication of what is essential for the maintenance of the disease amongst any group of animals. From the first it is obvious that for the disease to remain steady, the average dog or jackal, as the case may be, must infect one other dog or jackal. For this to occur we see from the second observation that a very considerable number of dogs must be bitten by the average rabid dog. If the population of dogs in a locality is so scattered that the average rabid dog cannot bite a number of other dogs sufficient to carry on the infection, then the disease will die out, and this would in itself be sufficient reason (other things being equal) why epidemics of rabies do not occur in animals of solitary habits. Two obvious measures for controlling the disease emerge from these considera- tions: (a) the reduction in the number of dogs, especially such as are free to roam at large, and (b) measures, which would make biting impossible. These with measures to exclude the possibility of the introduction of infection from outside the community must form the basis of any effective programme of control. But there are some points of detail to which attention may be directed. (1) It is of primary importance that the presence of the disease should be recognised as early as possible. The brain of every dog which has died of symptoms which arouse a suspicion of rabies should be sent in preservative (not glycerine) to a Pasteur Institute for examination, irrespective of whether it has bitten a human being or not.
10 (2) For any measure for the prevention of biting to be effective in controlling the disease, it must be directed against the biting of other dogs. (3) Measures which prevent the biting of human beings, though of great importance, have no effect in controlling the disease unless they pre- vent the biting of other dogs also. For example, tying up is ineffective if other dogs can approach and be bitten by the tied up dog. (4) The most effective of all means of preventing biting is efficient muzzling. (5) For every dog in a community which is known to have been bitten by a rabid dog there are probably many others which have been bitten, of whose identity we are ignorant. (6) This is the more probable if the rabid dog had been roaming at large. (7) Consequently for muzzling to be an efficient measure for the control of rabies in a community it must be generally applied in that com- munity. THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS. If one admits then that these facts concerning the prevalence of rabies, deduced from the statistics of the European population, can be taken as an indi- cation of what is occurring amongst the people as a whole, that is to say, if one accepts the premise that rabies is not on the increase in India, then one must accept the conclusion that the anti-rabic Institutes in this country have not as yet fully satisfied the necessities of the Indian people. The accompanying tables and charts show how great has been the increase of persons coining to this Institute since its inauguration. It might be argued that such an increase was due to reduction in the risk incurred by the average patient: that a larger number of persons were treated who ran no risk at all. But this is not borne out by the figures given in the following table:Number of Patients attending Pasteur Institute., Kasauli. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74948121.tif]
NUMBER OF PATIENTS [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74948133.tif]
11 access to that treatment. We are then, as an Institute, in a position to consider the future, its demands, and the measures necessary to meet them. It may be asked whether in any one area or province, we are nearing the limit of the necessity of the people. That is a difficult question to answer. In the case of the Punjab the rate of increase has fallen off during the last 3 years, and it may be that a limit will shortly be attained. But a similar falling off occurred during the years 190912 a way which is applicable to their own home and village life, then a useful lesson will have been taught. The present site of the patients' quarters is completely occupied, but a new site is available on which we can carry out our further extensions. If this is agreed to, every endeavour will be made to develop a new village on model lines, and we propose to reinforce this object-lesson, by weekly talks on elementary village sanitation. A. G.

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF INDIA. The Central Committee have pleasure in submitting their fifteenth Annual Report and the accounts of the Pasteur Institute of India for the period January 1, 1915, to June 30, 1916. This is the first time that a balance sheet has been prepared. The financial position of the Institute is shown in the Auditor's report and the statement of accounts that are attached. It is satisfactory to note that, in spite of ever-growing expenses, the subscriptions and contributions received were sufficient to meet the cost of maintenance. It must be noted, however, that several local Governments have, or are about to have, Pasteur Institutes of their own: this will lead to a cessation of the subscriptions which such local Governments have generously given to our Institute in the past. As was stated in our last year's report, a multiplication of anti-rabic institutes in India at the present time cannot be expected to lead to an actual decrease in the number of patients presenting themselves for treatment at the Kasauli Institute. The increasing dissemination of knowledge regarding the efficacy of Pasteurian treatment much more than counterbalances the diminution directly resulting from such multiplication of institutes. Once again we have to report a very appreciable increase in the number of persons treated: the number in 1915 was 5,046 as compared with 4,585 in the previous year. The number of patients treated each year since the inauguration of the Institute is shown in the following table:Of the 5,046 persons treated, 4,724 were Indians, an increase of 600 over the figure for the previous year. The accommodation for such a large number of Indians, mostly of the poorer classes, has been attended with much difficulty. Overcrowding has been considerable. A new two-storied line of quarters (24 in all) for such patients is approaching completion and will do much to relieve the present congestion. "Manor Lodge," the residence occupied by the Assistant Surgeon attached to the Institute, has had to be dismantled. The amount of money necessary to make the building safe was out of all proportion to its value. The site thus cleared has been utilized for the new patients' quarters referred to above. The new hospital on the "Sunny Bank" site has been completed and has proved of very great value. The President of the Central Committee inspected the Institute during the year: the Secretary visited the Institute on three occasions. Major McKendrick, I.M.S., was Director of the Institute throughout the year. Captain C. Fox, I.S.M.D., acted as Assistant Director. To both of these officers the thanks of the Central Committee are due for the very efficient manner in which the Institute has been managed. F. NORMAN WHITE, M.D., Major, I.M.S., Secretary. (b)

Treatment was afforded to 5,046 persons during 1915, as compared with 4,585 during the previous year2 If this action be insufficient or late, the patient will die, if it be suffi- cient and early, the patient will live. In this race then a patient who arrives late is handicapped. Obviously if the race be a short one the effect of the handicap will be more significant than if the race be a long one. Thus if, in a certain class of case, we know that the incubation period is long, we should expect the effect of the handicap to be slight: whereas in classes of cases in which the incubation period is short, the effect of the handicap should be more apparent. 2. In considering the effects of this handicap we shall only compare cases which arrive during the 1st and 2nd weeks, respectively. One reason for doing so is that the numbers of later arrivals are relatively small. But there is another and a more important reason. A person who has been bitten by a rabid animal may be likened to a person under- taking a journey in the course of which the accident of death may occur. During the first fortnight the risk of accident is zero: during the next it increases, and from the 5th to 8th week the risk is at its highest; thereafter it again declines gradually. A person who comes immediately for treatment, has to face the whole period of risk. If he arrives late, part of the dangerous period has already been safely traversed and only a fraction of the total risk remains. If one remembers, (a) that the effects of treatment are not considered to be completely established until 15 days after the close of treatment (or 4 weeks after the arrival of the patient at the Institute) and (b) that most deaths occur from the 5th to the 8th week, it will be seen that persons who arrive during the 3rd week after the bite will not have acquired their full immunity until a considerable portion of the most dangerous period has elapsed. Thus in the case of these persons a disturbing factor is introduced. The subjoined table is a summary of Table 9. Situation of bite. Leg. Face and Multiple face. Average incubation period in days . . . 61 29 Advantage of arrival lst week over arrival in 2nd week . . . 1.09 2.2
3 Cases are grouped according to their situation. In the first row of figures are given the average incubation periods in days of the deaths which occurred in the two groups. In the second row, indices are given, which are obtained by dividing the percentage mortality amongst those who arrived during the 2nd week, by the percentage mortality amongst those who arrived during the 1st week. The contention already explained is borne out. In the case of persons bitten on the leg whose average incubation period is two months, the advantage so far as the figures show is negligible4 This figure is of course quite distinct from the percentage mortality amongst persons coming for treatment. It is the lowest possible estimate of the percentage saving of life amongst those who would have died, had they received no treat- ment at all. A. G. McKENDRICK, Major,, I.M.S., Director. C.

SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF INDIA, KASAULI. THE Central Committee have pleasure in submitting their sixteenth annual report and the accounts of the Pasteur Institute of India for the year ending June 30, 1917. The financial position of the Association as set forth in the balance sheet is satisfactory. The Revenue account discloses a loss on the year's working of Rs. 3,153-13-6; this result, however, is arrived at after providing Rs. 7,403-13-0 for depreciation of the properties, plant, and effects. On the other hand, the year's results have benefited to the extent of probably some Rs. 3,000 by an undervaluation of the opening stocks of miscellaneous stores, drugs and chemicals. In compiling the Revenue account regard has been had in the case of the Government of India, and Provincial Government grants, to the date of payment, and the period covered by the grants; the accrued portion of unpaid grants, and the unexpired portion of paid grants, being carried forward as assets and liabilities, respectively, in the balance sheet. The result has been that a full year's grant has been credited to Revenue in each case, irrespective, of the amount actually received in cash during the period. During the year under audit the furniture and fittings of the Insti- tute, the laboratory apparatus and utensils, and other loose effects have been revalued by the staff, the necessary adjustment of book values occasioned thereby resulting in a direct addition to Capital account of a sum of Rs. 2,288-12-0. The revaluation has been carried out on a conservative basis and the increased prices due to the war have not been taken into account. With regard to depreciation of the fixed assets and loose effects, the percentages provided in the present balance sheet will be adhered to for the next few years during which experience will show whether they are suitable or not. It would, at present, appear that the provision made is adequate. With regard to the Library, it is proposed to carry this on the books at the fixed sum of Rs. 5,000, making no provision for depreciation,
but charging all future additions to Revenue. It is appreciated that while some works become obsolete in time, and therefore valueless, others on the other hand acquire an enhanced value, thus a fair valuation of this asset would, at all times, be difficult of ascertainment. In spite of the opening of other Pasteur Institutes in India, the attendance at the Kasauli Institute continued to increase. During 1691, 5,360 persons received treatment against 5,046 in the previous year. The annual attendance, since the Institute was opened in 1900, is set forth in the following table:( ii ) THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE Balance Sheet as at Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P. CAPITAL AND LIABILITIES.

By Expenses of MaintenanceREPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE YEAR 1916. DURING the year 5,360 persons have received treatment as compared with 5,046 during 1915. Of these 4,982 were Indians, and 378 were Europeans. A group consisting of 393 persons has been extracted from the statistics. In the case of these persons treatment was either considered unnecessary, or subsequent events proved that they ran no risk. Again there has been a considerable increase in the numbers coming for treat- ment, and again this increase has evidenced itself principally among Indians. Of those who received treatment, 70 contracted Rabies. These may be classified as follows:2 Our thanks are due to Sub-Assistant Surgeon Chunilal and the clerical and laboratory staffs for their conscientious work throughout the year, and in particular to Accountant Maharaj Kishan for much pains- taking work in consequence of the new system of accounts inaugurated by the auditors Messrs. Neison King & Simson, and to Cashier Prabhu Dayal for similar work in connection with the classification and valuation of equipment and stores. The Institute has benefited greatly by the help and experience of Mr. G. T. Sparke, lately Secretary of the Kasauli Club, who has volun- tarily taken charge of the rabbit-breeding establishment. His labours have been crowned with success, and we desire gratefully to acknowledge them. Our thanks are also due to the many patients who, during the period of their treatment, have given us the benefit of their professional experience, and skill. TABLE I.

20 TABLE XX. Punjab Provincial Laboratory Work. As the Provincial Laboratory of the Punjab, this Institute was called upon to examine and report on the following:STATISTICAL REPORT FOR THE QUIN- QUENNIAL PERIOD, 191222 It will be seen that some errors have crept in, but the resulting differences are of so low an order that a recount of all the cards has not been considered necessary. The method of treatment in use throughout the entire period was that of a 14 days' course of carbolized fixed virus, prepared as described by Sir David Semple in No. 44 of the Scientific Memoirs of the Govern- ment of India. With these preliminary remarks we may proceed to a discussion of the results emerging from the tables, and from such additional data as we have been able to extract. For convenience we have numbered each table for the quinquennial period with the Roman form of the same number as is employed for that table in the annual reports. The discussion of the data available may conveniently be taken under the following heads:23 Seasonal Prevalence.24 and cities are concerned, the area from which we draw rural patients is comparatively small. It is from this source that the annual increments in the number of patients are mainly being drawn, and we may conclude that a large increase in the number of patients is still to be expected from rural sources. We may add here that as the mortalities for dog and jackal bites during the quinquennium were respectively 1.11 per cent and 2.02 per cent, it is to be expected that with this increase amongst patients from rural areas there will be a corresponding increase of a small order in the general mortality. 2. THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS ON THE MORTALITY OF RABIES. It was with the object of determining the influence of such factors that Tables V, VI, VII and VIII were designed by Major Harvey. The factors which he set out to investigate were 25 This point may be examined in another way. If we calculate the mean number of bites amongst non-fatal and fatal cases respectively we find that the average for non-fatal cases is 3.90, whilst that for fatal cases is 6.54. Thus there is no doubt that the mortality increases, caeteris paribus, with the number of bites received. Depth of Bite.26 Position of Bite.27 be considered as having been completely established. That this method of classification has its advantages will appear when we come to discuss the effects of the treatment. In each case the date of commencement of symptoms and the date of death are recorded in the annual reports. The first of these figures is much less reliable than the second, and in a number of cases cannot be ascertained. We have therefore dealt with the interval between bite and death only in the following analysis. This figure could not be ascertained in two instances. We have for convenience called it the incubation period. The Incubation Period in relation to Position of Bite.28 own number and also to the quantity of antibodies present. The quantity of these antibodies again depends upon some function of the number of organisms and of the time during which they have acted, for antibodies are produced by a reaction of the host against the organisms invading it. Thus, during the course of an infection, the number of organisms will in most cases increase up to a maximum and subsequently decrease. If this maximum be above the 'limen' at which symptoms appear, we say that the patient has suffered from the disease, but if the maximum be below the 'limen,' symptoms will in ordinary circumstances never appear. It is thus wrong to consider the incubation period of an animal which has escaped the disease as infinite. If the number of organisms attain a maximum which is below the 'limen' and subsequently decreases, then the term incubation period has no meaning. Now there are two main ways in which the course of such a disease may be modified, and these depend upon the two factors which we have mentioned. In the first place the initial dose of the infecting organism may vary, thus influencing the initial number of parent organisms; and in the second place the number of antibodies, or the rate of their production, may vary. The first means of modification is obvious; the second requires some further discussion. In the case of an untreated disease variations in antibody formation will depend on what we may call the reactivity of the host. In the case of an infection occurring in an animal which has previously been immunized by doses of a dead specific vaccine it is generally accepted that the reactivity of the animal has been raised to a higher level, and that the rate of antibody formation depends on this increased reactivity of the tissues. Thus in both these cases we have simply to deal with what we have called reactivity. The case of the effects of post infectional immunization is much more complicated, and we shall leave its discussion until later. The problems which we have to investigate are then29 statistics at our disposal will be generally applicable; but an interesting line of investigation will have been opened up, for answers to these questions will give us a very deep insight into the nature of the processes which are operative during an infection. Is there a relation between incubation period and the dose of the infect- ing organism? Let us now examine the evidence. We have seen that we have no direct measure of the dose received, but that in number of bites, depth of bite, the effect of interposition of clothing, and the effect of cauterization we have indications of its degree. None of these indications is perfect in itself, but a study of their effects should afford sufficient evidence on which to base an answer to our question30 bare skin is 43.93, whereas that amongst those bitten through clothing is 79.2. In this case then we have what appears to be a direct relation between incubation period and dosage, but here again we are dealing with very small numbers, for the mean incubation period amongst those bitten through clothing is calculated from a total of only 15 cases. (4) The effect of cauterization is to increase the mean incubation period from 47.24 days to 53.46 days whereas the mortality is reduced in the proportion of 4 to 3. (5) We may also add in this connection that the mean incubation periods amongst persons bitten by dogs and jackals were 49.9 and 48.4 days respectively, whilst their mortalities were 1.11 and 2.02 per cent. We recognize, however, that this result may not be dependent on dosage per se, but may be influenced by variations in position, etc. We may now classify such answers to question 1 as have been obtained from our results, as follows:31 The results were as follows:32 It will be seen that both in the total and in the divided figures there is a definite tendency towards lengthening of the incubation periods among those who have arrived early and who have consequently been afforded the full benefits of treatment. The cases of pre-infectional and post-infectional immunization are not, as we have said, analogous, and consequently the results which we have obtained are not necessarily contradictory, but all the same they are of such a nature as to make one hesitate regarding their interpretation, and the second question must remain unanswered. Summary. Whilst then we are unable to state definitely whether there is a relation between the period of incubation and reactivity, the balance of the evidence which we have put forward is in favour of the conclusion that the period of incubation is independent of the degree of the infecting dose. If we accept this conclusion tentatively a problem of great interest discloses itself, for we naturally are led to consider in what circum- stances such an independence is possible. The problem is analogous to that of tautochronous motion, which engages the attention of the physi- cist. A motion is defined as tautochronous when the period after which the body in question arrives at some point is independent of the initial position of the body. The problem as it presents itself to us is one in which the period after which the number of organisms attains a particular value (the limen) is independent of the initial number of organisms. We note also that on the assumptions stated on page 28 the occurrence of a considerable proportion of 'escapes' will indicate that the limen is not far distant from the maximum. A full discussion of the question would be out of place in this report, but we may state that we have found that the conditions are fulfilled when the effect, as evidenced by antibody production, depends upon the logarithm of the stimulus, i.e., upon the logarithm of the number of organisms present. That this is analogous with the laws of psychology is at once apparent, and that such an analogy should exist is not to be wondered at, for in this, as in the case of psychological processes, we are dealing with reactivities and with perceptions in the shape of symptoms, which may or may not be subliminal. To generalize as to the nature of the laws which control antibody formation on the basis of such slender evidence gained from the study of one particular and rather peculiar disease would be unwarranted,
33 but it is interesting to note that the assumption of a logarithmic relation (Weber's law) is also sufficient to explain how a septicæmia may relapse of itself, that is to say, without the action of some additional external stimulus. Thus, light would be thrown upon the relapsing condition of such a disease as Malta fever and possibly of typhoid. THE EFFECT OF THE TREATMENT As we have no reliable information regarding the mortality amongst the untreated with which to compare our results, it has been necessary to approach this problem from a comparative point of view. Amongst the deaths recorded in the adjoining tables, as we have said, are included all fatal accidents due to rabies. No cases have been excluded on the basis that full treatment has not been received, or on the basis that sufficient time has not elapsed for the development of full immunity. We have thus, in these statistics, a graded series of persons who have received varied degrees of benefit from the treatment. At the one extreme we have the man who arrived late, received one dose, and whose symptoms appeared within two hours; we pass to those who arrived late and died during the course of treatment, and so on, with, at the other extreme, those who arrived early, received their full course, and died at some subsequent period. It would appear then that a classification on the basis of time of arrival would in some degree indicate the degree of benefit received, and it is on this basis that we will examine the figures. It must, however, always be remembered that a person arriving late has already traversed an aliquot portion of his period of risk, so that the figures for the later weeks will be much disturbed. With these preliminary remarks we may proceed to examine the figures. Effects of treatment upon the mortality rate. In Table IX, cases are classified according to the number of days which elapsed after the bite, before treatment was commenced, and according to the part of the body on which they were bitten. Percentage mortalities are given in part C. It will be seen that among the total cases there is no appreciable benefit in early arrival. But when one examines the columns of arm and face bites in particular, the advantage of early arrival is apparent. In the case of bites on the leg there is little difference, and as these are by far the most frequent, they swamp the effect in the total. The reason for these differences is not far to seek. The process of immunization may be described as a race between the virus and the vaccine. The virus travels towards the 3
34 central nervous system and, after a period of time, if it be not counteracted, will arrive at the central nervous system, and be in a position to induce the symptoms of rabies. The vaccine, introduced into the body during a 14 days' course of treatment, is in some manner combating the virus or preparing the central nervous system for its arrival. If this action be insufficient or late, the patient will die; if it be sufficient and early, the patient will live. In this race, then, the patient who arrives late is handi- capped. Obviously if the race be a short one the effect of the handicap will be more significant than if the race be a long one. Thus if, in a certain class of case, we know that the incubation period is long, we should expect the effect of the handicap to be slight; whereas in classes of cases in which the incubation period is short, the effect of the handicap should be more apparent. It was with the object of testing the truth of these assumptions that this table was drawn up, with the result that the apparent unsatisfactoriness of the total figures was explained. In the case of leg bites whose mean incubation is 60 days, the effect of the handicap is not evident, whereas in the case of arm and face bites with mean incubation of 52 and 39 days, respectively, it is well marked. ARRIVAL DURING MORTALITIES AMONGST PERSONS BITTEN ON35 observations have been tabulated on page 31. One may repeat that, both in the total figures and in those of cases divided according to the position on which the bite was inflicted, there is evidence of a definite tendency towards lengthening of the incubation periods amongst those who have arrived early, and who have consequently been afforded the full benefits of treatment. Summary. As we have stated above, proof of the beneficial effects of treatment from the figures at our disposal can only be arrived at by comparative methods, and consequently the results obtained can only be of a comparative nature:36 reached his limen might be coaxed over his maximum. Clearly the most hopeful cases would be those of the untreated, in which the incubation period was naturally a long one, or those in which anti-rabic treat- ment had succeeded to the extent of lengthening the incubation period, but not to the extent of warding off the onset of symptom. As such cases do not occur in Kasauli, the point cannot be tested here and we must ask for the co-operation of the medical profession. We have found that 1/100th grain of the sulphate injected subcutaneously, every four hours is usually sufficient to obliterate spasm. This may be taken as a guide but, clearly, each case would require careful watching. A. G. McKENDRICK, Major, I.M.S., Director. C. FOX, Captain, I.S.M.D., Assistant Director.

( i ) SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COM- MITTEE OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF INDIA, KASAULI. The Central Committee have pleasure in submitting their seven- teenth annual report and the accounts of the Association for the year ending June 30th, 1918. The year's working has resulted in a profit of Rs. 1,016 as against a loss of Rs. 3,153 in 1916-17. Depreciation of the buildings, plant, furni- ture, &c., has been provided for at the same rates as in the previous year. During 1917 the cost of treatment per head worked out at nine rupees to which it has fallen from Rs. 18-8 in 1910. It is unlikely that this figure can be decreased still further. There was a slight decrease in the number of patients seeking treat- ment at the Institute during the year under report. The following table Which details the annual attendance at the Institute since it was opened in 1900 is remarkable testimony to the valuable work now being carried on:(ii) THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE Balance Sheet as CAPITAL AND LIABILITIES.

The number of patients during the year 1917 was 5,2062 ending 1916, there is little of scientific value or novelty to be added from this year's experience. An examination of the relative proportions of persons bitten by dog and jackal respectively, in areas of a definitely rural character, was made, with reference to the conjecture arrived at in that discussion. It may be remembered that the figures showed that the proportion of jackal to dog bites was on the increase. From 19013 TABLE I.

( i ) EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMIT- TEE OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF INDIA, KASAULI. The Central Committee have pleasure in submitting their eighteenth annual report and the accounts of the Association for the year ending June 30th, 1919. The year's working has resulted in a profit of Rs. 3,843 as against Rs. 1,016 in 1917-18. Depreciation of the buildings, plant, furniture, etc., has been provided for at the same rates as in the previous year. There was an increase of 474 in the number of patients seeking treat- ment at the Institute during the year under report. The following table which details the annual attendance at the Institute since it was opened in 1900, is remarkable testimony to the valuable work now being carried on:( ii ) THE PASTEUR INSTI Balance Sheet as CAPITAL AND LIABILITIES.

During the year under review 5,680 persons received a full course of treatment, of these 5,151 were Indians and 529 were Europeans. Thus in comparison with the corresponding figures for the previous year there has been a total increase of 474, of which the contribution from the Indian element was 327, and from the European 147. The increase applies more or less generally to all areas from which patients are drawn, with the exception of Bengal. In this province the effect of the opening of the new Institute at Shillong has shown itself in progressive reductions from 572 in 1916, to 258 in 1917 and to 90 in 1918. In the series of figures in table X, giving admissions month by month, the effect of the epidemic of Influenza which struck India during the 3rd week of October, is well marked. Had the level of the first nine months of the year been maintained throughout the year the total of patients treated would have been 6,031 in place of 5,680. In the case of 414 persons, chiefly Europeans, treatment was not considered necessary, or was discontinued on receipt of information that the biting animal had not succumbed from rabies. Of those who received treatment, 69 (including 2 Europeans) con- tracted the disease. Of these:2 In the report for the year 1916 we published statistics gathered from 20,511 Indians who attended for treatment during the quinquennial period 1912 to 1916. These may be regarded as normals and the percentage figures during the present year compared with them. Percentage mortalities. 1918. Normal. Depar- ture. All cases 1.30 1.375 3 will appear from a comparison with figures for former years as shown in the following table:4 year under review one hesitates to draw any conclusion. One can only meditáte upon the danger of drawing conclusions regarding rabies from statistics relating even to 5,000 individuals. It may not be out of place in this report to indicate the part which this Institute has played, in connection with the War which came to an end during the year under review. Although a Civil institution, it has acted throughout as the base for anti-rabic treatment, to the troops in Mesopotamia, and other Asian theatres, and has also afforded treat- ment to the majority of cases occurring amongst the Indian garrison. The numbers of all ranks treated during the last four years of the war are detailed below:5 TABLE I.
