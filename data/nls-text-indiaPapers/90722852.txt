Bikaner.VACCINATION IN RAJPUTANA. 5 31. The vaccination returns from the Native States show an increase in primary vaccination, viz., 258,958 against 255,325, this is mainly due to the figures of the Tonk State and the Kushalgarh Estate being received this year. Re-vaccination rose from 1,199 in 1911-12 to 1,373 in 1912-13 owing to the prevalance of small-pox in some of the Native States. 32. The average number of vaccinators was 159 against 158 in 1911-12 Bikaner and Bundi having each reduced their establishment by one and two vaccinators already employed in Tonk State and one in Kushalgarh Estate having been shown in the Annual Vaccination Statements for the year under report. The cost of each successful case was 24 pies as compared with 23 pies in 1911-12. No vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season. Vaccinations were performed entirely by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon attached to the Agency Hospital; consequently no expenditure was incurred on the establishment. A sum of R3-7-0 shown in column &quot; contin- gencies &quot; is the cost of the lymph. 33. Of the work performed in Marwar State 480 primary vaccinations were done by the Sub-Assistant Surgeons in Dispensary towns with a successful percentage of 97.71 : and the Sub-Assistant Surgeons in the Sirohi State performed 153 vaccinations. 34. 23.87 per thousand of the population in the Native States were successfully vaccinated, against 23.56 per thousand of population in 1911-12. STATEMENT No. II. 35. The total expenditure on vaccination in Native States was R32,102-12-2 as compared with R30,107-5-5 in 1911-12, the increase in cost being due chiefly to increased travelling allowances to vaccinators in Jaipur and Bikaner States. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 11 pies in Sirohi to 180 pies in Jaisalmer. In the latter there is only a scanty population scattered over a large area. 36. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspected and successful vaccination seen by Residency or Agency Surgeons in Native States:6 VACCINATION AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 39. The Residency Surgeon, Jaipur writes that Calf Vaccine Lymph was manufactured at the Mayo Hospital Bacteriological Laboratory, Jaipur and the result was good as 235 vaccinations were done with vaccine paste prepared from buffalo calf out of which 206 were successful. With a small extra cost it would be supplied all over the district to do away with arm to arm vaccination. SECTION II.DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 7 by Her Excellency Lady Hardinge in her address.
