Period covered by the report. 1. This report deals with the triennial period 1899-1900 to 1901- 1902, but as reports have been submitted for the two previous years, the present report deals more especially with the work of the latter year. Officers in charge of the De- partment. 2. During the period under review the office of Sanitary Commis- sioner and Superintendent-General of Vac- cination was held by Lieutenant-Colonel S. J. Thomson, C. I. E., I. M. S., up to 14th April 1899 ; by Major W. G. Thorold, I. M. S., from 15th April 1899 to 3rd April 1900 ; by Major G. M. J. Giles from 4th April 1900 to 18th September 1900 ; by Lieutenant-Colonel S. J. Thomson, C. I.E., I. M. S., from 19th September 1900 to 31st January 1902; and by myself from 1st February 1902 to the end of the year 1901- 1902. Area under vaccination. 3. No change has taken place in the area under vaccination during the triennial period. Returns from the Native State of Rámpur are, as usual, not received and the statistical statements are exclusive of that State. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. (Statement II.) 4. There has been no change in the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Assistant Superin- tendents of Vaccination during the triennial period. The number of vaccinators was :( 2 ) Average cost of each success- ful case. (Statement II.) 6. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination during each of the three years covered by this report was Re. 0-1-3 (one anna three pies), excluding pay and expenses of Deputy Sa- nitary Commissioners and their offices, and Re. 0-1-6 (one anna six pies) including the same. General operations, (Statement I.) 7. The number of persons vaccinated in each of the three years has increased from( 3 ) Districts showing highest and lowest number of persons suc- cessfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, with number of deaths from small-pox. (Statement I.) 10. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in 1901-1902 was highest (96.14) in Garhwál, which, as a result of the protec- tion afforded, shows the lowest average annual ratio of deaths (.01) from small-pox during the previous five years. Garhwál was followed by Almora with 56.71, Hardoi with 46.84, Hamírpur with 41.31, Naini Tál with 39.40, Pilibhít with 38.30, Sítapur with 37.41, Jalaun with 35.94. The number of deaths from small-pox in these districts was 4, 1, 14, 1, 2, 1, 2, and 82 respectively. In Hardoi (.01) and Jalaun (.20) alone of the above districts were the deaths from small-pox sufficient to give an annual death-rate per thousand of population. In the other dis- tricts the number was too low to give any appreciable rate per 1,000 of population. The districts showing the lowest number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population were Allahabad with 22.10, Farrukhabad with 23.35, Bara Banki with 25.19, Gonda with 26.14, Ballia with 26.21, Basti with 26.72, Azamgarh with 27.52, and Benares with 27.59. The number of deaths and death-rate from small-pox in these districts were respectively 57 and .04, nil and nil, 10 and nil, 36 and .02, 42 and .04, 4 and nil, 11 and nil, and 13 and .01. Five years' averages. (Statement I.) 11. Taking the previous five-year figures, the best protected district was Garhwál with an average of 71.77 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. The previous five-year average death-rate from small-pox in this district was .01, the lowest in the Provinces. Garhwál was followed by Almora with 58.10 (persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popu- lation), and .09 (death-rate from small-pox), Sitapur with 44.70 and .57, Hardoi with 41.26 and 1.02, Dehra Dún with 38.33 and .07, Etah with 38.03 and .88, Bulandshahr with 37.11 and .10, Naini Tál with 35.60 and .07. The average death-rates of Hardoi and Etah were above the pro- vincial average of .58. Garhwál, and indeed all the hill districts are splendidly protected, the people being most anxious to be vaccinated three or four times. Worst protected districts. (Statement I.) 12. The worst protected districts in the 5-year period were Allah- abad with 18.58 persons successfully vacci- nated per 1,000 of population, and 1.06 average annual death-rate from small-pox, followed by Bara Banki with 20.39 and .36 average annual death-rate from small-pox, Azamgarh with 20.54 and .50 average annual death-rate from small-pox, Farrukhabad with 20.95 and .30 average annual death-rate from small-pox, Jaunpur with 23.41 and 1.30 average annual death-rate from small-pox, Sultánpur with 23.73 and 1.45 average annual death-rate from small-pox, Bánda with 23.94 and .47 average annual death-rate from small-pox, and Gorakh- pur with 24.32 and .32 average annual death-rate from small-pox. In taking a series of well protected and a series of badly protected districts, the incidence of small-pox and a higher death-rate from the same is always, as might be expected, most marked in the latter. In a period of five years I find there were 2,551 deaths from small-pox in the eight best protected districts, while there were 7,667 in the eight worst protected districts in the same period. Vaccination in proportion to births in 1901-02. 13. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births was 44.11 for infants under one year, and 24.51 for children over one and under six years of age, compared with 37.62 and 19.30 in 1899-1900 and 43.76 and 26.80 in 1900-1901. The per- centages for infants (under one year) for the First Circle during the three years were 48.00, 54.96 and 53.97 compared with percentages for the Second Circle of 27.64, 33.10 and 34.13 respectively, which shows that there is much room for improvement in the Second Circle. The First
( 4 ) Circle has always shown better returns than the Second, but it is gratify- ing to see a general improvement all round in infantile vaccination. Supply of lymph, &c. 14. As usual, lymph was supplied from the hills to the districts in the plains in September and it was established in almost all districts by Octo- ber. Lymph was also supplied to numerous military officers and Native States on application. The mode of insertion in these Provinces is by cross scratching with a four pointed needle( 5 ) 18. The number of inspections by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and District Superintendents of Vaccination was 134,614 in 1899-1900, 158,239 in 1900- 1901, and 145,515 in 1901-1902. The de- creases in inspections this year have chiefly occurred in the districts of Mirzapur, Bijnor, Rae Bareli, Fatehpur( 6 ) Conclusion. 22. In conclusion I may say that the progress of vaccination in the United Provinces has, in the triennial period, not been inconsiderable, in spite of having to contend with such a formidable adversary as plague. In the nature of things vaccination must always be carried out among the most uneducated classes, and among people suspicious to a degree. The work of vaccination has been slowly built up, step by step, year by year, and it says much for the confidence placed in officials, that even during a period when plague has attacked the Provinces, no great falling off or opposition to vaccination has been observed and that even a gratifying increase in work can be shown.

I am to observe, however, that the very low figure (14.66 per cent.) in this column under Assistant Superintendents against Mirzapur is not sufficiently explained by the reason which you give, viz., the sparsely populated character of the district. Doubtless the Assistant Superintendent can do a less number of inspections in a day's journey, but the vaccinations will be less also. 4. I am to request that you will convey the acknowledgments of Government to the gentlemen who gave assistance in the cause of vaccination, and whose names are mentioned in your letter No. 2303, dated 9th August 1902.

Table of contents. ... ib. 1 &2 Against &quot; Vaccination in pro- portion to births.&quot; Notes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1902-1903. Constitution and strength of the Department. (Statement II.) THERE has been no change in the constitution of the Vaccination Department during the year 1902-1903. The number of vaccinators was 920 as opposed to 919 in the previous year. Expenditure on vaccination (Statement II.) 2. The total expenditure on vaccination during the year under report amounted to Rs. 1,36,196, as compared with Rs. 1,42,447 in 1901-1902, showing a decrease of Rs. 6,251. This has chiefly occurred under the head &quot; Pay of Establishment&quot; and is due to the fact that the charge of both circles was held by one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner for about nine months in the year. Average of cost of each suc- cessful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Rs. 0-1-2 (one anna two pies) excluding pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, and Rs. 0-1-4 (one anna four pies) including the same. This is the lowest cost on record. General operations. (Statement I.) 4. Including dispensary vaccination for the purposes of comparison, there has been an increase of 85,058 in the number of persons vaccinated, of 73,266 in the number of success- ful primary vaccinations, of 82 in the average num- ber of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator, of 1.80 in the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, and of 13,384 in the number of successful revaccinations, as compared with the previous year. The percentage of successful primary cases in which the results were known has also risen from 97.71 in 1901-1902 to 97.90 in 1902-1903. There has thus been an improvement under all heads, and that in spite of the fact that plague was much more widespread during the year under report than in the preceding year. It is satisfactory to note that a marked improvement has taken place in the work of the 2nd Circle this year. Thirty-seven districts show an increase in the number of successful primary vaccinations, as compared with 31 in the previous year. The most conspicuous are Sítapur with 25,566, Ballia with 16,028, Jhánsi with 4,682, Rae Bareli with 4,306, Hardoiwith 3,742, Gorakhpur with 3,554, and Hamírpur with 3,549. Out of 12 districts (including the Native State of Tehri-Garhwál) showing decreases, Cawnpore stands first with a decrease of 6,409 operations. Then in order come Allahabad with 2,226, Unao with 1,877, Fyzabad with 1,794, Mirzapur with 1,704, and Partábgarh with 1,698. The decrease in Cawnpore, Unao, and Partáb- garh is said to be due to the prevalence of plague. In Allahabad the decrease is said to be partly due to the prevalence of plague and partly to the unsatisfactory work of some of the vaccinators, who have been punished. In Fyzabad the decrease is said to be due to (1) the sickness and want of energy on the part of two of the older vaccinators in the beginning of the season, and (2) the outbreak of plague in Fyzabad. In Mirzapur the decrease is stated to be due to (1) inefficient supervision by the Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination, who has since been removed from his post, and (2) the fact that some of the vaccinators were new and inexperienced. Vaccination in proportion to births. 5. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births was 42.95 for infants under one year, and 22.07 for children over one and under six years of age. The percentage for all age periods was 68.52. The percentage for infants under one year for the 1st Circle was 52.08 as compared with 33.81 for the 2nd Circle. These figures do not include statistics of Tehri- Garhwal.
( 2 ) There has always been a strong objection in Oudh to submitting very young children to vaccination, and in this connection it should be noted that the birth- rate last year and this year was high. Dispensary vaccination. (State- ment III.) 6. Dispensary vaccination has this year been included, under the orders of Government, in Statements Nos. I, IV, V, and Appendices A and B. Nearly all the vaccination work in the Provinces is carried out by the Vaccination Department, and only 470 primary vaccinations were performed by medical subordinates. Of these operations, 328 were successful. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 7. The results of inspections of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations have been separately shown this year under the orders of the Government of India. The District Superintendents of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners inspected 161,335 primary operations and 4,334 re-vaccinations or 10.33 and 4.20 per cent., respectively. The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 505,675 cases( 3 ) Diagram. 12. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccina- tion in each district is attached. Conduct of officials. 13. The conduct of the officials was on the whole satisfactory, but vaccinators found falsifying their registers or slack in the perform- ance of their work were suitably punished. S. J.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1903-1904. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. (Statement II.) THERE has been no change in the constitution of the Vaccination Department during the year 1903-1904. The number of vaccinators was 917 against 920 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Vaccination. (Statement II.) 2. The total expenditure on vaccination during the year 1903-1904 was Rs 1,43,817 as compared with Rs. 1,36,196 in the pre- vious year,( 2 ) Dispensary vaccination. (State- ment III). 6. The form of statement No. III has also been revised this year under the orders of the Government of India referred to above. As remarked last year, nearly all vaccination work in the Provinces is carried out by the Vaccination Department, and only 540 operations( 3 ) The number of children under one year of age available for vaccination in the municipalities of these Provinces and the number of successful operations per- formed on them, are shown in Appendix B. It will be seen that in some muni- cipalities the numbers of children successfully vaccinated during the year were in excess of the numbers available. As explained in the previous report, this is due to the fact that children born outside the municipal area were brought into it to be vaccinated. It is also probably to some extent due to a faulty estimate of the ages of the children by the vaccinators. Diagram. 12. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccina- tion in each district is attached. Conduct of officials. 13. The conduct of the officials was on the whole satisfactory, but vaccinators found falsifying their registers or slack in the per- formance of their duties were suitably punished.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES OF AGRA AND OUDH FOR THE YEARS 1902-1903, 1903-1904, AND 1904-1905. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: Printed at the United Provinces Government Press. 1905.
[Prescribed maximum lengthTriennial Report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1902-03, 1903-04, and 1904-05. Period covered by the report. 1. THIS report covers the triennial period 1902-03 to 1904-05, but it deals more especially with the last year as separate reports have been submitted for the preceding two years. Officers in charge of the De- partment. 2. During the triennium under review the office of Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent-General of Vaccination was held by me from 1st April 1902 to 24th January 1903, and again from 1st February 1905 to 31st March 1905, and by Lieutenant-Colonel S. J. Thomson, C.I.E., I.M.S., from 25th January 1903 to 31st January 1905, when he proceeded on leave to Europe. Area under vaccination. 3. No change has taken place in the area under vaccination during the period under report. Constitution and strength of the Department. (Statement II.) 4. There has been no change in the number of Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners and assistant superintendents of vaccination during the period under review. The number of vaccinators employed during 1904-05 was 922 as compared with 917 in 1903-04 and 920 in 1902-03, the average number for the last three years being 920 against 925 in the preceding triennium. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 5. The total expenditure on vaccination during 1904-05 amounted to Rs. 1,48,638 against Rs. 1,43,817 in 1903-04 and Rs. 1,36,196 in 1902-03, the average annual expenditure during these three years being Rs. 1,42,884 against Rs. 1,39,616 in the preceding three years. The increase in expenditure in 1904-05 as compared with the preceding two years is chiefly due to the establish- ment of the central bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tál district). Out of the total cost of Rs. 1,48,638 a sum of Rs. 1,34,201 was spent on establish- ment, Rs. 3,661 on travelling allowance and Rs. 10,776 on contingencies. As regards the sources of payment, a sum of Rs. 14,472 was paid from Local Funds, Rs. 22,650 by municipalities, and Rs. 9,234 by native states, the provincial funds contributing the largest amount, Rs. 1,02,282, which includes Rs. 3,300 on account of the bovine lymph depôt referred to above. Average cost of each success- ful case. (Statement II.) 6. Excluding the pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, the average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Re. 0-1-3 (one anna and three pies) during 1904-05 against Re. 0-1-2 in 1903-04 and 1902-03. But including the pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners and their offices, the cost of each case was Re. 0-1-6 against Re. 0-1-5 in 1903-04 and Re. 0-1-4 in 1902-03. The increase under this head is accounted for by the explanation given in the foregoing paragraph. General operations. (State- ment I.) 7. The total number of persons vaccinated during the year 1904-05 was 1,671,760 against 1,667,104 in 1903-04 and 1,665,253 in 1902-03, the average annual number of persons vaccinated during the triennium under report being 1,668,039 against 1,546,821 in the preceding triennial period. The number of suc- cessful primary vaccinations has also increased from 1,504,925 in 1902-03 and 1,506,781 in 1903-04 to 1,517,491 in 1904-05, which shows an increase of 105,737 in the average annual number of successful primary vaccinations during the past three-year period as compared with the preceding one. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator during 1904-05 was 1,835 against 1,837 in 1903-04 and 1839 in 1902-03. Taking the triennial period under report as a whole, there is an increase of 121 in the average annual number of operations performed by each vaccinator as compared with the preceding three years( 2 ) as compared with the preceding one( 3 ) Vaccination in proportion to births. 12. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births in 1904-05 was 44.83 for infants under one year, 20.49 for children over one and under six years of age, and 67.91 for all age-periods against 43.79, 21.14 and 68.12, respectively, in 1903-04 and 42.95, 22.07 and 68.52 in 1902-03. The percentages for infants under one year for the First Circle during 1904-05 and the preceding two years were 52.50, 53.29 and 52.08 as compared with 37.17, 34.61 and 33.81 for the Second Circle. As stated in a previous report there has always been a strong objection in Oudh to submitting very young children to vaccination, but there has been a satisfactory increase under this head in the Second Circle this year although there is still much room for improvement. The statistics of Tehri-Garhwál are not included in the above figures. Dispensary vaccination (Statement III). 13. The number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during 1904-05 was 418( 4 ) The Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 502,633 cases in 1904-05( 5 ) Buffalo calf lymph was used only for vaccinating calves and for preserving the strain in the hot weatherDiagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox, and the proportion of population protected by vaccination, in each district of the United Provinces. The black lines and figures indicate proportion of population protected by vaccination during the year 1904-1905 and the six years preceding it. The red lines and figures indicate the death-rate from small-pox during 1904.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 222/XVI-231B/13 OF 1905. FROM S. H. BUTLER, ESQ., C.I.E., SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCES, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, UNITED PROVINCES. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 9TH AUGUST 1905. SIR, ANITATION DEPT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your triennial report on vaccination for the years 1902-3 to 1904-5. The report, which was due on the 1st July, was not received until the 1st August. 2. There is nothing in the report which calls for comment or criticism. The results of the triennium show slow but steady progress. Where work is backward the necessary orders have been issued. It is hoped that the opening of the depôt at Patwa Dangar will lead to material improvement in this province and in the native states which draw their supplies from it. 3. I am to request that you will convey the thanks of Govern- ment to the gentlemen, named in your letter no. 3042, dated 2nd August 1905, who gave assistance in the cause of vaccination. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, S. H. BUTLER, Secretary.

[Prescribed maximum leanaghtNOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1905-06. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. (Statement II.) THREE has been no change in the constitution of the Vaccination Depart ment during the year 1905-06. The number of vaccinators was 933 against 922 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Vaccination. (Statement II.) 2. The expenditure on vaccination during the year 1905-06 amounted to Rs. 1,53,241 against Rs. 1,48,638 in the preceding year, although one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner held charge of both circles for about eight months The increase in expenditure is chiefly due to the purchase from England of bacteriological instruments and apparatus for the central bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal). Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination. (State- ment II.) 3. Excluding the pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, the average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Re. 0-1-3 (one anna and three pies), but including these charges the cost of each case was Re. 0-1-6 (one anna and six pies), i.e., exactly the same as in the preceding year. General operations. (State- ment I.) 4. The total number of operations during the year under report was 1,695,416 against 1,671,760 in 1904-1905( 2 ) Vaccination in proportion to births. 5. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births in 1905-06 was 48.25 for infants under one year, 26.81 for children over one and under six years of age, and 78.13 for all age-periods, against 44.83, 20.49 and 67.91 respectively in the preceding year. The percentage for infants under one year for the First Circle was 57.35 as compared with 39.09 for the Second Circle. The reasons for this discrepancy have been given in previous reports. The statistics of Tehri-Garhwal are not included in these figures. Dispensary Vaccination. (Statement III.) 6. The number of operations performed by medical subordinates at dispen- saries during the year under report was 655( 3 ) Bovine lymph depôts. 11. Bovine lymph depôts were maintained at Lucknow and Patwa Dangar (Naini Tál). The total number of primary opera. tions performed with pure calf lymph was 18,788 against 21,876 in 1904-05, the percentages of success being 99.10 and 98.85 respectively. The numbers of primary and secondary vaccinations performed with glycerinated lymph were 32,123 and 4,037 respectively, the percentages of success being 91.54 and 55.66. In 305 primary operations and 258 re-vaccinations performed with lanoline lymph during 1905-06, the percentages of success were 96.72 and 78.33, respectively. The depôt at Patwa Dangar being now well equipped, has largely increased in utility. During the past year the work developed to such an extent that two extra vaccinators of the Naini Tál district and the tube-fillers of Dehra Dún and Almora districts had to be called in to assist. Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting a good and regular supply of calves at a reasonable price. In all, during 1905-06, 115 calveseach district of the United Provinces.

ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 238/XVI-231B-14 OF 1906. FROM E. F. L. WINTER, ESQ., SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, UNITED PROVINCE, TO THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, UNITED PROVINCES. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 17TH AUGUST 1906. SIR, SANITATION DEPT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your notes on vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1905-6. The notes, which should have reached Government on the 1st July, were not received till the 4th August. 2. The increase in the number of vaccinations, notwithstanding that many vaccinators were employed on special cholera duty, is satis- factory, as is also the success obtained at the bovine lymph dépôt at Patwa Dangar. 3. I am to request that you will convey the thanks of Govern- ment to the gentlemen, named in your letter no. 3866, dated the 13th August 1906, who gave assistance in the cause of vaccination. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, E. F. L. WINTER, Secretary.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES OF AGRA AND OUDH FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD : Printed at the United Provinces Government Press, 1907.
[Prescribed maximum lengthNOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1906-07. Constitution of the Vaccina- tion Department. THERE has been no change in the constitution of the Vaccination Depart- ment during the year 1906-07 except that the appoint- ments of vaccinators made after the 27th November 1906 have been declared non-pensionable under the orders contained in G. G. O. (Home Department) No. 190-202, dated the 27th November 1906. The appointments of tube-fillers attached to the districts of Almora, Garhwal and Dehra Dun were also abolished with effect from 17th October 1906 in consequence of the reorganization of the staff attached to the central bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal). Strength of the Vaccination Department. (Statement II.) 2. During the year under report an additional Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination has been posted to Gorakhpur, which is a very large district. The number of these officials is now 50 (including one for the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal), as compared with 49 in the preced- ing year. The number of vaccinators was 934 as compared with 933 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. The total expenditure on vaccination during the year under report was Rs. 1,50,971 against Rs. 1,53,241 in the preceding year. The decrease is chiefly due to the lessened expenditure connected with the bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal) for which fewer costly articles were purchased from England during the period under report than in the preceding year. Average cost of each success- full case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 4. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Re. 0-1-3 (one anna and three pies) during 1906-07 when the pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices are not taken into account, but including these charges the cost of each successful case comes to Re. 0-1-6 (one anna and six pies). In both cases the cost was exactly the same as in the preceding year. The fact that the cost of a successful case remained the same although the total expenditure on vaccination was less than in the preceding year is explained by the falling off in the number of operations performed during the period under report. General operations. (Statement I.) 5. The total number of persons vaccinated during 1906-07 was 1,675,060 against 1,695,416 in the preceding year( 2 ) also Chief Plague Officer and the amount of time at his disposal for vaccination work is very small and his inspections were very few. I am of opinion that it is very necessary to have a whole time Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in charge of each Circle, as was the case in former years. Twenty-two districts show an increase in the number of successful primary operations against 34 in the preceding year. Garhwal stands first with an increase of 3,804. Ghazipur follows with 3,240. Then in order come Rae Bareli with 2,958, Benares with 2,791, Allahabad with 2,121, Cawnpore with 1,838, Azamgarh with 1,806, Partabgarh with 1,753 and Kheri with 1,752. Jalaun, with a decrease of 7,922, heads the list of districts which show a falling off. Etawah comes next with 6,251. Then in order come Hamirpur with 5,997, Agra with 5,643, Saharanpur with 4,962 and Farrukhabad with 3,143. In Jalaun the decrease is stated to be due to a certain extent to the weak condition of children in consequence of the famine which preceded the vaccination season. It was also due to the unusual prevalence of mala- rial fever in the first three months of the season. Another reason adduced by the District Superintendent of Vaccination of Jalaun is that much work has been done in that thinly populated district in former years, and that it cannot go on at the same rate. In Etawah, Hamirpur and Agra the decrease is attributed to the high death-rate and low birth-rate which followed scarcity. In Agra it was also due to the illness of some vaccinators, and to the fact that a large number of operations were performed in 1905-06 in schools, &c., on account of the prevalence of small-pox. In Saharanpur the decrease is attributed to the prevalence of plague and malarial fever. In Farrukhabad it is stated to be due to the prevalence of plague, and to a slight extent to slackness on the part of some vaccinators. Vaccination in proportion to births. 6. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births in 1906-07 was 48.42 for children under one year, 26.76 for those over one and under six years and 78.66 for all age-periods, against 48.25, 26.81 and 78.13 respectively in the preceding year. The percentage for children under one year for the 1st Circle was 55.97, against 40.59 for the 2nd Circle. The reasons for this discrepancy have been explained in previous reports, but it is satisfactory to note that improvement has continued under this head in the 2nd Circle during the year under report. The statistics of Tehri-Garhwal are not included in these figures. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 7. The number of operations performed by medical subordinates at dispen- saries during 1906-07 was only 261( 3 ) Diagram. 10. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vacci- nation in each district is attached. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 11. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and District Superintendents of Vaccination inspected 159,947 operations( 4 ) In all, 97 cow calves and 36 buffalo calves were operated upon during the period under report. As was the case last year, passage of the lymph through the buffalo was found useful in keeping up the strength of the strain. Cow calves yielded on an average 4.4 drms. and buffalo calves 6.2 drms. of crude lymph. This is better than last year. Five cow and five buffalo calves proved unsuccessful, or yielded lymph which it was not considered desirable to issue. From this crude lymph 1,514.05 drms. of glycerine lymph, 518.75 of glycerine paste, 4¾ drms. of lanoline paste and 55 points were prepared. Glycerine lymph is used entirely for stock purposes, and lanoline paste only issued when asked for. During the year 113,945 tubes, 341¾ drms. of glycerine paste, 51¼ drms. gly- cerine lymph in bulk, 4¾ drms. lanoline paste and 55 points were issued. Returns of results from 100,150 primary and 16,766 secondary vaccinations have been received, and show a percentage of success of 88.2 and 46.9 respectively. I regard these percentages as satisfactory, as in some cases delay in the use of the lymph and other causes have led to failure due in no way to the character of the lymph supplied. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations in municipalities immediately under the observation of the Civil Surgeons is 90.4. The total expenditure on the depôt during 1906-07 was Rs. 5,741 including Rs. 1,160 on account of cost of stores received from England. Lymph to the value of about Rs. 3,500 was sold to native states, municipal- ities and private individuals, so that this depôt is largely self-supporting and should, as time goes on, become even more so. No lymph was collected in the hills this year and all the material to start seasonal vaccination in all districts except Lucknow was supplied from the depôt. The vesicle was established in almost all districts on due date. The demands of all civil and military Medical Officers were also met. The institution has been inspected at frequent intervals both by Captain J. C. Robertson, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd Circle, and myself. The credit of the successful working of the depôt is due to Captain Robertson. Conduct of officials. 13. The conduct of the officials was on the whole satisfactory. S. J. THOMSON, C.I.E., D.P.H.

No. 218/XVI-231B-15 OF 1907. FROM F. E. TAYLOR, ESQ., SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT. UNITED PROVINCES, To THE SANITARY COMMISSIONER, UNITED PROVINCES. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 25TH JULY 1907. SIR, ANITATION DEPT. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your notes on vaccination in the United Provinces during the year 1906, and to communicate the following remarks thereon. 2. The notes were received in the Secretariat eleven days after the due date. They should have been dated 9th July, the date on which the last sheets were returned to the Press, instead of 20th June (vide the orders on page 138, department III, Manual of Government Orders). 3. There has been a reduction in the number of persons vaccinated, which occurred in the first circle, and is explained to be due chiefly to weakness of children after famine and malarial fever, and the low birth-rate of certain districts. Attention is also drawn to the partial withdrawal of supervision in this circle in consequence of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, who is also Chief Plague Officer, having had to devote a considerable portion of his time to plague work, and insuffi- cient supervision is considered to have contributed to the decrease. This cause of complaint should not exist in the next vaccination season as a proposal is being made, for the approval of the Government of India, to have a whole-time Chief Plague Officer in addition to the regular staff of two Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, and the Lieutenant Governor hopes to see the lost ground more than made up. The working of the bovine lymph dépôt at Patwa Dangar continued satis- factory. 4. I am to request that you will convey the thanks of Govern- ment to the gentlemen, named in your letter no. 225/C, dated the 13th July 1907, who gave assistance in the cause of vaccination. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, F. E. TAYLOR, Secretary.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE UNITED PROVINCES OF AGRA AND OUDH FOR THE YEARS 1905-06, 1906-07 AND 1907-08. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] ALLAHABAD: PRINTED BY W.C. ABEL OFFG. SUPDT., GOVERNMENT PRESS, UNITED [PROVINCES. 1908.
[Prescribed maximum lengthTriennial Report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1905-06, 1906-07 and 1907-08. Period covered by the report. 1. THIS report deals with the triennial period 1905-06 to 1907-08, but more especially with the last year, as brief notes have been submitted for the preceding two years. Officers in charge of the Department. 2. During the period under report the charge of the office of Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent General of Vacci- nation, United Provinces, was held by me from 1st April 1905 to the end of March 1906, and again from 20th January 1908 to 31st March 1908, and by Lieutenant-Colonel S. J. Thomson, C.I.E., I.M.S., from 1st April 1906 to 16th January 1908. Area under vaccination. 3. The area under vaccination remained unaltered during the period under report. Constitution of the Depart- ment. (Statement No. II.) 4. No change has taken place in the constitution of this department during the triennium under report except that, as stated last year, the appointments of vaccinators made after the 27th November 1906 were declared non-pensionable, and the appointments of tube-fillers attached to the districts of Almora, Garhwal and Dehra Dun were abolished from 17th October 1906 in consequence of the reorganization of the staff attached to the bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal). Strength of the Department. (Statement No. II.) 5. There has been no change in the number (50) of assistant superinten- dents of vaccination in 1907-08. In 1905-06 the number of these officials was 49 (including one for the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal), but an addi- tional assistant superintendent of vaccination having been posted to Gorakhpur in 1906-07, the number was increased from 49 to 50 in that year. In 1907-08 the number of vaccinators was 931, as compared with 934 in 1906-07, and 933 in 1905-06( 2 ) General operations. (Statement No. I.) 8. The total number of persons vaccinated during 1907-08 was 1,702,139( 3 ) Successful vaccination and degree of protection afforded. (Statement No. I.) 10. As usual Garhwal shows the greatest number (121.04) of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population during 1907-08 as compared with 118.65 in 1906-07 and 105.70 in 1905-06( 4 ) Then in order come Hardoi with 94.71, Sitapur with 69.48, Lakhimpur with 59.74, Bisalpur with 57.66, Bahraich with 56.40, Jaunpur with 53.94 and Gonda with 51.55. Brindaban heads the list of municipalities which are worst protected, i.e. show the lowest number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, with 21.70. Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh follows with 24.75. Then in order come Sardhana with 24.86, Mainpuri with 25.46 and Nagina with 26.99. All these municipalities except Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh and Sardhana show an improvement over the last year. In Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh small-pox was prevalent and interfered with vaccination work, whereas in Sardhana the decrease is stated to be due to low birth-rate and laziness on the part of the vaccinator who has been punished. The number of children under one year of age available for vaccination in the municipalities of these Provinces and the number of successful operations performed on them are shown in Appendix B. In some municipalities the number of children successfully vaccinated exceeded the number available. As explained in previous reports this is due to the fact that children born outside municipalities were brought in to be vaccinated, and that probably the ages of children are often incorrectly estimated by vaccinators. Vaccination in cantonments. 16. The total number of operations performed in the cantonments of these Provinces during 1907-08 was 13,825( 5 ) revaccination, against 30.41 and 31.01 in the preceding triennial period. As regards the inspection of primary cases, the percentage was highest (92.45) in Naini Tal. Jalaun follows with 77.18 and Almora with 61.68. Then in order come Dehra Dun with 57.67, Etawah with 54.08, Pilibhit with 53.96 and the Native State Tehri-Garhwal with 53.10. The districts showing low percentages were Cawnpore with 4.43, Sitapur with 9.57, Gonda with 15.54 and Rae Bareli with 15.66. The work of the assistant superintendent of vaccination at Cawnpore is not satisfactory. He has been lately transferred from Sitapur where he is said to have encouraged falsification of returns. Enquiries are being made and on the case being proved he will be suitably dealt with. The assistant superintendent of vaccination at Sitapur is a new man : moreover the returns of previous years are said to have been falsified here as stated above. As regards Gonda and Rae Bareli, the attention of the assistant superintendents of vaccination will be called to the matter. Referring to inspections of revaccination the percentage was highest (100.00) in Sultanpur. Jalaun follows with 87.05. Then in order come Dehra Dun with 59.98, Naini Tal with 47.80, Allahabad with 46.90, Etawah with 45.53 and Almora with 41.93. The districts showing low percentages are Mirzapur with 1.25, Aligarh with 1.69 and Agra with 2.73. Revaccinations were not inspected in Muzaffarnagar, Mainpuri, Cawnpore, Hardoi, Basti, Ghazipur and Ballia. The attention of the assistant superintendents of vaccination concerned will be called to the matter. Bovine lymph depôts. 19. Bovine lymph depôts were maintained at Lucknow and Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal) during the triennium under report, but since the depôt at the latter station is now in a posi- tion to meet fully the requirements of these Provinces, it is proposed to close that at the former station. One hundred and fourteen calves were operated upon at the Lucknow depôt in 1907-08 against 107 in 1906-07 and 106 in 1905-06. Of these, 113 were successful in 1907-08, 107 in 1906-07 and 104 in 1905-06. Forty-one thousand two hundred and thirty points of simple lymph, 420 tubes of glycerinated lymph and 15 oz. and 3 drms. of lanoline lymph were obtained in 1907-08, 39,709 points of simple lymph and 440 tubes of glycerinated lymph in 1906-07 and 37,679 points of simple lymph and 450 tubes of glycerinated lymph in 1905-06. During the last two years the quantity of lanoline lymph was the same as in 1907-08, i.e. 15 oz. and 3 drms. The expenditure on this depôt amounted to Rs. 1,532 in 1907-08, against Rs. 1,265 in 1906-07 and Rs. 1,044 in 1905-06. The excellent work done by the bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar requires special mention. This institute was started for the supply of pure fortified calf lymph in 1904 and the progress since made is shown below :( 6 ) areas will utilize this lymph for their requirements. Besides the municipalities, the chief purchasers of the lymph were the East Indian Railway at Allahabad and Native States (specially those in Bundelkhand). What is especially interest- ing in this connection is the increasing demand for lymph in small quantities by private individuals and practitioners. Rupees 166 worth lymph was thus sold in 1907-08 against Rs. 116 in 1906-07 and Rs. 48 in 1905-06. The price at which lymph is sold in quantities over 24 tubes, viz., Rs. 3 per 100 tubes of cow calf lymph and Rs. 2-8-0 per 100 tubes of buffalo calf lymph, is just sufficient to cover the cost of production. In Great Britain six pence per tube is usually charged against one anna per tube charged here for quantities of 24 tubes and under, so that we produce and sell much cheaper than at home and the results are equally, if not more, satisfactory. During 1907-08,184 calves( 7 ) Munich and Cologne they rely on 10 days' contact with glycerine admixture as sufficient to kill off all extraneous micro-organisms. On the Continent they rarely or never make plate cultures now-a-days. Up to recently we relied on air pressure for filling tubes and I am greatly indebted to Major J. Entrican, I.M.S., of Meiktila (Burma) for the loan of his machine for rapidly filling tubeseach district of the United Provinces. *it.

For Read Remarks. 1 Rs. 0-3-2 Rs. 0-2-3 Against North-West Frontier Province in para- graph 4. 98,495 98,485 In the 9th line of paragraph 5. 80.85 80.84 NOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1908-9. Brief notes on vaccination in 1908-9. A detailed report for the triennial period 1905-6 to 1907-8 having been submitted last year, these notes deal only with 1908-9 and are brief. Constitution and strength of the Department. (Statement No.II.) 2. There has been no change in the constitution of the Department during 1908-9 except that the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares, which had hither- to been included in the Benares and Mirzapur districts, were constituted a separate district for vaccination purposes and a separate Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination was posted there. There are now 51 Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination, including one for the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal and one for the Family Domains. The number of vaccinators employed in these provinces in 1908-9 was 927 against 931 in the preceding year. Expenditure on vaccination. ( Statement No. II.) 3. The total expenditure on vaccination during 1908-9 was Rs. 1,77,625 against Rs. 1,62,530 in the preceding year. The increase is chiefly due to the increased expenditure on the bovine lymph depôt at Patwa Dangar, as explained later on, and to the facts that (a) there were two full-time Deputy Sani- tary Commissioners for about 10½ months of the year and that (b) municipalities and notified areas purchased Rs. 2,672 worth more lymph during 1908-9 than in 1907-8. Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination. ( Statement No. II.) 4. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination during 1908-9 was two annas and one pie against one anna and seven pies in the preceding year, including the pay, &c., of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, but excluding these charges the average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna and nine pies against one anna and four pies in 1907-8. The increase under this head was not only due to the increased expenditure on vaccination explained in the preceding paragraph, but also to a certain extent to the falling off in the number of operations performed during the year under report. The cost of each successful vaccination in other provinces in 1907-8, was as follows :( 2 ) Second, except in the case of re-vaccinations, due to the fact that the districts which suffered most from malaria are almost all situated in the First Circle. The period of the greatest prevalence of the disease coincided with the first half of the vaccination season, when work at one time was nearly at a standstill, there being no children available for vaccination and, moreover, the vaccination staff also suffer- ed greatly from the epidemic. Famine also helped to reduce the number of children physically fit for vac- cination while to a certain extent small-pox, measles and low birth-rate were also responsible for the falling off in the work. In a few districts the causes of decrease given by the District Superintendents of Vaccination are other than those mentioned here, e. g., in Ballia plague was the cause ; in Mirzapur and Benares the decrease is to a certain extent due to the fact that the vaccination work hitherto done in the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares was included in those districts, but in the year under report it has been shown separately for reasons given in paragraph 2 above, in Mirzapur the work of the assistant superintendent of vaccination and some vaccinators was also unsatis- factory ; in Azamgarh plague inoculation scare, while in Muzaffarnagar and Cawnpore cholera was a cause of decrease in addition to malaria. Comparison with 1879( 3 ) Diagram. 10. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small- pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district is attached. Vaccination in proportion to births. 11. During the year under report the number of successful primary vacci- nations in proportion to births was 44.37 for children under one year, 22.15 for those over one and under six years and 69 94 for all age periods, against 48.71, 23.90 and 76.47 respectively, in 1907-8. The percentage for children under one year for the First Circle dur- ing 1908-9 was 49.61 against 38.86 for the Second Circle, the percentages for the preceding year being 59.44 and 38.38 respectively. The reasons for the discre- pancy in the figures of the two circles have been explained in previous reports. The statistics of Tehri-Garhwal are not included in the above figures. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement No. III.) 12. The total number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during the year under report was only 765( 4 ) re-vaccination,against 97.25 and 80.56 respectively,in 1907-8. Among the districts showing high percentages of inspections of primary cases, Pilibhit stands first with 58.00. Jalaun comes next with 40.01. Then in order come Garhwal with 32.56, Bijnor with 29.24 and Fatehpur with 27.95 The districts showing lowest per- centages are Allahabad and Naini Tal, each with 1.55. No inspections were made in Dehra Dun, Agra, Tehri-Garhwal, Cawnpore and Gorakhpur. The total number of vaccination operations inspected by Assistant Superin- tendents of Vaccination or other inspecting officers in 1908-9 was 498,861( 5 ) There was also a satisfactory increase in income as shown above. Lymph was supplied free to the military department, to District Superintendents of Vaccina- tion for district use and charitable institutions and jails to the amount of about Rs. 3,385. The expenditure on the depôt rose from Rs. 6,717 in 1907-8 to Rs. 12,578 in 1908-9. The increase is chiefly due to the large quantity of stores (chemicals and apparatus) purchased from England and in India and to the enter- tainment of another clerk in the office attached to the depôt. The contingent charges have also increased with the extension of the operations of the depôt. Endeavour is being made to replace arm-to-arm vaccination by calf lymph through- out these provinces and four districts (Naini Tal, Dehra Dun, Lucknow and Rae Bareli) received regular supplies of lymph, free of cost, from the depôt but in some remote parts of the Naini Tal district arm-to-arm vaccination was done. More districts will be taken in hand this year as it is proposed to extend the system gradually. Ninety-eight municipalities and notified areas were regularly supplied on payment with lymph each week against 64 in the preceding year. Native states purchased lymph to the value of Rs. 1,161 and the Chief Medical Officer, East Indian Railway, Allahabad, took Rs. 452 worth. Returns of results have been received for 200,039 primary and 44,529 second- ary operations (excluding unknown cases) performed with lymph supplied from the depôt in 1908-9 and show a percentage of success of 91.8 and 65.0 respectively, during the period from October 1908 to March 1909, and 74.0 and 46.2 respectively, during the period from April to September 1908ccination, in each district of the United Provinces.

Not available In columns 21NOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1909-10. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. (Statement No. II.) THERE has been no change in the constitution of the department during 1909-10. The number of vaccinators employed in these provinces during the year under report was 931 against 927 in the preceding year. Expenditure on Vaccination. (Statement No. II.) 2. The total expenditure on vaccination in these provinces during 1909-10 amounted to Rs. 1,71,345 against Rs. 1,77,625 in the preceding year( 2 ) have been given by the District Superintendents of Vaccination, e.g. in Sitapur better supervision by the new assistant superintendent of vaccination and conse- quent prevention of false work is said to be an additional cause; in Ballia and Azamgarh the decrease is attributed to the prevalence of plague and in the latter district to a certain extent also to the slackness on the part of some vaccina- tors who have been punished, while in Hamirpur the transfer of an experienced vaccinator on promotion is given as one of the causes for decrease. Successful vaccination and degree of protection afforded. (Statement No. I.) 6. As usual, Garhwal shows the greatest number (99.92) of persons success- fully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, followed by Naini Tal with 54.99 and Almora with 51.47. Then in order come the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal with 50.31, Jhansi with 47.27 and Hamirpur with 41.47. Among the districts showing the lowest number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popu- lation Muttra again stands first with 16.02. Bara Banki follows with 16.73. Then in order come Farrukhabad with 18.03, Bareilly with 20.27 and Mainpuri with 20.37. The causes have been explained above but Muttra, Farrukhabad, Bareilly and Mainpuri show an improvement over the preceding year. Mortality from small-pox. 7. The death-rate from small-pox per mille of population in 1909 was .12 against 1.26 in the preceding year and .45 the quin- quennial average. Diagram. 8. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vacci- nation in each district is attached. Vaccination in proportion to births. 9. In 1909-10 the number of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births was 48.80 for children under one year, 24.75 for those over one and under six years and 76.90 for all age periods, against 44.37, 22.15 and 69.94 respectively in the preceding year. The percentage for children under one year for the First Circle during 1909-10 was 58.03 against 40.48 for the Second Circle, the percentages for the preceding year being 49.61 and 38.86 respectively. The discrepancy in the figures of the two circles has been explained in previous reports. The statistics of Tehri-Garhwal are not included in the above figures. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement No. III.) 10. There was a great decline in the number of vaccination operations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries in 1909-10( 3 ) the preceding year and the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population 32.28 and 28.11 respectively. Vaccination Act. 14. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and cantonments and in 36 notified areas, including one to which it was applied during the year. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 15. The total number of vaccination operations inspected by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the District Superin- tendents of Vaccination in 1909-10 was 197,430( 4 ) The income of the dépôt during 1909-10 amounted to Rs. 8,527 as shown above but lymph to the value of Rs. 7,721 was supplied free of cost to the Military Depart- ment, to District Superintendents of Vaccination for district use, to charitable institutions and to jails. It has now been decided by Government that the supply of lymph free of cost to the Military Department as well as for district use should be discontinued and that it should be charged for as in the case of municipalities. The expenditure on the dépôt was Rs. 10,524 only during 1909-10 against Rs. 12,573 in the preceding year. In eight districts (Naini Tal, Dehra Dun, Agra, Meerut, Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur) arm-to-arm vaccination has now been done away with and vaccination is carried on with calf lymph supplied from the dépôt. The total number of primary operations performed in these provinces in 1909-10 with calf lymph was 252,213 and of re-vaccinations 27,125 against 157,852 and 19,535 respectively in 1908-9. By gradually increasing each year the number of districts to which a full supply of calf lymph is given it is hoped to gradually abolish arm-to-arm vaccination altogether. All the 87 municipalities and 32 notified areas received their supplies of lymph on payment from the depôt during 1909-10 against 79 and 19 respectively in the preceding year. A number of Native States and the Chief Medical Officer, East Indian Railway, purchased lymph to the value of Rs. 1,648 from the dépôt. Returns of results have been received for 197,842 primary operations and 14,569 re-vaccinations (excluding unknown cases) performed with lymph supplied from the depôt and these show a percentage success of 84.3 and 46.7 respectively during the period from April to September 1909 and 95.6 and 70.2 during the period from October 1909 to March 1910 against 74.0, 46.2, 91.8 and 65.0 respectively in the preceding year. The strain of lymph, as the above figures show, was very satisfactory but in order to keep up its potency the lymph in stock was frequently fortified by passage through the rabbit. Lymph was obtained from Berlin and a new strain started but as the vesicles were poor it was not continued further. There has always been a difficulty in getting the lymph to carry well to stations in the plains during the hot weather. Ordinary Thermos flasks were tried but these are not of a suitable shape and their use had to be discarded owing to their liability to breakages. To start seasonal work in these provinces glycerinated calf lymph was supplied free of cost to all District Superintendents of Vaccination as usual and the first supply was issued on 13th September 1909 and repeated bi-weekly until the vesicle was well established which was accomplished in almost all districts on the due date. In February 1910 three calves died from foot-and-mouth diseaseDiagra accination in each district of the United Provinces. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

Page. ForTriennial report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1908-9,1909-10 and 1910-11. Period covered by the report. This report covers the triennial period 1908-9 to 1910-11, but it deals more especially with the last year as brief notes have already been submitted on the work of the preceding two years. Officers in charge of the de- partment. 2. During the triennium under review the charge of the office of Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent-General of Vacci- nation, United Provinces, was held by Lieutenant- Colonel J. Chaytor White, I.M.S., from 1st April 1908 to 25th March 1910, and by me from 26th March 1910 to 31st March 1911, while. Lieutenant-Colonel J. Chaytor White was on leave. Constitution of the department. 3. In 1908-9 the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares, which formerly had been included in the Benares and Mirzapur districts, were constituted a separate district for vaccination purposes and the vaccination statistics of the Domains have since then been shown separately in the vaccination reports and returns. In 1910-11, with the approval of Government, the control of vaccination in the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal was taken over by the Tehri Darbar and the vaccination statistics of that State have therefore been omitted this year. Otherwise the area under vaccination to which the report refers is the same as formerly. Strength of the department. (Statement II.) 4. In 1908-9 a separate assistant superintendent of vaccination was appointed for the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares, raising the number of these officials to 51, and in 1910-11, for the reasons given above, the assistant superintendent of vaccination of the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal was placed under the control of the Tehri Darbar. There were thus 50 assistant superintendents of vaccination in 1910-11 against 51 in the preceding two years. As-regards vaccinators, the number employed in 1910-11 was 933 as against 931 and 927 (including the Tehri staff) in 1909-10 and 1908-9 respectively( 2 ) Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 6. Including the pay &c., of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces, excluding the Native State of Tehri-Garhwal, was two annas in 1910-11 against two annas and one pie in each of the two preceding years, but excluding the abovenamed charges the average cost was one anna and eight pies in 1910-11, as against one anna and eight pies and one anna and nine pies in 1909-10 and 1908-9 respectively. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination during the triennial period under report was, including all charges, two annas and one pie as compared with one anna and six pies in the preceding triennium. The increase under this head ,is accounted for by the explanation given in the preceding paragraph. The cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces during the last three years is compared below' with that in other provinces :( 3 ) The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 28.42 in 1910-11, 27.33 in 1909-10 and 28.19 in 1908-9( 4 ) five years in these districts being 65.88 and .33, 37.58 and .82, 42.14 and .04 and 41.16 and 1.02 respectively. In Garhwal and Naini Tal the rates, though higher than those of other districts in 1910-11, are lower as compared with 1909-10( 5 ) comes next with 68.77. Then in order come Kalpi (Jalaun) with 63.22, Bahraich with 58.16, Lakhimpur (Kheri) with 57.17, Jaunpur with 56.39, Naini Tal with 53.88, Gonda with 53.63 and Jhansi with 51.77. Among the worst protected municipalities are Mainpuri with 19.89 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, Brindaban with 21.04, Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh with 21.29, Ghazipur with 21.34 and Nawabganj (Bara Banki) with 21.48. In Mainpuri, Brindaban and Nawabganj the numbers, though low, show an improvement upon those of the preceding year. In Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh the low rate is stated to be due to the prevalence of plague and in Ghazipur to the same cause and also because the permanent vaccinator's work being bad he was dismissed and another man appointed in his place but the work of the latter also was not satisfactory. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in the different municipalities of these provinces are shown in Appendix B. Vaccination in cantonments. 15. The total number of vaccination operations performed in cantonments in 1910-11 was 8,584( 6 ) 507,390( 7 ) gives the yearly output, extension of the areas where arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination, expenditure and income, but it has been much hampered by the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply of suitable calves. This year however arrangements have been made by which it is hoped this difficulty will, to a great extent, disappear, and the complete replacement of arm-to-arm, by calf lymph, vaccination in all the districts be made possible in the near future.

This has resulted in a large increase of income to the depôt, so that it is now being worked at a slight profit instead of a loss. In 1910-11 the income was Rs. 14,211( 8 ) doubtful vesicles are now discarded and only the best used for lymph collection, and (2) in no calf is the groin, mammary area, scrotum or line of the penis vaccinated. By using only the best vesicles the strain of lymph is strengthened, and by the limitation of the vaccination area the calves are saved a good deal of pain. From the crude lymph obtained in 1910-11, 27,408.8 grammes of glycerinated lymph, 1,169.8 grammes of glycerine paste and 30.2 grammes of lanoline paste were prepared as against 22,941.6, 1,713.4 and 37.2 grammes, respectively, in 1909- 10 and 15,843.1, 2,034.8 and 27.4 grammes in 1908-9. In 1910-11, as in previous years, glycerinated calf lymph was supplied to all District Superintendents of Vaccination in time to start the seasonal work, and the vesicle was established in practically all the districts on the due date. The total number of primary operations performed in these provinces in 1910-11 with calf lymph was 382,280 and that of revaccinations 25,651, against 252,213 and 27,125, respectively, in 1909-10, and 157,852 and 19,535 in 1908-9. Returns of results have been received for 277,045 primary operations and 16,767 revaccinations (excluding unknown cases) and these show a percentage success of 95.5 and 56.1 respectively during the period from April to September 1910 (hot weather) and 95.8 and 62.6 during the period from October 1910 to March 1911 (cold weather) as against 84.3, 46.7,95.6 and 70.2, respectively, in 1909-10 and 74.0, 46.2, 91.8 and 65.0 in 1908-9. The strain of lymph therefore was eminently satisfactory. There is still however some difficulty in getting the lymph to its destination in the plains at full potency during the hot weather. Various methods of packing have been tried, but none have given quite satisfactory results. The point is one of importance and at present further experiments with &quot; thermetots &quot; are in progress. The depôt was frequently inspected by the Sanitary Commissioner as well as by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Second Circle, who is in charge of the institution. As noted above, the work of the depôt has very largely extendedDiagranlation protected by vaccination in each [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

( 4A ) APPENDIX A.( 5A ) and ratio of deaths from small-pox in each district of the United Provinces for a yearsParagraph 14.] ( 6A ) APPENDIX B.( 7A ) APPENDIX B.ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 536/XVI( 2 ) of small-pox in the last two years and to the fact that in the hill tracts the inhabitants do not resort to this measure so freely as they did since they have discovered that it is not compulsory. But these causes do not affect primary operations, and the decrease in them can only be put down to the prevalence of plague, which in many districts has caused the vaccinator, owing to a resemblance between his duties and those of the inoculator, to be regarded with suspicion. It is, however, a matter for congratulation that the mortality from small-pox has been extremely low in the last two years. In 1910 the number of deaths from this cause, 873, was the lowest ever recorded. At the same time it is essential that efforts should not be relaxed, and that the staff of the Vaccination department should endeavour to maintain, if not to surpass, the standard of work done in the past. 2. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator as usual varied widely, the extremes in 1910-11 being 928 in Lucknow and 2,605 in Garhwal. The average for the vaccinators of the whole province in the same year was 1,525, which is practically the same as that for the period under review. 3. The average annual expenditure on vaccination during the triennium was Rs. 1,72,467 as compared with Rs. 1,54,881 for the years 1905 to 1908. The increase is due to the extension of the work of the Patwa Dangar lymph dépôt, and to the employment of two Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. The cost of each successful vaccination was 2 annas 1 pie in 1908-9 and 1909-10, and 2 annas in 1910-11. The cost in other provinces in the latter year varied from 1 anna 6 pies in Bengal to 9 annas 3 pies in Bombay. 4. The number of operations inspected by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and District Superintendents shows a considerable increase during the triennium, but the number of inspections made by assistant superintendents and other officers declined. The Lieutenant Governor hopes that district officials will endeavour to pay more atten- tion to this important duty in the future. 5. The lymph dépôt at Lucknow has been finally closed, and the only dépôt now maintained in the province is that at Patwa Dangar. The work at this dépôt has increased very considerably during the period under review, and the output of lymph issued has more than doubled. Now that the Military department, municipalities and native states pay half rates for their supplies instead of receiving them free, as was formerly the case, the business is being carried on at a small profit and no longer at a loss. In all the municipalities, in nearly all the notified areas, and in thirteen districts of the province arm-to-arm vaccination, has now been replaced by vaccination with pure calf-lymph. 6. The Lieutenant Governor desires that the gentlemen named in the Sanitary Commissioner's letter no. 4688-44H., dated the 16th August 1911, who gave assistance in the cause of vaccination, should be thanked. To Major J. C. Robertson, I.M.S., the Officiating Super- intendent General of Vaccination, his acknowledgements are due for a very thorough report.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNOTES on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1911-12. Brief notes on vaccination in 1911-12. As a detailed report for the triennial period 1908-09 to 1910-11 was submitted last year, this report deals briefly with vaccination in 1911-12 as compared with 1910-11. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) 2. During the year 1911-12 there has been no change in the strength of the department with the exception that on the 1st of April 1911 the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares were constituted &quot;the State of Benares&quot; and the control of vaccination in that State was taken over, with the approval of the Government, by His Highness the Maharaja. The vaccination staff and statistics of the State have therefore been excluded from all the returns of this year's report. In consequence of this omission during the year 1911-12 the strength of the vaccination establishment consisted of 49 assistant superintendents of vaccination and 927 vaccinators against 50 and 933 respectively in 1910-11. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. The total expenditure on vaccination in 1911-12, including the pay, &c., of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, amounted to Rs. 1,81,792 against Rs. 1,68,697 in the preceding year ; but if the above named charges are excluded the expenditure in the year under report amounted to Rs. 1,53,200 against Rs. 1,43,144 during the preceding year. The increase in expenditure in 1911-12 as compared with 1910-11 is chiefly due to the facts that (a) two full-time Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were employed for a longer period than last year but, as will be explained in the succeeding paragraph, the expenditure incurred in the pay and emoluments of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices should not be debited to the Vaccination department or shown in Statement II appended to the report and (b) increased expenditure on the production of calf lymph at the bovine lymph depôt to meet the demands of local bodies. Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination, (Statement II.) 4. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination during 1911-12 was one anna and seven pies, or exactly the same as in 1910-11, if for comparison the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares are excluded. In these averages the cost of the bovine lymph depôt and the pay, &c., of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices have not been taken into account, firstly, because if the expenses of the depôt were included there would be a double entry of identically the same expenditure returned under the headings( 2 ) General operations. (Statement I.) 5. In compliance with the orders of the Government of India contained in G. G. O. (Department of Education/Sanitary), no. 1510, dated the 16th August 1911, a summary showing the number of vaccination operations performed by the special and dispensary staffs has been appended to Statement I. The total number of persons vaccinated during the period under report was 1,484,653 (1,381,649 primarily vaccinated and 103,004 re-vaccinations) as compared with 1,405,923 in 1910-11. The total number of operations performed was 1,494,557 (1,391,266 primary and 103,291 re-vaccinations) against 1,413,805 in the preceding year. The figure 9,904 obtained by subtracting the number of persons vaccinated from the number of operations performed represents the number of secondary operations. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccina- tor in 1911-12 was 1,621 against 1,527 in 1910-11. The proportion per mille of the population successfully vaccinated in 1911-12 was 30.26 as compared with 28.47 in the preceding year. Primary vaccinations.( 3 ) Mortality from small pox. 9. The death-rate from small pox in 1911 was .03 against .02 in 1910 and .43, the quinquennial average. Diagram. 10. A diagram is attached showing the relation between the death-rate from small pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 11. The number of vaccinations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during 1911-12 was 384( 4 ) the incumbent of the Civil Surgeoncy no tour was made in the district and the few cases inspected were seen at the headquarters. The total number of vaccination operations inspected by the assistant superintendents of vaccination or other inspecting officers in 1911-12 was 556,920 ( 5 ) The decrease in the issue of lymph in glass capillary tubes and the increase in the supply in bulk are due to the introduction of the method of supplying lymph in metal collapsible tubes which are cheaper than glass tubes. This method has also resulted in the reduction of labour. The price of lymph issued in bulk has therefore been reduced from Rs. 3 to Rs. 2 per drachm. Notwithstanding the decrease in price, the receipts rose from Rs. 14,211 in 1910-11 to Rs. 18,780 in 1911-12 (Rs. 18,521 from sale of lymph and Rs. 259 from that of milk, &c.,) excluding the cost (Rs. 68) of lymph issued free during the year, whereas the expenditure amounted to Rs. 13,030 only in 1911-12 against Rs. 12,097 in the preceding year. All the 87 municipalities and 45 notified areas in these provinces received, on payment, their supplies of lymph from the depôt during 1911-12 against 87 and 37 respectively in 1910-11. Arm-to-arm vaccination has now been replaced by vacccination with calf lymph in 22 districts, nine districts having been added during the year under report. Four districts received regular supplies in small quantities in the latter part of the season. It is proposed to supply during the ensuing season calf lymph to 11 additional districts, bringing the total up to 33 districts. Several native states and the Chief Medical Officer, East Indian Railway, also purchased lymph to the value of Rs. 1,079 in 1911-12 against Rs. 1,055 in 1910-11. The total number of primary operations performed in these provinces in 1911- 12 with calf lymph was 764,699 and that of re-vaccinations 48,514 against 382,280 and 25,651 respectively in 1910-11. Returns of results have been received for 457,980 primary vaccinations and 27,852 re-vaccinations (excluding unknown cases) and these show a percentage success of 90.7 and 44.2 respectively during the period from April to September 1911 (hot weather) and 97.1 and 65.3 during the period from October 1911 to March 1912 (cold weather) against 95.5, 56.1, 95.8 and 62.6 respectively in the preceding year. The strain of lymph was satisfactory. In order to keep up its potency it was frequently fortified by passage through rabbits. Experiments with Thermos flasks are still in progress. Glycerinated calf lymph was supplied to all District Superintendents of Vaccination, as usual, in time to start the seasonal work and the vesicle was established in almost all districts on the due date. The depôt was frequently inspected by the Sanitary Commissioner and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd Circle, who is in charge of the institu- tion. From the statement of the above facts and figures it is evident that the work of the depôt has considerably extended and is extending year by year. The staff attached to the depôt requires strengthening and for carrying this out proposals have been submitted to Government. S. A. HARRISS, M.B., CM., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H.

[Prescribed maximum lengthERRATA to the Notes on Vaccination in the United Provinces during 1912-13. Page. ForNotes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1912-13. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) DURING the year under review two additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were appointed in these provinces, which were consequently subdivided into four ranges, as shown in the statements appended to these notes. The pay of the 3rd and 2nd grade assistant superintendents of vaccination and of vaccinators was revised with effect from 1st April 1912. The pay of first grade assistant superintendents of vaccination, revised in 1893, remained unaltered. Under the new scale the monthly pay of 3rd and 2nd grade assistant superintendents of vaccination was raised from Rs. 18 and Rs. 24 to Rs. 30 and Rs. 35 respectively ; and that of vaccinators, which formerly varied from Rs. 6 to Rs. 10 only, was increased to Rs. 8 rising to Rs. 20, the increments corresponding to the length of service. Concurrently with the introduction of these revised rates of pay, the extra allowances, which were formerly drawn by assistant superintendents of vaccination and vaccinators in certain districts, were withdrawn. Full details of the changes introduced were published in Government Notification No. 99/XVI( 2 ) General operations. (Statement I.) 4. The total number of persons vaccinated during 1912-13 in these provinces was 1,579,432 (1,455,658 primarily vaccinated and 123,774 re-vaccinated) against 1,484,653 in 1911-12( 3 ) Third Range the number and the proportion of successful primary operations to births were 156,421 and 47.99 per cent. respectively in 1912-13 against 152,695 and 48.57 in the preceding year. In the Fourth Range the number and proportion of successful primary vaccinations to births were 185,789 and 37.99 per cent. in 1912-13 as compared with 177,989 and 37.36 in the preceding year. Although there were only two circles in 1911-12, the statistics for 1911-12 have been prepared for the four ranges for purposes of comparison. Mortality from small-pox. 8. The mortality from small-pox in 1912 was .07 per mille of population as compared with .03 in 1911 and .38 the quinquennial average. Diagram. 9. A diagram is attached showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 10. The number of vaccinations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries during the year under report was 933( 4 ) the 31st of Jan ary on delivering lectures and demonstrations at Lucknow in hygiene to the candidates for the appointments of health officers and apprentice sanitary inspectors and of one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from the 1st of January to 31st March on lectures in advanced hygiene and laboratory instructions in food and water analysis for health officers. The percentage of inspections to the total number vaccinated was 15.63 for primary vaccinations and 13.98 for revaccinations in 1912-13 as compared with 15.53 and 10.38 respectively in the preceding year. The percentage of cases found successful to the total number inspected in 1912-13 was 97.07 for primary vaccination and 61.25 for re-vaccination against 97.23 and 59.61 respectively in the preceding year. Out of 227,576 primary vaccinations inspected, the largest numbers were seen in Azamgarh (13,348), Fatehpur (11,910), Jaunpur (10,629), Mainpuri (8,681), Partabgarh (8,581) and Shahjahanpur (8,399). Taking percentages in order of precedence, Fatehpur again stands first with 56.94 followed by Jalaun with 38.14, Mainpuri with 36.21, Azamgarh with 33.93, Partabgarh with 32.74, and Garhwal with 31.11. No inspections were made in the Agra district and only 161 vaccinations were inspected in Lucknow and 196 in Gorakhpur. In Dehra Dun the inspections (159) made by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in April 1912 were shown by mistake in his office in the notes for 1911-12 and they have not therefore been included in this year's totals. In the districts noted above in which the number of inspections is small the District Superintendents of Vaccination are not required to make vaccination tours. The total number of vaccination operations inspected by the assistant superintendents of vaccination or other inspecting officers in the year under report was 623,381 (569,096 primary and 54,285 re-vaccinations) against 556,920 in 1911-12( 5 ) the calves were inoculated. Inoculation syringes and anti-rinderpest serum have recently been purchased and all calves which come from infected districts are now inoculated on arrival at the quarantine station. Four hundred and twenty-three calves (including one left over from the preceding year and one born in the dépôt) were received in the dépôt during 1912-13. Of these, 386 calves (259 cow and 127 buffalo) were vaccinated; 24 died unvaccinated (chiefly of rinderpest) ; one died while under operation ; one was vaccinated at the close of the season, and the lymph taken from it in April 1913 ; and 11 were left unvaccinated at the close of the year. Out of the 386 calves, 355 (239 cow and 116 buffalo) proved successful; 20 gave unsuccessful results and 11 were found in such a sickly condition that lymph was not taken from them. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained in 1912-13 was 11,285 grammes against 9,335.6 grammes in the preceding year( 6 ) the period from April to September 1912 (hot weather) and 96.8 and 71.6 during the period from October 1912 to March 1913 (cold weather) against 90.7, 44.2, 97.1 and 65.3 respectively in the preceding year. The strain of lymph was satisfactory and was fortified occasionally by passage through rabbits. To start the seasonal work glycerinated calf lymph was supplied in due time to all the District Superintendents of Vaccination in those districts still continuing to use arm-to-arm lymph and the vesicle was established in almost all these districts early in the vaccination season. Proposals for the increase in the pay and strength of the staff with effect from 1st April 1913 were sanctioned and a resident European Superintendent, Mr. D. F. MacArthur, was appointed from 4th November 1912. The dépôt was frequently inspected by the Sanitary Commissioner and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd Range, who is in charge of the institution.
