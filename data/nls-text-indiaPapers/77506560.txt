ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM, FOR THE YEAR 1868. Lahore, 1st January, 1869. During the past 12 months the following additions and improvements have been made to the Asylum buildings and premises :( 2 ) General cleanliness and supervision. The strictest supervision has been maintained over all portions of the Asylum, the slightest speck of dirt in the sleeping wards is at once removed, the wards are constantly leeped with fresh earth, and the upper portions whitewashed; and as regards cleanliness, I believe no improvements can be made.

The clothing has been the same description as heretofore ; the summer suits are issued early in April, and the winter ones in October. Straw mattresses, jhamps to the open doors, taut purdahs and extra blankets to the sick or infirm have been provided ; the greatest attention has been paid in keeping the clothing in good order and perfectly clean, while the patients themselves undergo ablution at the washing places built for this purpose. General and Medical His- tory. On the 1st of January, 1868, there were 205 patients under treatment, viz., males 166, females 39 ; and the admissions during the year have amounted to 171, making a total of 376. No. 3.( 4 ) It will be seen that the Asylum was healthy until August, and that the principal number of casualties took place in the months of September, October and November( 5 ) been under treatment for the past five years. This man is perfectly sane in all points except one, viz., his own excessive rank and importance ; he considers that he is an incarnation of the deity, and that every thing must bend to his will and dictates; the greater part of his time was spent in comtemplating his own features in the looking glass; but, though always violent when opposed, had never before committed any actual assault;( 6 ) of provisions, and considering that it includes establishment, dieting, clothing, bedding, bazar medicines and contingencies, 0-3-3 per man per diem cannot, I think, be considered extravagant. Occupation of lunatics. The occupation of the lunatics have continued of the same description as heretofore. Out of the full number of inmates, 161 have been constantly employed. Every care is taken to prevent the work being too laborious or irksome, and that it is suited to the strength and disposition of the in- dividual. Every patient capable of employment is encouraged and persuaded to oocupy his time, and good conduct is rewarded with sweetmeats, tobacco, &c. There can be no doubt that suitable occupation has the most beneficial effect, both mentally and physically, on lunatics. As a rule the conduct of the patients has been most orderly and quiet, and visitors constantly remarked that they could hardly believe they are mad, the majority being so quiet and well behaved. Establishment. Owing to increased loss of vision, Mr. Wilson, the former Deputy Superintendent, was obliged, in June last, to resign his appointment in the Asylum; the injuries he received on his head, and the nervous shock to his system resulting from the assault, no doubt had the effect of increasing his blindness. On representing this sad case, Government has generously granted him a small pension for life. Mr. Wilson's place has been filled up by Mr. A. Glegg, a retired Apothecary, and I believe a more fortunate selection could not have been made. Mr. Glegg possesses qualifications particularly suited for the appointment. His professional knowledge, com- bined with a thorough acquaintance with the habits and peculiarities of natives, together with a kind and considerate manner towards them, has already made him most popular and respected by all the inmates ; he has conducted his duties with the greatest zeal and discretion, and devotes his whole time and attention to the welfare of the lunatics and general supervision of the entire establishment and institution. The Native Doctor, Mirza Koodrut Ali, has continued to give me the greatest satis- faction. He suffered much from fever during the epidemic in November, but insisted in remaining at his post, until I compelled him to seek temporary change of air. His thorough acquaintance with the history and character of each individual lunatic renders him invaluable in the Asylum. Mrs. Sinnott, the matron, has performed her duties to my entire satisfaction, and a great improvement has taken place in the conduct and general discipline of the female ward, since she took charge of it. The rest of the establishment have also conducted their duties properly, and no instance of unnecessary harshness or bad treatment of lunatics has occurred. Commissions of Lunacy and Visitors. Commissions of Lunacy have been held on Criminal lunatics as occasion required, and the Asylum has been regularly inspected by the Official Visitors. C. M. SMITH, F. R. C.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB For 1870. LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM. HAVING taken charge of the Lunatic Asylum to-day from Dr. Smith, the duty of drawing out the Annual Report for 1870 devolves upon me. With one exception (the filtration of the water), I have had no personal knowledge of the events of the past year, nor have I as yet any intimate acquaintance with the internal arrangements of the Institution, but have prepared this report from notes left me by Dr. Smith. Buildings. No additions have been made to the buildings during the year 1870, but a few alterations and improvements have been carried out as follows:( 2 ) The principle is convenient; for water can be drawn quickly from the filter whenever wanted, instead of dripping through it, and being stored : never- theless, it does not yet completely succeed, as the powdered charcoal does not form a perfect filtering material, and other things that have been tried are open to objection. By further experiment, however, I hope I shall succeed in rendering the filtering process on this principle thoroughly effective. The accompanying sketch illustrates the prin- ciple. Eight pucka masonry platforms 4 feet square, one for each ward, have been built for these filters, and have been fenced with wooden railings, to prevent the lunatics from destroying them. The cost of the whole filtering apparatus, masonry platforms, &c., was Rs. 200. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Syphon filter. In December last Government sanctioned the building of a pucka tank, filtering reservoir, and water-courses for canal water; a place has been set apart in the vegetable garden for this purpose. The tank and reservoir will occupy an area of 87 feet square. The water will be brought from a rajbuha of the canal which runs by the north side of the asylum about a 100 yards distance across the Amritsar road. The work now is under construction ; as soon as it is finished, the canal water may be substituted for the well water for drinking, if it be considered desirable. 2nd,( 3 ) Diet. The diet of the lunatics has been of excellent quality, and sufficient in quantity. The atta is made into hand-cakes and baked in the asylum ovens, and rice is given in lieu of atta to those who prefer it. Mutton is issued twice a week in summer, and in winter three or four times a week, and made into curry with the vegetables of the season. Dhal and vegetables are given alternately when mutton is not issued. The food is divided into two meals, given at 9 A. M. and 5 P. M. The hospital diet is 4 ozs. less in quantity for each person, but extras are given, such as milk, soojee, rice, sugar, and mutton for broth. Rum is given as a stimulant to weakly cases only. The following is the Diet Table:( 4 ) Cost of a Lunatic. The cost of each lunatic during the year 1870, for diet, bedding and clothing, medicines, attendance of servants, and contingencies has been Rs. 80-1-7, which is 12 Rs. and 10 pie less than in the year 1869, as provisions during that year (1869) were almost at famine prices. Establishment. The establishment during the year has been revised, and the expense of it increased by Rs. 22 per mensem. The old designation of Native Doctor, Jemadar, Daffadar, and Burkundaze have been changed to 1st Class Hospital Assistant, Head Warder, and 1st, 2nd and 3rd Class Warders. The pay of the 1st Class Hospital Assistant is now Rs. 60; the Head Warder receives Rs. 15, and the other Warders Rs. 10, Rs. 8, and Rs. 7 each;( 5 ).

No. 1, or the Register, is omitted under instructions from His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor of the Punjab: it was a work of most superfluous labor; for the whole of the infor- mation to be gathered from it was to be gathered from the other statements. No. 2 is the Summary of the Register and Records. 58 patients were under treatment during the whole year, made up of 32 remaining on the 1st January, 25 newly-admitted lunatics, and 1 re-admitted. There have been fewer admissions in 1870 than in the three previous years. Remaining. Admissions. Total. 1867 ... 14 28 42 1868 ... 20 34 54 1869 ... 33 31 64 I explain this diminution in the number of admissions by the uncertainty under which we labored as regarded Budget provision. You will remember how in 1869 we were thrown into the greatest confusion owing to inadequate provision. Patients had slightly increased ; food was dear; and, after admonition and an additional grant, we tided through the difficulty. Owing to this and the delay in receiving information as to the Budget provision for the current financial year, none but absolutely bad and distressing cases could be admitted, lest our expenditure should exceed income,( 15 ) No. 7.( 16 ) Before concluding, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the presents of fruit and playthings from Lala Oomrao Sing and Lala Moheshree Dass, Municipal Commissioners. Amongst the pets we now muster two monkeys, a cat, a dog and a very fair show of pigeons. I have, &c., J. C. PENNY, M.D., Superintendent. No. 2. Abstract of Annual Return. Sex.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB For 1871-72. DEHLI LUNATIC ASYLUM. No. 51, dated Dehli, 21st March 1872. From( 2 ) There are four great wants,( 3 ) I know the difficulties of obtaining information, when perhaps the constable who seizes, the Thannadar or Deputy Inspector who receives the charge, is himself wanting in intelli- gence ; but it inflicts a terrible injury upon a native when he is incarcerated in a lock-up, or hand-cuffed and taken to the Lunatic Asylum, perhaps to wait information regarding him. The lunatics, when discharged from the Asylum are brought before the visitors, and in most cases are taken over by friends at the door, who give written security for their care and safe-keeping. In No. 5 Return it is shown that of the 41 admissions during 1871, 27 were sent in from Dehli; 4 came from Gurgáon ; 4 from Rohtak,( 4 ) Brahmins, máhajuns and bunias have their smoke at their own houses, generally every day in the afternoon. There are about 14 shops I understand in the city at which you may procure cannabis in varions forms. Bhang is a very cheap common form of Indian hemp, which is not smoked but drank and is prepared in the following manner:( 5 ) There is a state of brain produced by over-indulgence in bhang or churrus which corresponds tc delirium tremens. Suspension of its use may cause a state of most violent excitement. The patient talks incessantly, pelts others with bricks or stones, bites those about him, tears his clothes, and it will be dangerous to approach him. There is great thirst; craving for food. The skin is hot, but no fever. Decidedly sleepless, for he bawls and shouts all night. He may die from exhaustion of the brain or stoppage of the heart's action, from paralysis of the sympathetic, or he may gradually recover. Insanity or permanent disorder of the mind is a result of the evil habit of over-indulgence in this narcotic,( 6 ) The insane are not slow in sagacity and the power of comprehending what is done for their good, and thus will appreciate kindness. It is refreshing to think that the condition of the insanes of this country attracts so much attention; for there is no doubt that their condition was very miserable, and that they were much neglected. It is encouraging to state the fact that insanity is a disease which can be as successfully treated as any other, provided there be early seclusion, and this means of cure be appropriately adopted to the varying features of individual cases.

( 25 ) No. 1242, dated Lahore, 10th April 1872 From( 26 ) No. 1244, dated Lahore, 10th April 1872 From( 27 ) Defects in water-supply. 7. While on this subject, I may observe that Doctor Scriven considers that the tank recently erected in the Asylum garden for holding drinking-water is but ill suited for the pur- pose. The water is pumped into it from a small irrigating channel which has been brought a long distance from the canal, and which is subject throughout its course to pollution of every kind. Such impurities no form of filtration can eliminate. Quarantine wards. 8. There are quarantine wards outside the Asylum in which the lunatics newly received are kept for a short time before being admitted into the main building. There have been some escapes from these of late, and I think the wall should be raised and the bricks at the upper part plastered over so as to leave no resting-place for the foot. Comfort of inmates of Asy- lum attended to. 9. Everything appears to be done by Doctor Scriven to make the inmates of the Asylum as comfortable as the unfortunate circum- stances of their position will permit. Some alterations have been made in the sleeping wards, which will make them warmer in winter and cooler in summer. Arrangements have been made for cooling the wards in the hot weather by means of wet matting. The flower garden, which adds so much to the appearance of the Asylum, and must be a source of much pleasure to the inmates, is maintained in excellent order. Separate cells have been pro- vided for the more dangerous lunatics, and padded cells for those who are violent. 10. I consider that the state of the institution is satisfactory, and reflects credit on Doctor Scriven's careful management. Annual Report of the Lahore Lunatic Asylum for the year 1871, furnished by Dr. Scriven, Superintendent IN preparing this report I shall adopt, as nearly as possible, the plan observed in former years, omitting, however, such points as have been fully treated of before. Buildings. 2. Three cells have been built of pucka masonry in the criminal ward, and padded with canvas bags filled with straw. They are 12 feet by 10, and are ventilated by an opening in the door secured with bars, a window opposite the door, and a skylight. These were much needed, as the means of securing refractory lunatics and providing for the safety of epileptics and others likely to injure themselves was previously very defective. When refractory patients are confined in these wards it is generally found necessary to secure them with strait waistcoats, as most of them are very destructive, and would tear the padding to pieces if their hands were free. Applica- tion has been made for one similar cell in the female ward. Two cells( 28 ) ted to the Savings Fund of the Asylum. The water for drinking and culinary purposes is still drawn from the same well mentioned in last report. The mode of filtration there described is still adhered to, and found to answer better than any other mode that has yet been tried in the Asylum. I pointed out in last report that, though I was satisfied with the principle on which the filters worked, I considered them still capable of improvement in matters of detail, especially as regarded the filtering material. After numerous experiments, I have at last returned very nearly to the same material that I used in Calcutta in 1859. A sketch of one of these filters was given in last year's report, but it may perhaps be well, even at the risk of recapitulating some of the matter of that report, to describe them as they now stand:( 29 ) being expensive. I therefore adopted light moonj mats, which are hung like canvas purdas from the top of the door of the cells. These have not yet been used ; but I believe that, when watered, they will be found nearly as effective as khus khus tattees; and, being light, they can easily be pushed aside for the attendant to look into the cell. Their material is very cheap, and as they are so simple in construction that they can be made by the lunatics, the manufacture of them costs nothing. Management of cases on admission. 5. In order to avoid the chance of any contagious disorder being introduced into the Asylum, every insane person, on admission, is put into the quarantine ward. At the end of 10 days, if no contagious disorder have appeared, he is transferred either to the general ward or the criminal ward, or to the hospital, as the case may be. While in quarantine, he is carefully examined,( 30 ) Estimated va1ue of labor. 12. The estimated value of the lunatics' labor, at 1 anna per diem, has been Rs. 1,048 during the past year. Establishment. 13. The establishment now corresponds exactly with the scale sanctioned in the Proceed- ings of the Government of India, Financial Department, No. 1745, of March 16th, 1870, with the addition of one sardár dhobie and one bhistie, which have this year been sanctioned by the Local Government, besides which two additional warders are paid out of the Savings Fund. Now form of annual re- turn. 14. It will be observed that in the new statistical forms furnished above for the first time, returns are required for the past ten years. These I am unable to give, as the records of the old Asylum previous to 1863 do not contain all the necessary information. The present Asylum was opened in September 1863, and the patients from the old Asylum transferred to it. Mortality. 15. The percentage of deaths during 1871, though lamentably high (17.79 per cent.), is less than in any previous year of the existing institution, with the excep- tion of 1864, its first entire year, and 1870, which followed immediately on the cholera year 1869. The malarious months of 1871 (August, September, October, and November), and the cold months (January and February), have furnished the highest mortality. December, as already pointed out, has been exceptionally healthy. The very high mortality in this Asylum is, I believe, attributable to the severity of the cold season in the Punjab. It will probably be found impossible to diminish much the number of deaths during the malarious months of the year; but there is room for hope that the greater comfort of the institution and the improvement in its management, which will result from further experience, may in time bring within narrower limits the mortality of the cold season.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB, For the Year 1874. DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM. No. 246, dated 3rd March 1875. From( 2 ) Latrines. VI. Dry-earth system of conservancy is in use, and the poudrette is all buried in the regular sized trenches in the garden. The latrines are kept in good order, but it is very difficult to get the patients to use them. Employment. VII. No. 12 Return shows the various employments in which the lunatics have been engaged. I have had no mechanics or skilled workmen in the asylum, and the only lucrative work has been the collecting of ice from the jail ice-pits. It is difficult to estimate actually what the value of their labor was. I have calculated it low enough, viz., 6 pie per man per diem. This sum will be credited when the sale of the ice will give the jail power of payment. The rest of the return needs no comment. Rupees 58-12-0 have been credited to Government by sale of vegetables, grass and other asylum produce, the result of lunatic labor. Diet. VIII. The diet scale is the same as it was last year. I think that the women should have more food. I recommended last year that they should have the same quantity as the males. I understand that in the North-West Provinces the allowance of flour is 12 chattaks per diem for both males and females; here it is 10 chattaks for the former and 8 for the latter. This is not enough I fear, and the high death-rate of the females, contrasted with the very small mortality amongst the males, renders me very anxious to be allowed to increase the amount of the former's food. The women and men both complain of not having enough food, but I think, though the men both could and would eat more if they could get it, the women are only in absolúte want of an increase. There has been no scurvy. Cookery. IX. Cookery is very good, and the food of the best description. Water. X. Water is brought from a well close by ; it is both sweet and clean; it is boiled and filtered before issue. Clothing. XI Clothing is good and sufficient. That for the hot weather was given out on the 1st March; for the cold weather on the 16th October. It is the same as was detailed last year. It consists of as follows:( 3 ) the women appreciating them more than the men, especially the swings. They are also very fond of the pet animals. No escapes have been effected, and the general conduct of the patients has been good. Some of course are troublesome, and occasional slight outbreaks of violence take place, but there has been nothing of any importance or attended with any serious result. Expenditure. XIII. Expenditure has been as follows:( 4 ) His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, on his recent visit to this asylum in February last, entered the following minute in the visitors' book, viz.( 5 ) 4th February 1875. I INSPECTED the Lunatic Asylum at Delhi, and found great improvements in the place as well as in the health and appearance of the inmates. There are to-day 66 insanes in the asylum, of whom two are in hospital sick. I consider the diet and clothing now sufficient, and attribute the great improvement in the health and appearance of these poor creatures to the changes suggested by me in my former minutes. I do not think it necessary now to go into great datails, but I would mention that the mortality has decreased from 28.57 per cent. of deaths to strength for 1872, and from 17.77 for 1873, to the very moderate per- centage of 10.34 for 1874. The total admissions to hospital for other than mental diseases have been 34, i. e, 56.89 admissions per cent. of strength. I consider this number rather small, and I invite Dr. Taylor's attention to this point, because I consider that the mortality amongst the insane can only be kept moderately low by great care and watchfulness in detecting their little ailments, and thereby preventing attacks of serious disease. The ratio per cent. of sick to strength has been 4.10 for the past year. There is no Hospital Assistant attached to this asylum, and I am still of opinion that such a medical subordinate is necessary for the proper care of the lunatics confined here. JOHN N. TRESIDDER, Dy. Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, Umballa Circle.

The manufactures have been a little more profitable than formerly, Rs. 126 having been credited to Government. Establishment. 8. Two important changes have been made in the establishment during the past year in the appointment of an Assistant Surgeon to the Deputy Superin- tendentship of the Asylum and of an English writer. In 1872, when Mr. Glegg resigned, the Lieutenant-Governor expressed his approval of the principle of sup- plying his place with an Assistant Surgeon; but there was no one available at the time. A pensioned Apothecary was therefore appointed, who remained in the post till August 15th last, when Assistant Surgeon Taboo Singh was nominated on a salary of Rs. 120 a month. He joined on 10th September. The English writer was rendered necessary by the numerous English returns and exten- sive English correspondence required in the asylum. He joined on 1st March, and his pay (Rs. 50) was arranged without any increase to the allowance sanctioned for establishment. An addition of Rs. 10 has been made to the pay of Mrs. Sinnott, the matron, as a reward for long and diligent service. She now receives Rs. 40 a month. Post-mortem room. 9. One of the advantages accruing from the appointment of an intelligent Assistant Surgeon to the post of Deputy Superintendent will be the opportunity of making some pathological investigations into the causes of insanity by means of post-mortem examinations. I have always regretted the absence of means for doing this. The defect will now be remedied, as Government has sanctioned the building of a post-mortem room, which I hope will be completed in 1875. Health of the institu- tion. 10. This has been remarkably good, as the Return of Sick (No. 8) shows the deaths having been only 28, or 11.2 per cent. of the daily average strength. It is remarkable that only 3 cases died of fever and 2 of debility, whereas the numbers in 1873 were 4 and 16 respectively ; the cases of debility being, as was pointed out in paragraph 5 of the report of that year, mostly old chronic cases of intermittent fever. Fourteen of the deaths were due to diarrh( 23 ) No. 1.( 24 ) No. Statement showing the Admissions, Discharges, &c., &c., of Lunatics in the 1 2 3 4 5 YEARS. Remained on 1st January. Admitted.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB For the Year 1875. DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM. No. 57, dated 23rd February 1876. From( 2 ) The health of the lunatics has, on the whole, been good, and although cholera pro- General health. vailed in the city and neighborhood of the asylum from the begin- ning of May to the end of November, no case occurred in it. 5. The number of criminal lunatics, which had increased to 7 on 1st January 1875 and was augmented by 2 more admissions during the year, has been Criminal luuatic3. _ .&deg; . ,, , ,. . n . . . , J reduced to 6 by the death of 3 of them in the course of the year* One of these criminal lunatics, by name Ashraff Khan,* who has been confined in this asylum for several years, and who was reported as &quot; apparently sane &quot; in the report for 1873, made a sudden and murderous assault with a stick on several of the keepers in July last, and was with difficulty overpowered. He broke the jemadar's finger, besides severely bruising him in other parts, and he also injured a keeper. This man had several times threatened to take the life of some one if he was not released, and since this outbreak I have been obliged to keep him locked up for security. He does not appear insane, but is a man of ungovernable temper. 6. Of the 42 lunatics admitted during the year, 20 were Caste of lunatics. Muhammadans, 15 Hindus, 1 Christian, and 6 other castes. Sex of lunatics; Thirty-four were males and 8 females. 7. The types of insanity were as follows :37 acute mania, 28 chronic mania, Types of insanity. 3 melancholia, 10 acute dementia, 21 chronic dementia, 1 idiotcy, and 4 epilepsy. 8. The alleged causes of insanity were 46 physical, 27 moral, and 31 unknown. Of the former 24 were stated to be due to indulgence in intoxicating spirits or drugs, and 22 to fever or heat; while of the latter, grief was by far the most common cause. But little trust is to be attached to these distinctions, for in the majority of instances the information regarding lunatics is filled up in a very perfunctory manner. 9. The cost per head of the lunatics for the year amounts to Ks. 101-9-7; last year it amounted to Rs. 100-10-0 ; but there was an error in the calculation Cost per head. for that year and the cost ought really to have been Rs. 109-3-5, so that there is actually a decrease of Rs. 7-9-10 in the cost per head this year. 10. Few changes have taken place in the asylum buildings. The cells used for the confinement of violent lunatics were found totally inadequate for the Asylum buildings. purpose. One man twice wrenched the iron bars out of the doors and effected his escape into the courtyard, another managed to scramble to the ventilator in the roof and forced his way through and so got out. An application was at once made to Government to have five cells made of sufficient strength to secure the most violent lunatics, and these are now in course of erection on the ruins of some which fell down during the extraordinary heavy rainfall of 8th and 9th September Several of the latrines which had no ventilation but by the door have had large openings made in them so as to allow of free perflation of air. 11. Little treatment of a medical kind has been attempted except in cases of groat Treatment and manage- excitement, when the warm bath with cold douche to the head has *n&deg;nt. beon found useful, or occasionally a dose of chloral hydrat, or a blister to tho back of the head. No mechanical restraint has boon found necessary; but when lunatics known to be dangerous show symptoms of excitement they are locked up for safety for a few hours or days according to necessity. Every inducement is given to tho lunatics to amuse themselves in any way they can, and for this purpose kitos, toys, tom-toms, sittars, &c, are provided for those who caro for them. Tho women have pet pigoous, rabbits, and lambs : swings are also erected for their amusement. * 1 have soon this man several timos.

( 3 ) On Sundays all are treated to either sweetmeats, or fruits in their season. This treat is looked forward to by them, and in cases of misbehaviour it is withheld as a means of punish- ment. The lunatics are freely indulged in tobacco at certain hours daily, and their friends are permitted to visit them as often as they wish. On the whole they seem as happy as their miserable state will allow. Occupation. 12. No manufactures have been attempted, but the males have been employed in garden- ing, in keeping the ridges and walks neat and trim, and in any other light labour they could be induced to turn their hands to. The women do a little spinning of cotton thread, &c. Rs. 61-1-4 have been credited to Government on account of grass, vegetables, pigeons, and rabbits sold. Diet. 13. Owing to the urgent representation of the late Superintendent the scale of diet for females has been increased from 8 to 10 chittaks of wheat, or the same as the men. The food is examined daily at my morning visit ; it is of excellent quality, and as a rule is very well cooked. Garden. 14. The garden has supplied a liberal allowance of vegetables throughout the year; and a few rupees have been realized by sale of the surplus. Conservancy. 15. Cleanliness and conservancy are fairly looked after. Of course it is impossible that these should be so rigidly attended to as in a jail, owing to the extremely filthy and irregular habits of many of the lunatics; but as far as possible both barracks and latrines are kept clean and free from smell. Establishment. 16. Mr. Cousins and his wife have occupied the posts of deputy superintendent and matron during the year. On the whole they have conducted the duties to my satisfaction, but Mrs. Cousins is often ill herself and unable to give that constant attention to her work which is so necessary. Their pay, which was for- merly Rs. 25 and 7 a month, was much too low considering the nature of their duties, and has during the year been increased to Rs. 50 and 20. It is to be hoped this will stimulate them to increased exertions both in attending to the welfare of the lunatics and in keeping down unnecessary expense. The jemadár continues to give satisfaction. Having a slight know- ledge of medicine, he is able to bring to notice incipient illness among the lunatics; but a more qualified man than he is necessary, now that the number of lunatics confined in this asylum has increased so much. The native doctor of the jail has hitherto looked after the medical treatment of the sick in hospital without receiving any additional remuneration for so doing. If a small allowance was to be made to him monthly, it would be an inducement for him to look better after the welfare of the lunatics. I regret I cannot report favorably about the subordinate establishment. The assistant matron, the cook, and a keeper have been discharged for stealing the lunatics' food, and several of the burkandázes and keepers have been fined or dismissed for carelessness or harsh treatment of the lunatics under their charge.

The whole of the latrines have been fitted with raised earthen chabútras, which ad- mit of being easily removed and relaid ; they prevent the possibility of the floors sinking into hollows and give a much tidier appearance. Conservancy. 11. All ordure, except that from the hospital, is buried in shallow trenches in the garden, and, so far as absolute cleanliness could be preserved, every effort has been made,( 18 ) Employment. 20. Gardening is the one chief occupation. There are three or four rooms for weaving common cloth, but all attempt to increase labor in this direction in- volves too much loss to Government. The barracks and grounds are so extensive, the amount of " leeping," and sweeping, and conservancy so constantly carried on, that all who can work are obliged to help. The women spin cotton. Money credited to Gov- ernment. 21. There was a sum of Rs. 202-15-10 credited to Government on account of the value of vegetables consumed by the lunatics, and there was a further sum of Rs. 30 on account of a paying patient. Manufacture. 22. There has been a very slight increase in the profit, viz., Rs. 50, entirely from the few looms, and a little moonj, string-making and spinning. Establishment. 23. No change has taken place in the establishment during the year in the strength, but I have weeded out a number of useless, idle warders. Jamadár Mirza Hassan Ali (brother of the late most respected Native Doctor, Mirza Kudrat Ali, who was well known to me) has given me great satisfaction both in his ordinary duties and the troublesome one of removing the lunatics into camp during the epidemic of cholera. Native Doctor Syad Ahmed Shah is very kind to the lunatics, sick or well; he also had a very hard time of it during cholera. Health of the institution. 24. All went well till the end of August. There were only 16 deaths up to that time. and it seemed as if we were to escape even ague. On the 1st of September, like a sudden clap of thunder, a case of unmistakable cholera occurred in the Asylum. Cholera. Total number and time of occurrence. 25.

( 20 ) Cases in Lunatic Asylum. In the Lunatic Asylum, between the 1st September and the 9th October, there were 27 cases and 19 deaths out of a strength of 260 luna- tics and 32 warders. Removal to camp. It was first entirely confined to the harmless lunatics, who were removed to the tomb of Ali Mardán Khan, near the village of Chintghars about two miles on the Amritsar road. On the 3rd October not a single case occurred after the removal of the 175 harmless lunatics. Between the 3rd and 9th, 4 cases occurred in the dangerous lunatics, who had been left behind in the Asylum; they were promptly removed to another tomb near Chintghar, and the disease ceased. Females escaped. The females who were left behind escaped altogether, excepting one very doubtful case; and there was no case amongst the establishment. Measures adopted. A careful investigation was made as to the quality of the food or water. The well was changed, all the old filters destroyed, and the water boiled and filtered, The whole of the Asylum was renovated, floors dug up, chabútra removed, and the whole of the wards thoroughly fumigated; but in vain : there was no al- ternative but flight. Where cholera most pre- vailed. Between the Lunatic Asylum and the city walls is the Lunda Bazár and the two Rail- way stations, where large numbers of travellers congregate. There were certainly worse cases, and they were more frequent in this por- tion of Lahore than elsewhere: 32 cases occurred in this section, known as No. 9. There are many places of accommodation for travellers. Medical assistance. To Tabu Singh, the Assistant Surgeon at the Lunatic Asylum, great praise should be given for his admirable arrangements during a very trying time. Résumé of arrangements. In the Lunatic Asylum the first case occurred on the 1st of September; then it remained dormant till the 18th, when another case occurred. It was not till the 26th that it broke out with severity. Fearfully heavy rains had fallen and flooded the country. The first removal was on the 3rd October. The weather be- coming cold and there having been a thorough cleaning up of the Asylum, I brought the lunatics back. The harmless ones returned on the 25th October, and the criminal and danger- ous on the 6th November, since which time the health of the lunatics has been uninterrupt- edly good. Conclusion. In conclusion, I may remark that in Assistant Surgeon Tabu Singh we have one of the best selected men for the post of Deputy Superintendent in intellect, kindness of disposition, and last, not least, in physique. Mrs. Sinnott, Matron over the female lunatics, has given me entire satisfaction, and has assisted both Tabu Singh and myself in a most cordial manner. Her quarters are not very comfortable, and I have promised to do my utmost with the visitors to secure her better. The visitors of the Asylum have inspected the Asylum four times during the past year.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB For the Year 1876. No. 558, dated 21st March 1877. From( 2 ) Paying patients. 7. Paying patients are a new source of revenue, though, I fear, much money can never be realised in this way in the Punjab. A prisoner, acquitted of murder on the ground of insanity in 1874, being a pensioner of Government, was our first paying patient. The deduction was made from his pension by order of the Commissioner. Since then, it having been discovered that the husband of a Eurasian lunatic woman, admitted as a pauper, was employed on the Northern State Railway, application was made for payment, and he paid regularly Rs. 10 a month for her keep, from August 1875 up to July 1876. Since this he has paid nothing, although he has been reminded. Further inquiry will be made about this. The Deputy Commissioner of Lahore has also paid Rs. 5 for a lunatic named Jewan, and Rs. 20 for another named Fattah. Manufactures. 8. The net profit from this source has amounted to only Rs. 70-6-5, of which Rs. 50 has been credited to Government, as shown in the above table; Rs. 45-8-7 has been reserved for the purchase of raw material. This includes a balance in hand from last year of Rs. 24-0-11. The manufactures have always been a difficulty in this Asylum. In 1871 they were a little more profitable, but the cholera and fever of 1872 swept off some of our most skillful workmen, whom years of labor and per- severance on the part of the Native Doctor, named Mirza Koodrat Ali, who had been in the Asylum from its commencement, had succeeded in teaching a little handicraft. Then the Native Doctor himself died, and nobody since has succeeded very well, for nobody in the establishment knew the work as well as he did. Darries, gárhá cloth, blankets, niwár and reed chiks, however, are still made ; but the whole thing is at a very low ebb, as is evident from the small sum credited to Government. I see that there has been a correspondence on this subject during the past year : the profitable labor of the Dullunda Asylum has been pointed out, and the reports have been supplied to us, in order that we may learn the secret of its pecuniary prosperity. A glance at the report is sufficient. There is a permanent establishment of instructors costing Rs. 179 a month, and machinery valued at Rs. 27,329. The only instructor we have at Lahore is a warder who receives Re. 1 a month in addition to his regular pay of Rs. 7. It is true we have a tailor on Rs. 7, a mállí on Rs. 8, and assistant mállí on Rs. 6 ; but they are not entertained as instructors, and are fully employed in their own work. Our machinery is valued at Rs. 31. If a good staff of instructors and good machinery were supplied us, I doubt not that in time we should succeed as well as the Dullunda Asylum. One great obstacle to making the manufactures remunerative is the difficulty of selling things when ready. This is partly due to the situation of the Asylum, at the extreme end of the station beyond the railway. Nobody, of course, comes out here to buy when he can purchase as cheaply nearer home. There is one thing of which we may be said to have a monopoly, viz., syphon filters of the kind used within the Asylum ; but the demand for these outside is so small that they are scarcely at all profitable. Again, since I took charge of the Asylum in 1871, we have had no less than four Deputy Superintendents, so that not one of them has had time to work up the manufactures. The present Deputy Superintendent, Abdul Hámid, takes a great interest in them, and has succeeded in making some good blankets, which will be very useful in the Asylum. I am very strongly of opinion that the best plan to make the manu- factures remunerative is to devote our attention exclusively to those things that can be turned to account within the institution. Establishment. 9. This remains the same as regards numbers and expenditure. Dr. Penny held charge till December 8th, when I returned from England and relieved him. Assistant Surgeon Taboo Singh was removed on 20th Septem- ber, and his place supplied by Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hámid.
( 3 ) Pathological investiga- tions. 10. In my report for 1874, I stated that a post-mortem room had been commenced. This has since been completed, and a post-mortem examination is now made of every patient that dies in the Asylum, unless the friends object. Thirty-four such examinations have been made during the past year. An annual report is not the place to record pathological appearances, nor have the investigations yet been numerous enough for a special report ; but there is no doubt that as the records accumulate during the next few years, they will become exceedingly valuable, and throw light upon a branch of medical science heretofore too little studied. Health. 11. This seems to have been fairly good. There has been no cholera, and the deaths have been 46, or 17.6 per cent, of the daily average strength. The deaths from diarrh( 4 ) No. 1.

( 17 ) DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM. No. 54, dated 24th March 1877. From( 18 ) Ashraff Khán, the criminal lunatic, who was reported last year as having attacked and severely injured the jamadár, and to have been locked up ever since for security, has been gradually restored to his liberty, and now he goes about free and unrestrained among the other lunatics. He has even within the last few weeks been made to consider himself a kind of Assistant-keeper, and has helped to keep order among the lunatics. He is a man, however, who requires constant watching. On one occasion, in the hot weather, he refused to leave his sleeping ward until he had seen me, and I found the reason was that he thought he had been cheated of his proper quantity of food by the jamadár, whom he still looks upon as his enemy, and who he believes wishes to kill him. He first asked me the weight of the bread and dál which he ought to get, and on being told this he brought out the whole of his previous day's rations, which he had hidden away in a corner untouched, and he requested that it might be weighed there and then. Fortunately both the bread and the dál, although they had been kept so long, were rather over the prescribed weight. He was a little crestfallen at the result, but apparently satisfied, and I have heard no more complaints since. I mention the circumstance to show what unfounded suspicions occasionally come across the man's mind; and during these there can be no doubt that he is prepared for any deed of violence, for, while questioning me about his rations, his whole manner was most excited. Caste of lunatics. 5. Of the 30 lunatics admitted during the year, 7 were Hindus, 17 Muhammadans, and 6 belonged to other castes. Sex of lunatics. 6. Twenty-six of the number were males and 4 females. Types of insanity. 7. The types of insanity were as follows :( 19 ) idle who can be induced to work. The introduction of healthful employment for the lunatics is the most pleasant feature about the management of the Asylum during the year. The out-turn from the manufactures has certainly not been great; but this can only be looked upon as a secondary consideration, and next year will probably show a better return in this respect, But while work has been introduced, amusements have not been neglected. When relieved from their work, which they are frequently, so as not to tire them with it, they are allowed to lounge about and to smoke or amuse themselves in any way they like. Those who are musically inclined have tomtoms and sitárs given to them ; and one old blind man, with rather an abusive tongue unfortunately, enlivens the others at their work with his singing and his accom- paniment on an old tin dish. On Sundays and some other holidays they are treated with sweetmeats, oranges, and other fruits in their season. Diet. 12. No change has taken place in the dietary during the year. The food is daily examined by me, and is generally of good quality; but the cooking is often bad, and the two daily meals are not served out with the regularity that could be wished. The cooks have given much trouble during the year. Their duties in a Lunatic Asylum are not very pleasant, and their pay (only Rs. 5 a month) is not so very tempting as to make them dread dismissal. When reprimanded, therefore, or fined for neglect, they frequently take French leave, and then it is most difficult to get their places supplied. Garden. 13. The garden has not been well kept during the year. There has been as much trouble with the málís as with the cooks, for their pay is too small to secure the services of good men. The garden has, however, supplied all the vegetables required for the Asylum. Establishment. 14. Mr. Cousins and his wife have continued as Deputy Superintendent and Matron during the year, but the latter was obliged to take six months' sick leave from 1st September 1876. During her absence Mrs. Smith officiated as Matron. I regret that I cannot report so favorably on Mr. Cousins as I could have wished. He has not given me that support which I should have looked for in intro- ducing manufactures into the Asylum, and he has shown a want of tact in dealing with the ser- vants under him. Among the subordinate establishment the jamadár, Pír Baksh, deserves praise for the way in which he has looked after the welfare of the lunatics; but there is not much to be said about the barkandázes and keepers, who, from the smallness of their pay, are generally men who have failed to get employment elsewhere. The Native Doctor of the jail has continued to look after the sick in hospital without receiving any remuneration for his trouble. A proposal was forwarded through the Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner to the Punjab Government that Rs. 5 a month should be allowed to the Native Doctor for his attendance on the lunatics, and although it received the sanction of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, this had afterwards to be cancelled, as it is laid down that Hospital Assistants are " not ordinarily entitled to more than the pay of their grade," Visitors. 15. The visitors have held 7 meetings at the Asylum during the year.

No. 3464. FROM LEPEL GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Officiating Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, To COLONEL C. H. HALL, Commissioner and Superintendent, Lahore Division. Dated Lahore, 3rd September 1877. Home. SIR, I AM directed to acknowledge the Annual Report of the Lahore Luna- tic Asylum for the year 1876. The Lieutenant-Governor observes that although there was no cholera in the institution during the year, yet that the number of deaths have been 46, or 17.6 per cent. of the daily average strength, which is nearly as high as the past year, during which there was a severe epidemic of cholera. The year was, however, exceedingly unhealthy; and the percentage of deaths among the inmates of the Lahore Lunatic Asylum has only on two occasions, viz., in 1871 and 1874, fallen below a percentage of 17 per cent. ; and it is an ascertained fact that the mortality among the insane population is pro- portionally far greater under similar circumstances than that of the sane population. 2. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to see that the system of making those who are able to bear the expense pay for the maintenance of their insane relations in the Asylum has been instituted. 3. With reference to the remarks of the Superintendent on the subject of manufactures, His Honor does not anticipate any profit from the work of the lunatics ; but he is glad to see attention paid to the subject, as there is no reason that the flour required for the use of the institution should not be ground within the walls, and that the coarse blanketing and cloth for the dress of the lunatics should not be made by themselves. Sufficient occupation is one of the best means of improving their mental condition. I have, &c., LEPEL GRIFFIN, Officiating Secretary to Government, Punjab.

No. 3465. FROM LEPEL GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Officiating Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, To LIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. G. DAVIES, Commissioner and Supermtendent, Delhi Division. Dated Lahore, 3rd September 1877. Home. SIR, THE Lieutenant-Governor has read the Report on the Delhi Lunatic Asylum for 1876, forwarded with your No. 54, of the 24th March, with much interest, and notes with satisfaction that the number of men discharged cured is very much higher than during last year. This result may fairly be attributed to the great care taken by the Superintendent in the treatment and management of lunatics and providing them with both work and recreation.

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN THE PUNJAB For the Year 1877. No. 592, dated Lahore, 25th March 1878. From( 2 ) Ali Mardan died last month, but the Assistant Commissioner of Hazára, who sent him here, said that his friends would pay. When he had been here six months the bill was enclosed to the Assistant Commissioner (on 15th April last), but no reply has yet been received. A reminder will now be sent. 2. The question of reducing the increased establishment alluded to in paragraph 5 of the Secretary's letter was dealt with in this office No. 12, of 4th February last, in which I pointed out that I considered it undesirable to diminish it, unless the number of male lunatics fell to 200. As the lunatics are now much more employed than formerly, and some of the dangerous characters are brought out of their special ward to the work-shed, a good deal more supervision is required. I would further point out that when the increase was first made as a temporary arrangement on 1st August 1877 the number of lunatics was 285 ; that it was then rapidly increasing, and on September 18th reached its maximum 292; that in November 1877 when application was made for the increase to be sanctioned as a permanent arrangement, the average of the previous month, October, had been 283. The average has now fallen to 271 in April. So small a reduction as this does not enable us to guard one ward less, so that I am still of opinion that any diminution of establishment would be unsafe. 3. As regards the statement that the food of the lunatics was " fairly good," I did not desire to draw any comparison with the food of the jails, but simply to imply that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, a fair value was received for the money expended on the provi- sions. On now comparing our scale of diet with that of the jails, I find an immense superiority in that of the Asylum, and the object we keep steadily in view is to obtain the best quality procurable for the price. Annual Report of 1877, by Surgeon-Major J. B. Scriven, Superintendent Lahore Lunatic Asylum. THERE is not much that is new to relate about this Asylum. The principal points of interest are the employment of lunatics, the manufacturing industry, and the increase in the number of inmates. In this report I shall observe, as nearly as possible, the order of former years, as a comparison with the past will thus most readily be made. Buildings. 2. There has been no addition to these. The shed proposed by Dr. Penny for the dangerous lunatics was refused, on the ground that no money was available, and that its necessity had not been shown. I prefer postponing for the present the consideration of its necessity, as from the increased employment of the lunatics, some new building will probably be required, but of what kind is as yet not quite clear. Sanitary arrangements. 3. These have not boon altered, I see that in the report for 1875, it was stated that all the night-soil, except that of the hospital, was buried in the garden in shallow trenches; this exception was made, because it was considered by the Superintendent inexpedient to bury the ordure from sick men in the garden, and it was therefore carried to a distance. Possibly his reason was that cholera was prevalent in 1875, but the plan was only adopted for a short time; the whole is now buried; a trench 12 inches deep by 12 wide and 6 feet long contains the whole 24 hours' refuse of the 280 inmates. This plan has now been adopted for 6 years; the soil of the garden has become very rich in consequence, and there is never any offensive smell. Originally my instructions were to dig the trenches 18 inches deep; but we found the country ploughs did not go so deep as this, and that 12 inches answered better. Plots of ground are set apart in succession for the deposit of manure. When a plot has been filled, it is allowed to lie fallow for at least one month and a half from the time of the last deposit; then it is ploughed and cultivated. After one crop has been grown upon it, it is ready to be used again; but often we grow two or three crops before again using it for manure. It was with a view of getting plenty of room for dis- posing of the manure, as well us of getting rid of a nuisance, that the objectionable piece of hollow ground mentioned in paragraph 13 of the report of 1875 was taken up; it was lying waste at the time, and we paid nothing for it; its cultivation has greatly improved the neighbourhood, for even up to the present year it was hollow and swampy, but it has now been almost completely filled up, and this of course has been done by lunatic labour. Forms and causes of Insanity. 4. I have no new remarks to make under this head. Class of persons admitted. 5. Ninety males, 11 females,( 3 ) Money credited to Government. 6. The following sums have been paid into the treasury :( 4 ) organization of a manufacturing industry in a Lunatic Asylum is necessarily a slow process, for many lunatics are with great difficulty induced to work; when so induced they are often very hard to teach, and, unless constantly watched, idle away a great part of their time. Be- sides this, when a lunatic who has been taught becomes sane, he is, like all others that recover, discharged; and it often happens that a man cannot be taught till he begins to recover, so skill- ed labour only lasts during his convalescence, which may be a very short period. Grinding corn. 10. One decided improvement in the employment of lunatics, suggested by His Honor's remarks on the Report of 1876, is making them grind their own corn. We were obliged to send to Amritsar for mill- stones, and when they were procured, had some difficulty in getting them properly cut. In December, however, the grinding was commenced on eight stones worked by sixteen men. As this was effected so late in the year, it makes but little show in the daily average number of men employed ;* but I hope during 1878 we shall make the lunatics grind all the corn used in the institution. Food. 11. The food of the inmates is fairly good. Vegetables are supplied as far as possible from the Asylum garden, and are therefore the product of lunatic labour; but in consequence of the drought last year, and of some mismanagement on the part of the gardener, we had less than usual. Meat used to be supplied thrice in a week, ½lb each time, but now half the quantity is supplied six times, or every working day. The cooking also is tolerable. Good milk is provided every day for the sick from cows brought to the Asylum and milked at the gate. In consideration of this, we get 1½ seer less per rupee than the market rate. Drinking water. 12. The process of filtration of drinking water is the same as described in my report of 1871; the filters answer well. The water however is not brought from the same well as formerly, as this well be- came contaminated in some way. Health. 13. This has been pretty good. The mortality has been 13.9 per cent of strength, but a large proportion of it has been furnished by cases of epilepsy, phthisis pulmonalis, and dropsy, which are scarcely curable diseases.

( 15 ) No. 1783, dated Lahore, 29th April 1878. From( 16 ) It appears from this that the larger number of inmates in 1877 was not due to the admissions of that year, but to the increase in the number admitted during the previous year, and to the comparatively few discharges within the same period, which was the cause of an unusually heavy balance being brought forward at the commencement of 1877. The total of that year, after taking in the admissions, was only 1 in excess of 1875, and 12 in excess of 1876 ; while at the close of the year the number had fallen to 7 below that of 1876. It will be seen that the admissions during the last year were fewer, and the discharges more numerous, than in the previous year, so that any strain there may have been on the establishment owing to the number of patients was apparently diminishing when the increase to the staff of the institution took place ; and thus the grounds set forth by the Superintendent do not seem sufficient to justify the additional expense incurred on establishments during the past year. 6. The year was remarkably healthy, and the percentage of deaths fell from 17.6 in 1876, and 20.5 in 1875, to 13.9 ; and Mr. Egerton directs me to express his recognition of the care and attention Dr. Scriven has shown in the superintendence of this institution during the year under report. No. 53, dated Delhi, 28th February 1878. From(17) Deaths. 4. Only 4 deaths occurred during the year ; 1 from remittant fever, 2 from pneumonia and 1 from accidental drowning. A full inquiry into the circumstances attending the last-mentioned death was made by the Deputy Commissioner at my request, and, although the Overseer was severely censured for his apparent endeavour in the first instance to conceal the real cause of death, nothing came out to give rise to the suspicion that it was anything but purely accidental. It occurred at a time when the warders were much too few for the number of lunatics, and before the recent augmentation was sanctioned. The man was an epileptic, who, when the evening meal was being served out, managed to slip away unperceived, and some time elapsed before he was missed. When search was made for him, his body was found in the bathing tank in the garden, and it is supposed that, having gone there to wash himself, he was seized with a fit and fell in. Rate of mortality. 5. The death-rate calculated on the daily average number of lunatics only amounts to 4.75, and is, with the single exception of 1868, when the asy- lum population was not half what it is now, the smallest mortality which has occurred during the 11 years of which records are to be found, and is little more than a third of the average death-rate for that period. General health of lunatics. 6. This favourable result may be partly due to the element of chance, and it is certainly greatly owing to the very healthy character of the year ; but something may also fairly be attributed to the more scru- pulous attention to everything bearing on the health of the lunatics, including their regular occu- pation and amusement. Looking at the comparatively large average number of sick in hospi- tal, it might be supposed that the general health of the asylum had been worse than in former years, but this is by no means the case : on the contrary, it has been exceptionally good, ( 18 ) Sex of lunatics. 11. Fifty-nine of the lunatics admitted and re-admit- ted were males, and only 6 were females; all of whom were Muhammadans. Types of insanity. 12. The types of insanity in the 140 lunatics who formed the population of the asylum during the year were as follows:( 19 ) No. 1.

No. 464, dated 14th March 1879. From( 2 ) ing away and burying offal, bringing in fresh earth, breaking bricks and mending roads in the Asylum. The value of lunatics' labour, calculated at one anna a day per man, has been Rs. 3,061-14-0. This therefore is the estimated saving to Government effected by employing the inmates of the Asylum instead of hired servants. Skilled labour. 9. During 1878, 20.9 men and 13.4 women, on an average, have been employed in skilled labour. The women's work has been spinning. We have twelve spinning wheels, by means of which 4 maunds 3 seers 9¼ chittaks of raw cotton has been spun, and 3 maunds 27 seers 10 chittaks of thread has been the result. Of this 1 maund 9 seers 6 chittaks has been woven into various fabrics by the male lunatics, 1 maund 30 seers has been sold, and the rest, 28 seers 4 chittaks, remains in store. The men have been employed in making the things mentioned in the following table, which also shows the quantities of these articles manufactured, and the account to which they have been turned : ARTICLES.

Our attention is principally directed to making blankets, gárha cloth, pilchi baskets and twine, as these things can be for the most part applied to the Asylum use. The sum of Rs. 789-11-11 has been realised by sale of the manufactured articles, the net profit being Rs. 301-11-4, a portion of them also remains in store valued at Rs. 53-8-2. Grinding corn. 10. We have now 18 millstones, worked by 36 men, who grind on an average 5 seers each per diem, Sundays excepted. This, however, has not been done during the whole of the past year, as, at its commencement, all the millstones were not ready. The men grind from 7 A. M. to 2 P. M. This is hard work for lunatics, who are quite unable to do the same amount as healthy persons, but they grind all the corn consumed in the Asylum during the six working days of the week. Food. 11. The lunatics have been well fed. The food has been much more expensive than the jail food, as meat is supplied in small quantity every work- ing day. We calculated some months ago that if the meat were cut out the food would cost nearly the same as the jail food. Garden produce. 12. A fair amount of vegetables has been supplied from the Asylum garden. Drinking water. 13. As before. Health. 14. The mortality has been 13.8 per cent. of strength. This is less by 1 than in 1877, although 1877 was an exceptionally healthly year and 1878 an exceptionally bad one. Moreover, it is less than in any previous year of the present institution with the exception of 1870 and 1874. One of the deaths was a case of suicide. An examination has been lately made with a view to discover the number of lunatics suffering from enlarged spleen in order that they might be put at once under treatment. The number found was 41. It will be observed that only two deaths have occurred from the prevailing malady of the year, malarious fever. Establishment. 15. The permanent establishment has not been altered. Extra hands were required, as mentioned in paragraph 2, when the wall was in building also one man to supply the place of a warder who had his arm broken by a lunatic ; and a Native Doctor was employed for two months in place of Syad Ahmed Shah, who was ill from a dissection wound produced in the execution of his duty at a post mortem examination. The establishment have on the whole done their work satisfacto- rily, but there have been a few breaches of discipline, in consequence of which some heavy lines and summary dismissals have been necessary. Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hámid, the Deputy Superintendent, has worked very hard, and I think, successfully, in the management of the institution, as the small mortality, the increased employment of lunatics, and the larger sums of money credited to Government, sufficiently testify. * During the present year, 1879, we hope that by improved arrangement the corn for Sundays will also be ground in the Asylum.

Superintendent, Lunatic Asylum. Printed at the Punjab Government Civil Secretariat Press, Lahore.No. 2644. FROM LEPEL GRIFFIN, ESQUIRE, Secretary to Government, Punjab and its Dependencies, To J. W. SMYTH, ESQUIRE, Offg. Commissioner and Superintendent, Lahore Division. Dated Lahore, 19th July 1879. Home. SIR, I AM desired to acknowledge the receipt, under your docket No. 464, dated 14th March, of the Report on the Lunatic Asylum, Lahore, for the year 1878, which is on the whole favorable. It is satisfactory to observe that more attention has been paid to the employment of the patients, and that efforts have been made to render the Asylum more self-supporting than formerly. Sale of garden produce and old stores ... Rs. As. P. 454 15 8 Realized from labor ... 541 9 6 Paying patients ... 154 3 10 Total ... 1,150 13 0 2. It appears from para. 6 of the report that a sum of Rs. 1,150-13-0, realized as noted in the margin, has been paid into the treasury, against Rs. 240-8-5 in the previous year; while in para. 9 it is shown that Rs. 789-11-11 had been realized by the sale of manufactured articles, but whether in addition to the above or included in it is not shown. In Statement 11 the amount to the credit of the Asylum is given as follows:No, 539, dated 10th March 1879. From( 2 ) 2. There were 90 patients in the asylum at the close of the year, thesame as in the previ- ousyear, but the average number in the asylum during the year was higher than last year, being 97 to 84. The total number of admissions was 55 and the number of patients for treat- ment during the year was 145. Of these 21 were discharged cured, and 7 made over to their friends improved in health. The number of criminal lunatics has increased from 14 to 16. 3. During the last four months of the year the city of Delhi has suffered severely from an outbreak of fever, and the asylum has not escaped. Patients, warders, and the Overseer himself, all alike have suffered, and the mortality has consequently been higher than usual. The two cases of cholera appear to have been sporadic. They occurred one in August and the other in September. 4. The profits derived from the labor of the inmates has increased from Rs. 1,614-4-0 to Rs. 421-15-11. This probably includes the value of the waste land reclaimed, which Dr.. Fairweather estimates at Rs. 250, an estimate which appears somewhat high. This work, however, is very useful, furnishing healthy occupation to the patients, and the fact that the lunatics can be induced to engage in such work, and carry it on with such useful results, is very creditable to the management. 5. Rupees 36-1-6 has been realized from the friends of those lunatics able to assist in their maintenance; the sum is not large, but a beginning has been made, and this is satisfactory. 6. The system adopted by Dr. Fairweather of laying down soft loose earth in the cells and earthen beds has been successful in keeping the cells and dormitories free from unpleasant odours. Some of the lunatics are very filthy in their habits, and the usual system of leeping the wards daily has been insufficient. 7. The lunatics are allowed as much liberty as is compatible with their own safety and that of the establishment. This no doubt considerably facilitates their recovery. 8. The conduct of the establishment is favorably reported on by the Superintendent, though the number of escapes which have occurred calls for increased vigilance on the part of the warders. The management of the asylum has been carefully supervised by Dr. Fairweather. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1878. SURGEON-MAJOR J. FAIRWEATHER, M. D., SUPERINTENDENT. Population. 1. ON 1st January 90 lunatics remained in the asylum from the previous year, 52 were admitted and 3 re-admitted during the year, making a total of 145, of whom 21 were discharged cured, 7 were transferred to friends improved, and 3 not improved in mental condition, 2 idiot boys were transferred to the poor-house as a more appropriate place for their detention, 1 lunatic escaped and has not been recaptured, 21 died, and 90 remained at the end of the year, the same num- ber as last year. Although the admissions have been 9 less than last year, the daily average number of lunatics has increased from 84 to 97. The proportion of cured to daily average strength as well as to admissions is considerably less than last year, but is fully equal to the average of 4 or 5 of the immediately preceding years. Mortality. 2. Of the 21 deaths 6 were from diarrh( 3 ) of the fever. Besides the general unhealthy character of the year there were also famine and cholera to add to its unhealthiness. A large proportion of the lunatics were in a very bad state of health on admission, and several of these died soon after they were brought in, but the mortality was by no means confined to the recent admissions, for some of the oldest and strong- est of the inhabitants of the asylum were carried off. Two isolated cases of cholera occurred in the asylum, one on the 21st August, and the other on the 26th September, both of which proved rapidly fatal, but fortunately the disease did not spread. Dropping cases of the disease had been occurring in the city the whole hot weather. Criminal lunatics. 3. The number of criminal lunatics in the asylum continues to increase; 14 remained from previous year, 6 were admitted, 4 were discharged or transferred, leaving 16 at the end of the year or 2 more than the previous year. Caste and sex of lunatics admitted. 4. Of the 55 new admissions 42 were Hindús and only 12 Muhammadans. Thirteen of the number were females, 8 of these being Hindús and 4 Muhammadans. Previous occupation of lunatics. 5. The largest number of lunatics admitted were either beggars, cultivators, laborers, servants, or shop-keepers, 3 were constables. Types of Insanity. 6. The types of insanity among the new admissions were( 4 ) to fatigue the lunatics too much and they were therefore frequently changed. The financial results of this work cannot well be shown, but it may be put down approximately as follows :( 5 ) No. 1.

No. 958, dated 2nd April 1880. From( 2 ) The first total, Rs. 1004-14-4, is included in column 7 of statement XI. The second total, Rs. 60-2-0, is shown in statement IX. The third total, Rs. 50-8-0, is not shown in any of the prescribed statements. Paying patients. 7. The sum of Rs. 60-2-0 given in the above table under this head is thus made up. Name of patient. District whence received. Amount received. REMARKS. Rs. A. P. Hira Singh ... Lahore ... 5 0 0 Dead. Narain Sukh, pensioned sepoy ... Dharmsala ... 24 0 0 Still in Asylum. Mrs. Thomas ... Lahore ... 8 1 0 Dead. Ahmed Din ... Lahore ... 23 1 0 Discharged. TOTAL ... 60 2 0 From this it will be seen that there is only one patient now in the Asylum for whom payment is received. Employment of lunatics in ordinary labour. 8. This has been much the same as in 1878 ; the daily average number of persons thus employed is 107.5 males and 10 females, total 117.5. The modes of employment have been as follows : leeping, sweeping, water carrying, cooking, mending clothes, carrying away and burying offal, bring- ing in fresh dry earth, breaking bricks and mending roads in the Asylum. The value of lunatics' labour, calculated at one anna a day per man, has been Rs. 2,298-9-0. This therefore is the estimated saving to Government effected by employing the inmates of the Asylum instead of hired servants. Skilled labour 9. During 1879, 21.2 men and 14 women, on an average, have been employed daily in skilled labour. The women have spun 3 maunds 31 seers 6 chittacks cotton, and 3 maunds 23 seers 10 chittacks thread has been the result. The men have been employed in making the things mentioned in the following table, which also shows the quantities of these articles manufactured, and the account to which they have been turned:( 3 ) Grinding corn. 10. We have had, as in 1878, 18 millstones worked by 36 men, who have ground on an average 6¾ seers each per diem. This is more than was done in 1878, but it is not the whole amount of the corn used in the Asylum, nor is it quite as much as ought to have been done. The work was interrupted only for nine days, in consequence of damage to the workshop by heavy rain in July. This accounts for a part of the deficiency. Food. 11. Nothing new. Garden produce. 12. Ditto. Drinking-water. 13. Ditto. Health. 14. The mortality has been rather heavy( 4 ) No. 1.

Lahore: PRINTED AT THE PUNJAB GOVERNMENT CIVIL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1830.
No. 626, dated Delhi, 22nd March 1880. From( 2 ) 6. The waste land to the south-east of the gate of the Asylum has now been almost entirely reclaimed, the crop raised off it realizing Rs. 44. The work of reclaiming this§ land appears to suit the lunatics and to be very beneficial to their health. 7. The management of the Asylum during the year has been very successful: several old and apparently incurable cases have yielded to Dr. FAIRWEATHER's cure and skill, and the mental condition of many others has improved. 8. The conduct of the establishment is favorably reported on by the Superintendent. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DELHI LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1879, BY SURGEON-MAJOR J. FAIRWEATHER, M. D., SUPERINTENDENT. Population. 1. Ninety lunatics remained from the previous year ; 26 were admitted, or only half the number of the preceding year ; 2 were re-admitted making a total of 118 for the year. Of these 20 were discharged cured, 6 were made over to their friends improved, and 1 not improved, 16 died, 2 escaped, and 73 remained at the end of the year. Recoveries. 2. The proportion of recoveries is satisfactory, and it is to be remarked that some : old unpromising chronic cases were among the number. One of these, a woman named Shahzadi, had been 8 years in the Asylum, and another, named Chandu, had been in for 6 years, both of them labouring under chronic mania. The old man Lachman, who used to entertain the other lunatics with his musical performances and his abusive tongue, and who had been 4 years in the Asylum, gradually calmed down, lost his taste both for music and abuse, and became quite sane. He was discharged on the 30th June 1879. General health and mortality. 3. Although the mortality has only been a little less than it was last year, it is some what remarkable that the lunatics have, on the whole, had better health and been less in hospital than they have been for several years past. This is seen by the daily average sick in hospital which is not half what it was last year. A glance at table No, 8 shows the reason of this, for while the admissions from malarious fevers were 130 in the previous year, they have only been 13 in this. The absence of these fevers also accounts for the comparative rarity of such diseases as anæmia, debility, diarrhoea and dysentery, which are generally the sequela of intermittent fevers. For this remarkable immunity from malarious fevers, I am unable to assign a proper cause, for the whole city and neighbourhood has suffered almost as severely from malarious fevers as they did the previous year: so much so indeed that the crops remained uncut in, many places by reason of the universal sickness. Moreover, the jail, which is close to the Asylum, and which uses the same well water, has had almost as heavy a sick list as, while it has had a far heavier mortality than, it had even the previous year. The health of the lunatics has not only differed from that of the prisoners by the almost complete immunity from malarious fevers, but by the total absence of the sloughing ulcers which have caused such a dreadful mortality in the jail. The only reason which can be assigned for this is that the lunatics are better fed than the prisoners. These sloughing ulcers have not been confined to the prisoners in jail, but have also been common among the free population ; they have, however, been observed to be confined almost entirely to the poor and unfed classes of the community. The cause of the heavy mortality among the lunatics, while at the same time their general, health was better than it had been for several years, is accounted for by the prevalence of peculiarly fatal forms of disease, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, meningitis, apoplexy dropsy, &c.
( 3 ) Criminal lunatics. 4. No criminal lunatics were admitted during the year, and of the 15 who remain from the previous year, 3 died, 1 escaped and was recap- tured, although he again escaped from the police guard who were bringing him back to the Asylum, 1 was discharged cured and sent to stand his trial, and 10 remained at the end of the year. Caste and sex of lunatics. 5. Of the 28 new admissions, 16 were Hindus, 9 Muhammadans, 3 other castes ; 23 were males and only 5 females. Types of insanity. 6. Five of those admitted were suffering under acute mania, 1 under chronic mania, 6 under melancholia, 2 under acute dementia, 5 under chronic dementia, 4 under monomania, and 5 were not insane. With regard to the latter a change in the way of returning them would seme to be necessary, for at present it is the custom in all Asylums to enter them among the cured, and this way the recoveries are erroneously magnified. In forms 1, 6 and 7 they should be shown under the head of "discharged otherwise," and not under the head of cured or recovered. Alleged causes of insanity. 7. The causes of insanity among the new admissions were put down as having been of a physical nature in 13, viz., 6 from the use of drugs or spirits 6 from fever or exposure to the sun, and 1 from epilepsy 8 were of a moral nature, viz., 6 from grief and 2 from fear ; and in 7 the causes were unknown. Cost per head 8. The cost per head of lunatics seems large when compared with last year viz. Rs. 103-15-11 against Rs. 89-2-10 ; but the difference is mainly caused by the greately reduced daily average strength of lunatics which necessarily raises the cost per head for permanent establishment. Recently the establishment has been reduced by the discharge of three keepers until the number of lunatics shall reach its former average. There has also been an increase in cost per head for diet, but this is entirely owing to the full market value of the vegetables supplied from the Asylum garden, for the use of the lunatics, having been charged this year for the first time. The increase of cost for clothing is explained by the fact that warm clothing had not to be pur- chased for the lunatics the previous year, as the old clothing of the year before was strong and good. Money realized from paying patients. 9. The amount of money realized on account of paying patients and credited to Govern- ment has been Rs. 69-13-0, and there is also a sum of Rs. 788 due by the Commissioner of Ajmere on account of lunatics sent by him for safe custody. This will shortly be realized. The cost of the remaining lunatics will be recovered by the Accountant-General from the different municipalities who forward lunatics to this Asylum, so that in reality the maintenance of the Asylum costs Government nothing but the outlay in keeping up the buildings. Very little expenditure on this head has been required during the year. Employments. 10. The lunatics have been employed in the same way as last year. Their heaviest piece of work has been reclaiming the waste land belong- ing to the Asylum. This was begun about two years ago, and two-thirds of the field have now been trenched to a depth of 3 feet ; and 2,360 cubic feet of large stones have been taken out of it during the year. Credit has only been taken for the value of the stones in the accounts, but the reclaimed land forms a valuable addition to the Asylum property and should be taken into consideration in estimating the value of the work done by the lunatics. The crop off this ground fetched Rs. 44 during the hot weather and it is now being planted with tobacco, which it is hoped will bring in a considerable sum. During the present year the whole of the field will probably be brought under cultivation. Care has been taken not to over-work the lunatics. Nearly all do a little work, but they are relieved when they get tired. A large quantity of "dosuti" and some blankets have been woven in the Asylum from thread spun by the women. All the wheat used in the Asylum has been ground by the lunatics, and there is plenty of light employment for them in keeping up the garden and grounds. Profits of labour. 11. Statement No, 11 professes to show the receipts and expenditure on account of manu- factures merely, but I have always been in the habit of including in it the results of the gardening operations and all kinds of work done by the lunatics which brings in money. The profit this year, as shown by this statement, amounts to Rs. 560-10-5, or Rs. 138-10-6 more than the previous year, and this is exclusive of the value of the reclaimed land, or of the labor of the lunatics in trenching it, Establishment. 12. Dr. Ferguson held charge of the Asylum for four months during my absence, partly, on duty and partly on leave. Mr. Cousins, the Overseer, although often suffering very much in health, has shown increasing interest in his work and deserves credit for his management. Native Doctor Saadat Ali has carefully watched the health of the lunatics and brought to notice anything which he thought might affect it injuriously The rest of the establishment have worked satisfactorily.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LAHORE LUNATIC ASYLUM FOR THE YEAR 1880, BY SURGEON- MAJOR J. B. SCRIVEN, SUPERINTENDENT. THE year 1880 has been a prosperous one as regards the Lunatic Asylum, and hence its annals are few. But, in recording them, I shall follow as nearly as possible the order of previous years. Buildings. 2. The verandah of the matron's house has been rebuilt, and also a shed used for the bullock ghary, in front of the asylum. The roofs of these were formerly of thatch, which had become very old, and as they were considered somewhat dangerous on account of fire, the new roofs have been constructed of tiling. A lattice-work has also been constructed around the asylum well, as, on more than one occasion, a lunatic has stealthily descended by the ladder into the well. Sanitary arrangements. 3. Nothing new to record. Forms and causes of insanity. 4. Nothing new. Class of persons admitted. 5. The admissions during the year were, males 55, females 10, total 65; of these 10 were criminal lunatics, 9 males and 1 female. Four of the sixty-five were re-admissions. Money credited to Government. 6. The following table shows the sums paid into the treasury, and the way in which they have been realized:( 2 ) per mensem. Considerable arrears thus became due and have since been realized. The whole amount is made up as follows:( 3 ) Rs. 39-0-11 in cash, and also manufactured goods and raw materials of the value of Rs. 82-8-4. This is shown in column 5 of Statement XI. Grinding corn. 10. The whole of the corn used in the asylum during 1880 was ground by the lunatics, with the exception of a small quantity in January. Food. 11. Nothing new. Garden produce. 12. Nothing new. Drinking water. 13. Nothing new. Health. 14. The number of deaths has been 17, or 6.8 per cent., which is less than in any previous year. Post-mortem examinations have been regularly made of those who have died. There has been no epidemic, and the year, having been a dry one, has been correspondingly healthy. A large pair of scales has been procured for weighing the inmates, and all of them are now weighed every month at the rate of about 10 persons per diem. Each particular ten have their weighing day, so that a monthly record is kept of each lunatic's weight at regular intervals of about 30 days. Establishment. 15. As I am about to leave Lahore, and this is the last report of the asylum that I shall have the opportunity of writing, I desire to record the high sense I entertain of the services rendered by the establishment, with whose help the institution has been immensely improved during the last ten years. First of these deservedly comes. Assistant Surgeon Abdul Hamid, who has been Deputy Superintendent for the last four years. Next to him Assistant Surgeon Tabu Singh, who held the appointment for two years before Abdul Hamid, and for three months in 1879, when Abdul Hamid was on leave. The improvements in the asylum, recorded in my previous reports, and the present one, have been mainly due to the energy and zeal of these two gentlemen. Next in order comes Babu Javand Lal, who perhaps has had the most difficult task of all, viz., that of reducing to order the confused pile of books and papers that existed before he came, as previously there was nobody here competent to keep an accurate account of any thing. I am now able to report the office in thorough order, which is mainly due to Javand Lal's diligence and attention to his work. The matron, Mrs. Sinnott, has been in her present post for 13 years, and has carefully attended to the well-being of the female inmates. The Deputy Superintendent has been ably assisted, for the last 8 years, by Hospital Assistant Syad Ahmed Shah, who has always been most assiduous in his attendance on the sick, and in supervising the diet and sanitation of the asylum. Not less to be commended are the jemadar, the compounder, and the jamadarni. The jemadar, Mirza Hussam Ali, has been here 13 years. He thoroughly understands the work of the institution, and we should have had great difficulty in carrying on the work without him. The compounder is also a most useful servant of Government, whom I have just recommended for an increase of pay. The jemadarni, Bassee, is the oldest servant in the institution, having served since the days of Ranjit Singh. She is now getting a little feeble, but her services are still too valuable to be dispensed with. Besides these, I must record my appreciation of the persevering labours of the three daf- fadars( 4 ) ANNUAL No. Showing the admissions, discharges, &c., &c., of Lunatics in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 YEARS.
