At Shillong there was no accommodation for in-patients during the year. New quarters with hospital accommodation have been provided, hut they were not completed before the close of the year. 31. There was an increase in the amount of fees received at Shillong and Silchar dispensaries. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. 32. Table VII shows the strength of the Subordinate Veterinary Establishment as it stood Assam on the 31st March 1912. At the beginning of the year there were two Inspectors and 24 Veterinary Assistants. Nine graduates of the Bengal Veterinary College joined the Department. Two Veterinary Assistants resigned, two were dismissed from the Department and five transferred to Eastern Bengal districts. There were thus at the close of the year 2 Veterinary Inspectors and 24 Veterinary Assistants in this Province. 33. A brief account of the work performed by the Inspectors is given below :6 35. The services of the Staff Veterinary Assistant K. C. Sen who was permanently stationed at Silehar were employed throughout the year in the district of Cachar. He was on tour for 225 days, inoculated 3,406 animals, treated 2,039 animals for contagious and non-contagious diseases, both at headquarters and mufussiL 36. The names of the following Assistants are noted for their good work:6 then be strengthened by 3 or 4 more men and under the guidance of a superior officer the disease could be controlled. In former years inoculation was limited by the limited supply of serum, but now a larger supply is available: it is only ne- cessary to have a larger reserve of trained men who can be promptly sent to any area to control more efficiently contagious disease. 47. In districts where large areas are under tea much good might be done by the Managers of the gardens closing temporarily the local cattle fairs and stopping all movement of cattle in or out of the garden when contagious disease is present. Such action requires a lot of tact and discretion and at the same time must be thoroughly done to be successful. 48. In perusing table II which shows the mortality it is evident that a large number of outbreaks are never reported to the department. In other cases outbreaks are reported when it is too late to be able to take any action. 49. During the year the office work has been efficiently carried out under the control of the head clerk (Babu Surendra Nath Ray) who is left in sole charge during my absence on tour, and consequently a considerable amount of responsibility rests on him. The office staff have also taken an interest in their work which has been satisfactory. W. HARRIS, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam,

The increase in the number and amount of the stipends recently sanctioned should produce more candidates, while the general spread of education and the consequent greater competition for clerical posts under Government will probably compel more to adopt the veterinary profes- sion. We were enabled to send the full number of stipendiaries this year to Belgachia, but their general standard of education was lower than I should have wished. 4. Treatment of disease.3 Including the Show at Shillong there were altogether 26 cattle fairs and shows, which afforded Veterinary Officers valuable opportunities of getting into touch with the class for whom their services are principally intended. 7. Subordinate establishment.REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1912-1913. PREFACE.2 There was only one private student attending the college in class A, who passed out his class examination and was promoted to the higher class during the year under report. 6. The number of Graduates allotted to this Province during the year was only two, and 8 Graduates were recruited from Bengal to fill up the vacancies, but they did not actually join the Department till after the close of the year. To attract a good type of men the value of the Government stipend has been increased from Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, and the number increased from 4 to 6; new conditions of pay and prospects of the subordinate service are being considered by which the cadre is expected to improve in the future. 7. During the year under report, a Nalbund was deputed to the Bengal Veterinary College to undergo a course of training in horse-shoeing at the cost of the Administra- tion. On his return, he was placed in Shillong Hospital with his own tools. If his work is appreciated and sufficient support given, a forge could be opened at the Veterinary Hospital. PART II.3 BOVINES. 16. Rinderpest.4 and the outbreak subsided. In all 4 Assistants and both the Inspectors were deputed to the spot. As the disease subsided, they were called back one after another, but the Staff Assistant had to be kept there for more than two months. 27. Anthrax.5. 38.

As a Staff Assistant he inoculated 472 head of cattle against rinderpest in Dibrugarh and was deputed to Mangaldai for over a month in connection with the treatment of a surra case under experiment. 53. Veterinary Assistant B. 0. Chatterjee joined the staff appointment at Gauhati on the 7th December 1912, and was on tour in the mofussil for 45 days. He attended the outbreak of rinderpest on the Mishmi road and inoculated 390 animals. He was also deputed to Peshawar in connection with the purchase, selection and escort of Dumha rams and ewes, etc., obtained for the Agriculture Department, Assam. At headquarters the services of Staff Assistants are required in the Laboratory, Serum depôt, etc. 54. During the year under report the services of Reserve Assistants were on con- tinuous requisition and they were deputed to the following places :8 62.

EDWARDS, ESQ., I.C.S., DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF LAND RECORDS AND AGRICULTURE, ASSAM, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the 1st July 1914. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Report of the Civil Veterinary Department of this province for the year ending the 31st March 1914, together with a brief report of Veterinary work in Manipur State, which is reproduced as Appendix A. 2. The report deals mainly with the internal working and organization of the Department and with practical achievement in the prevention and the suppression of disease. In both respects the year has been one of considerable progress, in spite of the difficulty encountered in recruitment of Veterinary Assistants. 3. The staff of the Department during the year was reinforced by 9 graduate Assistants, and on the 31st March 1914 stood at a total of 37 Veterinary Assistants : of these, 28 Assistants were employed under Local Boards, 3 in hill districts, 5 in the Reserve and 1 on the staff. This year 5 more Assistants have been appointed making a total of 42 in all against the sanctioned cadre of 51. Progress will necessa- rily be slow, as the vacant posts can be filled up only as qualified men are found to hold them. The results of the increase in the number and value of the scholarships offered at the Bengal Veterinary College have been less satisfactory than was anti- cipated. It is hoped, however, that, if the scheme for increase of pay, which has already been submitted, is sanctioned, there will be a marked improvement both in the numbers and qualifications of candidates. 4. The touring and inspection work of the Superintendent and Inspectors was generally satisfactory and compares favourably with that of last year. As a result of the Chief Commissioner's remarks in paragraph 1 of last year's Resolution on the Veterinary Report, orders were issued to the effect that the Superintendent should visit half the Veterinary Assistants in each year. During the year under review Mr. Harris and the Officiating Superintendent Mr. Hickey were on tour for 217 days and inspected the work of the majority of the Veterinary Assistants. The 3 Inspectors also made, on the average, 2 to 4 inspections of the work of each of the Veterinary Assistants within their respective circles, besides attending outbreaks. Mr. McSwiney inspected the Veterinary dispensaries at North Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Silchar. Sir Archdale Earle visited the Kohima dispensary. 5. Rinderpest, Foot-and-Mouth disease and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia form the principal classes of diseases which the Department has to combat. The total number of deaths among cattle from contagious diseases reported this year was 29,471 as against 45,642 in 1912-13, the figures generally, including those for rinderpest, being lower than those of the preceding year. The percentage of deaths from rinderpest was 26 per cent, against 50 per cent. in 1912-13.
2 Though these figures are satisfactory, as far as they go, it cannot hut he admitted that they are not altogether reliable. Nearly 80 per cent. of the deaths were reported from the Brahmaputra Valley. I am inclined to think that, the low figures reported elsewhere are due rather to faulty returns than, to conditions being much more favour- able than in the Brahmaputra Valley. 6. The useful character of the inoculation work done by the Veterinary Assistant! is apparent from the fact that out of 19,953 cattle inoculated in villages in which out breaks of, rinderpest occurred only 305 died of the disease, while 4,357 deaths were reported among uninoculated animals. In all, 16,325 animals were inoculated against 30,439 in 1912-13: of these, only 332 died after inoculation against 898 in the previous year. This represents a decrease on last year total, which is due to a very large decrease in the number of outbreaks of rinderj st. 7. During the year 1912-13, great impro 3ments were effected in the system of reporting outbreaks of cattle-disease. While must be admitted that the system is not carried out perfectly, it is satisfactory to te that considerable progress has been made. With growing knowledge among the people of what can be done to check contagious diseases, it is hoped that the apathy which at present stands in our way will be dissipated. While great efforts have been and will be made in this connection, the curing of defects is necessarily largely a matter of time. 8. Perhaps the most gratifying feature in the work of the past year is the increase in the number of cases treated by Veterinary Assistants while on. tour. The number of animals treated for contagious diseases was greater by 7,258 and for non-contagious diseases by 12 296 than in the previous year, the total increase in numbers being no less than 19,554. This goes to show that there is a growing appreciation on the part of the raiyat of the work of the Department. That the Veterinary Assistant should enjoy the confidence of the cultivator is a matter of paramount importance. It is a matter for regret that more use could not be made of the Dispensary at Dhubri. The new hospital at Gauhati should meet a real need. 9. The improvement of the breed of cattle is a question which is at present engaging the attention of the Agricultural Department, but there are many difficulties tobe overcome. It is expected that the report of the Special Officer deputed by the late Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam to enquire into this question will contain much useful information and advice. During the year there were 13 stud bulls maintained from the State and public funds, but their number is still so small that they can have little practical effect. The bull and sheep breeding operations on the Upper Shillong Farm have been continued with success. 10. Attention is invited to the remarks on cattle poisoners contained in paragraph 46. They are a pest to the localities concerned and it is obviously desirable that every effort should be made to bring them to justice. 11. I think that great credit is due to Messrs. Harris and Hickey for the energy they have shown in administering the Department, under considerable difficulties. The Inspectors appear to have worked satisfactorily. The staff of assistants leaves something to be desired both in the matter of quantity and quality. It is gratifying to observe, however, that Mr. Harris has been able to enumerate the names of certain officers as deserving of special commendation. Fairly constant and efficient supervision of the subordinate staff as a whole will doubtless always be necessary and its import- ance cannot be overestimated. As the supply of material improves, it will be easier to deal adequately with those of its members whose work is unsatisfactory. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. E. EDWARDS, Director, Department of Land Records and Agriculture, Assam.
Prescribed maximum length2 7. In the Laboratory 163 specimens were examined, of which. 20 were found to be Anthrax, 23 Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia and 21 Surra. Other blood and intestinal parasites were also examined from time to time. PART I.3 the reports were erroneous and misleading, and in some the disease had subsided before the Assistant got to the seat of outbreak. A large number of animals died of starvation and debility arising from an insufficient supply of fodder in at least one subdivision of the Province. The present system of reporting outbreaks of cattle-diseases seems to be an improvement and in course of time should become more satisfactory. EQUINES. 13. Glariders.4 23 Anthrax.5 animals died subsequently. In the previous year inoculation was carried out in 267 outbreaks, in which 8,653 animals died before inoculation and 30,439 animals were inoculated, of which 898 animals subsequently died. ITINERANT ASSISTANTS' WORK. 29. Table IV shows the number of animals treated and castrated by the Veterinary Assistants on tour during the year. The Assistants were 35 in number against 26 in the previous year. They visited 6,680 villages, castrated 118 animals, treated 16,263 animals for contagious diseases and 49,213 animals for non-contagious diseases. These make a total of 65,594 animals. In the previous year 6,083 villages were visited, 9,005 animals were treated for contagious diseases and 36,917 animals for non-conta- gious diseases, making a total of 46,026 animals. There is thus an increase of 7,258 animals treated for contagious diseases. This was due to the more or less prevalence of Foot-and-Mouth disease throughout the Province. The mortality from this disease is low if the animals are not neglected. There is an increase of 12,296 animals treated for non-contagious diseases. Thus the total increase in the number of cases treated by Assistants on tour from that of the last year is 19,554. The work of the itinerant staff compares very favourably when the actual increase in the number of the Assistants to that of the previous year is taken into consideration. These figures do not include those cases in Which men call for medicine for animals in the mofussil; medicines are given, but unless the Assist- ant actually sees the cases they are not counted as cases treated. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 30. Table V shows the working of the Hospitals and Dispensaries of which there were only 2 in number during the year under report. The total number of animals treated during the year6 36. Table IX shows the working of the Provincial Cattle Farm during the year 1913-1914. The total number of animals as reported by the Farm Superintendent was 66 on the 31st March, 1914, against 69 which was erroneously reported for 68 in the previous year. There were only 2 breeding bulls during the year and the farm- bred bulls have not been shown in this column, as they were not used for breeding purposes. During, the year 5 young bulls, 1 cow and 3 working bullocks were sold off; 2 cows and 1 bull calf died. The total number of births was 19 and that of deaths 9. During the winter the animals were fed on silage and hay, and they kept in good condition. The calves were hand fed. 37. The sheep-breeding experiment was continued during the year and showed an improvement on the local breed. The total number of sheep as reported by the Farm Superintendent was 125 against 144 in the previous year. The total number of births in the herd was 55 and that of deaths or otherwise 74 inclusive of the 2 Dumba- Khasi ram lambs sold. FAIRS AND SHOWS. 38. Table XIV reports the number of Cattle Fairs and Shows held in the Pro- vince during the year. There was considerable decrease in the number of Fairs held in the Cachar district; but the Deputy Commissioner of the district has not ad- vanced any reasons for this decrease. 39. The Shillong Agricultural Show was held in September last. The numbers of stock exhibited were small and the standard of the exhibits was poor. The Show was attended both by the Officiating Superintendent, Mr. S. G. M. Hickey, and the Inspector of the Circle. The other Shows were attended by the Inspectors of the circles concerned. PART IV.7 Besides his ordinary duties he inspected from time to time the breeding bulls (of which there were 4) in his own circle. He was present at the Cattle Show at Sylhet in January, 1914, where he was one of the judges ; both in this Show and at the Cattle Fair at Katigora near Badarpur he delivered short lectures on contagious diseases, the value of inoculation, etc. During the year under report he was deputed to Sonepur Fair (in Behar) for the purchase of plough bullocks for the Agricultural Department. (3) Babu Srish Chandra Ghosh was in charge of the Gauhati circle throughout the year and up to 1st May, 1913, he also held charge of the Dibrugarh circle during the absence on leave of the permanent incumbent, Mr. Satya Charan Mukherjee. During the year under report he was on tour for 1S1 days and visited 103 vil- lages and Tea Estates in connection with outbreaks, etc. He travelled 5,331 miles by rail, 1,199 miles by steamer and 1,529 miles by road and country boats. During the year the work of the Assistants in his own circle were inspected by him as follows :8 46. In several parts of the Province cattle poisoners have been busy. A. large number of cattle die from poison. The Local Authorities concerned were informed, hut there is no information that any arrests were made. 47. The Department is increasing very slowly in numbers, this it will con- tinue to do until the pay and prospects are sufficiently improved to attract more men with a better education. 48. Much of the emaciation and debility seen in the cattle in the plains is due to Distomatosis or liver fluke disease. This is a disease of water-logged areas and is not curable. The best method of prevention is to remove the cattle to high dry soil, A form of this disease is found in elephants in Assam and causes death when infection is severe. 49.

The number of outbreaks in the province has been gradually decreasing. The Superintendent observes that, since the extension of the present system of reporting outbreaks of cattle disease, some progress has been noticed, but there is still great room for improvement. With growing knowledge among the people of what can be done to check contagious diseases, there should be great progress. 7. During this year Itinerant Assistants visited 7,533 villages and treated 17,633 animals for contagious and 55,494 for non-cantagious diseases besides castrating 174 animals. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 6,680, 16,263, 49,213 and 118. The progress in this direction is most gratifying. The importance of work in villages cannot, I think, be overestimated. 8. During the year under report there were only 2 hospitals, one at Shillong and one at Silchar. A third one has since been opened at Gauhati and has been declared to be an infirmary, like the Shillong hospital. The Superintendent has also been furnished with a laboratory. 9. In connection with the breeding of cattle, Mr. Blackwood's report on cattle census is being still awaited. A scheme for cattle breeding in Manipur is now under consideration. The breeding of sheep at the Upper Shillong Farm has not, for various reasons which need not now be enumerated, been, on the whole, a success. The question of whether it should not be discontinued has lately been raised and is likely to be decided shortly. 10. The staff of the Department during the year was reinforced by 5 new gradua- tes but the strength was reduced by the resignation of 4 assistants. The total strength at the end of the year was 38 Veterinary Assistants and 3 Inspectors : of these 31 Assistants were under Local Boards, 2 in hill districts, 4 in the Reserve and 1 on the staff. It will take some time to bring the number up to the sanctioned cadre of 51, as vacant posts can be filled only when qualified men are available. 11. Attention is invited to the remarks of Mr. Harris in paragraph 43 on the subject of reports of outbreaks and in paragraph 45 on that of the greater use which might be made of Veterinary Hospitals in connection with cases of cruelty. Credit is due to Mr. Harris for his energetic administration of the Department. The inspectors appear to have worked satisfactorily, on the whole. It is gratifying to observe that Mr. Harris has been able to refer to the good work done by a considerable proportion of the staff of Assistants working under him. The supply of suitable men is not great and the difficulties of managing the Department are considerable. In spite of this progress has been and will, I venture to predict, continue to be made. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. R. EDWARDS, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Assam.

PREFACE.2 The number of Local Board stipendiaries was distributed as follows :3 19. Anthrax.4 The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was carried out during the year was 184, in which 25 equines, 4,252 bovines and 2 others died before inoculation, and 452 equines, 20,215 bovines and 450 others were inoculated of which 244 bovines and 3 others was reported to have died subsequently. In the previous year inoculation was carried out in 236 outbreaks in which 16 equines, 4,672 bovines and 266 others died before inoculation, and 474 equines, 24,702 bovines and 1,149 others were inoculated, of which 2 equines, 868 bovines, and 12 others died subsequently. There is thus a total reduction of 5,208 inoculations when comparing the year under report with the previous year. ITINERANT ASSISTANTS' WORK. 25. Table IV shows the work of the Veterinary Assistants in the mofussil during the year. The Assistants were 39 in number; they visited 7,533 villages, castrated 174 animals and treated 17,633 animals for contagious diseases and 55,494 animals for non-contagious diseases. In the previous year 6,680 villages were visited, 118 animals were castrated and 16,263 and 49,213 animals, respectively, were treated for contagious and non-contagious diseases. There is a further increase of 7,651 animals treated for contagious and non-contagious diseases. The total number of animals annually treated on tour for the last three years are 45,922 65,476 and 73,127, respectively. This steady progress points to greater appreciation of veterinary work by the people in the mofussil. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 26. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the Province. During the year under report, 812 equines, 2,562 bovines and 840 others were treated as in and out-patients making a total of 4,214. In the previous year 4,462 animals were treated as in and out-patients of which 567 were equines, 3,332 bovines and 563 other animals. 27. Silchar Veterinary Hospital.5 31. The sheep-breeding experiment was continued daring the year. The total number of sheep was 88 on the 31st March, 1915, against 125 reported in the previous year. There were 63 lambs born during the year. The mortality in the flock was 105 including 48 animals which were accidentally destroyed by fire. Much of the mortality was due to a severe infection with strongylosis. The efforts made to combat the disease seem to have checked it for the present. FAIRS AND SHOWS. 32. Table XIV reports the number of cattle fairs and shows held in the Province during the year. There was a considerable decrease in the number of cattle present at the fairs in Goalpara district; the Deputy Commissioner reports that this is due to the fact that the raiyats could not purchase sufficient cattle this year owing to the fall in price of jute and also that cattle mortality in the district was less than in the previous year. 33. The Agricultural Show at Shillong was attended by me. In this show the general level of the live-stock was poor but there were several outstanding exhibits of cattle6 The work of the following Itinerant Veterinary Assistants was inspectd as follows :7 39. The names of the following Assistants are noted for their good work :8 46. In the Barpeta subdivision an outbreak of contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia, was reported. This is the first occasion on which this disease has been brought to the direct notice of the Department in Assam. 47. The office and dispensary were removed to the new buildings on the 1st Janu- ary, 1915, the laboratory building was occupied in May last and the other buildings for the accommodation of in-patients are approaching completion. Considerable damage to the new buildings was done by the tornado on the 3rd April 1915. 48. The office establishment under the control of the Head Clerk, Babu Surendra Nath Roy, has carried out its work efficiently and satisfactorily. W.

In 1914-15, 4217 animals died out of 21,117 inoculated. Though higher than in last year the proportion of deaths reported among inoculated cattle is not large. I understand that one great difficulty is that in some cases, some of the villagers refuse to have their cattle inoculated. The result is that the disease spreads slowly among the cattle which have not been inoculated and may in time attack some of those which have been, when the period of immunity secured by inoculation has expired. 6. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was carried out was 466 against 184 in the last year. As desired by the Chief Commissioner in paragraph 4 of the review of last year's report I addressed Deputy Commissioners on the subject of the improvement in the matter of the reporting of cattle disease. There has been some improvement, but it is hoped that there will be more. 7. During the year, itinerant assistants visited 6,621 villages and treated 15,543 animals for contagious and 44,213 for non-contagious diseases besides castrating 220 animals. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 7,533, 17,633, 55,494 and 174. The decrease is a matter for regret. At the same time, apart from other causes to which the Superintendent refers, the work of inoculation during the year claimed an unusually large share of attention. The necessity of work among villa- gers is frequently impressed upon Veterinary Assistants. 8. With the opening of the Gauhati Hospital during the year under report the number of Veterinary Hospitals in the province rose to 3. With reference to para- graph 5 of the review of the last Veterinary report I beg to state that, as proposed by me, the Hospital at Silchar has been declared to be an Infirmary under the Cruelty to Animals Act; all three Hospitals are now Infirmaries under the Act. I have made suggestions to Deputy Commissioners with a view to the Hospitals being more fully utilised in connection with cases of cruelty to animals. The question of the issue of detailed instructions to Magistrates is now under consideration. 9. In connection with the breeding of cattle, Mr. Blackwood's report; which is now in print is expected shortly to be available. The scheme for cattle breeding in Manipur was sanctioned as an experimental measure but it could not be materialized on account of financial stringency. Sheep breeding at the Upper Shillong farm has been discontinued. If this is taken up again, it will have to be on new lines. 10. The staff of the Department was increased by the appointment of only 1 newly qualified Assistant, while its strength was reduced by the loss of 3 assistants of whom 1 resigned and 2 were removed from service. The total strength at the end of the year was 36 assistants and 3 Inspectors : of these 28 assistants are under Local Boards, 2 in hill districts, 5 in the reserve and 1 on the staff. As already indicated, the present difficulty experienced in adding to the staff is likely to become less if not to disappear. 11. The work of the Department has been, on the whole, satisfactory. Credit is due to Mr. Harris. His Inspectors appear to have done well, while he has been able to mention a number of Assistants for good work. One of the Assistants, U Kollington has lately had his services placed at the disposal of the military authorities. 12. A reference is invited to the proposal made by the Political Agent, Manipur, that Government should permit the Superintendent and his subordinates to make periodical visits of inspection to the State Dispensary. While I have every sympathy with the proposal I must point out that, without special facilities for travelling, a visit to Manipur would mean the expenditure of considerable time. I hope that it may be possible to arrange for the Superintendent to inspect the Dis- pensary, but in view of the heavy calls on his time and that of the Inspectors, I would deprecate the passing of orders that any of them must do so at stated intervals. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. R. EDWARDS, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Assam.
Prescribed maximum length2 There were four Local Board stipendiaries distributed as follows : 3 18. Foot-and-Muth disease.4 Inoculation was undertaken in 33 outbreaks in 14 subdivisions. In these out- breaks 1 equine, 363 bovines died before inoculation. Seven equines, 4,(517 bovines and 2 others were inoculated, of which 28 bovines were reported to have died subsequently. In the previous year inoculation was carried out in 12 outbreaks in 7 subdivisions. In these outbreaks 292 bovines died before inoculation, 1,537 bovines were inoculated, of which 9 bovines died subsequently. There was increase of 3,089 in inoculation under this head over that of the previous year. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken during the year was 466, in which 29 equines, 10,099 bovines and 43 others died before inocula- tion and 699 equines, 48,279 bovines, 184 others were inoculated. After inoculation 685 animals are reported to have died. In the previous year inoculation was carried out in 184 outbreaks. In these outbreaks 25 equines, 4 252 bovines and 2 others died before inoculation, and 452 equines, 20,215 bovines and 450 others were inoculated, of which 244 bovines and 3 others died subsequently. There is thus a total increase in inoculation of 25,045 animals in comparison with the previous year. ITINERANT ASSISTANTS' WORK. 27. Table IV shows the work of the Assistants in the moffussil during the year. Thirty-eight Assistants were thus employed and they visited 6,021 villages, castrated 220 animals, and treated 15,543 animals for contagious diseases and 44,213 for non- contagious diseases. In the previous year 39 Assistants visited 7,533 villages, castrated 174 animals, and treated 17,633 animals for contagious and 55,494 for non-contagious diseases. It will appear that in the number of animals treated for contagious and non- contagious diseases there has been a decrease of 13,371 from the figures of the previous year. This is due in part to the smaller number of Assistants available, and to the greater time spent in inoculation work. More Assistants were also on leave this year or off duty due to fever, sickness, etc. The heavy floods also interfered with field work for some time. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 28. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the Province. During the year 1,098 equines, 2,872 bovines and 974 others were treated as in and out patients making a total of 4,944 animals. In the previous year 812 equines, 2,562 bovines and 840 others were treated making a total of 4,214 animals. 29. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.5 one casualty during the year. The total number of bulls was thus 11 as compared with 12 at the end of the previous year. A few applications were received for stud- bulls but none could be supplied as suitable animals were not obtainable. 34. Table IX shows the results of: the working of the Provincial Cattle Farm at Shillong for the year. The number of cattle at the beginning of the year was 70 ; 25 calves were born at the Farm, 5 bulls were sold off and 5 animals died ; the total at the close of the year under report was 85. During the winter the animals were fed on silage and hay, and they kept in good condition throughout the season. The sheep breeding is to be discontinued and 37 animals have already been sold off. The total number of sheep at the end of the year was 45, against 83 of the previous year. FAIRS AND SHOWS. 35. Table XIV shows the number of cattle fairs and shows held in the province. The figures for the Goalpara district also include the outturns at the weekly or bi- weekly cattle markets throughout the district. There appears to be a considerable decrease in the number of stock present at the Katigorah cattle fair (Cachar). This may be doe to the occurrence of unusual floods during the rains. 36. The annual cattle show at Shillong could not be held this year owing to the sudden outbreak of cholera in the town. 37. The Sylhet cattle show was discontinued by the Local Board after several years' trial as the main object was not attained. There was no improvement shown in the general appearance of the cattle, in the selection of breeding animals, or in the care of the young stock. At this show every effort was made to instruct the people by lectures, distribution of pamphlets and demonstrations by a Veterinary Inspector PART IV6 In his circle there were extensive outbreaks of Rinderpest, Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. He examined microscopically 27 specimens, of which 15 proved to be Anthrax, 5 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 1 Blackquarter, all of which were subsequently con- firmed by me. (3) Babu Srish Chandra Ghosh, Inspector, was in charge of the Gauhati Circle up to the 13th February 1916, when he went on privilege leave. On rejoining he was temporarily transferred to the Dibrugarh Circle and remained there till the end of the year. In the Gauhati Circle be was in charge of 9 District Assistants and all the staff and Reserve Assistants either at headquarters or working in his Circle. The District Assistants were inspected as follows .7 Maulvi Syed Ataul Haque, Moriani, Srijut Madhab Chandra Das, Barpeta, Maulvi Azizuddin Sarker, Golaghat, Babu Jatindra Narain Roy, Sunamganj, Babu Suresh Chandra Chanda, Nowgong.

No. IV-202 5. The utility of the inoculation work done by the Veterinary Assistants is proved hy the fact that out of 29,986 animals inoculated against rinderpest, there were 671 deaths, while 9,633 died before inoculation. In all, 36,016 animals were inoculated, of which only 578 are reported to have died. The number of inoculations done this year shows a decrease, which is due partly to the smaller number of outbreaks reported and partly to the reduction in the number of Veterinary Assistants owing to the deputation of some of them to the Military Department. 6. There has been a considerable improvement in the work of the Veterinary Assistants in villages. During the year they visited 6,729 villages, treated 25,593 animals for contagious and 34,912 for non-contagious diseases and castrated 246 animals. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 6,621, 15,543, 44,213 and 220. The increase is creditable, as we had only 34 Assistants against 38 in the previous year. 7. No addition has been made to the number of Veterinary Hospitals during the year, but 3 new dispensaries were opened at Patharkandi (Karimganj), Badlipar (Golaghat) and Behali (Darrang). With a view to the hospitals being utilised in connection with cases of cruelty to animals, some detailed instructions have been issued to the Deputy Commi sioners of Cachar, Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Kamrup in the Revenue Department Circular No. 3R., dated the 23rd March 1917. 8. Regarding the breeding of cattle, Mr. Blackwood's report on the survey and Census of cattle in Assam was published during the year. The recommendations made therein, as well as the scheme for cattle-breeding in Manipur, were discussed with Messrs. Harris and McKay and Colonel Smith, Principal of the Bengal Veteri- nary College, and a report on the result of the discussion was submitted in my letter No. 2717, dated the 24th May 1917. 9. The staff of the Department was increased by the appointment of two newly qualified Assistants, while it was reduced by the loss of one who resigned. Six of the Veterinary Assistants were deputed to military duty, of whom one was returned as unsuitable. There were therefore at the end of the year 3 Inspectors and 32 Assistants. Of the Veterinary Assistants, 27 were under Local Boards, one on the staff, three in reserve and one in the hills. Pour stipendiaries who passed out from the Bengal Veterinary College have since been appointed Veterinary Assistants; therefore, on the return of the 5 Veterinary Assistants from military duty, we shall have 41. Taking into consideration the 20 stipendiaries now in the Bengal Veterinary College, we expect to have within three years more than enough qualified candidates to fill up the sanctioned staff of 51, as indicated above. 10. The work of the Department has been, on the whole, satisfactory and credit is due to Mr. Harris for his administration. The Inspectors appear to have done well, while Mr. Harris has been able to mention a number of his Assistants for good work : I think that it is very creditable that we have been able to supply 5 Assistants out of our small staff to the Army Department: we could hardly spare more and I am not sure that we can spare any just now for the Indian Defence Force. It is to be hoped that some results may eventually be achieved from the investigation into kumri at Muktesar. I have the honour to be, SIR, Tour most obedient Servant, J. McSWINEY, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Astartt.

Table IV shows the work of the Assistants in the moffussil during the year. In all, 34 Assistants worked in the interior and they visited 6,729 villages, castrated 246 animals, treated 25,593 animals for contagious and 34,912 animals for non-con- tagious diseases. In the previous year, 38 Assistants were thus employed and they visited 6,621 villages, castrated 220 animals and treated 15,543 animals for contagious and 44,213 for non-contagious diseases. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 28. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the province. During the year, 481 equines, 2,371 bovines and 682 other animals were treated as in and out-patients. In the previous year. 1,098 equines, 2,872 bovines and 974 other animals were treated as in and out-patients. 29. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.5 PART IV.6 He examined and treated all cases (62) seized under the Cruelty to Animals Act and brought to the Infirmary and gave evidence in court as witness when required. Prom the beginning of the year up to the 11th June 1916, Babu Bhudhar Chan- dra Chatterjee was in charge of the office of the Inspector, Gauhati Circle, in addition to his own duties when the permanent incumbent was deputed to the Dibrugarh Circle. (5) The number of Reserve Veterinary Assistants fluctuated very much during the year, the number available for the major portion of the year was only three. One was on deputation for work on the Mishmi road from the beginning of the year till the 13th June 1916, and another from the 9th September 1916 till the end of the year. The main work of the available Reserve Assistants was done in the districts of Cachar, Sylhet, Goalpara and Lushai Hills. One Reserve Assistant was permanently posted to Silchar Circle from the 2nd May 1916. 39. The names of the following subordinates are mentioned for the interest and care they have taken in their professional work throughout the year :7 lecture was given on the general principles of shoeing and the Farrier Sergeants were instructed in their work and afterwards written and practical examinations were held in which all the candidates passed. 44. The Veterinary Assistants of the Department were asked to volunteer for military duty in India. After a considerable lapse of time, six out of 36 ultimately volunteered and were accepted and joined at various dep6ts. Five are still serving and one was returned by the Military Department as unsuitable. It was disappointing that more men did not volunteer, as they lost an opportunity of gaining experience in both general and professional matters which would have greatly benefited and helped them throughout their career. 45. For the Indian Defence Force two have volunteered, 19 have stated that they are not willing or cannot join owing to circumstances and 18 have not yet replied. 46. Towards the end of the year I had an opportunity of visiting Manipur State and inspecting the cattle and the Veterinary dispensary. The dispensary is well equipped and is doing good work. 47.

The heaviest mortality from this disease occurred in Goalpara, where 14,3-94 animals are said to have died against only 476 in the previous year : the result is due to the want of reporting outbreaks when they occur. No reliance can be placed on the statistics of mortality, but they probably show the general incidence of disease during the year. The number of outbreaks reported has, however, largely increased since last year and shows that there has been an improve- ment in the matter of reporting cattle disease. 5. The inoculation work done by the Assistants was satisfactory. Out of 38,295 animals inoculated against rinderpest there were 345 deaths, while b,956 animals died before inoculation : the corresponding figures in the previous year were 29,986, 571 and 9,[Prescribed maximum length2 There were 4 Local Board stipendiaries distributed as follows :3 17.

He inspected the work of the Assistants at Sibsagar, Nazira, Mariani, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia 4 times each, Tezpur, Mangaldai, Jorhat, Golaghat and Badlipar 3 times each. Behali and North Lakhimpur twice each and Kohima once. (2) Babu Guru Prasanna Sen was in charge of the Silchar Circle throughout the year. He was on tour for 157 days and travelled 2,276 miles by rail, 1,832 miles by road and 882 miles by boat. He visited and revisited 116 villages and tea gardens in investigation of cattle-disease. He inspected the work of the Assistants at Silchar, Karimganj, Patharkandi and Habiganj 5 times each, Hailakandi, Sylhet, Maulvi Bazar and Second Veteri- nary Assistant, Silchar, 4 times each and Srimangal thrice. (3) Babu Srish Chandra Ghosh was in charge of the Gauhati Circle throughout the year, and he also held charge of Dibrugarh Circle during the absence on leave of the permanent incumbent. He was on tour for 149 days, visited 118 villages and tea estates in connection with outbreaks, etc. He travelled 2,990 miles by rail, 606 miles by steamer and 1,491 miles by read. He inspected the work of Dhubri, Bilashipara, Gauhati, Nalbari Barpeta and Nowgong four times each, Goalpara three times and Shillong twice during the year under report. During the year he inspected the Upper Shillong Farm. The breeding bulls in his circle were inspected by him. While at headquarters he assisted in the Labora- tory and Hospital work. (4) Babu Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee was the Staff Assistant during the year. He has been on privilege leave for 3 months from 16th March 1918, Babu Hem Chandra Sen, Veterinary Assistant, Shillong, officiating in his place. His duties were the same as in previous years6 considered. Most of the Assistants are in isolated posts where they have little or no opportunity to keep their professional work up to date and where they are inclined to forget much which is essential. 41. A sufficient supply of serum has been received from the Muktessar Laboratory during the year. The number of doses received this year and previous years is as follows :-7 TABLE II.

The number of outbreaks of contagious diseases reported during the year was 210 against 698 in the previous year and the province was practically free from any serious or extensive outbreaks of cattle-disease. As the outbreaks of rinderpest were fewer than usual, there was a considerable fall in inoculations. The number of inoculations carried out for rinderpest was 10,817 as against 33,295 for last year. The results were satisfactory. Out of the total number of 20,391 animals inoculated there were only 34 deaths, while 1,512 animals died before inoculation. The largest number of inoculations against riaderpest was done by the Assistants at Sibsagar and Tinsukia. 6. The number of cases treated on tour was 53,916 and of animals castrated, 210 against 49,718 and 17.3, respectively, last year. This increase in the number of cases treated is promising, proving, as it does, that the Depaitment is energetic aud probably gaining the confidence of the people. 7. No addition has been made to the number of hospitals during the year. 8. Cattle breeding at the Shillong farm is managed by the Agriculture Depart- ment and really should not appear in this report at all. The general scheme for the breeding of cattle in the province is still under the consideration of the Local Administration. 9. Three Veterinary Assistants were appointed during the year, one Assistant reverted from military duty and one resigned. At the close of the year there were 43 Assistants, of whom 4 were on military duty, 1 on the staff, 5 in reserve and the remaining 33 were available for local service. Eight Assistants were appointed at the close of the year and this has completed the cadre of 51 Veterinary Assistants for the province. The Superintendent has reported that some of the Local Boards have refused to employ a second Veterinary Assistant for want of funds, but I find that when the Boards' budgets were submitted to him, he neglected to suggest the provision for such additions and I consider that we cannot expect the Boards to appoint men unless they have funds provided. The need for a second Veterinarv Assistant under most Local Boards was adumbrated in paragraph 2 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution No. 2194R., dated the 24th September 1912, on the report of the Veterinary Department for 1911-12. As the Chief Commissioner was prepared to grant the necessary financial assistance to any Boards which are unable to employ the additional staff owing to shortness of funds, it is desirable that they should apply for the same in time. I have asked the Superintendent to suggest provision for additional staff when the Boards budgets are submitted to him. In pursuance of parr graph 5 of the Resolution on the last year's veterinary report I submitted to the Chief Commissioner a proposal for the post-graduate training of Veterinary Assistants in rotation, and the question is still under considera- tion. 30. The Department has been efficiently managed by Mr. Harris throughout the year, despite the fact that he has had to work with a depleted staff. I have to bring to the notice of the Chief Commissioner the names of Babus Guru Prasanna Sen and Srish Chandra Ghosh, Veterinary Inspectors, and the few Assistants whese services have been specially commended by the Superintendent for good work. Owing to the absence on leave of Mr. Harris, Babu Gum Prasanna Sen has been appointed to act as Superintendent since 21st May 1919. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. McSWINEY, Director of land Records and Agriculture, Assam.
Prescribed maximum length2 6. There were 4 Local Board stipendiaries distributed as follows : 3 17. Foot-and-mouth disease.4 27. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was carried out was 201, in which 1,912 animals died before inoculation, 20,394 animals were inoculated, of which 34 animals subsequently died. In the previous year inoculation was under- taken in 698 outbreaks in which 9,814 animals died before inoculation and 45,704 animals were inoculated of which 369 animals died subsequently. ITINERANT ASSISTANTS' WORK. 29. Table IV shows the work of the Veterinary Assistants in the mofussil during the year. The Assistants were 39 in number, they visited 6,639 villages, castrated 210 animals and treated 12,966 animals for contagious diseases and 40,980 animals for non contagious diseases. In the previous year 6,685 villages were visited, 173 animals were castrated and 10,562 and 39,156 animals, respectively, were treated for contagious and non-contagious diseases. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 29. Table V shows the working of the three hospitals. The total number of animals treated as both in and out-patients was 3,319. In the previous year the total was 3,391. 30. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.5 PART IV.6 mentioned for satisfactory work. The intellectual standard of the majority is low and only a few show any natural aptitude for the work. A more suitable class of men may ultimately be induced to take up Veterinary work when the pay and prospects are improved. It is difficult at present to find suitable Assistants for the higher and more responsible departmental posts. 40. The following Veterinary Inspectors are mentioned as having carried out their duties in a satisfactory and competent manner :7 TABLE II.

The outbreaks reported during the year were 388 against 201 in the previous year. The number of inoculations against rinderpest increased by 11,128. A severe outbreak of rinderpest occurred towards the latter part of the year in Sylhet, which was alone responsible for 12,889 inoculations, i.e., more than half the number done during the year. Out of the total number of 32,172 animals inoculated there were 284 deaths while 6,168 animals died before inoculation. In pursuance of the Resolution of the last Veterinary Report, arrangements have been made for short lectures by Veterinary Assistants on cattle diseases to gatherings of village chaukidars and gaonburas with a view to impressing upon them the value of inoculation and segregation and of promptly reporting outbreaks. 7. The number of cases treated on tour increased by 4,803 animals, while those treated in hospitals were 80 less than in the previous year. There was a considerable improvement in the work of the Itinerant Assistants. It is hoped that the Shillong hospital, which is responsible for the falling off of cases treated in hospitals, will regain its position this year. 8. The number of stud bulls under local bodies is limited to 11, of which 5 are in Goalpara, 1 in Darrang and 2 each in Nowgong and Sibsagar. It is gratifying to note that the Hon'ble Mr. Kamini Kumar Chanda presented a bull to the Silchar Municipality. 9. During the year five new Veterinary Assistants were appointed, three returned from military service, while one resigned. At the end of the year there were 46 Veterinary Assistants, including 2 in the Staff, 5 in the Reserve and 3 in the Hills, and one still on military duty. The pay of the Veterinary Assistants has been raised to Rs. 50Prescribed maximum length2 8. There were also three Local Board stipendiaries in the College and they were distributed as follows :3 17. Dourine and Epizootic Lymphangitis.4 27. Anthrax.5 No case under the Cruelty to Animals Act was brought to the hospital for treatment. A sum of Rs. 364-8-0 was credited to the treasury as dispensary fees as against Rs. 503-8-0 in the previous year. PART III.6 He examined 116 blood smears during the year of which twenty-four proved Anthrax, thirteen Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and forty-two Surra which were subsequently confirmed by the Superintendent. (3) Babu Guru Prasanna Sen was in charge of the Gauhati Circle from 7th April to 20th May and 1st January to 29th February. He was out on tour for 20 days and travelled 177 miles by road and 323 miles by rail and visited 23 villages in connection with the result of inoculation and investigation of cattle diseases. He was on privilege leave for two months from 1st March 1920. (4) Babu Bhudhar Chandra Chatterjee, staff Veterinary Assistant was appointed officiating Veterinary Inspector, Gauhati Circle, during the appoint- ment of Babu Guru Prasanna Sen as officiating Superintendent. He remained in charge of the circle for 216 days (from 1st to 6th April, 21st May to 9th December and 25th to 31st December 1919). He was on tour for 81 days and travelled 1,316 miles by rail, 342 miles by steamer and 868 miles by road and visited 37 villages. He inspected the work of the Veterinary Assistants at Gauhati, Shillong, Nowgong, Nalbari, Barpeta, Bilashipara, Dhubri, Pathsala and Abhayapuri once each and Goalpara twice. He was also deputed to Sadiya to investigate a Surra case. He investigated suspected Surra and Glanders cases at Gauhati and Shillong, respectively. He failed to carry out the requisite number of inspections. He was on privilege leave for 15 days from 10th December 1919. He was again on leave without pay from 14th January to the end of the year. (5) Babu Hem Chandra Sen was a staff Veterinary Assistant during the year. He was on tour for 22 days and visited 15 villages. His duties amongst others were receiving, despatching and keeping accounts of Sera etc., assisting in the Laboratory and attending the in and out-patients in Gauhati Hospital. He was in charge of the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Gauhati Circle, from 10th December to 24th December 1919 and again from 1st March to the end of the year when the Veterinary Inspector was on privilege leave.

The number of cases treated in hospitals, both in and out patients, rose from 3,239 to 3,566 and the castrations per- formed from 12 to 42. 8. The number of stud bulls under local bodies was 10 against 11 in the previous year, of which 5 are in Goalpara, 2 in Nowgong and one each in Cacbar, Darrang and Sibsagar. The mention of 3 stud bulls in the Khasi Hills is a mistake : these are breeding bulls in the Shillong herd of Patna cattle and are not available for public use. The castration of weedy bulls is an important factor in the general scheme for cattle-breeding and I would draw the attention to Burdizzo's castrator mentioned in paragraph 48 of the Superintendent's report in this connection: unfortunately, like so many other desiderata it is a somewhat expensive instrument costing about Rs. 75 and consequently its use is not likely to spread into the villages. 9. Daring the year three new Assistants were appointed, while four resigned and the services of one were dispensed with. At the end of the year there were 3 Inspect- ors and 45 Assistants, including one on military duty, two in the Staff and three each in the Reserve and the Hills. The sanctioned cadre of 52 Assistants has been in- creased by 6 Reserve and 1 Hills Assistant. During the year the pay of Inspectors was raised to Rs. 100Prescribed maximum length2 8. Fire Local Board stipendiaries attended the College. They were distributed as follows:3 BOVINES. 19.

Nine bullocks were sent to the Hospital under the Cruelty to Animals Act for treatment against nil in the previous year. A sum of Rs. 720-4-0 was credited to the treasury as dispensary fees as against Rs. 364-8-0 in the previous year. The increase is due to the private practice of the former Assistant being disallowed owing to unsatisfactory work. PART III.6 Assistant, Patharkandi, Habiganj, Sunamganj, Jagannathpur, thrice each and Aijal once. He visited 131 villages and tea estates in connection with the iavesti- gation of disease. He examined 65 specimens, of which 9 proved Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, 5 Surra, 11 Anthrax, all of which were duly confirmed. During the year a severe and extensive outbreak of Rinderpest occurred in the Surma Valley and much of bis time was occupied in arranging inoculation work and checking results of inocula- tion. (4) Babu Hem Chandra Sen held charge of the Gauhati Circle except for a period of 3 months when he was on privilege leave. Babu Satish Chandra Das Gupta, Staff Veterinary Assistant, acted in bis place for that period in addition to his own duties. The Inspector was on tour for 135 days and travelled 1.953 miles by rail, 393 miles by steamer and 1,594 miles by road. He visited 199 villages in checking inoculation results and other work. The following dispensaries were inspected by him :7 44 .A sufficient supply of Serum has been received during the year.

During the year 5 new Assistants were appointed, while one resigned. At the end of the year there were 3 Inspectors and 48 Assistants including one on military duty, two on the staff and 4 each in the reserve and the Hills Districts. Since the close of the year 3 new Assistants have been appointed and one has resigned. So at present there are 50 Veterinary Assistants against the sanctioned cadre of 59. The reluctance of some Local Boards to appoint a Second Assistant is regrettable and tends to cause a serious loss in money to the people from disease. The method of reporting outbreaks was improved during the year. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. McSWINEY, Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Assam.

[Prescribed Maximum length2 PART I.3 BOVINES. 20. Rinderpest.4 33. The total number of outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken during the year was 276 in which 17 equines, 3,628 bovines and 7 others died before inocula- tion; 277 equines, 21,719 bovines were inoculated of which 2 equines and 151 bovines are reported to have died subsequently. In the previous year inoculation was performed in 317 outbreaks in which 7 equines, 5,520 bovines and 2 others died before inoculation; 158 equines, 23,848 bovines and 6 others were inoculated of which 309 were reported to have died subsequently. The monthly return showing the existence of contagious diseases was regularly submitted to the Consul General for Italy. ITINERANT ASSISTANTS' WORK. 34. Table IV shows the work of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistants of this province during the year under report. They visited 8,739 villages, performed 465 castrations and treated 18,702 and 43,737 animals for contagious and non-contagious diseases respectively. In the previous year 8,470 villages were visited, 675 castrations were performed and 14,890 and 46,194 animals were treated for contagious and non- contagious diseases. There is an increase of 3,812 cases treated for contagious diseases over the figures of the previous year, which was due to greater prevalence of foot- and-mouth disease, and Bovine Infectious Lymphangitis, etc. The itinerating work of five circles was temporarily suspended as the Assistants in charge were granted leave and no reserve was available to fill up the vacancies. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 35. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals. The total number of animals treated in these Hospitals during the year as both in and out-patients were 3,783 against 3,802 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the clese of Shillong Dispensary for a considerable time when the Assistant was in the interior attending the outbreaks. The total number of cases supplied with medicines was 784. The distribution of medicines without the case being seen is not encouraged, as much medicine may be wasted by a misleading description of the symptoms, or by faulty application or administration. Owners were encouraged to bring their animals for examination and treatment in the dispensaries. 36. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.5 Twenty four animals were sent to the Hospital by the Police under the Cruelty to Animals Act for treatment against 31 of the previous year. A sum of Rs. 366-4 was credited to the Treasury as Dispensary fees against Rs. 400-14 in the previous year. The head-quarters work suffered considerably owing to the Veterinary Assistant's long absence in the interior and that is the main cause for the fall of Hospital receipts and the decrease in the treatment of total animals in the Dispensary during the year.

The submission of monthly returns of Anthrax outbreaks to the American Consul General, Calcutta, have been continued. 31. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 5 A sum of Rs. 560-13-0 was credited to the Treasury as Dispensary fees and bills for Rs. 222-12-0 were adjusted through accepted bills for services rendered to the animals of other Government Departments against a total of Rs. 717-13-0 in the previous year. 39. Silchar Veterinary Hospital.6 (2) Babu Srish Chandra Ghosh, Veterinary Inspector, Silchar Circle, was on tour for 115 days and visited 79 villages and Tea Estates in connection with inspec- tion work and investigation of epidemics. He travelled 1,428 miles by road, 168 miles by steamer and 1,357 miles by road and country boat. The following Hospital and Dispensaries were inspected by him :7 49. The Local Boards in Assam incurred the following expenditure in connection with Veterinary charges. These figures are furnished by the Boards and are included in the above total. Rs. a. p.

PART VI.8 of serum and virulent blood would not be acceptable to most of the people in the plains, the Department has been investigating the value of the next best method, i.e., the infection of inoculated animals by saliva or nasal discharge from sick ani- mals. This method has been carried out in a large number of animals and it has been observed that a little over 33 per cent. of them have shown a reaction chiefly a rise in temperature. This means that these animals are permanently immune and the method is an improvement on the serum alone method, but it is far behind the double inoculation in value. Investigations have been continued in the treatment of rinderpest by intravenous injections of Tartar Emetic. If given in the early stages it has been found that the mortality is reduced considerably. 54 The treatment of Nasal Granuloma by the intravenous injection of Tartar Emetic continued to give satisfactory results in the majority of cases. It is suspected that the drug if used in too large doses may wake up dormant coccidioses and produce a severe attack of the latter. Several hundreds of cattle were inspected on the old Cherrapunjee road being marched from Assam through the Khasia Hills to the Sylhet district. Several cases of Nasal Granuloma were found amongst these cattle. The Sylhet district has been comparatively free of this disease up to date. 55. Besides the above, further investigations have been carried out in the treat- ment of Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, Epizootic Lymphangitis, Kumree, Kari in elephants, Bursatee and bovine infectious Lymphangitis as opportunity occurred. 56. The total number of castrations has risen from 753 to 1,046. Castration of weedy bulls is one of the most important steps in any scheme for the improvement of local cattle. Assistants have been impressed with this fact and instructed to carry on this work as much as possible. With the Burdizzio castrator properly applied they have an advantage over all other methods. The Veterinary Assistant, Tezpur, (Maulvi Azizuddin Sarkar), performed the largest number of bovine castration (76), and the Veterinary Assistant, Sibsagar, (Maulvi Syed Ataul Haque), was second with 55 bovine castrations. I regret to note that 21 Assistants did no bovine cas- tration even after being specially asked to devote more attention to this branch. 57. The reporting of outbreaks of contagious disease still leaves much to be desired. Much time is wasted in attending belated reports and when the Assistant arrives, the disease having taken its toll is found to be dying out ; at other times the reports are found to be erroneous and no contagious disease exists. It is surprising to find how little assistance some villages will give to the Veterinary Assistant in inoculating cattle. Inoculation work if done methodically can be pushed on rapidly with plenty of assistance. But in too many cases time is wasted in trying to collect cattle, etc. Ploughing, a puja or a hât day all interfere with the work and the Assistant has to pay a second or even a third visit which should be unnecessary, Veterinary committees that are anxious to increase the scope of Veterinary work might help in solving these problems. 58. At each of the Agricultural shows at Maulvi Bazar and Nalbari a Veteri- nary stall was arranged where instruments, specimens and diagrams were on view, lectures and demonstrations were given and leaflets distributed. The people were greatly interested and the efforts of the demonstrators seems to have met with much success. It is to be hoped that more opportunities will be given in the future for such work. 59. His Excellency the Governor of Assam visited the Veterinary Hospital at Nalbari on the 16th February 1925. 60. The Hon'ble Minister of Education visited the following hospitals and dispensaries :9 TABLE II Showing number of deaths from contagions diseases amongst animals during the year 1924-1925.

PREFACE2 7. There were two stipendiaries of the Local Boards reading in the College. They were in the 3rd-year class but both of them failed to pass the Final Examination. 8. There was no private student from Assam at the College during the year. 9. In the previous year two students of this province graduated from the Bengal Veterinary College and joined the Department during the year under report. 10. One Veterinary Inspector was sent to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar for a post-graduate course of training for three months. PART II.3 23. Anthrax.4 and 18,265 animals treated for contagious diseases and 48,664 animals treated for non-contagious diseases. There was thus an increase of 408 villages visited, 232 animals castrated, 643 animals treated for contagious diseases and 2,740 animals treated for non-contagious diseases. Seven dispensaries were temporarily closed for sometime, as Reserve Assistants were not available to fill the vacancies. The work of the Assistants on tour was not inspected by the Inspectors as regularly and as often as is found necessary owing to insufficient travelling allowance allotted to the Inspectors. 35. In addition to the above the Veterinary Assistant employed by the Dhubri Local Board, visited 139 villages, and treated 148 animals for contagious diseases and 342 animals for non-contagious diseases. The Local Board engaged this Assistant on 9th September 1924 with the object of opening a dispensary on the South Bank. This has not been done. He has been placed temporarily at Dhubri. His services have not been utilised to the best advantage. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 36. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals. The total number of animals treated in hospitals during the year under report as both in and out-patients was 4,419 against 4,163 in the previous year. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for the treatment of animals not brought to the hospitals was 400 against 1,018 in 1924-25. The distribution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are encouraged to bring their animals for examination and treatment. 37. Gauhati Veterinary Hospital.5 43. A brief account of the work performed by the Veterinary Inspectors is given below:6 45. The names of the following Veterinary Assistants are noted for good and steady work:7 I cannot omit making some remarks on the great amount of cruelty which is inflicted on animals in this province. The above figures give no idea of the pain and mutilation which domestic animals have to bear; much of this is deliberately- inflicted and much is due to apathy and ignorance. To mention some of the cases which are ultimately brought to the dispensaries would be nauseating. Certain it is that it is a great disgrace on animal owners. 51. Four Veterinary Assistants were sent to the Pasteur Institute, Shillong, for anti-rabic treatment as they had been exposed to the risk of infection in the course of their duty. 52. During the year sanction was given for the distribution and use of anti- rabies vaccine outside the Pasteur Institue. For many years this boon has been desired by the Department. The first animal to undergo the treatment was a valuable bull belonging to the Agricultural Department. This animal was bitten in the muzzle, owing to this and also that some considerable time had elapsed, the intensive form of protection was adopted, i.e., a proportion of the vaccine was injected intravenously. Up to the present the bull has shown no signs of rabies. 53. As already stated Rinderpest was prevalent in a virulent form in many districts and it continued with little abatement during the cold weather which is unusual. Another unusual point was that in one district during an outbreak of Rinderpest an outbreak of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia occurred. This greatly complicated the situation and added to the work. In one garden there was a large number of pigs which took the disease (rinderpest) in a very acute form and 90 per cent. died. Amongst the cattle the disease was much less virulent. 54. An outbreak of a hitherto unknown disease causing a heavy mortality was observed in several herds of cattle on a char in the Brahmaputra. The disease was found to be due to the presence of two parasites which have not been observed previously in Assam and probably not in India. Mr. Ware of Madras kindly identified one parasite as the Eurytrema Pancreaticum which has been previously found in China and Burma. The identification of second parasite has not yet been definitely made ; it belongs to the order of Amphistoma. The symptoms of the disease are severe anæmia, emaciation and death. 55. During the year under report the Veterinary Assistants observed 153 cases of suspected poisoning amongst cattle of these 42 were reported to have died. In 5 cases, material sent to the Chemical Examiner showed poisoning by arsenic. In the previous year 232 cases were suspected to be of poisoning, of which 204 cattle died. All these cases were reported to the local authorities by the Veterinary Assistants. 56. During the year a collection of ticks were sent to the Director of Entomology, Calcutta, at his request. He reported that the collection which contained a few un- described specimens was very interesting. I might add here that the tick is generally considered a rather harmless parasite, but such is far from the actual facts. Not only is it an agent for carrying disease, but it reduces the general vitality and causes loss of condition, anæmia, reduction in the milking qualities, etc. In some countries the damage is so appreciated that dipping to eradicate the tick is compulsory and it is a punishable offence to own a tick infected animal. 57. The Hon'ble Minister of Education has taken a great interest in the work and welfare of the Department and in the course of his tours inspected the Veterinary Dispensaries at Sylhet, Maulvi Bazar, Karimganj, Habiganj, Kulaura, Sunamganj, Silchar, Tezpur, Barpeta and Nalbari. 58.

No. R1-1-1309. FROM BABU GURU PRASANNA SEN, G.B.V.C., SUPERINTENDENT IN CHARGE, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM IN THE TRANSFERRED DEPARTMENTS, SHILLONG. Dated Gauhati, the 29th June 1927. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, for the year 1926-27 together with a copy of the Report on the Veterinary Administration of the Manipur State, for the year ending the 31st March 1927. Your obedient servant, G. P. SEN, Superintendent in charge, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam.
REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERNARY DEPARTMENT, ASSAM, FOR THE YEAR 1926-27. PREFACE2 8. There was only one private student from this province in the college during the year under report. He was in the 3rd-year class and he also passed the final examination of the college. 9. In the previous year three students from this province graduated from the Bengal Veterinary College and joined the Department during the year under report. PART II.3 OTHER ANIMALS. 24. Contagious diseases amongst other animals.4 diseases. In the previous year 8,957 villages were visited, 1,162 animals castrated and 18,908 animals treated for contagious diseases and 51,404 cases for non-contagious diseases. There was thus an increase of 831 villages visited, 429 animals castrated and 9,265 treated for contagious diseases while there was a decrease of 2,139 cases treated for non-contagious diseases. In spite of the decrease in the treatment of non- contagious diseases there was an increase of 7,555 in the total number of cases dealt with by Veterinary Assistants this year. Eight dispensaries were temporarily closed for some time as Reserve Assistants were not available to fill the vacancies. The work of the Assistants on tour was inspected by the Inspectors as much as they could. 35. In addition to the above, the Veterinary Assistant employed by the Dhubri Local Board, visited 130 villages, treated 262 cases for contagious diseases and 352 cases for non-contagious diseases but no castration was performed by him. The Board entertained this Assistant in 1924 with the object of opening a dispensary on the South Bank. Up till now this has not been done. The Assistant has been posted tem- porarily at Dhubri. Such an arrangement is obviousily not the most suitable for the interests of the people of the South Bank. 36. The Reserve and Staff Veterinary Assistants on their tours treated 2,723 cases of contagious diseases, 3,121 animals of non-contagious diseases and castrated 34 animals against 1,119, 957 and 1 respectively. VETERINARY HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 37. Table V shows the work of the three Government Veterinary Hospitals. The total number of animals treated in hospitals during the year under report including both in and out-patients was 4,275 against 4,419 in the previous year. The cause of this fall is attributed to frequent visits of the Reserve and Staff Veterinary Assistants especially at Gauhati and Silchar in the town and near about where they undertook treatment at the owners' houses and the number has been shown as their own work. The total number of cases supplied with medicines for the treatment of animals not brought to the hospital was 121 against 400 in the previous year. The distribution of medicines without the cases being seen is discouraged. Owners are as usual encouraged to bring their animals to the hospitals for examination and treatment. 38.
