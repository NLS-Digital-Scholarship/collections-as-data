De), the teach- ing staff was short of one lecturer for four months during the working season. The senior lecturer (Mr. S. K. Mitra) acted as Assistant Principal in addition to his own duties. Under the circumstances, the results of the examinations reflect credit on the whole teaching staff. 2. In consequence of Mr. S. C. Pal, 2nd grade Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, taking leave for six months, Mr. D. K. Sen, a 3rd grade Deputy Superintendent, ranking as lecturer, was promoted to the 2nd grade and the Chief Glanders Inspector (Mr. J. N. Mitra) was made a 3rd grade Deputy Superintendent and posted in the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, as a temporary measure. 3. Mr. R. V. Pillai, Laboratory Assistant, secured a Deputy Superinten- dentship under the Government of the Central Provinces, and M. B. Mennon, Junior Hospital Surgeon, secured a higher appointment in the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory. THE EPIZOOTIC DISEASES OF ANIMALS DEPARTMENT IN CALCUTTA. All the stables and cattle sheds in the Calcutta glanders area were regularly inspected by the glanders staff. 2. Glanders and Farcy were detected in 30 stables and surra in two. Altogether 55 horses were seized and brought to the hospital, where, after recognised tests, 25 were destroyed (24 for Glanders and Farcy and one for Surra) and 17 died (16 from Glanders and Farcy and 1 from Surra). The remaining 13 were discharged as free from any of the diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act. 3. Rupees 160 was given as compensation for the destruction of three horses affected with glanders. 4. There were 32 outbreaks of rinderpest in the different parts of the glanders area, especially amongst the conservancy cattle of the Cossipore- Chitpur and Baranagore Municipalities and the draft cattle of the Supply and Transport Lines, Hastings, and prompt measures were adopted in each outbreak. Nine hundred and seventeen head of cattle were inoculated with protective serum against the disease. 5. While the Remount Depot was closed from 16th May to 31st December 1919, 187 horses were inspected by the glanders staff on board
4 the ship prior to their landing in Calcutta. No symptom of any contagious disease was noticed in any of them. 6. Twenty-eight inspections were made of hides exported to different foreign ports during the year. 7. At the request of the Health Officer, Calcutta Corporation, 42 calves were tested with tuberculin at the Ballygunge Vaccine Depôt. 8. A sum of Rs. 1,092-9-6 was realised on account of the price of serum, mallein and tuberculin supplied and credited to Government. 9. Two hundred and fifty sheep were examined at the Supply and Transport Lines, Hastings prior to their transport to Port Blair. RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY. The laboratory did good and useful work during the year as detailed below: (1) Brains of 126 different animals suspected to be suffering from rabies were examined, of which 96 proved to be rabies. Persons bitten by these animals were recommended anti-rabic treatment at the Pasteur Institute. (2) Two hundred and sixty three pathological specimens, chiefly received from the various districts of Bengal and Bihar and Orissa, as also from this college hospital, were examined, and 15 Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia, 1 Amphistomum Crumeniferum, 1 Black Quarter, 2 Fowl Cholera, 1 Distomum Hepaticum, 1 Demodectic Mange, 1 Heterakis Papillosa, 6 Anthrax, 2 Septicæmia, 2 Piroplasmosis, 2 Glanders, 1 Surra and 1 Strangles were diagnosed. (3) The Imperial Serologist, Calcutta, was supplied, on request, with horse and buffalo blood for his work. White mice were supplied to the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Muktesar for experimental purposes and morbid materials to other scientific workers. (4) At the request of Messrs. Landale & Clarke, Calcutta, samples of bonemeal intended for export from Calcutta were collected from the Chingri- hatta and Bengal Bone Mills and tested for anthrax and other pathogenic organisms. (5) One lakh, eighty-two thousand, five hundred and twenty-two doses of anti-rinderpest serum, 22,250 of anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum, 1,150 of anti-anthrax serum, 123 of mallein and 34 of tuberculin were supplied to Calcutta and the various districts of Bengal. (6) The college magic lantern with slides of various infectious diseases of animals and specimens of well-bred cattle, as also different sera and vaccines were sent to districts for exhibition and demonstration to the rayats at fairs and shows.

Officer in charge, duration of tour, etc. . . . . . . . . 1 PART 1.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE YEAR 1919-20. Preface and General Administration. I WAS released from military duty on the 12th April 1919 and went on privilege leave for two months and 20 days, on the expiry of which I reverted to Bengal on 17th July 1919 and relieved Colonel Smith who was in charge of the department till that date in addition to his own duties as Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College. 2. During the year I was on tour for 70 days, travelled 8,655 miles by rail, 100 by road and 855 by steamer. In the course of these tours I inspected almost all the important hospitals and dispensaries in the province and checked and supervised the work of the subordinate staff as far as possible, consulting with and advising District Officers as to the best means of improving veterinary matters in their respective districts. I also acted as Examiner at the Annual Examinations of the Bengal and Madras Veterinary Colleges which work took up the whole of March last. I personally selected and purchased at Teesta six good Siri bulls for the district of Darjeeling. My tour would have been more extensive had not my time been so fully occupied at headquarters in introducing and carrying out various methods of improvement, which were not possible of being applied during the war. Colonel Smith made no tours during the period he held charge. 3. Mr. S. C. Paul held the post of the Deputy Superintendent till 2nd January 1920 when he went on leave for six months on account of ill- health. He toured for 42 days and travelled 4,239 miles by rail, 70 by road and 215 by steamer. 4. Mr. J. N. Mitter, Chief Glanders Inspector, was appointed to act as Deputy Superintendent during the absence, on leave, of Mr. S. C. Paul. This officer also could not do much touring as he was on privilege leave for one month from 28th January 1920 on account of a severe attack of influenza. 5. The war having come to an end no more Veterinary Assistants were deputed for field service. One Veterinary Assistant, Babu N. N. Banerjee, returned from military duty in October last and was posted to the staff. The number of Veterinary Assistants away on military duty at the close of the year was six. But from information received from private sources it appears that one of them died some time ago and another has become insane. No official information was however tendered to this department about them. Part I.2 7. The newly appointed Veterinary Assistants were given practical instructions in field work as well as in office routine before being sent out to districts. Part ll.3 Table III. 22. Preventive inoculation.4 Table V. Hospitals and Dispensaries. 32. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries. There were 31 dispensaries at the close of last year and four (viz., one at Balurghat, one at Nilphamari, one at Patuakhali and one at Brahman beria) were added during the year, thus bringing the total number of such institu- tions up to 35. 33. The total number of in and out-patients treated at these dispen- saries was 44,747 as against 43,312 in the previous year. 34. The dispensary building at Bagerhat was under construction towards the end of the year, and it is expected to be opened shortly. 35. The dispensary at Noakhali will have to be removed soon to a suitable place owing to encroachment of the river Meghna. 36. The stable building attached to the dispensary at Chittagong was burnt down in August 1919, and this affected the number of in-patients to some extent. It is now being reconstructed. 37. The thatched building in which the Veterinary Dispensary at Dacca was located was blown down by the cyclone of September 1919, causing serious loss and damage to the dispensary furniture and articles. The Dis- pensary with as much material as could be saved was therefore removed to the sheds now existing on the land acquired in 1914 for the construction of a Government dispensary. The construction of this new hospital, which was deferred so long on account of the war, is expected to be taken in hand by the Public Works Department during the current year. The plans and estimates, amounting to about Rs. 23,000. have been already prepared. 38. The municipal dispensary at Naraingunge was also blown down by the cyclone. This dispensary is at present maintained by the munici- pality entirely for the treatment of their own animals. But as it is a very important place and is soon likely to become the headquarters of a district, it is essential that there should be a Station Veterinary Hospital for the treatment of animals belonging to the outside public also. I took the opportunity of advising the Municipal Board to build the new one in such a way that it might suit the purposes of both themselves and the public. I have sent them a copy of the type-plans and trust they will see their way to taking up the work at an early date. 39. Land was acquired before I went on service at Rajshahi and Pabna upon which to erect suitable dispensary buildings with accommodation for in-door patients, but unfortunately nothing was or could be done towards completion by the district boards although the establishment of Veterinary Hospitals at these places is a distinct necessity. The need for a similar hospital is being keenly felt at Berbampore, Jessore, Alipore and Darjeeling, and it is to be hoped that the district boards concerned will meet the proposals with consideration when again presented to them. 40. At Midnapore the idea of converting a portion of the old jail into a Veterinary Hospital is being given effect to now, after a lapse of some nine years since a hospital was first suggested. 41. There are proposals for constructing dispensaries with quarters for the Itinerant Veterinary Assistants at Tangail and Contai, according to the plan prepared by me for the purpose, the cost being much less than that of a regular hospital with accommodation for in-patients. The Manager of the Six-anna Estate Santosh, in the district of Mymensingh, has, at the request of the Magistrate, kindly agreed to meet the cost of erection, etc. 42. Establishment of a dispensary at Serampore is now under the con- templation of the Serampore and other five riparian municipalities. 43. A shoeing forge was added to the Chinsurah Dispensary during the year under report, and apart from teaching local farriers to do their work more carefully and with greater skill, the animals at the same time are being greatly benefited. Part III.5 these are either the property of the Local Bodies or of Government. As directed la9t year, a record is now being kept by the Veterinary Assistants of the services of the various bulls, and the result will be recorded in the report of the coming year. The bulls kept at the jails are for the purpose of the jail cattle only, although in some cases their services are allowed to the outside cattle, but the fees being charged are in most instances fairly high so that the owners but seldom take advantage of this privilege. 45. Requests for good bulls were received from several districts, but could not be complied with in all cases for want of suitable animals. Six Siri bulls were supplied to the Darjeeling district by purchasing them at Tee8ta at an average cost of Rs. 60, and one cross bull was sent to the District Board of Malda. In the latter case a bull-calf of 18 months old was purchased from the Keventer's Farm at Calcutta and sent to Malda to be retained and suitably fed, according to instructions by the district board, till it is fit for stud purposes (six months' time). The expanse of transit in this case was considerable, viz., Rs. 70 but the initial cost being small and the bull a particularly suitable one, I feel sure the Board will be amply compensated by its services when it is full grown. I intend following up this scheme of buying young bulls and having them properly cared for in the last few months of their adolescence by the district boards and hope thereby to procure more of them and improve their efficiency as stud animals. 46. Two bull-calves (cross-Montgomary) were purchased during the year by the District Board of Barisal from the local jail at an average cost of Rs. 22, and two more (one cross-Australian and one Patna) were presented to the Veterinary Hospital by two gentlemen of the town. 47. One country-bred bull-calf was presented to the District Board of Jalpaiguri by Rai Preonath Bannerjee Bahadur of Jalpaiguri. 48. Making use of cross-bred bulls in this way may be rather zig-zag breeding, but our first object must be improvement of the milk-producing and work-performing qualities rather than attempts to laying down special types or breeds in such a vast country as Bengal. These highly specialized lines can be followed only when the people themselves have become sufficient- ly civilised and educated to carry them on unceasingly, with profit to them- selves and the community at large. The possibility of creating a single type or breed of cattle which will be everlastingly and ubiquitously success- ful has yet to be revealed. The prevailing degeneracy6 51.

Table IX shows the working of the farms in the province. 53. As reported in previous years there are only two such farms in Bengal, viz., Kalimpong and Rangpur.

The number of stud bulls kept by Government and local bodies increased from 104 in the previous year to 124 in the year under report. Of these 57 are the property of local bodies. The Governor in Council notices with satisfaction that a record is now being kept by the veterinary assistants of the services of stud bulls and of their results. 7. Four new dispensaries were established during the year, thus bring- ing the total number of such institutions up to 35, whilst it is satisfactory to note that other dispensaries are under contemplation. The number of patients treated at these dispensaries was 44,747 as against 43,312 in the previous year. 8. In accordance with paragraph 8 of the resolution on the last year's report, veterinary sub-committees were appointed in some districts: the scheme will be tried throughout the province in the current year. It is hoped that the members of the sub-committees will take an active interest in the work and thus prove their utility in dealing with the veterinary work of the districts. 9. The work of the Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment Veterinary Inspectors and the staff of the Bengal Veterinary College continued to be satisfactory. His Excellency in Council has much pleasure in acknowledging the valu- able services of Colonel Smith and in recording his appreciation of the work done by Mr. A. D. MacGregor.
