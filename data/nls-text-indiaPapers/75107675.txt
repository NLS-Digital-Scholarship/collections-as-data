IP/19/H9.4 No.1346/213 FROM A. H. L. FRASER, ESQ., OFFG. ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home Department. Dated Nagpur, the 11th April 1877. SIR, I am directed to submit the reports on the working of the Lock Hospitals of Kamptee, Sitabaldi, Jubbulpore, and Saugor, for the year 1876, with minutes recorded on the Jubbulpore Report by the Magistrate of the District and Senior Medical Officer, British Troops, and a resolution passed thereon by the Committee. 2. It will be noted that, though there is slight increase noticeable in some of the figures, yet, on the whole, the results are much as last year. It would appear, however, that the disease has, in Kamptee at least, partaken of a less virulent character. The supervision and working of the hospitals has been satisfactorily carried out. But there is the same want of marked success, the same complaint of the absence of tangible results, in regard to the great object of these institutions, viz. the suppression of venereal disease amongst the troops. 3. The Chief Commissioner does not consider it necessary again to take up the subject at length, as it has been recently discussed pretty fully in this Office letter No. 1040-213, dated 22nd instant. It is enough to note how in all the reports, the great hindrance to real success is shown to be that the soldiers resort to unlicensed prostitutes. The case of Jubbulpore shows that it is not enough to forbid the soldiers to go to the town without passes. This was done by the Officer Commanding the 1-11 Regiment there; and the result was that a soldier was hardly even seen in the town. But the women came from the town to the station, and prowled about in the neighbourhood of the large " maidan" round which the Can- tonment boundary runs, and there they eluded the watch of the Police, and solicited the soldiers apparently with great success. For during the first half of the year there were not less than 89 admissions to the hospital; while from July to December there were only 23. So marked a decrease as this cannot be attributed to chance, or to the ordinary fluctuations in immorality or in the diseases them- selves, and there seems no other explanation for it than this, that partly owing to the prevalence of cholera causing an emphatic check to be put on general communi- cation between the city and station or cantonment, partly owing to the rains rendering it inconvenient for them to go so far to ply their trade, the women of the city did not come to cantonments ; and the soldiers had to resort to the registered women of the Sudder Bazaar. It is certainly partly due to this cause. It would appear then, that more stringent measures for the protection of the soldiers are
2 required than even those prudently adopted by Colonel Roe. Some of the reports call for strong repressive measures to be directed against unregistered prostitutes. Others for penalties on soldiers infected by such women. Both courses might probably with advantage be resorted to. But the Chief Commissioner's views on this point have been already fully expressed in the letter above quoted. 4. Without further remark, I am therefore to forward the annual reports. OT I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. H. L. FRASER, Offg. Asst. Secretary.

Playfair, Cantonment Magistrate, Kamptee, to the Secre- tary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,10 A. Statement showing the admissions from Primary Syphilis and Gonorrh11 No changes of any consequence have taken place in the subordinate medi- cal and Hospital establishment. The duties have, as a rule, been satisfactorily performed by all, though in one or two instances it has been necessary to inflict fines, and to reprimand the Hospital servants for direlictions of duty. Hospital Assistant Janakuram Pillay has always done his work efficiently and zealously. 3. The extent of venereal disease amongst European Troops. Weekly and monthly returns have been regularly furnished by the senior Medical officer, British Troops, showing the admissions from venereal disease, and the following general state ment has been compiled from these returns :12 it is to be borne in mind that the average strength of the force during 1876 was only 917.3, whereas in 1875 it amounted to 1024.41. An inspection of the return also shows some diminution in the number of admissions from primary syphilis, the number in 1875 being 65, and in 1876 only 56. The most marked difference between the returns for the two years is under the heading of secon- dary syphilis, the number of cases of which amounted to 66 in 1875, and only 18 in 1876. This is highly satisfactory, indicating, as it must be admitted to do, that the type of disease is of a mild character, instead of being marked by the virulence which is so frequently displayed in syphilitic disease contracted by Europeans from women of the coloured races. The returns so far cannot, I think, be considered unsatisfactoy but it is to be regretted that the same remark does not apply to the admissions from gonorrh13 Senior Medical Officer British Troops, and it is very remarkable that the men very rarely point out any clandestine prostitutes as having diseased them, while they do not appear to have any hesitation in reporting a registered woman, and most frequently in the latter case the woman is found free from disease. On the 4th of September, the Lal bazar, in which the whole of the 1st class prostitutes lived together, was completely washed away, and since then it has not been possible to exercise the same supervision over the women who are now mixed up with the rest of the people. It has been recommended that the Lal bazar should be rebuilt with as little delay as possible, but this has not yet been done. 3 women were removed from the register, as being too old and worn out to ply their trade. 7. Whether registration fees have been levied, &c. No registration fees have been levied. 8. Whether the women have been regular, &c. The average number of women attending at the periodical examinations during the past year was 47.67, while the average number of sick in hospital was 14.37 ; besides the lat- ter a considerable number were excused from attend- ance on account of non-venereal affections, The latter were either visited at their houses by the Hospital Assistant, or made to produce certificates of attendance at the Civil Dispensary. The number of women reported to the Magistrate for non-attendance was 92, of whom 32 were punished by fine, and 1 by imprisonment. The amount realized by these fines was Rs. 19, besides Rs. 9-4-0 levied from 9 of the clandes- tine prostitutes brought before the Magistrate by the Police. 9. Arrangements for examin- ing and treating, &c. The 1st class prostitutes were examined on Monday, and the 2nd class on Saturday throughout the year, and Wednesday was devoted to the examination of the women in hospital ; besides this, the chowdran was employed daily in visit- ing the 1st class prostitutes at their houses, and examining them for disease which she several times detected. This duty she has not been able to carry on efficiently, since the women were scattered, in consequence of the destruction of their houses. The Hospital Assistant has also examined the patients in Hospital daily and applied the necessary remedies. 10. How far disease has in- creased among the women. The number of admissions from primary syphilis during the past year among the registered prostitutes was 50 against 72 in 1875. The sores have all been of the soft kind, and no distinctly marked Hunterian chancre has been. met with. In comparing the returns for the Lock Hospital for the last two years, it is to be observed that in 1875, sores were described as syphilis primary, ulcers of os uteri and ulcers vagina ; whereas in 1876 Dr. Smith abolished these dis- tinctions, and entered all sores on the genitals as syphilis primary. This was, I think, a wise measure, as the sores, however described were of a venereal character. The same remark applies to the admissions for discharge from the genitals, which, in 1875, were divided into the headings of gonorrh14 innocent was, therefore,. only calculated to mislead.

The average number was 104 against 108 for the year preceding. It is better in Cantonment, but worse in the City. 10. The total number of women admitted into Hospital was 171 against 182 for the year preceding. The nature of the diseases is about the same, arid is set forth in sufficient detail in Statement No. 2 which accompanies this report. 11. The Dhaies continue to give satisfaction ; they performed their duties effici- ently in every respect. The Hospital Assistant Golam Akbar is a very good hardworking subordi- nate. 12. Cost of maintenance has been Rs. 2,086 against Rs. 2,007 for the year pre- ceding, due to increased cost of diet consequent on the increased number daily under treatment, namely 17 against 15. There is nothing in the items of expenditure calling for remark, they were all ordinary and according to routine. Memo, by Major H. C. E.

FRASER, ESQUIRE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER., Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home Department, Dated Nagpur, the 8th May 1878. SIR, I am directed by the Chief Commissioner to submit the reports on the working of the Lock Hospitals of Kamptee, Sitabaldi, Pachmarhi, Jubbulpore and Saugor for the year 1877, with a few accompanying papers. *No. 357, dated 21st December.1877. 2. In a recent Resolution, * the Government of India in the Home De- partment recorded various remarks and suggestions regarding the administration of Lock Hospitals and the prevention of venereal disease in India; and this resolution further invited suggestions and expression of opinion on the part of Local Governments and Administrations. It is the intention of the Chief Commissioner, on receipt of replies from the officers whom he has deemed it expedient to consult, to submit a full expression of his views on the subjects mooted. It is unnecessary therefore to deal with them in this place. 3. There is nothing very striking in the figures for the year under report. The cost of the various institutions is much the same as last year ; and the statistics of their working do not show any marked change, though they are on the whole more favourable. There is a decrease in venereal admissions reported from Kamptee : especially marked in the case of secondary syphilis. This shows that the type of the disease is milder than formerly; and that the improvement of last year has continued. The decrease in the number of admis- sions at Jubbulpore, and the prevalence of a milder type of the disease there, are attributed by Dr. Rice to the fact that during their first year of occupancy, regimental prostitution is chiefly confined to the women on the register ; as the acquaintance of the soldiers does not extend further. This statement is said to be based on the experience of several years, and may perhaps have some foun- dation in fact ; though it would probably not be safe to adopt the conclusion hastily. In Saugor the figures are not so favourable ; but it is clear that this result is partly at least due to the fact that the 2-1 Royal Scots contracted a good deal of disease on their way from Lahore to Saugor. 4. Unlicensed prostitution seems still to prevail to a large extent. This is represented as partly due to defective registration, to want of vigilance on the part of the police &c. The Cantonment Magistrate of Saugor points out that the power of the civil police to prevent it is greatly limited by their fear of the European soldiers, with whom they run no little risk of collision, when they attempt to arrest women illegally plying their trade ; and there is little doubt that -much must be left to the Regimental police. The employment of female punkah pullers and coolies is unfavourably commented on by Surgeon Major Suffrein of Kamptee. At Saugor the precaution of employing males only on public works in connection with or in the vicinity of the barracks has been adopted. The question resolves itself mainly into one of expense, and as Saugor is a military works charge, the military authorities have probably
2 decided that the extra expense is one well worth incurring. Whether female punkah coolies should be employed in barracks is also a matter for depart- mental consideration. 5. The difficulties in the way of detecting unlicensed prostitutes are again noticed. Soldiers cannot be induced to betray the unlicensed women from whom they have contracted disease. They have frequently, at Jubbulpore and elsewhere, been found rather to seek to screen them by blaming women whose names are on the register, and who on examination are found to be quite free from disease. All this would seem to indicate that it may yet be found necessary to adopt in India some of the repressive measures against the soldier himself (such as hospital stoppages, &c.) which are adopted elsewhere. 6. The advantage of regular examination has been illustrated at Kamptee by the experience of the last three months of the year, the less satisfactory results recorded during that period being attributed to the women having absented themselves from examination. This is a matter which it is not difficult to deal with, and more attention has been promised to it. 7. In conclusion then it seems to the Chief Commissioner that all that it is possible to assert is that the figures of 1877 show that Lock Hospitals have continued to mitigate the severity of venereal disease. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, A, H. L. FRASER, Asst. Secretary.
REPORT ON THE LOCK HOSPITAL, KAMPTEE, 1877. From Major. W. Vertue, Secretary to the Cantonment Committee, Kamptee, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,2 Annual Report on the Kamptee Lock Hospital for the year 1877, by B. T. Suffrien, Surgeon Major, 2nd Light Cavalry, in Medical charge of Lock Hospital. 1. The nature and extent of hospital accommodation, &c. The nature and extent of the hospital accommodation have been so fre- quently and fully described in previous reports that it is only necessary now to state that the wards are lofty and well ventilated, and that the buildings are, in every respect, well suited for their purpose. During the past year the roofs of the store and cook-rooms, and of the additional back verandah, were repaired. Deep drains were dug around the boundary walls of the buildings to carry off the surplus water during the rains ; the channels opening into an adjacent nala, Shelves were fixed to the walls of the surgery and store-room. The insides of the walls of the wards were washed with light buff-colored lime wash to soften the light, and other minor repairs and improvements were executed. 3. Any change in the medical charge of the Lock hospital. I have been in charge of the institution during the whole of the period under report, with the exception of 36 days, extend- ing from the 1st October to the 5th November, during which time Surgeon P. H. Esmonde White, 35th Regiment, M. N. I, officiated for me. 2. The extent of venereal disease amongst European troops. The prescribed weekly and monthly returns, showing the admissions among European soldiers, have been regularly furnished by the Senior Medical Officer, British Troops, and the following tabular Statement has been compiled from these returns :3 Making due allowance for the diminution in the average strength of the European force at Kamptee during the past, as compared with the previous year, this statement shows a very considerable decrease in the number of admis- sions among Europeans for venereal disease. This decrease is observable under all three headings of primary, syphilis, secondary syphilis, and gonorrh4 3 among 2nd class women has taken place during the past year. The num- ber of 1st class women in 1876 was 38, and in 1877, 44 ; while the 2nd class women numbered 2.7 in the former and 30 in the latter year.. In 1876 the number of women of both classes who removed their names from the register, died or absconded, was 28, and in 1877 only 19. I have already stated my belief that clandestine prostitution is carried on to a great extent in Kamptee, and as only 12 women out of 17 charged with this offence by the Police, were convicted and brought on the register, this evil cannot be regarded as being more than very slightly checked. The increased activity of Police supervision and vigilance has, however, I believe, done some good in this respect. 7. Whether registration fees have been levied, &c. No registration fees have been levied. 8. Whether the women have been regular, &c. The women have been more regular in their attendance than in 1876, the number reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non-attendance being only 67 against 92 in the former year. Of the 67 so sent up, 29 were punished by fine, and the rest discharged on explaining their absence to the satisfaction of the Cantonment Magistrate, some of them being warned not to offend again in like manner. The amount realized by fines was Rs. 21. 9. Arrangements for examin- ing and treating, &c. As in previous years, Monday was set apart for the examination of the 1st class women, Wednesday for that of the in-patients, and Saturday for that of the 2nd class women. The choudran continued to visit the 1st class prostitutes at their houses daily, but without reporting any of them to be diseased. The Hospital Assistant, Janakeeram Pillay, who is a most efficient and zealous member of the establishment, also examined the women in hospital on the intermediate days and applied the remedies prescribed. 10. How far disease has in- creased among the women. Under the heading of primary syphilis, a large decrease has taken place in the number of admissions among the registered women ; but the admissions for gonorrh[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 75109567.tif]

All of these women were registered prostitutes, and were apparently reported by the men to screen their clandestine paramours. As I remarked last year, no instance occurred in 1877 of a soldier accusing an unregistered prostitute of diseasing him ; yet nearly all the women brought up for clandestine prostitution were found diseased, and many of these women were known to have consorted with European soldiers. 11. How far Dhaies have been employed. The Dhaie, as already stated, visited the 1st class women daily at their houses since the new Lan bazar, in which all of these women live, was re-built ; but she has not reported any cases of venereal disease. 12. Any information on other matters. In conclusion, I beg to reiterate my suggestion of last year respecting increased vigilance in the supervision of all the lower classes of native females employed in and about the European barracks, and I would further suggest that, so far as this may be found practicable, male punkah pullers and coolies should be employed in the place of women. I would also venture to suggest the advisability of the fines levied on women for non-attendance at examinations being enforced in all cases, where their reasons for non-attendance are not thoroughly satisfactory ; and I do so, because the women have latterly shown a disposition to absent themselves from these examinations, and in several instances women who have so absented themselves, have been found diseased at a subsequent examination.

9 REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, SITABALDI. From J. W. Neill, Esquire, Officiating Commissioner, Nagpur Division, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Gentral Provinces,10 Measures for the control of prostitution. The only measures for the control of prostitution are registration and examination of women. Registration how far extended. Only those women frequented by European soldiers are supposed to be on the register. It extends over an area of 5 miles round cantonment. Three women have been brought on the register during the year. Registration fees. No registration fee has been levied. Attendance of the women at inspections. Summonses are signed by me on every Saturday and served by the Police to each woman, ordering her to appear for examination on the following Wednesday morning. A report is sent weekly to the Deputy Commissioner showing what women have attended, are found diseased, or have absented themselves. The attendance of the women on the whole has been regular during the year. The number reported for non-attendance has been 129.60. The number found diseased has been 58. Some of the women were fined and some have been imprisoned by the Deputy Commissioner for non-attendance. Area embraced by registration. No examinations are made in the City. Only the registered prostitutes are subject to examination weekly at the Lock Hospital. They are examined in my presence with the speculum, one after another, in the surgery by the Hospital Assistant assisted by the female cooly. The instruments after having been used are washed and disin- fected with Condy's fluid at each time. Any woman found to have venereal affec- tions is kept in hospital for treatment. Type of diseases among the women. There have been 58 admissions during the year, viz., primary syphilis 2, gonorrhoea 47, ulcer of uterus 8, odema of labia 1. There has been no admission for secondary syphilis. This must be considered a proof of the mildness of the type. The average daily number of sick has been 1.34. Among the men there were 7 primary syphilis, 2 secondary syphilis and 5 gonorrh11 Lock Hospital Sitabaldi. STRENGTH OF PROSTITUTES.

17 REPORT ON THE LOOK HOSPITAL, SAUGOR, 1877. From Major W. L, Noverre, Cantonment Magistrate, Saugor, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,-No. 273, dated Saugor, 1st March 1877. I have the honor to forward the Medical Officer's annual report on the Saugor Lock Hospital for 1877. " Attendance at inspection." 2. The attendance at inspections has been satisfactory, only 20 women having been absent during the year, and none of these were found on inspection to be diseased. " Amount of disease during the year and causes of preva- lence." 3. The total number of women admitted to hospital is rather greater than last year, being 114 against 103 in the year 1876. The increase is however due to the increased number (11 cases) of leucorrh18 tion of married men in Saugor and surrounding villages, and for the fact that the men of both the native regiments have their families with them in the lines. There are no doubt more than 58 women in Saugor who support themselves by prostitution, but they contrive to arrange matters in such a way that the Police cannot obtain sufficient evidence against them to secure their registration ; such women are not common prostitutes, and are in no case accessible to European soldiers. " Suggestions for checking the disease." 5. With regard to the suggestions made in my letter covering the report for last year, I may note that arrangements have been made to detain in hospital all women who are unfit for examination owing to menstruation, also for conveying women suffering from illness, other than venereal, to the hospital that they may not escape examination. Additional precautions have been taken to prevent patients from leaving the precincts of the hospital ; and the Executive Engineer, Military Works, has been requested to put a stop to the employment of women on the barracks, and on works in their vicinity. The report now submitted shows that notwithstanding the increased care that has been taken, the disease amongst the men has increased, and this is clearly traced to the existence of unlicensed prostitutes, not women residing in the city or bazars, but women who ply their trade out of doors after dark in the vicinity of the barracks. It is found impossible to put a stop to this practice through the Civil Police, who are afraid to interfere with the men ; the women when detected can only be pun- ished with imprisonment for 8 days, and this has no deterrent effect on them. Commanding Officers might, I think, do more through their Regimental Police, and I believe that a system of rewards for the detection of unlicensed women who prowl about the barracks soliciting soldiers, would assist in their sup- pression.

The accommodation is sufficient, there being beds for 20 patients. The hospital has been lime-washed, a gate for entrance sup- plied, and some repairs executed. The Native Doctor resides in the compound, suitable accommodation having been prepared for him. The hospital and compound are in good sanitary con- dition.

36 Copy of remarks made by Deputy Commissioner on the Lock Hospital Report for the year 1877. The difficulty of registering women is great. I have done what I can during the last 6 months to bring some women in the City under registration, but they generally leave the place a few days after they have been called up, and return when they think the Police have forgotten them. The subject will receive persis- tent attention. The expenses are high, and I think Government should bear a larger share of them; it is hard that Cantonment and Municipal Funds should contribute so much as they do.

During the first two months of the year under review the station was occupied by the 2nd Battalion 11th Regiment, but no records are available to show the amount of venereal disease which existed during that time, so that this report only comprises a period of ten months, that is from 1st March, the date on which the 2nd Battalion " The Royal Scots " arrived in the station.

In the annexed Statement the figures for the two years 1877 and 1878 have been placed together for all lock hospitals in the Central Provinces,and the results are surprising, but not more so as regards the Central Provinces than the results for the whole of the Bengal Presidency were shown to be in the exhaustive note of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, which was published with Home Department Resolution No. 15-337-43, dated 14th October last. 3. There are 5 lock hospitals in the Central Provinces, at which in 1878 252 women on an average were borne on the Registers, in which 487 cases of .disease were treated, and Rs. 9,309 were spent. The attendance of women at the periodical examinations is a point greatly insisted on by the Government of India, and out of an average of 252 women on the register 181 was the average number that attended the periodical (weekly) examinations. The average seems a fair one, and it would be even better but for the bad figures at Sitabaldi. 4. Regarding the attendance of women, the Medical Officers write thus:2 As the amount of such fines was at Jubbulpore only Rs. 16-8-0 it must be inferred either that the non-attending women did in the majority of Cases supply some reasonable explanation for their absence or that the Cantonment Magistrate fined them in very small sums. 5. The fines levied are indeed in every place insignificant, and it seems to the Chief Commissioner as if Cantonment Magistrates and other officers did not sufficiently realize the need for forcing the women to be punctual in attendance. 6. In respect to sickness among the women there seems some diversity of procedure among medical men. The Chief Commissioner assumes that for Lock Hospital purposes only the treatment of venereal diseases should be shown in the returns. At Kamptee, Sitabaldi and Saugor this rule is observed, and the women were treated for gonorrh3 As regards the diminution of veneral disease among the troops it cannot. then be said that the results of the year are encouraging and evince that the lock hospitals are working in an efficient way. 8. The Chief Commissioner does not propose to examine the question whether the types of disease amongst the troops resemble those amongst the women. From extracts already given it will be seen that in the present as in past years it is not the registered prostitutes but the chance prostitutes who are sources of danger to the troops. And the Chief Commissioner has already expressed* his views as to the measures he would recommend for the prevention of illicit pros- titution and the more efficient working generally of the Lock Hospital system. 9.

The Lock Hospital is a hut with a bamboo enclosure in front situated near the Chakla* and about 400 yards to west of the Cantonment bazaar ; it is suitable and affords accommodation for six patients. The arrangement for cooking is unsatisfactory, the women at present having to cook in the hospital itself ; if a hut or shed could be. erected for this purpose it .would be an improve- ment in my opinion. Also a hut for the Dai2 12. I have no suggestions to offer for the improvement of the Lock Hos- pital rules, but I venture to make a few remarks. On all occasions of disease occurring amongst the Troops, the men were made to point out the women, who were immediately examined and invariably taken into hospital ; even when nothing wrong at the time could be detected, they were detained for a day or two under observation. In some instances an attack of gonorrhoea could not be traced to the registered prostitutes ; and once the Medical officer in charge of the Depot per- sonally satisfied himself of the fact. It seems to me that the men do not at all times adhere to the truth, and have no diffidence in attaching blame to the registered prostitutes with whom they have had no intercourse, and thus frus- trate one's endeavours to get at the source of the disease; and considering suspi- cious ayahs and other native women of doubtful virtue the registration was fairly efficient ; and the admissions for venereal diseases amongst the European Troops were less as compared with last year ; and although the Police were put on the alert several times no case of illicit prostitution was brought to notice.

From C. Imrie, Esq., Secretary to the Cantonment Fund Committee, Saugor, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Gentral Provinces, Nagpur,7 In the Battery of Artillery I regret to say that venereal disease has increased to a considerable extent during the same period. Out of a strength of 150 men there were 63 cases or 420 per thousand. The detail of forms of the disease is as follows: gonorrh8 There can hardly be a doubt, I think, that the Civil Police screen these women also, for in their daily and nightly rounds they must frequently come in contact with them. Still out of the 32 women who were admitted on the regis- ter, only 4 were brought forward by the Police, and in two of these instances I reported that the women were practising their trade in certain places, and the Police were thus compelled to seize the women.

As I have been out in camp the greater part of the time I have been in Office (since 8th November) I have had little or no means of judging of the working of the rules. But I am aware that it is difficult to get the women to register themselves. One or two cases which have come before me have shown this. I certainly think that the allowance of Rs. 50 paid to the Medical Officer might be paid by Government as is done in Charitable dispensaries. As the object of the Lock Hospital is to benefit British soldiers it would seem but reasonable that Government should bear the greater part of the cost. The 7th February 1879. E. M. PLAYFAIR, Deputy Commissioner, Jubbulpore. The increase in venereal diseases among the European troops at this station during the year under review as compared with last year is very marked. In 1877 14.61 per cent suffered, whereas in 1878 the percentage was 29.61 or more than double. I quite agree with the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital that this increase is not due to the condition of the registered prostitutes but to the unregistered women both in the City and in Cantonments to whom the soldiers have access. That placing the City out of bounds would have a salutary affect, I believe; as unless I am much mistaken, there was a marked decrease in the number of admissions for venereal disease during the time the troops were prohibited from entering the City on account of cholera. The means for preventing the men associating with unregistered women in Cantonments would appear to be more in the hands of the Regimental authori- ties than within the scope of any recommendations the Lock Hospital Committee could make. The localities which these women frequent are pretty well known, and it might be feasible for the Military police or patrols to prevent intercourse between them and soldiers. 24th January 1879 AUSTIN J. FERGUSSON, SURGEON MAJOR, Senior Medical Officer, B. F., Jubbulpore. 4-3-79IP|19|HG.4 No. 1804/93 FROM A. H. L. FRASER, ESQ., ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home, Revenue and Agricultural Department. Dated Nagpur, the 14th May 1880, SIR, I am directed to submit the reports on the Lock Hospitals of Saugor, Kamptee, Jubbulpore and Pachmarhi with accompanying statements and subsi- diary documents. 2. A report on the Sitabaldi Health Post by the Medical officer who held charge of it from the 1st of January to the 15th of August 1879 is also submit- ted. As that institution was found to be completely inefficient and useless for purposes of protection, it was abolished with effect from the latter date, in accordance with the orders communicated to the Chief Commissioner in a letter No. 1006S-C. dated 15th July last, from the Secretary to the Government of India (Military Department). It is therefore unnecessary to do more than submit the brief report and statements regarding it. 3. I am to append a statement in which the figures for all lock hospitals for 1878 and 1879 are placed together for facility of comparison. In comparing the figures now given for 1878 with those given last year, it must be borne in mind that the statistics for the Sitabaldi Health Post are now excluded. 4. It will be observed that the average number of prostitutes on the regis- ter has decreased; and in regard to this, the medical officers of Saugor and Kamptee complain that registration is not very efficient. The Cantonment Magistrate of .Kamptee maintains, with some show of reason, that the Canton- ment police cannot be exclusively blamed for this. It is impossible for the Chief Commissioner to say how far the regimental authorities failed, as is alleged, to co-operate with the police in restraining unlicensed prostitution; but there seems some ground for believing that (as remarked regarding the 33rd Regiment by the medical officer in charge of the lock hospital at Kamptee) "regimental supervi- " sion cannot have been very strict." But without energetic co-operation on the part of the regimental authorities, the Cantonment police cannot be expected to do successful work. 5. The Chief Commissioner observes that the subject of the non-employ- ment of female labourers about barracks has received due attention at Kamptee. This has a very important bearing on the efficiency of the preventive measures taken in connection with lock hospitals against venereal disease. The attend- ance of the registered women at the periodical examinations appears to have been fairly good. All the medical officers report favourably on this point. It will also be observed that the number of admissions of diseased women for treatment in the hospitals has every where decreased, and that the diseases under which they suffered were generally of a mild type. 6. It is satisfactory to find that a very decided decrease of venereal dis- eases among the troops has been recorded at Saugor, Jubbulpore and Pachmarhi and the types of disease are generally mild. At Kamptee an increase is shown;
2 but if the number of cases of disease contracted at other stations .(which were not formerly included in the returns) be excluded, a slight decrease is shown. The comparative prevalence of these diseases, however, and their comparative severity among the troops at Kamptee, when viewed in connection with the sta- tistics regarding the women there, seem very strongly to indicate the excep- tional frequency of clandestine prostitution at that station, and the necessity for more vigorous repression. The Chief Commissioner does not fail to observe the opinion recorded by Dr. Barrow, Senior Medical Officer, British Troops, Nagpur Force, on the inexpediency of having abolished the Health Post at Sitabaldi, and on the effect of that measure on the health of Kamptee; but he does not consider it necessary to revive here the discussion of that subject, which was fully considered in the correspondence ending with the letter of the Secretary to Government in the Military Department already referred to. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. H. L. FRASER, Asst. Secretary.

From Major R. M. B. Thomas,Secretary to the Cantonment Committee, Kamptee, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,15 Remarks by the Executive Engineer, Kanhan Division. Refering to the report of the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital (paragraphs 3 and 12) and the orders given to undersigned by the Brigadier General Commanding the Nagpur Force in which he prohibits the employment of female laborers in the construction of buildings in the lines of the British Regiments, the undersigned will take every precaution possible to prevent women coolies being employed in future. In the late reconstruction of No. 7 Barrack, Infantry lines, endeavours have been made to get rid of women coolies, but these have not been altogether successful. Hereafter it will be distinctly stipulated in arranging all petty contracts for works, that none but male laborers are to be employed, and should this tend to enhance labor rates (a result which the undersigned does not antici- pate, as boys can be employed in larger numbers on works instead of women coolies) a reference will be made in the matter to the Chief Engineer for orders. KAMPTEE. The 24th January 1880. J. H. WILSON, Executive Engineer, Kanhan Division. Remarks on the foregoing by the Senior Medical Officer, British Troops. With reference to the accompanying Annual Lock Hospital Report for 1879, and the remarks thereon by Brigadier General DeBerry, Commanding Nagpur Force, I have the honor to concur with the views expressed on the following points:16 Before submitting the Lock Hospital report and its accompaniments, I would take the opportunity of recording the following few remarks:17 Annual Report on the Kamptee Lock Hospital for the year 1879, by B. T. Sufferin Surgeon Major, 2nd Light Cavalry, in Medical charge of Lock Hospital. 1.18 obtaining sufficient evidence against a suspected woman to justify the Canton- ment Magistrate in bringing her on the register, but I think that the Police might detect more women, if they were more zealous in their endeavours. I advance this opinion not merely as a conjecture, but because I observe that whenever owing to an increase of disease, the police are urged to greater exer- tions, the result is almost invariably the capture of one or more women who are almost always found to be diseased. The Regimental Police have orders to pre- vent women from frequenting lines; but the recent detection of a bad case of disease in a woman acting as servant to a Sergeant of the 33rd, and who has been in his service for a long while, shows that Regimental supervision cannot have been very strict. No women have been captured by Regimental Police.

Many of those admitted have shown very little disease; and have been taken under treatment more as a precautionary measure, I have long been of opinion that the mass of the venereal diseases amongst the troops at this station has been contracted from women who are not on the register and who keep clear of detection in the city and elsewhere.

SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To The SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Home, Revenue and Agricultural Department, Dated. Nagpur, the 12th April 1881. SIR, I am directed to submit the reports on the working of the Lock Hospitals of Kamptee, Saugor, Jubbulpore and Pachmarhi during the year 1880, with their accompanying Statements. 2, To facilitate comparison a statement is appended showing in a collated form the returns of these four institutions for 1879 and 1880. 3. It will be observed that there has been a slight increase in the average number of prostitutes on the registers; and in the average number who attended for periodical inspection ; that the total number reported to Cantonment Magis trates has considerably decreased ; that the number found diseased and admitted to hospital has slightly increased ; and that the aggregate expenditure has been reduced by Rs. 450. 4. The registration of women practising prostitution appears to be less efficient than it might be at Kamptee, Sangor and Jubbulpore. The difficulty of getting men to point out the women from whom they may have contracted- venereal disease is notorious, and is borne out by the experience of the officers in medical charge of the Saugor, Pachmarhi and Kamptee, Lock Hospitals. It avails little that admissions to hospital of registered women decrease in number, if, as at Jubbulpore, a diminution of disease in the women co-exist with an increase of venereal disease among the British troops. The conclusion that in a large number of these cases the disease was contracted from unregistered women is irresistible, and under these circumstances the remedy appears to the Chief Commissioner to rest mainly with the Military authorities, who by closer super vision of their men may assist the Police in reporting the practise of unregistered prostitution. 5. It is satisfactory to note that the aggregate amount of venereal disease among the British troops at Kamptee was less in 1880 than in the preceding year, and that the cases were of a milder character. Even allowing for the reduced strength of the troops in the latter year, the percentage of admissions to hospital for venereal affections fell from 179 to 162 per 1,000 of strength for period of occupation. A similar result was apparent also atSaugor. There was a slight increase in the number of cases treated at Jubbulpore, mainly due apparently to the presence of the 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers amongst whom almost twice as many admissions occurred during their three months' occupation as had taken place in the 2-1st Royal Scots during the pre ceding nine months of the year.There was an increase in admissions for venereal disease to Pachmarhi Lock Hospital, but in a large majority of the cases the disease was imported and not contracted locally. The Chief Commissioner notes with satisfaction that' the exclusion of female labourers from barracks still receives attention. Their admission is doubtless a fertile source of disease. The small number of registered prostitutes as compared with the large civil population resident near the cantonments of Jubbulpore, Saugor and Kamptee is of itself sufficient to prove that the registration of professional prostitutes is incomplete. It is on this point that efforts appear most necessary and that the co-opera tion of the Military and Cantonment Police may be expected to produce bene ficial results. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, F. C. BERRY, Offg. Asst. Secretary.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PACHMARHI LOCK HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1880. The Lock Hospital is a hut with a bamboo matting enclosure, situated near the Chuckla, and about 400 yards to the west of the Sudder Bazaar. It afforded sufficient accommodation for 6 patients, but being in a very dilapidated condi- tion from the very heavy rainy season, and the site on which it was built being on a slope, it, the hospital, became quite uninhabitable both during and after the rains. It was therefore proposed to change the site and to build on a point imme- diately in the right rear of the Chuckla on a mound or hillock which, for sanitary reasons, is far preferable to the site now occupied ; and again the old hospital was considered much too large, as the greatest average of patients never exceeded 4 in hospital at a time. 2. Medical charge of the Lock Hospital was handed over to me by Assist- ant Apothecary W. Weston on the 1st December 1879. 3. There were 44 admissions during the year from venereal disease. In 21 cases the disease was contracted on the plains, and the cases admitted on arrival here. Most, or I might say all, were detected on medical inspection on the day of arrival of the diseased men. Nine cases were re-admissions from gleet, making a total of 30 from the plains ; and in the remaining 14 cases the disease was contracted here. These were trivial cases of local venereal ulcers and gonorrh2 11. The present Dhai is attentive to her duties, and. has been found very useful. There have been two changes in the matronship during the year in conse- quence of carelessness and neglect of their duties on the part of the matrons. 12. The suggestions relative to the Lock hospital at this station, have been a new hospital, and repair to the huts in the Chuckla: The first has been taken in hand and is nearly finished ; and the second is in contemplation, the expenses being met by the Cantonment funds. Relative to the prostitutes, I would suggest that half a dozen more women, younger, and of more prepossessing appearances than those at present in the station, be sent from Jubbulpore and surrounding districts as a preventive to the men frequenting the jungles in preference to the Chuckla. This last sugges- tion I have previously mentioned in one or two of my monthly reports. J. WALKER, Assistant Apothecary, In Medical charge Lock Hospital, Pachmarhi.

15 Registration extends over an area of 4 miles. There are two classes of women on the register, viz., First class for Euro- peans, and Second class for natives. An increase Óf 6 in the number has taken place during the year under report; 15 women having been brought on the regis- ter, and only 9, names removed. The close proximity of a large town to a Can- tonment renders it comparatively easy for men to consort with unregistered women who cannot be detected, unless the men will point them out. During the past year, 2 women have presented themselves voluntarily for registration, and 9 have been convicted by the Cantonment Magistrate of carrying on clandestine prostitution, and placed on the register. 7. Whether Registration fees have been levied, &c. No Registration fees have been levied. 8. Whether the women have been regular, &c. The women have as a rule been regular in their attendance at the weekly examinations. During the year, 17 registered women were fined by the Cantonment Magistrate for breaches of Lock Hospital rules, and chiefly for absenting them- selves from examination; the amount of the fines varying from Rs. 1 to Rs. 2, and the total amount realized being Rs. 29. Besides this, fines to the amount of Rs. 9 were levied on clandestine prostitutes on conviction. 9. Arrangements for examin- ing and treating, &c. The registered women of each class attend once a week, viz., those of the First class on Monday, and those of the Second class on Sa- turday, for examination by the Medical Officer. Women reporting sick are visited at their houses and examined carefully by the Hospital Assistant. 10. How far disease has in- creased among the women. The total number of admissions among the registered women during the past year was considerably less than in 1879; the num- bers being for 1879, 114, and in 1880, only 91. As among the soldiers, the decrease has been chiefly under the head of syphilis primary, the admissions for which numbered 20 in 1880. against 39 in 1879. The type of disease has been almost invariably mild, and the sores of the soft kind; and virulent cases, and hard sores have, I believe, been equally exceptional among the men. Three women were admitted for non-venereal affection, viz. ulceration of the os utiri; and all, who were found to be menstruating on examination days, were detained, until the discharge had ceased. The chart appended shows the rise and fall of both syphilis primary and gonorrhoea among the troops and registered women. 11. How far Dhais have been employed. The Chowdran or Dhai has visited the women at their own houses as usual throughout the year, and she also assists at the weekly examinations at the hospital. 12. Any information on other matters. The results of the working of the institution during the past year appear to me to be very encouraging, and I hope they will lead to further exertions on the part of the police to bring all women practising prostitution within the limits of the Cantonment under the notice of the Cantonment Magistrate, and endeavour to get them put on the register, and so still further reduce the dangerous element of clandestine pros- titution. The Hospital Assistant P. Janakuram Pillay has worked zealously and assisted me well in the management of the institution. The Dhai and all of the other servants have conducted themselves well.
16 I coincide with Surgeon Major Suffrein ; the work done with regard to the Lock Hospital at Kamptee has been much more satisfactory than heretofore. Many of the cases of venereal have, I feel assured, been contracted at Sita- baldi, where there is no Lock Hospital. The military (Europeans) stationed at Sitabaldi is changed every month, and thus the station of Kamptee is made responsible often for cases of disease contracted at a place not brought under the Act.

20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, JUBBULPORE, FOR 1880. From Major. W. L. Noverre, Cantonment Magistrate, Jubbulpore, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,21 officer in charge which has been so frequently made before, that the venereal diseases from which the British Troops have suffered, are chiefly contracted from "unregistered women," and that the disease in my opinion might be entirely stopped if sufficient energy were displayed by those to whom the duty is dele- gated of detecting this kind of prostitution. Annual Report of the Lock Hospital Jubbulpore for the year 1880. No. I. The accommodation is the same as last year, and the building is in a good state of repair. No. II. The charge of this hospital has been held by five Medical officers dur- ing the year under review, as follows : Surgeon Major Alexander, M. D. from 1st January to 15th April, Surgeon Major Sanderson from 16th April to 30th Sep- tember, Surgeon Reporter from 1st October to 19th October, Surgeon Bennett, M. D., from 20th October to 25th and from 16th November to 31st December, Brigade Surgeon Mauly from 26th October to 15th November. No. III.

There has not been much disease amongst the registered prostitutes, the cases admitted into hospital being of a very mild character; there were only 163 admissions into hospital as compared with 203 admissions in 1879.

IP/19/HG.4 No.808/46 FROM LINDSAY NEILL, ESQUIRE, c. s., OFFG. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Dated Nagpur, the 10th March 1882. SIR, I am directed to submit the reports with the prescribed Statements on the working of the Lock Hospitals at Pachmarhi, Saugor, Kamptee and Jubbul- pore for the year 1881. To facilitate comparison a statement is appended showing in a collated form the returns of these four institutions for 1880 and 1881. Pachmarhi 2. At Pachmarhi there was a marked decrease both among the troops and among the registered women admitted to hospital for vene- real disease. In respect to the men the admissions numbered eight, and it is reported that only in three cases was disease con- tracted on the plateau. Only six women were treated for disease. The strength of the troops kept at the Pachmarhi Depot is small, and as the civil population is not as yet large and women of immoral character soon become well known, it is only natural that the registration of prostitutes should be efficient. The Assistant Apothecary in charge of the Lock Hospital remarks that the Native police do not appear to exert themselves in suppressing illicit prostitution. It is however not surprising that this should be the case. The only troops at Pachmarhi are Europeans, and the Native police are naturally averse to interfering with women resorted to by them. Saugor. 3. In the Cantonment of Saugor there was more venereal disease among the European Foot Regiment stationed there during the greater part of the year, and more also among the regis- tered women. It is not easy for a non-professional to judge from the returns whether the type of disease among the men corresponds to that shown by the women. It would, however, appear that there has been a marked increase of leucorrh2 The Medical Officer in remarking on the want of efficiency of the present registration, has some observations regarding " the habits of native merchants " and others in the town," and seems to think that in order to prevent disease among the soldiers it is necessary to direct attention " to venereal diseases as " occurring among policemen." These remarks are not clear, and it is difficult to understand what the Medical officer would wish done. Lock Hospitals are established and Lock Hospital regulations framed in order to prevent the spread of venereal disease amongst troops, and it has hitherto been thought that the women who prostitute themselves to soldiers are a class by themselves. Jubbulpore. 5. At Jubbulpore there was a great increase of venereal disease among the troops, and a slight increase of disease among the regis- tered women. Disease seems, however, to have been mainly contracted on the line of march or imported from outside, and the Lock Hospital rules at Jubbulpore have in so far worked well, that in the second half of the year there has been a steady decrease in disease. General remarks. 6. The statistics of the year then appear to show that the working of the Lock Hospital rules at Pachmarhi and Kamptee has been fairly successful, but that their working at Saugor and Jubbulpore has been less so. At Jubbulpore, however, disease seems to have been contracted by troops on the line of march, and disease steadily de- clined during the second half of the year. The old difficulty of efficiently dealing with unlicensed prostitution is referred to in every report, and on this point nothing new can be said. The inexpediency of punishing soldiers who are admitted to hospital for venereal disease and fail to point out the women who diseased them lies of course in the circumstance that the apprehension of such punishment will lead soldiers to conceal disease as long as possible. The mea- sures which seem most suitable for suppressing illicit prostitution are :- (1), the exclusion of female coolies from the quarters occupied by single men ; (2), the careful watch by Regimental police of any women congregating in the vicinity of barracks ; (3), encouraging registered women to bring to notice any unlicensed women who prostitute themselves to soldiers. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LINDSAY NEILL, Offg. Secretary.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PACHMARHI LOOK HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1881. I received Medical charge of the Lock Hospital from Assistant Apothecary Walker on April 19th, 1881. The Hospital is the same building referred to in last year's report. Venereal diseases amongst soldiers. During the past year there were eight admissions from venereal amongst the men ; out of this number five are accounted for as having contracted the disease on the plains, and exhibited themselves on medical inspection of the men on the formation of the Depôt in April last; the remaining three occurred in this Station, and were doubtless con- tracted in the jungles. The whole of these were mild cases of local venereal, ulcers and gonorrh2 Registration of prostitutes. Efficient, and has been extended to 1st class prostitutes only, frequented by Europeans. Registration fees. No registration fees have been levied. Periodical examination. The women attended for examination regularly, which was held once and sometimes twice a week throughout the year. Look Hospital rules. The area over which the rules are in force is 3.62 square miles. Matron. The matron has been attentive. Remarks. Illicit prostitution has been carried on with impunity for some time; the Native police do not appear to exert themselves in sup- pressing it. I am of opinion that if pressure was brought to bear on them illicit intercourse would cease in a great measure. DAVID A. ELKINS, Assistant Apothecary, In Medical charge Lock Hospital.

13 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, KAMPTEE, FOR THE YEAR 1881. From Major R. M. B. Thomas, Cantonment Magistrate, Kamptee, to the Assistant Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur, No. G14 IV.15 same cause in the Lock Hospital, and it is hard to resist the conclusion that they are related as effect and cause Only 16 cases of primary syphilis were recorded in the Hospital books. The type of the disease is stated by the Medical officer in his last report to be mild, because the sore was of the soft kind. The same point has been noticed this year, but no such inference drawn, as it appears to be an open question, whether primary syphilis in women does not often, nay almost always, take the shape of a soft sore though infecting the individual. It seems to the undersigned that the Lock Hospitals of the Presidency might easily furnish data to set the question soon at rest. No admissions for non-vene- real affections are recorded.

IP|19|HG.4 No. 1251/75 FROM L. K. LAURIE, ESQUIRE, C. S., OFFG. ASST. SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER, Central Provinces. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT, Dated Nagpur, 29th March 1883. SIR, I am directed to submit the reports, with the prescribed statements, on the working of the Lock Hospitals at Pachmarhi, Saugor, Kamptee and Jubbul- pore for the year 1882. To facilitate comparison, a statement is appended showing in a collated form the returns of these four institutions for 1881 and 1882. 2. In all four places. there was an increase in the number of men admitted into hospital and in the ratio of admissions per thousand. There was a decrease in the number of registered women admitted into hospital at Saugor and Pach- marhi, but an increase at Jubbulpore and Kamptee. 3. The Assistant Apothecary in medical charge at Pachmarhi reports that in all the cases that occurred there the disease was contracted in the jungles. On his suggestion, women of bad repute were turned out of the station; and he is of opinion that this measure of prevention was completely successful. He does not, however, explain how the jungles were cleared. 4. The medical officer in charge of the hospital at Saugor again complains, of the number of unlicensed prostitutes, and says that no real help is given by the Civil Police towards the detection and registration of these women. He is not sure that the Regimental authorities are strict enough in prohibiting women of the lower classes from loitering within Regimental limits; and says that the Regimental Police who are expected to seize any women found so loitering did not report a single arrest during the year. To prove that the surveillance of the Civil Police was lax, he points to the fact that when, on one or two occasions during the year, it was considered advisable to prohibit soldiers from entering the City, the admissions into hospital rapidly decreased. 5. The officer in medical charge at Kamptee exonerates the Civil Police, from any blame, notwithstanding the fact that he has the strongest reasons for believing that such disease as existed was contracted amongst unregistered pros- titutes. He points out how difficult it is for the police to discriminate between honest women and clandestine prostitutes: and contends that it would be most dangerous to place more power in their hands for this purpose. 6. On the other hand, Dr. Maxham of Jubbulpore is of opinion that the Civil Police were not vigilant enough in the detection of unregistered prostitutes The Cantonment Magistrate at the same time records that every exertion was made to discover the source of the disease among the men, and that orders were even issued (at his Solicitation) prohibiting soldiers for a time from entering the City : with only partial success.
2 7. The Chief Commissioner has only a few remarks to make upon the facts and opinions abstracted above. The system involved in the maintenance of Lock Hospitals can never work so perfectly as to put an end to disease altoge- ther. It can only act as a palliative. It is impracticable, even if it were expe- dient, to confine soldiers within Cantonment limits: and it is not to be expected that unlicensed prostitution will cease in the adjoining city or jungles because it is prohibited in Cantonments. The Civil police cannot therefore be blamed if soldiers occasionally contract disease outside Cantonments. All that can be done is to enforce the registration rules as rigidly as possible within the area to which they are legally applicable: and to keep women of the lower classes from loiter- ing in the neighbourhood of barracks. There seem to be no grounds for suppos- ing that these precautions were neglected during the year: and the increase in diseases must therefore be attributed to fortuitous causes. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, L. K. LAURIE, Offg. Asst. Secretary.

IP/19/HG.4 IP Review by the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, of the Reports on Lock Hospitals in the Central Provinces for the year 1883. Pachmarhi. The average strength of the depot of troops at Pachmarhi was only 73. From among these there were only 4 admissions into Hos- pital against 10 last year out of a somewhat larger body of troops, and the ratio of admissions has decreased accordingly from 97.08 to 54.78 per mille. Huts with ablution-room and latrine attached have been provi- ded for the prostitutes. Kamptee. 2. There appears to have been some confusion in calculating the ratios of admissions in the tables given under paragraph III. of the Kamptee report. Accepting the strength of the garrison and the number of admissions to Hospital as given in the statements the ratio of admissions appear to be 1883 ... 126 per mille. 1882 ... 156 ,, ,, or of cases of disease contracted at Kamptee alone 1883 ... 98. 1882 ... 151.08 These figures show a satisfactory decrease. There was a corresponding decrease of disease among the women, which is attributed to increased cleanliness on their part. But the Medical officer writes that no relation could be traced between the disease at the European Hospital and that at the Lock Hospital. Saugor. 3. There has been at Saugor a slight increase in the ratio of admissions from among the European troops. The figures are- 1883 ... 293 per mille, with an average strength of 355. 1882 ... 284 ,, ,, 317. The officer in Medical charge is induced to believe that the number of prosti- tutes on the register does not accurately represent the amount of prostitution in Saugor by the same arguments which in 1882 and again in 1883 induced his predecessor to arrive at the same conclusion. This conclusion has moreover been accepted in more than one review of the Annual Lock Hospital Reports. The officer in Medical charge of the Saugor Lock Hospital has also in the last four annual reports repeated his conviction of the impossibility of getting from the soldiers clues to unlicensed prostitution, and has every year hazarded a conjecture that such prostitution could be suppressed near the Regimental lines at all events, if the Regimental Police did their duty properly. Jubbulpore. 4. There has been a marked decrease at Jubbulpore in the number of admissions with regard to cases of disease contracted at Jubbulpore. The figures given are2 With the exception of the annual complaint from the Saugor Medical officer of the inefficiency of Police surveillance, little is said on the subject of the Police. The Medical officer at Kamptee rightly points out that it would be dangerous to employ the Police in inquisitorial searches for unregistered prosti- tutes. It was pointed out last year by the Chief Commissioner that the Lock Hospital system can in the nature of things act only as a palliative within certain local limits of an existing evil. It cannot be expected to reach and suppress the evil outside those limits. The continuous decrease of disease at Kamptee is probably due to the non- employment of women in and about the barracks of single men. It is not said in the reports that this preventive measure was effectually in force in the other Cantonments. W. NETHERSOLE, Offg. Asst. Secretary.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, PACHMARHI, FROM 1ST JANUARY TO 31ST DECEMBER 1884. IP| 19|HC.4 Pachmari, 5 th January 1885. Lock Hospital building. I. The Look Hospital building is not at All suited for an institution of which it bears the name. It is a common mud structure measuring 23 ft. 9 inches x 13 ft. 3 inches, altogether too small, so much so that furniture and other hospital necessaries allowed by Government this year for Lock Hospitals could not be received. The doors and roof are of the most primitive description; the former are not well adapted and the tiling of the latter admitting both wind and weather. There is no means of guarding against women under treatment for syphilitic diseases leaving the hospital, since it has not an enclosure. Medical changes. II. No change. Venereal disease amongst troops. III. Out of an annual average strength of 123 European troops there have been 29 admissions for "venereal" disease and its sequel2 Lock Hospital be allowed to expend say to five rupees per month on a "detec- tive" or by way of rewards to persons affording a clue to the detection of any unauthorized plying of the trade. If this plan were adopted I feel almost sure that the end of 1885 will have seen many "waifs" brought to book. Two women were brought on and two removed their names during the year.

6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, SAUGUR, FOR THE YEAR 1884. From Lieutenant J. G. Morris, Cantonment Magistrate, Saugor, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,7 Women have voluntarily come forward for registration. The total number of women who obtained leave during the year was 14, giving a monthly average of 1.16 : although this is below the usual number, yet, I think, the greatest caution should be taken on the matter, as some of them occasionally overstayed their leave for a short time. VII.8 One case has been a very long time under treatment, probably due to the bad constitutional condition of the patient. The most marked beneficial result of the Lock Hospital system is to be found in the decrease of primary syphilis. XI.13 1884. Regiment. Period of occupation.

12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, EAMPTEE, FOR THE YEAR 1884. From Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. C. H Miller, Cantonment Magistrgte, Kamptee to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Prorinces, Nagpur, No 265, dated Kamptee, 20th January 1885. I have the honor to submit herewith the Annual Report on the work- ing of the Lock Hospital of this Cantonment for the year 1884. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE KAMPTEE LOCK HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1884, BY SURGEON MAJOR A. E, DALGAIRNS, 7TH REGIMENT, M. N. I., IN MEDICAL CHARGE, LOCK HOSPITAL I.IP IP|19|HG.4 Review by the Chief Commissioner of the Reports on Lock Hospital in the Central Provinces for the year 1885. Kamptee.2 5. There is a general consensus of opinion among the Medical Officers in charge that the prevalence of disease is chiefly due to the carrying on of clandes- tine prostitution by unregistered women to whom the men obtain access, and the remedy would appear to lie in the exercise of greater watchfulness over the pro- ceedings of the men by the Military authorities. The very small number of women registered in Kamptee, Jubbulpore and Saugor, as compared with the population of the area under the Act, shows that the registration system has not as yet had anything approaching a fair trial. 6. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 2,051, compared with Rs. 1,946 in the preceding year. 7. A Statement prepared in this office giving an abstract of the returns as submitted with the reports is appended. NAGPUR: The 26th March 1886. F. C. ANDERSON, Offg. Secretary.

5 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, SAUGOR, FOR THE YEAR, 1885. From Lieutenant J. G. Morris, Cantonment Magistrate, Saugor, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, central Provinces, Nagpur, 6 In 1884, with a strength of 154 men, showed 23 venereal diseases, or 149.35 per thousand. In 1883, with a strength of 148 men, there were 46 admissions, or 310.81 per thousand. In 1882, with a strength of 121·58 men, there were 23 admissions, or 189.17 per 1,000. The admissions to hospital during the year 1885 were:7 In every case, on the admission of a man to hospital with venereal disease, an endeavour has been made to trace the source, but with very limited success, many women have been indicated by the soldiers as having communicated the infection, but on examination these have almost invariably been found free from disease; it is believed that a very large number of coolie women are in reality prostitutes and that to this class the contamination of the troops is largely attributable. The registered prostitutes are of two classes:8 The most marked beneficial result of the Lock Hospital system is to be found in the decrease of Gonorrh9 Statement showing the extent of various forms of Venereal Disease among the European Troops in the Cantonment of Saugor, during the year 1885.

23 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, JUBBULPORE, FOR THE YEAR 1886. From Lieut.-Colonel H. H. H. Hallett, Cantonment Magistrate, Jubbulpore, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,24 there is of using every means to reduce as far as possible its spread; but without the co-operation of the Police all other measures for checking its prevalence are rendered futile and abortive, and at present I regret to say the Police in this station do not exercise that zeal and vigilance in the performance of this impor- tant part of their duty that they should do. When the above inactivity on the part of the Police in arresting women engaged in illicit prostitution, as required by Regulations, is taken into consideration, it will be seen how very unreasonable the disparaging remarks are which are so frequently made as to the efficiency of the Lock Hospital system to check the spread of venereal disease. No. 4.25 Copy of Docket No. 2130, data 30th October 1886, from the District Super- intendent of Police, Jubbulpore, to the Cantonment Magistrate, Jubbulpore. I have the honour to bring to your notice for such action as you may think proper, that registered prostitutes Buganea, Gujra, Gundhia, and. Nunhee were found this afternoon consorting with soldiers close to the Rest camp. Mussamats Janki and Radha of the Sudder bazar, who I believe are not registered prostitutes, were also similarly found. Mounted Head Constable Sukaram, Sowar Jadha Singh, and Constable Chakowri can identify these women. To the Cantonment Magistrate Jubbulpore. Cantonment Police report that on the 13th instant, at 2 P.M., Constable 2nd Class, Bulwant Singh, No. 664, observed Mussamat Parwathi Demiran in the nalla at the back of the Cavalry Lines with a soldier in the act of having sexual intercourse.

FRASER, Colonel, District Superintendent of Police. Extract from docket No. 66, dated 14th January 1887, from the District Superin- tendent of Police, Jubbulpore to the Cantonment Magistrate, Jubbulpore. I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your No. 10 of the 5th current, forwarding copy of letter from officer in Medical charge Lock Hospital, complaining that unregistered prostitutes meet soldiers in the grove of trees at the foot of the hill near the Native Cavalry lines. I beg to state that on a for- mer occasion when this was alleged I, in company with the late Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, frequently visited the locality in question, but found no pros- titutes about. As to the road leading from Messrs. Jowetts to the Theatre being frequented by unregisterd prostitutes, I have only to observe that on a few occasions lately I personally met women, but on sending them to the Station house found that they were registered prostitutes. From Surgeon-Major A. Sanderson, M. S., Senior Medical Officer, Jubbulpore, to the Cantonment Magistrate, Jubbulpore,26 REGISTER NO. 130. DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. With reference to the report on the Lock Hospital of Jubbulpore for last year, I would beg to submit the following for your information. It used to be urged formerly that venereal disease was contracted by soldiers cohabiting with women of the City of Jubbulpore who were unlicensed pros- titutes. With regard to the Medical Officer's remark, " that there are numbers of " unregistered prostitutes continually haunting cantonments and its environs is " well known, and on several occasions I have drawn attention to the, fact of " these women frequenting certain localities and urged the necessity of action on " the part of the Police to put a stop to this illicit prostitution which they could " hardly fail to be aware of but as yet, as far as I know, no steps have been " taken to remedy this state of affairs," I would beg to annex an extract from a letter I addressed the Cantonment Magistrate lately on the subject. It is further alleged that " the Police authorities are apparently passive in " the matter and I have never known a single instance where the Police have " apprehended and brought for examination an unregistered woman." Against this I beg. to send copies of reports made by me. At a meeting of the Lock Hospital Sub-Committee assembled on the 9th August last, it was resolved that the Officer Commanding Royal Warwickshire Regiment be requested to furnish a list of all women employed in any capacity about the married quarters of the Regiment, specifying whether married or single. I have not been favoured with a copy of this list up to date. Most of the officials had come to the conclusion that the disease was con- tracted by soldiers with women employed at the Barracks. The Cantonment Police have orders issued them to detect illicit prostitu- tion with soldiers, and I have also instructed the two European Constables to go about the Cantonments in the evenings to see if they can come across unregis- tered women soliciting soldiers. Lately I have noticed that women who have the appearance of prostitutes do not prowl or lurk about the Cantonment. Formerly they were in the habit of so doing, many of whom I myself had sent to the Cantonment for enquiry and found them to be registered prostitutes. JUBBULPORE : The 25th January 1887. H. FRASER, Colonel, District Superintendent of Police, Jubbulpore. Forwarded to Cantonment Magistrate. The letter No. 2130, of 30th October 1886, is alone partly relevant as it concerns the year 1886. I would like to know what was done about the two unregistered women. Rest camp is not in Cantonment. C. W. McMINN, 26th January 1887.

Before placing the Lock Hospital Report before the Cantonment Committee, I return it with Colonel Fraser's memorandum for any remarks you and the Officer in charge wish to make. MEMO. No. 63. Forwarded to the Officer in Medical, charge of the Lock Hospital, Jubbul- pore, for any remarks he may Wish to make. Early return solicited. A. SANDERSON, Surgeon-Major, M.

From Surgeon-Major A. Sanderson, M. S., in charge Station Hospital, Jubbulpore, to the Cantonment Magistrate Jubbulpore, No. 64, dated Jubbulpore, the3rd February 1887. In returning the enclosed I beg to observe with reference to the remark made by Colonel Fraser, in his letter No. 180, dated 25th January 1887, para- graph 6, " that it is the opinion of most officials that the disease (venereal) is " contracted from women employed in and about the barracks ;" that so far as my observation goes there are no grounds for such an assertion. The Bengal Barrack Regulations, paragraph 653, with regard to the employment of women as coolies, has been always strictly enforced.

One unregistered. woman is still remaining in Hospital, having been admitted on the 26th August with severe syphilis. The Hospital has worked satisfactorily during the year. It is difficult to detect the unregistered women to whom the soldiers resort secretly, but every effort is made to discover them. The men very seldom con- fess them, but generally attribute the disease, unjustly, to a registered woman. Local Native Doctor Jeyram has been in subordinate medical charge from 1st January to 29th December. He has given satisfaction. C. A. ATKINS, Surgeon-Major in Charge, Lock Hospital.

15 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE LOCK HOSPITAL, PACHMARHI, FOR THE YEAR 1887. From Lieut.-Colonel H. Hilton, Commanding at Pachmarhi, to the Under Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, Nagpur,16 that of the unregistered prostitutes for venereal disease, supports this view. In the month of May, after some enquiry, I was informed that two women roamed near the "butts" ostensibly with the object of picking wood, but that they had solicited soldiers ; I personally reported the circumstance to the Officer Commanding Pachmarhi, who issued orders that the police were to watch and apprehend any of them found immorally accosting the men or having any connection with them. Surgeon-Major Fairland, in Medical charge Pachmarhi, informed me- that a woman whose constitution was broken down by syphilis was brought by Native police to the Civil Hospital on 27th May and admitted, she was nearly two months under treatment and was after discharge from Hospital made over to the police who saw her down to the plains. I have no doubt she was one of the two I have mentioned, and am in- clined to attribute the 3 admissions for gonorrh17 Annual Statement No. I. of the Look Hospital, Pachmarhi, for the year 1887.

The women on the register are all examined weekly in the Lock Hospital where they are treated if found diseased. 8. How far has disease amongst the women increased or decreased. ? and. to what ex- tent has it become of a less virulent character ? State the different forms of disease among the women, and. the number of cases under each head. There has been a slight decrease of disease among the women. The admissions this year being 144 against 169 last year,22 Questions. Answers. 11. What measures are taken by the Regimental authorities to detect cases of concealed venereal disease amongst the men ? No special measures are taken by the Re- gimental authorities. 12. Has any change been made in the Hospital accommoda- tion during the year, and is the building suitable ? If not, state what alterations are considered necessary. The latrine has been repaired and enlarged. Building suitable. 13.

What is the rate of subsist- ence allowance, and is the same sufficient ? The women are dieted. in Hospital accord- ing to a fixed scale ; which is sufficient. There is therefore no subsistence allowance given. 19. State clearly to what extent the Police have or have not been of service in carrying out the Rules ? The Police have brought five women to be registered, and when breaches of Rules such as, absence from inspection have been reported they have searched for the women and brought them before the Cantonment Magistrate; but I consider they do not display sufficient activ- ity in searching for and having registered women practising illicit prostitution. 20. How many incurable women are there on the Register and what measures are re- commended for their dis posal. There are no incurable women on the Regis- ter.
23 Suggestions by the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital for the better carrying out of the Rules. No suggestions to make ; with the exception of increased vigilance on the part of the Police in searching for and bringing up illicit prostitutes. R. F. ADAMS, Surgeon, M. S., In Medical charge Lock Hospital. Report by the District Magistrate or Superintendent of Police. Received from the Medical Officer on the 9th January 1888. It is proposed to bring on the Register public prostitutes residing in the City who can be shewn to have consorted with European Soldiers, but the difficulty is to obtain satisfactory evidence that a woman is a public prostitute of this class. It is satisfactory to find that there has been a decrease of admissions among the European troops this year. I have heard it stated, though I do not know whether it was correctly stated, that there is little or no disease among the men of the Battery : that it is chiefly confined to the Royal Warrickshire Regiment. Statement No. 4 does not give details. Such details might possibly throw some light on the question of the prevalence of disease. F. C. ANDERSON, Offg. Dy. Commissioner. Observations and Recommendations by the Jubbulpore Cantonment Committee. Report received from the District Magistrate on the 10th January 1883. The Committee are glad to know that the Cantonment Police have showed more energy during the year in bringing 5 women to be registered. As formerly there were over 50 women resident in the city on the register as compared with 3 at the present time, the Committee fail to see why the City Police should find it more difficult now to obtain satisfactory evidence than they did formerly. With reference to the Magistrate of District remarks in regard to there being more disease in the Warwickshire Regiment than in the Artillery, the Committee in the absence of figures can offer no opinion. W. FIELD, Colonel, Royal Warwickshire Regt,. President. R. H. T. RENNICK, Lieut.- Colonel, 18 B. I. H. HALLETT, Lieut -Colonel, Cantonment Magistrate. Members.
24 Opinion of the General Officer Commanding Saugor District. Report received from the Cantonment Committee on the 20th January 1888. The decrease of venereal among the troops during the past year is so far satisfactory. The disease is however far more prevalent than it should be, and I trust that the Civil authorities and Police will render their best assistance in helping to bring about a more satisfactory state of things. The prostitutes in cantonment are under proper control and I believe that very little disease is contracted from them. I am of opinion that unregistered women who live in the city, who consort with soldiers on the outskirts of the cantonment, cause nearly all the mischief. Until these women are placed on the register and. periodically examined, I am afraid there will be no permanent or satisfactory diminution of the disease among the troops stationed at Jubbul- pore.

Registration and compulsory examina- tion of prostitutes was discontinued on the 6th August. 6. How far the registration has been efficient ; to what classes it extends ; and over what area. Any increase or de- crease in the numbers as compared with previous years should be explained. Registration is not very efficient, as there are only 52 women on the Registers. This is a small number for a civil population numbering 50,967, and a large military garri- son of 1 European Regiment, 1 Battery of Royal Artillery, 1 Native Cavalry Regiment, 1 Native Infantry Regiment. The area over which registra-­ tion extends is 7 square miles. Seven. women were newly registered during the year: the names of six have been taken off the list. 7. Whether registration fees have been levied and at what rate. No registration fees were levied. 8. Whether the women have been regular at the periodical examinations. Any remarks on the cause of irregularity, the number of individual women reported for non-attendance, the fines or other punishments awarded, and the amount realized. The women have been regular at the periodical examination apparently (vide Statement II). A number have been reported absent, but these have generally been women who have left the station temporarily to visit friends, &c. Two women were fined during the year, and the amount Rs. 1-8-0 was credited to the Cantonment Fund. 9. The arrangements for examining and treating the women of the City and Cantonment.

14 From the Cantonment Magistrate, Pachmarhi, to the Under-Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces,15 The Cantonment Sub-Committee has assembled regularly. Control. Military Police supervision was carried out when practicable; the Native Police appear not to have used the same strict supervi- sion as last year. Five prostitutes remained on the register at the end of 1887. Six were registered during the year. Six removed their names, leaving five living in the chakla on the 31st December 1888. No register has been kept, or examination held since the 23rd August 1888: the women have not presented themselves voluntarily for examination. The average strength during the year was 4.84. Registration fees. None were levied. Examination of prostitutes. Regularly held every 10th day, and intermediate ones in the event of those women pointed out by diseased soldiers. Disease amongst prostitutes. Only two admissions during the year, one for abrasion of vulva, the other bruised vulva, none for venereal disease. Quarters for prostitutes. The same building as heretofore has been occupied by them : the women possess the necessary articles for cleanliness for use of those that visit them. Employment of Dhai. One is employed whose duties combine control over the brothel and that of Lock Hospital matron. She has performed her duties satisfactorily. Remarks. No remarks or suggestions can be offered since registration and compulsory examination of prostitutes has ceased to be in force, in accordance with Circular Memorandum No. 12 of the 6th August 1888, from the Quarter Master-General in India to the General Officer Commanding.

The large number of women who absented themselves from the weekly inspections during the year appear to be those who circulated the disease among the Brisish troops stationed here, while those whose attendance was regular were invariably found not diseased. 8. No registration fees were levied. 9. All the women who attend are examined weekly by the Medical Warrant Officer in charge. 10. The Hospital Staff consists of 1 Medical Warrant Officer, 1 Dhai, 1 Bhisti, and 1 female sweeper. 11. No women at present in hospital. 12. Owing to the frequent changes in the Medical charge of the hospital during the year (see note 2) a considerable amount of difficulty has arisen. SAUGOR: The 19th March 1890. R.
