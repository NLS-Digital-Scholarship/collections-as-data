Vaccination Report. 1. The triennial full report is submitted with the modifications laid down in Government Resolution No. 7115 of 17th December 1901, in the General Department. Changes amongst the super- vising officers. 2. In all the districts except the western, changes occurred among the supervising officers, especially in the Gujarát Regis- tration District, and in the Western District the officer had to hold another charge which prevented his doing inspection. Vaccination in Native States. 3. The vaccination statistics of the following Native States are shown separately in Appendix II:2 Percentage of success, in- cluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases. 12. In primary vaccinations the percentage of success is 92.12 against 90.86 in the previous year, &quot;unsuccessful&quot; 1.32 per cent. compared with 1.14 last year, and the &quot;unknown&quot; 6.71 per cent. as against 8.12 per cent. the previous year. The excess operations amounted to 0.15 per cent. compared with 0.11 the year before. In each district the success percentage is higher than last year, except in the Southern and Aden Districts in which it is slightly less. 13. In re-vaccinations the percentage of success is 59.92 as against 56.96 in the previous year, 13.31 per cent. were unsuccessful and in 26.77 per cent. the results were &quot;unknown.&quot; The Central Registration District shows the highest figures. Percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown &quot; cases. 14. In primary vaccination 98.59 as against 98.76 in 1900-1901 and in the re-vaccination 81.82 as against 83.11. Successful vaccinations per mille of population. 15. The number of successful primary vaccinations of children under one year per mille of population was in the Western Regis- tration District 15.04 and in the Native States of that division 15.88. In the Central Registration District 16.05 and the Native States 13.09. In the Southern Registration District 17.87 and the Native States 12.36. In Gujarát 13.65 and the Native States 9.27. In Sind 15.34 and the Native States 18.98. Vaccination by Establish- ments. 16. The work done this year shows in each case a diminution except in the case of the work done by Dispensaries in which there is an increase of 414. The chief falling off, 91,458, is shown in the Local Fund Establishment. Government Vaccinators. 17. There is a Government Vaccinator for each of the Cantonments of Rájkot and Deesa; their work is supervised by the medical officer, Káthiáwár Agency, and is included in Appendix II3 Native State Vaccinators. Statement No. I. 21. The Native State Vaccinators operated primarily 51,356 times4 year 1901-1902 as required by Government in their Resolution No. 1039, dated 20th February 1901:5 nation was carried on throughout the year in four Municipalities and in two Cantonments, and in these 10,445 children were vaccinated. The total number of persons vaccinated with calf lymph during the year was 21,098 compared with 26,744 in 1900-1901. In the Rural Districts there were 10,653 operations compared with 14,306 in the previous year, and in the four principal towns and the two Cantonments 10,445 compared with 12,438 in 1900-1901. Human and animal lymph. The following statement shows the number and results of vaccination done with human and animal lymph during the year 1901- 1902 in this district:6 The cost per each successful case is higher this year, though the total cost is less, as the establishment owing to the reasons given for the smaller outturn could not work up to their full power. Work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 35. The highest number of children inspected in any one district during the year was (7,282) in the Western Registration District, and the lowest (2,292) in the Gujarát Regis- tration District. These officers travelled the distance of 11,140 miles in 634 days and inspected 21,196 children in 676 villages. Inspection from vaccination registers. 36. Of 21,196 children inspected, the results in 20,374 instances were tested by calling their names from registers, in which there were enrolled 38,317 names of whom 13 were vaccinated more than once on account of the failure of the first. Excluding the ' Absent' the inspecting officer returned 97.81 and the Vaccinators 98.16 per cent. as successful; out of 19,941 successful cases inspected 85.74 per cent. had good and sufficient cicatrices. Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 37. During the year inspection was carried out by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners in every Collectorate except Ahmed- nagar, Sholápur and Broach. In the Southern and Gujarát Registration Districts the inspection work was small owing to the absence of the permanent Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners in both the districts and to the Famine work they had to do in addition to their own duties. Work of Inspectors and Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination. 38. During the year there were 38 Inspectors of Sanitation and Vac- cination who were on travelling duty. The names of 305,024 children were called from registers of whom 199,185 were present and 105,463 absent, but their absence was accounted for, whilst 144 had migrated. Out of 199,185 children inspected 194,570 were protected and in 4,615 cases the operation was unsuccessful. Again out of 194,570 successful cases 166,234 had good cicatrices and 28,336 &quot; bad.&quot; In the registers tested the results were entered as 277,878 successful, 4,070 unsuccessful and doubtful, 23,076 unknown or absent, and 232 secondary operations. The greatest number of children inspected was in the Western Registration District and the greatest number of villages seen was in Sind. Conduct of members in the Department. 39. The conduct of the inspecting officers was reported to be satisfactory. The conduct of the Vac- cinators, clerks and peons with few exceptions was generally good. Inoculation. 40. No inoculation was reported to have been practised anywhere in the Presidency during the year under report. Ill effects by vaccination. 41. No instances were reported of any disease having been communicated through vaccination. Villages visited and not visited by Vaccinators. 42. Out of 49,714 villages in the Presidency 44,191 were visited by Vaccinators and 5,523 or 12.50 per cent. were not visited. In the British territory 36,864 villages were visited and 4,686 or 12.71 per cent. not visited, whilst in Native States the percentage of unvisited villages was 11.42. Small-pox by Collectorates. 43. The number of deaths from small-pox amounted to 4,277; of these 543 occurred in the Western Registration District, 163 in the Presidency Circle, 504 in the Central, 2,346 in the Southern, 58 in Gujarát, and 663 in the Sind Registration Circle. The greatest mortality took place amongst children between the ages of 1 and 12 and the number of persons successfully operated on in each district was 74,126 in the Western, 13,050 in the Presidency, 107,834 in the Central, 84,843 in the Southern, 46,067 in the Gujarát, and 78,797 in the Sind Circle. Every Collectorate, except Kaira, Panch Maháls and Ahmedabad, return deaths from small-pox, but the deaths in Broach and Thar and Párkar are few, two in each case. The highest number is shown in Kánara (1,175), next in Dhárwár (782), and then Khándesh (359).

The diagram. 17. The diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death-rate from small-pox during 1902-1903 is given in the appendix. Expenditure. 18. The total expenditure on account of vac- cination as compared with the preceding year is shown in the following statement:3 Progress of Animal Vac- cination. 19. Animal vaccination was carried on in the following places of the Bombay Presidency during the year:4 30. The table showing the number of children under one year of age in towns available for vaccination, etc., is given in Appendix III. In several Municipal towns the number of infants under one year old is in excess of the numbers estimated to be available for vaccination. The increase is probably due to defective birth registration. In Ahmedabad Town the large discrepancy between the number of children available for vaccination and the number actually vaccinated is apparently due to the custom of women living in towns going to their villages to be confined and returning when the child is a month or two old. This also applies to Ahmednagar and Poona towns. In the Bombay City many children born outside the limits of Bombay Municipality are vaccinated within its limits. A. V. ANDERSON, Acting Sanitary Commissioner.

Triennial Vaccination Report. This report on Vaccination in the Bombay Presidency for the year 1904-05 is the full triennial one and deals with the period 1902-03, 1903-04 and 1904-05. Changes amongst the Supervising Officers. 2. Seven officers held charge in the Western and two in the Central Registration District, elsewhere there were no changes. There is improvement in the current year, but until there is a sufficient number of general duty officers placed at the disposal of the Surgeon-General, the changes so detrimental to supervision must continue and vaccination suffer. Strength of Department. 3. Municipal.2 The percentages include &quot;unknown&quot;. Excess operations 1,006, 857 and 755, respectively, are excluded. Percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown cases &quot;. 6. The percentage of success, excluding &quot;unknown,&quot; was 98.59 as against 98.83 in 1903-04 and 98.89 in 1902-03, whilst the percentage of unsuccessful cases was 1.39, 1.24 and 1.17 respectively. These results are excellent and compare favourably with those in England and Wales, where the percentage of success for 1901-02 and 1902-03 was 98.6 and 98.4 respectively. Percentage of &quot; unknown cases&quot;. 7. The percentage of &quot;unknown cases&quot; was 5.90 as against 6.26 and 5.92 in 1903-04 and 1902-03 respectively. The large number of unknown cases habitually returned is partly due to the fear of parents of having lymph taken from their children's arms, and partly to indolence on the part of Vaccinators and parents. Infants successfully vac- cinated as compared with the number available, i.e., births minus deaths under one year of age. 8. The infants available for vaccination, after deducting the births from the deaths under 1 year of age, amounted to 522,421, of whom 390,971 or 74.84 per cent. were successfully vaccinated excluding Native States and Aden as against 363,038 or 79.99 per cent. in 1903-04 and 364,513 or 71.85 in 1902-03. The ratio of infantile protection afforded during the triennial period under report was 75.56 per cent. The above figures are only approximately accurate, as the &quot;unknown&quot; and ''unsuccessful&quot; cases are not given by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners &quot;under one year of age,&quot; moreover the registration of infantile deaths, is still far from correct. The percentage protection afforded to infants connot therefore be accurately recorded. The percentages for 1899-1900, 1900-01, 1901-02 were 78.29, 100.59, 76.56 respectively, and the triennial average 85.14. Re-vaccination. 9. The total number of persons re-vaccinated in 1904-05 was 61,934, of whom 26,884 were successful or 43.41 per cent. as against 35,830 with 19,768 or 55.18 per cent. successful in 1903-04 and 41,136 of whom 22,925 or 55.73 per cent. were successful in 1902-03. The percentages include &quot;unknown&quot;. Excess operations 9, 2 and 5 respectively are excluded. The average number of re-vaccinations performed during the triennium was 46,300 against 71,172 of the previous triennium. There was a marked increase in re-vaccinations by 26,104 over last year due to panic vaccination, chiefly in Bombay City during the small-pox epidemic of 1904-05. Compared with the population the amount of re-vaccination performed throughout the triennuim was trivial, caused by indolence, apathy and neglect of a secondary operation by the people themselves. Percentage of successful cases excluding ''unknown &quot;. 10. The percentage of successful cases excluding ''unknown&quot; was 79.12 against 80.15 in 1903-1904 and 82.78 in 1902-1903. Percentage of &quot;unknown cases &quot;. 11. The percentage of &quot;unknown&quot; cases was extremely high, 45.15 as against 31.17 in 1903-1904 and 32.68 in 1902-1903, the triennial average being 36.33 per cent. The disinclination of the people to re-vaccination accounts for the habitual small numbers operated on. It is only during epidemics of small-pox such as occurred in the year under report that any marked increase of re-vaccination occurs and that chiefly amongst a small section of the upper classes. Successful vaccinations per mille of population. The very large average number of &quot;unknown&quot; cases amounting to 36.33 per cent. for the triennium is due to the neglect of people to return to the vaccine stations for the purpose of having the results of their operation ascertained, 12. In 1904-1905 the total number of successful primary vaccinations of children under one year per mille of population was 21.21 against 19.49 and 19.47 in 1903-1904 and 1902-1903 respectively. The triennial average was 20.0 as against 19.14 for the previous triennial period. It would be more accurate and useful to compare the infantile protection with the births minus deaths as returned by the Local Government Board, England, but the figures are not available in this country.
3 Vaccination by Establish- ments. 13. There was a substantial increase in the total number of vaccine operations by each establishment. Establishment. 1902-1903. 1903-1904. 1904-1905.

There has been no change except in Káthiáwar where the work of the Deesa Cantonment vaccination was transferred from the Medical Officer, Káthiáwár Agency, to the station Staff Surgeon, Deesa, vide Government Resolution No. 3339, dated 8th June 1898, Political Department. Work done by Local Fund Vaccinators4 The table shows a steady increase in primary and a comparatively high in- crease in re-vaccination. The increase under both headings is due to the extra arduous work performed by the Municipal Vaccinators in face of small-pox prevalence. Native State Vaccinators5 The percentage of success in primary work by Dispensary Medical Officers is below that of the trained Public Vaccinators, which is mainly due to the greater experience, skill and practice of the latter officers. The above work was performed by the Medical Officers in charge of the dispensaries named below:6 District. 19027 Animal vaccination8 Cost of vaccination. 30. The total expenditure on account of vaccination is shown in the following table and also for the preceding five years. The successful cases excluding Dispensaries amounted to 587,572 and the average cost of each successsul case was annas 7 and pies 9 against annas 8 and pies 2 in the previous year and annas 8 and pies 9 in 1902-1903. The average cost per each successful case was therefore, for the triennial period, 8 annas 3 pies. Compared with last year the expenditure shows an increase under all establishments :9 Southern Registration Dis- trict. In the Southern Registration District Captain Hutchinson, Officiating Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, made 35 encampments, visited 18 tálukas and 6 town circles, travelled 4,927 miles in 209 travelling days, inspected 219 villages and 7,537 vaccinated persons or 5.45 per cent. of the total number vaccinated. Without register 2,335 cases were inspected. Notwithstanding the prevalence of plague by which 36.03, 35.09 and 61.69 per cent. of the villages in the Belgaum, Dhárwár and Bijápur Districts respectively were affected, and the time lost in training the Vaccination Staff in the method of vaccinating with preserved lymph, there was an increase of 11,644 primary operations over last year. He reports much opposition to re-vaccination throughout the District. Captain Hutchin- son was engaged actively throughout the year in extending vaccination with preserved lymph and accomplished much valuable and useful work. Western Registration Dis- trict. The inspection work in the Western Registration District was greatly hamper- ed by changes amongst the supervising officers. There were no less than seven officers holding charge during the year under report. Thirty-five encampments were made in 147 travelling days; 4,590 miles were travelled, 15 tálukas and 5 town circles and 297 villages visited. The number of vaccinated persons inspected was 7,879 or 7.02 per cent. out of the total vaccinated. 2,778 cases were seen without register. Central Registration Dis- trict. Sind Registration District. In the Central Registration District, Major Dyson made 41 encampments, visited 19 tálukas and 5 town circles, travelled 2,328 miles in 174 travelling days, inspected 7,460 vaccinated persons from the register and saw 2,812 old operations. Captain H. A. Forbes Knapton, D.P.H., I. M. S., made 24 encampments in 119 travelling days, visited 10 tálukas and 3 town circles and 149 villages. He inspected 3,490 vaccinated persons from the register or 3.52 per cent. of the total number vaccinated. Less travelling was done than in the previous year owing to the deputation of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner to Bombay and Madras during the early part of the cold weather. Town and village visita- tion. 33. The following statement shows the number of towns and villages by Registration Districts and the number unvisited by the vaccination staff during each year of the triennium under report:10 in the Western and Central Districts, and was severe each year in Bombay City. The table appended shows the total deaths from small-pox by districts for each year of the triennium together with the age period of deaths and is com- pared with the total number of persons successfully vaccinated. The proportion of children under 10 years of age who died from small-pox to the total deaths in 1902-03, 1903-04 and 1904-05 was 49.08, 54.62 and 55.83 per cent. respectively. The total recorded deaths during the triennium amounted to 17,842. To prevent such a death toll in future there must be compulsory primary and re-vaccination and a continuity of control by supervising officers. District. Total deaths from Small-pox. Age periods.

There were 38 Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination who were on travelling duty. The names of 327,541 children were called from registers, of whom 229,598 were present and 97,943 absent, but their absence was accounted for. Out of 229,598 children inspected 223,754 were protected and 5,844 were unsuccessful. Of the 223,754 cases returned as protected, 191,312 or 85.50 per cent. had good cicatrices and 32,442 bad or im- perfect ones, 14.50 per cent. In the Registers tested, the results as given by the Vaccinators were, successful 300,978 or 91.83 per cent., unsuccessful and doubtful 4,948 or 1.51 per cent., unknown or absent 21,834, and 219 secondary operations. Conduct of members in the Department. 36. The conduct of clerical establishment was excellent. The Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination worked well on the whole but require constant supervision. The majority of the Vaccinators worked well11 Compulsory Vaccination Act in Bombay City. 41. The Compulsory Vaccination Act Bombay (No. I of 1877) has been in force for 27 years. The following table shows the progress and the protection of infants during the last eight years, and the average of two decennial periods after and two years before the introduction of the Act:12 Compulsory vaccination in Lárkhána, Sakkur and Rohri (Sind). 43. Compulsory vaccination was introduced into Sukkur and Rohri in June 1904, the work is proceeding smoothly and so far no prosecutions for neglect of vaccination have been found necessary. In Lárkhána, the Act was introduced in April 1899 and works well. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner remarks that vaccination work in the towns where compulsory vaccination is in force compares more favourably than those in which it has not been introduced. Plague and Small-pox. 44. Vaccination has been carried out during the current year under great difficulties. In the Presidency plague destroyed 223,957 persons in 4,813 towns and villages during 1904. Throughout the triennium this pestilence was terribly destructive, causing 689,978 deaths, vide table below :APPENDICES. B 34214 APPEN A.15 DIX I.

Annual Reports.2 number of vaccinations. The number of vaccinations performed in 1904-05 bears almost exactly the same proportion to the number of births registered as the number vaccinated in five years in Karachi bears to the number of births there. But it is obvious from the number of deaths of children registered, and it is a well-known fact, that many children of Bombay residents are born in the mofussil and come to Bombay while still very young. The question arises whether all these children are vaccinated in the mofussil before coming to Bombay. Unless they are, some three or four thousand more vaccinations might be expected in Bombay. 4. The scheme for a depôt for the manufacture of preserved lymph for use all over the Presidency is under the consideration of Government. The results meanwhile of the vaccinations performed with lanolinated and glycerinated lymph, though not quite so good as those of ordinary vaccination, are very satisfactory, and the Sanitary Commissioner has been asked to extend his experiments to other parts of the Presidency and carefully test the glycerinated lymph in Gujarat, Sind and the Central Division. The Belgaum experimental depôt under Captain F. H. G. Hutchin- son, I.M.S., appears to be doing excellent work. 5. The prescribed maximum length of the triennial report is 8 pages, but the Sanitary Commissioner's report covers 12 pages. In the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council the excess might have been avoided by the omission of several unnecessary tables in the letter press (vide paragraphs 3, 13, 15NOTES ON VACCINATION IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY FOR THE YEAR 1905-1906, WITH APPENDICES.

Appendix I, Statement I, column 6 and Statement III, column 4. During the year under report there were 610,130 persons primarily vaccinated and 45,340 re-vaccinated against 606,058 and 61,934 in the previous year respectively, showing an increase of 4,072 in primary and a decrease of 16,594 in re-vaccination. Increase or decrease by Registration Districts. 2. In the Western Registration District there was a decrease of 5,108 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated compared with the previous year, and an increase of 1,110 in re-vaccination. The severity of small-pox in the early months of 1905 is held accountable for the decrease. Fewer children were available for vaccination during the present year, while the extra work done during the epidemic helped to swell last year's figures. 3. In the Presidency Circle, Bombay, there was a decrease of 1,324 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated, and in re-vaccination of 17,514 due in both cases to the unusually large number of persons vaccinated in the previous year during the prevalence of small-pox. 4. In the Central Registration District there was a decrease of 12,412 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and in re-vaccination of 1,146, attributable largely to the effects of famine and scarcity in scattering the people. 5. In the Southern Registration District there was an increase of 8,075 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and in re-vaccination of 604. It is satisfactory to note that in the three years during which preserved lymph has been in use in this district, there has been an increase of 20,831 operations. 6. In the Gujarát Registration District there was an increase of 3,647 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and a decrease of 1,234 in re- vaccination. 7. In Sind, much improvement is shown compared with previous years. There was an increase of 6,826 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and of 1,388 in re-vaccination. 8. In the Settlement of Aden there was an increase of 3,755 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and of 198 in re-vaccination. Infants successfully vacci- nated as compared with the number available. 9. Excluding Native States and Aden, the number of infants available for vaccination after deducting deaths under one year of age, from births, was 473,961 against 522,421 in 1904-05, of whom 384,267 or 81.08 per cent. were successfully vaccinated. Results in the number of persons primarily vaccinated. Appendix I, Statements Nos. I and III. 10. Out of 610,130 persons primarily vaccinated 560,443 or 91.86 per cent. were successful, 14,036 or 2.3 per cent. unsuccess- ful, while in 36,506 cases the result could not be as- certained as the children were not brought for inspec- tion. 855 persons were operated on a second time on account of the failure of the first operation. The percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown cases&quot; was 97.56. Results in re-vaccination. 11. During the year 45,340 persons were re-vaccinated. The number of successful cases was 25,915 or 57.16 per cent. In 11,313 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 8,125 the operations failed. In 13 cases the operation was repeated on account of the failure of the first operation. Sex. 12. There were 315,020 males and 295,110 females primarily vaccinated and 36,399 males and 8,941 females re-vaccinated during the year. The total number of persons operated on was 351,419 males and 304,051 females. Of the number of persons primarily vaccinated the sex percentages were 51.63 males and 48.37 females respectively. In re-vaccination the percentages were respectively 80.28 males and 19.72 females and in the total number of persons vaccinated 53.61 and 46.39. The small proportion of female re-vaccination is evidence of the difficulties met with in this class of work. Many girls of an age to be re- vaccinated cannot be touched by strange men. B 310-1
2 Caste or race. 13. During the year under review 4,620 Christians, 450,246 Hindus, 111,629 Mahomedans, 1,806 Parsis and 41,829 persons of other caste were primarily vaccinated. Age. 14. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years and above six years. The number under each age period primarily vaccinated was 485,147, 109,235 and 15,748 respectively. The number of infants success- fully vaccinated under one year was 448,654, between one and six years 99,951, and above six years 11,838. Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 15. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, visited 18 tálukas and 295 towns and villages, inspect- ed 10,634 vaccinated persons or 9.84 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,255 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, visited 20 tálukas and 286 towns and villages, inspected 7,242 vaccinated persons or 4.72 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,010 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, visited 15 tálukas and 126 towns and villages, inspected 2,509 vaccinated persons or 1.71 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,893 miles. In the Gujarát Registration District, the Deputy Sani- tary Commissioner visited 17 tálukas and 142 towns and villages, inspected 6,499 vaccinated persons or 5.54 per cent. of those vaccinated, and in Sind Registration District, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner visited 13 tálukas and 149 towns and villages, inspected 5,793 vaccinated persons or 5.40 per cent. of those vacci- nated and travelled 3,575 miles. The diagram. 16. The diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death-rate from small-pox during 1905-06 is given in Appendix IV. Expenditure. 17. The total expenditure on account of vacci- nation as compared with the preceding year is given in the following table : 3 lanolinated and glycerinated, which was manufactured at the Vaccine Depôt, Belgaum, was carried on successfully, and he remarks that the increase in the work cannot be attributed to a fall in the epidemicity of plague but rather to vacci- nation with preserved vaccine, lessening the difficulties confronting the vacci- nator and also possibly to the new method being more popular with the people. Training of Inspectors and Vaccinators in preserved lymph work at Belgaum Vaccine Depôt. 25. The number of Inspectors and Vaccinators trained at the Belgaum Vaccine Depôt was 98, of these 41 were from the Southern Registration District, 23 from the Central Registration District, 22 from the Western Registration District and 12 from the Gujarát Registration District. The Vaccinators, who have received training at the Belgaum Depôt, are being regularly supplied with preserved lymph from Belgaum and are working with it in their respective districts. 26. The following table shows the different kinds of lymph used, the work done with each kind and the comparative results obtained :APPENDICES.

Total number of persons primarily and re-vaccinated, Appendix I, Statement I, column 6 and Statement III, column 4. During the year under report there were 591,677 persons primarily vaccinated and 37,507 re-vaccinated against 610,130 and 45,340 in the previous year, showing a decrease of 18,453 in primary and 7,833 in re- vaccination. Increase or decrease by Registration Districts. 2. In Western Registration District there was a decrease of 2,836 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated compared with the previous year, and an increase of 1,541 in re- vaccination. The decrease in primary vaccination must be attributed to interruptions in work caused by the attendance of vaccinators on classes of instruction in the use of preserved lymph. 3. In the Presidency Circle, Bombay, there was a decrease of 1,369 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and of 2,790 in re-vaccination. In Bombay the supply of lymph was interfered with owing to an outbreak of rinderpest among the calves, and vaccination was interrupted by the extra work thrown on the staff in the preparation of glycerinated vaccine. 4. In the Central Registration District there was an increase of 3,938 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and a decrease of 2,571 in re- vaccination. 5. In the Southern Registration District there was an increrse of 5,177 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and of 1,266 in re-vaccination. 6. In the Gujarát Registration District there was a decrease of 1,471 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and in re-vaccination of 1,049. The decrease in primary vaccinations occurred only in Native States, of which there are an unusual number attached to the Gujarát District, and in which the same supervision as obtains in British Territory cannot be maintained with the existing staff. 7. In the Sind Registration District there was a decrease of 18,554 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and of 4,033 in re-vaccination. The decrease in vaccination is most marked in this district, the chief cause being a great prevalence of malarial fever among young and old of all classes. This outbreak was the result of widespread inundations due to heavy rain and an abnormally high and late rise of the Indus. 8. There was a decrease of 2,140 in the number of persons primarily vaccinated and 197 in re-vaccination in the Settlement of Aden. Infants successfully vacci- nated as compared with the number available. 9. Excluding Native States and Aden, the number of infants available for vaccination, after deducting deaths under one year of age from births, was 487,689 against 473,961 in 1905-06, of whom 368,819 or 75.63 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 81.08 per cent. in the previous year. Results in the number of persons primarily vaccinated, Appendix 1, Statements Nos. I and III. 10. Out of 591,677 persons primarily vaccinated, 528,576 or 89.34 per cent were successful, 22,452 or 3.79 unsuccessful, while in 42,323 cases the result could not be ascertained as the children were not brought for inspection. In the case of 1,674 persons a second operation was done on account of failure on the first occasion. The percentage of success excluding ''unknown cases&quot; was 95.93. The number of persons successful- ly vaccinated per 1,000 of population fell from 27.22 for the previous year to 25.32 during the year under report. Results in re-vaccination. 11. During the year 37,507 persons were re-vaccinated. The number of successful cases was 20,292 or 54.12 per cent. In 8,946 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 8,272 the operation failed. In 3 cases the operation was repealed on account B 4272 of the failure of the first operation. The demand for re-vaccination varies directly as the prevalence of small-pox : during the year 1905-06, 9,080 deaths from small- pox were recorded and 45,340 re-vaccinations were done, whereas during the year under report the deaths from small-pox numbered 3,049 and re-vaccinations fell to 37,507. Sex. 12. There were 302,934 males and 288,743 females primarily vaccinated and 29,322 males and 8,185 females re-vaccinated during the year. The total number of persons operated on was 332,256 males and 296,928 females ; of the number of persons primarily vaccinated the sex percentages were 51.20 males and 48.62 females respectively. In re-vaccination the percentages were respectively 78.19 males and 21.82 females, and in the total number of persons vaccinated 52.81 and 47.19. Caste or race. 13. During the year under report 4,015 Christians, 447,317 Hindus, 97,588 Mahomedans, 1,561 Parsis and 41,196 persons of other caste were primarily vaccinated. Age. 14. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years and above six years. The number under each age period primarily vaccinated was 478,972, 99,858 and 12,847 respectively. The number of infants successfully vaccinated under one year was 430,300, between one and 6 years 89,192, and above 6 years 9,084. Inspection work of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. 15. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, visited 24 tálukas and 229 towns and villages, in- spected 9,688 vaccinated persons or 9.78 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 5,010 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, visited 9 tálukas, 61 towns and villages, inspected 1,650 vaccinated persons or 1.18 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,316 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, visited 11 tálukas and 93 towns and villages, inspected 3,656 vaccinated persons or 2.67 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,802 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 20 tálukas and 168 towns and villages, inspected 7,116 vaccinated persons or 6.31 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 6,549 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, visited 10 tálukas and 124 towns and villages, inspected 2,028 vaccinated persons or 2.50 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 1,339 miles. The tours of several of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were interrupted by sickness and by additional charges being held. The Diagram. 16. The diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death rate from small-pox during 1906-07 is given in appendix IV. Expenditure. 17. The total expenditure on account of Vacci- nation as compared with the preceding year is given in the following table :3 Two Depôts for the manufacture of preserved lymph were at work through- out the year, one at Belgaum, from which most of the Vaccinators are supplied, and the other at Bombay for the local Municipal establishment. The Second Annual Report of the Belgaum Vaccine Depôt shows that at the beginning of the year 133 Vaccinators were being supplied with lymph and that at the end of the year this number had increased to 298. During the year a bacteriological laboratory has been added to the Belgaum Depôt, so that the purity of each supply of lymph is now tested before issue. In Sind the use of preserved lymph has not yet been introduced; calf lymph is used in Karáchi town, and human lymph throughout the various Dis- tricts of the Province. 19. The following table shows the different kinds of lymph used, the work done with each kind, and the comparative results obtained :APPENDICES. B 4276 APPEN A.7 DIX I.

In accordance with Government Resolution in the General Department No. 2426 of 17th August 1887, brief notes on Vaccina- tion for the year 1909-1910 are submitted with the usual statements. Transfer of the administra- tive control of vaccination. 2. In accordance with Government Resolution in the General DepartmentNo. 1863 of 8th April 1909, one Collectorate in each Registration District has been selected in which a trial for one year is to be given to the new system of local control of the Vaccination Establishment as proposed by the Government of India. The Collectorates selected are:2 Age. 9. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years, and above six years. The number under each ageperiod primarily vaccinated was 523,893, 121,197 and 20,512 respectively, while the successful operations for each age period were 489,004, 111,400 and 9,423. The ratio of infantile protection afforded during the year was 73.43 per cent. Inspection work of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners. 10. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District,visited 10 tálukas and 111 towns and villages, inspect- ed 5,952 vaccinated persons or 4.37 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,377 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, visited 16 tálukas, 182 towns and villages, inspected 6,652 vaccinated persons or 4.12 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,870 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, visited 3 tálukas, 8 towns and villages, inspected 921 vaccinated persons or .52 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,369½ miles. This officer was in charge of the Vaccine Depôt at Belgaum and was consequently unable to travel much on inspection duty. He was deputed to Aden and Amritsar on special duty. The Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 17 tálukas, 162 towns and villages, inspected 10,325 vaccinated persons or 8.16 per cent. of those vaccinated, and travelled 3,398 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, visited 20 tálukas, 112 towns and villages, inspected 3,126 vaccinated persons or 3.55 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,035 miles. The Diagram. 11. A Diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death-rate from small-pox during 1909-1910. is given in Appendix IV. Expenditure. 12. The total expenditure on account of vaccina- tion as compared with the preceding year is given in the following table :3 The recorded results from primary operations show case and insertion success rates of 99.22 and 95.33 per cent. respectively, and it is gratifying to find that with improved methods of storage under ice and of packing, the success attained in the hottest months of the year was generally good. The total cost of the Depôt for the year was Rs. 23,538-10-10 against Rs. 23,023-11-6 in the previous year, and the average cost of production works out at 5.4 pies per dose. With the sanction of Government a special agent for the purchase of calves was employed during the second half of the year. It is too soon to judge of the results of this experiment, but it promises an improvement on the unsatis- factory system of contracting. During the year, 979 cow calves were received into the Depôt, of which 868 were vaccinated and the lymph of 666 or 76.7 per cent. was judged suitable for use. A trial was made of buffalo calves, the yield of pulp from which is greater than in the case of cow calves; but there are circumstances connected with the use of buffalo calves for the production of vaccine which require further investi- gation before these animals can be brought into general use. The wastage among calvesAPPENDICES. B 5346 APPEN A.7 DIX I. TION RETURN. in the Bombay Presidency during the year 1909-1910. VACCINATION. REVACCINATION.

This report on vaccination in the Bombay Presidency deals with the triennial period 1908-09, 1909-10 and 1910-11. Supervision in the Native State. 2. In accordance with Government Resolution in the Political Department No. 1635, dated 11th March 1911, the supervision of vaccination in the Akalkot State by this Department has been withdrawn and the State authorities will in future make their own arrangements for vaccination. Control of vaccinators by local bodies. 3. By Resolutions No. 1863, dated 8th April 1909, and No. 464, dated 2Sth January 1910, in the General Department, Govern- ment sanctioned a trial for one year of the system of control of vaccinators by local bodies, and the districts selected for this purpose were Surat, Sholápur, Bijápur, West Khándesh and Sukkur. The working of this new system will form the subject of a special report to Government. 4. During the year 1910-11 owing to the absence on leave of the permanent incumbent and his transfer towards the end of the year to Bombay to act as Port Health Officer, the office of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, was held by four officers. In Sind, the Civil Surgeon, Karáchi, acted as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner as an additional charge for the last eighteen days of March during the absence of Captain Murphy on deputation to Amritsar. There were no changes in the other registration districts. The advisability of employing full time officers in the Department has been recognised and it is hoped that in future such officers will be available for all but the short time vacancies. Strength of the Depart- ment. 5. Except the entertainment of two additional vaccinators in Sind, and one in Bombay City, no changes took place in the Vaccination Establishment. Primary vaccination, Appendix I, Statements I and III. 6. The total number of persons primarily vaccinated during 1910-11 was 661,637 as compared with 665,602 in the preced- ing year and 672,252 in 1908-09. The average number of persons vaccinated annually during the triennium under review was 666,497 against 599,230 in the preceding triennial period, showing an increase of 67,267. The number of persons successfully vaccinated in 1910-11 was 601,350 against 609,827 in 1909-10 and 599,291 in 1908-09. Although there was a decrease under this head in 1910-11 as compared with the last year the average for the triennium shows an increase of 62,898 persons successfully vaccinated. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known was 98.76 in 1910-11 against 96.96 in 1909-10 and 96.02 in 1908-09. The average percentage in the triennial period under report was 97.25 against 96.80 in the preceding triennium. 7. An instructive comparison can be made by noting the results of primary vaccinations during the present and two preceding triennial periods. The averages of numbers vaccinated and the success attained are shown in the following table:2 The first period saw the introduction of preserved lymph and its trial on a small scale in various districts of the Presidency proper. It was an experiment and the results were not equal to those obtained from human and calf lymph. During the second period the use of preserved glycerinated lymph was greatly extended in all registration districts, except Sind. A large proportion of the work was done with preserved lymph, but still the results, although showing great improvement, fell short of those obtained from human and animal lymph. The last period has witnessed the introduction of glycerinated lymph into all British districts of the Presidency except Sind, and into a considerable number of the Native States. The use of preserved lymph has greatly facilitated the work of vaccinators, as shown by the large increase in the number of operations, while the improved methods of preparation and storage of lymph and the greater experience and skill of vaccinators in using it, have brought the results up to the best obtainable by any kind of fresh lymph. Percentage of &quot; unknown &quot; cases. 8. The percentage of unknown cases was 8.01 against 7.46 in 1909-10 and 7.31 in 1908-09. An increase in &quot;unknown&quot; cases was chiefly noticeable in the Western, Central and Sind Registration Districts. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, states that &quot; the high percentage of unknown children is due largely to the fact that parents deliberately avoid showing the results lest children be taken as vaccinifers, and also to the nomadic character of a large portion of the population of the Province. &quot; Re-vaccination. 9. The number of persons re-vaccinated in 1910-11 was 59,403 as compared with 48,885 in the preceding year and 52,362 in 1908-09; the average annual number of persons re-vaccinated during the triennium under review being 53,550 against 41,267 in the preceding triennium, showing an increase of 12,283. The number of successful re-vaccinations was 19,065 during 1910-11 as compared with 20,979 in the preceding year and 22,975 in 1908-09. For the triennial period under review the average annual number of successful re-vaccinations was 21,006 against 22,847 during the preceding three years. Re-vaccination is chiefly confined to the large towns and varies according as small-pox is more or less prevalent. Vaccination under various establishments. 10. The average number of primary operations performed by the various establishments during the three years under review as compared with previous triennial periods may be summarized as under : Vaccination in Municipalities shows a steady increase in numbers from 59,431 in the triennium 1902-05 to 90,806 in the three years 1908-11. The Cantonment establishment records a decline from 1,933 to 1,782 operations during the same two triennial periods. The Local Fund Vaccinations have maintained a steady average, the numbers being 427,337 in 1902-05, 448,702 in 1905-08 and 443,917 in 1908-11. In Native States there was a steady rise from 76,237 in the triennium 1902-05 to 87,989 in the triennium under review. Lymph supply. 11. The quality of lymph supply was reported on the whole as good by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. Result of lymph. 12. The following table shows the different kinds of lymph used, the work done with each kind and the comparative results obtained in each district during the year 1910-11, as required by Government Resolution, General Department, No. 1039, dated 20th February 1901:3 Districts.

It will be seen from the above statement that a high standard of success was attained with glycerinated lymph in all districts except Sind where a few experimental trials only were made. Animal vaccination. 13. During the year vaccination from calf to arm was carried out in the Southern and Sind Districts and in the Presidency Circle. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. 14. The new buildings though incomplete were occupied in August 1910. During the year 635,282 doses were distributed as compared with 649,972 in 1909-10 and 606,005 in 1908-09. Of this vaccine, 595,589 doses were sent to vaccinators of the Presidency and the result was 527,759 operations against 525,441 in 1909-10 and 498,278 in 1908-09. The case and insertion success rates in primary vaccination were 99.02 and 95.26 per cent., respectively, as compared with 99.22 and 95.33 per cent. in 1909-10 and 97.22 and 94.78 per cent. in 1908-09. 15. During the triennium under review great progress in spite of many difficulties has been made at the Vaccine Institute. The distribution of vaccine, which had reached 544,408 doses during the last year of the previous triennium, has exceeded 600,000 doses during each of the past three years, while during the same period the case success rate has risen from 95.61 to 99.02 per cent. in primary vaccination. Preserved lymph is now in use throughout the greater part of the Presidency and its Native States, and its introduction into Sind is only delayed by absence of adequate cold storage. It has been found impossible to guarantee uniform high potency lymphs throughout the year. There is an optimum season for production of lymph, which depends on various factors of temperature and of the health and feeding of calves, and as soon as the cold storage plant is installed it will be possible to to take full advantage of this period in which to make a whole year's supply of lymph, which improves under proper conditions of storage. 16. The total cost of the Institute during the year amounted to Rs.22,860-5-0 against Rs. 23,538-10-10 in 1909-10 and Rs. 23,023-11-6 in 1908-09, and the average cost of production was 5.14 pies against 5.4 pies last year. Cost of Vaccination State- ment No. II. 17. The expenditure on vaccination amounted to Rs. 3,56,870-6-10 as compared with Rs. 3,47,974-6-9 in 1909-10 and Rs. 3,27,369-12-10 in 1908-09, the average annual ex- penditure during these three years being Rs. 3,44,071 against Rs. 3,07,122 in the preceding triennium. The increase is due to the difference in pay drawn by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, the payment of pony allowance to vaccinators and the entertainment of additional staff. The successful cases, excluding vaccination in dispensaries, were 618,882. The average cost for each successful case was annas 9 and pies 3, against annas 8 and pies 10 in 1909-10 and annas 8 and pies 5 in 1908-09.
4 Inspection work done by the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners. 18. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioners inspected 22,254 vaccinated persons by calling names from vaccination registers in 1910-11 against 20,741 in the opening year of the triennium, and of these only 736 were cases of re-vaccination. The amount of inspection work in the Western, Central, Southern, Gujarát and Sind Registration Districts was 5,879, 5,484, 1,239, 7,054 and 2,588 persons respectively, the respective per- centages being 4.44, 3.24, .79, 5.37, and 2.81 to the total number vaccinated. The annual average of inspections was 23,324 vaccinated persons during the period under report against 24,018 in the preceding triennium. In addition to the above 14,421 older operations were seen by these officers without using the registers. Tours of the Deputy Sani- tary Commissioners. 19. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, &quot;Western Registration District, visited 14 tálukas and 109 towns and villages and travelled 1,027 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, Central Registration District, visited 175 towns and villages in 17 tálukas and travelled 2,938 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, travelled 4,415 miles and visited 26 towns and villages in 5 tálukas. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 15 tálukas and 116 towns and villages and travelled 3,957 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registra- tion District, visited 108 towns and villages in 24 tálukas and travelled 4,803 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, held charge of the Vaccine Institute in addition and was consequently unable to do much inspection of vaccination. Work of the Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccin- ation. 20. In 1910-11 the Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination in the Presidency numbered 40; they inspected 262,425 vaccinations,5 Compulsory Vaccination Act in Bombay City. 28. The Compulsory Vaccination Act, Bombay (No. I of 1877) has been in force for 33 years. The following table shows the progress and the protection of infants during the last fourteen years and the average of two decennial periods after and two years before the introduction of the Act:APPENDICES.

Vaccination work in Native State. 2. By Government Resolution in the Political Department, No. 1635, dated 11th March 1911, this department was relieved of the supervision of vaccination work in the Akalkot State and therefore the statistics relating thereto have been shown in Appendix II. Administrative control of vaccination by local bodies. 3. The scheme relating to the control of vaccinators by local bodies was extended for a further period of one year by Government Resolution in the General Department, No. 7321, dated 27th December 1911. All things considered, the experiment has not been an unqualified success. The District Local Boards cannot deal with the technical points involved. They expect the Inspectors to do clerical work which was never intended to be included in their duties, thereby wasting valuable time which might be much better employed in other ways, and there is a general lack of supervision all round, which predisposes to slackness and inefficiency amongst the vaccinators. Strength of the depart- ment. 4. There was no change in the strength of the establishment except for the creation of two new posts of Municipal Vaccin- ators, one in Sholápur and the other in Jacobabad towns. Total number of persons primarily vaccinated and re-vaccinated (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 5. During the year 1911-12, 692,173 primary vaccinations and 68,692 re-vaccinations were performed against 661,637 and 59,403 in the previous twelve months, showing an increase of 30,536 in the former and 9,289 in the latter. Increase or decrease in primary and re-vaccination. 6. There was an increase in primary vaccination in all the Registration Districts except the Central where there was a decrease of 2,296, which was attributed to the deficit of avail- able children owing to the abnormal number vaccin- ated at the time of the severe epidemic of small-pox at Poona in 1910. There was a slight decrease in re-vaccination in the Western and Central Registration Districts. It is satisfactory to record this increase in spite of the severe plague epidemic of 1911-12 and a decrease in the population in some districts of the Presidency. Results in the number of persons primarily vaccinated (Appendix I, Statements I and III). 7. Out of 692,173 persons primarily vaccinated 629,814 or 90.99 per cent. were successful, 6,356 or .92 unsuccessful, while in 56,243 cases the results could not be ascertained. In 240 cases a second operation was done on account of the failure of the first attempt. The percentage of success excluding &quot; unknown&quot; was 99.00. Results in re-vaccination. 8. During the year under report 68,692 persons were re-vaccinated. The number of successful cases was 19,123 or 27.84 per cent. In 31,341 instances the result could not be ascertained and in 18,243 the operation failed. In 15 cases the operation was repeated. Sex. 9. There were 358,719 males and 333,454 females primarily vaccinated and 55,147 males and 13,545 females re-vaccinated during the year. The total number of persons operated on was 413,866 males and 346,999 females. Of the number of persons B 5042 primarily vaccinated the sex percentages were 51.83 males and 48.17 females respectively. In re-vaccination the percentages were 80.28 males and 19.72 females and in the total number of persons vaccinated 54.39 males and 45.61 females. Caste or race. 10. During the year under review 5,658 Christians, 522,836 Hindus, 123,151 Mahomedans, 1,678 Parsis and 38,850 persons of other caste were primarily vaccinated. Age. 11. The age details are compiled for three periods, viz., under one year, between one and six years and above six years. The number under each age-period primarily vaccinated was 541,122, 129,538 and 21,513, respectively, while the successful operations for the same were 501,708, 118,468 and 9,638. Inspection work of the Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners. 12. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Western Registration District, visited 13 tálukas and 126 towns and villages, inspect- ed 5,170 vaccinated persons or 3.70 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 4,668 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Central Registration District, visited 16 tálukas, 99 towns and villages, inspected 4,464 vaccinated persons or 2'89 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,311 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Southern Registration District, visited 11 tálukas, 135 towns and villages, inspected 7,428 vaccinated persons or 4.50 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,801 miles. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Gujarát Registration District, visited 10 tálukas, 104 towns and villages, inspected 3,804 vaccinated persons or 2.84 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 3,528 miles. A good deal of his time was taken up with famine work. The Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Sind Registration District, visited 17 tálukas, 119 towns and villages, inspected 3,569 vaccinated persons or 3.51 per cent. of those vaccinated and travelled 2,609 miles. The diagram. 13. A diagram showing the proportion of population protected during seven years and the death-rate from small-pox during 1911-12 is given as Appendix IV. Cost of vaccination (State- ment No. II). 14. The expenditure on account of vaccination amounted to Rs. 3,53,706-10-7 as compared with Rs. 3,56,870-6-10 in 1910-11. There was an increase under Local Fund, Municipal and Native States establishments which was due to the grant of bonus and grain compensation allowance. The decrease under Provincial head was due to the difference in the pay and allowances drawn by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. The successful cases excluding dispen- saries were 648,357, the average cost for each successful case being annas 8 and pies 9 against annas 9 and pies 3 for the previous year. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. 15. The main buildings for the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, are now com- plete with the exception of the Director's bungalow. The work of putting in the refrigerating plant and engines has not yet been started and the fittings of the inoculated calves stable have not been finished. 16. During the year 673,812 doses were distributed as against 635,282 in the previous year, of which 602,573 were distributed to vaccinators of the Presidency and 19,524 to various medical officers, the cost of each dose issued being 7.26 pies against 5.14 last year. The results of the vaccine issued to vaccinators in the Presidency show case and insertion success rates 99.21 and 95.70 respectively. The total cost of the Institute was Rs. 34,413-4-9 against Rs. 22,860-5-0 in the previous year. The increase is due to the pay and allowances of the Director and First Assistant Superintendent; also increase of pay in the superior staff. There is also an increase under the heading miscellaneous articles due to the purchase of apparatus for the Laboratory. Results of lymph. 17. The following table shows the different kinds of lymph used, the work done with each kind, and the comparative results obtained:3 Districts. Kind of lymph used. Number of Operations.

No authentic instances have occurred of any other disease having been communicated through vaccination. A case of general vaccinia was reported from the Western Registration District, which ended fatally. Such occurrences are extremely rare and cannot be accepted as genuine unless they are actually seen by a com- petent medical man at the time. The description of the condition usually given is that &quot;the vaccination burst out all over the body&quot;, and on inves- tigation it almost always transpires that the disease was contagious im- petigo contracted a few days after the operation was performed and there- fore assumed to be the direct result of it. Occasionally returns are received showing a death as directly due to vaccination, without any further skin lesions ; on enquiry it invariably turns out to be due to coincident malaria. Inoculation. 19. Inoculation with unattenuated small-pox virus appears to have been somewhat extensively practised in the Nara Valley Division of Thar and Párkar District, which was responsible for a somewhat severe outbreak of the disease. Two individuals were prosecuted on this account under Section 269 of the Indian Penal Code. One was discharged, the learned Magistrate ruling &quot; That inoculation is not illegal, but that it should be done under such safeguards that there should be no likelihood of the spread of the disease.&quot; But he ordered the man's stock in trade to be confiscated. It consisted of a couple of old and rusty lancets and a small tin box, full of dry small-pox scales. This decision apparently has been accepted as correct, wherefore I would advocate the urgent necessity of a revision of the laws relating to the subject. The other case is still pending. 20. The table showing the number of vaccinations performed in municipal towns on children under one year of age is given in Appendix III. The work of the Department is far more efficiently carried on in those towns where the Vaccination Act is in force. In Karáchi, for instance, the ratio of the number of vaccinations performed under one year to those of the available children is 105 per cent.; (this seeming absurdity is due to the fact that numerous infants are brought in from the Jam's territoryAPPENDICES.
