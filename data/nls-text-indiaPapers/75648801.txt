GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., held the post of Director of Veterinary Services, Sind, throughout the year. He toured in each district and inspected most of the Dispensaries. He also inspected the stallions maintained by the District Local Boards and Stud Bulls as opportunity occurred. He supervised the work in Ajmer-Merwara in addition to his own duties. He attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at New Delhi, and acted as Judge at the Jacobabad Horse and Cattle Show. He was on tour in Sind for seventy-eight days and travelled 1,108 miles by rail and 180 miles by road, in addition to touring in Ajmer- Merwara for twenty days. 2. The post of Officer-in-charge, Goat Virus Producing Station, was held by Mr. C. S. G. Haji, G.B.V.C., who did good work in main- taining a constant supply of Potent Vaccine. 3. Mr. H. S. Bawa, M.R.C.V.S., continued to hold the post of Veterinary Investigation Officer, Sind and Ajmer-Merwara. He was on leave from 5th June to 4th July 1939. He was on tour in Sind for 108 days travelling 5,139 miles by rail and 1,189 miles by road as against 114 days and 9,398 travelled by rail and 1,134 miles by road in the previous year. Mr. Bawa was also on tour for 19 days and travelled 2,204 miles by rail and 260 miles by road in Ajmer-Merwara during the year under report. His work is mentioned in para. 43 below, under the head II.2 that the lesser incidence of this disease during the year under report was due to the absence of rain and a consequent diminution in the number of biting flies which act as carriers. 7.

Medicines and advice were given to 16,612 cases not brought to the hospitals or dispensaries as compared with 5,244 in the previous year, while the No, of Castrations performed was 3,870 as against 3,559 in 1938-39. III.7 50. Mr. Abdul Majid N. Siddiqi continued to hold the post of Veterinary Inspector. He was on tour for 134 days and travelled 5,471 miles by rail and 706 miles by road as against 139 days, 4,087 miles travelled by rail and 570 miles by road in the previous year. He ins- pected all Veterinary Dispensaries twice and visited Government Agricultural Farm, Gaushalas, etc., on several occasions and inspected Government Stud Bulls when required. 51. The names of:8 sion to the Bombay Veterinary College has been raised from Matricula- tion to Intermediate Science (B. Group). This has resulted in an un- forseen and sudden stoppage of scholars so that the position as regards the filling of new posts and vacancies caused by casualties is becoming more acute and will have to be examined in all its aspects at an early date. As the budget provision for increasing the cadre of Veterinary Field Compounders was not passed by Government, expansion of this service was also rendered impossible. 56. Nineteen horses from overseas were landed at the Port of Karachi during the year as compared with the same number in the previous year. One pony, 2 Donkey Stallions and 595 mules were im- ported through this port by the Army Department of the Government of India, during the year 1939-40. Karachi, J. H. G. JERROM, 12th September 1940.
