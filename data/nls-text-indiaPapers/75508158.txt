The number of horse stallions present at the beginning of the year, as shown by Table I, was 357 ; to which 52 were added and 63 removed from the Register, leaving a balance of 346. The 63 removed from the Register include 1 Arab and 1 T. B. E. horse stallion presented to the Vankaner and Palitana States respectively, under the sanction of the Government of India in recogni- tion of efforts made to maintain and improve the indigenous breed of horses. One Cyprian donkey stallion was also presented to the Vankaner State. 2. The strength of pony stallions in the Bombay Presidency stood at 18, being one in excess of the previous year. Ages of stallions. 3. Table II shows that of 346 horse stallions remaining at the end of the year, 166 were up to 10 years of age ; 158 over 10 and up to 15 years ; and 22 over 15 years old. Number of stallions at work. 4. A reference to Table V will show that or 346 horse stallions on the Register, 280 were actually employed at stud work, the remaining 66 were unacclimatized and ineffective from sickness or other causes. Cost of feed and keep. 5. A satisfactory decrease under this head will be observed by reference to Table IX. The general average annual cost, including feed, keep, attendants, gear and clothing, etc., amounted to R339-12-8 against R366-1-10 in the previous year. 6. The number and classes of stallions received during the year, either by importation or by purchase in India, were as follows :2 8. The average cost of those imported from England, is :3 24. Dealing with this subject, it may be noted that no reliance whatever can be placed on the produce returns as the staff maintained for collecting them is, I think, inadequate. I had occasion to go into this matter very care- fully in the Bombay Presidency and found that the Depôt stallions which were under my immediate control and where I was able to, more or less, check results, showed a produce percentage of 43.41, whereas, the combined results throughout the Presidency and Sind only amounted to 26.30. I think that there cannot be much doubt that the young stock are in the country, and it is very unsatisfactory that we are not able to record more accurate results. 25. This subject has received very careful consideration by the Civil Authorities and this Department, but up to date, I regret to say, no sound method has been suggested (without entailing great expenditure) to collect this information. Country-bred Remounts purchased. 26. There is an increase in the number of country-bred Remounts bought: the figures standing at 1,433 against 1,297 in the previous year. The number purchased by the Army Remount Department is about the same as last year, but there is an increase in those secured by the Native Cavalry and Police. Relative success of different classes of stallions as sires. 27. From Table XIV, which is an abstract showing the produce of Gov- ernment stallions that won prizes at Horse Fairs and Shows, it will be observed that the Australians again took the lead with a proportion of 6.93. Thorough- bred English come next with 4.40, Stud breds with 4.14 and Arabs with 2.75. General statement of the cost of the Department. 28. A reference to Table XVIII will show that the cost of this Depart- ment, debited to India Estimates, amounts to R6,56,620-11-8 against R7,21,878-15-8, giving a decrease of R65,258-4-0. The principle decreases appear under the heads of Prizes4 year. By deducting the 60 received during the year and the 7 immature don- keys which are being reared at the Hissar Farm, it will be observed that the services of all the remaining donkey stallions were utilized. Cost of feed and keep. 33. There is a satisfactory decrease of nearly R20 per donkey in the cost of feed and keep. Table XII shows the average to be R163-15-11 against R183-4-3 in the previous year. Short note on each class of donkey stallion. 34. Of the two batches sent by the lately appointed official purchaser5 Supply of donkey Stallions. 46. In the indent for donkey stallions for the year under review, the number asked for, was: 6 BALUCHISTAN. 53. As in last year, two Horse Shows were held in Baluchistan. Com- petition for prizes was keen, there being 1,539 competitors against 1,279 in the previous year. Two hundred and three remounts were purchased for Remount Department and Native Cavalry against 113 last year. SIND. 54. Three Horse Shows were held7 the year was 4 horse stock and 3 mules. The breeding of horse stock from these Farm mares having proved unsatisfactory, or rather less remunerative than the production of mules, orders have now been issued that in future all Farm, mares be served by donkey stallions. 59. Five mares died and two were destroyed. One Instruction Farm horse (gelding) was destroyed being old and worn out, and 3 stallions (Arabs) were sold to District Boards for stud purposes. 60. Owing to insufficient and badly distributed rainfall, the season for cultivation was reported as unfavourable, notwithstanding which the outturn was satisfactory, resulting in a saving of R588-11.0 over the year's outlay. Punjab. 61. During the year under review there were 5 colts and 1 filly dropped. The remarks made in paragraph 58 above, regarding all Farm mares being served in future by donkey stallions, apply also to the Punjab Instruction Farm. 62. Four mares were sold, being unfit for Farm and breeding purposes; and one stallion (Arab) was disposed of to the Kangra District Board for stud purposes. 63. The Balance Sheet of cultivation operations continues to show a loss. With scanty and uncertain falls of rain, added to the difficulties of water supply for irrigation purposes, no hopes can be entertained at present, of the Farm being worked to advantage. GOVERNMENT CATTLE FARM, HISSAR. 64. The financial results of the working of the Farm during the year 1901- 1902, will be found recorded in Table XIX. 65. My first inspection of this Farm led me to think that it would be advisable to greatly reduce the existing head of stock, as a large number were small, stunted and of very mixed and indiscriminate breed, and to make more efficient arrangements for the management of the cultivation. With these objects in view, a Committee composed of the following Officers8 72. In the interests of the young stock, it was decided to abolish the Dairy as the loss to young growing stock was not compensated for by the small pro- fits derived from the sale of milk and butter. 73. The Committee made further suggestions with regard to the cultiva- tion which have been accepted and put into working order. A thoroughly trained practical agriculturist, Mr. Bhimbai, has been appointed and with the help of Mr. Mollison, Inspector General of Agriculture in India, trust that more successful results will be obtained. 74. Seventeen bulls were supplied to the districts and 94 bullocks issued for Siege Train purposes. This small number is due to the famine of 1897- 1898. 75. The total number of mules on the Farm on 31st March 1902 was 204. During March, 16 were cast and sold as being too small and not likely to grow into Ordnance mules. The remainder are thriving and doing well. 76. A more liberal policy with regard to feeding the stock, has been adopted, and I think, with very few exceptions; the young stock now coming on will grow to the standard required either for Military purposes or district bulls. V.-BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 77. The control of the Muktesar Laboratory was transferred to this Department from the Indian Medical Service, on the 8th October 1901. 78. During the past year, further investigations have been carried out in the following diseases:9 but the results obtained were not satisfactory. This subject has been taken up by Mr. Stockman who will work in the field and I trust be able to prove the value or otherwise of the fungus. 87. Mallein.10 in India, 17 were removed from the Register, leaving a closing balance of 199. Number of stallions at work. 96. The number of stallions actually at work, vide Table V, (Provincial) was 192 against 177 in the previous year. The remaining 7 were purchased almost at the close of the year under report. Casualties. 97. A reference to Table III (Provincial) will show that 4 stallions died and 5 were destroyed; the percentage being 3.84 and 1.92 respectively. Sales. 98. Table IV (Provincial) will show that 8 stallions were sold during the year: the average price realized was R127. Cost of feed and keep. 99. Table IX (Provincial) will show that the cost of feed and keep was as follows:11 laboratory at Bareilly is in working order, as the accommodation for men under- going the course at this place is practically unlimited; whereas, Muktesar is only capable of accommodating 8 men at a time. The machinery to meet the anticipated demand for serum has been sanctioned, and it is hoped will be in working order at an early date. To effectually cope with outbreaks, it was necessary that the method of reporting should be much improved upon. This has been done and matters so arranged that Superintendents get telegraphic intimation direct from the office nearest to the scene of the outbreak. For many reasons it has been decided to abandon the " simultaneous " method and confine ourselves entirely to the "serum alone." Experience has proved that the latter is absolutely safe, effectually checks the disease and confers a period of immunity for several months; moreover, it does not offend caste prejudices. 108. A reference to Table XXIII (Provincial) will show that 44 outbreaks have been dealt with and 19,859 cattle inoculated. Out of this large number, only 161 died after inoculation. These casualties are in no way attributable to the method utilized and the animals which succumbed must in every case have had the disease germs in their system previous to the injection of serum. When dealing with rinderpest by the above method, the actual number of inocula- tions is no creterion of the total number of cattle saved. It must be taken into consideration that by effectually checking an outbreak we prevent disease spreading to the neighbouring herds and in this manner probably prevent large numbers of cattle contracting the disease. 109. Anthrax.12 India. The formation of a separate charge under a responsible officer, of all Veterinary Assistants employed, will ensure greater supervision being exercised over the work done by them and will also enable outbreaks of disease being promptly and carefully attended to. 117. Table XXI (Provincial) shows the number of animals treated by Veterinary Assistants in villages. The number of villages visited amounts to 30,677 and the total number of cattle treated by 221 Veterinary Assistants is reported to be 156,978. On comparing these figures with those of last year, it will be observed that a reduction of over 26,000 head of cattle is the result, showing that disease was not so prevalent as during the previous year. 118. During the year under report, 1 Veterinary Graduate has been sent by this Department as Veterinary Inspector to the Assam Valley Local Boards and is doing excellent work. He inoculated 581 head of cattle with anti-rinderpest serum during the last three months of his taking up his new appointment. One Veterinary Graduate has been sent as Veterinary Inspector of Perak in the Federated Malay States, and another will shortly leave to fill the post of Veterinary Inspector at Malacca. In addition to the above, 2 Veterinary Assistants have been sent to Port Blair and arrangements are now being made to send a third man to fill the last exising vacancy. IV.-CATTLE-BREEDING, ETC. CATTLE FAIRS AND SHOWS. 119. Very meagre reports have been received from the following places where Cattle Shows and Fairs were held during the past year :13 Until such scheme is in working order, the results achieved by supplying pure bred bulls from only two centres in India, viz., Hissar Farm (Harriana cattle) and Charodi Farm (Guzerat cattle) will be infinitesimal. V.-VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. VETERINARY COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS. 123. The main results of the working of the several Veterinary Colleges and Schools, will be found recorded in Table XXV (Provincial). 124. The total number of students passed out as qualified was 95; of these 27 were Veterinary Graduates from the Bombay and Bengal Veterinary Colleges, 25 Veterinary Assistants from the Rajputana and Burma Veterinary Schools, and 43 Salutris from the Bombay Veterinary College. Owing to the introduction of the three years' course at the Punjab Veterinary College no final examinations were held this year, 125. It is satisfactory to note that the Bombay Veterinary College has turned out 18 Veterinary Graduates this year, against 6 in the previous year. 126. The Examining Boards have reported very favourably of the results of the Punjab and Bengal Veterinary Colleges. The students of the Rajputana (Ajmer) Veterinary School were pronounced to be weak in practical knowledge. A thorough enquiry into the subject proved that this was not to be wondered at, as the extent of clinical practice obtainable at the Ajmer Veterinary School was practically nil. The question of the removal of the School to another locality, where sufficient practice is available, is now under consideration. VI.-GENERAL. Remarks. 127. The rules for Army Veterinary Department Officers serving in the Civil Veterinary Department were formally sanctioned and promulgated in August 1901, and all officers then serving in the Department, viz., 17, accepted them and elected for continuous service in India. 128. Owing to the fact that all further recruitment from the Army Veter- inary Department was stopped by the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for War, it was necessary that rules applicable to officers joining direct from the Veterinary Colleges should be brought into force as soon as possible. These rules were issued by the India Office in June 1901, and five officers have been appointed under them. 129. The present total strength of the Department is as follows:i TABLE I. IMPERIAL.
