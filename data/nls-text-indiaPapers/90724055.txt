Remarks by the Honourable the Agent to the Governor- General, Rajputana. The Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, will be asked to bring paragraphs 25 and 26 to the notice of the Municipal Committee of Ajmer. The improve- ment referred to in paragraph 21 was under consideration by the Municipal Committee when it was decided that owing to the financial stress occasioned by the war, the work should be postponed for the time. Paragraph 71-77. It is satisfactory to observe that there has been a substantial diminution of plague throughout Rajputana, and that many States as well as the district of Ajmer-Merwara have been free from the disease throughout the year. E. G. COLVIN, Agent to the Governor General, Rajputana. No. 726-CREPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES, AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1915, AND ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. SECTION I.-SANITATION AND VACCINATION. METEOROLOGY AND ITS RELATION TO FOOD SUPPLY. Rainfall in Ajmer. 1. During the year under report 14.35 inches of rain were registered inAjmer, against 19.62 inches in 1914. Owing to the scanty monsoon the tanks and wells were practically empty. Rainfall in Native States. 2. The rainfall recorded in Rajputana generally was unusually deficient;owing to which both the Khareef and Rabi Crops suffered. Scarcity of fodder prevailed throughout the province. VITAL STATISTICS, BIRTHS AND DEATHS. Births in Ajmer-Merwara. 3. Twentyone thousand nine hundred and fifty-three births were registeredin Ajmer-Merwara in 1915, against 23,515 in 19142 VITAL STATISTICS IN AJMER-MERWARA.

With the exception of three fatal cases (of which one occurred in AjmerCity in April and 2 in Pisangan town in June 1915), Ajmer-Merwara was free from cholera. Native States. 8. During the year 2,958 cases of cholera were reported from the NativeStates of Rajputana of which 1,978 proved fatal: against 3,185 seizures and 1,618 deaths in 1914. 9. In March 1915 cholera broke out in Jaipur, Bharatpur and Marwar about the same time and extended to Alwar, Bikaner, Kotah and Dholpur. 10. In Jaipur 497 attacks with 287 deaths were reported in 30 towns and villages from 11th March to 3rd December 1915, of which 56 cases and 52 deaths occurred in Jaipur City and its suburbs. 11. In Bharatpur 35 cases were reported in 4 towns and villages, including 4 cases and 3 deaths in Bharatpur City, from 12th March to 4th June 1915. 12. In Marwar 1,915 cases and 1,350 deaths were reported in 81 towns and villages from 25th March to 3rd September 1915. 13. Cholera was imported into Alwar by a resident, who had visited Hardwar fair where cholera was epidemic, 132 cases and 67 deaths were reported from 21st April to 29th August 1915. Of these 16 cases and 8 deaths occurred in Alwar City. 14. Cholera appeared first in Bikaner State on 27th April 1915 in Tehsil Hanumangarh, and afterwards in Bikaner City. The cause of the outbreak was infection brought from British territory where the disease was in epidemic form. 170 cases were reported of which 90 proved fatal, including 10 cases and 7 deaths in Bikaner City, upto 22nd June 1915. 15. In Kotah 122 seizures and 103 deaths were reported. The epidemic lasted for 35 days, from 12th August to 17th September 1915. In Dholpur 87 cases and 63 deaths occurred between 15th September and 8th November 1915. 16. The usual precautionary and preventive measures were adopted. 17. As the cholera outbreak in Rajputana was slight, no map has been attached to the report. SANITATION. Ajmer City conservancy. 18. Most of the unserviceable rolling stock has been replaced. Aproposal for sanction of some new conservancy carts has been submitted toreplace those which have become worn out. 19. A scheme for the substitution of movable galvanised iron latrines and urinals for the present masonry ones is under consideration. The number requires augmentation, to prevent the fouling of streets and lanes which goes on at present. Most of the privies and urinals in the city and suburbs have been provided with movable iron receptacles. 20. The night soil and rubbish of Ajmer are conveyed from the collecting station to the trenching ground by a steam tramway which was started on the 1st March 1915, replacing the former system of haulage of trucks by bullocks. 21. The main roads of the city and suburbs require attention, especially those bearing the brunt of the traffic. The dust raised from the roads leading from Kaisergunj to the Daulat Bagh and from the Telegraph office to the Kutchery (District Courts) is frequently so dense as to render progression difficult: and probably largely accounts for the prevalence of Catarrhal diseases of bronchial tubes, nose, throat and eyes. The roads should be paved or macadamised from one side to the other and foot paths provided for pedestrians. This would render both driving and walking safer than is now the case. 22. A scheme for surface drainage, which is badly wanted, is under consideration.
4 VITAL STATISTICS IN NATIVE STATES. 23. Three incinerators are working satisfactorily; it is proposed to construct more. 24. The covered drains in certain parts of the city are insanitary. They are kept as clean as possible. 25. The slaughter house, meat markets, and butchers shops still leave much to be desired. 26. The Birat system of scavenging is unsatisfactory. If the Birat sweepers could be brought under the control of the Municipal Committee this would go far to remedy matters. Apparently technical and legal difficulties preclude this arrangement. Water supply. 27. The Bhaonta water supply has been taken into use : and a separatepipe has been laid to the water tank on the Ana Sagar Ghati. 28. Beawar.VACCINATION IN RAJPUTANA. 5 operations against 1,060 operations in 1914-15, and the cost of each successful case fell from 44 pies to 38 pies in 1915-16. 39. The Civil Surgeon, Ajmer inspected 2,137 vaccinated children against 1,933 in the previous year of which 2,124 were found successful. The Superin- tendent of Vaccination at Nasirabad examined 745 children all of whom proved successful. 40. The Native Superintendent inspected 455 villages and examined 9,579 vaccinated children compared with 382 villages and 8,011 vaccinations in 1914-15. The percentage of success amongst cases seen was 97.46 against 97.02 in the previous year. 41. 33.44 per thousand of the population in Ajmer-Merwara were successfully vaccinated against 29.81 in 1914-15.General operations in Native States. 42. The vaccination returns from the Native States show 270,224 primaryvaccinations against 273,077 in 1914-15 a decrease of 2,853. Revaccination fellfrom 427 in 1914-15 to 348 owing to the non-prevalence of small pox in epidemic form. 43. There were 162 vaccinators against 160 in the previous year, two additional vaccinators having been employed one in Kotah, and one in Jaisalmer. No vaccinator was employed in Deoli Cantonment during the season ; vaccinations were performed by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon attached to the Agency Hospital there. 44. In the Marwar State 249 primary vaccinations were performed by Sub-Assistant Surgeons in Dispensary towns with a recorded per centage success of 95.18 and 208 vaccination operations by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Sirohi. 45. 25.05 per thousand of the population in the Native States were successfully vaccinated against 25.29 in 1914-15. STATEMENT II. Expenditure on vaccination. 46. The total expenditure on vaccination in Native States was R35,011-9-8as compared with R 32,160-7-10, an increase of R 2,851-1-10 due toincreased expenditure on establishment and travelliug allowance. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 17 pies in Alwar, Kotah and Partabgarh to 108 pies in Jaisalmer. 47. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspected and successful vaccination seen by Residency or Agency Surgeons in Native States:6 VACCINATION AND DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 49. The Native Superintendents of Vaccinations and other inspecting officers in Native States inspected 1,08,006 vaccinations against 1,07,157 in 1914-15. The percentage of inspected cases found successful among the total number seen in 1915-16 was 98.92 against 98.79 in 1914-15. 50. Lymph is kept up throughout the year in most of the important States by arm to arm vaccination ; glycerinated vaccine lymph was obtained during the year from the Government Bovine Lymph Depots and was gener- ally satisfactory. 51. The Residency Surgeon, Jaipur, writes that proposals made last year to the State Council for the abolition of arm to arm vaccination and establish- ment of Buffalo Calf lymph prepared at the Mayo Hospital, Jaipur, for vaccination work are still under the consideration of the Durbar. SECTION II.DISPENSARIES IN RAJPUTANA. 7 STATEMENT B. Attendance at Hospitals. 64. During the year 1915 the number of patients treated at State Public, State Special and Private non-aided institutions, i. e., Native States Dispen- saries and Hospitals amounted to 1,492,472 against, 1,520,785 in 1914, a decrease of 28,313; for which the healthiness of the year is responsible. The total indoor attendance fell from 19,397 in 1914 to 18,976 in 1915 ; and the out-door attendance decreased to 1,473,496 from 1,501,388 in 1914. The number of deaths fell from 687 in 1914 to 642 in 1915 : and the ratio of deaths per cent. of total treated fell from 3.55 to 3.38. STATEMENTS C (I) AND C (II). Diseases treated. 65. In Statement C (I) the number of deaths under each head of diseases treated in the in-door department is shown ; 18,976 in-patients were treated with a mortality of 642, against 19,397 inpatients and 687 deaths in 1914. 66. 156 normal confinements with 1 death, and 132 abnormal confine- ments with 5 deaths were reported from the various hospitals, as compared with 171 with 3 deaths, and 141 with 6 deaths respectively in 1914. 67. 1,473,496 out-door patients treated in 1915 are shown in Statement C (II) as compared with 1,501,388 in 1914. The cases treated in hospitals and dispensaries in Rajputana under each chief disease during the year 1913, 1914 and 1915 are as follows :8 PLAGUE IN RAJPUTANA. Plague. 71. During the year from 1st April 1915 to 31st March 1916, 135 plague seizures and 109 deaths were reported in 17 towns and villages infected in the Native States in Rajputana, against 570 cases and 458 deaths in 44 towns and villages in 1914-15. The district of Ajmer-Merwara remained free from plague throughout the year. 72. The disease lingered from the preceding year until May 1915 in Marwar, and up to June in Bharatpur State. Afterwards only imported cases were reported in Marwar, Sirohi, and Mewar in which 8 imported cases with 3 deaths occurred up to the end of the year under report. 73. In Bharatpur 69 cases and 55 deaths were reported in 7 towns and villages, as compared with 198 cases and 122 deaths in 16 towns and villages in 1914-15. The Bharatpur City remained free from plague. 74. No indigenous plague existed in Jaipur and Alwar States during the year under report. Only 2 imported cases and 1 death were reported in the former and 1 fatal case in the latter in April 1915. Jaipur and Alwar City were free from the disease throughout the year. 75. The guard room, dispensary and kitchen at the Jaipur plague camp which consisted of mud huts with thatched or iron roofing, have been replaced by new buildings with &quot;pise&quot; walls on stone in mud foundations. The new huts have been roofed with corrugated iron sheets on iron trusses erected on pipe pillars. 76. No inoculations were performed during the year. 77. The value of evacuation is now generally recognised and directly some deaths take place in a Muhalla of a town or in a village the people voluntarily leave their homes. 78. As the plague outbreak in Rajputana was slight no map has been attached with this report. Snake poisoning. 79. Calmette's Anti-venine is kept in stock in most of the main dispensaries and used for the treatment of snake-poisoning when opportunity offers. A case of recovery under Antivenene injection is reported from Victoria Hospital, Bharatpur; but the species of snake is not mentioned, nor are any particulars furnished regarding the case. STATEMENT F. 80. Shows the classes and sexes of both in-door and out-door patients treated in the dispensaries of Ajmer-Merwara and of Native States. This calls for no comment as it is merely introduced for statistical purposes. STATEMENT G. 81.
