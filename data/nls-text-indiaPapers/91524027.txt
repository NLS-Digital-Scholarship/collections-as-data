No. 784S. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL A. STEPHEN, M.B., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 18th May 1897. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Vaccination Statements of the Province of Assam for the year 1896-97, with the following remarks :2 be successful. The small percentage of successful primary vaccinations in this district was due to the bad work done by the vaccinator of the Mokokchang Sub-division, whose services were afterwards dispensed with. In the Resolution on the Vaccination Report of 1895-96 the Chief Commissioner observed that in the Bengal Report for 1894-95 it was stated that many vaccinators in that province excluded unsuccessful operations from their lists, and he requested the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner to give this matter his careful consideration, and to record the result of his enquiries in the next Vaccination Report. A Circular was accordingly sent to all Civil Surgeons, requesting them to take care that vaccinators did not exclude unsuc- cessful vaccinations from their lists, and directing them to notice what action they had taken, with results, in their annual reports. In connection with this Circular all Civil Surgeons have reported that they were satisfied that all unsuccessful operations were included in the returns. Proportion of the population suc- cessfully vaccinated. 6. Including successful vaccinations done by tea-garden agencies, 45.71 per 1,000 of the population were successfully vaccinated during the year, as against 42.97 per 1,000 successfully vaccinated in 1895-96, and 33.50 per 1,000, the average proportion successfully vaccinated during the previous five years. Dispensary vaccination. 7. The details of vaccinations done by dispensary establishments are given in Statement No. III. From the statement it appears that these establishments did 7,590 primary vaccinations and 482 re-vaccinations, a total of 8,072 operations. The percentages of primary vaccina- tions and re-vaccinations found successful were, respectively, 94 26 and 76.35. In 1895-96, dispensary establishments did 10,005 primary vaccinations and 451 re-vaccin- ations, and the percentages of successful operations were, respectively, 95.08 and 82.26. Vaccinations in tea-gardens. 8. The details of vaccination work done in tea gardens by Government vaccinators and tea-garden agencies are given in the following table :3 and Jagcherra gardens, only 103 were reported to have been successful. As the lymph supplied from the Shillong depôt was reported by all Civil Surgeons to have been excellent, the very poor results obtained in these gardens could not have been due to bad lymph. Excluding these 2,398 cases, the percentage of successful operations among the other 13,876 vaccinations, done by tea-garden agencies, was 96.35. Total number of vaccinations done in each district. 9. The following table gives the amount of work done by all agencies in theProvince during the years 1895-96 and 1896-97 :4 Primary vaccinations done success- fully at different age periods. 12. Excluding work done by the tea-garden agencies, and 124 vaccinations done by the dispensary establishment of the Darrang District, regarding whom the Civil Surgeon failed to obtain the necessary information, 45,865 infants under one year of age, 145.955 children between the ages of one and six years, and 52,618 persons over six years of age were successfully vaccinated during the year for the first time, as against 47,176 infants, 131,507 children between the ages of one and six years, and 52,822 persons over six years of age success- fully vaccinated for the first time in 1895-96. Percentages found successful by inspecting officers. 13. The particulars of vaccinations verified by inspecting officers is given in State- ment No. V. Excluding 16,274 operations done by tea- garden agencies, 258,422 persons were vaccinated during the year, and of these, 20,630 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 157,386 by Native Inspectors of Vaccination. Civil Surgeons found that 98.38 per cent. of the 20,630 vaccinations inspected by them were successful, and of the 157,386 operations in- spected by the Native Inspectors, 153,728, or 97.68 per cent., were successful. Vaccin- ators reported that 97.58 per cent. of the primary operations done by them were suc- cessful, a proportion slightly less than that found by Native Inspectors, and distinctly less than that found by Civil Surgeons, to be successful. During the previous year Civil Surgeons inspected 29,886 and Native Inspectors 158,915 operations, so that during the year under review 9,256 fewer operations were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 1,529 fewer by Native Inspectors than during 1895-96. The largest number of inspections, 3,379, was made by Surgeon-Major Dobson, the Civil Surgeon of the Goal- para District. The Civil Surgeons of Sibsagar and Lakhimpur inspected 3,212 and 2,714 operations, respectively. Surgeon-Major Fink inspected 2,506 out of the 8,340 vaccinations done in the Garo Hills District. Very few operations were inspected by the Civil Medical Officers of the Cachar and Nowgong districts. The Civil Medical Officer of the Cachar District was in medical charge of the wing of the 17th Bengal Infantry, at Silchar, during a portion of the vaccinating season, and the Civil Medical Officer of Nowgong met with an accident in February 1897 and was unable to do any inspection work during the remainder of the vaccinating season. Only seventeen vac- cinations were inspected by the Civil Surgeon of the Naga Hills District. Percentage of work of licensed vaccinators found successful. 14. The following table gives the number of operations, done by licensed vaccina- tors, inspected by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors during the year.

5 From the table it appears that 23,110 operations were done by licensed vaccina- tors during the year, aad that of these, 3,730 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 13,581 by Native Inspectors. Civil Surgeons found that 97.21 per cent., and Native Inspectors that 99.37 per cent., of the operations inspected by them were successful. The results of these inspections show that the work of licensed vaccinators was quite as good as the work done by paid men. Sixteen per cent. of the work of licensed vaccinators was inspected during the year by Civil Surgeons and 59 per cent. by Native Inspectors, as against 13 per cent. inspected by Civil Surgeons and 44 per cent. by Native Inspectors during 1895-96. Not a single operation done by licensed vaccinators was inspected by the Civil Surgeon of the Kamrup District. Places in which vaccination is compulsory. 15. The results obtained in municipalities, stations, and unions, in which the Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force, are given in the following table :6 In 1896-97, the Compulsory Vaccination Acts were in force in ten towns in Assam with an aggregate population of 66,313. In these ten towns 4,222 vaccinations were done during the vaccinating season, and of these operations, 3,685 were successful. During 1895-96, 3,828 successful vaccinations were performed in the same towns out of a total of 4,161 operations done. In 1896,59 small-pox deaths were reported in the ten towns in which the Acts were in force, a death-rate of 0.89 per 1,000. Of these deaths, 25 occurred in Dibrugarh and twelve in Sibsagar. The small-pox death- rate of the Province as a whole, in 1896, was 1.09 per 1,000. There were 618 notices issued under the Acts during the year, but not a single person was prosecuted. In 1895-96, 779 notices were issued, 73 prosecutions were instituted, and ten persons were punished. Silchar Municipality. 16. In this municipality 185 vaccinations were performed and 156 of the opera- tions were successful. In 1895-96, 181 persons were suc- cessfully vaccinated. There were two small-pox deaths registered during 1896. Nine notices were issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. Sylhet Municipality. 17. In Sylhet 559 persons were vaccinated during the year, with a successful result in each case. In 1895-96,442 persons were success- fully vaccinated in this municipality. The notices issued under the Act numbered 480, but not a single person was prosecuted. Seven deaths from small-pox were registered in Sylhet during 1896. Dhubri Municipality. 18. There were 167 vaccinations done in this municipality, with a successful result in 154 cases. In the previous season 134 persons were successfully vaccinated. No notices were issued under the Act, and not a single death from small-pox was registered during the year. Goalpara Municipality. 19. In Goalpara 142 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 169 in the previous season. Seventy-one notices were issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. No small-pox deaths were registered in this town during the year. Gauhati Municipality. 20. In this municipality 528 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 572 in 1895-96. No notices were issued under the Act. Seven deaths from small-pox were registered in 1896. Dibrugarh Municipality and Can- tonment. 21. There were 436 successful vaccinations done in the municipality and nineteen in the cantonment during the year, as against 1,269 suc- cessful operations done in the municipality and eighteen in the cantonment in 1895-96. In 1895 there was a severe outbreak of small-pox in Dibrugarh, and special means were taken to perform as many vaccinations as possible. In that year 115 small-pox deaths were recorded in the municipality and cantonment. In spite of the large number of vaccinations done, the disease was not stamped out, and 25 deaths from this cause were recorded in 1896. During 1896,58 notices were issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. Sibsagar Station. 22. There were 403 persons successfully vaccinated in this station, as against 394 in 1895-96. No notices were issued under the Act. Twelve small-pox deaths were registered during the year. Shillong Station and Cantonment. 23. In the Shillong Station and Cantonment 840 persons were successfully vaccin- ated, as against 387 in the previous year. No notices were issued under the Act, and no small-pox deaths were registered during the year. Golaghat Union. 24. One hundred and fifty-six persons were successfully vaccinated in this union; as against 104 in 1895-96. No notices were issued under the Act. Two small-pox deaths were reported in' 1896. Jorhat Unin. 25. In this union 292 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 158 in 1895-96. No notices were issued under the Act. Four small-pox deaths were registered in Jorhat during 1896.
7 Inoculation. 26. As noted in last year's report, inoculation continues to be frequently practised in the Surma Valley. The Civil Medical Officer of Silchar stated in his report that it is much practised in his district, but he gave no details. He stated that no outbreak of small-pox had been proved to originate directly from inoculation. The Civil Surgeon of Sylhet stated that inocu- lation had been carried on more widely in all sub-divisions of his district in 1896 than in previous years. He reported that there was reason to believe that an outbreak of small- pox in Burunga Village, in the north Sylhet Sub-division, was due to inoculation. The matter was brought to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner, but he replied that he could not do anything in the matter. The Civil Surgeon of Lakhimpur reported that, without doubt, inoculation was extensively practised among certain sections of the population in his district. One man was prosecuted during the year for inoculating, and was fined Rs. 60. He stated that he was unable to furnish any statistics regard- ing the mortality, direct or indirect, originating from inoculation, as small-pox was prevalent throughout the district, and it was impossible to say whether particular cases contracted the infection from cases of ordinary small-pox or from inoculated cases. The Civil Surgeon of the Garo Hills stated that inoculation was practised to a certain extent in his district. In all other districts Civil Surgeons reported that there was no evidence that inoculation was practised in their districts. Mortality from small-pox compar- ed, district by distric , with the amount of protection obtained by successful vaccination 27. In order to compare the death-rate from small-pox registered in 1896, district by district, with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccinations done during the seven years, 1890-91 to 1896-97, the following diagram has been pre- pared in accordance with orders conveyed in Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 49, dated the 8th February 1894. From the diagram it appears that the death-rate from small-pox was highest in the Lakhimpur District, in which the largest proportion of the inhabitants was successfully vaccinated during the last seven years, and that the small-pox death-rate was also comparatively very high in the Sibsagar District, in which the next highest proportion of inhabitants was protected. As pointed out in last year's report, the proportion of the inhabitants protected by successful vaccination is still comparatively small, and as means of com- munication in the interior of districts in Assam is comparatively difficult, small-pox is frequently not seen in considerable tracts of country for several years in succession, and when it is introduced into these tracts, very severe outbreaks result.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE9 Animal Lymph Depôt at Shillong. 28. The annual report of the Bovine Vaccine Depôt at Shillong is given as Appendix A to this report. Including Rs. 760-4-7 debited to the Manipur State, the expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 7,252-12-5, as against Rs. 7,217-3-11 in 1895-96, an increase of Rs. 35-8-6. The expenditure on calves was considerably less than it was in the previous year, Rs. 2,608, as against Rs. 2,904, but the cost of vaccine tubes rose from Rs. 1,981-11-1 in 1895-96 to Rs. 2,274-2-4 in 1896-97. There were 316,933 tubes loaded at the depôt, as against 239,386 loaded in the previous year. On an average 11,900 loaded tubes were sent weekly to Civil Surgeons during the vaccinating season. All Civil Surgeons reported that the lymph received by them from the depôt throughout the season was of excellent quality. I inspected a good many vaccinations at the different places which I visited during my cold weather tour, and the results were in all cases satisfactory. Much credit is due to Surgeon-Major Carroll for the interest he has taken in the depôt and for the very efficient manner in which he has supervised it during the year. He states that the hospital assistant in subordinate charge, Chandra Nath Chand, did excellent work during the year. Results obtained with lanoline lymph. 29. Small supplies of vaccine lymph, preserved in lanoline, were sent in December 1896 to the Civil Surgeons of Goalpara, Kamrup, Darrang, Sibsagar, Lakhimpur and Sylhet, with the request that they would arrange to have vaccine operations done in their presence with the lymph, and that they would afterwards submit reports on the results obtained. From the reports it appears that the results obtained from lymph preserved in lanoline and glycerine are practically the same. The Civil Surgeons of Goalpara and Sibsagar found that after it was kept for some time lymph preserved in lanoline became inert, and from previous experience it is known that under similar conditions lymph preserved in glycerine also becomes inert. Lymph preserved in glycerine is distributed in hermetically sealed tubes, which are not opened till the lymph is about to be used, so that the lymph cannot become contaminated. Lymph preserved in lanoline is, on the other hand, distributed in small boxes, and, on the boxes being opened, the lymph might become contaminated with noxious matters. This risk of contamination, in my opinion, counterbalances the advantage possessed by lanoline lymph over glycerine lymph on the ground of cheapness, and I therefore do not recom- mend the use of lanoline lymph in this province, instead of lymph preserved in glycerine. Fresh animal lymph. 30. As lymph of inferior quality was sent from the Shillong depôt to districts during a portion of the vaccinating season of 1893-94, and again in 1894-95, it was considered to be advisable to arrange to have an independent source of supply in each district. The Chief Com- missioner accordingly directed that arrangements should be made with a view to adopting the method of vaccinating with fresh calf lymph. A Circular was sent to all Civil Surgeons in June 1896, giving the details of the method of inoculating calves with vac- cine lymph, and requesting them to make an attempt to use this method of vaccinating children at the head-quarters stations of their districts during the ensuing vaccinating season. The difficulty of obtaining calves for this purpose was, however, so great and the caste prejudices of the vaccinators were so strong that the attempt to carry on vaccination work by this method had to be given up. Arm-to-arm vaccination. 31. In connection with the concluding portion of the third paragraph of the Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1895-96, Civil Surgeons were requested to notice in their reports to what extent arm-to-arm vaccination was still practised in their districts and to compare the results with those obtained with animal lymph. From the reports received, it appears that during the past season arm-to-arm vaccination was used only in the Sylhet and Sibsagar Districts. In the Sylhet District, 4,059 cases of arm-to-arm vaccination were performed, with a successful result in every case. In the Sibsagar District, out of 41,283 operations performed, 13,710 were done by the arm-to-arm method. The Civil Surgeon did not, however, state what proportion of the arm-to-arm cases was successful. The result must have been satisfactory, as 99.38 per cent. of the primary vaccinations done by the vaccinators and dispensary staffs in the district were successful. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
APPENDICES AND STATEMENTS.
13 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, for the year 1896-97. Total expenditure. 1. The total expenditure for the year was Rs. 6,492-7-10, being less than that of the year before by Rs. 52-2-7. The diminution would have been greater, had not capillary tubes cost Rs. 354-4-8 more this year. Petty construction and repairs. 2. A sum of Rs. 159-8 was expended on petty construction and repairs. Animals. 3. During the year, 411 calves were bought at a net- cost of Rs. 2,608, of which Rs. 384 have been charged to Manipur. After vaccination, the calves were sold back to the contractors for Rs. 2 each throughout the year. The account of the calves is as follows: UNPROTECTED CALVES.

Expenditure on calves.Of this amount, vaccine tubes cost 5. The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 2,608, while in the preceding year it was Rs. 2,904. Cost of feeding. 6. The calves' food cost Rs. 314-10, compared with Rs. 284-5-6 in 1895-96. Miscellaneous. 7. The expenditure under the head&quot; Miscellaneous&quot; was Rs. 2,513-5-10, against Rs. 2,076-6-8 in 1895-96. Of this amount, vaccine tubes cost Rs. 2,041-1-9, service stamps and telegrams Rs. 75-13, and contingencies Rs. 396-7-1. In 1895-96, the amount paid for vaccine tubes was Rs. 1,686-13-1, for service stamps and telegrams Rs. 51-6, and for contingencies Rs. 338-3-7. Establishment. 8. The establishment consists of a second-grade hospital assistant, with a special allowance of Rs. 20 a month, a clerk at Rs. 10, a loader at Rs. 12, a coolie at Rs. 9, and a coolie and sweeper at Rs. 9 each, engaged for seven months only. An additional coolie at Rs. 9 is paid for by Manipur. E
14 The coolies and sweeper drew Re. 1 each as compensation for dearness of grain for four months of the year. The cost of the establishment was as follows : Rs. Hospital assistant ......................... 765 Other establishment ................... 516 Additional coolie for 7 months paid by Manipur .............. 68 Inoculation of calves. 9. Four hundred and thirty-five calves were inoculated. In four of these the operation failed, 20 died before lymph could be taken and from 57 lymph was not taken for various reasons, such as illness, inflammation of the vaccinated area, or imperfection in the vesicles. Number of tubes loaded. 10. The number of tubes loaded was 316,923, the average per calf being 895.26. In 1895-96, the number was 239,386 and the average 822.6. Distribution of lymph. 11. Lymph was distributed to all Civil Surgeons in the provinces including Manipur and the North Lushai Hills. The ordinary weekly supply to the various districts is given below: Tubes. Sylhet ............................. 3,000 Cachar ....................... 800 Lakhimpur ...................... 800 Kamrup .............................. 1,500 Golapara ......................... 1,000 Darrang ..................... 900 Nowgong .......................... 800 Sibsagar ............................... 1,000 Naga Hills ....................... 500 Garo Hills ...................... 600 North Lushai Hills ....................... 100 Manipur ......................... 600 Khsi and Jaintia Hills ................. 300 in the cold weather. 150 in the hot weather. In addition to the above, occasional supplies were sent, on requistion, to the medical officers of native regiments, medical officers of tea gardens, missionaries and others. Quality of the lymph. 12. The quality of the lymph supplied has been uniformly good and no unfavourable report has been received. 13. Hospital Assistant Chandra Nath Chand has again done excellent work during the past year. E. R. W. CARROLL, Surgeon-Major, Civil Surgeon, Shillong. Shillong, The 13th April 1897.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 4647, dated Shillong, the 20th July 1897. Read2 should be supplemented so as to guard against possible accidents at the central depôt, and further efforts should, therefore, be made to carry out vaccinations with fresh lymph. Arm-to-arm vaccination appears to have been tried only in two districts, Sibsagar and Sylhet, and in both with apparently excellent results. 3. The proportion of the population successfully vaccinated during the year was 4.57 per cent., against 4.29 in 1895-96. The vaccination of infants under one year of age showed a falling off, viz., 45,865, against 47,176 in the previous year. During the calendar year 1896, 169,172 births were registered in Assam, and in the Census Report of 1891 the number of children under one year of age was stated to be 191,720. The proportion of infants successfully vaccinated was thus 27.1 per cent. of the registered birth-rate, and 23.9 per cent. of the estimated number of infants available for vaccination. 4. The number of recorded deaths from small-pox in the ten towns in which Com- pulsory Vaccination Acts are in force was 59, or .89 per thousand, in 1896, against 132, or 1.92 per thousand, in 1895 ; the corresponding figures for the province as a whole were 1.09 and 0.77 per thousand, respectively. From the diagram given in paragraph 27 of the report, it would appear that 2,686 persons of every 10,000 of the population in the plains districts had been protected during the seven years ending 1896-97. The recorded death-rate was highest in the Lakhimpur district, in which the largest proportion of the inhabitants had been protected, and, excepting Kamrup, the death- rate in Sibsagar was higher than in any of the remaining districts, although the protection afforded in that district was greater than in any other except Lakhimpur. Looking, however, to the small proportion of persons who are protected, it is evident that very little importance can be attached to these figures. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam E. A. GAIT, Offg. Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam,

SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward the Vaccination Statements for the year 1897- 98, with the following remarks. Number of vaccinators employed. 2. Annual Statement No. I gives the average number of vaccinators employed in each district, as well as details of work done by paid and licensed vaccinators. There were on an average 18 In- spectors, 182 paid and 30 licensed vaccinators and ten apprentices employed during the year, as against 18 Inspectors, 175 paid and 28 licensed vaccinators, and 6 apprentices in 1896-97. A licensed vaccinator was appointed in the Cachar district. In the Sylhet district an additional paid vaccinator and 3 additional apprentices were employed. In the Goalpara district the paid vaccinator was dismissed and 2 additional licensed vaccinators were appointed. In the Kamrup district 4 additional paid vaccinators were appointed and the services of one of the licensed vaccinators were dispensed with. In the Darrang district an additional apprentice was appointed. In the Nowgong district two additional paid vaccinators were appointed, and in the Naga Hills district an extra paid vaccinator was employed. Amount of work done by paid and licensed vaccinators. 3. During the season, 255,583 persons were vaccinated by paid and licensed vaccinators, of whom 143,468 were males and 112,115 were females. During 1896-97, 250,350 vaccinations were done, so that 5,233 more operations were done during 1897-98 than during the previous year. Of the vaccinations done during 1897-98, 245,381 were primary and 10,202 were cases of re-vaccination, as against 243,307 primary vaccinations and 7,043 re-vaccinations done during the previous season. There were thus 2,074 more primary vaccinations and 3,159 more re-vaccinations done by the vacci- nation staff than during 1896-97. Of those successfully vaccinated, 55,574 were infants under one year of age, as against 44,472 infants successfully vaccinated during 1896-97. Percentage of operations found to be successful. 4. Of the 245,381 primary vaccinations done by paid and licensed vaccinators, 242,871, or 98.98 per cent., were reported to be successful, and of the 10,202 re-vaccinations, 9,391, or 92.05 per cent., were successful. In 1896-97, 97.58 per cent. of the primary vaccinations and 94.25 per cent. of the re-vaccinations were stated to have been successful. In the Nowgong district, 16,537 out of 16,543 primary vaccinations done were reported to be successful. I inspected a considerable number of primary vaccinations in this district, and though the work was, on the whole, excellent, several of the vaccinations were unsuc- cessful. I have requested the Civil Medical Officer of this district to examine the vaccinators' registers of selected villages, to inspect all the children, whose names are entered in the registers, present in these villages, and to let me know how many of the children entered in the lists were produced, and how many of those produced were found to be successfully vaccinated. With the exception of the results obtained in the Naga and North Lushai Hills, in which the percentages of successful primary cases were, respectively, 94.28 and 93.61, the proportion of cases reported to be successful in the province was very high. Proportion of population suc- cessfully vaccinated. 5. Including successful vaccinations done by tea-garden agencies, 46.67 per 1,000 of the population of Assam were successfully vaccinated during the year, as compared with 45.71 per 1,000 success- fully vaccinated in 1896-97, and 34.12 per 1,000 success- fully vaccinated on an average during the previous five vaccinating seasons. B
2 Cost of the department. 6. The total cost of the Department for the year was Rs. 22,345-12-10, as against Rs 21,723-9-1 in 1896-97, an increase of Rs. 622-3-9. The pay of Inspectors and of vaccinators amounted to Rs. 3,847-1-8 and Rs. 14,531-10-1, respectively, as compared with Rs. 3,783-4-10 and Rs. 13,630-0-0, the respective sums expended under these heads during 1896-97. During the year Rs. 2,974-8-6 were spent on travelling allowances and Rs. 992-8-7 on contingencies. The increase in the expenditure was due to 7 additional paid vaccinators and 4 apprentices having been appointed during the year. Of the total expenditure, Rs. 8,316-0-3 were met from Provincial. Rs. 11,819-9-4 from Local and Rs. 847-15-11 from Municipal Funds, and Rs. 1,362-3-4 were contributed by the Manipur State There were 218,516 persons successfully vaccinated by paid vaccinators, so that the cost of each successful vaccination done by these men was one anna and eight pies. In 1896-97, the cost of each successful vaccination, including the work of 18 licensed vaccinators who received rewards, was one anna and six pies. Dispensary vaccinations. 7. Statement No. III gives the details of dispensary vaccination done during the year. The dispensary staff did 16,172 primary vaccinations and 1,005 re-vaccinations, a total of 17,177 operations, as against 8,072 operations done in 1896-97, an increase of 9,105 cases. The percentages of primary cases and re-vaccinations found to be successful were, respectively, 97.66 and 79.90, as against 94.26 and 76.35, the corresponding percentages found successful in 1896-97. Tea-garden vaccinations 8. The following statement gives the details of vaccination work on tea gardens by garden agencies and Government vaccinators.

The table shows that 11,154 persons were primarily vaccinated in tea gardens during the year by tea-garden agencies and 907 by Government vaccinators, a total of 12,061 cases. Of these vaccinations, 11,589, or 96.09 per cent., were done successfully. In the report for last year it was stated that 16,274 operations were done by tea-garden agencies, of which 82.79 per cent. were successful. Further enquiries showed that three gardens in the Sylhet district furnished incorrect returns in 1896-97, and that there were actually 13,981 vaccinations done by tea-garden agencies, of which 13,473, or 96.37 per cent., were successful.

In the report for 1896-97, it was observed that more vaccinations had been done in that year than in any previous year ; the returns show that 9,218 more operations were done during the year under review than during 1896-97. Districts in which the greatest increase occurred. 10. In the Goalpara district 7,616 more vaccinations were done than in the previous year. The Civil Surgeon reports that the in- crease was principally due to the efficient assistance given to the vaccinators by Mr. Ward, the District Superintend- ent of Police. Six thousand four hundred and fifty-two more operations were done in the Nowgong district than during the previous year Small-pox appeared in this district in epidemic form during the year, and the Civil Medical Officer, Surgeon- Captain Mac Naught, took considerable personal interest in the work and did what he could to overcome the prejudices of the inhabitants of many villages who were opposed to vaccination. The increase in the number of operations done in the Sylhet and Darrang districts, and in the Manipur State, 5,938, 2,338, and 2,431, respectively, was very satisfactory. Districts in which the greatest decrease occurred. 11. The returns show that 8,259 fewer operations were done in the Sibsagar district than in the previous year. Notwithstanding this decrease, the amount of work done in this district was com- paratively very large, and 68.16 per 1,000 of the population were reported to have been successfully vaccinated by the paid and licensed vaccinators. The returns for 1896-97 show that 4,298 fewer vaccinations were done in the Kamrup district than in the previous year, and this year's returns show that 1,429 fewer operations were done than in 1896-97. The Civil Surgeon is of opinion that the decrease was due partly to the great prevalence of cholera, but principally to the migration of the people in consequence of the floods which occurred after the earthquake. In the Naga Hills 1,457 fewer operations were done than during the previous year. The returns show 5,120 fewer operations done by tea-garden agency on tea gardens. Last year incorrect returns were furnished by three tea gardens, and the actual decrease in 1897-98 was only 2,827. Percentages found successful by inspecting officers. 12. Statement No. V shows the particulars of vaccination work verified by inspect- ing officers for the year. Excluding 11,154 vaccinations by tea-garden agencies, 272,760 persons were vaccinated during the season, and of these, 24,207 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and Civil Medical Officers and 150,005 by Native Inspectors of Vaccination. Civil Surgeons found that 98.66 per cent., and Native Inspectors that 2B
4 98.14 per cent., of the operations inspected by them were successful. Vaccinators reported that 98.98 per cent. of the primary vaccinations done by them were success- ful. During 1896-97, Civil Surgeons found that 98.38 per cent., and Native Inspectors that 97.68 per cent., of the vaccinations inspected by them were successful Unless sufficient care is taken, vaccinators are apt to bring forward only successful cases for the scrutiny of inspecting officers ; and efforts should be made to examine all the persons vaccinated belonging to the villages inspected. In order that the same method may be followed by all inspecting officers in the province in future. I have requested them, when furnishing particulars of operations inspected by them, to state (a) the number of towns and villages to which the vaccinated persons inspected by them belonged, (b) the number of persons belonging to these towns and villages primarily vac- cinated during the season as given in vaccinators' registers, (c) the number of vaccinated persons belonging to these towns and villages inspected by inspecting officers, and (d) the number of vaccinations inspected found to be successful. By insisting on seeing all the persons vaccinated during the season present in places inspected, inspecting officers will not only be able to determine what proportion of the work done has been successful, but they will also find out whether the vaccinators' registers are accurately kept. I examined a considerable number of vaccinations in the plains districts during my cold-weather tour, and the work was, on the whole, excellent. As in the previous year, the largest number of inspections, 7,717, was made by Surgeon- Major Dobson, the Civil Surgeon of the Goalpara district, who has given much attention to vaccination work in his district. A considerable amount of inspection work was also done by the Civil Surgeons of the Sibsagar, Sylhet, Nowgong and Kamrup districts. The Civil Surgeons of the Naga Hills and Khasi and Jaintia Hills districts made very few inspections. No operations were inspected by the Civil Surgeon of the Garo Hills. The medical duties of this district were carried on by a hospital assistant during the vaccinating season, and he was unable to leave the headquarters station of the district. Percentage of work of licensed vaccinators found to be successful. 13. The results of the inspection by Civil Surgeons and Native Inspectors of work done by licensed vaccinators are given in the following table : Table showing the number of licensed vaccinators' operations inspected by the Civil Surgeons and Native Inspector during the year 1897-98.

Civil Surgeons found that 99.04 and Native Inspectors that 99.73 per cent. of the operations inspected by them were successful In 1896-97, the corresponding per- centages found successful were 97.21 and 99.37. The attention of Civil Surgeons was called to the importance of closely scrutinizing the work of licensed vaccinators in this office Circular No. 48., dated the 10th of October 1897. The Civil Surgeon of Goalpara inspected a large number of vaccinations done by these men, but the para- graph of the circular referring to this subject appears to have escaped the notice of the Civil Surgeons of Cachar, Kamrup and Sibsagar. They have been requested to state why they failed to carry out the instructions contained in the circular.

Sylhet 6 The Compulsory Acts were in force in eleven places, with a population of 71,128, during the season under review. Act XIII of 1880 was brought into force in the Nowgong Municipality on the 7th of April 1897. In these towns, 3,487 vaccinations were performed with a successful result in 3,371 cases. During 1896-97, 3,685 successful vaccinations were done in ten towns with a population of 66,313. Twenty-nine small- pox deaths occurred in these eleven towns in 1897, a death-rate of 0.41 per 1,000. The small-pox death-rate of the province as a whole was 1.08 per 1,000. Of the deaths, 16 occurred in Sibsagar, and 5 in Jorhat. During the year, 594 notices were issued under the Acts, 25 persons were prosecuted and 2 were punished. During the previous year, 618 notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted. Silchar Municipality. 15. In Silchar, 208 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 156 in 1896-97. No death from small-pox was reported during 1897. Thirteen notices were issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. Sylhet Municipality. 16. Only 365 persons were successfully vaccinated in Sylhet, as against 559 in 1896-97. There were 470 notices issued, 105 more than the number of persons vaccinated, and yet not a single prosecution was instituted. Two deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. Dhubri Municipality. 17. In Dhubri, 105 successful vaccinations were performed, as against 154 in 1896-97. Four notices were issued under the Act, but no one was prosecuted. One death resulted from small- pox during the year. Goalpara Municipality. 18. Ninety-eight successful vaccinations were done in this municipality, as against 142 in the previous year. Forty-three notices were issued and 15 persons were prosecuted, but no one was convicted. No small-pox death was registered during the year. Gauhati Municipality. 19. In Gauhati, 72 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 528 in the previous year. There were no notices issued under the Act. Two small-pox deaths were registered. Nowgong Municipality 20. In this municipality, into which the Act was brought into force during the year, 553 persons out of a population of 4,815 were reported to have been successfully vaccinated. Three notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted. No deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. Dibrugarh Municipality and Cantonment. 21. In the municipality 504 and in the cantonment 47 successful vaccinations were done ; the corresponding numbers for 1896-97 were 436 and 19. Forty-eight notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted. Three small-pox deaths were registered in 1897, as against 25 in 1896 and 115 in 1895. Sibsagar Station 22 In Sibsagar, 310 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 403 in 1896-97. Thirteen notices were issued under the Act, 10 persons were prosecuted and 2 were punished. Small- pox, which was epidemic in this place in 1896, continued to prevail throughout 1897, and 16 deaths were registered from this cause. Shillong Station and Cantonment. 23. In the Station 181 and in the cantonment 54 successful vaccinations were done, as against 584 successful cases in the station and 256 in the cantonment in the previous year. No notices were issued under the Act. No small-pox deaths were recorded. Golaghat Union. 24. In Golaghat, 105 successful vaccinations were done, as against 156 in 1896-97. No notices were issued under the Act, and there were no small-pox deaths reported. Jorhat Union. 25. In this union, 119 persons were successfully vaccinated, as compared with 292 in the previous year. No notices were issued under the Act Five deaths from small-pox were registered. Inoculation. 26. Inoculation continues to be frequently practised in the Surma Valley. The Cachar Civil Surgeon reports that it is much practised, but no outbreaks of small-pox were proved to have originated from it. The Civil Surgeon of Sylhet states that inoculation was carried on, to some extent, in all the subdivisions of that district, but that no outbreak of small-
7 pox was proved to have originated directly from the practice. The Lakhimpur Civil Surgeon states that inoculation is still practised among the Assamese in that district. The Inspector of Vaccination, who was sent to Kathalguri to report on an outbreak of small-pox in that mauza, gave reasons for supposing that the outbreak took its rise from persons who had been recently inoculated. The Civil Surgeons of all other districts reported that there was no evidence that inoculation was practised in their districts. Small-pox mortality compared with amount of protection obtained by successful vaccination. 27. In accordance with orders contained in Government of India, Home Depart- ment letter No 49, dated the 8th of February 1894, the following diagram has been prepared in order to compare the death-rate from small-pox registered in 1897, district by district, with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccinations during the seven years 1891-92 to 1897-98. From the diagram it appears that the highest small-pox death-rates in 1897 occurred in the Sibsagar and Lakhimpur districts, in which the greatest protection was given by successful vaccination during the last seven years. The small-pox death-rate in 1897 was lowest in Cachar, in which district, with one exception, the protection afforded by successful vaccination was smallest. As noted in previous reports, the proportion of the inhabitants of Assam successfully vaccinated is comparatively small, means of communication in the interior of districts is difficult, there is often no small-pox in large tracts of the country for a good many years in succession, and, when the disease is afterwards introduced into these tracts, very severe outbreaks take place.

The Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Lymph Depôt at Shillong by the Civil Surgeon of that station is given as Appendix A to this report. The total expenditure for the year, including Rs. 753-14-1 debited to the Manipur State, amounted to Rs. 7,750-15-2, being Rs. 498-2-9 more than Rs. 7,252-12-5, the expenditure incurred during 1896-97. The principal causes of the increased expenditure were (a) the amount paid for capillary tubes was Rs. 394 in excess of the expenditure under that head in 1896-97, and (b) the miscellaneous charges were greater on account of the enhanced rates which prevailed after the earthquake of the 12th of June. There were 101 deaths among protected and unprotected calves, as against 105 in the previous year. During the year, 309,890 tubes were loaded, as compared with 316,923 loaded in 1896-97. On an average 12,310 tubes were sent weekly to Civil Surgeons during the vaccinating season. Civil Surgeons reported that the lymph supplied to them throughout the season was of excellent quality. The Civil Surgeon of Darrang reported that the Shillong lymph took well as if it had an irritant in it. He also stated that. in his opinion it was not so good as humanized lymph, but he did not give the grounds on which he formed that opinion. Much credit is due to Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell for the very efficient manner in which he supervised the depôt during the year and for the activity which he displayed in getting a very useful temporary depôt built to take the place of the old buildings which were demolished by the earthquake. A proposal to construct permanent depôt buildings is under consideration. Dr. Campbell reports that the hospital assistant in subordinate charge, Chandra Nath Chand, and Kamal Charan Datta, who acted for him for two months, performed their duties in an excellent manner. Fresh animal lymph. 29. At the end of the 2nd paragraph of the Resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1896-97, the Chief Commissioner stated that he deemed it advisable that the ordinary supply of lymph should be supplemented, so as to guard against possible accidents at the central depôt, and that further efforts should, therefore, be made to carry out vaccinations with fresh lymph. Civil Surgeons were accordingly requested, in a circular letter dated the 10th of October 1897, to endeavour to carry on vaccinations with fresh calf lymph at the head- quarters of their districts. As in the previous year, the attempt had to be given up on account of the difficulty of obtaining calves and the strong prejudices of the people. Arm-to-arm vaccination. 30. In the Sylhet district, 3,277 vaccinations were done, according to the state- ment of the Civil Surgeon, by the arm-to-arm method, all successfully. Seven successful arm-to-arm vaccinations were done in the Goalpara district. In all other districts all vaccinations were done by preserved lymph obtained from Shillong. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, A. STEPHEN, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
9 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Bovine Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1897-98. Expenditure. 1. The total expenditure for the year 1897-98 was Rs. 6,997-1-1, being Rs. 504-9-3 more than last year. The expenditure incurred by the Manipur State, which is not included in the above, amounted to Rs. 753-14-1, compared with Rs. 760-4-7 in the previous year. The causes of the increase in expenditure this year are given below : (a) The earthquake of June last caused great loss throughout and general disarrangement, which greatly enhanced the price of every article. The daily expenditure on grass, grain and all the little things required in feeding, housing and treating calves was greatly increased relatively to the number of calves vaccinated, owing to the high rates prevailing. (b) The expenditure incurred in purchasing capillary tubes was Rs. 393-9-9 in excess of that of the previous year. It is not out of place to mention that Rs. 360-5-3 was paid for capillary tubes this year, although they were purchased in 1896-97, and a great part of which, 25,000, were used during that year. This amount should have been paid from the grant for 1896-97, and so the expenditure of that year should have been Rs. 6,852-13-1 instead Rs. 6,492-7-10, and the expenditure for 1897-98 would only have been Rs. 6,636-11-10 instead of Rs. 6,997-1-1. The year 1898-99 begins with a balance in hand of 80,000 empty capillary tubes instead of in debt as in 1897-98. (c) The loader having got an increment of Rs. 3 per mensem to his salary this year and one of the servants having received annas 8 more food allowance than in the previous year. (d) Only one calf remained in hand at beginning of 1897-98, compared with 35 calves in 1896-97, the value being Rs 8, as compared with Rs. 280. Petty construction and repairs. 2 The sum of Rs. 136-4-0 was expended on petty construction and repairs. Animals. 3. During the year 415 calves were bought at a net cost of Rs. 2,728, of which Rs. 248 have been charged to Manipur State. The account of calves was as follows : UNPROTECTED CALVES.

The mortality was as follows : Protected calves 72 Unprotected calves ... 29 Total 101 Of the protected calves, 24 died before the lymph was taken and 48 after the lymph had been taken from them. The mortality would probably have been less, had the previous arrangements not been disturbed by the earthquake. Expenditure on calves. 5. The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 2,728, against Rs. 2,608 of the previous year. The work was started this year with only one calf, while there were 35 calves worth Rs. 280 in hand when the work was started in the previous year. This may be attributed as the cause of excess expenditure shown under this head. Feeding chargers. 6. The feeding charges were Rs. 247-11.9 against Rs. 314-10-0 of the previous year. D
10 Miscellancous. 7. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 2,812-9-4, against Rs. 2,513-5-10 of the previous year. Of this amount, cost of capillary tubes was Rs. 2,434-11-6, service postage and telegrams Rs. 79-10-0, and contingencies Rs. 298-3-10. In the year 1896-97, cost of capillary tubes was Rs. 2,041-1-9, service postage and telegrams Rs. 75-13-0, and contingencies Rs. 396-7-1. The excess due to the price of capillary tubes has already been mentioned in paragraph 1 of the report. Establishment. 8. The establishment consists of a second-grade hospital assistant with a special allowance of Rs. 20 a month, a clerk at Rs. 10, a loader at Rs. 15. a coolie at Rs. 9 for the year, and two temporary ccolies at Rs. 9 each for seven months. An additional coolie at Rs. 9 was entertained for six months from Manipur State. Compensation for dearness of grain was given to a coolie, and an increment of Rs. 3 to salary of the loader was given. The cost of establishment was as follows : Rs. a p. Hospital Assistant ... ... ... .'.. 765 0 0 Other establishments ... ... . . 555 8 0 Manipur coolie .. ... .. ... ... ... 54 0 0 Inoculation. 9. Three hundred and sixty-nine calves were inoculated, of which, one operation failed, 24 died before lymph had been taken, and from 6 lymph was not taken either on account of illness or because the vesicles were not quite up to the mark. Number of tubes loaded. 10. The total number of tubes loaded was 309,890, and the average number obtained from each calf was 916.83. In the previous year the total number of tubes loaded was 316,923, and average number obtained from each calf was 895.26. Distribution of lymph. 11. Lymph was distributed regularly to all the Civil Surgeons in the province, including Manipur and North Lushai Hills, and to Dr. Macnamara, Badlipur, Sibsagar, and occasionally to medical officers and managers of the tea gardens, Medical Officer of 42nd Gurkha Rifles, and to the missionaries on their requisitions.

14 A.15 A.16 B.17 Comparative Statement No. IV.18 Statement No. V.ASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING OFFICE (GENERAL) No. 91Resolution on the Vaccination Report of Assam for 1897-98. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 4952G., dated Shillong, the 23rd June 1898. Read2 primary vaccinations in that district, and that, while the work was on the whole excellent, he found that several of the vaccinations had been unsuccessful. There is evidently need for closer scrutiny of vaccination results on the part of Civil Surgeons. Out of the total number of operations inspected by these officers during the year, 98.66 per cent. were found successful, but there is reason to believe that in many instances the results of these inspections were misleading, only successful cases having been brought before the Civil Surgeons for examination. The Sanitary Commissioner has now issued instructions to Inspecting officers, which, it is hoped, will result in the vaccina- tors' work being more effectively tested in future. At the same time the result of Dr. Stephen's own inspections leaves no doubt as to the generally satisfactory character of the work, or as to the efficacy of the lymph supplied from the Shillong depôt. It is to be regretted that the attempts to carry out vaccination with fresh lymph have again failed. Mr. Cotton cannot accept as sufficient the explanations offered for this failure, namely, the difficulty of obtaining calves, and the prejudices of the people, and he believes that these difficulties may be overcome as they have been elsewhere by the exercise of tact and perseverance. Arm-to-arm vaccination was carried out in 3,277 cases in Sylhet, and in 7 cases in Goalpara, and is reported to have been successful in all the cases. 4. The proportion of the population successfully vaccinated during the year was 4.67 per cent., against 4.57 per cent. in 1896-97. The number of infants under one year of age successfully vaccinated shows a satisfactory increase from 45,865 to 58,455. During the calendar year 1897, 163,617 births were registered in Assam, and in the Census Report of 1891, the number of children under one year of age was stated to be 191,720. The proportion of infants successfully vaccinated was thus 35.72 per cent. of the registered birth-rate, and 30.49 per cent. of the estimated number of infants available for vaccination. 5. The Compulsory Vaccination Act was brought into force in the Nowgong Munici- pality on the 7th April 1897. Notwithstanding this increase in the areas in which vaccination is compulsory, there was a decrease in the number of vaccinitions in such areas from 4,152 to 3,487, a result which is unsatisfactory and is not explained. It is possibly due to the difficulty which was felt, after the earthquake, in municipalities more than anywhere else, of carrying on regular work in all departments. It is observed that only 365 persons were successfully vaccinated in the Sylhet Municipa- lity, as against 559 in 1896-97, and that, although 470 notices were issued, not a single prosecution was instituted. The Chief Commissioner desires that the penal provisions of the Act should be discreetly and moderately, rather than strictly, administered, but he finds that in the Sylhet Municipality, in the face of a very imperfect system of vaccination, there have been no prosecutions since 1892, and the inference is irresistible that the provisions of the law have been applied with undue leniency. 'The Deputy Commissioner must carefully avoid indiscriminate prosecutions, which are only calculated to excite public opinion against vaccination, but when there is so much undoubted neglect in the matter, the law must not be allowed to remain a dead letter. These remarks are applicable to most of the towns in the province where the law is in force, and especially to Dhubri, Golaghat, and Jorhat. 6. The number of recorded deaths from small-pox in the eleven towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Acts were in force was 29, or 0.41 per 1,000, as compared with a death-rate of 89 per 1,000 in the ten towns in which vaccination was compulsory in 1896. The corresponding figures for the province as a whole were 1.08 and 1.09 per 1,000, respectively. As in the preceding year, the highest death-rate occurred in the Lakhimpur district, where the proportion of persons protected by vaccination is largest, but in view of the small number of persons protected by successful vaccination in the province, no relation can be established between the small-pox death-rate and the amount of protection afforded in each district.

No. 700S. FROM COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 26th May 1899. SIR, Late submission of returns. I HAVE the honor to submit the prescribed Vaccination Statements for the year 1898-99, with certain remarks. This report was due to you on May 15th, but as the last statement required was not received from the Sibsagar district until May 13th, instead of reaching me, as it should have done, on April 15th, the delay has been unavoidable. The returns from seven other districts were received after May 1st. Number of vaccinators employed. 2. Annual Statement No. I shows the average number of vaccinators employed in each district, as well as details of work done by paid and licensed vaccinators. The vaccinating staff was practically of the same strength and constitution as in 1897-98, con- sisting of 18 inspectors, 183 paid and 29 licensed vaccinators with 7 apprentices, a total of 237 individuals ; against 18 inspectors, 182 paid and 30 licensed vaccinators with 10 apprentices, or a total of 240 individuals, in the previous year. No changes of importance were made in the distribution of this staff, except that 3 paid vaccina- tors were appointed to the Lushai Hills for the first time. Amount of work done by paid and licensed vaccinators. 3. During the working season 1898-99, 127,075 males and 105,344 females, or a total of 232,419 persons were vaccinated by the paid and licensed staff, against 255,583 in 1897-98 ; that is, there was a falling off of no less than 23,164. Of these 232,419 operations, 210,986 were primary vaccinations, 21,433 were re-vaccinations, against 245,381 primary and 10,202 secondary ones in 1897-98. The number of re-vaccina- tions is thus shown to be more than double of what were done in the previous year ; but the number of primary operations, which are the more important, fell from 245,381 to 210,986, a very serious decrease indeed. Of those successfully vaccinated, 47,317 were infants under one year of age, as against 55,574 in 1897-98, and 44,472 in 1896- 97. Percentage of operations report- ed as successful. 4. The paid and licensed vaccinators reported that out of their 210,986 primary operations, 208,542, or a percentage of 98.84, were suc- cessful ; and that out of their 21,433 re-vaccinations, 20,113, or a percentage of 93.84, were successful. I personally inspected a very large number of cases during my tours, especially in the Nowgong district, and I am of opinion that the number of cases reported as successful is too high. Vaccinators seem to report, as successful, cases in which the smallest vesicle follows the operation, notwithstanding that no trace may be visible three months after- wards. From my personal inspections I should think the primary operations were prob- ably satisfactory in 95 per cent., partially successful in 3 per cent., and failures in about 2 per cent. The percentage reported of successful re-vaccinations, viz., 93.84, is suspiciously high, and is to my mind inconsistent with a very high percentage of thoroughly successful primary vaccinations; at the same time I would add that the lymph supplied by the Vaccine Depôt in Shillong is so good and uniform in quality that the percentage of successful cases in the hands of a skilful operator might approach the possible. It is known that Lieutenant-Colonel R. Neil Campbell has done over 800 operations with his own hands, without a single failure ; but we cannot expect the whole of the vaccinating staff to be equally expert. B
2 Percentage of population pro- tected. 5. Eleven thousand four hundred and five successful vaccinations were done by tea-garden agencies, all primary ones ; and 13,226 primary and 348 secondary ones were performed by the dispensary establishments; including all these a grand total is reached of 253,634 successful operations; this shows that during the last working season 45.02 per 1,000 of the population were protected, as compared with 49.62 in 1897-98. The past quinquennial average is 40.62 ; but in previous reports the number of vaccinations done by the dispensary establishments has for some reason or other not been taken into account, and hence in the report for 1897, this average was shown as 34.12; but it was in reality considerably higher. Cost of the Vaccine Department. 6. Annual Statement No. II shows the cost of the Vaccine Department to have been Rs. 22,197, against Rs. 22,345 in the previous year3 Work done in each district by all agencies combined. 9. The next Table No. 2 gives the number of vaccination operations done by all agencies combined in the different districts for the last five working seasons, and it shows a most undesirable fall- ing off in the amount of work done in the last one: Table No. 2. Showing the amount of vaccination work done by all agencies in each district during the past five years. District.

With the exception of Cachar and Lakhimpur where just about the usual average of work has been done, the only plains district which shows any increase is Kamrup where 32,000 opera- tions are reported to have been done, against 24,091 in 1897-98 and 25,520 in 1896-97, but as the number of births registered in this district was only 16,142 in 1897 and 16,201 in 1898, that is, 32,343 in the two years, I doubt very much whether 32,000 vaccinations were really performed ; I should like to believe they were. In the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the number has been nearly doubled, being 8,412 against 4,397. In the Garo Hills also the number is nearly doubled, viz., 15,866 against 8,798. So also in the Lushai Hills, and in the Manipur State the number has risen from 19,139 to 21,962. Districts showing decreased work. 11. The Darrang, Goalpara, Sylhet, Sibsagar and Nowgong districts show a great decrease in the number of operations performed, so also do the Naga Hills, and the extent of the decrease in some of these districts, notably Sibsagar and Nowgong, is a matter for grave anxiety. Naga Hills. 12. The number of vaccinations fell from an average of about 10,800 to 7,677, but the cause of the decrease here is readily explicable ; there had been a bad epidemic of small-pox in 1894 and 1895, and the people got thoroughly frightened, and as a former Deputy Commissioner of the district informs me, whole villages were vaccinated at one time; the number therefore reported in 18054 teen thousand, the performance of nearly twenty thousand vaccinations would be very satisfactory. I am inclined to attribute the decrease in 1898 to the great interest taken by Mr. Ward, the late District Superintendent of Police, in all hygienic measures, and I think he managed by his personal efforts and influence to get work done in 1897 at a higher level than can be kept up, now that he has left the district on furlough. Sylhet. 15. This large and important district suffered so severely from a fearful outbreak of malarial fever in 1897, that the general stamina of the whole population was seriously lowered, the mortality was very high, especially of children, the birth-rate decreased from 35.17 to 30.46 per mille, and the natural consequence is that there were fewer children to be vaccinated in 1898-99. The decrease was large, viz., from 87,004 to 72,292, but I think the explana- tion given above is the correct one, and I cannot attribute blame to any one. Sibsagar. 1894-95... 21,889 1895-96... 33,312 1896-97... 41,283 1897-38... 33,024 1898-99... 20,380 16. For the sake of easy reference the number of vaccina- tions done in this district during the last five working seasons is given in the margin. Major Fink, the district Civil Surgeon, reports as follows : There were 20,380 cases operated on during the current year, against 33,024 in the previous year. This number, though smaller than in the previous year, is somewhat explainable by the fact that recent epidemics of small-pox in previous years have caused a fairly large mortality among the unprotected, whilst those who have survived bear distinct marks of pitting. In another place he reports that 5 my predecessor for his bad and short work : he has retaliated by not doing one single vaccination this year, and as he has left the province without orders and is at the present moment absent without leave, I have separately recommended his dismissal from the service. I visited this district in January last especially to enquire into vaccination matters and was quite satisfied with the quality of the work done, though I could not then judge of the amount. The tahsildar of Roha, Pandit Guna Hash Goswami, has taken a great interest in spreading vaccination in his ilaka, and if all other civil officials had done the same, I feel sure that in spite of the short season and lessened birth-rate, we should have had an increase, and not a decrease in the number of people protected from small-pox, and I would beg to recommend that the thanks of the Honorable the Chief Commissioner be conveyed to this gentlemen who is the head of a large religious community, and whose teaching and example have been most beneficial. Number of primary vaccinations. Season. Number of operations. 1894-95... 195,703 1895-96... 253,641 1896-97... 267,198 1897-98... 272,713 l898-99... 237,232 19. Annual Statement No. IV gives details of the total number of primary vaccina- tions and the number of successful operations for the last ten years, and shows that the number done in 1898-99 is less than that done in any year since 1894-95, and presents a regretable break in a line of satisfactory progress; the extract given in the margin exhibits this clearly. Verification of vaccinations by Inspecting Officers. 20. Annual Statement No. V shows the particulars of verification of vaccination work. Excluding 12,215 vaccinations done by tea-garden agencies, 246,690 persons were vaccinated during the past season; of these, 22,577 were inspected by Civil Surgeons and 133,681 by the Inspectors of Vaccination, against 24,207 and 150,005 so inspected last year. The percentage of operations found to be successful by Civil Surgeons was 95.99, against 98.66 in the previous year ; the Native Inspectors report a percentage of 98.73 successful operations, as against 98.14 last season ; and the vaccinators themselves report 98.84 of their primary operations to have been successful. As above stated (see paragraph 4), I consider the Civil Surgeons' figures to be the most reliable. This year Assistant Surgeon Bancroft, Civil Medical Officer, Garo Hills, has inspected the greatest number, viz., 5,460, and he also raised the number of operations from 8,798 to 15,866. This is extremely creditable to him, and I think he thoroughly well deserves the special thanks of the Honorable the Chief Commissioner. Verification of licensed vaccina- tors' work. 21. Table No. 3 shows similar particulars of verification of the work done by the licensed vaccinators as apart from other agencies. The percentage found to be successful by the Civil Surgeons is reported as one hundred per cent., that is, that no one case failed. This shows that only successful cases have been brought before them, and the procedure laid down in paragraph 12 of my predecessor's report for 1897-98 has evidently not been acted on. The special attention of all Civil Medical Officers has been again directed to this important point : TABLE No. 3.

6 Vaccination in places where Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force. 22. In Table No. 4 the details of vaccination work done in places where the Compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force are given. These places are the Silchar, Sylhet, Dhubri, Goalpara, Gauhati, Nowgong and Dibrugarh Municipalities, the Sibsagar and Shillong Stations and the Golaghat and Jorhat Unions. The population of these 11 places, including the cantonments at Dibrugarh and Shillong, is 71,128. Amongst these, 3,021 vaccinations only were performed, as against 3,487 in the previous season, but in spite of this, the number of deaths from small-pox was only 25, against 29 in 1897; the death-rate from this cause, viz., 0.35 per mille, is less than that (0.41) of last year, and compares very favorably with the general provincial rate (1.03), and affords good reasons for extension of the Acts to other towns. In the last season 553 notices were issued under the Acts, 26 persons were prosecuted and 4 punished; the figures show that the Acts are being more steadily enforced ; in 1896-97, 618 notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted; in 1897-98, 594 notices were issued, 25 persons were prosecuted and 2 punished : TABLE No. 4.

In this municipality 372 successful vaccinations were performed, as against 365 in 1897-98. Although 378 notices were issued, yet not a single prosecution was instituted. As in the last year, two deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. Dhubri Municipality. 25. Only 34 operations were done successfully in Dhubri during the year, while 105 successful ones were performed in the preceding year. No notices were issued under the Act. Three deaths resulted from small-pox during the year. This is not satisfactory, and greater attention should be given to vaccination next year. Goalpara Municipality. 26. Fifty-nine successful vaccinations were done in this municipality, as against 98 in the previous year. Eighty-four notices were issued, but only 3 persons were punished. There were no small- pox deaths reported. Gauhati Municipality. 27. In this municipality 392 successful vaccinations were performed during the year, which is a little over half of the operations, viz., 722, performed in 1897-98. There were 10 deaths from small- pox, and no notices issued under the Act. The work here has also been unsatisfactory, and greater care and trouble should be taken next year. Nowgong Municipality. 28. In Nowgong 141 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 553 in the preceding year. Only one notice was issued, and no one was prosecuted. Five deaths from small-pox were regis- tered. Vaccination work in the whole of this district has greatly fallen off. See remarks in paragraph 18. Dibrugarh Municipality and Cantonment. 29. In the municipality 608 and in the cantonment 104 successful vaccinations were done ; the corresponding numbers for 1897-98 were 504 and 47. Sixty-eight notices were issued, but no one was prosecuted. No small-pox deaths were registered. Sibsagar Station. 30. In Sibsagar 316 persons were successfully vaccinated, as against 310 in 1897- 98. It appears that only 8 notices were issued under the Act, but 22 persons were prosecuted, though no one was punished. Five deaths from small-pox were registered during the year. The notices were here probably collective and not individual ones, though I do not find it so stated, in the district returns. Shillong Station and Cantonment. 31. In the civil station 235 and in the cantonment 157 operations were performed successfully during the year, as against 181 and 54, re- spectively, in the previous season. No notices were issued under the Act, and no small-pox deaths were recorded. Practically the whole popula- tion is protected. Golaghat Union. 32. In this union only 76 successful vaccinations were done, as against 105 in the preceding year. One person was prosecuted and punished under the Act. No death from small-pox was recorded. Jorhat Union. 33. One hundred and forty-seven persons were successfully vaccinated, as com- pared with 119 in the previous year. No notices were issued under the Act, and there were no small-pox deaths reported. Inoculation. 34. The Civil Surgeon of Dhubri states that not a single case of inoculation has been reported for many years past, although the people have not taken kindly to vaccination. The Civil Surgeons of Kamrup, Darrang, Nowgong and Lakhimpur state that the practice of inoculation has almost entirely ceased in their districts, but the Civil Surgeon, Sibsagar, thinks it is still resorted to in some of his villages. In the Surma Valley the practice still survives, but not to the same extent as formerly; no epidemic of small-pox could be traced to this custom.
8 Arm-to-arm vaccination. 35. The practice of arm-to-arm vaccination has been practically abandoned through- out the whole province; none of the Civil Surgeons report that any such operations have been performed, I have not myself heard of any, and as long as an almost unlimited supply of most excellent calf lymph can be got from the Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, I do not suppose it will ever again be reverted to. Death-rate from small-pox. 36. The annexed diagram shows the death-rate from small-pox recorded in 1898, as compared with the amount of protection afforded by successful vaccination during the seven years 1892-93 to 1898-99; and has been prepared in accordance with the orders contained in Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 49, dated the 8th February 1894. About one quarter of the population of Assam are protected against small-pox by vaccination, but as in many neighbourhoods the people will not allow their children to be vaccinated, in spite of the most earnest persuasion, every now and then small- pox breaks out, and great loss of life occurs, as happened last year in the Nowgong district. Report on Bovine Vaccine Lymph Depôt. 37. Lieutenant-Colonel R. Neil Campbell's Annual Report on the Bovine Vaccine Lymph Depôt at Shillong is printed in extenso as Appendix A to this report. The work done during the past season has been considerably in excess of that done in any previous one, and the request of the Superintendent for an increased establishment is so evidently well founded that I have directed him to come up officially for sanction. Excluding expenditure by the Manipur State which amounted to Rs. 762-14-0, the total cost of the depôt was Rs. 7,730-5-5, being Rs. 733-4-4 more than last year; this increase was caused by more capillary tubes being required, and more calves having been purchased and fed. The present arrangement for the supply of calves seems to be satisfactory and is certainly the best available. A contractor supplies them at Rs. 7 per head ; he stands all risks of deaths en route and before and after inoculation, and he takes the protected calves away when they are no longer required. An attempt was made during the year to start additional depôts at other stations to minimise the chance of suitable lymph not being always available at Shillong owing to any outbreak of cattle-disease, but the expense was found to be prohibitive. No less than 348,967 tubes were loaded and sent out, but as only 258,905 vaccinations were performed in the whole year, it is evident that the vaccinators waste the tubes; this is known to be the case in some instances, and the Civil Surgeons have been asked to give their attention to the number of tubes supplied to each vaccinator and the number of operations he reports as having been performed. 38. Regarding the method of preparing lymph for transmission to the operators, I reproduce as Appendix B some remarks which I had the honor of addressing to you in November last, as they may possibly be of use to others interested in the question. Mortality amongst the calves. 39. The mortality amongst the calves used has been decreased, viz., from 101 to 34, owing to better food and more bedding having been given, and a higher price paid for them, which, owing to the fact that the contractor gets all that recover back free to sell for agricultural work, induces him to bring up a much better class of animal. But I would beg to add respectfully, with reference to paragraph 4 of Government of India letter No. 641, dated the 16th February 1899, that the remark of the Army Sanitary Commission that excessive mortality amongst the calves might increase the caste prejudices of the vaccinators, is founded on a misunderstanding. We have no difficulties of caste prejudices of vaccinators to contend with at all, some of them are Hindus, some Khasis, some Assamese, and others Muhammadans; but none have the least chance of knowing what the mortality amongst the calves is, whether large or small, until the Annual Depôt Report is published, and I do not suppose that even one amongst the whole lot ever has a single paragraph of it read to him. Given a sufficient establishment to feed the animals and load the tubes, a far greater quantity of lymph up, to our usual standard could be produced. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., Colonel, Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] NOTE.11 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Animal Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1898-99. Expenditure. The total expenditure for the year 1898-99 was Rs. 7,730-5-5, being Rs. 733-4-4 more than last year. The expenditure incurred by the Manipur State, which is not included in the above, amounted to Rs. 762-14-0, compared with Rs. 753-14-1 in the previous year. The causes of the increase in expenditure this year are given below: (a) More calves had to be purchased, as the supply of tubes required was much greater than in any previous year. (b) An increase in feeding charges, as there were more calves, and a more liberal supply of cut grass was provided. Petty construction and repairs. 2. The sum of Rs. 124-8-9 was expended on petty construction and repairs. Animals. 3. During the year 501 calves were bought at a net cost of Rs. 3,507, of which Rs. 280 have been charged to Manipur State. The account of calves was as follows: UNPROTECTED CALVES. Balance in hand on 1st April 1898... ... ... ... ... 13 Bought during the year... ... 501 Total... 519 Vaccinated... 390 Died... 11 Balance in hand on 1st April 1899... ... ... 118 PROTECTED CALVES.

The total number of calves died during the against 101 in previous year. The mortality was as follows: year was 34 as follows: Protected calves... ... ... ... ... 23 Unprotected calves... ... ... ... ... 11 Total... ... ... 34 Of the protected calves, 13 died before the lymph was taken, and 10 after the lymph had been taken from them. The decrease in mortality may be ascribed to several causes: (a) A new contract has been entered into by which the contractor receives all the calves back after inoculation without payment, it is therefore to his advantage to give good, strong and healthy calves. (b) He takes delivery now of the calves twice a week, so that there is no overcrowding. (c) A greater supply of straw bedding was provided, so that colds were not so prevalent. D
12 Expenditure on calves. 5. The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 3,507, against Rs. 2,728 of the previous year. The increase is due to the fact that 21 more calves were inoculat- ed than in the previous year, and that there are 118 calves still remaining. Owing to a diminished mortality and a better average number of tubes loaded from each calf, so many calves were not required as were expected, hence the large number in hand. These will be available for the ensuing year. Feeding charges. 6. Feeding charges were Rs. 283-7-6, against Rs. 247-11-9 of the previous year. Miscellaneous. 7. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 2,781-5-2, against Rs. 2,812-9-4 of the previous year. The decrease is due to a smaller expenditure on tubes. There was a large balance of empty tubes in hand at the beginning of the year. Establishment. 8. The establishment consists of a second-grade Hospital Assistant with a special allowance of Rs. 20 a month, a clerk at Rs. 10, a loader at Rs. 15, a coolie at Rs. 9 for the year, and two temporary coolies at Rs. 9 each for seven months, and an additional coolie at Rs. 9 was entertained for seven months from Manipur State. Compensation for dearness of grain was given to a coolie. The cost of establishment was as follows : Rs Hospital Assistant... ... ... ... ... ... ... 765 Other establishments... ... ... ... ... 549 Manipur coolie... ... 63 Practically there has been no change in the numbers of the establishment since the depôt was started in 1890, with the exception that Manipur State has paid the wages of a coolie for seven months each year since 1891-92. The work has increased very much in the last three years, and it has been found impossible to carry out the duties without making further temporary arrangements. Sometimes as many as 4,000 to 5,000 tubes have to be loaded in a single day which keeps the loader working from morning till 10 p.m., even though he gets assistance from one of the coolies who has been taught to load. It is absolutely necessary to have two loaders. An extra coolie is also required to tend the calves. The cost of this increase in establishment will be13 The total number of tubes of lymph supplied yearly since the depôt was started is as follows : Years.

Throughout the year the lymph has been excellent. The Agency Surgeon, Jhallawar and Kotah, reports that the lymph forwarded to him was successful in every case. Dr. Elliot, Noakachari, says &quot; the lymph has been of excellent quality all round.&quot; Dr. Johns, Chandkhira, Sylhet, says &quot; the cases done from the former two boxes I got from you have been very successful.&quot; Remarks on hospital assistant. 13. Hospital Assistant Chandra Nath Chand was in charge from the beginning of the year to the middle of October and worked zealously. Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta was in charge from the middle of October to the end of March, i.e., during almost the whole of the working season, and deserves great credit for the excellence of his work. General. 14. The work is still carried on in temporary buildings erected after the earthquake. During the non-working season of 1899-1900 the new dep6t will be finished it is hoped. The work has already been com- menced. The same contract for calves as was given last year has been given for next year. It has been found a very satisfactory contract. R. N. CAMPBELL, M. B., Lieut.-Colonel, Civil Surgeon, Shillong.
14 Statement of net Expenditure incurred on the Animal Vaccine Depôt at Shillong during the year 1898-99. 15 APPENDIX B. Extract from remarks by Colonel C. W. Carr-Calthrop on the preservation of Bovine Vaccine Lymph. (a) Bovine vaccine lymph can be used fresh only where there is an establishment in which the calves can be inoculated and children vaccinated on the premises direct from the calf. To take calves sick from the vaccine fever about from place to place, would cause a very serious mortality amongst them and would in my opinion be very likely to cause a &quot; scare&quot; in the place where the vaccinators were about to work, and I think in many places the temper and prejudices of the people would never allow the operations to be done. (b) The preservation of the lymph is therefore necessary: this can be done in two ways, namely, by admixture with lanoline or by solution in a mixture of glycerine and water. There may possibly be other means of preserving it, but we are only concerned with these two methods. (c) The first is easy, rapid and cheap, but it is open to various objections ; and is used in the Shillong depôt, only for the preparation of virus intended to be used in the depôt itself for inoculating calves: the small pots in which the mixture is kept are emptied at one time, each calf having a separate pot, and these pots are not allowed to be opened, part of the contents used and the rest kept for a future occasion. This is to avoid risks of contamination. (d) If lanoline lymph were supplied to district vaccinators, they would have to carry their opened pots about with them, setting them down on the ground, in the sunshine, in the dust, any- where, putting in a dirty or bloody lancet from time to time, and, in fact, exposing the virus to various chances of deterioration. (e) For district use therefore the second form of preservation is solely used. The vaccine matter as scraped from the abdomens of the vaccinifers is pounded up with a mixture of glycerine and water in the proportion of 2 parts of the solid matter, and 1 part each of glycerine and water, by weight. This forms a slightly viscous solution or rather emulsion, which is just sufficiently limpid to flow up into capillary tubes, which are then hermetically sealed by fusing their ends in the flame of a spirit lamp. (f) The advantages of this plan are many and obvious: there is no possibility of foreign matter getting mixed with the virus, it cannot be contaminated by a part being laid on the arm of a child and a portion of this then put back into the mass; each child receives the contents of one tube: the virus is kept hermetically sealed and the atmosphere can have no effect on it. (g) The defects of the plan are that it is troublesome, laborious and more expensive than simple admixture with lanoline, but its many manifest advantages compensate for this many times over. (h) The admixture of glycerine and water in the proportion given above does not at all interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine germs, and it is certain that they will keep their potency for three or four months, which is more than we require.

STATEMENTS.
18 A.19 A.20 B.21 Comparative Statement No. IV.22 Statement No. V.ASSAM SECRETARIAT PRINTING OFFICE (GENERAL) NO. 112Resolution on the Vaccination Report of Assam for 1898-99. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 4720G., dated Shillong, the 22nd June 1899. Read2 with a very high percentage of thoroughly successful primary vaccinations; at the same time I would add that the lymph supplied by the vaccine depôt in Shillong is so good and uniform in quality that the percentage of successful cases in the hands of a skilful operator might approach the possible. It is known that Lieutenant-Colonel R. Neil Campbell has done over 800 operations with his own hands, without a single failure ; but we cannot expect the whole of the vaccinating staff to be equally expert. The Chief Commissioner is disappointed to find that there has again been, a falling off in inspection work done by Civil Surgeons and Inspectors of Vaccination. The decrease in the number of operations verified by the Civil Surgeons of Goal- para, Nowgong, and Darrang is most marked. Mr. Cotton notes that excellent work has been done in connection with vaccination by Military Assistant Surgeon Bancroft,. Civil Medical Officer of the Garo Hills district, who inspected the largest number of operations, 5,460, and whose exertions have resulted in increasing the total number of vaccinations in that district from 8,798 to 15,866. Of the cases inspected by the Civil Surgeons, 95.99 per cent. were found to be successful, against 98.66 per cent. in the preceding year, but of the operations of licensed vaccinators inspected in the districts of Goalpara, Kamrup, and Sibsagar, 100 per cent. were found successful, showing that only successful cases were produced before the Civil Surgeons, and that sufficient care is not yet exercised in testing the vaccinators' work. 3. The annual report of the animal vaccine depôt at Shillong is appended to the Vaccination Report. The Chief Commissioner has visited the depôt, Where work is being carried on in temporary and very inadequate sheds since the earthquake, on several occasions. The arrangements made there, considering the present difficulties, are most satisfactory, and the large outturn of loaded capillary tubes remarkable. The highest testimony is borne to the excellence of the lymph which is preserved in a solution of glycerine and water, and having regard to the trend of opinion on the subject, which is altogether in favour of using this lymph, Mr. Cotton has authorised the abandonment of all further attempts to introduce vaccination with fresh calf lymph at the headquarters of district. The establishment of local depôts would, moreover, involve expense which the Administration cannot at present afford. The new depôt at Shillong is now under construction. The Chief Commissioner is glad to take this opportunity of again acknowledging the valuable services rendered by Lieutenant-Colonel Neil Campbell in supervising the work of this institution. Arm-to-arm vaccination has now been practically abandoned throughout the province, and no operations of this class were reported during the year. 4. The proportion of the population successfully vaccinated was 4.50 per cent., against 4.67 per cent. in 1897-98. The number of infants under one year of age successfully vaccinated was 50,389, against 58,455. During the calendar year 1898, 147,889 births were registered in Assam, and in the Census Report of 1891 the number of children under one year of age was stated to be 191,720. The proportion of infants successfully vaccinated was thus 34.07 per cent. of the registered birth-rate and only 26.28 per cent. of the estimated number of infants available for vaccination. 5. The Compulsory Vaccination Acts remained in force in the same eleven towns, as in the preceding year. The number of vaccinations in these areas was 3,021 only, as compared with 3,487 in the preceding year and 4,152 in 1896-97. In his Resolution on last year's report, the Chief Commissioner commented upon the decrease in vaccin- ation in compulsory areas, which had not been satisfactorily explained, but again no explanation is offered of the further decline which has occurred in 1898-99. In the Resolution referred to, it was pointed out that in the Sylhet Municipality, in the face of a very imperfect system of vaccination, there had been no prosecutions under the Act since 1892, though a large number of notices had been issued to defaulters, which showed that the provisions of the law had been applied with undue leniency. The number of vaccinations in the Sylhet Municipality in 1898-99, while showing a slight improvement over the figure of 1897-98, was much less than in 1895-96 or in 1896-97 ; yet there was no prosecution under the Act, though 378 notices were issüed. In the Municipalities of Dhubri and Gauhati, though the number of vaccinations fell off seriously, there was no prosecution during the year. It is evident that, in the munici- palities referred to, the Chief Commissioner's orders on this subject have had little or no effect, and the special attention of the Deputy Commissioners concerned is drawn to the necessity of a judicious exercise of the coercive provisions of the law.While Mr. Cotton is anxious to avoid undue severity in the administration of the Act, he cannot permit it to fall into desuetude in those areas to which it has been extended on good and sufficient grounds for the protection of the public health.
3 6. The number of recorded deaths from small-pox in the eleven towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Acts were in force was 25, or 0.35 per 1,000, as compared with 0.41 per 1,000 in 1897. The corresponding figures for the province, as a whole, were 1.03 and 1.08 per 1,000, respectively. The greatest mortality from small-pox occurred in the Nowgong district,ANNUAL VACCINATION REPORT OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. BY COLONEL C. W.

No. 2340. FROM COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 4th June 1900. SIR, Late submission of returns. I HAVE the honor to submit the prescribed Vaccination Statements for the year 1899-1900, with short notes only, that year being an intermediate one of a triad. The statements should have reached you by May 15th, but the last return required to complete the compilation only reached me on May 29th from Nowgong. The district returns were due to me on April 15th, but in six cases they did not reach me until after May 1st. Number of vaccinators employ- ed. 2. Annual Statement No. I shows the number of vaccinators employed and the work they did. The staff was practically the same as in former years. Amount of work done by paid and licensed vaccinators. 3. Excluding the work done on tea gardens and at dispensaries, where the sex of the children is not reported, 137,295 males and 98,736 females were vaccinated during the year. Including the work on tea gardens and dispensaries, the total number of 272,265 vaccine operations were performed, against a total of 258,905 last year and a quinquennial average of 245,602. This shows that the decrease which occurred in 1898-99 has been much more than stopped, and satisfactory progress has been made; and I think I may fairly say that this has been more than a little due to the re-iterated calls of attention to vaccine work, which have been issued from this office, and the consequent increased attention the District Medical Officers have given to this section of their multifarious duties. Percentage of operations report- ed as successful. 4. Out of the 272,265 vaccine operations, 255,131 were primary and 17,134 were re-vaccinations. Of the 255,131 primary operations, 61,793 were performed on children under one year old, against 50,389 last year ; and 121,415 on children between 1 year and 6 years, against 125,645 in the preceding year. The percentage of successful primary operations works out to 98.50 and of re-vaccinations to 88.90 ; the lymph sup- plied from the Shillong depôt is of such exceedingly good quality that I am no longer inclined to doubt the high average of successful primary operations; for Captain Leventon has lately done 272 cases himself with only two failures, and in each of these two a second operation the next week was completely successful. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations has fallen from 93.78 to 88.90. This is only natural. As the primary work becomes more and more thorough, re-vaccinations will tend to show a smaller percentage of success. Number of punctures to be made in vaccine operations. 5. The lymph, as we make it, is so strong and causes in some cases so much in- flammation, that I issued a circular for the instruction of all concerned that punctures were only to be made on one arm in three places when the children were fine and strong, and in two only when small or delicate. This has without doubt had a beneficial result on the amount of work done, as mothers do not object so much when only one arm is operated on. Percentage of population pro- tected. 6. Eleven thousand five hundred and nineteen primary vaccinations were performed by tea-garden agencies, and 10,963, or a percentage of 95.22, were reported as successful. The dispensary establishment did 23,075 primary operations, and reported 22,420, or a B
2 percentage of 97.16, as successful. The proportion of the population protected by these 272,265 vaccine operations comes to 46.62 per thousand, against 45.02 in 1898-99. Cost of the Vaccine Department. 7. Annual Statement No. II shows the cost of the department to have been Rs. 22,938-6-3, a small increase over the figures of last year, caused by the licensed vaccinators in the Kamrup district having been replaced by paid men. Rupees 18,575 was spent on salaries, Rs. 3,018 on travelling allowances, and Rs. 1,345 on contingencies. The Provincial Funds provided Rs. 8,825, against Rs. 8,923 in 1898-99 ; Local Funds gave Rs. 11,815, as against Rs. 11,178; Municipalities gave Rs. 872, against Rs. 910; and the Manipur State paid Rs. 1,426, against Rs. 1,185 in the preceding year. Work done by the dispensary establishment. 8. Annual Statement No. III shows the details of the vaccination work done by the dispensary establishments.

Work done in each district by all agencies combined. 10. The next table (No. 2) shows the amount of vaccination work done in each district for the last five years. A great increase took place in the Sylhet district, owing no doubt to the improved general health and the greater number of children born, and a very large increase was made in the Garo Hills. The work in Manipur fell off a little, and in the Kamrup district the number of operations performed fell to about the level of 1896-97 and 1897-98, the progress of 1898-99 not having been maintained. The Civil Surgeon reports that this is due to the change of system, the licensed vaccinators having been replaced by paid men ; and I hope that next year I may have
3 to congratulate this district on larger results. In the Garo Hills the spread of vaccina- tion is almost phenomenal, the number of operations having been4 Number of inspections by Native Inspectors. 1897-98 ... ... 150,005 1898-99 ... ... 133,681 1899-1900... ... 121,660 increased the number of their inspections, but the work of the inspectors, specially paid as such, has not been satis- factory, and unless more and better work is done next year, I shall propose to punish these men, and remove the most inefficient. The Civil Medical Officer of the Garo Hills, Military Assistant Surgeon Bancroft, has kept up his reputation. He has again nearly doubled the number of operations done in his district, and he has himself inspected no less than 12,116 children, i.e., very nearly as much as was done in the whole of the other 12 districts put together. This officer's work has been very valuable, and I have again the pleasure to suggest that he should be accorded the special thanks of the Honorable the Chief Commissioner. Verification of licensed vaccina- tors' work. 14. Table 3 shows the result of the verification of work done by licensed vaccina- tors only : the proportion of successes is shown to be 97.91. Apparently the remarks I made on this point last year have borne fruit. TABLE No. 3.

The population of these 11 places, including the cantonments of Dibrugarh and Shillong, is 71,128.

Campbell's Annual Report on the Bovine Vaccine Lymph Depôt is printed in full as Appendix A. Three hundred and thirty calves were inoculated and 317,382 tubes were loaded with the lymph they furnished. The total expense was Rs. 7,753-7-1. The establishment is too small for the enormous amount of work that has to be got through, and I beg to support Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell's request for an increase, and have submitted a formal proposition statement separately. I have also recommended that a local allowance of Rs. 100 monthly should be given to the Civil Surgeon to compensate for the continual hard work which the close superintendence necessary, entails. 32. I reprint as Appendix B the notes on the preservation of Bovine Vaccine lymph, which I had the honor of addressing to you in November 1898, as a certain amount of controversy is going on, regarding the preservation of lymph in glycerine or lanoline, and in capillary tubes hermetically sealed, or wide tubes with corks, and small pots with paper or parchment covers. We use glycerine and capillary tubes, and I have no doubt whatever that this is by far the best way of storing the virus. I also add a letter addressed to me (Appendix C) by Major A. Buchanan, I.M.S., Superintendent of the Central Jail, Bhagalpur. 33. Certain experiments are now in progress regarding the keeping qualities of the Assam lymph ; but as they will not be complete until November or December, the results cannot be published much before the next Annual Vaccination Report is due. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., ch.D., Colonel, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam. D
ANNUAL FORMS AND APPENDICES.
13 APPENDIX A. Annual Report of the Animal Vaccine Depot at Shillong for the year 1899-1900. Expenditure. The total expenditure for the year was Rs. 6,991-10-7, being Rs. 738-10-10 less than the previous year. The expenditure incurred by the Manipur State, which is not included in the above, amounted to Rs. 761-12-6, compared with Rs. 762-14 in the previous year. The chief causes of the decrease in expenditure are that fewer calves were required and fewer tubes despatched than in the previous year. Petty construction and repairs. The sum of Rs. 100 was expended in petty construction and repairs. These were unim- portant and require no remarks. Animals. The number of calves purchased during the year was 429 at a net cost of Rs. 3,003. The Manipur State was charged with Rs. 280, so that the cost to Government was Rs. 2,723. The account of calves was as follows : UNPROTECTED CALVES.

Nil. Mortality. The total number of calves that died during the year was 41, compared with 34 in the previous year. The mortality was as follows : Protected calves ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 20 Unprotected ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 21 Total ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 41 Of the protected calves, 14 died without lymph being taken from them and 6 after lymph had been taken. There was a serious epidemic of a form of rinderpest about the end of November and beginning of December. This epidemic affected chiefly a batch of calves brought from Sonapur in Kamrup district. Of the inoculated calves, 4 died in their stalls, and also 12 of the unprotected, though they were segregated and put in hospital. The few remaining calves of this batch, 5 in number, were given back to the contractor, and all work was suspended for 10 days, while the various buildings were thoroughly disinfected. Though work in the depôt was suspended for 10 days yet there was no stoppage in the supply of lymph to the province, as there is always at least 14 days' supply in hand ; and before the supply was exhausted, work was commenced again. With the exception of this epidemic, the calves have been healthy. Most of the remaining deaths were due to cold or exhaustion. Many of the calves are brought up from the plains and are apt to catch cold on the way as the men who bring them do not take sufficient care of them. Expenditure on calves. The net expenditure on calves was Rs. 3,003, compared with Rs. 3,507 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the smaller number purchased, i.e., 429 compared with 501. There are 191 calves in hand, compared with 118 at the end of last year. It will be seen that 72 fewer calves were purchased and 73 more remain in hand, compared with last year. This is due mainly to the smaller number inoculated, i.e., 330, as compared with 390 in the previous year. A smaller number was inoculated this year, as the indents from the plains were smaller, and also because the average number of tubes loaded from each calf was considerably higher than in the previous year. It may seem a large number to show as balance in hand, but it is a valuable asset for the ensuing year, and as each calf costs Rs. 7, this may be looked upon as worth Rs. 1,337. It must be. remembered too, that the balance shown in hand is simply an advance to the contractor, who has men in various directions procuring the calves, and that at present there is not really a single calf in the depôt, but that at any time the contractor can be called upon to E
14 produce as many as may be required. Unless an advance is made in this way, it would be impossible to get calves as required. Feeding charges. Feeding charges were Rs. 251-11, compared with Rs. 283-7-6 in the previous year. Miscellaneous. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 2,454-11-7, compared with Rs. 2,781-5-2 in the previous year. The chief cause of the decrease is that a smaller number of empty capillary tubes was required, as the balance in hand was considerable. Establishment. The establishment consists of one second-grade Hospital Assistant, who gets a special allowance of Rs. 20, one clerk Rs. 10, two loaders, one Rs. 15 and one Rs. 12, one coolie for 12 months and 3 coolies for 7 months, Rs. 9. There is also an additional coolie for 7 months paid from the Manipur State. Compensa- tion for dearness of provisions was given to the 2nd loader and the permanent coolie. The cost of establishment was15 Major Buchanan, I.M.S., was supplied with 100 tubes in November 1899.

The results have been extremely successful, not only in the high percentage of insertion success, but in the very typical resulting vesicles. I have vaccinated now in four central jails in Bengal over 1,200 prisoners yearly, but I have never seen better or more typical vesicles. They are as near aseptic vaccination as is possible on native skins. I have no doubt that your glycerine capillary lymph is much superior to the lanoline lymph prepared at the Darjeeling depôt, which we ordinarily use.&quot; TRIAL OF ASSAM GLYCERINE LYMPH, ADULTS ONLY. Eleven unprotected primary vaccinations, of which all were successful in 4 insertions each = 100 per cent. Twenty re-vaccinations in cases which had marks of previous successful vaccination ; twelve were successful in 4 points each = 60 per cent. Twenty secondary vaccinations in cases which had marks of previous inoculation, all success- ful in 4 points each = 100 per cent. Four secondary vaccination in cases showing marks of previous small-pox ; all successful in 4 points each = 100 per cent. One case successful in 2 points out of 4 insertions (not shown whether primary or secondary vaccination, probably secondary). From the above it will be seen that of primary vaccinations the percentage of successful was 100 per cent. and of secondary vaccinations 82 per cent. Experiments. Certain experiments were made during the year both as regards the composition of glycerine lymph and the length it will keep. It was found that glycerine lymph of the proportion of 1 part solid vesicle to as much as 4 parts glycerine and 4 parts distilled water was as effective as equal parts, but that it did not retain its efficiency nearly as long. Glycerine lymph in the proportion of 1 part solid vesicle, 1 part glycerine, and I part distilled water, i.e., 33 per cent. prepared on 29th July 1899 was tried on the 31st January 1900 and 6th February 1900 in the presence of the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner. Eleven cases were operated on, and in each case every puncture or scari- fication was a perfect success. This lymph had been kept in the depôt for over 6 months for experi- mental purposes, and was as efficacious as at the time of manufacture. At the same time some lymph brought from Sylhet and manufactured in September 1898 was tried, but proved a failure in every case. The scarifications simply dried up, showing the lymph was inert. Two thousand tubes manufactured on 11th February and 15th February 1900 were forwarded to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, to be kept for experiment next season. This will be an interesting experiment to see if lymph will keep in the plains through a hot weather if not exposed to sun-light or heat, i.e., if simply kept shut up in a wooden box. I believe this will prove to be the case. The proportion of the lymph for these experiments is 1,000 tubes 33 per cent., i.e., lymph 1 part, glycerine 1¼ parts, sterilized distilled water ¾ part; 500 tubes 40 per cent., i.e., lymph 1 part, glycerine 1 part, sterilized distilled water ½ part; 500 tubes 33 per cent., i.e., lymph 1 part, glycerine 1½ parts, sterilized distilled water ½ part. Remarks on Hospital Assistant. Second-grade Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta has been in charge throughout the year, with the exception of one month, when he was absent on privilege leave. I cannot speak too highly of his work. He has been of great assistance also in superintending the erection of the new depôt, and it is mainly through his assistance I have been able to carry out the buildings of the vaccine depôt in such a satis- factory manner. General remarks. During the past year a new depôt has been built. It consists of16 Statement of net expenditure incurred on the Animal Vaccine depôt at Shillong during the year 1899-1900. 17 APPENDIX B. Extract from remarks by Colonel C. W. Carr-Calthrop on the preservation of Bovine Vaccine Lymph. * * * * * (a) Bovine vaccine lymph can be used fresh only where there is an establishment in which the calves can be inoculated and children vaccinated on the premises direct from the calf. To take calves sick from the vaccine fever about from place to place would cause a very serious mortality amongst them, and would, in my opinion, be very likely to cause a &quot;scare &quot; in the place where the vaccinators were about to work, and I think in many places the temper and prejudices of the people would never allow the operations to be done. (b) The preservation of the lymph is, therefore, necessary. This can be done in two ways, namely, by admixture with lanoline or by solution in a mixture of glycerine and water. There may possibly be other means of preserving it, but we are only concerned with these two methods. (c) The first is easy, rapid, and cheap, but it is open to various objections ; and is used in the Shillong depôt, only for the preparation of virus intended to be used in the depôt itself for inoculating calves : the small pots in which the mixture is kept are emptied at one time, the lymph, from each calf having a separate pot, and these pots are not allowed to be opened, part of the contents usedand the rest kept for a future occasion. This is to avoid risks of contamination. (d) If lanoline lymph were supplied to district vaccinators, they would have to carry their opened pots about with them, setting them down on the ground, in the sunshine, in the dust, any where, putting in a dirty or bloody lancet from time to time, and, in fact, exposing the virus to various chances of deterioration. (e) For district use, therefore, the second form of preservation is solely used. The vaccine matter as scraped from the abdomens of the vaccinifers is pounded up with a mixture of glycerine and water in the proportion of 2 parts of the solid matter, and 1 part each of glycerine and water by weight. This forms a slightly viscous solution or rather emulsion, which is just sufficiently limpid to flow up into capillary tubes, which are then hermetically sealed by fusing their ends in the flame of a spirit lamp. (f) The advantages of this plan are many and obvious. There is no possibility of foreign matter getting mixed with the virus, it cannot be contaminated by a part being laid on the arm of a child and a portion of this then put back into the mass. Each child receives the contents of one tube. The virus is kept hermetically sealed and the atmosphere can have no effect on it. (g) The defects of the plan are that it is troublesome, laborious, and more expensive than simple admixture with lanoline, but its many manifest advantages compensate for this many times over. (h) The admixture of glycerine and water in the proportion given above does not at all inter- fere with the efficacy of the vaccine germs, and it is certain that they will keep their potency for three or four months, which is more than we require.

Buchanan, I.M.S., Superintendent of the Central Jail, Bhagalpur, to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, dated Bhagalpur, the 22nd November 1899. Inside will be found a detailed report on the very excellent results obtained from use of glycerine capillary tubes which you kindly sent me. The results have been extremely successful, not only in the high percentage of insertion success, but in the very typical resulting vesicles. All my three medical subordinates are greatly pleased with this lymph. I have vaccinated now in four Central Jails in Bengal over 1,200 prisoners yearly, but I have never seen better or more typical vesicles. They are as near &quot; Aseptic Vaccination &quot; as is possible on native skins. I have no doubt that your glycerine capillary lymph is much superior to the lanoline prepared at the Darjeeling Depôt, which we ordinarily use.

New buildings were constructed for the vaccine depôt during the year. The lymph turned out was of the usual excellent quality. Major Buchanan, I.M.S., Superintendent of the Central Jail, Bhagalpur, was supplied with 100 tubes, and reported the results of vaccination with the lymph to be exceedingly satisfactory. A serious epidemic resembling rinderpest broke out among the calves in November and December, in consequence of which all work was suspended for ten days, but as there is always 14 days' supply of lymph in hand, there was no break in the issue of lymph to the districts. A successful experiment was made in vaccinating with glycerinated lymph which had been kept in the depôt for six months, and two thousand tubes were sent to the Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner for experiment next season, in order to discover how this lymph will stand in the climate of the plains. The vaccine depôt was inspected by the Chief Commissioner in September, and Mr. Cotton expressed satisfaction with what he saw. The acknowledgments of the Administration are due to Lieutenant-Colonel R. N. Campbell, I.M.S., for his successful supervision of the work of the depôt. 5. Of the population of the province, 4.66 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, as against 4.44 per cent. in the previous year. Of the total number successfully vaccinated, 61,793 were children under one year of age, the number of such operations in 1898-99 having been 50,389. The number of children under one year of age, as stated in the Census Report of 1891, was 191,720, and the number of births registered during the calendar year 1899 was 179,027. The number of infants successfully vaccinated was thus 32.2 per cent. of the total estimated number available for vaccination and 34.5 per cent. of the registered birth-rate. 6. In the eleven towns in which the Compulsory Vaccination Act was in force, the number of vaccinations again fell, and again no explanation is offered of the continual decline in the number vaccinated. In Sibsagar only were any prosecutions instituted, but of 22 persons prosecuted, not one was convicted. The Deputy Com- missioner will be called upon to explain this result. The number of deaths from small-pox in these eleven towns was 3, as compared with 25 in the previous year. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, L. J. KERSHAW, Offg.

No. 1887. FROM COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, To THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 19th May 1902. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit herewith the Provincial Vaccination Returns for the season 1901-1902, together with a Report on the working of the Vaccination Department for the triennium 1899-1900 to 1901-1902. 2. This report was due on May 15th, but as the last district report, which ought to have reached me on April 15th, did not actually arrive at Shillong until May 6th, the delay of a few days was unavoidable. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., Colonel, I.M.S., Principal Medical Officer and Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
[Prescribed maximum lengthTriennial Vaccination Report. 1. As the number of vaccinations performed in the hill tracts and in the feudatory State of Manipur are known, the statistics given in this report include the population of those regions, and are based on the total population of the province of Assam, viz., 6 126,343, according to the revised figures of the census of 1901. Vaccination agencies. 2. The main work was done by the provincial establishment, aided by the Hospital Assistants in charge of dispensaries to a small extent, as shown by Statement No. III, and also to a still smaller extent by the medical officers and assistants employed on tea gardens. The total num- ber done by all agencies for the last three seasons was 272,265, 271,466, and 280,827, against an average for 15 years of 191,356, showing that steady progress has been and is being made all over. The work done in different districts will be alluded to further on. 3. The average number of operators was 239 in the first two seasons under review and 248 in the last.- The work done by individuals on the paid establishment varied from 2,201 in Manipur, 1,627 in the Garo Hills, and 1,582 in the Naga Hills to 1,318 in Sylhet, 1,176 in Sibsagar, 604 in Kamrup, and 458 in Goalpara. Four districts have licensed vaccinators, and the average work done by them also varied considerably. In Goalpara 858, in Sibsagar 594, in Sylhet 369, and in Darrang 212 operations only were done by each person so engaged. 4. The number of vaccine operations done by the dispensary establishment fell from 24,715 in 1899-1900 to 17,904 in 1900-1901. As I considered this was distinctly due to apathy and indolence in many instances, I recommended the Local Administra- tion to withhold the special allowances given at several dispensaries where the greatest falling-off had taken place, and others concerned were warned to make greater efforts. The good effect of these measures was marked, and in the last working season the number of dispensary vaccinations rose to 23,441. The tea-garden staff have gone on steadily increasing their work in this respect; their average for 15 years was under ten thousand and for the last three seasons they have done over eleven, thirteen, and fifteen thousands, for which I beg to render my thanks. 5. As above stated, the total number of operations performed in the last working season was 280,827, which includes 264,574 successful primary and 7,632 successful revaccinations. This gives a ratio of 44.46 protected persons per mille of population. For the preceding season the ratio was 42.03, and for the one before that, viz., 1899-1900, it was 46.62, but this having been calculated on the census of ten years back may be left out of calculation. The figures for the last two seasons thus show some, if only small, progress. The prescribed diagram showing the death-rates from small-pox during the year 1901 and the average proportion of the population protected during the past 7 years is attached. Percentage of successful opera- tions. 6. As shown by Statement No. I, the percentage or successtul primary operations for the last season was, for the whole province, 97.48, and of revaccinations 81.09. From most of the districts a percentage of about 98 for primary vaccinations is reported ; the lowest ratios coming from the Lushai Hills (91.50), the Naga Hills (95.03), and the Darrang district (95.02) and the highest from Kamrup (98.62), Goalpara (98.79), and the Khasi Hills (99.76). On the whole, I consider the figures as fairly reliable. I am a little more doubtful in the case of revaccination ; a percentage of 81.09 successful revaccinations is not the usual experience ; still the Shillong lymph while fresh is so undoubtedly efficacious, that I cannot say I think the vaccinators fudge the entries in their books to any great extent, but I think they are sometimes inclined to consider the production of small and insignificant vesicles as successes.

In Goalpara the ratio was 43, and in Sibsagar the highest ratio for any district in the plains was returned, namely, 48. The Garo Hills district shows the highest proportion of all, viz., 79. This favorable result is due to the exertions of Military Assistant Surgeon C. Bancroft. The Sanitary Reports for 1898, 1899, and 1900 show that the numbers of children surviving under the age of one year (i.e., births less deaths under one year of age) were 113,425, 143,799, and 148,642, while the numbers successfully vaccinated were 35,521, 45,283, and 37,704; the ratios protected were, therefore, 31.3, 31.5, and 25.4. For the last working season and year the figures are 144,222, 46,961, giving a ratio of 32.6. Verification by Inspecting Officers. 8. In only three districts, did the number of inspection of primary vaccinations made by Civil Medical Officers themselves exceed 4,000; these were 5,211 done by Captain A. Leventon in Sibsagar, 4,401 done by Military Assistant Surgeon Bancroft in the Garo Hills, and 4,100 by Captain H. S. Wood in the Sylhet district. I consider this very creditable to Captain Leventon. The percentage of number inspected by lower agencies was the lowest in the Cachar district, viz., 28. The attention of the Civil Surgeon has been expressly invited to the backward state of vaccination in his district, and it is to be hoped that next year's figures will show a marked improvement. In Nowgong and Goalpara the proportions were 32 and 34, and in Sylhet, Kamrup, Darrang, Sibsagar, about half of the number vaccinated were subsequently inspected, while at Dibrugarh no less than 69 per cent. were verified. This is distinctly creditable to Major Hall. The Native Inspectors of Vaccination have, however, as a class not done well; many of them have given a great deal of trouble, and the sanitary work they have been called upon to do in the off season has been abominably scamped in more than one instance. Most of these men are paid by Local Boards, and there is great difficulty in transferring them, or keeping them in any sort of discipline. The question of the reconstitution of Local Boards is in hand, and when this is settled, I shall propose to replace most, if not all, of these local inspectors by Hospital Assistants of the regular provincial establishment.

Silchar Municipality ... 171 220 182 333 Sylhet 3 have been more so if prosecutions had been more frequently instituted, if, in fact, there had been a little more compulsion. In Sylhet, the number of notices issued was 399,267 and 228. In 1899-1900 no one was punished; in 1900-1901, four people were and in 1901-1902 six were fined. There is but little compulsion in this, and yet Sylhet is the only place in which any one was punished at all, with the exception of 3 who were prosecuted and 2 of whom were fined at Shillong last year. In 1899-1900, the Sibsagar authorities prosecuted 22 persons, but no one was punished, and no others were even prosecuted anywhere else in the whole province in any one of the three years under review. Vaccine depôt. 10. The total number of tubes loaded at the Animal Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, with vaccine virus during the year 1901-1902 was 395,317, as compared with 387,557 in 1900-1901 and 317,382 in 1899-1900 : thus during the last year of the triennium, viz., 1901-1902, the amount of work done at the depôt was the largest and most satisfactory. Of the 432 calves inoculated, virus was only taken from 404, each animal therefore furnished enough to give an average of 979 tubes each, against 1,136 in the previous year. For various reasons lymph was not taken from 28 calves, including the 4 that died after inoculation. The fact that the average number of tubes filled with virus from each calf fell off, is attributed (a) to the percentage of solid vesicle in the lymph having been raised from 33 1/3 to 50 and (b) to 20,000 tubes of about double calibre having been utilised. 11. The total mortality among the calves, both protected and unprotected, was 12, which compares very favourably with the mortality in the two preceding years, viz., 26 and 41. This decrease is a financial gain, and forms an important feature in the working of the depôt. The greater care bestowed on the protection of the calves from cold had a salutary effect on their vitality. The quality of the lymph was generally excellent throughout the year. In the Darrang district the first supply turned out to be of an inferior quality, probably due, as remarked by the District Civil Surgeon, to the heat of the weather at the time of arrival of the lymph in his district. No complaint was received from any other district regarding the inefficacy of the lymph. 12. The total expenditure for the year 1901-1902 was Rs. 8,069-11-11, including Rs. 762-13-1 realised from the Manipur State. In the years 1900-1901 and 1899-1900, the amounts expended in connection with the vaccine depôt were Rs. 7,868-2-6 and Rs. 7,753-7-1, respectively. The increase of expenditure in 1901-1902 was caused by the purchase of more capillary tubes to meet the enhanced demand. Moreover, this year started with only 10,000 tubes in hand, against 50,000 tubes in the preceding year. 13. Lieutenant-Colonel G. Duncan, I.M.S., was in charge of the depôt for the whole year and managed the institution in an efficient manner. He reports that 2nd-grade Hospital Assistant Kamal Charan Datta, who was in subordinate charge, carried out the work of the depôt remarkably well in every detail. Cost of the department. 14. The total cost of the department for the year 1901-1902 was Rs. 22,776-5-3, as against Rs. 22,833-7-9 in 1900-1901 and Rs. 22,938-6-3 in 1899-1900. The small decrease of expenditure during the season 1901-1902 occurred mainly under the head &quot;Travelling Allowance&quot; in the Cachar district. This is probably due to the small amount of travelling done by the Native Inspector of Vaccination of that district, as will appear from the statement relating to the inspection of vaccination work. The Civil Surgeon lately submitted an unfavorable report on this man who is now on leave without pay, and will not be allowed to rejoin. Of the total amount expended during 1901-1902, Rs. 8,673-2-1 were met from Provincial, Rs. 12,011-4-5 from Local, and Rs. 781-1-9 from Municipal funds, and Rs. 1,310-13 were contributed by the Manipur State. The amounts of contributions by the Local Boards increased to an appreciable extent, owing, no doubt, to the number of paid vaccinators having been raised from 186 to 192. The average cost of each successful vaccination was one anna and seven pies, which is the same as in 1899-1900, but less by one pie than in 1900-1901. General. 15. In my report for the season 1899-1900, I observed that it was stated that the practice of inoculation was dying out, and during the year 1899 no epidemic of small-pox could be traced to a survival of this custom; but in my next one, I noted that the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet reported that the prejudices against vaccination seemed to be on the increase rather than on the decline. In their District Annual Reports for last year, the Civil Surgeons, both of Cachar and Sylhet, which together hold nearly half of our population, complain that the practice of inoculation is still carried on and that several outbreaks of small-pox were dis- tinctly traceable to the operations of the Ganaks, and begged that they might be punished. The inhabitants of the Hailakandi subdivision actually petitioned the Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner last April that enforced vaccination might be stopped and inoculation allowed. I need hardly say that prayer of the petition was not granted, but it shows
4 what the attitude of these people is towards all sanitary improvements, and in my Sanitary Report for this year I have recommended that inoculation should be made an illegal operation and the Ganaks performing it made punishable by law. 16. To try to convince the people of the benefits of vaccination, 170 copies of a book called &quot; Small-pox and Vaccination&quot; by Dr. S. M. Das, M.B., were purchased and distributed to all Hospital Assistants and all Inspectors who can read English, and we are indebted as usual to Pandit Gunahash Goswami, Tahsildar of Roha in the Now- gong district, for the very valuable help he gave to the vaccinators visiting his ilaqa. Preservation of lymph. 17. Continued experiments have been made with regard to the keeping qualities of our glycerinated lymph. I caused a certain quantity of tubes from each batch of manufactured virus to be kept for 4 months in my own office table during the last cold season and then distributed to various selected officers with the following results: the Civil Surgeon, Goalpara, reports that about two-thirds of the cases were successful; the Civil Surgeon, Nowgong, found the contents of one box quite useless and that of the other one as fairly good, but not fully equal to fresh lymph. The Civil Surgeon, Sibsagar, succeeded in 4 cases out of 5 and could not do more, as he was detained in his sadr station by judicial duty. The Civil Medical Officer, Garo Hills, found 17 cases, out of 21 primary vaccinations, successful, but only 4 out of 18 revaccinations ; and the Civil Surgeon of Manipur, Lieutenant C. Dykes, who gave the most extended trial, got 143 successes from 160 operations done by himself, i.e., 89.37, while his district average with the regular staff and ordinary lymph was 97.58; he further reports that, although many of the cases were correctly described as successes, the vesicles produced did not appear to be so large and well-formed as usual. The Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal kindly had a trial made in the 24 Parganahs. The Inspector of Vaccination reports that 20 children were vaccinated with the Assam lymph and that the result proved unsuccessful, but he does not state in what proportion. Finally the Inspector of Vaccination of Midnapur reports that out of 24 cases, 10 were successful, 4 doubtful,and 10 failures. 18. I think it may therefore be concluded that the glycerinated lymph as stored in hermetically sealed tubes will not keep for more than 4 months, even in a cool place, and it begins to deteriorate after three months' storage. It has been further ascertained that it will not keep for two months in the plains in the hot weather and probably not for more than one. I presume the reason to be that the glycerine, which at first rapidly destroys all extraneous germs, in time renders the vaccine virus itself sterile and inert. For long keeping, it appears that storage in lanoline or vaseline must be resorted to. As failures greatly annoy the parents of children operated on, I do not propose to make any further experiments with glycerinated lymph, but next season I will try how our virus keeps when preserved in lanoline. 19. The tubes supplied from England are not always of quite the same diameter, and- in some cases the manufactured lymph was found too viscid to be easily expelled from the tubes. In such cases the proportion of glycerine was lowered to 8 parts and the proportion of water raised to 10, that of the vesicular mass remaining at 18 as before. In order to prevent the vaccinators from having to blow out the contents of the capillary tubes after having broken off their ends, a few of Montague's Patent Vaccine Expellers were procured ; these articles are rather like small India-rubber teats, but as their internal diameter varied a little, they did not prove a success and the old oral method had to be reverted to.

14 Statement No. V.SHILLONG : Printed and published by CONYNGHAM FRANCIS, Press Superintendent, Assam, at the Secretariat Printing Office : (Genl.) No. IIIResolution on the Vaccination Report of Assam for the three years 1899-1900 to 1901-1902. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner of Assam in the General Department, No. 6271G., dated Shillong, the 7th August 1902. Read2 6. In paragraph 15 of the report is an allusion to inoculation. The Civil Surgeons of Sylhet and Cachar complain that inoculation is still carried on ; that several outbreaks of small-pox were distinctly traceable to the operation of the inoculators or ganaks ; and it is a surprising fact that the inhabitants of Hailakandi (in the Cachar district) actually petitioned for the stoppage of vaccination and the authorisation of inoculation in its place. Inoculation appears to be widely practised only in the Surma Valley districts, where its popularity seriously interferes with the spread of vaccination. The Principal Medical Officer would have it prohibited by law, and its exercise made a punishable offence. It is doubtful whether the country is ripe for such a measure. 7. The Officiating Chief Commissioner's acknowledgments are due to Colonel Carr-Calthrop for his efficient control of the Department. By order of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, F. C. HENNIKER, Offg.

No. 1828. FROM COLONEL C. W. CARR-CALTHROP, M.D., Ch.D., I.M.S., PRINCIPAL MEDICAL OFFICER AND SANITARY COMMISSIONER, ASSAM, To THE SECRETARY TO THE HON'BLE THE CHIEF COMMIS- SIONER OF ASSAM. Shillong, the 13th May 1903. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward the Provincial Vaccination Returns for the season 1902-1903, with brief explanatory notes, as directed by your letter No. 410M. & S.VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE SEASON 1902-1903. As the number of vaccinations performed in the hill tracts and in the Feudatory State of Manipur and their results are accurately known, the statistics relating to them are based on the total population of Assam, viz., 6,126,343, according to the census of 1901, where not stated to the contrary. 2. The total number of vaccinations performed in the last working season was 304,121 which includes 291,332 primary and 12,789 re-vaccinations. Cachar shows a decrease of 3,883, or nearly 30 per cent., due to extensive practice of inoculation by ganaks. The Deputy Commissioner of Cachar says: &quot; I regret to have to state that in the interior of the district the people prefer inoculation, and I have no doubt that the chronic state of small-pox in the villages is mainly due to the existence of profes- sional inoculators. &quot; The inhabitants of Sylhet are also averse to vaccination, and prefer inoculation. The Deputy Commissioner of this district would , have inocula- tion prohibited by law. Goalpara shows a considerable falling-off, while the rest of the Assam districts show small but satisfactory increases. Good work has been again done in the Naga Hills, and though the number operated on in the Garo Hills is a little lower than in 1901-1902, this is not to be wondered at, seeing what Dr. Bancroft accomplished in 1899-1900-1901. 3. The percentage of successful primary operations was 97.90, against 97.48 in the preceding season, and the ratio of population protected was 48.18 per mille. The low percentage (85.80) of successes in the Lushai Hills is due to the fact that the Lushais suck the vaccinated spot, or apply the juice of the leaf of certain beans to prevent, as they say, ulcers being formed. Assuming that our actual birth-rate is about 40 per mille for the whole population, and that the infantile mortality is 23.7 per cent. of births (that is, taking the mean of Mr. Risley's figures as given in his review of my Sanitary Report for 1901), the number of children available for vaccination would be 186,975 ; the number of infants actually vaccinated under one year of age was 69,787, which gives a ratio of protected children equal to 37.32 per cent., but if the hill districts be excluded, for in them births are not registered, we find that in the remaining portion of Assam 180,475 children,were born during the year, of whom 36,706 died, leaving 143,769 available for vaccination ; amongst these, 46,553 vaccine operations were actually performed, giving a protected rate of 32.38 for the plains districts. 4. The cost of each successful operation was the same as last year, viz., anna 1-7, varying from one anna in the plains to five annas in the hills. 5. The amount of vaccination work done by dispensary agency fell a little, i.e., from 23,441 in 1901-1902 to 22,153 in the last season, owing to a decrease of 3,010 in the Surma Valley districts, where inoculation is extensively practised. 6. The total number inspected by the Civil Surgeons fell off considerably ; this is due to a decrease in the Cachar, Sibsagar, and Garo Hills districts. Captain A. Leventon, the then Civil Surgeon of Sibsagar, reports that he could not see as many cases as he wished owing to his absence at Delhi during a large portion of the best time for inspection. The percentages of numbers inspected by lower agencies increased every- where, except in the Sylhet, Naga, and Garo Hills districts, but the numbers from which the enormously high percentages of successful re-vaccinations reported from the Garo Hills, Lakhimpur, and Kamrup districts, are too small for them to be of any practical value. I personally inspected 166 cases while travelling by myself in the Khasi Hills; with the exception of two rather doubtful ones, the whole were successes : and in the Sylhet district, while in company with Captain Wood, District Civil Surgeon, I inspected 349 more ; of these, only 282 were successes. This gives a percentage of 80.80, but as I rigorously rejected every slightly doubtful case and the work of two of the vaccinators concerned was very bad indeed, while one issue of lymph was not satisfac- tory, the ratio is an abnormally low one.
2 7. The diagram calls for no comment beyond that the death-rates of Cachar and Sylhet were exceptionally high during 1902. 8. Appendix I is a statement showing the number of children available for vaccination in towns, where the Vaccination Act is in force, and the number of opera- tions actually performed. It shows that more than 80 per cent. of the children available for vaccination were protected. The explanation furnished by the Civil Surgeon of Dibrugarh for so small a proportion of protection is that some 88 were too young for vaccination and others were sick. The large excess shown at Gauhati in the number of operations actually performed over the number available is explained by the District Civil Surgeon as due to the fact that among the children vaccinated under one year of age are included those of coolies who passed through Gauhati during the cold season on their way to the railway works at Lumding. The small excess at Dhubri is similarly accounted for. 9. The Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, has been under the charge of Major E. R. W. Carroll, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon, Shillong, from the 7th June 1902. The number of calves inoculated was 621. Of these, 35 died without lymph being taken from them, and from 93 others lymph was not taken either on account of illness or because the quality of the vesicles was not up to the required standard. The number of calves, therefore, which actually yielded lymph was 493, and the number of tubes loaded was 401,870, or an average of 815 per calf, as compared with 395,317, or an average of 978 in the previous year. The quality of the lymph was generally excellent throughout the year. An unfavorable report was received from the Sylhet and Sibsagar districts regarding lymph No. 129. The vesicles of this calf are stated to have appeared as good as usual, and the reason why the lymph proved bad is quite obscure. 10. The total expenditure for the year was Rs. 10,205-8, including Rs. 762-11 realized from the Manipur State, against Rs. 8,069-11-11 in the preceding year. The increase of expenditure occurred almost entirely under the head &quot; Purchase of calves,&quot; and was mainly due to an epidemic of rinderpest, which, from the mortality and sickness it caused, necessitated the purchase of a much larger number of calves. There was also a little increase in feeding expenses and in the expenditure on the establishment. The cost per loaded tube works out to nearly 5 pies each. 11. Major Carroll, Superintendent, Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, furnishes the following remark concerning the composition of the virus as issued by him : Up to the month of September 1902 the strength of the lymph as made up was 50 per cent., during September and October 33 1/3per cent. Early in November the Principal Medical Officer, while on tour, having found the lymph too potent, directed a reduction in its strength ; it was thenceforth made 25 per cent., though in some cases where the vesicles were not of the very finest quality, 33 1/3 per cent. were still made. Equal parts by weight of glycerine and water were used in each case for mixing with the pulp. It was found that lymph of this strength produced decidedly less irritation, while its quality was in no way impaired. I may remark that the lymph made at the Local Government Board Vaccine Institution in London (which I visited while at home) is composed of 1 part of pulp to 6 of mixed glycerine and water, but lymph of this strength would probably soon lose its efficacy if exposed to any heat in the plains. An unfavourable report was received from Sylhet on lymph No. 129, which was corroborated from Sibsagar, where also this number had been sent. The vesicles on this calf were very good, and the reason why the lymph was bad is quite obscure. Complaints regarding one or two other numbers were also received from Sylhet, which were not corroborated from other districts. With the exception of No. 129,I believe the lymph to have been of excellent quality throughout the year. 12. Experiments were made with lymph preserved in lanoline : small pots were filled, sealed down, and kept in my office for periods varying from one to three months; these were then distributed amongst the Civil Surgeons. The results were very un- satisfactory. The Civil Surgeon, Sylhet, reports 7 successes only out of 28 operations with lymph three months old. The Civil Surgeon, Goalpara, did 14 cases, all unsuccess- ful, with lymph of same age, and the Civil Surgeon, Tezpur, did 7 cases, all unsuccessful, with similar virus. The Civil Surgeon, Nowgong, got 7 successes out of 13 trials with lymph kept for two months only, while the. Civil Surgeon, Garo Hills, got 18 suc- cesses out of 20 operations with lymph stored for a little over one month. It is evident, therefore, that our lymph, as mixed with lanoline, will not keep for more than a month or six weeks at the outside. I do not propose trying any further experiments, as failures discontent the people and cause unnecessary dissatisfaction. C. W.

VACCINATION RETURNS OF THE PROVINCE OF ASSAM FOR THE SEASON 1903-1904. As the number of vaccinations performed in the hill tracts and in the feudatory state of Manipur and their result is known, the statistics given here include the popula- tion of those regions, and are based on the total population of the province of Assam according to the census of 1901, viz., 6,126,343. Statement No. I. Vaccine department. 2. The total number of vaccinations performed in the last working season by all agencies was 278,802, against 304,121 in 1902-1903 and 280,827 in 1901-1902, showing decreases of 25,319 and 2,025 operations respectively. Of the 13 districts, 5 show increase and the rest decrease. Decrease has persisted for two seasons in Nowgong, the Naga Hills, the Garo Hills, and the tea gardens. The attention of all concerned will be called to this unsatisfactory state of affairs, with a view to its remedy. The decrease in Cachar is due to the small number of vaccinations done by the tea garden agency and also to the non-receipt of returns from some of the gardens. The Civil Surgeon, Sylhet, attributes the falling off to the fact that during 1902-1903, owing to the prevalence of small-pox, the work had been done for 7 months instead of 6 or 5. The new Civil Surgeon of Kamrup is unable to assign any direct reason. The decrease in Nowgong is said to be due to the absence of a permanent vaccinator for about four months. In Lakhimpur the work was impeded by an outbreak of measles. The Civil Surgeon of the Naga Hills, where the number has gone down to half, ascribes it to the neglect of the vaccinators or to check of exaggeration of figures. The decrease in the Garo Hills is small, and that in the Lushai Hills is due to the fact that, there being no smallpox, the people are not anxious to be vaccinated. 3. The percentage of success in the case of primary operations is a little lower and of revaccination a little higher than in the previous year, being 97.87 and 81.86, against 97.90 and 77.81. The proportion protected per 1,000 of population is smaller, being 44.28 against 48.18. The percentage of success in primary vaccination ranges from 100.00 to 91.94, the lowest being reported from the Naga Hills district ; and in revaccination from 100.00 to 46.15. Statement No. II. 4. The cost of each successful vaccination was a little higher, being one anna nine pies, against one anna seven pies. The highest cost was five annas in the Naga Hills, and the lowest eleven pies in Goalpara. Statement No. III. Dispensary vaccination. 5. The amount of vaccination work done by dispensary agency fell from 22,597 in 1902-1903 to 21,078 in 1903-1904. The decrease is small, and is distributed over the districts of Kamrup, Darrang, Nowgong, Lakhimpur, the Naga Hills, the Lushai Hills, and Manipur. Statement No. V. 6. The percentages of inspection by civil surgeons and by lower agencies on the total number of vaccinations were, respectively, 9.38 and 55.25 in primary and 4.36 and 35.38 in secondary vaccina- tions. In the preceding year the percentages were 8.77 and 54.49 in primary, 4.64 and 34.21 in revaccinations. Kamrup, Lakhimpur, Manipur, Cachar, the Naga Hills, and Darrang show, in the order named, the greatest decrease in the percentage of inspection by the civil surgeons ; and the Lushai Hills, Nowgong, the Garo Hills, Goalpara, the Khasi Hills, and Sylhet in that by lower agencies. The Civil Surgeon of Nowgong did the greatest amount of inspection work, the percentage being 44.07, against 13.06 in 1902-1903. The Civil Surgeon of Cachar could not inspect Hailakandi and remote parts of the district in consequence of his being in charge of the regiment from time to
2 time. The Civil Surgeon of Darrang pleads that he could not inspect a large number as the cases were scattered and their inspection would have entailed a prolonged stay in camp and neglect of other important duties. The decrease in Manipur is attributed to the changes of officers during the year. The small number inspected by the Civil Surgeon, Naga Hills, was due to the civil surgeon having gone round in December, when the villagers were scattered in the fields cutting their crops. The Inspectors of Vaccination in Cachar and Kamrup increased their amount of work by 8.69 and 11.99 per cent., respectively. The large falling off (25.99) in the amount of inspection work done by the Inspector of Vaccination in the Nowgong district is naturally accounted for by the large increase in the verification done by the civil surgeon himself. The decrease in Sylhet was caused by some of the inspectors having been put on cholera duty. The decrease in the Garo Hills was due to the death of the permanent Inspector of Vaccination. In the Lushai Hills there is no Inspector of Vaccination, and inspections are made by the Assistant Surgeon and the Hospital Assistants. I personally inspected 2,187 cases during my tours in the Sylhet district, of which 2,173, or 99.36 per cent., were classed as successful, though the number and quality of the vesicles were not equally satisfactory in all. The same may be said of the cases which I inspected in other districts. 7. The diagram, if compared with that of the previous year, shows that the death- rates of Darrang, Nowgong, and Sibsagar from small-pox were higher during 1903, and that of Sylhet much lower. 8. Appendix I is a statement showing the number of children available for vaccination, and the number of operations actually performed on them in towns where the Vaccination Act is in force. From this it appears that 67.77 per cent. of the children available for vaccination were protected, the highest (85.71) proportion being in the Union of Golaghat and the lowest (39.41) in the Municipality of Gauhati. As to Silchar, the civil surgeon states that out of 114 children shown in column 4, 11 left the town and 31 were not well enough to be vaccinated. Many children, says the Civil Surgeon of Sylhet, were suffering from various diseases, some left the town, and children under three months were not generally vaccinated. The small number of operations at Gauhati is attributed to the slackness of the municipal vaccinator, who also reported that about 80 children in the town were in bad health, and, consequently, could not be vaccinated. The muni- cipal vaccinator of Shillong states that he was unable to find any more children, but the new civil surgeon is not satisfied with this explanation, and is making further inquiries. The vaccination of thirty children at Jorhat was postponed on account of extreme youth and bad health, and six left the town. 9. The Vaccine Depôt, Shillong, was under the charge of Major E. R. W. C. Car- roll, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon, Shillong, during the whole of the year. In all, 520 calves were inoculated. Of these, 7 died without yielding any lymph ; and from 69 others lymph was not taken, either on account of illness or because the quality of the vesicles was not satisfactory. So lymph was taken from only 444 calves. The number of tubes loaded was 429,080, or an average of 966.39 per calf as compared with 401,870, or an average of 815.75, in the previous year. Lymph was supplied to all the civil surgeons in Assam, as well as to various medical officers and managers of tea gardens, to medical officers of regiments in Assam, and to others, on requisition. Complaints were received from Sylhet and Goalpara regarding certain early supplies of lymph of the season. In the case of Sylhet the deterioration was perhaps due to the lymph having been kept for a long time before distribution to the vaccinators. 10. The total expenditure for the year was Rs. 10,815-6-6, including the Superin- tendent's allowance of Rs. 600, and the amount of Rs. 762-15-6 realized from the Mani- pur State. The cost per loaded tube works out to nearly 5 pies ; but if the Superinten- dent's allowance be excluded, the total expenditure comes to Rs. 10,215-6-6, or 4½ pies per loaded tube.

[Prescribed maximum lengthTriennial Vaccination Report. 1. As vaccinations are performed in the hill tracts and in the feudatory State of Manipur, the statistics in this report include the population of those regions, and are based on the total population of the Province of Assam according to the census of 1901, viz., 6,126,343. Vaccination agencies. 2. The work was done by three classes of operators2 subdivision; in the Lushai Hills to the aversion of the people from vaccination, which, never having seen the ravages of small-pox, &quot; they consider a useless operation&quot;; and in Mani- pur to the fact that 29 villages in the hills refused vaccination, because it entailed loss of worktime. The average number of operations for the last triennial period is greater than the decennial average in the case of 8 districts. 8. The proportion protected by vaccination per mille of population was highest (82.11) in the Garo Hills, and lowest in the Lushai Hills (15.83) and in Cachar (20.76). In 1902-1903 the ratio of protection for Cachar was 16.72 ; in the following year it was 19 38. So it may be said that in spite of opposition and the extensive practice of inocula- tion, vaccination is gaining ground in the district. The proportions in the other districts were 51 in Kamrup and the Naga Hills, and 48, 46, and 45 in Manipur, Sibsagar, and Sylhet, respectively. The total average number of infant vaccinations for the last trien- nial period was 67,516, against 59,895 of the previous triennium. It will thus be seen that some improvement as regards infant vaccination has taken place. But in Lakhimpur and Sylhet, at least, the people dislike the vaccination of children under one year of age. Verifications by Inspecting offi- cers. 9. 1 The percentages of inspection by civil surgeons and by lower agencies on the total number of vaccinations were, respectively, 9.52 and 46.50 in primary, and 2.06and 34.41 in secondary vaccinations. In the preceding year the percentages were 9.38 and 55.25 in primary, and 4.36 and 35.38 in re-vaccinations. The percentages of inspection by civil surgeons were greatest in the Khasi Hills and Nowgong, and lowest in the Lushai Hills, Sylhet, Goalpara, Kamrup, Sibsagar, and Cachar ; that by the native agencies highest in Cachar, Manipur, and the Khasi Hills, and lowest in the Lushai Hills and Goalpara. In Sylhet, Goalpara, Nowgong, and the Naga Hills, though the percentage was less, the number inspected was greater. The Civil Surgeon of Kamrup is unable to account for the smaller amount of work done by the Inspector of Vaccination of his district. The decrease in the percentage of inspection by the Civil Surgeon of Goalpara, was due to his illness and to the inability of the Assistant Surgeon in charge to leave the head- quarters. The Civil Surgeon of Sibsagar was three times stopped from going on tour by other urgent duties. The Civil Surgeon of the Lushai Hills states that he visited all the outposts, and did not confine his inspection to large villages adjacent to the headquarters. The native inspector of Manipur did less work owing to his illness for a month. The inspections of the civil surgeons, so far as they went, yielded a success per- centage of 97.72, against the 98.97 claimed by vaccinators. The percentage observed by the Civil Surgeons of the Lushai Hills, the Khasi Hills, and Kamrup was much lower than that claimed. The Civil Surgeon of the Lushai Hills speaks badly of. some of the work done, and, in addition, the Lushais are given to sucking the vaccination-wound immediately after the operation. Working of the compulsory Vac- cination Acts. 10. Appendix I shows the number of children under one year of age available for vaccination in towns in which the compulsory Vaccination Acts are in force, and the number of operations actually performed. Out of 1,591 children presumably available for vaccination, 1,142 children were successfully vaccinated during last season. The percentage of protection works out to 71.78, against 67.77 in the previous season. The large superiority at Dibrugarh in the number of operations actually performed over the number of children available may be due, thinks the Civil Surgeon, to some of those available in 1903-1904 having remained unvaccinated until the vaccinating season just past, and also to new arrivals in the municipality. The worst results were from Jorhat, Sylhet, Golaghat, Sibsagar, Silchar, and Nowgong. At Sibsagar, Jorhat, and Golaghat 5, 8, and 5 children, in the order named, left the town and the vaccination of 77, 25, and 30 children was postponed on account of extreme youth and bad health. The small percentage of protection is attributed at Sylhet to the prevalence of cholera, measles, and bowel com- plaints during last winter; at Silchar to extreme youth, sickness, and emigration; and at Nowgong to inaccuracies by vaccinators in determining age. 11. The province contains 13 circles (municipalities, unions, cantonments, etc.) where vaccination is compulsory under the Acts. The total numbers of vaccinations performed in these circles during the years of the triennial period under review were 2,998, 2,531, and 2,771, against 2,648, 3,143, and 3,264 in the previous triennial period. The increase or decrease in the total number of vaccinations in these areas in the last three years corresponds with increase or decrease in the total number of operations for the province. In the last three years the number of notices issued was 380, 354, and 516 ; and the persons prosecuted were 5, 4, and 2. Five persons were punished in the first year, but none in the last two years of the triennium.
3 Vaccine Depôt. 12. The total number of tubes loaded at the Animal Vaccine Depôt at Shillong with vaccine virus was 444,404 in 1904-1905, as compared with 429,080 in 1903-1904, and 401,870 in 1902-1903, and the average number loaded from each calf was 1,262, 966, and 815. So that during the last year of the triennial period under review the amount of work was the greatest, though the number of calves purchased was less by 55 than in the preceding year. This finan- cial gain was effected by fixing the minimum of the height of each calf delivered by the contractor at 33½ inches. 13. The total of deaths among calves, both protected and unprotected, was 29, most having been caused by an epidemic of a catarrhal nature. The quality of the lymph was excellent throughout the year. A special form was delivered with each box of tubes to enable the vaccinator to report on the quality of the vaccine, in order to ascertain whether failure could be traced to vaccine taken from any special calf. The report did not show a single instance of failure due to faulty vaccine. Most of the civil surgeons reported that the vaccine was of a very high standard. A number of tubes was sent to the Civil Surgeon of Dacca who reported that there was not a single failure in primary operations personally done by him. Captain Leventon and Dr. Gravely of Silcuri also found all their personal cases successful. On only four occasions during the triennium was any fault found with any of the lymph, and delay in using may have been the cause of deterioration. An attempt is being made to maintain the local supply and strain of vaccine without the usual refreshment from Bangalore. 14. The total expenditure for the year 1904-1905 was Rs. 10,289-10-9 including the Superintendent's allowance and the amount of Rs. 764-14-6 realised from the Manipur State. In the years 1903-1904 and 1902-1903 the amounts were Rs. 10,815-6-6 and Rs. 10,805-8-0, respectively. The cost per loaded tube was nearly 4½pies, against 5 pies in the two previous years. The decrease in expenditure was mainly under the head &quot; Purchase of calves.&quot; 15. Major E. C. Hare, I.M S., was in charge of the depôt from the 18th April 1904, and managed it with efficiency. He calls attention to the very intelligent way in which the work was carried on by Hospital Assistant Kamal Chandra Datta, who took a great personal interest in his work, and considered no detail to trivial to merit his attention. Cost of the department. 16 The total cost of the department for the year 1904-1905 was Rs. 25,490-10-7, as against Rs. 24,381-0-1 in 1903-1904 and Rs. 24,955-4-5 in 1902-1903. The increase in the expenditure was mainly under the head &quot; Travelling allowance.&quot; Of the total expenditure of Rs. 25,490-10-7 during 1904-1905, Rs. 10,044-3-10 were paid from provincial, Rs. 13,133-2-9 from local, and Rs. 841 from municipal funds, and Rs. 1,472-4-0 were contributed by the feudatory State of Manipur. The amount contributed by the local boards in 1904-1905 was greater than in the year before, but less than in 1902-1903. The contribution of government increased from Rs. 9,312-4-0 in 1902-1903 to Rs. 10,044-3-10 in 1904-1905. The average cost of each successful vaccination was one anna and seven pies, which is the same as in 1902-1903, but less by 2 pies than in 1903-1904 ; and is higher than in Bengal or the United Provinces only among provinces. General. 17. The practice of inoculation appears to be prevalent only in the Surma Valley : it is rare in the Brahmaputra Valley, and unknown in the hills. Even in the Surma Valley people are beginning to realize the danger of the practice to the neighbours of the subject, and to adopt vaccina- tion on account of its greater safety. Some outbreaks due to inoculation occurred in 1902-1903 in Sylhet and Cachar, and Major Wood found in some instances that the people acknowledged the connexion. It is probable that the time has come for forbid- ding the practice of inoculation. Opposition to vaccination is mostly mild and yields to persuasion or an order from the district authority. But there are certain sects or tribes which have long been very stiff and consistent in their opposition, such as the Mahapurushiyas, the Muttacks, the Thakurias, the Bhakats, the Kacharis, the Lalungs. However, in 1903 and 1904, the Lalungs of Nowgong made a beginning, and in 1904-1905 the Mahapurushiyas and Muttacks of Sibsagar allowed their children to be vaccinated, and a number of the Kamrup Mahapurushiyas also gave in. Some of the Khasis fear to oftend a god by adopting vaccination, and the Muttacks in Sibsagar were for the same reason afraid to take measures against either small-pox or cholera. The hill tribes, except the Garos, are still shy and distrustful of the process. But among the Mikirs the aid of the mission- aries has enabled some work to be done.
4 On the 14th April 1905 the sadr inspector at Silchar found that out of 209 school- boys, 33 per cent. had been inoculated, 65 per cent. had been vaccinated, none had had unmodified small-pox, and 1 per cent. were unprotected. The corresponding figures for 27 dispensary patients were 37, 18.5, 22, and 22 per cent. and for 59 prisoners 42, 27, 22, and 8 per cent. A certain amount of falsification is practised by the paid vaccinators, especially towards the close of the year, when making up their final returns, and some have been dismissed for it. The licensed vaccinators are believed not to be under the same amount of temptation. A desirable reform would be the substitution of approved Hospital Assistants for the present Inspectors of Vaccination. They are better educated, have more influence, know better what they are doing, and can treat the children as patients and not simply as subjects to be vaccinated. They would also be able to afford here and there medical or sanitary aid or advice, and to check the records of vital statistics in a superior man- ner and improve the diagnosis for the death returns.

NOTES ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1911-1912. 1. Introductory.2 9. Composition and Strength of the Inspecting staff.3 If exposure to heat before use had been largely operative as an adverse factor, the results obtained in the districts of Dacca and Mymensingh, where the lymph had been protected from heat, would presumably have been better than those obtained in one rest of the province. The detailed reports for which we asked were not in all cases supplied, but practi- cally the whole of the lymph supply during these two months was reported to be satisfactory and a certain amount of figures as to success and failure of insertions was eturned by some districts. From an analysis of the records of over 2,500 vaccination inspections performed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in different districts, it appears that the lymph was as successful in its results in the districts where it received no special treatment as in the two test districts where measures had been taken to protect it before use from the adverse effect of heat. From the result of this experiment it would appear that if suitable measures are employed to ensure the potency of the lymph by careful selection of vesicles and passage through an alternative vaccinifer, no special arrangements of packing, despatch and distribution are necessary to prevent October and November failures in potency. 13.

As vaccinations are performed in the hill tracts and in the Manipur State, the statistics in this report include those concerning the population of those regions, and are based on the total population of the Province of Assam according to the Census of 1911, viz., 7,059,857. Vaccination agencies. 2. Almost all vaccination operations in the province are performed by depart- mental vaccinators. In tea gardens vaccination opera- tions are performed by tea-garden medical officers. In the first year of the triennium under review there were 331 vaccinators, in the second 330 and in the last 353. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 914 in 1913-14, against 964 in l912-13 and 877 in 1911-12. Total number of operations. 3. Of the 336,649 vaccination operations performed during the year 1913-14, 301,241 were primary vaccinations, and 35,408 re-vaccina- tions, against 333,363 with 98,983 primary vaccinations and 34,380 re-vaccinations in 1912-13, and 305,845 with 290,915 primary vaccinations and 14,930 re-vaccinations in 1911-12. During the triennium 1911-12, 1912-13 and 1913-14, the total number of vaccination operations performed were 975,857, against 803,061 in the previous triennium, showing an increase of 172,796 cases, which is satisfactory. In 19022 The successful percentages in primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations in the case of vaccinators were 98.47 and 78.11, respectively, in 1913-14, against 97.92 and 73.01, respectively, in 1912-13 and 98.19 and 80.28, respectively, in 1911-12. In the case of the dispensary staff the percentages of success were in 1913-14, 93.28 and 88.47, respectively, against 96.20 and 75.41, respectively, in 1912-13 and 97.54 and 94.87, respectively, in 1911-12 ; and in the case of other agencies 97.17 and 71.89, respectively in 1913-14, against 97 46 and 84.49, respectively, in 1912-13, and 97.28 and 83.33, respectively, in 1911-12 Persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population during the year 1913-14 were 45.59, against 44.57 in 1912-13 and 41.85 in 1911-12. I am unable to accept the 100 per cent. of success in re-vaccination operations reported from certain districts. Different methods of vaccina- tion. 7. During the triennium all vaccinations were performed with glycerinated lymph manufactured by the Vaccine Depôt at Shillong. Vaccination work in different districts. 8. The subjoined table gives an idea of the progress made in vaccination in the districts of Assam year by year. By comparing the work of the triennium under review with that of the previous triennium we find that there was an increase in eight districts and a decrease in four. The increase (1,22,741) is most marked in Sylhet, in which a steady increase has been maintained since 1911-12. As remarked in the report in 1912-13 small-pox broke out in the subdivisions of Habiganj, Sunamganj and North Sylhet in this district and a large number of operations were performed in that year. The Civil Surgeon made an experiment to work the district with licensed vaccinators and 11 licenses were issued, but as the experiment was not successful, licensed vaccinators will not be appointed in Sylhet in future. The reasons for the lack of success of this agency appear to be that much difficulty is experienced by vaccinators in realizing fees from the people. The Civil Surgeon in his report acknowledges with appreciation the assistance received from the district executive in combating popular opposition to vaccination. The next highest increase (36,077) is reported in the district of Kamrup. The &quot;Mahapurushias&quot; of this district object on religious grounds to accept vaccination, but their prejudice is being slowly overcome. 20,667 of them have been vaccinated during the triennium under review against 4,013 in the previous triennium. The Civil Surgeon remarks that personal influence is of great value in overcoming this opposition. Nowgong reports an increase of 9,615 operations. The attention of the district authorities was drawn to the very unsatisfactory state of vaccination in this district last year: 8 additional vaccinators were sanctioned by the Local Board and 13,380 operations were performed in 1913-14, which is the highest in record for the last 15 years. This very satisfactory increase is due to the efforts of the Civil Surgeon, Lieutenant Charles Bancroft, energetically supported by the district executive authorities under the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. J. A. Dawson, I.C.S. Cachar follows with an increase of 7,709 operations. Rai Sahib Behari Lal Dhar, Deputy Inspector of Schools, rendered very considerable help to the Civil Surgeon in pushing on vaccination in his district. The increase of 5,946 operations in the Garo Hills is satisfactory. The number of operations performed in 1913-14 is reported to have been double that of 1912-13. The figures are obviously so large for this small and sparsely populated district that I am not satisfied as to their correctness, and I am enquiring into the matter. If accepted as correct they mean that in a district well known for its want of communi- cations and with a density of population of 50 persons per square mile the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 4,000, as against the Sylhet district with a density of 458 persons per square mile and an average of 1,444 operations for each vaccinator. The Civil Surgeon reports that people were under the impression that a single vaccination in infancy is sufficient protection for life, but when it was explained to them that vaccination to be effective must be repeated every 6 or 7 years, a large number of re-vaccinations were performed. The Civil Surgeon of Darrang remarks that vaccination is progressing slowly and he believes that the people now understand its benefit. The prejudices of the Miri sect who were formerly opposed to vaccination are now being overcome. A decrease of 6,699 operations in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district during the triennium as compared with the number of the previous triennium is partly due to the abnormal activity displayed in 1908-09 ; but in view of the fact that the vaccinating staff was strengthened by 5 additional permanent vaccinators and one additional Sub-Inspector of Vaccination in October 1911, more activity should have been displayed. The decrease of 7,228 operations in the district of Sibsagar during the triennium is said
3 to be due to the absence of small-pox in epidemic form. This is probably more or less correct, as the district organisation is a good one, but the decrease in the number of operations performed should be noted and checked.

Consequent on the territorial redistribution effected on the 1st April 1912, the vaccination inspecting staff was allotted to Assam accords ing to their distribution in different districts at the time of the change without reference to their grades. A revised gradation of the inspecting staff was therefore proposed and sanctioned with- effect from 1st April 1913. The pay and grading of the staff, as sanctioned, is as follows:4 The following table shows the successes claimed by vaccinators for primary and secondary operations and those found on inspection by the inspecting staff and Civil Surgeons:5 The cost of the Depôt during the past three years is shown in the accompanying table :6 The Civil Surgeon of Goalpara has drawn attention to a misunderstanding of the meaning of Form 2The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district side by side with the proportion of the population protected against the disease by vaccination during the seven years 1907-1908 to 1913-1914.

BANATVALA, I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, ASSAM, To THE SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the 8th June 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the Annual Vaccination Returns of the province of Assam for the year 1914-15, with brief explanatory notes. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, H. E. BANATVALA, Colonel, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Assam, Enclosures :NOTES ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1914-15. 1. Introductory.2 The lower percentage of success during the year in question was undoubt- edly due to the issue of lymph of a low grade of potency during the months of October and November, as the treatment to which it was subjected before use differed in no way from that of previous years. The question has received departmental attention, orders have been issued and steps will be taken to ensure that a more potent strain is available for use next autumn. The high percentage of success in re-vaccination operations in the districts of the Garo Hills, Sylhet, Naga Hills, Goalpara and Sibsagar requires investigation, and the attention of the Civil Surgeons concerned will be drawn to this. 7. Different methods of vaccination.3 The prejudices of &quot; Mahapurushias&quot; in the district of Kamrup are being gradually overcome. Eight thousand and nine hundred &quot; Mahapurushias &quot; were vaccinated during the year under report, against 8,895 in the previous year. Two temporary vaccinators were entertained for six months in the North-East Frontier district. Their work was included in that of the district of Lakhimpur. 9. Composition and strength of the Inspecting Staff.4 According to rough calculations, out of 2,196 infants available for vaccination, 1,478 or 67 per cent. were vaccinated, as compared with 78 per cent. of the previous year. There is no adequate reason why such a large percentage of children should escape vaccination, and the low percentage shows the laxity with which in many towns the compulsory Act is administered. This defect is receiving close attention, and a more strict observance of the provisions of the Act is being insisted upon. A substantial improvement may be expected in towns where Sanitary Inspectors have been entrusted with the registration of births and deaths. In the towns of Nowgong and Goalpara more than the theoretical number of children available were vaccinated, but the small excess is easily explained by the vaccination of older children who may have escaped notice in previous years and of children who may have been born elsewhere or whose birth may have escaped regis- tration, and the figures show that vaccination has been energetically carried out in these towns as compared with those towns where the defect is considerable, e g., Habiganj. Ninety-five per cent. of available infants were vaccinated in the town of Dibrugarh, in Dhubri 90 per cent., in Shillong 81 per cent., in Gauhati 71 per cent., in Jorhat 62 per cent., in Golaghat 58 per cent., in Sibsagar 49 per cent., in Tezpur 44 per cent., in Sylhet 40 per cent., in Silchar 32 per cent., and in Habiganj 16 per cent. The preliminary notification for the extension of the Vaccination Act to the towns of Karimganj, Sunamganj and Maulvi Bazar has been published in the Gazette and the Act will probably be extended to these towns during the current year. 22. Vaccine Depôt.5 Vaccination Inspecting Staff in this district. As complete copies of tour diaries have not been submitted as ordered, no criticism of the details of the touring work can be made. An explanation will be demanded. In Kamrup, only 8,543 vaccination operations were inspected, against 28,701 in 1913-14 and 35,105 in 1912-13, while the travelling allowance drawn is only some Rs. 43 less than in 1912-13. The inspection work in this district has suffered from the absence on sick leave of the permanent Inspector and the withdrawal of one Sub-Inspector to officiate elsewhere, but as tour diaries have not been submitted from this district, the disproportionate amount of travelling allowance drawn is not understood, and an explanation will be demanded. In this department of the vaccination work also, greater attention should be given by Civil Surgeons to the manner in which the Inspectors or Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination do their touring, daily tours to and from district headquarters must be greatly curtailed. I propose that in future the travelling allowance bills of the Vaccination Inspecting Staff in districts where this practice appears to obtain must be submitted to me for countersignature before they are finally passed and I shall issue orders that not more than seven nights may be spent at headquarters during the month as already noted. Of the total expenditure of Rs. 62,169-9-0 during the year 1914-15, Rs. 39,282-2-5 were paid from Provincial revenues, Rs. 20,456-1-6 from local funds, Rs. 1,254-11-1 from municipal funds and Rs. 1,176-10-0 were contributed by the Manipur State. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Re. 0-3-7, as compared with Re. 0-3-4 of the previous year, an increase which is due to the diminished output of lymph which makes the production proportionally more costly. 14 General.6 The question of the abolition of the practice of employing licensed vaccinators in certain districts, to which reference was made in the Triennial Report, has been considered, and it appears that the system is quite unsuited to Assam. A report on this subject will be submitted to Government in due course. H. E. BANATVALA, Colonel, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.

McCOMBIE YOUNG, M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., SANITARY COMMISSIONER, ASSAM, To THE SECOND SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF ASSAM. Dated Shillong, the 10 th June 1916. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Annual Vaccination Report of the Province of Assam for the year 1915-16, with brief explanatory notes. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, T. C. McCOMBIE YOUNG, Major, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Assam.
NOTES ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1915-1916. 1. Introductory.2 Surgeon arranged the collection of children from neighbouring villages in convenient centres where they were vaccinated under his personal supervision. At the close of the vaccination season four refractory villages in this district, which had refused vaccination for years, are reported to have been vaccinated through the influence of the Deputy Commissioner. The increase in the district of Nowgong has been maintained and the work of the last season shows an advance of 252 operations over the record of the preceding year. In this district during the last 5 years the protected ratio has risen from 27.9 in 1910-11 per 1,000 to 44.5 per 1,000 in 1915-16 and the deaths from small-pox have fallen from 1,013 in 1910-11 to 55 in 1915-16. The satisfactory result has been attained by the administrative ability of the Civil Surgeon Lieutenant C. Bancroft, I.S.M.D., aided by official pressure tactfully exercised by the Deputy Commissioner. The fall of 5,571 operations in the district of Kamrup is due to a reduction in the staff of vaccinators. In this district both paid and licensed vaccinators have been entertained. The Civil Surgeon finding the work of certain of the licensed vaccinators to be unsatisfactory dismissed 14 of them. Seven paid vaccinators were discharged for submitting false returns and some of them could not be replaced. The returns of the year under report although smaller in total are probably more accurate than those submitted in former years and the above decrease is really an index of the attention given to district vaccination by Assistant Surgeon Nalini Prasad Neogi, the Officiating Civil Surgeon. Nine thousand two hundred and twenty Mahapurushias were vaccinated during the year, as compared with 8,900 in the previous year. The decrease of 4,659 operations in the district of Khasi and Jaintia Hills is not satisfactory. The decrease is reported to be due to the grant of leave to one vaccinator, while another was unable to work for a month on account of the prevalence of cholera in his circle, from which disease he subsequently died. I do not consider this explanation to be satisfactory and the matter is receiving departmental attention. The decrease of 1,591 operations in the district of Goalpara is due to bad work by the Inspector and the Sub-Inspector of Vaccination. Both of these have been reported to be lazy and disobedient by the Civil Surgeon and suitable action is being taken. In Sylhet better work has been done in the super- vision of district vaccination, large numbers of unprotected persons have been vaccinated in newly constituted compulsory areas, while there has been a decrease in the amount of travelling allowance drawn, and an increase in the amount of inspection done by the inspecting staff. The work done by the vaccination staff in the district of Lakhimpur shows a decrease of 3,693 operations as compared with that of the preceding year. The decrease is stated to be due to the fact that a permanent vaccinator was ill for two months in the vaccination season and could not do any work, and two temporary paid vaccinators had to be dismissed on account of their work being unsatisfactory. A decrease in the number of vaccination opera- tions performed in the Lushai, Naga and Garo Hills districts shows that the Officiating Civil Surgeons of these districts must give more attention to their district vaccination than they have done. The Civil Surgeon, Lushai Hills, did not despatch his Vaccination Report which should have reached this office on May 1st, until May 17th and it was received in Shillong on 24th May thereby entailing delay in the submission of this report to Government. Departmental. action is being taken to deal with this delay. The return for the North East Frontier district where two temporary vaccinators were appointed last season, has not yet been received. 9. Composition and strength of the inspecting staff.3 were recorded in 1915 and 1,474 children were successfully vaccinated. According to this rough calculation the proportion of 49.03 per cent. of the available children in these areas was protected against small-pox as compared with 67 per cent. in the previous year. Ninety one per cent. of the available children were vaccinated in the town of Goal- para, in Nowgong 87 per cent., in Dhubri and Golaghat 75 per cent., in Gauhati 74 per cent., in Jorhat 68 per cent., in Dibrugarh 62 per cent., in Sibsagar 55 per cent, in Silchar 49 per cent., in Shillong 42 per cent., in Sunamganj 38 per cent., in Tezpur 35 per cent., in Barpeta 32 per cent., in Maulvi Bazar 29 per cent., in Karimganj 24 per cent., in Habiganj 14 per cent., and in Sylhet 7 per cent. These figures do not, however, represent the totals of primary vaccination operations on children over 1 year of age. It depends upon the closeness of the administration of the Act by the Civil Surgeon of the district what number of children are allowed to complete their first year of life without vaccination.. The machinery of the Act is now administered with sufficient efficiency to ensure that few, if any, of these children eventually escape vaccination, but steps are being taken to complete the vaccination of the towns in which it is in default. In the town of Sylhet only 23 children out of an available total of 321 have been vaccinated; this is a poor record of work. 12.

I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, T. C. McCOMBIE YOUNG, Major, I.M.S., Sanitary Commissioner, Assam,. Enclosures :(Prescribed maximum length 3 pages.) NOTES ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM FOR THE YEAR 1917-18. 1. Introductory.2 employed from 40 to 50, and to careful supervision by the Civil Surgeon. In Manipur the increase is reported to be due to vaccination having been carried on throughout the year instead of during six months of the vaccination season. I am not disposed to accept without reserve the figures returned from Manipur, as 2,830 operations per vaccinator is a phenomenal record, being more than double the best seasonal records from plains districts where the population is more closely aggregated and much more easily accessible, and I propose to enquire whether the Civil Surgeon has himself verified sufficient of the returns to be able to vouch for their accuracy, as it would appear as if either the Manipuri vaccinators are exceptionally energetic and their visits unusually welcome or else that their returns are unreliable. The large decrease of 27,012 and 15,188 cases in the districts of Sylhet and Cachar, respectively, is very unsatisfactory. The growing increase in the mortality from small-pox in the district of Cachar is of serious import. The Civil Surgeon attributes the decrease in the vaccination operations to stricter supervision, but an analysis of the figures submitted from this district suggest the contrary view. Whatever may be the cause of the fall, the vaccination of the district should in future receive more attention with the object of increasing the number of operations performed. In Sylhet the decrease is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to a comparative freedom from widespread epidemics of small-pox as compared with the preceding year in which 13 extra vaccinators had to be entertained to deal with epidemics. Statement VII appended to the report shows that there was a further increase in mortality from small-pox in the district during the year under report and that the number of operations performed is the lowest since 1910-11. The explanation given cannot be accepted as satisfactory and it is necessary that more attention should be given to vaccination by the Civil Surgeon, as the system of delegating its supervision to the Subdivisional Assistant Surgeons is associated with the unfortunate results revealed by the returns in question. The decrease of 6,137 operations in the district of Sibsagar is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the following causes3 11. Vaccination in compulsory areas.5 The following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district side by side with the proportion of the population protected against the disease by vaccination during the seven years 1911-12 to 1917-18.

(Prescribed maximum length 3 pages.) NOTES ON VACCINATION IN ASSAM FOR, THE YEAR 1918-19. 1. Introductory.2 Several bad instances of falsification of returns by vaccinators were detected in the district of Kamrup, and 13 vaccinators were dismissed for this reason. There is reason to believe that falsification of their returns has for years been largely practised in Kamrup by the district vaccinators, a fact which vitiates all attempts to criticise the district vaccination figures of former years, and explains the con- tinued prevalence of small-pox in a district with an ostensibly high percentage of protection. The Civil Surgeon, Goalpara, reports that three licensed vaccinators deserted their posts, for fear of being punished for falsifying their returns, and that another was suspended for sending a report of an outbreak of small-pox, which on investigation by the inspecting staff was found to be false. These experiences show the unreliability of the staff with which we have to work, and the need for greater supervision (vide paragraph 10), and the services of a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner are badly required to exercise supervision over the details of the vaccination work. 9. Composition and strength of the inspecting staff.3 13.

[Maximum limit of narrative portion of the report2 5. Dispensary vaccination.3 the vaccination of a whole block of refractory villages. Throughout the triennium the Newgong district vaccination work under Dr. Dodds Price has continued to be a model for other districts where the administration has been less close, and the low- smallpox mortality ratio of this district has been well maintained. There is a drop of 5,859 operations in the district of Sibsagar which is stated by the Civil Surgeon Major Macdonald, I.M.S., to be largely due to the non receipt from tea estates of returns regarding the number of operations performed on them. One notes however that the average number of operations per vaccinator during 1919-20 was only 609, as compared with 1,008 in 1915-16 and 915 in 1916-17, a decrease which is probably not unconnected with the fact that the Civil Surgeon did not inspect any vaccination operations during the season 1919-20, although in part due to the influenza epidemic of 1918-19. The low primary success rate of 86.79 per cent. in the Lushai Hills where the dispensary success rate was 96.86 per cent. seems to indicate that lymph is kept too long by the vaccinators before use. Probably this is more or less inevitable under hill conditions, but the Civil Surgeon is being asked to revise the arrangements for distributing lymph. It seems that in the district of Lakhimpur the extra vaccinators who were engaged on my recommendations have been employed to very good purpose, as in spite of the influenza epidemic Lakhimpur shares with Sylhet the credit of having performed more vaccination operations during this triennium than in the previous one, the actual gain being 9,238.

GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. The Governor and the Minister of Education. Resolution on the Vaccination Report of Assam for the three years ending 1922-23. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Assam in the Department of Education, No. 2781E , dated the 9th July 1923. READ2 4. The ratio of mortality from small-pox in 1922-23 was .38 per mille as compar- ed with .35 and .24 in the preceding two years. Nowgong had the highest percentage, and in the Public Health Report it was stated that the increase there was due to the influx of unprotected settlers from Bengal. 5. The cost of the Department rose from Rs. 71,167 in 1919-20 to Rs. 88,360 in 1922-23, owing to an increase in the pay of the staff. 6. In order to prevent the waste of lymph on tea-gardens owing to extravagant indents, the indents are now checked by Civil Surgeons. The question of charging tea-gardens and railway companies for the supply of vaccine is now under the con- sideration of Government.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the Triennial Report on Vaccination in Assam for the years 1923-24, 1924-25 and 1925-26. Your obedient servant, T. D. MURISON, Major, I.M.S., Director of Public Health, Assam. Enclosures:[Maximum Limit of Narrative Portion of the Report2 carried on in places whenever small-pox cases were discovered. In certain areas in this district, such as Kamalabari in the Majuli where opposition to vaccination is great the epidemic was most severe. 5. Dispensary vaccination.3 The increase was most marked in the districts of Sibsagar (+73,764), Kamrup (+48,773), Nowgong (+21,032), Goalpara (+16,288) and Darrang (+13,303). The services of a number of seasonal vaccinators in the Sibsagar district were retained in order to vaccinate in infected areas throughout the non-vaccination season, i.e., from April to September 1925. It is noteworthy that the Miri people in this district who stubbornly oppose vaccination yielded to persuasion and during the year 1925-26 almost all Miri villages accepted vaccination. Mahapurushias in this district are still persistently opposed to vaccination on religious grounds. The Civil Surgeon reports that the severe epidemic now raging has frightened some of the Mahapurushias to submit to vaccination, but Kamalabari Satra of Majuli which happens to be their stronghold has not yet yielded. The Gossain of this Satra is an influential individual and his opposition induces his followers to do the same. Attempts were made to induce them to accept vaccination but without effect and it is hoped that by constant persuasion their prejudice will be removed. The Deputy Commissioner in forwarding the Civil Surgeon's report has remarked that &quot; there has been severe small-pox in the district for the last year and cases have been far more numerous than those reported. The official statistics give no idea of its severity. Gaonburas are very unwilling to report and it is only seldom that they are detected and can be punished&quot;. Vaccination was made compulsory in fourteen small-pox infected mauzas in this district under the provisions of the regulations published with Local Self-Govern- ment Department Notification No. 1873L.S.-G., dated the 11th May 1925, with the result that all unprotected persons were vaccinated forthwith and the disease was brought under control. In Kamrup district 53 villages were infected with small-pox in 1925-26, of which only one, i.e., Soalkuchi was declared as small-pox infected within the meaning of the regulations mentioned above. Here 2,383 vaccinations and re-vaccinations were performed. The Inspector of Vaccination of this district who is himself a Mahapurushia did good work by his personal influence and tact in inducing a good many of them to yield to vaccination. The services of the epidemic unit staff were utilised in vaccinating and re-vaccinating the people. The increase in the Nowgong district is due to the greater appreciation of the value of vaccination by the people generally. Certain sections of the population such as Lalungs and Mahapurushias who previously were obdurate have now yielded. The progressive increase of vaccination in each year of the triennium under review is satisfactory. A larger number of operations performed in Goalpara district in the year 1925-26 to deal with a wide-spread outbreak largely accounts for the increase. Bhatea (Muhammadans) immigrants in this district are opposed to vaccination and they will not allow their women folk to be vaccinated by male vaccinators. It was with considerable difficulty and with the aid of the Deputy Commissioner, that those at Bilashipara were vaccinated. The number of vaccinators employed by Local Boards in the Sylhet district in the triennium under review was 66 less than that employed in the previous triennium and this partly accounts for the decrease of 16,990 operations. In 1920-21 and 1921-22 there was a severe outbreak of small-pox in the Habiganj subdivision and the usual number of vaccinators employed in that subdivision was largely augmented. In 1922-23 with the suppression of the epidemic the staff was reduced to normal. A total of 24 villages in this district were declared as small-pox infected in 1925-26. The reasons for the decrease of 15,053 in the Manipur State have not been explained. It will be seen from the table that the number of operations performed annually in the State in the triennium has fallen. The attention of the Civil Surgeon will be drawn to this with a view to increasing the number of vaccinations to the level of the preceding triennium. In the Naga Hills the annual average number of operations performed has been maintained but the fall by 7,745 operations in the triennium under report compared with the preceding one is due to an unusually large number of operations being performed in the year 1920-21 to deal with a small-pox outbreak during that year. The decrease of 2,061 operations in the triennium in the Lushai Hills district is due to a large fall below the average in the year 1923-24. One of the vaccinators who was detected by the Civil Surgeon during his inspection to be irregular and falsifying his work was immediately dismissed. The system adopted by the Civil Surgeon in 1925-26 was to employ passed compounders of whom there are many available rather than the ordinary Lushai vaccinators hitherto engaged as seasonal temporary vaccinators. The Superintendent of the district has greatly assisted the Civil Surgeon by pointing out remote villages which were previously unprotected. 9. Composition and strength of the Inspecting Staff.4 10. Verification by the Inspecting Staff.5 The lymph strain was rejuvenated during the triennium by passing it through rabbits. Another process to rejuvenate the lymph strain was tried by human vac- cinated scale which was made into paste and calves were inoculated. The following table shows the expenditure incurred in the Vaccine Depôt in the last three years:7 the following diagram illustrates the death-rates from small-pox in each district side by side with the proportion of the population protected against the disease by vaccination during the seven years 1919-20 to 1925-26.

SHILLONG : Printed and published by H. H. KING, Superintendent, Assam Government Press : (D. P. H.) No. 19GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM. The Governor and the Minister of Local Self-Government. Resolution on the Vaccination Report of Assam for the three years ending 1925-26. Extract from the Proceedings of the Governor and the Minister of Local Self Government in the Local Self-Government Department No. 4033L.S.-G., dated the 23rd August 1926. READ2 Reports show that numerous cases are concealed or are never reported and that the official statistics are always in defect in estimation of the incidence of small-pox outbreaks. The Director in his report has suggested that an easy remedy may be found in the declaration of small-pox as a notifiable diseases in all areas. The suggestion will be examined, but it is doubtful how far the measure could be made generally effective in rural tracts. The establishment of small-pox hospitals in towns is described by the Director as a crying necessity. This is a matter which should receive the attention of Municipal Boards. 6. The cost of the Department rose from Rs. 88,360 in 1922-23 to Rs. 93,203 in 1925-26, the increase being due mainly to the pay of additional vaccinators appointed in certain districts in connection with small-pox epidemics.
