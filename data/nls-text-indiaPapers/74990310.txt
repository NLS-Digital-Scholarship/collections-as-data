FROM THE ACTING SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, Fort St. George, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the Annual Medical and Sanitary Report on the Native Army of Madras for the year 1872. 2. Seasonal phenomena.2 extent by heavy rain.

Subsequently to this the patient slowly recovers, but feels weak and depressed for some time, and the swelling and pain in the joints may last for weeks or months. As a rule, I believe, natives suffer less from the " after-pains" than Europeans and East Indians. In illustration of the sudden nature of an attack of dengue, it may be mentioned that it repeatedly happened that a clerk who had arrived at a public office in the morning, apparently in good health, was by afternoon so prostrated, that he had to be carried home. It need hardly be said, therefore, that an outbreak of such a disease in the case of an army in the field might be attended with serious cones- quences. Fortunately the disease is very rarely fatal, but it may be followed by anæmia, long-standing muscular pains, diarrh4 Total Treated. Died in Hospital.

He was transferred to the small-pox hospital at Singapore on the recommendation of the senior medical officer at that station. The results of vaccination were very satisfactory, as shown in Table No. 9, page 7 of the Annual Return of Sick. A copy of my report at the time on the subject was furnished to the Inspector-General. I took the opportunity of suggesting the advisability of revac- cinating the regiment, including all followers, a short time before going on foreign service, as both life and expense to the State would be considerably saved, I believe, in consequence. Dengue appeared in the regiment on the 24th August 1872, and the last case was admitted on the 23rd November 1872. Total number admitted 351. About 23rd November heavy rains set in, and I believe had the effect of driving away the epidemic. At the commencement the disease was attended with more acute symptoms. Cases became milder as the disease began to decrease. No death occurred from it. The average duration of each case was 9.06 days. The symptoms were very high fever, resembling the preliminary fever of small-pox, generally lasting two days; pains in all the joints, rarely swelling; tongue always pecu- liarly white; constipation rarely occurred. Treatment. CENTRE, OR PRESIDENCY, DISTRICT. 19 Dengue was epidemic in the regiments from May until October. Altogether 508 cases were admitted into hospital. Many of these were, however, relapses. No deaths occurred from this disease. Ventilation of the hospital .20 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. Vaccination. Vaccination .NORTHERN DISTRICT. 21 Foot-soreness .22 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. The vegetation of the district consists principally of acacias, casuarinas, palmyras and sago palms, mango, and banyan trees. The fruits comprise mango, custard-apple, pomegranate, orange, citron, lime, guava, roselle, &c., while amongst vegetables, yarns, onions, brinjalls, sweet-potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, turmeric, cucumbers, and various kinds of gourds are common. Most description of European vegetables also thrive readily. Of the grains and pulses very many descriptions of paddy, cumboo, raggi, cholum, and some half dozen varieties of gram are commonly cultivated, while of oils are extracted cocoa- nut, mustard, cotton, rape, linseed, castor. Medical topo- graphy. Medical topography.NORTHERN DISTRICT. 23 parade ground is very slightly elevated at its centre and at its north side, but sufficiently so to ensure the free passing away of storm water. The soil is dark loam, much infested by white ants. The place of arms is very clean, but the stone pavement is very irregular from the blocks having been badly laid, and also much worn. The ventilation is good when the doors are open. There are no windows. The drainage is by natural configuration of the ground and sufficient. There is no latrine near the place of arms and guard-room. The men resort to the ground at the north or rear, on which are mounds of earth and broken bricks, the remains of regimental lines. No nuisance can be detected near the place of arms, and the air in the neighbourhood is pure. A latrine with earthen walls could easily be erected fifty or sixty yards behind the place of arms. The ground there is waste and clear all round. The lines are one-third of a mile from the north-east corner of the parade ground, and are built on ground which has a decided slope from west to east, in which direction the rows of huts are placed. The general appearance of the lines is very satisfactory. The huts are on raised platforms. The courts are on the street side, and have good pials. The walls are of mud, well whitewashed, and the roofs are tiled. Ventilation is deficient, as it always is in regimental huts. The drains at each side of the streets are unlined, and have become shallow, by filling up with sand. The soiled water from the courts runs into these drains by drain tubes passing under the pials, and accumulates in some places. Men are at work deepening the drains, straightening and embanking their sides. I have recommended that pits be dug at the bottoms of the drains, where the soiled water issues from the courts, and a bamboo spout be fixed in the conduit under each pial. If a tarred chatty is placed in each pit, the house drainage will be caught and can be carried away and deposited at a distance daily. This arrangement will be for the hot season. In the rains the decided slope of the drains must carry all nuisances rapidly toward the low ground between the lines and the Maharajah's tank on their east side. There are no public latrines in or near the lines. Indeed there are none in the canton- ment. Yet odors of nuisances are not noticed anywhere. There are eight scavengers attached to the regiment, and they clean the street and drains daily. The men, as well as the women, resort much to the latrines in the corners of the courts of the huts. These latrines are cleared by female toties employed by the families. Water-supply.24 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. Diseases. Diseases. NORTHERN DISTRICT. 25 Diseases. 26 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. from this cause, in my opinion due to malarial exhalations arising from the ground immediately after its being saturated by the annual rains. The usual form of the fever is quotidian, very seldom tertian, and I have never seen a case of quartan. Sometimes double quotidians are met with. Occasional cases of remittent fever occur, and when complicated with bronchitis or pneumonia become dangerous. It is not frequent that the head becomes complicated in this fever; occasionally diarrhoea sets in, but the complications most to be feared are pneumonia and bronchitis. The left wing of the 31st was inspected by Deputy Inspecter-General E. S. Tribe in December 1872, and the following are extracts from his report:NORTHERN DISTRICT. 27 bank of the Mahanuddy adjoining the station and regimental lines; on same side is the regimental bazaar; to the westward of the cantonment road is the general parade ground, the Protestant Church, and ruins of the fort, of which nothing now remains but an entrance gate and a raised mound in the centre. There are within a few buildings used as magazine stores, also the station gymnasium, billiard-rooms, and racket court. A deep ditch surrounds the fort, which gets filled during the rains, and during the hot weather partially dry up, and from the constant growth and decay of rank vegetation it gives forth most offensive odors. It is being gradually filled in. Adjoining is the small parade ground, a space about 302 yards long, 132 yards wide, running east and west. To the south of this is the regi- mental hospital, and immediately on its front are two large tanks, each measuring 230 feet long, 220 feet wide, and in depth about 20 feet. These have constantly been condemned by Medical officers, as being injurious to the sick on account of their close proximity. I experienced what they were during last hot weather, and can confirm their statement; for at a time their smell was most sickening. However by keeping them cleaned of all vegetation the evil was reduced to a minimum. The town contains about 80,000 inhabi- tants; is irregularly built; has many large buildings, dwellings of natives, besides pagodas and a number of fetid stinking tanks; the streets are generally narrow, and as far as I can see there is very little attention paid to sanitary matters. There are many buildings of public utility, such as the Commissioners and Collectors' Cutcherries, the Judge's Court, Jail, Lunatic Asylum, Normal School, Baptist Mission Schools, and Civil Hospital.

Did all those affected come from the same street in the lines, or different ones? I found as follows. B. Company's Lines 2 C. do. 3 E. do. 3 F. do. 6 H. do. 2 Total 16 From this it was evident that the nucleus of the disease was not brought to the regimental lines by any single individual, but that it was all at once wide-spread, and that all were contaminated. Then how did it happen ? That point, I thought, may be cleared up by asking how these 16 men were engaged the evening before the morning of the attack. They were all, except one who was on the Quarter guard, off duty, and visited the Regimen- tal Bazaar, as usual. On that day many persons had also come to Regimental Bazaar from across the river with grain, &c., from the Balasoor neighbourhood, where the fever was prevalent, and in all probability some were at that time affected and had given the disease to the sepoys. I have no doubt in my mind, but it was in this way that it first got footing in the station. But then how did the man, on the Quarter guard, get the fever, simulta- neously with the rest? Simply being visited by one of the others, a friend of his, who is included in the 16. During all that day, viz., September 9th, men were reported sick with exactly the same history and symptoms which I have noted; by evening time the number had risen to 32. At this period, I confess, I was rather mystified at not seeing a single case in which a rash was apparent or temperature over 101° F., but when I considered and asked the men, how long was the fever on them before they came to hospital, the answer was invariably 3, 4, or 6 hours in no instance did any report sick immediately, and many not until they were necessitated from their pains to throw themselves down and roll in agony. From this exceedingly rapid invasion of the disease, it very soon became impossible to take notes on individual cases or indeed to classify them according to the different symp- toms which became apparent. One of my assistants got incapacitated, and the other had more than enough to do in attending to the wants of the inmates in Hospital, besides numerous calls from the families in the lines, as the disease had rapidly disseminated itself among them, and was daily prostrating them in large numbers. The general train of symptoms in all the cases admitted to hospital were high fever, temperature never more than 102° F. which was only seen in a very few, intense frontal head-ache, in no case was it absent and lasted until the fever passed off, generally after 48 hours, severe pains in loins, and back pains and stiffness in all the joints and muscles of back of neck, with a general feeling of wretchedness, sleeplessness, and prostration; lips and fingers appeared swollen and a sensation of bursting felt in them, many had loss of power over the flexor muscles of the hands, soreness of heels and soles of feet were complained of by many, while others had swelling of the knee and ankle joints, the latter most noticeable in the space between tondo Achillis and malleolus.

I may here remark that nearly all these children who died were not seen.previous to being insensible, and then medicine was useless. The treatment of children consisted of powders of calomel, and James', followed by diaphoretics, and the application of blisters to the head on the slightest symptom appearing of the brain being affected.

It is said to be fully 25 years since the tanks received so large a supply of water. In the fort ditch the water level reached the highest known level, topped the calingulah or waste weir, and for some hours threatened to breach it. This was not so much the result of an excessive annual fall as of heavy downpours within a few consecutive days. The total number of rainy days for the year was 62. PUBLIC HEALTH.

Thus, while in 1871 the larger number of deaths were registered in the first half of the year, and in the first " quarter " of that year, in 1872 the largest number was recorded against the second half and the last quarter of the year. Again in 1871 the largest mortality is recorded in January, and in 1872 in July. Birth-rate. Birth-rate. 44 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. Bellary . 1871. 1872.

Some years ago, upon my representation in my then capacity of Sanitary Commissioner, I suggested this system, and the Government ordered a few privies to be constructed in the lines of the 39th Regiment at this station. They were built and duly reported upon, but I do not know what orders were passed by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and Government. I believe the cost did not exceed Rupees 1-8-0 for each latrine, which would be about Rupees 1,000 for an entire regiment of 600 rank and file, with the usual complement of Native Commissioned and Non-commissioned officers. In another part of this report the appalling mortality amongst the families and follow- ers living in the lines of native regiments is shown, and I cannot but attribute much of this to the damp and polluted sub-soil, the result of years of bad drainage and sewerage.

This measure has afforded a considerable saving in the hire of puckalies, besides ensuring a greater purity of supply. The native troops draw their supply from tanks and wells, the former principally Mil- ler's tank and the reservoirs at the head of the Ulsoor Valley, which have been recently deepened by the municipality, under a special grant of money by the Mysore Government, in view to a larger storage of water. This work necessitated the removal of the vegetation and fish which kept the water of these reservoirs so pure, and for a time has rendered the water turbid and muddy, but steps have been taken to re-plant the vegetation and re-stock with fish.

I need not say that I have directed him to examine them all and vaccinate those who require it. I do not think it necessary to comment upon the returns of each regiment. I shall inculcate upon Medical Officers the necessity for vaccinating all unprotected persons during the current year. The following table is an abstract of vaccinations performed by Medical Subordinates, and scarcely requires any commentary. The aggregate numbers vaccinated (1,261) are small, compared to the strength of troops, families, and followers.

The death-rate is, however, in excess of either previous years, being 3.27 per mile in excess of that for 1870, and 2.44 over that of 1871. Invaliding is largely in excess of that of the two previous years, being three times nearly that of 1871, and twice that of 1870. The constantly sick-rate is almost the same as that of the year 1871, but slightly in excess of that of 1870. The next statement exhibits sickness and mortality as influenced by seasons as gathered from the quarterly returns:53 MYSORE DIVISION. The entire absence of cholera is a notable and gratifying feature of the year. Nine cases of small-pox came under treatment, five at Bangalore, two at the French Rocks, and two at Bellary with one death, which occurred in a sepoy of the 16th Regiment Native Infantry. The fever known as "Dengue " prevailed at Bangalore and Bellary only, contributing 334 cases at the former, and 115 at the latter station. Fevers of 'intermittent type were most prevalent at Mercara, where the admissions equalled 321.21 per mile of average strength. The next highest ratio is met with at the French Rocks, 240.7 per mile. Then follows Mysore (258.20) and Bangalore, the lowest in the Mysore Command, 199.66. At Bellary the ratio is only 33.13, a marked contrast as remarked in former reports to stations in the province of Mysore. There has been but a small prevalence of the graver forms of fever of the remittent type , eight. cases being recorded at the several stations in Mysore, and four at Bellary. But the mortality is high, no less than six of the twelve cases having died. Of the eight cases in Mysore, four, with four deaths, are recorded against Bangalore, three occurred at Mercara, and one at the French Rocks. There is no record of a case of typhoid or enteric fever; but some cases returned as remittent had enteric complication and other symptoms of this specific fever.

But it must be noted that in some instances the mortality is terribly high. The 39th Regiment at Bangalore continues to show a lamenta- bly high rate, though it is exceeded by that at Mercara. The lowest mortality is at the French Rocks, where it is only 17.65 per milk of estimated population. But in estimating the mortality of this section of the community it is necessary to include the sepoys themselves, the husbands and fathers of the women and children who constitute the bulk of the civil community of regimental lines. Adding to the strength and deaths given in the above table (IX.), the strength of sepoys and deaths amongst them it raises the aggregate strength to 16,619, and the deaths to 437, giving a ratio per milk of population of 26.3. In like man- lier in the case of the 8th Regiment at Mercara it reduces the mortality of all classes to 38 per mille, and the 39th at Bangalore to 33.8, which are still very high death-rates. Con- trasting these results with the mortuary returns received for the cantonment and town of Bangalore, and for the cantonment of Bellary, I find that the mortality is as follows:MYSORE DIVISION. 57 STATEMENT NO.

Nights in bed. Nights in bed .MYSORE DIVISION. 61 The inhabitants of the lines do not enjoy the amount of cubic space which we con- sider necessary for health; but they are not overcrowded according to native ideas and customs. There has been no overcrowding in guard-rooms or hospital. The drainage of the lines is as defective as it can be, and this is another cause of the prevalence of zymotic disease. In the old lines there is no drainage, but these are in the course of removal. The new lines are laid out in straight or slightly curving streets with yards in front, and a narrow channel cut in the soil running parallel with the huts, which receives the sewage from the huts and yards. These channels fall into large channels at right angles with the streets, which, in the rainy season, carry away the storm water and sewage into the valley below; but in the dry season the sewage stagnates in the channels in front of the huts, or sinks into the ground. Some of these channels are on a dead level, so that the sewage cannot flow off; but even a good fall would fail to prevent the soil being con- taminated with sewage. Some materials impervious to moisture must be laid down to con- duct the sewage away from the huts. I have ascertained that stone-channels would cost about Rupees 8 per yard, so that is out of the question. I have already mentioned in other reports what I propose as a substitute, viz., bricks half a yard long shaped, thus fitting into one another to form a continuous line; the surface to be glazed or tarred. These bricks are now being made in the jail at a cost of 8 Annas a yard, and I am con- fident that the expense of glazing, cementing, and laying down would not bring the total cost to more than 12 annas a yard. There are two water-courses which, arising on the slopes of the valley, unite at the bottom in the swamp before mentioned, from which a single stream carries off the surplus water through a break in the valley to the westward. This swamp I consider to be the cause of much sickness. It has been drained as far as possible during the last three months, and the ground has been cultivated with the sun-flower plant. The health of the troops and families has certainly much improved since this was done, but whether from this cause time only will show. The lines were formerly imperfectly cleaned: heaps of manure and rubbish were found here and there, but at my request these were removed, and the surface is now very clean. The sanitary condition of the latrines has been much improved. The sepoys have been induced to use the dry earth, and the urine now falls into tarred iron-buckets instead of sinking into the soil. But the buildings are unsuitable for the purpose, and during the rain the dry-earth system cannot be carried out for want of store-houses for the earth. The state of the water-supply has been before mentioned. The bad water is no doubt a very potent cause of disease. Deputy Surgeon-General Ranking, who inspected the corps in November, reports as follows:62 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 23rd Regiment Right Infantry.

The general health of the men appears to me to have fallen off considerably during the past year. This, I think, may be explained by their altered circumstances. While at Thayet- myo their diet was good and ample, being rationed by Government. They were well housed, and duties were light, and the climate did not appear to be in any way injurious. At Banga- lore, on the contrary, the hutting has been bad, often scarce affording protection; the duties have been heavy, involving exposure to the cold and damp; and it is most probable that in many cases the diet has been insufficient. There is, however, reason to suppose that, during the current year, the health of the men may improve. The new huts will be ready for occupation before the monsoon, and most probably the duty will not be so heavy. There have been 17 admissions from venereal diseasesMYSORE DIVISION. 69 39th Regiment Native Infantry.

The room is 20x17 feet, which gives a superficies of 340 feet. The guard, exclusive of sentries, to be accommodated at night consists of 12, so that each man has only 28 superficial feet, which is far too little. Prisoners in jails have a minimum of 36 feet, and native troops should certainly not have less. Neither is there a prison-room attached to the guard-room, Consequently prisoners have to be also accommodated in the guard-room to the further reduction of space. Water-supply.

These three cases which terminated fatally would in all probability have occurred anywhere. The health of the majority of the European Officers and their families was also very good during the year. The 2nd Cavalry was inspected by Deputy Surgeon-General Ranking, who makes the following observations:76 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. is one, I think, requiring a special reference by the Inspector-General, for if a Cavalry Regiment is to continue to occupy this station, the construction of new lines and of a new hospital cannot long be deferred.

The immediate neigh bourhood is also clean and well kept. Hospital baths &c., Hospital baths, &c .CEDED DISTRICTS. 77 rooms are also roomy and well ventilated. The huts are in common with most native dwel- ings, small, dark, and ill-ventilated. An opening about nine inches in diameter has been made in the back wall of each to admit air. The drainage, which was exceedingly bad when the regiment arrived here, has now undergone every improvement that can possibly be carried out. There has been no lodge- ment of water anywhere in the lines during the rains. The drains, which are all surface, are kept thoroughly cleaned, and dry earth laid down, when slopes run into them from the courtyards. No foul odors can at any time be found in the lines. Hospital.

The immediate neighbourhood is kept very clean. Much prickly-pear bush has been removed, but a good deal still remains around the tank to the south-west of the lines. There has also been some trouble regarding the pollution of the water of this tank by rotten vegetation, eradicated prickly-pear which was buried some time ago too close to it. But this is of less importance, now that there is an abundant supply from other sources. Water-supply. Water-supply. 81 PROVINCES OF MALABAR AND CANARA. PROVINCES OF MALABAR AND CANARA.

I accordingly deputed Passed Hospital Apprentice Veramahali, of the Cantonment Hospital, for the duty, selecting him because he had been with me at several of my examinations in the lines and quite understood my plan of proceeding. He was specially instructed that there was to be no selection, but that the young people were to be taken at random, just as they came to hand. The result of his examinations is shown below:92 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. An excellent market has been provided, consisting of beef market, mutton market, vegetable market, and poultry and fish market in separate buildings, the whole enclosed in a spacious quadrangle, which is now complete with the exception of one side. Public latrines have been provided, though not as yet in sufficient numbers. In that part of the town most notoriously unhealthy (Nullagoottah) a large number of huts has been cleared away, compensation being given to the owners. Waste grounds have been resumed, walls of compounds lowered, side-drains constructed, noxious trades, such as tile, pot, and lime burning, removed, and permission refused to erect any new buildings in the more crowded localities.

100 MEDICAL AND SANTARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. HYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. Supplementary Annual Return of Vaccination performed by the Medical Subordinates in the Cantonment of Secunderabad during the year 1872.101 HYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. The following is an interesting report by Deputy Surgeon-General Barclay on the outbreak of cholera at Secunderabad in the year 1872, which lasted from 5th November till nearly the 31st December:102 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. 10. The disease hardly spread anywhere beyond the town, and since the middle of December no cases have been reported in any other part of the Nizam's dominions. 11. The only regiment here where any cases occurred during the outbreak was the 29th Native Infantry, into which the disease was introduced by a follower, who contracted it at Chudderghaut. The number of attacks among men and followers of this corps was five, with three deaths. 12. In the villages within cantonment limits there were but three cases, with one death. Among the European troops no case occurred. 13. The arrangements adopted on the appearance of the disease were the same as those made in 1871. A medical subordinate was placed at the disposal of the Cantonment Magistrate, and posted, with a supply of medicines, at the Police Station in James' Bazaar, for the purpose of visiting from house to house in the town. He was also provided with a conveyance. Patients, whose friends consented to their removal, were sent to the Civil Dispensary, where they were treated in an isolated building, provided with a separate establishment of servants. Others were attended to at their own houses. Compulsory removal was not attempted, having been found impracticable in the epidemic of the previous year. 14. Conservancy was carefully attended to both in the town and in the lines of the different regiments. In these lines certain wells had, long before the appearance of cholera in the station, been set apart for drinking purposes, and placed under sentries. 15. The treatment adopted was chiefly the saline mixture used at the Madras General Hospital. In cases of collapse diffusible and other stimulants were given, and in slighter cases emetics, chlorodyne, and cholera pills without opium. The usual external appliances were also used. 16. Table C (Appendix No. IV.) gives the daily mean of the meteorological observations at Secunderabad for the months of October, November, and December 1872; but there seems nothing in it calling for remark. The chief seasonal characteristic of the year was the unusually late and abundant monsoon. Up to the end of August only 17.08 inches of rain had fallen, but by the end of October the rainfall amounted to 31.69 inches, and by the end of the year to 35.52 inches, being 8.23 inches above the average. In the beginning of November the tanks were fuller, it is said, than they have been for upwards of 20 years. Nullagoottah, as already mentioned, is close to the Hussain Saugor tank, and part of it was under water. I do not, however, imagine that there was any relation, in the way of cause and effect, between this and the outbreak of cholera. 17. I have only to mention, in conclusion, that, subsequent to the termination of the epidemic, three isolated fatal cases of cholera occurred in Secunderabad townHYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. 103 APPENDIX I.104 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS.

Translation of a Note from the Officiating Resident at Hyderabad, to His Highness the Nizam's Minister, No. 1,720, dated 26th July 1872. Referring to the reports of the prevalence of cholera in the interior of His Highness the Nizam's country which you kindly furnish me with from time to time, I beg to state, for your consideration, that very much of the value of these reports is entirely lost (1) by their reaching so late, and (2) by the locality of the places to which they refer being in many cases not correctly ascertainable, owing to the want of a proper map showing the districts and taluqas in His Highness' dominions. 2. The first evil referred to will, I have no doubt, be at once removed by your issuing impera- tive orders to the local authorities to observe strict punctuality in the transmission of these highly important reports. As regards the second, I would request the favor of your kindly instruct- ing the several reporting officers to particularize in each instance the situation in relation to other well-known places and roads, and the approximate distance from Secunderabad of the village or pargannah in which the disease is said to be prevalent. 3. This extra labor would be avoided if the officers, to whom these cholera reports are forwarded by this office, could be placed in possession of a comprehensive map of His Highness the Nizam's territory. 4. I am aware that good maps of His Highness' country are perhaps not yet available. Now that the Public Works Department has been so much improved, it would be well if the preparation. of such maps could be kept steadily in view so that maps worthy of the dignity and importance of His Highness' dominions might gradually be prepared. 5. Copy is forwarded, for information, of the letter from the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, Hyderabad Subsidiary Force, in which this reference has originated, and in the interests of the European garrison of Secunderabad, as well as of the masses of the people generally, I trust you will have the kindness to cause effectual steps to be taken to improve the character and increase the value of the information of this nature which is in future transmitted to me.

There is a large public latrine to the north-west of the lines and a small one to the east of the barrack for the use of the quarter-guard. Both are kept clean by daily removal of excreta, and the approaches to both are in good order. The latrine belonging to the Quartermaster Serjeant's quarters is under the same roof with the cook-room, which is an objectionable arrangement. The provision of a separate latrine has already been recommended. There are no cess-pools or foul drains. Rations. Rations. HYDERABAD SUBSIDIARY FORCE. 115 Medical topo- graphy.

Surgeon-Major J. T. Williams held medical charge, and the following are extracts from his report:NAGPORE FORCE. 121 The hospital accommodation, though generally sufficient, was not enough during the months of September, October, and November. The Detail Hospital was also slightly overcrowded, so that the additional accommoda- stion required for the regimental sick was obtained by using the hospital verandah with the purdahs let down, taking care to arrange the sick so as not to interfere with the ventilation of the hospital. The duties of the men, though considerably increased during the drill season, do not appear to be severe or injurious to health. Head-Quarters, 32nd Regiment Aatibe Infantry. The head-quarters of this corps occupied Hoshungabad during 1872, and the annual report was written by Surgeon-Major A. L. T. Cooke. Climate is of medium character, neither excessively hot nor cold. The cantonment of Hoshungabad is 1,500 feet above the sea. The cold season is seldom cold enough to be thoroughly bracing. December and January are moderately cold, particularly in the early mornings, average temperature being 56.0, and frosts are not uncommon. An easterly wind is prevalent during these months, being the cause of much sickness among the sepoys in the form of intermittent fever. The sun throughout the day during these months is not excessive, and moderate walking exercise can be taken without causing distress. In the hot season the sun during the day is excessively powerful. After sunset there is a marked diminution in the temperature, and the nights are cool, and this is in a great measure owing to the nature of the soil122 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. hospitals in his range having been re-built. It is but a few inches above the surrounding ground, and though every other hospital that I have seen in these provinces is tiled, this at Hoshungabad is thatched. The hospital is of course clean, and it is well ventilated and drained. It accommodates 28 patients comfortably, and is supplied with water from wells. The latrine has just been re-roofed, and not yet given over to the hospital authorities. There are stone slabs with a hole in the centre to serve as seats; but, as natives squat on their feet, I fear the stone slabs will be dirtied. Vaccination. Vaccination .BRITISH BURMAH DIVISION. 123 no levelling has ever been made out can hardly have been so applied as to neutralize the faulty laying of the lines. The 35th Regiment arrived at the commencement of the year, and during the months of March, April, May, and June there were no fewer than 49 deaths among the camp-followers, which, as there are only 1,600 of them, amounts to 3 per cent. Some three weeks since myself and Surgeon Sibthorpe went over the lines together and came to the conclusion that the portion of the lines occupied by the 4th and 5th Companies were in the worst sanitary condition. In order to see if this opinion was borne out by facts, I procured a return showing the number of deaths among the camp-followers according to companies with the following result:124 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. The clothing generally suitable and adapted to the varying climate of the country. The duties and drill of the troops beneficial to their health rather than otherwise. The time in bed from two to three days' interval. Vaccination is kept up as systematically as possible, the difficulty of having fresh lymph always at hand being considerable. The absence of children with the sepoys being one cause of this, the lymph also in tubes often failing. The punishment-cells are upon the whole in good order. Some few are reported slightly defective in ventilation, which will soon be rectified. The hospitals throughout are in a very satisfactory state as regards position, sanitation, and commodiousness. The drainage is everywhere attended to, and, when defective, has been remedied. The water-supply has been good and abundant. The cooking good. Lime-washing of walls effected where needed. The latrines have been particularly attended to, and the dry-earth system in general use. There has been no epidemic visitation of disease in any of the hospitals of the division during the year. 1st Regiment M.A.I. This corps arrived in Thayetmyo from Kamptee in January and February 1872. Assistant Surgeon W. Robertson, who was in medical charge during the year, reports as follows:BRITISH BURMAH DIVISION. 125 Diet. 126 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF MADRAS. There has been very little sickness amongst the officers. The severest illness was that of Assistant Surgeon Hanks, who was thrown from his pony on 24th ultimo and sustained concussion of the brain, rendering him still, 10th January, unfit to complete this report. 10th Regiment M.A.I.

The disease prevailed in Rangoon for several weeks before it appeared here. The character of the disease varied considerably. In a few cases the fever, head-ache, pains in the limbs, and rash appeared almost at the outset, and these cases were of short duration. In other instances the rash did not appear till the sixth day and lingered on for a few days. These cases were not severe. In some the prostration pains in the limbs, fever, and especially head-ache, were very severe when delirium seemed to be imminent. I have seen but one death, a Eurasian child, who died of delirium and coma probably from want of proper attention at first. Cases such as the above I have seen amongst the civil population. In the detachment out of a strength of 120 men there were 77 admissions from dengue. The symptoms were fever of a continued form, pains over the whole body, particularly severe in the small joints of the hands awl feet, in the loins and head. The conjunctivæ were red, with pains in the eye-balls. The fever and severe symptoms lasted from one to three days, according as the case was mild or severe; in some no rash was visible; in those in whom it did appear was slight, and generally came on about the third day. The pains in the small joints lasted generally from ten to fifteen days, when the men were fit for duty. There was no death, and the cases were on the whole not severe. The last admission was on the 29th August. The Right Wing, 39th Regiment, Native Infantry, arrived at this station on the 27th August. They were accom- modated in barracks close to the men of the 27th Regiment, Native Infantry, but no cases of dengue occurred amongst them. None of the officers or their families got the disease, though many of their servants suffered from it. It is considered that the disease was milder here than at any other station in Burmah.

The well was closed and cleaned out, after which there was a marked decrease in admis- sions for this disease. During the prevalence of small-pox in the station, six cases occurred among the followers of this regiment, but no death. Dysentery was rather prevalent among the families and followers during the rains. There have been nine casualties, viz., one under each of the following heads:137 SAUGOR CIRCLE. the sandals or boots suffices to heal up the slight sores. When on the march the men all wore sandals, and, as a rule, on a long march they took them off and carried them in their hands. It always seemed to me they got on better without them.
