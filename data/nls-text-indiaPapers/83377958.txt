ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1876. BY J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department. Calcutta: PRINTED AT THE BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1877.
No. 569. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 16th July 1877. SIR, 1. Dullunda. 5. Moydapore. 2. Dacca. 6. Berhampore. 3. Patna. 7. Hazareebagh. 4. Cuttack. 8. Bhowanipore. I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor, my report on the Lunatic Asylums situated in this Province for the year 1876. These asylums are shown in the margin, and it will be perceived that they have remained unchanged with this exception, that an additional one has been opened at Hazareebagh, by means of which the overcrowded condition of some of the other institutions has been relieved. The question of overcrowding will be more fully entered into in paragraph 16. Superintendence. 2. The superintendence of the asylums, with the exception of the one at Dacca, has been in the hands of the same medical officers as in 1875; and Surgeon E. A. Birch, Civil Surgeon of Hazareebagh, is the Superintendent of the new asylum at that station. Sanction for the opening of the Hazareebagh Asylum. 3. Sanction for the new asylum at Hazareebagh was conveyed in Bengal Government letter No. 1449, of 12th April, and detailed instructions were also issued to Superintendents regarding the class of lunatics to be henceforth received and maintained in asylums. The transfer of 155 lunatics to Hazareebagh was also directed (by Government letter No. 1843, of 12th May 1876, to the Inspector-General of Jails) under the following restrictions, viz. that those transferred were not to be violent, dangerous, or sickly; and that.as far as possible, natives of the Behar or West Bengal districts should be selected. For a full account of the new asylum at Hazareebagh, I would refer to the summary compiled from Surgeon Birch's clear and comprehensive report, which will be found further on. Transfer of lunatics from Dacca to Tezpore. Sum to be paid for the support of Assam lunatics. Orders were conveyed (in Bengal Government letter, No. 1854, of 13th May) relative to the transfer generally of lunatics belonging to the Province of Assam from the Dacca to the Tezpore Provincial Asylum; and Bengal Government letter, No. 3182T, of 5th November 1876, to the Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Assam, fixed the sum to be paid yearly for each lunatic from Assam who might still be maintained in the Dacca Asylum at Rs. 90. Plan of the report. 4. Similarly as in last year's report, I have had summaries prepared from the reports received from the several Asylum Superintendents; and on them I shall offer such remarks, or shall draw attention to any statement contained in them, as may assist in explaining the working of the institutions during the past year. I have also retained most of the statistical tables that have been used in former years for the elucidation of the subject of this report, in connection with the asylums taken separately; but in the Appendix will be found the statistics of all institutions compiled in those tables that were ordered by the Government of India in Home Department Resolution, No. 419F, of the 31st August 1874. I shall take up the subjects to be reported on in the order in which they are given in the statistical tables of the Appendix. Admissions, discharges, &c., during 1876 and ten previous years. 5. Statement No. 1 exhibits the principal statistical events of each asylum during the year 1876, while Table No. I in the Appendix supplies similar information regarding all the institutions taken collectively, both for the same year as well as for each one of the preceding decennial period. The statistics of the Bhowanipore Asylum for Europeans are not included in any of the statements or tables, because hitherto it has always been customary to omit them. Owing to the transfer of patients during the year, I must observe (as I did in the report for 1875) that the totals of columns 6 and 7E, in Statement No. 1, (the former representing the total population, the latter the total discharged) are not sums of the subsi- diary figures. The figures denoting the numbers transferred are properly included in the total population of individual asylums; but if included in the general total, they would vitiate the return of 1876, when viewed in comparison with those of other years.

Overcrowding. believe that the proportion of insanes in the population of Bengal has increased, though I expect that if each district had to provide in whole or part for the maintenance of its lunatics in the several asylums, these institutions would in time contain those only who would be legitimate objects for the charity of Government. 16. Calculated at 50 superficial feet per inmate, it appears that the asylums can accom- modate (males 1,180, females 283) 1,463 lunatics ; so that, by proper distribution, there should be no overcrowding of either males or females. This is shown in Statement No. 4, as well as the maximum number confined on any one night, and the average amount of overcrowding in each asylum during the year. STATEMENT No. 4. ASYLUMS.

The daily average strength of the criminal lunatics was (males 222.31, females 25.30) 247.61, and they consequently formed (males 22.76, females 10.20) 20.22 per cent. of the total mean strength of the asylum population. Their death-rate for the year was (males 8.99, females 11.85) 9.28 per cent. of average strength. Proportion of criminal lunatics in the several asylums. 21. Taking the asylums separately, it has been ascertained that the class of criminal lunatics formed nearly one-fourth of the average daily strength of the Dullunda Asylum. In the Dacca Asylum there were 33.24 per cent. of them. In the Patna Asylum there were nearly 22 per cent. of criminal lunatics. In the Cuttack Asylum they formed upwards of one-fifth of the mean population. In the Moydapore and in the Berhampore Asylums criminal lunatics formed 23.44 per cent. and 20.07 per cent. respectively of the mean population. No criminals were in the Hazareebagh Asylum. The disposal of criminal lunatics is an important question. 22. The disposal of criminal lunatics is an important question, and one which it is unnecessary to discuss in the present report; but the fact may again be repeated that their presence in the asylums has long been considered as a cause of great embarrassment, if not one of permanent danger. It is now generally acknowledged that a person who has com- mitted murder and has been acquitted on the ground of insanity should never on any account be liberated, because, even though the criminal lunatic may have long-lucid intervals, it is impossible to say whether the homicidal tendency has been so completely got rid of that he may be liberated with safety either to the public or himself. Our asylums, considering the large proportion of criminal lunatics they contain (as will be gathered from the preceding paragraph), have been singularly free from reports of life being taken or injuries inflicted by these irresponsible agents; and it is difficult to explain satisfactorily why this should be the case. In England, those murderers who have been acquitted through the plea of insanity never form part of the general asylum population ; on the contrary, they are confined in a special institution at Broadmoor, where, quoting from Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence, 8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. order of frequency, from Calcutta, the 24-Pergunnahs, Serampore, Midnapore, Burdwan, Howrah, &c.; into the Dacca Asylum, from Dacca, Sylhet, Chittagong, Tipperah, Mymensingh, &c.; into the Patna Asylum, from Shahabad, Patna, Monghyr, Gya, Sonthal Pergunnahs, Tirhoot, &c.; into the Cuttack Asylum, from Cuttack, Balasore, Pooree, LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 Rate of admissions and of daily average sick. 31.

Sickness in the Dullunda Asylum. It can readily be ascertained from the preceding table, and from the separate asylum reports, that the following diseases, in order of frequency, formed the greatest proportion of the total admissions into hospital, viz. in the Dullunda Asylum these were among the male patients dysentery, fevers, diseases of the nervous system, phthisis, and cholera, and they formed 68.38 per cent. of the total admissions. Among the females, brain diseases, cholera, dysen- tery, fevers, and phthisis, were the most prevalent diseases, and they formed 63.86 per cent. of the total admissions of the sex. Dacca Asylum.

The average cost of each patient for the year was Rs. 97-0-3, against Rs. 102-15-9 in 1875; and varied from Rs. 49-8-1 in the Hazareebagh Asylum to Rs. 110-5-6 and Rs. 142-2-10 in the Dacca and Dullunda Asylums respectively. Cost of establishment. 46. In regard to establishment, the expenditure varied from Rs. 22-13-10 at Hazaree- bagh to Rs. 70-3-0 at Dullunda. The Superintendent of the Berhampore Asylum offers an explanation regarding his increased expenditure under this heading, which will be found in paragraph 16 of the report on that institution. Cost of diet. 47. The cost of diet per patient varied from Rs. 16-4-9 at Hazareebagh to Rs. 54-3-7 at Dacca and Rs. 55-3-10 at Dullunda. The increase in the diet charge at Dullunda is reported to have been caused by strengthening extras having been given freely to those employed on heavy labour. Cost of bazar medicines. 48. The expenditure per patient on account of bazar medicines varied from 8 pie at Moydapore to Re 0-4-5 at Dacca and Re. 0-4-9 at Hazareebagh. Contingencies. 49. Under the head of contingencies, the cost per patient varied from Re. 0-14-5 at Moydapore to Rs. 12-8-9 at Dullunda. In the Hazareebagh Asylum the sum shown under the head of contingencies is reported to have been on account of purchases which will not recur, and which were necessitated by the opening of a new asylum. Clothing. 50. The expenditure on account of each patient for clothing varied from Rs. 3-1-6 at Cuttack to Rs. 6-3-1 at Patna. As each lunatic in the Patna Asylum was provided with a warm blanket jacket for winter use (vide paragraph 17 of the report of that asylum), perhaps the increased outlay under this heading may be thus accounted for. Establishment. 51. Table No. X of the Appendix shows the establishment of each asylum in detail, and calls for no special remark from me. The conduct and attention to their duties of the subordinate asylum officers (with the exception of some of those of the Dacca institution) have been generally reported on favourably. I refrain from making special allusion here to the system of peculation that was detected as having been systematically carried on in one of the asylums, and that, too, by subordinates whose names, I regret to say (accepting the correctness of the laudatory reports made of them), were brought favourably to notice by me last year. But I am sanguine that the disclosure of the iniquitous system will put medical officers henceforth on their mettle, and secure such an amount of close and intelligent supervision as will render repetition of such practices impossible. Manufactures. 52. Table No. XI in the Appendix shows the receipts and expenditure on account of manufactures in each ayslum during the past year. Out of a daily average population of 1,224.43, 886.81 were employed on work of some kind or other. A sum of Rs. 24,729-13-4 was received during the year for articles sold, and manufactured goods to the amount of Rs. 12,713-14-4 were made over for asylum purposes. The total profits from the Manufacture Department were Rs. 8,177-5-6, but were less than those returned in 1875 by Rs. 3,345-9-2. The profits in the Dullunda, Dacca, Patna, and Moydapore Asylums have decreased by Rs. 2,614, Rs 1,076, Rs. 280, and Rs. 29 respectively ; while there has been an increase
14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. in the Cuttack and Berhampore Asylums of Rs. 38 and Rs. 575. Explanations as to the apparent decrease in the profits from the Manufacture Departments will be found in the reports of the Dullunda (paragraph 19), Patna (paragraph 17), and Moydapore (paragraph 15) Asylums. Conclusion. 53. In conclusion, I consider the results of the year, whether considered with reference to the care and treatment of the insane patients, or to the statistics of sickness and mortality, to have been, on the whole, very satisfactory, and to afford ample evidence of the ability and humanity with which the Superintendents of the various asylums have performed this impor- tant and responsible part of their public duties. DULLUNDA ASYLUM REMARKS ON THE SEVERAL ASYLUMS. Superintendence. 1. Dullunda.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 Criminal lunatics. 9. On the 1st of January there was a population of (males 54, females 4) 58 criminal lunatics, who thus formed (males 22.13, females 6.34) 18.89 per cent. of the total number of patients in the asylum on that date. During the year (males 33, females 2) 35 were admitted, and 1 male was re-admitted; so that the total population of this class was (males 88, females 6) 94. From this number (males 8, female 1) 9 were discharged and transferred, 12 males were transferred to Berhampore Asylum, 2 males escaped, and 4 males died. On the 31st of December (males 62, females 5) 67 of this class were remaining in the asylum, which shows an increase of (males 8, female 1) 9 on the number present at the commencement of the year. Average strength of criminal lunatics. 10. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics was (males 63.55, females 4.59) 68.14, and formed (males 29.14, females 6.32) 23.44 per cent., or nearly one-fourth of the daily average strength of the asylum during the year. Sickness. 11. The total number of patients admitted into hospital during the year was (males 117, females 36) 153, or at the rate of (males 53.65, females 49.62) 52.64 per cent. of mean strength. The daily average number of sick was (males 7.63, females 2.42) 10.05, or at the rate per cent. of average strength of (males 3.49, females 3.33) 3.45, and was nearly the same in the case of the male patients as in 1875, but was lower in the case of the females by 1.01 per cent. Diseases which caused the greatest number of admissions into hospital. 12. Those diseases which caused the largest number of admissions into hospital, as well as their proportion to the total admissions, are shown in the following table; the admis- sions according to sex are shown separately16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. also noticed that the place seemed almost free from dysentery and diarrhLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 17 The restoration of the large labour shed was undertaken. The largest was finished, and good progress had been made with the second before the close of the year. The apparatus for a shower-bath, which should serve for the ablution of the entire number of women, was also completed, and has been found to work in a very satisfactory manner. It will be my endeavour shortly to introduce a similar contrivance for the male population.18 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Admissions and re-admissions. 4. During the year there were (males 55, females 6) 61 admissions, and four males were re-admitted, making a total of (males 59, females 6) 65. This number was considerably lower than that of the average of the preceding quinquennial period, or of any year in it, and was most probably due to the observance of the orders of Government regarding the admis- sion of new patients, as well as to the opening of an asylum at Tezpore in the early part of the year, into which institution many insanes would be admitted who formerly were sent to Dacca. Total population. 5. The total population, according to the figures in paragraphs 1 and 2, was thus (males 252, females 50) 302, and was (males 13, females 10) 23 below that of the average of the preceding decennial period, or of any year in it with the exception of 1867 and 1871.

This number, although less by five than what it was on the corresponding date of 1875, was (males 14, females 4.7) 18.7 in excess of the average number 20 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Fevers.

The increase in licenses is said to be nominal. The number open has never exceeded 107. The increase in consumption is owing to one large dealer having dropped the price in order to sell more. The other dealers were forced to follow his example, and hence the increased consumption. Occupations. 23. No change of importance, the superintendent states, was made in the occupations engaged in by the lunatics, and they were conducted in much the same way as in former years. The different kinds of employments were carpentering and cane-work, gardening, the manufacture of mustard and castor oils, the manufacture of soorkee, water-carrying, baking, conservancy work, &c., &c. The females were principally employed in grinding wheat, spinning thread, and making soorkee. The hours for labour were from 7 to 11 A.M. and from 2 to 5 P.M. Amusements. 24. It is reported that the lunatics are treated once or twice a month to a nautch given at the expense of Nawab Khajeh Ahsanullah, and that they enjoy the entertainment thoroughly, and conduct themselves well. Water-supply. 25. The water used in the asylum is brought from the river in carts, and is at once treated with alum (six grains to the gallon), and allowed to stand for a time, when it is filtered. An abundant supply is kept, and the lunatics are allowed to drink of it only. The super- intendent reports that Government sanction has been received for the extension of the new water-supply of Dacca to the asylum, and that there are to be two fountains in the asylum22 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Mr. Brock, who was appointed overseer of the asylum, vice Camelleri, was found guilt of criminal breach of trust, for which he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100. This sentence was, however, not upheld by the Sessions Court, and Mr. Brock was acquitted. On the 22nd December a special meeting of the visitors was convened in order to decide whether Mr. Brock should be restored to his appointment or dismissed. It was decided by four votes against two, the Superintendent states, that Mr. Brock should be discharged, and this decision was duly carried out. Mr. Brock appealed against this decision, and up to the end of the year no one had been appointed to succeed him. Remarks by the Deputy Surgeon- General. 31. The asylum was visited by Mr. Adley, Officiating Deputy Surgeon-General of the Dacca Circle, on the 28th November 1876. The following is a copy of his remarks entered in the visitors' book:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 23 urgently needed to diminish the steadily growing population of the asylum ; for although the number confined on the 31st December 1875 was slightly less than that of 1874, the decrease in the former year was owing to the transfer of patients to Berhampore. If such a timely transfer had not been effected, Dr. Simpson considers that the asylum population would now doubtless be nearly 300. Discharged 24 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. There is a very general agreement between the statements contained in paragraphs 11, 12, and 13, and those recorded in previous years. Sickness and mortality. 14. The total number treated in hospital during the year was (males 73, females 16) 89, or at the rate of (males 43.80, females 26.66) 39.27 per cent. of mean strength. The daily average number of sick was (males 15.71, females 4.48) 20.19, or at the rate of (males 9.42, females 7.46) 8.90 per cent. of mean strength; and the mortality was at the rate of (males 6.60, females 8.33) 7.06 per cent. of mean strength. The sick rate was less than that in either 1875 or 1874, and the mortality (calculated on mean strength), though slightly higher than it was in 1875, was less by nearly 4 per cent. than the average of the preceding decennial period. The following table exhibits the principal causes of sickness and mortality amongst the male and female insane patients respectively, as well as the proportion which each contributed to the general total:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 25 castor seeds preparatory to crushing in the mills, and all the wheat for the consumption of the insanes was ground by them. Garden work afforded employment for a good number of the insanes. It is shown that the amount realized by the sale of manufactures was Rs. 5,167-12-3, against Rs. 5,026-10 in 1875. Dr. Simpson also states in his report that 26 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. such insanes as are unmanageable outside, or dangerous or uncertain in their behaviour. So also the friends and relatives of insanes able to provide for them endeavour to get them out of the asylum, for so long as they are confined they lose position in caste.

Criminal lunatics formed 20.51 per cent. of the total mean asylum population. Caste and home of those admitted. 14. Taken according to caste, Hindoos formed 95.2 and Mahomedans 4.8 per cent. of the admissions during the year. According to districts, 71.43 per cent. of those admitted came from Cuttack, Pooree, and Balasore, and the remainder were from Agra, Sumbulpore, Sing- bhoom, and Arrah. The homes of two lunatics were unknown. Occupation and age. 15. According to occupation, the patients admitted had been coolies, beggars, shop- keepers, goldsmiths, cultivators, of 28 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Inspection. 23. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle inspected this asylum on the 2nd of December 1876. The following extract has been taken from his report, viz.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 29 Criminal lunatics. Average strength. Mortality. 11. There remained in the asylum on the 1st January (males 13, females 2) 15 criminal lunatics, and none of this class were admitted during the year. Of this number (male 1, female 1) two were released at the recommendation of the visitors and by order of Government, and two males died, leaving at the end of the year a residual population of (males 10, female 1) 11. The daily average strength during the year was (males 11.06, females 1.5) 12.56, so that criminal lunatics formed (males 27.35, females 11.40) 23.44 per cent of the average total asylum population during the year. The mortality (2 males) was at the rate of 18.08 per cent. Types of insanity. Causes of insanity. 12. Of the total number of insane patients, it appears that (males 25, females 26.66) 25.42 per cent. were suffering from acute maina; (males 40.90, females 66.66) 47.45 per cent. from chronic mania ; (males 22.72, females 0.00) 16.94 per cent. from chronic dementia; and (males 11.36, females 6.66) 10.16 per cent. were not insane. As upwards of 60 per cent. of the lunatics (male and female) were suffering from the more chronic forms of mania and dementia, the small proportion of those discharged cured is hardly to be wondered at. Among the physical causes of madness, as observed in this asylum, ganja, as in every other similar institution, stands pre-eminent. Next in order of frequency came hereditary influence, fever, spirits, and opium. Of the moral causes, grief is almost the sole and principal one. Expenditure and cost per patient. 13. The expenditure during the year was Rs. 4,200-3-3, and this sum was composed of the following items: - Per Patient. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P. Establishment ... ... ... ... ... ... 2,151 14 1 40 2 4 Diet ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,795 8 1 33 7 7 Clothing ... ... ... ... ... 202 5 9 3 12 3 Bazar medicines ... ... ... ... 2 1 0 0 0 7 Contingencies ... ... ... ... ... 48 6 4 0 14 5 Total ... 4,200 3 3 78 5 2 Annual cost per patient. 14. The annual cost of each patient was Rs. 78-5-2, against Rs. 69 2-7 in 1875, thus showing an excess of Rs. 9-2-7. In explanation of this the Superintendent writes as follows:30 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Admissions, &c. males. There were (males 27, females 8) 35 admissions, 3 (males) re-admissions, and 38 (males) received by transfer; so that the total asylum population was (males 241, females 62) 303. Received by transfer. 4. Of the 38 male patients received by transfer, 12 were received from the Dullunda Asylum, 11 were sent back from the Hazareebagh Asylum, and 15 were received from the Dacca Asylum. Discharged cured.

From the total population enumerated in paragraph 3, (males 10, females 2) 12 were discharged cured, or at the rate of (males 8.04, females 3.46) 6.59 per cent of mean strength; 8 males were made over to their friends in an improved condition; one female was made over to her friends not improved; 95 males were transferred to Hazareebagh ; 5 males were discharged otherwise; and 10 males died. Deducting the preceding numbers from the total population, it will be found that the residual asylum population was (males 113, females 59) 172, or less than that shown as remaining on the 1st of January by 60 males, with an increase of the female patients by 5.

It will be remarked that the most fatal diseases amongst the male insanes were apoplexy, anæmia, cholera, dropsy, dysentery, and diarrh32 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. upon which this sum has been expended were (1st) the making of drains to enable the male wards to be thoroughly washed, Rs. 68-12 ; (2nd) raising a workshed in the male ward, Rs. 120 ; (3rd) purchasing office furniture, Rs. 168 ; and (4th) for purchasing copper cooking utensils, Rs. 250. It was found that a considerable monthly charge was incurred for renew- ing the earthen cooking pots which had boon previously in use, and which were constantly being broken ; and it was considered wiser to incur a proportionately large expense, once for all, in providing copper vessels, capable of resisting for some years the wear and tear of constant use in a lunatic asylum.

He joined his post on the 19th of March. Transfer of insanes delayed by cholera. 4. 34 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Sickness and mortality. 13. Since the asylum was opened there were 181 admissions into hospital, or at the rate of 88.72 per cent. of mean strength. Of these 18 patients died, or at the rate of 8.82 per cent. of mean strength and 9.94 per cent of total treated. The daily average number sick was 22.1, or at the rate of 10.83 per cent. of mean strength. Mr. Birch offers the following explanation regarding the high rate of sickness:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 35 windows in the rear, to make them more cheerful and better ventilated; others to have asphalte floors for filthy or violent patients, an arrangement the utility and convenience of which cannot be doubted, while the means of treatment according to modern ideas will be augmented. Windows and doors. Single kutcha rooms. 18. 36 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Employment. 26. The daily average number of insanes employed since the asylum opened was 31.3, but there has been a progressive improvement in this respect. The insanes have found chief occupation in gardening work, ornamentation of the grounds, and cleaning. Some have also been employed in the cook-house, assisting in hospital, at jute spinning, tailoring, weeding, water-carrying, &c. Expenditure. 27. The total expenditure since the opening of the asylum has been Rs. 10,119-13-8, or at the rate per patient of Rs. 49-9-8. The following were the several items of expenditure :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 37 BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM. 1. Bhowanipore.38 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Charge on account of establishment. " The increased charge per patient for establishment is apparent, not real. The Euro- pean overseer had been wanting during a great part of 1875, and his absence led to the reduction of expense. " The diet charge is due to the inclusion in one item of the cost of diet of all classes. The additional payment by first-class patients has required some little freedom in table indul- gences which before might be reasonably refused, and the cost appears in this place as distributed in an average over the whole body of inmates." Deputy Superintendent and Matron. 8. In reporting on the high character and service of the Deputy Superintendent and Matron (Mr. and Mrs. DeVere), Dr. Payne remarks that" it is difficult to vary the language of eulogy from year to year. If it were possible to add anything to what I have said in former years of them both, I would gladly do so. Their standard of what is due from them is simply to do the best they can do for every person committed to their care, and with kind hearts and ready hands to smooth away discomforts. It is not surprising that every one who leaves the place in a condition to express himself is filled with gratitude to Mr. and Mrs DeVere, and unmindful of the many inconveniences of a place so ill provided as this with the requirements of a modern asylum." Remarks by the Deputy Surgeon- General. 9. The Deputy Surgeon-General, when forwarding Dr. Payne's reports to the Surgeon- General's Office, writes as follows :APPENDIX.

Of the 26 bonâ-fide re-admissions 13 were cases of recurrent insanity, chiefly due to intoxication, received in the Dullunda Asylum. It may be questioned if a sufficiently strict adherence to the instructions of Government would not have led the Magistrates who passed the orders of admission in some of these cases to dispose otherwise of the insane persons in question. 3. The following table exhibits the capacity of each of the native lunatic asylums, allowing 50 superficial feet to each patient, and the number of lunatics confined in each on the last day of the year:( 3 ) dementia. There were no recoveries from idiocy or amentia. The proportion of complete cures was 10.61 per cent. of average strength, 8.58 per cent. of cases treated, and 35.51 per cent of admissions. The proportion of recoveries, partial and total, was 17.14 per cent of average strength, 13.86 per cent. of the total treated, and 57.36 per cent. of admissions. These results are much less favourable than those of the previous year, which gave 28.23, 21.31, and 76.07 per cent. respectively, and were also considerably below the average of the preceding quinqueninal period. The various fluctuations will be noticed in the special remarks on the different asylums. No general explanation of the decrease is offered, but it is doubtless in some degree attributable to the more careful selection of lunatics for admission during a part of the year; and from this point of view it may be expected that the results of the current year will also appear less successful than those of 1875 and the year immediately preceding it. Dr. Beatson points out that even last year's results compare favourably with the statistics of the public asylums of Middlesex and Surrey for the ten years ending in 1874. It appears that in these institutions the average proportion of cures was 7.56 per cent. of average strength, 22.95 per cent. of cases treated, and 30.51 per cent. of admissions. The comparison is interesting, but it does not appear to be of any practical value. The mass of the population of England, and especially of the metro- politan districts, is exposed to very different mental conditions from those which are produced by the every-day life of the native of Bengal. The stimulus to mental activity is greater and more sustained, and the strain on the faculties is more severe. It is only natural, therefore, that in the former case lunacy would assume more complex and less tractable forms than in the latter. The only useful basis of comparison is to be found in the results of different asylums in Bengal, and in the results of the same asylums in different years. Viewed according to these tests, the results of the year exhibit a wide and imperfectly explained divergence in the degree of success attained. 6. There were 1,152 admissions into hospital, or 94 per cent. of average daily strength, against a proportion of 102.4 per cent in 1875. The average daily number of sick was 8.02 per cent. of mean strength, against 7.48 in the previous year. The admissions into hospital were exceptionally numerous in Dacca and Moydapore, where they numbered 250 and 230 per cent. of males and 103 and 235 per cent. of females respectively. In Dacca the daily average proportion of sick to mean strength was 17.49 per cent. of males and 12.54 per cent. of females; in Patna it was 9.42 and 7.46 respectively; and in Hazaree- bagh, where only males were conf1ned, it was 10.83. In Dullunda and Berhampore the rates were, for males 53.6 and 55.48 admissions and 3.49 and 2.47 daily average sick per cent. of mean strength, and for females 49.6 and 3.3 and 65.9 and 1.9 respectively. It is clear therefore, after every allowance is made for the mental and inferior physical condition of insane patients, that there must be some special conditions affecting the health of the lunatics in Dacca, Moydapore, and Hazareebagh. This point will be adverted to further on. It seems highly probable that the great frequency of diarrh( 4 ) 7.

A new asylum building has been designed, but its erection has been postponed for financial reasons. The present building is required for amalgamation with the jail. Mr. Eden is not quite satisfied that an asylum is really necessary at Cuttack, now that regular steam communication has been established between False Point and Calcutta. Moydapore.( 7 ) are all criminals, but, on the other hand, all the Bhowanipore patients who are not paupers should be maintained at the cost of their friends; while those who are paupers should be clothed and fed on a more economical scale if possible. The chief item of expenditure, however, is under the head of " establishment." The Lieutenant-Governor is well aware of the earnestness and success with which Dr. Payne manages the institutions under his charge, but desires that his attention may be invited to the possibility of reductions in the scale of expenditure. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice the high terms in which the Deputy Superintendent and Matron of the asylum are spoken of. The report of the Surgeon-General is full and interesting.

SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, my report regarding the Lunatic Asylums of Bengal named in the margin for the year 1877, together with the usual statis- tical tables and abstracts of the reports which have been submitted by the Superintendents of these institutions. Superintendents of asylums. 2. The Superintendents of all the asylums are exactly the same as they were at the date of last report, except in the case of Dacca, which was under the charge of three officers during various periods of the year, viz. Surgeon H. Fullerton, M.B.; Surgeon-Major J. Jones, M.D.; and Surgeon A. Crombie, M.D. Moydapore Asylum was closed, and the patients transferred to Berhampore on the 1st October 1877. The table which follows gives a general view of the results of treatment in the various asylums during the year.

On the 1st January 1876 there remained 906 males and 241 females, or a total of 1,147 ; and on the last day of the year there were 896 males and 235 females, or together 1,131, being a decrease of 16 inmates. This is satis- factory, since for years past there has been a steady annual increase, both of males and females, and, as appears from a table given in Dr. Beatson's report for 1876, the average annual increase of patients between 1868 and 1876 was 63.6. The decrease for 1877 is owing to the stringent orders of Government as promulgated in a letter from Home Department to Government of Bengal, No. 44, dated 25th January 1876. It is, however, necessary to keep in mind that in all asylums the number of permanent inmates, who will only be removed by death, must increase year by year by the accumulation of criminal lunatics who cannot be discharged, and of incurables who are either occasionally violent or dangerous to them- selves or others. Admitted during the year. During the year there were admitted 201 males and 46 females, making a total of 247. The re-admissions amounted to 38, there having been 35 males and three females. During 1876 there were 329 admissions (261 males and 68 females), and 37 re-admissions (32 males and 5 females). Of the re-admis- sions shown against Hazareebagh, 11 are re-captures of escaped male lunatics. Transfers. The following transfers were made, viz. 25 females from Dullunda to Hazareebagh, and one male from Cuttack to Dullunda. Average annual number of inmates. The average annual number of lunatics confined in the asylums of Bengal for the 10 years from 1867 to 1876 has been 1,008 males and 273 females, or together 1,281. During 1877 it was 1,132 males and 284 females, or for both 1,416. Discharges. Discharges.4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. It thus appears that the average number of days that each patient cured was in confinement was 873 for males and 596 for females, and for each patient improved 988 for males and 735 for females. Statistics of the asylums contrast- ed. By means of the table below I contrast the results in all the asylums of Bengal for 1877 with the average of those same asylums for the six years previously:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 51, against 36.8 for the previous 10 years; and during these years there was an average of 17.5 deaths annually, against 15 in 1877. Confinement of criminal with non-criminal lunatics. It is to be regretted that it should be necessary to have criminal confined with non-criminal lunatics in the same asylum. All the best authorities in England and, it may be added, in every other country, are opposed to this practice, to which there are many obvious objections. It will, however, be observed that in every asylum in Bengal last year there were criminals, except at Hazareebagh; and even there, too, since the beginning of the present year, there is one criminal. The modern ideas in reference to the treatment of insanity require that an asylum should be as little prison-like in appearance as possible. But an asylum for criminals ought to be constructed more with reference to the safe custody of the inmates than one for non-criminals. Many criminal lunatics have committed murder when labouring under homicidal mania, and though they get well for a time they are liable to a recurrence of the disease. It is also found that some criminal lunatics are unusually danger- ous and destructive, so that in the British asylums for their detention restraint and seclusion appear to be resorted to in order to tame them down in proportion and manner which would hardly be required for ordinary insane patients. Plans for the custody of criminal lunatics. There are two plans which might be suggested for the custody of the criminal lunatics of Bengal6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Occupations of those admitted. Taking into account the occupations of the cases admitted during the year, cultivators were most numerously represented, these having been 62; next, coolies, 42; beggars, 20; no occupation, 18; servants, 17; and shop- keepers, 11. The table of age indicates that there were 14 cases admitted under 20 ; 209 from 20 to 40; 57 from 40 to 60 ; and five upwards of 60. Types of insanity. An abstract of Table No. VI of the Appendix gives the type of insanity and the results of treatment for the asylums of the whole of Bengal during 1877:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 7 the abstract which follows, while a large number of admissions might be accounted for under the head of " all other diseases." A table of diseases will not be found in the reports of English asylums. The following table shows the admissions from some of the most common Indian diseases, and their relative frequency in the different asylums of Bengal, during 1877 :8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Causes of deaths. The following table gives a comprehensive view of the cause of death in the various asylums :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 it during an outbreak of the disease at that station; and he mentions that the Reverend Mr. McFarlane, a Missionary, used to go about the hill villages administering santonine to all cases reported as cases of cholera, and with excellent effect. Dr. N. Jackson made a similar observation at Balasore in 1866, and this year at Buxar. It seems most probable that these worms are caused by the drinking of foul water, in which the ova of the parasite are contained, and the experience of Surgeon-Major Payne in the Dullunda Asylum, and of Surgeon-Major Birch at Hazareebagh, tend to confirm this opinion, for they find that when they make it impossible for the lunatics to obtain dirty water to drink intestinal worms do not affect them. Dr. Payne has further found that forcing his patients to drink pure water by taking away from them the possibility of using any other has also had a marvellous effect in reducing the number of cases of dysentery and diarrh10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. to be cared for, and thus the average cost for establishment debitable to each patient is greatly enhanced. All the lunatics in Bengal if put into one asylum would not prove too heavy a charge for a single Superintendent with competent assistants, or at all events two Superintendents could very easily look after all the lunatic population of Bengal if it was placed in two asylums. It seems to me that the closing of the small asylum at Cuttack would be advantageousLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 Receipts and expenditure. Table No. XI of the Appendix shows the receipts and expenditure on account of manufactures in each asylum. During 1876, out of a daily average population of 1,224.4, 886.8, or 72.42 per cent., were occupied on some work or other. During 1877 there was a daily average population of 1,117, and 911.9 on an average were occupied each day, or 81.6 per cent. In the following table the profits of manufactures in the years 1876 and 1877 are contrasted:12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. acute forms of insanity, in which recovery is expected in high proportion. Among the acute cases there were 38 recoveries. Transfers. There was only one escape during the year. In the month of July 25 female lunatics were transferred to Hazareebagh. The total number of discharges amounted to 103, and on the last day of the year there were 202 persons in the asylum. General health. 5. The general health of the inmates during the year was extremely good, as will be seen from Table No. VIII, or from the rough abstract given below:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Occupation.

Of these 11, five were, on the recommendation of visitors, discharged and made over to their friends; three were sent to stand their trial, two were transferred to jail, and one escaped. These cases may all be taken as cured of their insanity. Died. Only three criminal lunatics died during the year, all males, in the propor- tion of 12.5 per cent. of the total criminal admissions. In 1876 the number of deaths in the same class was six, and the ratio 23.07 per cent.; in 1875, eight, or 33.33 per cent. of the total criminal admissions. Remained on 31st December. On the 31st December there remained 85 criminal lunatics in the asylum, 74 males and 11 females. The daily average strength of criminal lunatics throughout the year was 79.88 (69.56 males and 10.32 females). Residence of lunatics. 6. As to the residence of the lunatics, the largest number, viz. 21, came from Dacca; next Sylhet, which furnished eight inmates; Mymensing, Cachar, Chittagong, Furreedpore, Goalundo, four each; Tipperah three; besides other places which sent single cases. Caste. 7. In relation to caste, the new admissions were chiefly Hindus, being 68.4 per cent. of the total admissions. Taking the figures for 1877 and those of the census for 1872, we arrive at the following table:16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. months, during the whole of which time he behaved in the most quiet and sober manner, conversed rationally on all subjects, worked hard in the garden and gained weight, and had only a confused recollection of the period he had spent in the asylum in the exalted state I have described. He had been a ganja-smoker and spirit-drinker, and his insanity had lasted only 25 days before his admission. His exaltation continued without abatement till he was taken into the hospital on the 13th March 1877 with the symptoms mentioned, and he was discharged from the asylum on the 31st October 1877 'clothed and in his right mind.'" The greatest number of recoveries and improvements took place among cases of acute mania, and the least among those of chronic dementia. Assigned causes of insanity. 10. Among the assigned causes, ganja was the commonest, and it was also found that the greatest number of recoveries occurred in cases in which the use of this drug was the assigned cause. In two cases the abuse of ardent spirits was given as the cause. The disease was said to have been hereditary in four cases. It is said that the lunatics are put to out-door work, and Dr. Crombie suspects that occasionally when so employed they get ganja from their relatives or friends. Sickness. 11. Sickness.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 17 deleteriously on their mental state. If, for instance, a lunatic approaching cure mischievously, or through vexation or any other such cause, tear up his clothing or wantonly pull up vegetables, he is confined for the rest of the day, and a large proportion of my patients have enough common sense to understand the rationale of the punishment. Such offences are, of course, overlooked in the case of those whose mental condition is such that they cannot control their actions. But I think that the exceptional meting out of mild punishment, under my own special supervision, helps to re-establish in the minds of convalescing lunatics a conception of the proper relation between actions and consequent happiness or the reverse, as cause and effect, and is not an unimportant curative agent. This is the only form of punishment permitted in the asylum, and is always seen to by myself personally. Only three lunatics have been permanently locked up throughout the year. One of these is the epileptic alluded to in last year's report; another is a man who is utterly unmanageable, who, directly his cell door is opened, rushes naked to the gate, where a prolonged scuffle takes place to seize him and drag him back; and the third is a violent, treacherous lunatic, whom it would not be safe to let loose amongst the others. The epileptic is undergoing decided improvement under bromide of potassium. The experiment of allowing more liberty to the epileptic and the second is being tried while this report is being written."

The floor is raised four feet above the ground, and the ventilation is thorough. Since the occupation of the new building, there is now available space for 167 males and 50 females, or 217 lunatics, while the average daily number confined during the year has been only 204.9. It has, however, been impossible to obtain this ample space except for May and June, part of October, and for November and December. "In the end of 1876 a sloping tiled roof covered with terrace cement was put on the new ward, No. 11-2, P. W. B.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 19 compared with Rs. 56-15-9 in 1876; and " the economy in this respect is due to the carefulness and honesty of the native doctor, Bepin Behary Datta." Contingencies amounted to Rs. 609-14-3 (inclusive of the value of articles received from the manufacture department for asylum purposes), as against Rs. 1,128-10-6 in 1876, or at the rate of Rs. 2-15-7 per head as compared with Rs. 5-7-3 in 1876. " The great reduction which obtains in all those headings as compared with former years is no doubt in great part due to the organized system of fraud which was then carried on and only detected last year. " The total cost of each lunatic in 1877 was therefore Rs. 104-5-10 as compared with Rs. 110-5-6¾ in 1876, Rs. 107-2-8 in 1875, and Rs. 108-4-6 in 1874." Manufacture. 17. From the sale proceeds of manufactures during 1877 Rs. 4,929-8 were remitted to the treasury, as compared with Rs. 3,847-6-4 in 1876. Adding together the profit from the manufactures and the amount realized from patients, which makes up Rs. 3,596-5-5, and deducting this sum from the total expenditure, or Rs. 21,149-3-5, we get a balance of Rs. 17,822-14 as the actual loss to Government on account of the asylum during the year, and the average cost of each inmate as Rs. 86-14-11. Taking into account the money received from relatives for the maintenance of patients and the money value of the labour of the inmates, Dr. Crombie calculates that each lunatic on an average contributed Rs. 2-1-11 to the asylum during 1877. He is further of opinion that a " little more pressure than was brought to bear last year on the relatives of the confined lunatics may increase the amount paid by them." Assam lunatics. 18. On the 1st January there were 46 Assam lunatics. During the year 14 were admitted, making a total of 60, of which number two were discharged cured, four died, one escaped, and 53 remained on the 31st December 1877: daily average strength 49.20. These lunatics are chargeable to the Assam administration at the rate of Rs. 90 each per annum. During the year the experiment of boarding out a few of the inmates was tried, the rate being Rs. 5 a month. Dr. Crombie does not approve of this plan. Defalcation of Overseer J. B. Brock. 19. Dr. Crombie gives full datails of the defalcation, trial, deposition from office, reinstatement, absconding, and capture of Overseer J. B. Brock, who was subsequently tried by the High Court in Calcutta, on the 7th August, on a charge of criminal breach of trust, and convicted and sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment. Dr. Crombie adds20 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Visitors. 20. The visitors met eight times during the year, and the asylum was visited during the summer by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who made the following remarks in the visitors' book :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 21 Escapes. 9. During the year there were two escapes of non-criminal lunatics, both of whom were brought back. Payment for maintenance of patients. 10. Regarding the payment for the maintenance of patients, Dr. Simpson writes22 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. CUTTACK ASYLUM. Superintendence. Cuttack.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 23 Causes of insanity. 7. As to the causes of insanity among those admitted, seven cases are attri- buted to ganja, one to epilepsy, one to grief, and in four cases no cause is assigned. Of those admitted, 11 were cases of acute mania. On the 1 st January there remained 46 in the asylum, and 14 were committed, making a total of 60. Of the latter number, 27, or nearly a half, have more or less a ganja history as the exciting cause of their madness. Mr. Stewart on this subject continues as follows : " The consumption of opium and ganja is unfortunately greatly on the increase in Orissa; formerly the practice was chiefly limited to towns, it is now spreading into the mofussil. All classes, whether Brahmins, Mussulmans, or low Hindoos, have taken to the pernicious habit. There are but few grades of society where it is not spreading. The cause of this increase is difficult to determine, as a great many take it by force of evil example and associations, not a few with the vicious desire of increasing and strengthening the sexual appetite; others with the infa- tuation that they are better able to contemplate the deity while in a state of semi-narcotism. Some commence the practice to relieve bodily pain from colic and other diseases. Be the cause what it may, the habit once commenced seems most difficult to break off. I have never known of a case where a man habituated to either opium or ganja had given the practice up entirely." Criminal lunatics. 8. There were 9 criminal lunatics in confinement on 31st December 1877, and of those two have been pronounced sane; "but the previous history of both is such as to preclude the possibility of the committee recommend- ing: them being set at large." Paying patients. 9. There were three paying patients during the year: one a sepoy who has been discharged cured; the other two belonging to families residing in the district. One of the latter has been discharged cured, and the other is still in confinement, though much improved. Regarding paying patients, Mr. Stewart writes24 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. year after year for the purpose of any useful or instructive comparison with the results of other years." YEAR.

Mortality. 7. Four lunatics died during the year, viz. two males and two females ; one man and one woman belonging to the non-criminal, and one man and one woman to the criminal. The number of lunatics who died last year also amounted to four, the deaths were caused by general dropsy and dysentery, two men from the former complaint, and two women from the latter. Criminal lunatics. 8. On the 1st January 1877 there remained in the asylum 10 men and one woman of this class : one man was discharged, and one man and one woman died, leaving a total of eight men on the 31st December 1877. "The man who was discharged cured has been tried for murder, and was acquitted on the ground that he was insane at the time the act was committed. He was re-ad- mitted into the asylum on the 7th August 1872, on his return from Rungpore after his trial and acquittal. He was perfectly sane at the time of his re-admission, and remained so without any interruption up to the 19th of October 1877, on which date he was released and sent to the Magistrate of Rungpore under orders of Government. He was a well-conducted and hard- working man, who assisted in cooking for the inmates of the asylum. He became, however, very ill during the last 12 months of his confinement in the asylum ; and as there was every probability of his dying if kept longer in confinement, and as he had shown no indication whatever of insanity for nearly five years, the visitors strongly recommended his release, in order to give him a chance of recovering from his then feeble state of health. The period of his detention in the asylum since his re-admission was five years two months and 12 days. Of the two inmates of this class who died during the year, the man had been tried for culpable homicide also at Rungpore, and acquitted on the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the act. He was admitted into the ayslum on the 12th February 1872 quite sane, and he died on the 18th May of the year under report; the period, therefore, of his detention in the asylum was five years three months and seven days. The woman, who was deaf and dumb, has been charged with attempting to commit suicide by cutting her throat, but was found to be of unsound mind and incapable of making a defence. She was admitted into the asylum on the 7th June 1870 and died on the 7th of February 1877. She remained insane throughout the six years and eight months she was in the asylum, and was therefore never tried." Finances. 9. Regarding the financial position of the institution, Mr. Shircore writes as follows : " Statement No. X shows the expenditure of the year. It will be seen that the total amount expended on account of the asylum during the year was Rs. 3,844-7-6, against Rs. 4,200-3-3 in 1876, showing a decrease of Rs. 355-11-9. The annual average cost per head was Rs. 85-15-9, against Rs. 78-6-3 in 1876. This difference is not owing to any actual increased expenditure, but chiefly to the decrease in the number of the inmates. Thus, under the head of establish- ment alone, there is a difference of Rs. 4-6-9 from this cause. " The item in which there has really been an increased outlay is that of diet, the average cost of which per head being Rs. 37-11-9, against Rs. 33-8-2 in 1876. The cause of this increase has been explained in my report on the Berhampore Asylum, namely, the high prices of almost every article of food that prevailed throughout the year. With regard to this asylum there was another circumstance which helped to augment the cost under this head. A reference to Table No. VIII will show that among its immates there were five cases of dropsy under treatment. The efficacy of the milk treatment in such cases is well known, and I had to keep some of these patients on milk diet for the greater part of the year. Among them there is one man who to this time appears and remains quite well as long as he is allowed a large quantity of milk daily, but as soon as the milk is stopped the dropsical symp- toms re-appear in him in a few days." " On the other hand, there is a considerable decrease in the item of clothing, the figures under which head being Re. 1-14-5, against Rs. 3-12-5 in 1876." " The item of contingencies shows an increase of 13 annas 10 pie per head, but this increase was not actual. In 1876 the cost of oil for lamps was by an error included in the charges for diet. This has been rectified in the returns d
26 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL, for 1877, and the cost of oil for lamps has been shown under the head of contingencies, which has necessarily increased the amount of that item." " Table No. X shows the strength and cost of the establishment as it stood on the last day of the year. On the transfer of the immates of the asylum, the Superintendent discontinued to draw the allowance he received previous to the transfer. The space for the amount opposite his name is there- fore left blank; and, owing to the reduced number of patients, there was a decrease of one among the male-keepers. With these exceptions there was no change during the year." " Table No. XI shows the receipts and expenditure on account of manu- factures, from which it will be seen that out of a mean population of 44.7, namely 34.59 males and 10.11 females, on an average a total of about 26.67 persons were employed, and that the amount realized from the sale of manufac- tured articles was Rs. 110-8-3, which shows a net profit of Rs. 1.4, the total amount of credits being Rs. 165-8-3, and that of the debits Rs. 164-4-3. These figures show, no doubt, insignificant results; but I must again ask to be remembered that those who are now left in the asylum are, with very few exceptions, worn-out persons, who have been insane for many years, and who are quite incapable, physically and mentally, of doing much work of any kind. The figures shown in this statement are the results of the manufactures only, besides which the lunatics have performed a fair amount of work connected with the asylum, for which no money has been received or credited in the accounts, and the proceeds of which do not appear in any of the returns submitted. " The Moydapore Asylum has a large compound and a garden; and as no gardeners were employed, the work of keeping them in order and of cultivation was entirely done by the insanes. Table No. X, moreover, shows that no bhisty was employed, so that the water-supply of the asylum was also entirely obtained by lunatic labour; nor was there a paid cook employed for the greater part of the year, the cooking being done by two of the criminal inmates who were not insane." Establishment. 10. The Superintendent reports that Darogah Baboo Rajendro Nath Roy, who has been connected with the asylum since 1874, has given satisfaction by the steady way in which he has worked during the year and the kindness with which he treats the lunatics entrusted to his care. Native Doctor Grish Chunder Mookerjee, who was attached to the staff till 12th April 1877, was relieved by the present incumbent, Native Doctor Annoda Churn Dey. It is gratifying to record that Mr. Shircore was perfectly satisfied with the work performed by each of the subordinates who were connected with the asylum establishment during the year under review.

Six of the 21 admissions were criminal lunatics28 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. " The apparent increase in the average cost under the head of establish- ment was entirely due to the decrease in the average strength of the inmates during the year, and not to any actual increased expenditure. It is true that the number of keepers employed and of the lower servants is regulated according to that of the inmates; but the allowance of Superintendent, and the pay of the Overseer, the Native Doctor, the Matron, and some of the upper servants, remain the same, which shows a proportionately higher rate of cost per patient, as the average strength of the inmates becomes lower. Another circumstance slightly helped in showing increased expenditure in the cost of establishment. The Overseer receives an annual increment of Rs. 5 per month, commencing in the month of April of each year. He therefore received Rs. 45 more than he did in the previous year." " The head under which there was an actual increase of expenditure was that of diet, and this was entirely due to the high prices that prevailed almost throughout the year. Rice, dall, and other articles of food, were all much dearer in 1877 than in 1876. In ordinary years the kind of rice used for the inmates of the asylum is obtainable in the local markets from Re. 1-12 to Rs. 2 per maund; whereas during the year under report the price of it went up for a time as high as Rs. 4 per maund. Similarly, flour, dall, &c., cost considerably more than in other years." " There is one item included in this Table (No. IX) for the year under report which appears for the first time In the accounts of the asylum, viz. diet and passage-money paid to released lunatics. Formerly when a lunatic was discharged from the asylum he was sent to the Magistrate of the district, who used to defray the necessary expenses of sending him to his home. The Accountant-General of Bengal, however, has raised an objection to this arrangement, and insists on the charge being met by the Medical Department. The sum of Rs. 492 was accordingly expended under this head during the year, which adds the sum of 4 annas 9 pie to the average cost per patient." Occupation of inmates. 11. The occupations of the inmates were various, viz. oil-making, weaving, spinning, grinding grain, gardening, &c.; and out of a mean popula- tion of males 108.41, females 57.86, total 166.27, an average of 98.26 males and 45.49 females, making a total of 143-75 lunatics, were employed in various kinds of industry. Manufacture Department. 12. " The sum expended in the purchase of raw materials for manufac- ture department, including all their charges connected with it, amounted to Rs. 3,042-9-10, and that realized from the sale of manufactured goods was Rs. 4,419-3-8, which, with the value of unsold manufactured articles and raw material in store, shows a profit of Rs. 1,583-3-5, against a net profit of Rs. 1,330-5-3 in 1876." Establishment. 13. Mr. Shircore says that the conduct of Overseer Mohendra Nath Roy continues to give him satisfaction in the honest discharge of his duties. In former reports he had expressed himself fully regarding his intelligence, integrity, and special capabilities for his post, and the experience of another year confirms this good opinion. The conduct of Mrs. Sandys, the Matron, has always been satisfactory. She is attentive to her duties, takes an interest in her work, and is kind to her patients. Native Doctor Rutoo is well spoken of, having been attached to the Moy- dapore Dispensary for 29 years, and has been attached to the Berhampore Asylum since its opening in 1874. He is well acquainted with all the details of duty, and his willingness to help in the general management of the lunatics renders him a useful officer. The jemadars and keepers are also commended for their good conduct. Ventilation of wards. 14. During the year the ventilation of the male wards has been greatly improved, and light and air have been admitted into the larger hall or passage between the two lines of cells in the female wards, and Mr. Shircore concludes his report in these words: "Suggestion.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 29 " It only remains now to mention that on the occasion of the Lieutenant- Governor's visit to this station in August last, His Honor, on learning that there was sufficient room in this asylum to accommodate its inmates as well as those of the Moydapore Asylum, ordered the Moydapore patients to be brought and kept here. They (31 males and nine females) were accordingly removed towards the end of the year. " In passing this order it was not the intention of the Lieutenant-Governor that Moydapore Asylum should be closed altogether, but that, so long as there was sufficient room in the Berhampore Asylum for the inmates of both, they should be kept together here, and that the asylum is capable of accommodating, Moydanore is to be re-opened."

Hazareebagh.30 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. whole of the rains a blanket coat is in use, and we are obliged to issue dosooti jackets, whereas in a warmer locality eksooti would answer every purpose." Regarding establishment, Mr. Birch writesLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 31 " But in addition to this a very large quantity of milk has been consumed by the patients, aggregating for the year 276 maunds, being at the rate of 2.18 chittacks for each individual per day. We use 7.1 oz. of vegetables daily per man, against 4oz. used in the jail dietary. We give a chittack less of rice and half a chittack more of dall to the insanes than the prisoners get, more salt and milk as above stated. I contemplate adding 1½ chittacks of dahi per diem to the dietary above quoted and stopping the issue of milk as an extra, save to those who are in hospital. I think then we shall have a tolerably perfect diet, viewed either as to its alimentary principles or as to the practical point of its being agreeable, and satisfying the natural instincts of the appetite. " The question of diet is one of the most important which the Superintend- ent of an institution for the care of natives has to concern himself with, and it is one of the most difficult to manage, for the system of ' peculation by subor- dinates ' to which the Bengal Government calls attention in its resolution upon the asylum report for 1876 is concentrated upon the cook-house, and thereby, notwithstanding all our care, even now I am sure the lunatics are sometimes ' unscrupulously deprived of their proper allowance of food.' I know of no way of preventing this other than by constructing a cook-house, as the Deputy Surgeon-General has recommended, within which the cooks are to be locked during working hours. The present unsightly, large, kutcha cook-house, open at all sides, affords every facility for peculation ; nor do heavy fines, dismissal, or legal prosecution check it." Overcrowding. 9. There has been no overcrowding. The maximum number confined has been 223 males and 25 females. There were only 10 admissions during the year, viz. .five ordered by the Magistrate of Hazareebagh, four by the Magistrate of Lohardugga, and one by the Magistrate of Manbhoom. " It would seem," remarks Mr. Birch, " that insanity does not prevail in this region." Percentage of cures. 10. The percentage of cures has been 8.04 of males, calculated on the average strength. This seems a highly satisfactory result, when it is considered that nearly all the inmates of the asylum have been cases of chronic insanity. Escapes. 11. There were 13 escapes during the year. Most of these were speedily recaptured, but one man was absent for 10 months and another has not yet been retaken. There is nothing but an aloe hedge and deep ditch to prevent lunatics getting away. Doubtless the keepers will, by experience, become more watchful and more careful. Death-rate. 12. The death-rate, calculated on the mean strength, was 5.20 for males, and no females died ; so that the mortality for the two sexes was at the rate of 4.95 per cent. Mr. Birch attributes this low mortality to the comparative coolness of the climate, to the fact of the patients being allowed milk and meat as part of the diet, and to the large quantity of vegetables allowed ; to the men being taken into hospital before they actually manifest bodily sickness; and " certainly not least because of the assiduity with which the Overseer has worked for the welfare of those under his charge, and the painstaking way the Native Doctor has performed his important part of the duties." Sickness. 13. The daily average number of sick was 21.77 (20.23 males and 1.54 females), or 9.8 per cent. of strength. This, as Mr. Birch remarks, is a high figure, though it does not indicate any sanitary defects, but is the result of the system followed of admitting into hospital the most trivial cases of indis- position. Criminal lunatics. 14. When the asylum was instituted it was ordered by Government that no criminal lunatics should be sent to it. However, under a recent notice (No. 3657, of 4th August 1877) a man was sent from the central jail. It is hoped that this is an exceptional instance, as the asylum at Hazareebagh is insecure and unsuitable for the reception of criminal lunatics. Intestinal worms. 15. Mr. Birch alludes to the presence of intestinal worms as giving rise to diarrh32 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Finances. 16. The following quotation from Mr. Birch's report is given in regard to financial Table No. IX : " Table No. IX correctly shows the whole of the receipts and disbursements which occurred in 1877; but I would beg to point out that it includes under some headings payments for a period of 13 months. By a reference to paragraph 43 of the report for 1876, it will be seen that we were unable to disburse some charges till after the 31st December of that year, and the whole of the expenditure for 1877 is shewn in the statement in addition to several amounts paid for December 1876. The charges which should be deducted to correct the average cost per head, &c., are as follow :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 33 of the culverts and drains could not have been carried out by means of free labour for probably less than five or six times the amount actually expended." Employment. 20. A large portion of the inmates was put to some employment, viz. 71 per cent., and this percentage has been gradually altered, inasmuch as in January there was only 32 per cent., whereas in December there was a per- centage of 82 of the males at work. As an example of the employments, October is selected. In this month 82.8 per cent. of the strength was employed as follows:34 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Establishment. 25. Mr. Birch speaks in the highest terms of Mr. Maunder, who gives the whole of his time to his duties. " He is active, zealous, industrious, strictly temperate, thoroughly trustworthy, and pains-taking to a degree. He has now sufficiently mastered Hindustani to be able to communicate freely with his subordinates and the patients. Certainly he has done his best in every way to work well and efficiently, and the only point on which he is still deficient is the ability to keep accurately the petty accounts of issue and expenditure of raw materials. " Mrs. Maunder, the Matron, is gentle, kind, efficient, and intelligent in the management of her department. " The Native Doctor is a respectable young man of superior qualifications and considerable intelligence, who has worked well and efficiently. The clerk is efficient and pains-taking in his department, and his conduct has been satis- factory ; but he suffers from an akward propensity to indispositions, which he deems a sufficient excuse for absence from duty. The keepers and other subor- dinates, on the whole, worked well. Sleeping while on watch at night is their chief offence." Paralysis of the insane. 26. Mr. Birch alludes to the remarkable fact of there being no cases of the general paralysis of the insane in this or in other asylums in India. Conclusion. 27. Attention is requested to the concluding paragraph of Mr. Birch's report, which is in these words : " That part of the work which is to connect the present cook-house shed with the dining-hall has not yet been commenced. It occurs to me, should it be contemplated to erect a pucka cook-house, as suggested by the Deputy Surgeon-General, the connecting work now sanctioned might judiciously be stopped, for the expense thereby saved would go far towards meeting that of the proposed erection; but it would be necessary to issue early orders." Inspection. Dr. Irving, Deputy Surgeon-General of the Dinapore circle, visited the asylum on the 22nd January 1878. He was unable to leave home on account of sickness in December, and was permitted to make his annual inspection for 1877 at the beginning of the present year. He reports that he found the place greatly improved since his last visit on the 20th November 1876, and adds that he found almost every inmate employed in some sort of workLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 35 PREDOMINANT FEATURES.

Regarding those returned " not insane" Dr. Payne has the following remarks:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 37 Special remarks. It seems right to bring to notice the remarks of Dr. Payne regarding some observations which were made by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor regarding the report of Bhowanipore Asylum for the year 1876, in a resolution dated 20th October 1877. " The Lieutenant-Governor noticed the high figure set down in the financial table as the average cost of each lunatic in the asylum, and drew the very natural conclusion that economy was not much studied in the place. I knew that the several changes introduced in late years had very greatly reduced the cost of the asylum; but this had not been acknowledged as their primary object, and consequently no attempt had ever been made to set forth in concise form the financial result. It was evident, too, that so long as the cost of working the asylum should continue to be represented in this manner, the Surgeon-General and the Government must remain in ignorance of many advantages gained or the reverse, and especially of the cost of that class of persons whom alone the State is supposed to maintain gratuitously. Accordingly I prepared and submitted in December a history of the asylum administration with especial reference to its cost from 1860 to its present time. I desired to embody in this paper all the infor- mation that could be obtained in the asylum records and elsewhere, and found it impossible to avoid altogether the confusion of financial with calendar years. The figures, therefore, cannot be checked by the annual returns; but I believe them to be absolutely trustworthy as to the points and the progress they are intended to illustrate. At the same time the results exhibited are large enough to be free from all risk of disturbance from any error or confusion that can have occurred." "If the argument put forward in that statement be accepted, it will be allowed that in an asylum for rich and poor, when the heaviest items are fixed charges, an average charge per head, without distinction of class or circumstance, though it be authentically faultless, must be utterly misleading for judgment on the proper use of the public money and on progress." " I have appended to this report the usual financial statement nevertheless, and it will serve as a further illustration of the fallacy. I have added a detailed statement of the sums expended on every item of charge from month to month. This repeated from year to year will be a true guide." " The entire cost of European lunatics in 1877 was Rs. 33,303. In this is included the passage-money of the paupers from Bombay to England, estimated at Rs. 550 each, with the cost of their conveyance to Bombay paid by the police, Rs. 452. We have not heard whether any payment has yet been made to Bombay for the maintenance of these persons before their embarka- tion, nor do we know how long they remain there. Our total figures may err, therefore, by a trifling amount." " This sum of Rs. 33,303 exceeds that returned for 1876 by Rs. 4,108. No accounts have been received from Bombay, and no entry was therefore made in the returns of 1876 of the cost of shipment. Five patients we despatched in that year, and, assuming the same rates as the above, we should add to the figures of 1876 a sum of Rs. 3,912 on this account. Again the total outlay of 1876 was not made to include the payments to private servants. This was an error; credit was taken in the column of receipts for wages paid by inmates for servants, and corresponding debit should have been made on the other side. A further addition of Rs. 889 for servants must be made for 1876, and a total sum of Rs. 4,801 results. The difference between the two years thus fairly drawn turns in favour of 1877." "Yet we have had some unusual demands to meet in 1877. Large and increased daily average number, with a proportion of paying patients, has raised our diet bills from Rs. 7,211 to Rs. 8,866 (we spent Rs. 140 on alcoholic stimulants in the year). With enhanced payment by these people it was right to improve our poor accommodation to the utmost. Furniture and decent table services were bought at a cost of nearly Rs. 1,000, whereupon our contingent charges rose from Rs. 2,203 to Rs. 2,793. The wages of private servants advanced from Rs. 889 to Rs. 1,698. All these things go to make up the gross outlay, and they must be mentioned here. This gross outlay, distributed over the entire number of inmates, and largely composed of items
38 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. with which most of them had nothing to do, yields a so called average of Rs. 1,148 per head." " On the other hand, we credit large returns from private patients, viz. Rs. 16,696, against Rs. 7,798 in 1876. The net cost of the year in review falls to Rs. 16,607, and the average cost of a patient to Rs. 572, against Rs. 823 in the preceding year. The average private patient has cost a little more, and paid a great deal more than he did in 1876. The pauper patient has cost exactly the same as he did before, and each of them is now returned as cheaper to the State by nearly Rs. 251." " A report on costs ought to include everything that is paid; therefore the Superintendent's half salary and all that of the Deputy are entered. These charges are constant and not controllable in the asylum; they amount annually to Rs. 10,308. Distributed in average over 29 inmates, this sum yields a charge against each one of Rs. 355. The male patients must have a European Overseer and the females a Matron. No effort of management will reduce this necessity, and their small pay affords a yearly average of Rs. 81 per patient. These few and uncontrollable items of charge represent together Rs. 436 per patient. If control is to be judged by averages, uncontrollable items should be discarded. If this be done we shall have a balance of Rs. 712 as the average cost of a patient in 1877. By excluding other irrelevant items we shall find it easy to prove by the method of averages that, so far as avoidable expense is concerned, the cost per individual has become a minus quantity, that is to say, the asylum, so far as avoidable expense is concerned, has been worked to a profit. Such reasoning is of course financially absurd, but the argument is valid as showing the entire absence of all connection between average cost and administration." Establishment. " Mr. DeVere, the Deputy Superintendent, and his wife, Mrs. DeVere, the Matron, are commended to the approval of Government. To them is due that the large number of paying patients has been entertained without a murmur being heard as to the narrow limits of the asylum or the want of proper accommodation. Their whole lives," continues Dr. Payne, " are devoted to the comfort and well-being of the patients committed to their care; but they are never unmindful of what is due to the Government in return, and it has been in many instances owing only to their persistent search for information that adequate payment has been insisted on and obtained from persons who spared no pains to deceive as to their means." Overseer McLaughlan has only been a few months in the asylum, and, so far as Dr. Payne has seen of him, he would appear to justify the excellent character he brought from his former employers. Deputy Surgeon-General R. Cockburn frequently visited the asylum during the year and invariably found it in excellent order. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, JAMES IRVING, M.D., Officiating Surgeon-General, Bengal.

Calcutta, the 3rd August 1878. READ( 2 ) this type, and of these 38 resulted in recoveries during the year. In Dacca the percentage of cures on admissions was 28.07; in Patna it was 35.8; in Cuttack 28.6; in Berhampore, where the admissions showed a considerable reduction and presumably include a large proportion of acute cases, 76.1. In Hazareebagh there were only 10 admissions and there were 17 cures among 245 patients; it is not stated how many recoveries were effected among the new patients; the percentage of cures is satisfactory, as most of the inmates of the asylum were originally selected for transfer from other asylums as chronic cases. 4. The Moydapore Asylum was closed during the year under the Lieute- nant-Governor's orders, and it is not anticipated that there will be any necessity for re-opening it. The gross capacity of the remaining asylums is 1,407, and the number confined in them on the last day of the year was 1,077. There was thus ample accommodation, and there was never anything but the most trifling overcrowding in any of the asylums. In Dullunda, Patna, and Hazareebagh the numbers in confinement on 31st December were much below the capacity of the asylums. They contained 202, 206, and 220 respectively, with accommodation for 293, 260, and 392. In Dullunda, however, the number of female lunatics was slightly in excess of the accommodation avail- able for this class. The Lieutenant-Governor has decided to utilize the asylum building at Dacca in the construction of a new central jail for the Eastern districts. A new asylum is being built. The Lieutenant-Governor has recently appointed a committee to consider the possibility of some modification in the distribution of the lunatics among the other asylums and of reductions in the cost of establishment. 5. The number of criminal lunatics in confinement continues to exhibit an increase. The following table shows the progress of the asylum population of this class during the past ten years:( 3 ) that lunatics of this class can generally be left with advantage to the care of their relatives, and the Lieutenant-Governor would wish the Surgeon-General to see if further discharges cannot be effected. Of 166 cases in which the predis- posing cause of insanity was ascertained, 156 were found to have originated in physical and 10 in moral circumstances. Of the former, 107 were attributed to the excessive use of ganja or bhang, 13 to undue indulgence in drink, and 2 to opium-eating. Of the latter, 7 were caused by grief. The Lieutenant-Governor can see no good reason why it was found impossible to ascertain anything of the previous habits of 119 of the 285 persons admitted. The large proportion of persons admitted to asylums suffering from the effects of excess in the use of ganja or bhang is worthy of remark. Of forty-four cases admitted or re-admit- ted to the Dullunda Asylum, in which it was known that insanity was due to physical causes, 28 were attributed to the use of these drugs. In Patna 41 out of 53, in Dacca 16 out of 32, in Cuttack 7 out of 8, in Berhampore 7 out of 10, and in Hazareebagh 8 out of 9 belonged to this class. Of 410 lunatics from this cause treated in the asylums, 56 completely and 51 partially recovered. The previous occupations of 240 only of the 285 patients admitted were known. Of these no less than 142 were cultivators, coolies, beggars, or unemployed. The great majority of the remainder were servants or small traders. Only 12 were artizans. One native doctor was the only representative of the professional classes. 7. The asylums generally were much more healthy than during the pre- vious year. The average daily number sick was only 68.99, or 6.17 per cent. of mean strength against 98.31, or 8.02 per cent. in 1876, and 84.45, or 7.75 per cent. in 1875. The numbers in hospital were greatest in Hazareebagh, Dacca, and Patna. It is explained that Dr. Birch in Hazareebagh admits freely to hospital all patients, however triflingly indisposed. In Dacca there was a good deal of fever and of diarrh( 4 ) Rs. 2,599, and the profits from manufactures were Rs. 12,237 against Rs. 8,177. The sum given in last year's report was Rs. 12,710, but it appears that this was incorrect, though details are not given. The net average cost for the two years cannot therefore be compared. The gross and net average cost of each patient in the different asylums are given in the following table :( 5 ) were wholly and 11 partially cured; 4 were despatched to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act; 3 were made over to the military authorities, and 2 were sent to Bombay for removal to Europe as still insane. There were no deaths during the year. In 18 cases among those admitted, insanity was here- ditary, and in 7 the predisposing cause was intemperance. The number of pay- ing patients treated during the year was 29, from whom the asylum recovered Rs. 15,592. There appears to be some misapprehension regarding the inci- dence of the charge of maintenance in the Bombay asylum of pauper lunatics sent to that port for shipment to England. Under the Financial Resolution of 22nd March 1877, this charge must be borne by the Government of Bombay, and the necessary arrangements for the adjustment have already been made. The proposal that payment should be made by other Governments for lunatics treated at Bhowanipore is inadmissible on the same ground. Dr. Payne's report on the financial history of this asylum has been forwarded to the Committee on Medical Expenditure for consideration. No doubt the heavy cost of superintendence distributed over such a small number of patients materially affects the average cost. 12. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to acknowledge the care and attention bestowed by all the Superintendents on the management of the asylums under their charge. The report now submitted is, so far as the treatment of the patients is concerned, most satisfactory; and the Lieutenant-Governor's personal observation has convinced him that all that is possible is done to alleviate their sufferings and restore them to intelligence. The Lieutenant- Governor is very glad to notice the favourable terms in which the Superinten- dents speak of the assistance which they have received from their subordinates. While thanking Dr. Irving for his report, the Lieutenant Governor has to point out that recommendations on specific points, such as the improvement of existing buildings, or the provision of additional accommodation, should be separately submitted to Government.

No. 449 B.G. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, BENGAL, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVT. OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 14th April 1879. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to the Honorable the Lieutenant-Governor, my report regarding the Lunatic Asylums of Bengal for the year 1878. The usual tabular statements are also submitted. 2. The only change in the superintendence of the asylums during the year has been at Hazaribagh. Surgeon-Major E. A. Birch, F.R.C.S., was Superintendent from the 1st January till the 8th June, when he went to Eng- land on medical certificate, making over charge to Surgeon J. J. Wood, M.B., who continued for the rest of the year. By Government order No. 4429 of the 31st December, the complete closure of Moydapore Asylum was sanctioned. It had contained no patients since the end of 1877, but a chowkidar had been kept up in order to look after the place. His services have now been dispensed with. By the same order it was directed that the asylum at Hazaribagh should be closed and its inmates transferred to other asylums. This order is in course of being carried out. 3. The general numerical results as to admissions, discharges, and mor- tality among the inmates is shown in the table which follows:2 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. STATEMENT No. 1.

It was further ordered that recovered lunatics who are in Patna Asylum shall be transferred to Bhagulpore Jail, those from Dacca and Dullunda to Alipore, and those from Berhampore and Cuttack to the Presidency Jail. 13.

The average cost of each diet for European pauper lunatics in Bhowanipore Asylum is said in the Report on Medical Expenditure in Bengal (1878), page 2, to be 4 annas and 6 pies daily, but there is no diet scale for the asylum, which I think there ought to be. Dr. Payne, however, states that the diet is varied frequently according to the ages and requirements of individuals and to the season of the year. 34. Table No. X of the appendix details the sanctioned establishment of each asylum, which does not call for further remarks. To the reports by Superintendents of the different asylums I must refer for the remarks made on the different members of the establishment under them. It may be stated generally that overseers, matrons, writers, native doctors, jemadars, and keepers are commended for their attention to their various duties. 35. Table No. XI of the appendix shows the receipts and expenditure on account of manufactures in each asylum, and the general result is that, out of a daily average population of 1051.30, 889.52, or 84.61 per cent., were occu- pied. This contrasts favorably with 1877, in which year the average popu- lation was 1117.03, and 911.95 were occupied, or 81.64 per cent. The remu- nerative occupations of the patients consist of weaving, oil-pressing, spinning, carpentry, cane-work soorkee-pounding. In addition, bakery, wheat-grinding, water-carrying, fuel-cutting, gardening, cooking, and cleaning the yard give occupation to many, and though not remunerative, are equally effective as conducing to recovery by preventing the patients from thinking of themselves or their delusions. In the following statement I have endeavoured to tabulate the profits of the last two years, and to show the proportion of inmates employed, and the proportion of profit due to each person employed as well as to each inmate:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Dullunda Luna- tic Asylum.

Sales have not been so active in 1878, as will be seen by the greater value of manufactured goods and raw materials at the end of the year. Prices of material have been very high, and that of manufactured produce less so in proportion. We have credited no profit on account of dietary articles prepared for the asylum. I have to report as usual of the devotion of Mr. Bancroft to his duties in the asylum. His health has unfortunately suffered and he is compelled to take leave to Europe. Mrs. Montiers, the matron, has managed the female ward exceedingly well, failing in nothing that is required of her. The darogah, Ilahi Buksh, has continued his careful activity in the interests of the people, and the head jemadar, Shaikh Boodhoo, has earned favorable introduction to your notice for his successful management of the criminal ward. The head clerk, Oparva Narain Bhattacharjee, has been indefatigable throughout the year, giving in time of need much more time and labor to the asylum than can be legiti- mately demanded of him, and never complaining, however heavy the additional calls have been, or however irregular his hours of rest.

The number of criminal lunatics discharged, transferred, &c., was 23, namely, 20 males and 3 females, as against 11 in 1877, 13 in 1876. The proportion of discharged to admitted was 109.5 per cent., as against 45.8 per cent. in 1877. Of those discharged 15 were sent to stand their trial; 2 were transferred to the non-criminal class; three were transferred to jail, and three were made over to their friends. Only one criminal lunatic died during the year, or in the proportion of 4.76 per cent. of the criminal admissions. In 1877 the number of deaths was three, or 12.5 per cent.; in 1876 it was six, or 23.07 per cent.; in 1875 it was eight, or 33.33 per cent. of the total criminal admissions. On the 31st of December there remained 73 male and 9 female criminal lunatics, total 82. The daily average number of this class of luna- tics was 84.78 (74.75 males and 10.03 females).

On my representation, the Surgeon-General sanctioned such an experiment being made for three months. The result was that a large majority of the inmates of the asylum lost weight during the time the reduced scale was in force, and at the end of the three months the former diet scale was resumed. I confess that the result surprised me. The same strict attention was given to the quantity and quality of the food issued every day as in the previous year, and every lunatic was periodically weighed about once in three months. As the result of these weighings, I find that 87 of the inmates gained and 94 lost weight during the year. The total gain was 6 maunds 12 seers and 7 chittacks, and the loss 5 maunds 32 seers and 7 chittacks, so that there was a gain of 20 seers in the course of the year over the whole population weighed. A large number of those who gained weight were recent admissions, and a very general loss of weight was noticeable during the hot months, and a corresponding gain at the end of the year.

The saving in outlay in establishment was made by reduction, a sweeper and a jemadar having been discharged at the latter end of the year. In the following table the receipts and expenditure of the asylum, with the average cost of each patient, is shown :24 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. By careful separation and the use of disinfectants and other preventive means the reappearance of the disease was prevented. The daily average sick during the year was 1.84; and the percentage of mortality to strength was 10.4 against 6.02 of last year. There were five deaths during the year, viz. the case of cholera abovementioned, one of pleuro-pneumonia, one from exhaustion following child-birth on a patient admitted 27 days before; two cases further died from diarrhLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 25 received by transfer, made a total population of 213 (males 149, females 64), giving a daily average strength of 193.19 (males 131.89, females 61.3) against a total remaining of 172, with 21 admissions, and a total population of 193, and a daily average strength of 166.27 in 1877. Thus, while the number of admissions was less by three, the total population was in excess by 20, compared with the figures of the previous year. This was due entirely to the transfer to the asylum of 39 insanes (males 30, females 9) who were the remaining inmates of the Moydapore Asylum, which has been abolished.

Cholera appeared on the 3rd July, when a very suspicious case occurred among the women, whose compound and ward are cut off from the rest of the asylum by a high wall. The native doctor, Annoda Pershad Dey, thought it a case of worms; but although a round worm was expelled by vomiting, yet I adhered to the diagnosis of cholera, the case was treated as such, and recovered. On the 10th July the second jemadar was taken ill at the asylum after a burra khana in the bazar, where cholera was. The next case among the patients, also a woman, occurred on the 4th July and proved fatal. On the 14th a careful post-mortem examination was made. The first case among the men happened on the 18th July, and proved fatal; and the other cases (two) on the 20th, (two) 22nd, (one) 23rd, (one) 30th of July, (one) 2nd, and (one) 5th of August, respectively. The female cases were isolated as far as possible, being treated in the workshed (there is no female hospital), and the males likewise in the isolation ward in the garden. The medicines used were chiefly simple astringents for vomiting and purging, effervescent drinks, tincture of cantharides, and nitrate and acetate of potash for suppression of urine. A trial was made here as in the Penitentiary with Amyl Nitrite, followed by Belladonna; but no definite advantage was noticed from the use of these two medicines.

The daily average of diets for 1878 was 207.1 and for 1877 222.06. The average cost per head was Rs. 39-13-3 for 1878 and Rs. 35-0-8 for 1877, showing an increase of Rs. 4-12-7.3 per head. This increase is due to the dearness of provisions30 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The daily average number of inmates in 1878 was 28. The several forms of insanity were represented as follows among the admissions and the total number treated:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 31 In reporting on the expenditure of the asylum in 1877,I ventured to point out the fallacy that must attend the use of averages in estimating the cost incurred by the State for the care of lunatics of several classes receiving treatment in accordance with their condition. of life and payment. No orders having been received to the contrary, I append the usual statement of expenditure, which confirms what I have said by shewing that the average patient has cost for establishment alone nearly double the sum which has covered his whole expenses, establishment included. The table exhibits a gross outlay of Rs. 25,106 against Rs. 33,303 in 1877, an average gross cost per patient of Rs. 897 against Rs. 1,148, and an average net cost of Rs. 316 against Rs. 572.

READ( 2 ) of recoveries was too small to render a calculation of averages of any value, there were altogether 27 cures out of a total population of 469. The mortality per cent. of mean strength was 9.51, as compared with 6.53 in 1877 and 10.85 in the six years, 1872-77. 4. The returns for the past year show a further increase in the number of criminal lunatics in confinement, the number of this class on the 31st December 1878 being 288, against 278 in 1877, and a daily average of 196.3 during the ten years from 1868 to 1877. The admissions for the past ten years have been nearly constant, having been 70 in 1878, 68 in 1877, and an average of 66 for the ten previous years. In the resolution on the report for 1877, the Lieutenant-Governor drew attention to the question of segregating bond fide criminal lunatics from ordinary insane patients, and it was stated that the question had been referred to a Committee for considera- tion. The Committee, when submiting their report at the close of the past year, pointed out that, however desirable it might be to have a special asylum for criminal lunatics, the object was practically unattainable in Bengal. It would be scarcely possible to assemble in any one building all classes of insane criminals, those under trial, those acquitted on the ground of insanity, and those under sentence in jails, scattered throughout the whole province. The proposal for a special asylum for criminal lunatics has therefore been abandoned. Recovered criminal lunatics who cannot, with reference to their previous history, be safely discharged will in future be transferred to jail for confine- ment under section 430 of the Criminal Procedure Code and be employed on the jail establishments, or on light labour. The presence in the asylums of these recovered lunatics, whom it was impossible to discharge, has long been found to be detrimental to discipline and good management, and with their removal the principal reason for a special criminal asylum will, as pointed out by the Committee, have disappeared. The transfer to jail of 15 recovered criminal lunatics has been ordered by Government since the close of the past year. In each case the visitors certified that the prisoner had for years shown no sign of insanity, and could safely be removed to jail, while the history of the case showed that the man's release would not be right, though while kept in confinement, away from the temptation of intoxicating drugs, there was no reason to fear a fresh outbreak of insanity. In such cases as these, the removal of the prisoner from the depressing surroundings of a lunatic asylum by his transfer to active life in jail is an act of humanity to the prisoner as well as desirable in the interests of good discipline and economy. 5. Of 1,264 persons who were under treatment during the year, 259 were suffering from acute mania, 487 from chronic mania, 114 from melancholia, 61 from acute dementia, and 297 from chronic dementia. There was a satis- factory falling-off in the number of cases of chronic mania and chronic dementia, the number of cases of these forms of lunacy, which are seldom capable of cure, having been respectively 548 and 331 in 1877. There were 11 cases of idiocy and 5 of imbecility in each of the past two years, one case of dementia in 1878 against two in 1877; and 29 cases were described as "not insane," against 36 similarly entered in 1877. No explanation is given regarding these cases, but the persons described must, it is assumed, have been sent to the asylums on the certificate of the Civil Surgeon, or after acquittal on the ground of insanity, although on arrival at the asylums they may have shown no signs of insanity. Of 123 new admissions, in which the predisposing cause of insanity was ascertained and recorded, 111 are assigned to physical and 12 to moral circumstances. Of the former, 85 cases were attributed to the excessive use of ganja, bhang and churrus, 5 to spirits, and 3 to opium. In 5 cases the cause assigned was heredi- tary predisposition, and 9 cases were attributed to grief. Of the whole number of patients in the asylums in 1878, the cause of insanity is given in 601 cases, and 405 of these are assigned to the excessive use of ganja, bhang, churrus, spirits and opium. Out of the 405, only 69 completely and 14 partially recovered during the year. The previous occupations of only 199 out of 227 patients admitted and re-admitted during the year were ascertained: of these, 111 were cultivators, coolies, beggars, or unemployed; of the remainder, 25 were servants and 11 shop-keepers. 6. The health of lunatics in confinement was better during the past year than in any of the three previous years. The average daily number
( 3 ) of sick in the asylums was only 60, or 5.7 per cent. of mean strength, against 68.99, or 6.17 per cent. of mean strength in 1877, and 8.02 and 7.75 per cent. in 1876 and 1875 respectively. The numbers in hospital, as well as the percentages on the mean strength, were, as in 1877, highest in Hazareebagh, Dacca and Patna, the percentages of sick in the asylums at these stations being 10.32, 8.17 and 5.83 respectively. Notwithstanding the prevalence of sickness in Calcutta and its neighbourhood, the Dullunda asylum was remarkably healthy during the past year. With a daily average population of 204 persons, the average number of sick was only 3.15. Out of 784 cases treated in the hospitals of the different asylums during the year, 240, 111, and 119 were respectively cases of fever, dysentery, and diarrhoea, while in Dullunda only one case of fever and one of diarrh( 4 ) cost of each patient in the different asylums are given in the following state- ment, the Cuttack asylum alone showing a lower cost for patients than in 1877:( 5 ) of the asylums, the profits were Rs. 10-11-4 per head, against Rs. 10-15-3 in 1877. Both Dr. Crombie and Dr. Bird appear to have devoted much attention to the profitable employment of the lunatics in the Dacca and Patna asylums, and their efforts were eminently successful. The Committee on Medical Expenditure have recently recommended that the system noticed in last year's resolution, of giving lunatics a direct interest in the out-turn of their labour, should be tried, and the Lieutenant-Governor has accordingly authorized the adoption of the system experimentally, the details being left to the discretion of the Superintendents of the different asylums. 10. There were only 23 new admissions to the Bhowanipore asylum, against 34 in 1877. Of the 50 inmates treated during the year five died, six were discharged as cured, two were transferred to the military authorities as partially cured, five were despatched to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, and twelve were made over to the care of their friends. In 26 out of the 50 cases treated insanity was hereditary, and five of the remaining cases were attri- buted to intemperance. The number of paying patients treated during the year was 29, the same number as treated in 1877, and from these the asylum recovered Rs. 15,475. In addition to this amount a sum of Rs. 791 was charged to the Port Dues Fund on account of the maintenance of sailors treated in the asylum. 11. The Lieutenant-Governor gladly acknowledges the success with which all the Superintendents have administered the institutions in their charge. The subordinate establishments of all the asylums are favourably noticed by the Superintendents, and cases of ill-treatment of patients by keepers were extremely rare.

But the Hazaribagh Asylum cannot be excluded, for its inmates have exist- ed in other asylums and raised their sick lists. Comparision of total with total in the several years is therefore proper, and it gives only 510 admis- sions in 1879, against 739 in 1878, and 818 in 1877. This would seem to show that the health of the Hazaribagh lunatics had improved after their removal. It is probable that during the existence of the Hazaribagh Asylum in 1879 its sick list was a long one, for nine deaths took place in the three months, and the lunatics, transferred, reached their destinations in very poor condition. The ratio per cent. of daily sick to mean strength was greater than in 1878 in the Dullunda, Patna, and Berhampore Asylums, less at Dacca, and somewhat less at Cuttack. STATEMENT No. 8. Dullunda.

In the Patna Asylum two cases of injury occurred, both caused by patients ; a rib was fractured in one case, and a bone of the hand in the other. At Dullunda there were two cases of injury, both by patients. A man received a blow on the head in the night while asleep from a neighbour ; in the other case a bone of the hand was broken by a sudden blow from a close neighbour. From Cuttack and Berhampore no case of injury is reported. 17. Mortality.8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. accounted for four.

These points have to be fully considered in appor- tioning blame to servants and to systems, but they were occurrences of a different kind which attracted the attention of my predecessor and of the Government in former years, and the avoidance of which in 1879 shows that they are not inseparable from asylum life. 26. The higher mortality of 1879 does not point to anything that calls for change in sanitary management. There has been no epidemic outbreak, nor any such prevalence of zymotic disease as to indicate defective sanitation. A great proportion of the deaths have been due to organic disease, and much of the fatal illness did not originate within the Asylums. The mortality among the lunatics transferred from Hazaribagh was great, but not so great as it had been at Hazaribagh prior to removal, while there is reason to believe that the general health of the whole number has benefited by the change. 27. Finance.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 returns of establishment should be so prepared as to show separately the cost of superintendence and of the lower service. These orders were received too late to be carried out in the returns now summarised. It is necessary therefore to mention once more the exceptional position of the Dullunda Asylum in respect of establishment. Allowing for the difference of salaries of Superin- tendent, Deputy Superintendent, and Matron, the cost per head on this account, as it should be stated for comparison, is Rs. 58. The expenditure was less than before under every head, but in the above statement it appears larger from the failure of industrial returns to be presently explained. The sum of Rs. 30,900, entered as expended, represents the total receipts for asylum use from Govern- ment direct and from the manufactures, less the receipts from paying-patients remitted to the treasury. The total cost of each lunatic in 1879 was Rs. 138 against Rs. 166 in 1878, or Rs. 142 in 1879, if purchase of land and contin- gencies for paying-patients be included, against Rs. 173 in 1878. From the treasury there was drawn Rs. 22,082 against Rs. 28,499 in 1878 and Rs. 28,926 in 1877. The receipts from paying-patients were less by nearly one-half than in 1878, and from the manufacturing department more: this increase is not real. The heading of the return No. 9 is worded to show the value of manufactured articles, and it has been usual to fix this value by bazar price-lists corrected each month. This was disallowed in 1878, and the cost of production only was entered. To make the figure correspond with the industrial account, no profit was entered on the articles made over for asylum use. It has been lately ordered that such articles are to be made over for use without any intermediary, with reference to the practice in some places of selling produce to a purveyor and repurchasing from him, but it is not intended, I presume, that only cost price shall be charged, as to do this is to ignore the contribution which the lunatics make to their own maintenance without improving the financial statement. The total expenditure at Dul- lunda therefore is weighted with a charge for profit which it did not bear in 1878. The rest of the excess is due to diminished receipts and values of material and produce in store, which resulted in a money profit of Rs. 1,713 only on labour. The reasons for the falling off are these. Fall in market prices and loss on produce manufactured at a high cost; absence of the Deputy Superintendent and some loss of business connection; transfer to jail of recovered lunatics, including the best workmen; absorption of labour in cleaning tanks and redeeming bustee land annexed to the asylum, for which no charge was made in the accounts, but which, valued at the price received for lunatics similarly employed outside, was worth Rs. 2,553. 29. The establishment at Dullunda cost in 1879 less by Rs. 2,115 than in 1878. From the 9th of September the Superintendent drew a reduced salary. For six months the Deputy Superintendent's salary was not drawn from provincial funds. There was reduction in the scale of the lower establishment. The cost of establishment per head was Rs. 77 against Rs. 92 in 1879. After deducting the difference of special salaries, the figure to be used for comparison with other asylums is Rs. 58 against Rs. 61 in 1878. This figure was erroneously given in the Surgeon-General's report in 1878. 30. The cost of diet was less by Rs. 8-7 per man than in 1878. Prices fell considerably, and the new diet scale was cheaper, even when bazar prices were charged instead of actual costs. In clothing there is a trifling increase in charge, which is also unreal, being due to the substitution of value for mere cost. Bazar medicines were nominal in cost as before. Contingencies fell, though the list included some charges which elsewhere would have been met by the Public Works Department, and included also Rs. 557, paid as compensation to the lessee of the land which was annexed to the asylum grounds, and Rs. 249 spent on paying-patients. 31. It may be mentioned also that the acquisition of new land involved the erection of a new garden shed with gardener's quarters, which was charged to the manufacturing department. 32. In the Dacca Asylum, establishment cost Rs. 9,144 in 1879, against Rs. 9,007 in 1878. The civil hospital assistant received his allowance for qualification in English, and the writer the stipulated increment of Rs. 2. There was also the expense of an officiating overseer during the absence of the
12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. permanent officer. The cost of diet was Rs. 11,929 against Rs 12,793 in 1878, or Rs. 60-13-4 per head against Rs. 65-1-3 in 1878. Dr. Crombie writes that during the first nine months of the year the prices of provisions attained a higher point than even in 1878, and that in June there was a widely-felt scarcity in the district with rice at Rs. 4 per maund. Other articles rose in proportion, and the cost of diet would have been as high as in 1878, but that Dr. Crombie, with Dr. Irving's sanction, modified the diet scale and made an attempt to " formulate a more scientific diet scale of less cost." He was not entirely satisfied with his first results, finding that the people lost weight, and he made further changes. During the last three months of the year prices fell, so that his average cost per man for the entire year was Rs. 60-13-4, and of each diet 2 annas 8 pie nearly. During the last three months each diet cost only 2 annas 2 2/3 pie. 33. Clothing cost at Dacca Rs. 708 in 1879 against Rs. 872 in 1878, or Rs. 3-9-9 per head against Rs. 4-7-1. Contingencies, including repairs, travelling allowance to lunatics transferred, and value of articles received from the manu- facturing department, amounted to Rs. 660 against Rs. 713 in 1878, or Rs. 3-5-10 per head against Rs. 3-10-1 To this there should be added the cost of uniforms to attendants, viz. Rs. 146-4, making the total Rs. 806-4 in 1879, and the cost per head Rs. 4-1-10. The manufacturing sale proceeds amounted to Rs. 6,329 against Rs. 6,315 in 1878, but the profits fell from Rs. 3,923 to Rs. 3,221. Raw materials cost more, and profits fell because the supply of bricks, says Dr. Crombie, found by digging in the grounds, had become exhaust- ed. These were converted in former years into soorkee, free of cost, as raw material, and the sale proceeds appeared entirely as profit. 34. In the Patna Asylum the amount received from the treasury in 1879 was Rs. 17,648 against Rs. 18,866 in 1878, and the value of manufactured articles used was Rs. 3,522 against Rs. 3,808LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 discharge, and as clothing and passage home are already provided for such persons, nothing further seems to be required. Dr. Stewart writes from Cuttack:14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. Dr. Stewart at Cuttack was fully satisfied with the conduct of his darogah as was Dr. Shircore at Berhampore with that of Baboo Mohendro Nath Roy, the overseer, and of the clerk and hospital assistant. 46. Under recent orders the reports of the several asylums will be printed in extenso, and copies forwarded to all the Superintendents, who alone are interested in many of the details which a complete report presents. For this reason I have not thought it necessary to present with this report the long extracts hitherto furnished, which have consisted largely of comments on the figured statements already analysed in the general report. Under the several headings full extracts have been given to illustrate each subject as it came under consideration, and in this manner I have incorporated all the matter of the reports which bears on the condition, management, and progress of the asylums during the year. 47.

All the fluctuating charges indeed were smaller, except that for clothing, which depends on other circumstances. The Superintendent's salary shows reduction.

A suit has been instituted for the recovery of it. The orders of Government are solicited for the writing off as irrecoverable of a sum of Rs. 12-6-2. In the report on 1878 this debt was mentioned with little hope of recovering it. All efforts to trace the debtor have now failed. 55. It will be observed that notwithstanding reduction of expenditure under every head but that of clothing, reduced numbers have raised the average under every head but that of diet. 56. The services of Mr. and Mrs. Devere, the Deputy Superintendent and Matron, have been as valuable to the asylum in this as in former years. They receive expressions of gratitude from every patient who leaves the asylum in health. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, A. J. PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-General, Bengal.

FROM A. J. PAYNE, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MEDICAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 20th May 1880. SIR, IN conforming to the Lieutenant-Governor's wish for a more complete report on the mortality in the Lunatic Asylums of Bengal in 1879, I beg to say that, when my original report was submitted, I was conscious that I was offering the Government little more than a summary of events. I knew that much time would be needed for preparation of the reports on the Calcutta medical institutions and the dispensaries of the province, and had no hope of producing these within the prescribed period ; unless the asylum report, the least important, were speedily finished. It was thus impossible for me to make the references and obtain the other information required for the fuller discussion of matters which have very naturally appeared to the Lieutenant-Governor to have been inadequately treated. 2. Haste in preparation led also, I regret to say, to some inaccuracies in my report which I may now indicate. Paragraph5.( 2 ) 3. The first point to be noticed concerning the mortality of 1879 is, that there has been great increase in the death-rates of all the asylums, Cuttack from the smallness of its numbers being left unconsidered. There was no epidemic disease. The public health of the year, so far as it is yet known, was generally better than 1878. If, therefore, the mortality of the asylums have a common cause, it will probably be in great part a cause special to themselves. Such a cause existed in the distribution, between the affected asylums, of the lunatics from Chota Nagpore. These people had been dying in large numbers at Hazaree- bagh up to the time when the asylum was closed. The state of health in which they reached Calcutta and Berhampore was very bad, and it was probably not much better at Patna. Of 60 persons sent to Dullunda eight died; of 54 sent sent to Patna six died; of 32 sent to Berhampore ten died, and of 17 sent to Dacca one died. Of the total number distributed, viz. 163, there died in the several places 25 persons, in nine months. At Hazareebagh, in 1878, of a total of 229 persons there had died 43; and during the first two-and-a-half months of 1879 the deaths were nine in 175, or nearly 27 per cent. of the total per annum, a rate much higher than the highest recorded elsewhere. Thus, though the transfers added largely to the death lists of the other asylums, the transferred people gained by a reduced death-rate among themselves. 4. Having regard to the great influence on mortality of the condition in which persons newly admitted reach an asylum, it would be more correct to reckon death-rates on total numbers treated, as is done in hospitals, than on the average population, as is done in jails.

It is disturbed only by the case of Berhampore, where the death-rate among the transferred persons was very high. If the transfers be separated, the order will be unbroken, viz.( 3 ) four asylums shewed increase of deaths from 52 to 119, a difference of 67 whereof 27, or the sum of the foregoing differences, were contributed by new admissions. Separating these new admissions, we obtain the following figures for the older residents :( 4 ) town and suburbs. The neighbouring jails repeat the evidence. The deaths from bowel disorders have been as follows:( 5 ) pensable in every case of death in a lunatic asylum. The tendency to phthisis among lunatics was long ago established in Europe. 11. For the sake of completing the enquiry, I will deal with the possi- bility of weak or sickly persons becoming phthisical at Dullunda, who might have escaped the disease elsewhere, and consider all the life-circumstances which have been from time to time supposed to tend to its production, viz. the influ- ence of air, food, clothing, and the state of the soil. As to pure air and breathing-space there is not much to be said. Of the atmosphere the lunatics have full benefit. Their lives are spent, by day, prac- tically in the open air. At night they sleep in rooms well raised on arches, well ventilated and dry, having floors of asphalt. The space is ample. Ventilation, though good, is less perfect in the female wards, but here phthisis is com- paratively rare. Food has been good and sufficient throughout. In 1879 it was better adapted than before to the habits of the people, if increase of flesh be evidence. The diet scale, however, had little to do with the fatal cases, of which the majority had been fed on extras as weak persons, when not in hospital. Clothing is extravagantly good. Home-made blankets, of weight and substance unknown in the market, are supplied in any number that may be required, and made into coats that the people may wear them at work in damp or chilly weather. 12. The soil is, as to its surface, perfectly drained. There is not a puddle to be seen half an hour after the heaviest rain; but of the subsoil I cannot give so good an account and this is very important if there be a tendency to phthisis at Dullunda. Among the evidences of causation advanced from time to time concerning phthisis, none has been seen to meet so many of the facts, and none has received such wide subsequent confirmation and acceptance, as the conclusion which followed the enquiry of the Privy Council into the results of main-drainage in 25 English towns in 1866. It was placed beyond doubt that towns notorious for the prevalence of phthisis became com- paratively free from it when their subsoil water was withdrawn. Many years ago, when searching for a reason for high mortality at Dullunda, while the Presidency Jail close at hand was very healthy, I could discover nothing but a great difference in the level of the subsoil water. The relation of this to phthisis was not then known; but it may now be mentioned, as an interesting difference between the two situations, that in the jail the sub-soil water is very low at times when, in Dullunda, it is within a few feet of the surface. The proximity of the two places does not prevent this difference, for the same may be seen in other parts of Calcutta. Of course actual mea- surements, carried on through an entire year, would be necessary to establish the fact of this difference as otherwise than accidental. The evidence, however, as it stands, is quite as good as that of the local production of phthisis at Dullunda. The occurrence of the disease in the two places, apart from its production, may be examined here in order to leave nothing unsaid. 13. In the Presidency Jail in 1879 there were admitted into hospital 8 natives on account of phthisis. There had been 9 in 1878 and 20 in 1877. There were no deaths in 1879 or in 1878 from phthisis, but 4 in 1877. Short- term prisoners do not remain in jail to die of chronic illness. The figures only show that there was no increase of phthisis here in 1879. At Alipore the admissions did not differ materially in the three years, but the deaths in 1879, were 10 only against 15 in each of the earlier years. The course of other pulmonary diseases appears in curious contrast. It was as follows:( 6 ) 14. It is unfortunate that the enquiry cannot be extended by means of the records of the Health Office of Calcutta. Pulmonary diseases are the class concerning which, above all others, these records afford no guidance. Acute chest-diseases, attended with heat of skin, are for the most part returned as fevers, and their prevalence or otherwise cannot be inferred with even an approximation to truth. Those unattended with heat are named asthma. Some little evidence may be gathered from the admissions into hospital. The number of natives admitted in 1878 to four hospitals for pulmonary disease, other than phthisis, was not unusually large, but the fatality was greater than in either of the preceding years. The same is true of phthisis on the figures. The hospital returns of bowel disorders exhibit reduced admissions but extra- ordinary fatality, as already said. 15. In the Patna asylum deaths rose from 13 in 1878 to 35 in 1879. If the latter year were one of improved public health in Bengal generally, it was not so at Patna, where it is described as the most unhealthy year since 1874. The increase here was in the ordinary climatic diseases chiefly. Cholera prevailed in the neighbourhood and there were six deaths in the asylum. There had been none in 1878. Diarrh( 7 ) The public health in the town and district of Dacca shewed marked im- provement. Bowel disorders were reduced ; pulmonary diseases are not distin- guished in the Sanitary Returns. In probable accordance with this general improvement, nothing is said in the Asylum Report of the condition of lunatics on admission. 17. At Berhampore the additional deaths were due as follows:Dated Darjeeling, the 17th May 1880. RESOLUTION( 2 ) The local admissions were, it will be seen, extremely few; the re-admis- sions merely represent escapes and recaptures; the death-rate was in 1876 8.82 per cent. of mean strength, in 1877 4.95 per cent., in 1878 20.7 per cent. (a remarkably heavy rate, not accounted for by any epidemic); the sick list was throughout heavier than in any other asylum in Bengal. On the whole, the results of the experimental opening of an asylum in Chota Nagpore were not satisfactory, and it was on every ground advisable to close this asylum. 5. Turning to the statistics of the year, the chief facts affecting the population of each asylum are embodied in the following table:( 3 ) but the smaller number of such cases in the total of acute mania reduces the recoveries under that head from 26 per cent. in 1878 to 18. The same influence has also affected the percentage of cure under other heads. 9. The causes of insanity were unknown in exactly half the cases admitted and re-admitted taken together (98 out of 196). In 81 cases physical causes were assigned, and in 17 moral causes; 43 ordinary and 18 criminal cases were ascribed to the use of ganga, bhang, or churrus; 5 ordinary and 1 criminal case to ardent spirits; 1 ordinary and 1 criminal case to opium. In by far the greater number of known cases, therefore, the use of drugs is believed to have been the procuring cause of insanity. 10. The health of the asylums during the year was by no means satis- factory. Although the total number of admissions to hospital was only 510 as against 739 in 1878 and 818 in 1877, cases of fatal sickness were more numerous. There are no returns of the admissions to hospital at Hazaribagh for the three months during which that asylum was open; and this fact serves to reduce the apparent total of admissions in 1879. If Hazaribagh be excluded altogether, the number of admissions was nearly the same as in 1878, and less by 86 than in 1877. But, as the Surgeon-General remarks, the inmates of Hazaribagh were only transferred to the other asylums, and helped to raise the totals of their sick lists for the remainder of the year.The totals of the year may therefore not unfairly be compared with those of 1878. The following table gives an analysis of the figures for each asylum:( 4 ) It will be seen that the great increase in mortality, viewed as a whole, is a feature common to Dullunda, Dacca, and Patna, and that although the absolute number of deaths from pulmonary disease in Dullunda is large, the proportionate number of deaths in that asylum from. diseases of that class is but little higher than in 1878. 12. Taking the asylums separately, the returns for Dullunda for 1878 showed 34 admissions to hospital during the year, and two remaining from the preceding year, or a total of 36 under treatment. Of these, 15 were cured, 15 died, and 6 were left in hospital at the close of the year. There was only 1 case of fever, one of diarrh( 5 ) 15. In Patna asylum also the returns of sickness and mortality present similar features. The number of admissions in 1878 was 81, and the total under treatment 86. The deaths were 13, of which 4 were due to fever and 3 to spleen congestion, 3 to diarrhoea and dysentery, and 1 to phthisis. In 1879 there were 170 admissions and 172 under treatment, with no fewer than 35 deaths. Pulmonary diseases and cholera were both in excess, the former accounting for 3, the latter for 6 deaths. Diarrh( 6 ) 22. The plan of crediting the lunatics with part of the money value of their labor is only found to answer when the proceeds are given out at once in the form of extra indulgences. That is perhaps the best shape in which to reward the ordinary chronic patients; but where there is a fair prospect of cure, the money earned should be set aside for the patient, and be given him on dis- charge. The daily average number of lunatics employed in useful work was 763.23 out of a daily average strength of 889.96. 23. In the foregoing paragraphs only the native asylums of the province have been considered. The statistics of the European asylum at Bhowanipore are set out by the Surgeon-General in the concluding paragraphs of his report. On the 1st of January 1879 there were 20 patients remaining over from the preceding year. Twenty were admitted in 1879 against 23 in 1878, of whom only 2 were from the army. Of the 40 under treatment, 4 were cured, 1 made over to the military authorities, 4 sent to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, 7 made over to friends, and 4 died. Of the 4 deaths, 2 were due to old age, 1 patient having been 47 years in the asylum. One patient was dangerously ill on admission. The fourth died from the exhaustion of long- continued maniacal seizures. The cost of the asylum was Rs. 22,095 against Rs. 25,106 in 1878. The number of first and second class paying patients was much lessANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1880. BY A. J. PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal.

No. 1265½. FROM ARTHUR J. PAYNE, ESQ., M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal. TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL, POLITICAL, AND APPOINTMENT DEPARTMENTS. Fort William, the 28th March 1881. SIR, I HAVE the honour of reporting as follows on the working of the Lunatic Asylums in Bengal during the year 1880. I regret that this report will be less brief than I could wish, for it is necessary again to treat in full detail the subject of asylum mortality. 2. In letter from the Government of India, No. 300, dated 21st June 1880, some modifications were ordered in the statements to be submitted with these reports. Some of these statements will therefore be no longer uniform with those submitted in past years. The tables in the body of the report have hitherto shown the work of the asylums separately. These details are now given in the appendix, and aggregates only will appear in the text. The deviations from standard forms in last year's report, noticed by the Government of India, have been rectified with one exception, to be explained hereafter.

It is an example of a kind of error which abounds in official statisticsLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL 5 appear that this expectation was not unfounded, inasmuch as the later years, which have brought progressive diminution in general numbers admitted and the total of residents, have shown larger numbers, with a tendency to increase in the criminals. Moreover, there have been during these later years many criminal lunatics removed to jail who in former years remained in the asylums. On the other hand, it was formerly usual for the Government to set at liberty criminals who had passed long periods without sign of insanity. This practice has ceased for some years. Also, on the other hand, it has become a recent practice with Magistrates to commit summarily to the asylums, or at least to the Presidency Asylum, as unfit to make their defence persons who had committed offences under the passing delirium of intoxication or other transient cause, and who, on their admission, were at once returned as fit to take their trial. This growing habit was specially reported to Government in 1880, but not before it had contributed to the number of the so-called criminal lunatics. Regarding the year 1880, it must further be said that the number of criminals ordered from asylums into jail custody was smaller than before, and, concerning the two last years, that the numbers have been swollen by increase of re-admissions after trial. Thus, while the number of criminal lunatics has been unquestionably high from 1876 onwards, the excess over former years has not been so great as it would appear on the figures to have been, nor has the essential point of progressive increase been yet established so clearly as it would appear to have been. 13. If it had been possible for me to do so, I should have been glad to have departed here from the scope of an asylum report, so far as to present a comparative statement of the crimes or offences charged against the lunatics committed to asylums in the earlier and later years; for though the infor- mation does not relate to any matter of asylum management, it would have an important bearing on the question of crime as increased by recent policy. My impression is strong that lately the minor offences have been more largely represented among criminal lunatics than formerly they were, and it is pro- bable enough that acts of mischief, trespass, petty theft, and so forth, may be common among imbecile persons and others now excluded from asylums, who formerly were by custody prevented from committing them. It is my intention to collect the information which asylum records afford on this subject, and if it should be sufficiently complete, to prepare a comparative statement of offences charged against lunatics for ten years for submission with my next report.

To the 6th statement I attach little value, for reasons previously stated. It purports to give statistics of insanity among communities. The size of the communities is not and cannot be known, and if this were ascertain- able with precision, it would lead to no conclusion, from the large admixture of intoxication with insanity.

Causes of insanity.8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 20. These figures show the variations of the principal diseases in the two last years. There was total reduction of cases entered as anæmia and debility from 60 to 47, the chief difference being at Patna, where numbers fell from 40 to 24. There was some little increase at the Presidency and Berhampore. It is probable that under the regular practice of post mortem examinations, the vague names of debility and anæmia will appear less frequently in asylum returns. Of the 65 admissions to the Patna Asylum, no less than 43 were in bad or indifferent health, the majority in a state of debility. Cholera in 1880 was confined to the Patna and Berhampore Asylums ; in the former there was less than in 1879, but more in the latter. The disease at Berhampore did not appear as a single outbreak, but in groups of cases at intervals between the months of May and September. The course of events in the several jails will appear below. DiarrhLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 24. At the Presidency Jail anæmia and debility were grealty reduced in prevalence. At Alipore numbers also fell. In the asylum there was some increase. Cholera was present in less quantity in the Presidency Jail, and was almost absent from Alipore. It was, as usual, absent from the asylum. Diarrh10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 30. Mortality.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 37. I append the information received from the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, and Health Officer, Calcutta, concerning mortality in the several towns in 1879 and 188012 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 43. From anæmia, debility, anasarca, and dropsy there were 16 deaths in 1879 and 14 in 1880. The variations were, at the Presidency from 4 to 6 ; at Patna from 6 to 3 ; at Dacca from 1 to 3 ; at Berhampore from 3 to 1; at Cuttack from 2 to 1. Of the fatal cases at the Presidency, 4 were ill from admission, and at Dacca all were ill from admission. Here the events of 1880 indicate no preventive action. 44. Deaths from cholera fell in total from 7 in 1879 to 4 in 1880. Of the latter number, 3 were contributed by Berhampore and 1 by Patna. 45. DiarrhLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 lunatics in the manner required for the detection of phthisis, which I have myself experienced, and to the frequency with which disease had been dis- covered post mortem which I had not known to exist during life, it appeared among the results of last year's enquiry that if, in other asylums, examination post mortem had not been made as a matter of course, as it was not formerly at the Presidency, it might very well happen that the late predominance of phthisis in the Dullunda records and apparent increase elsewhere, would become intelli- gible. I called accordingly for statements from all the asylums showing the total number of deaths, the number of post mortem examinations, and the number of phthisical deaths, from the year 1865 to date. The record is very impressive. Wherever the number of examinations has borne high propor- tion to the total number of deaths, the proportion of deaths ascribed to phthisis has been also high. At the Presidency Asylum between 1865 and 1869 there were 271 deaths in all and 31 examinations, with 8 deaths from phthisis. From 1870 to 1874 there were 253 deaths, 42 examinations, and 26 deaths from phthisis. From 1875 to 1878 there were 122 deaths, 72 examinations, and 32 deaths from phthisis. In 1879 and 1880 there were 80 deaths, 77 examinations, and 27 deaths from phthisis. 52. At Dacca, between 1865 and 1876, examination was usual. There were in this period 467 deaths, 409 examinations, and 71 deaths from phthisis14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 57. Finance.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 61. The proportional cost of superintendence at Cuttack is exceptionally high, owing to the small number of patients treated at that asylum. The Dullunda Asylum stands next. The comparative high salary of the Deputy Superintendent and other servants of the asylum, who necessarily receive higher wages in Calcutta, explains the excess. In Dacca the establishment proper is somewhat high for similar reasons. The other figures do not call for any special remarks. On the whole there is a reduction of Rs. 2-11-5 in the establishment charge per head in 1880, as compared with the preceding year. 62. The cost of diet fell in all the asylums from Rs. 47-13-3 per head in 1879 to Rs. 35-14-8 in 1880. The reduction is especially to be observed at Dacca and Patna. In the former place the cost was reduced from Rs. 60-13-4 to Rs. 42-3-9, and in the latter from Rs. 45-3-8 to Rs. 26-13-1. These reductions are chiefly due to the value of raw materials being only charged in the accounts instead of the cost of manufactured articles at the market value. The fall in the price of food articles in the outlying stations has also had the effect of reducing the expenditure under this head considerably. In Dacca the decrease is attributable to a change of diet in 1880, as well as to the fall in the price of food articles. The value of articles made over as diet from manufactures amounted to Rs. 503-2-9 only. In Dullunda the general reduction of 1880 does not bear comparison with other asylums. Here a change of diet, made for reasons above stated, led to increased expendi- ture. The increase appears as cash expended, because the most costly article, viz. meat, was purchased in the market. The reduction in 1879 is therefore insignificant, although the articles of diet supplied from manufactures were charged at the cost of production, and not at their market value. The price of meat at Dullunda is Rs. 12-8 per maund, against Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 per maund charged at Patna and Berhampore. Similarly the price of paddy, husked into rice for asylum use, is considerably higher in Calcutta than in the other asylums. 63. The cost of clothing in 1880 was Rs. 2,649-13-6, against Rs. 3,753-4 in 1879. The reduction was most marked in Patna and Dullunda, where differences of Rs. 718-13-6 and Rs. 376-13-3 respectively, are to be observed. Here again the charge for raw materials only materially influenced the decrease. Almost the same expenditure as before was incurred at Dacca, where clothing was locally purchased, and a slight increase at Cuttack and Berhampore, the increase being due to a larger number of blankets purchased during the year. 64. Bazar medicines on the whole exhibit a reduction of one pie per head in 1879. 65. There was a total outlay of Rs. 4,459-10-11 in 1880, against Rs. 4,882-3-9 in 1879, on account of contingent expenditure. At Dullunda there was almost the same expenditure as in 187916 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 66.

The value of articles sold in the asylums amounted to Rs. 19,285 in 1880, against Rs. 26,275 in 1879; and the value of articles made over for asylum use was Rs. 10,918, against Rs. 12,375 in 1879. The amount expended for raw materials and other charges was Rs. 23,445 in 1880, against Rs. 28,479 in 1879. The profits from manufacturing sale proceeds amounted to Rs. 7,486 in 1880, against Rs. 9,578 in the previous year. The difference was due to the cost of raw materials only being charged in the asylum accounts, instead of the value of manufactured goods reckoned at the market rate, as also to the fact of less demand for manufactured goods outside the asylum. In Dullunda the amount of profit exhibits a further decrease on that of 1879 by Rs. 665. This reduction is apparent but not real, for the transactions of 1880 returned actually an increased profit over that of the previous year. In 1879 the value of articles made over for asylum use was Rs. 8,818 on account of diet, clothing, &c., being the price calculated at the market value of the manufactured goods. In the year under review the amount shown under these heads is Rs. 6,705, or Rs. 2,113 less than that of 1879, being the amount actually expended in production ; and if this difference be added to the profit shown in 1880, the amount will be Rs. 3,161, which would have been exhibited in the accounts if the system of money credits in force in 1879 had continued in 1880, the daily average population differing very slightly in the two years.

The asylum had the services of an overseer for the entire year 1880, but for a portion only of 1879. This added Rs. 757 to the item in 1880. There was some little increase in the charges for diet and private servants for first class paying-patients. The decrease in the higher class of paying-patients continues. The average cost of dieting the patients, which includes all extras and stimulants, was daily as follows:APPENDIX.

Dr. Payne also refers to unnecessary admis- sions caused by the action of Magistrates who committed to the asylums, as unfit to make their defence, persons charged with the commission of crime under the passing delirium of intoxication, who, on their admission, were at once returned as fit to take their trial. These cases, however, it is to be remarked, would not affect the numbers remaining in confinement at the close of the year. The last two years show a considerable number (15 and 13 respectively as against 8, 7 and 6 in the three previous years) re-admitted after trial. These, however, are bond fide additions to the number of criminal lunatics actually in confinement. On the whole, the Lieutenant-Governor is inclined to look upon the progressive increase as actual, and, having regard to the increase in the short period of 10 years, he thinks it doubtful whether we have yet reached the limit. Dr. Payne proposes to endeavour to collect information regarding the crimes charged against the lunatics committed to asylums during the past few years. The Lieutenant-Governor will await this statement with interest. 4. The total number of persons treated for insanity during the year was 1,104. For acute mania 188 were treated against 239 in 1879, with 15.42 per cent of recoveries against 18.82. These figures point to increased caution in the commitment of persons to asylums. It is particularly noteworthy that among the ganja-smokers admitted there has been a marked decrease in the number of cases of temporary intoxication. Of 89 persons of this class admitted in 1878, no less than 61 recovered; 41 recovered out of 58 admitted in 1879, while in 1880 only 31 out of 65 cases admitted resulted in recovery. The number of cases of chronic mania treated was 450 against 459 in 1879, and the percentage of recoveries was 3.33 compared with 5.22. Melancholia, a peculiarly intractable form of insanity, shows only 2 recoveries out of 81 cases treated. Acute dementia shows 6.34 per cent of recoveries against 1.75 in 1879, and chronic dementia 3.06 per cent against 1.43. Dr. Payne justly points out that general statistics of the results of treatment in all the cases under observation at a number of different asylums cannot be satis- factory. Differences of nomenclature, and the combination of all cases, new and old, in one total, render the figures quite unreliable for scientific purposes. It would be more satisfactory to know the results of new cases only under the different heads in each asylum separately. 5. There were 516 persons under treatment in hospital for sickness during the year. Of these, 485 were admitted during the year, and 31 were in hospital when the year began. The number of cases treated was 784 in 1880 and 543 in 1879. The daily average number under treatment in hospital was 40.6 in 1880 against 38.6 in 1879 and 60 in 1878. The daily average number of out-patients was 79. The statistics of out-patients have only been recorded since the orders of Government on the report for 1879 were issued. As they include cases of persons who have to be forcibly fed, convalescents, and even habitual idlers, it will be sufficient if they are given separately and not amalgamated with the hospital returns. Of the principal diseases, anæmia shows a decrease from 60 to 47 cases, and fevers a decrease from 169 to 123. In diarrh( 3 ) 6. Dr. Payne submits a very thorough and interesting examination of the statistics of mortality in the different asylums during the year. The death-rate per cent fell from 14.7 in 1879 to 12.3 in 1880. The average of the ten previous years was 11.5. There was a decrease in the number of deaths from 42 to 38 at Dullunda, from 20 to 10 at Dacca, and from 22 to 15 at Berhampore, while there was a rise from 35 to 42 at Patna and from 3 to 4 at Cuttack. In the report for 1879, allusion was made to the influence of the distribution of the lunatics from the abandoned asylum of Haza- ribagh on the mortality at the other asylums. The disease conveyed from this asylum was still fatal during 1880. Of the 163 persons received from Hazaribagh, 25 died in the nine months of 1879 following their transfer, and 22 died in 1880. Of the 22 who died in 1880, it is reported that only one was in good health on admission. In estimating the significance of the mortality at the different asylums, it is important to bear in mind the influence of newly admitted cases. It is established that mortality is much greater among newly admitted patients than among old residents. In Dullunda the percentages were 21 and 12 respectively, in Patna 23 and 12, and in Dacca 14 and 2½. As the number of persons admitted to Dullunda and Patna is much larger than the number admitted to any other asylum, a greater number of deaths is to be expected. It is quite clear that diet had no connec- tion with the mortality. In Dullunda meat rations were introduced with no effect whatever on sickness. In Patna, where the scale was unaltered, mortality increased. In Dacca, where one-third of the animal food was re-placed by vegetables, the mortality decreased. The condition of the water- supply at Patna and Berhampore will be enquired into under the Surgeon- General's orders. Beyond this no evidence can be discovered of special unhealthiness in the local conditions at any asylum. A detailed examination of the deaths under the different heads leaves no doubt that the mortality was largely affected by importation of disease from outside. Of 6 persons who died from ague and its consequences, 3 were new admissions. From anæmia, anasarca, debility and dropsy, 14 died in 1880 against 16 in 1879. Of the 14, just half were new admissions. Of 3 persons who died from remittent fever, 2 were new-comers who were admitted into hospital on arrival. There were 23 recorded deaths from phthisis against 21 in 1879. At Dullunda there occurred 11, at Dacca 1, at Patna 9, at Cuttack 2. Of the 11 who died at Dullunda 3 were new-comers, 4 were from Hazaribagh where phthisis had markedly developed before the asylum was closed, and 4 were chronic invalids. Only one case could be shown to have originated locally. Of the 9 who died at Patna, 5 were from Hazaribagh, and all were noted as received in weak condition. Of the two who died at Cuttack, one had been recently admitted. In addition to these circumstances, Dr. Payne shows that, as the post-mortem examinations are more regularly made, the Asylum authorities are enabled to determine as phthisis a larger and larger number of cases which, had examination not been held, might have been ascribed to other causes. Post- mortem examinations are now made in every case in which no objection is raised by the relatives of the deceased lunatic. It is certain that, under this practice, the number of phthisis cases will, as a rule, appear large in comparison with that reported in former years, while there will probably be a corresponding reduction under the heads of anæmia and debility. Thus while the number of deaths recorded under phthisis at Patna rose from 2 to 9, the number recorded under debility fell from 5 to 2. On the whole, it seems quite clear that, while lunatics generally are known to be liable to phthisis, there is no reason to believe that the condition of any of the Bengal asylums contribute specially to the promotion of this disease. 7. The total expenditure on the asylums during the year was Rs. 81,412-6-11 with a daily average of 881.74 inmates. The net expenditure, after deduction of Rs. 1,524-12-8, realized from friends of patients, and Rs. 7,486-13-3, the actual profit on manufactures, was Rs. 72,400-13. In 1879 the gross expendi- ture, with a daily average of 889.96, was Rs. 96,648-9-2, and the net expendi- ture Rs. 85,319-7-7. It is to be observed, however, that the gross figures include the value of articles received from asylum manufactures and consumed in the asylum. This has been differently calculated in the two years. In 1879 it was taken as the cost price of the actuals plus the value added to them in the process of manufacture. In accordance, however, with the orders issued
( 4 ) on the report for 1879, the value is now taken to be the cost price only. Thus the gross cost in 1879 appears unduly large. It includes Rs. 12,375 on account of goods consumed in the asylums, while the figure for 1880 includes Rs. 10,918-11-1 only. The gross average cost is shown as Rs. 92-5-3 in 1880 against Rs. 108-9-6 in 1879 : the net cost was Rs. 82-1-8 against Rs. 95-15-8. 8. The average cost on account of establishment was Rs. 48-4-10 against Rs. 51-0-3 in 1879. The reduction was chiefly due to the circumstance that the Superintendent's salary was charged throughout the year at the reduced rate of Rs. 273 per mensem, instead of partly at that rate, and partly at the rate of Rs. 609 drawn by Dr. Payne before he became Surgeon-General. The cost of establishment in each asylum was( 5 ) Rs. 10,918, against Rs. 12,375, the value admitted in 1879. The net profits were Rs. 7,486, against Rs. 9,578, the amount shown in favour of the previous year. The change in the practice of giving credit for goods consumed in the asylum caused apparent inequalities in the profits earned. Thus Dullunda and Patna, which consumed a large quantity of their own manufactures, and took credit only for the cost of the raw material, show a small profit. Dacca produced a smaller quantity, but it sold the greater part of it, and, getting the market value, it shows a much larger profit. 12. There were 26 admissions and re-admissions to the European Insane Asylum at Bhowanipore. Two of the new patients were from the army, one was a military pensioner, and the remainder came from the civil and seafaring classes. The total number treated was 46 against 40 in the previous year. Six were discharged cured, three were made over to the Military authorities, one was despatched to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, ten were improved and transferred to the care of their friends, and two died. There remained 24 at the close of the year. Of the two deaths, one resulted from organic disease of the brain, and the other from disease of the heart. The patients were both admitted in a hopeless condition. The general health of the asylum was good. The total expenditure during the year was Rs. 20,475 against Rs. 22,095. Here, as at Dullunda, the decrease in the salary of the Superintendent made a large reduction in the total cost. The average cost of dieting the patients ranged from Rs. 1-8-6 for first class, and 6 annas for third class, paying patients to 4 annas 5 pies for pauper patients. The amount recovered from the friends of the patients was Rs. 12,341. The average cost of maintenance, after deduction of this amount, was Rs. 370. 13. The Lieutenant-Governor is gratified to find that the Superintendents bear unanimous testimony to the good conduct of the subordinate officers and to their kind treatment of the lunatics, European and Native. This coincides with what Sir Ashley Eden has himself observed on his visits to the different asylums. The management of the asylums by the superior officers has been satisfactory, and the thanks of Government are due to Dr. Payne for his efficient control of the Department, and for the excellent report in which he has reviewed the administration of the year.

The percentage of recoveries in 1881, reckoned on the mean daily- population, was 10.68 against 8.27 in 1880, and 16.27, the average of the previous ten years, including the year 1880. The increase over 1880 is explained by the increased number of cases of acute mania, and the proportion of recoveries among them, shewn in the 7th and 8th tables. The decrease from the average is explained by the greatly reduced admissions of the later years. Calculated on absolute numbers admitted, the proportion of recoveries and improved cases in 1881 was larger, not only than that of 1880, but also than the decennial average, the proportion of acute or curable cases among the admissions of 1881 overpowering the effect of a diminished total. 9. I refrain from comment on the following table, which is, as I have said before, fallacious. Its quality may be plainly seen by comparing the figures of the two last years. TABLE No. 3.

The same may be done elsewhere if necessary. There is no scarcity of space in any asylum. 11.

6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13. The figures are open to the obvious objection that they represent, not cases of genuine insanity but, cases in which insanity has been successfully pleaded in court, and they include also the very numerous cases of crime com- mitted under mere intoxication. The importance of the distinction is seen in the number of persons who are received into asylums without a trace of insanity upon them. 14. The latter half of the decade, during which period the restrictive orders were in force, shews a total increase of admissions over the former half from 393 to 432. This difference is of itself not very significant. During the two last years of the decade some petty cases were committed to asylums which would not formerly have been so treated, and the subject attracted the notice of Government. The graver crimes recorded in the first five columns of the table rose from 191 in the first period to 215 in the last. These crimes, however, can scarcely be said to have any connection with lunatics knowingly left at large. They are committed for the most part under the influence of intoxicating drugs and by persons whose condition would, as soon as it became known, lead to their being confined somewhere. The increase here shown stands, therefore, in no relation to recent change of practice. The offences which may be expected to result more directly from the condition of persons affected by the orders, such as attempt at suicide, theft, trespass, mischief by fire, show no material differences in the two periods. The vaguer charges of drunkenness, bad behaviour, bad livelihood, and nuisance, though more frequent in the later period, do not present themselves in sufficient numbers to justify any conclusion. On the whole, it does not appear to me that, so far as the evidence of this record goes, the restriction on commitment to asylums has led to any appreciable increase of crime. The course of events set forth in the table is, I venture to think, more uniform than would be expected in a statement concerning which it must be admitted that the causes of possible variation are many.

The form of insanity ascribed to spirit drinking is more persistent. With 13 admissions there were only three recoveries in 1881. 19. Sickness.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 Dr. Bird, considering the water to be good, returned to the use of it. From August last Dr. Shaw obtained from outside a supply of the best water pro- curable. At Berhampore the Superintendent reports that he effected much improvement in the water-supply without waiting for his filter. The distribu- tion of bowel diseases during the several months of the year here indicates success of the measures adopted, and promises well at Berhampore, but not at Patna. There is at present, however, no more than indication, for the same disorders were less prevalent in the jails of both places in 1881. The course of dysentery in 1881 was generally favourable. The number of cases at the Presidency, though not large, was not satisfactorily small. The supply of water for bathing has of late, during the dry months, been insufficient to admit of the shower bath being fully utilised, and tank-bathing has been unavoidable. Fevers and their consequences did not prevail at the Presidency or at Berhampore, but at Dacca they showed some increase, and more at Patna. This is readily explained, at least in the latter case, by the state of the public health. Pneumonia shewed itself principally at Dacca, but it was not very fatal. Phthisis shows in the aggregate a small increase. At Dullunda the disease fell to an ordinary quantity, from the larger quantities of the two previous years. At Dacca the quantity was ordinary. At Patna there was large increase, and at Cuttack and Berhampore the quantity, though small, was moving upwards. The prevalence of this disease was very fully discussed in the last report. The anticipation of increase in the Patna Asylum has been fulfilled. An important point in the argument was the importation of phthisis from Hazari- bagh. The influence of this has now ceased to be felt at the Presidency, but not altogether at Patna. The number of cases here was too large to be considered normal, even though all that occurred were now for the first time recorded. Their origin has been examined with the following result. Of the 21 cases, two came from Hazaribagh, one other was admitted with confirmed phthisis, 12 with incipient phthisis. The rest appeared to be in fair health on admission. 21. The following statement shews the prevalence of the above-mentioned disorders in the jails adjacent to the asylums:10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. In the Dacca Jail anæmia and debility increased slightly. In the asylum they decreased. Cholera was absent from both jail and asylum. DiarrhLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 The condition of 1881 was ordinary. The increase of bowel disorders and the very great increase of cholera were not represented in the asylum. At Dacca fevers were more fatal in the town, but there was only one death in the asylum. Bowel complaints were more fatal in the town, but did not vary in the asylum. Cholera increased also in the town, but was absent from the asylum. At Patna fevers were very fatal in the town, and in the asylum 3 deaths took place. Bowel complaints were more fatal in town and less in the asylum. Cholera caused more deaths than before in the town, and none in the asylum. At Cuttack the town shewed no important variations. There was some increase of cholera. 24. Regarding the death-rates of particular asylums, it will be observed that in this, as in former years, the mortality, both absolute and proportional, has been much higher at the Presidency and Patna. The general causes of this were fully set forth last year, viz., the number of annual admissions and the condition in which lunatics are received. The effect of the last point is not measured by the numbers of those who die shortly after admission. It deter- mines largely the condition of the inmates as a whole and the general death- rates. Thus, at Dullunda there were 80 admissions in the year and 33 deaths. Of these, 11 were among recent admissions, and all of these 11 brought to the asylum the illness that was fatal. In all, 16 of the fatal cases dated from admission, though in some ill health took a longer and a fluctuating course. Of the cases of fatal phthisis, all but one were ill from admission. Of the entire number admitted in 1881, only 48 were noted as in good physical health at the time. At Patna there were, in all, 52 admissions and 30 deaths. Of the 52 persons admitted, 12 only were received in good health. Of the 30 persons who died, it is recorded of only two that they were in good health on admission. Of the 16 deaths from phthisis, it is said that not one was that of a person received in good health. Four, however, had lived more than 29 years in the place, one eight, and one six years. It seems clear, concerning six others, that they brought the disease with them to the asylum and died after short periods. All that need be said of this disease has already been said in discussing the number of cases; for this, and not the number of deaths, is the point for enquiry. With phthisis death is, in the aggregate, a mere question of time. At Dacca there were 46 admissions and re-admissions and 10 deaths; of 42 primary admissions the health on admission of 26 was noted as good, of 15 as indifferent, and of one as bad. Of the 10 persons who died, four were said to have been in good, and 2 in fair, health on admission. Two only of the 10 died within a year of admission, one of them within a few days, being ill throughout. At Cuttack there were 16 admissions in all, among which 7 persons are said to have been in good health, 6 were feeble, and 3 were ill. Of the six who died, the health on admission is reported as good in two cases, and indifferent in the rest. At Berhampore there were 19 admissions and re-admissions, and 13 are noted as having been in good health on arrival. Of the five persons who died two are noted as in fair health on admission. 25. The relation of death to recent admission appears as follows:12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. But as mania is the most fatal of mental diseases, so also is it the affection most frequently followed by recovery. If, therefore, the prevalence of this condition be accepted as an explanation of comparative mortality, the argument requires that comparative recoveries shall correspond with the above totals, and excluding persons " not insane " we have at the Presidency 49 recoveries in 1881 ; at Dacca, five; at Patna, 13. This portion of the argument is evidently not wanting. I omit from this reckoning the asylums of Berhampore and Cuttack, having already, and for other reasons, ascribed the proportions of maniacs in them to peculiarity of nomenclature. The scarcity of death and recovery in both places strengthens this view, whereas at Dacca this same scarcity is in accordance with the small quantity of mania. 27. Accidents and Injuries.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 Ordinary expenditure includes the usual charges on account of establish- ment, diet, clothing, and contingencies hitherto presented in the statements submitted to Government, and the value of articles made over for asylum use for the same purpose. The extraordinary charges include the expenditure for which no payment was made from, nor any account kept in, the asylums. These, however, properly belong to asylum expenditure and have therefore been included in total expenditure. The charges, especially the money expended on buildings are not of regular occurrence, and comparison of one year with another has no meaning. 30. The gross expenditure of the asylums amounted to Rs. 93,783 in 1881, against Rs. 90,019 in 1880, showing an increase of Rs. 3,764. The increase was confined to extraordinary items. Building charges, which were Rs. 7,329 in 1880, amounted to Rs. 15,328 in 1881. The cost of medical stores rose from Rs. 362 in 1880 to Rs. 570 in the year under report. The increase occurred at Dullunda, where old air-beds had to be replaced with new ones, which are costly articles. The ordinary charges show a reduction of Rs. 3,757 on those of 1880, and Rs. 18,994 on those of 1879. The large difference in 1879 was chiefly due to the fact that in 1880 and 1881 the manu- factured goods made over to asylums were valued at the cost of production, whereas in the preceding years the full value of the goods, calculated on the market rate, had been shown in the accounts. The fall in the price of food articles has contributed to the reduction. The average cost of each patient, including all charges, was Rs. 107-12-3, against Rs. 102-1-5 in 1880. Excluding the extraordinary charges the cost was Rs. 88-12-6, against Rs. 92-5-3. Deducting from the total expenditure the actual profits from manufactures and the money realized from paying-patients, the cost per man was Rs. 96-13-9, against Rs. 91-13-11. The expenditure under the several heads is detailed below. 31. Establishment.14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. numbers of inmates in confinement in the past year.

MEDIACL. DARJEELING, THE 26TH MAY 1882. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) to asylums by judicial officers, and he promised to submit a statement of the crimes with which criminal lunatics committed to lunatic asylums were charged. A very elaborate and interesting table has been submitted with the present report, showing the offences with which the criminal lunatics, who were admitted into the asylum between 1871 and 1880, were charged. The returns do not show any marked increase in the number of lunatics committed for any specific offence, though the total admissions and re-admissions increased gradually between 1877 and 1880. In the past year, however, there was a slight decrease. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Surgeon-General in considering that the return does not show that the restrictive orders of Government have had any effect on petty crime. On the other hand the return of the criminal lunatics in all the asylums shows again a slight increase in the number remain- ing in confinement at the end of the year, and supports the view taken by the Lieutenant-Governor in the previous year, that the progressive increase in the number of criminal lunatics was actual and had not yet reached the limit, and that it was not merely an apparent increase, caused by the action of Magistrates in sending to asylums as lunatics criminals who were at once sent back to take their trial. 5. The total number of persons treated for insanity during the past year was 1,094 as compared with 1,104 in 1880, and 1,187 in the preceding year. The total number of recoveries was 93 against 73 in 1880, and the number of cases in which there was an improvement was 41 against 34 in the preceding year. The percentage of recoveries on the total number treated for the different kinds of insanity was as follows:( 3 ) remembered that there are cases in which resort to intoxicants is only one of the first symptoms of mental unsoundness, and, though symptoms may be immediately produced by the drug or the alcohol used, the true cause of insanity is antecedent, and the disease genuine." 6. There were 32 patients in hospital at the beginning of the year, and during it there were 385 admissions, the total number treated being 417. There has been a gradual and satisfactory improvement in the health of the lunatics during the last four years. The number treated in 1878 was 784, and it fell to 543 and 516 in 1879 and 1880 respectively. The daily average number of patients in hospital was 34.93 as compared with 40.6 in the preceding year. The average number of out-patients also fell from 79.02 to 61.06. There was a great decrease in the number of cases of anæmia and debility, the number having fallen from 60 in 1879 and 47 in 1880 to 25 during the past year. In the Patna Asylum the number fell from 24 to 9. In his report for 1880, Dr. Payne remarked "it is probable that under the regular practice of post-mortem examinations, the vague names of debility and anæmia will appear less frequently in asylum returns." The results as shown in the returns for the past year have been in accordance with the Surgeon-General's anticipations. During 1880 there were 12 cases of cholera in the asylums, 9 of the cases having occurred in the Berhampore Asylum and the other 3 in the Patna Asylum. During the past year there was not a single case of cholera. There were also, during 1880, 36 cases of diarrh( 4 ) maniacs, there were 33 deaths; in the Patna Asylum, with 280 inmates and 161 maniacs, there were 30 deaths; while in Dacca, though the number of inmates was 226, the number of maniacs was only 88, and the deaths only reached the number of 10. 8. During the past year the expenditure amounted to Rs. 93,783. The total cost during the year 1880 was, as stated in the report for that year, Rs. 81,412-6-11. In comparing the amount of expenditure in the two years it must, however, be borne in mind that the expenditure for 1880 as shewn did not include the expenditure under certain heads of extraordinary outlay which are included in the accounts of the past year. Under the head of extraordinary expenditure were included in 1880 the amount spent on (1) the charges on account of work done by the Public Works Department; (2) the rates and taxes on buildings attached to asylums; (3) the cost of printed forms and stationery, and (4) the cost of European medicines. The total outlay under these heads in 1880 was Rs. 8,605-10-1, and this amount added to the expenditure shewn in the statements which had at that time received the sanc- tion of Government amounted to Rs. 90,018-1-0. After omission of fractions of rupees, the expenditure for the two past years on account of ordinary and extraordinary charges stands as follows:( 5 ) keepers, one female keeper, and the baker have been dispensed with, while the pay of the carpenter has been reduced from Rs. 30 to Rs. 24, and that of the bhistee, who drew Rs. 10, to Rs. 8. In consequence of these changes the expenditure on establishment proper in the Dullunda Asylum was reduced by Rs. 418. 10. The following table shows the actual profits in the various asylums in 1880-81:( 6 ) class was, as in the case of the other asylums, lower than in 1880. The amount recovered on account of paying patients, and remitted to the treasury, was Rs. 11,794 as compared with Rs. 8,987 in 1880. 14. The report is very full and satisfactory, and shows that the different asylums have been well managed by the officials and efficiently supervised by the superior officers. With the exception of one case at Dacca, where an overseer was dismissed for gross misconduct, the work of the subordinates at all the establishments has been favourably noticed. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to be able to recognize the continued successful administration of the Depart- ment during the past year.

The proportion of recoveries calculated on average strength was some- what below that of 1881, which was 10.6 per cent. Difference was largest among females. It is explained by reduced admission under the head of acute mania, for among the acute maniacs who were present in the asylums, the proportion was rather above than below the previous year (vide table 8). In the propor- tion on total numbers treated there is a similar fall, but the proportion on admissions is practically unaltered and is high, notwithstanding the greater scarcity of cases entered as acute mania.

There is nothing, therefore, in the change which can be said to contravene the conclusion given in the last report as to increase of crime among insane persons at large. TABLE No 6.

The higher salary of the Deputy Superintendent and matron add to the charge for superintendence in this asylum. There was some reduction of establishment proper in 1882. The reductions noted at the foot of statement No. X in 1881 were maintained and, in addition, a cook and a female warder were discharged. Nevertheless, the average cost under this head shows a trifling increase, the balance of the effect of smaller numbers over the amount saved. At Dacca the establish- ment was revised in May 1882. The cost of superintendence rises slightly, and some reduction in establishment proper is seen. Probably the latter will not be maintained, as the pay of the warders has been found insufficient. At Patna the trifling decrease was due to fines, &c. At Cuttack there was no change worthy of notice. At Berhampore a slight decrease in superintendence and increase in establishment proper resulted from some increase in the number of lunatics requiring additional servants, the former being made less than it would otherwise have been by increase of pay to the overseer. The charges under both heads for the two years stand as follows :10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The total cost of diet in 1882 was Rs. 27,402, against Rs. 27,915 in 1881. The value of manufactured articles supplied by the asylums themselves at the cost of production was 8,142, against Rs. 8,761.

DARJEELING, THE 16TH APRIL 1883. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) chronic, is somewhat too great in Patna and somewhat too small at Berhampore. 3. The number of lunatics confined in the several asylums was always below the capacity of the buildings calculated at the rate of 50 superficial feet for each lunatic, except for limited periods at Dacca and Cuttack. It has been explained in previous reports that there is no real overcrowding in either of these institutions, as harmless lunatics are allowed to sleep in the verandahs, which are not included in the estimate of capacity. The following table shows the number and disposal of criminal lunatics in the asylums in Bengal during the last 11 years:( 3 ) 5. The health of the asylums was generally good in 1882. The daily average of lunatics in hospital, calculated on the mean strength of the popula- tions of the asylums, was 3.58 per cent. against 4.01 in the previous year, while the mean daily number of out-patients fell from 61 to 47. The following table shows the prevalence of the principal diseases in 1882:( 4 ) The gross expenditure fell from Rs. 93,783 in 1881 to Rs. 81,633 in the year under review. Of the decrease, which amounted to Rs. 12,150, Rs. 2,084 occurred under ordinary, and Rs. 10,066 under extraordinary expen- diture. The principal part of the reduction was under building charges, which fell from Rs. 15,388 in 1881 to Rs. 5,565 in 1882. The total cost per patient was Rs. 94 in 1882 against Rs. 107 in the previous year. The ordinary charges per patient amounted to Rs. 87 against Rs. 88, and the net cost of each person, after deducting receipts from paying patients and the net profits from manufactures, was Rs. 82 against Rs. 96. 8. Under the head of establishment, the total expenditure amounted to Rs. 39,702 against Rs. 41,725 in the previous year, the average cost per patient being Rs. 45 against Rs. 47. In the Dullunda Asylum the charge for superin- tendence fell from Rs. 33 to Rs. 26, the reduction being due to the arrangement by which the charge of the asylum was transferred to the First Resident Surgeon, General Hospital, from June 1882. Some reductions were also made in the minor establishment, which were partly neutralized by the higher salaries granted to the Deputy Superintendent and the Matron. The fluctua- tions in the other asylums, which were comparatively small, were due principally to alterations in the details of establishments. 9. The question of the cost of diet received considerable attention during the year. The Government of India drew attention to the high cost of diet in the Dullunda and Dacca Asylums as compared with the charges in the neighbouring jails. On enquiry, however, it was ascertained that the excess was more apparent than real. Several items, such as hospital expenses, which were included in the figures of cost in the case of asylums, were shown separately in the case of jails, while the nominal outlay in the latter institutions was still further kept down by dint of supplying the prisoners with vegetables from the jail gardens, and with other articles of food prepared by the inmates, a resource that is only possible to a very limited extent in lunatic asylums. Some minor economies have, however, been found possible, and the diet-scale at Dacca has been revised and assimilated to that in force at Dullunda. The cost per head of diet has been slightly reduced in these two asylums, as will appear from the following table:( 5 ) 12. The number of patients in the Bhowanipore European Asylum at the beginning of the year was 20, viz. 7 males and 13 females. During the year, 17 persons were admitted, of whom 3 were re-admitted after discharge. The total number of persons under treatment was therefore 40. Of the new admis- sions 10 were Europeans, natives of Great Britain, one a Russian, and 6 Eura- sians. Four lunatics were discharged cured, four were deported to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, three were transferred to the care of friends, and two died. Twenty-seven persons remained in the asylum at the close of the year. The Surgeon-General reports that, as in former years, the female ward was overcrowded, and admission had to be refused to several applicants. The state of the law relating to admissions to the Bhowanipore Asylum, and the powers of Government for the deportation to Europe of lunatics of European birth, have received the attention of Government, and the Surgeon-General has been requested to submit a full report on the whole question, with a view to removing the inconvenience that is now felt. 13. There were only two deaths in the asylum in 1882, against seven in the previous year. One man was admitted in a state of furious phrenzy, and was with difficulty kept alive for 46 days, after which period he died from exhaustion. The other was the case of a man who was sent from Assam, suffering from fever, and who ultimately died of phthisis. The total expen- diture amounted to Rs. 21,136 against Rs. 22,160 in 1881. There was an increase in the average cost of diets which is explained by the large number of patients who were admitted into the asylum in a weak and emaciated con- dition, and had to be kept up by extra quantities of food. The total amount contributed by the friends of paying patients was Rs. 14,786 against Rs. 15,280 in 1881, and the average net cost of each lunatic to the State was Rs. 276. 14. The management of the asylums throughout the province during the year was excellent, and reflects credit on the Superintendents and on the head of the department. The members of the subordinate staff are all well spoken of by their immediate superiors. Mr. and Mrs. DeVere, the Deputy Seperinten- dent and Matron of the Bhowanipore Asylum, maintained the high reputation for efficiency they had won in former years, ORDER.ANNUAL REPORT ON THE INSANE ASYLUMS IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1883.

The proportion of recoveries calculated on average strength is slightly better than that recorded last year, but the difference is not so great as would be expected from the details of admission. In fact the deaths and recoveries in 1883 are both somewhat at variance with the details of admission set down in table 7. In my comments on that table I shall offer an explanation of this, which may also explain the inverted order of figures in the first and last columns of table 2. TABLE No. 3.

As in former years, the inmates at Dacca and Cuttack have, at times, exceeded the number for which a very liberal estimate of space provides. No inconvenience is felt anywhere. That the increase of excess in 1883 over that of 1882 is insignificant, is seen in the greater and altogether exceptional healthiness of the institutions in the later year.

Increase of criminal lunatics continues. Admissions were more nu- merous by 16 than in 1882, and re admissions rose slightly. Discharges increased from 41 to 50, and deaths fell from 25 to 14. There resulted at the end of the year, an increase of 41 in the number in confinement 11. In the report for 1881 a statement was given, which had been prepared for the purpose of enquiring whether there had been any increase of crime among lunatics at large which might be attributed to the operation of orders restricting admission to asylums. The inference was that there was no such increase. In 1882 this inference was strengthened, as the admissions seemed to be showing nothing more than a natural fluctuation, and the enquiry was not pursued. In the resolution on the report the Lieutenant-Governor expressed a wish that the table should be continued, a course which the events of 1883 would have rendered necessary even if it had not been ordered.

6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 12. The total number for 1883 was 93. It should, as pointed out in the report for 1881, be borne in mind that the figures represent cases in which insanity has been successfully pleaded in court, as distinguished from cases of genuine insanity. 13. The total number has once been equalled (nearly) since 1879, when the restrictive orders came into force, and was once considerably exceeded (1876) before they were issued. The first columns of the table, showing com- mitment for graver crimes, present numbers which were all exceeded in the earlier years, except the second; but these are not the crimes of which the record would probably be affected by the change of practice. The result, if there were any, would probably appear under the heads of theft, trespass, suicide, mischief, bad behaviour, bad livelihood, &c., and these do not increase either relatively to the whole, or absolutely in such manner as to support any imputation against the existing rules of admission to asylums :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 7 be said to afford only a general classification. In 1883 changes in the superin- tendence of asylums were unusually frequent, and I conclude, from the entire course of events in that year, that the changes affected the nomenclature of disease. Thus there were 92 new cases of acute mania, and a total number of 232 cases treated with 48 cases of recovery and improvement with discharge. In 1882 there were 69 admissions and a total of 200 cases with 47 cases dis- charged. Going back to 1881, we find again 99 admissions and 213 cases in total, with 55 of recovery and improvement. Recovery from acute mania within a year is frequent, and it is probable that if practice, as to nomenclature, had been the same in the two later years, the figures would have been some- what differently arranged. The same must be said of chronic mania. There is fluctuation in the proportion of recoveries which points to uncertainty of names. The matter cannot be fully examined without more detailed enquiry than is permissible in a report of this kind, which is concerned with administrative rather than technical points. I mention it as a probable explanation of figures which may appear anomalous in this and other tables. The death numbers also are at variance with the relative liabilities of the several groups. To ex- haustion of mania, which belongs mainly to the acute affection, one death only was ascribed in 1883 in all the asylums. TABLE 8.

The figures of this table cannot, for reasons stated before, be suffi- ciently accurate for statistical use. So far as they go, they strengthen the conclusions offered in the last paragraph. An increased number of recent cases of acute mania did not increase the rate of recovery in that class, reckoned on the entire number, as it might be expected to have done. 17.

A larger number of persons than usual were made over to the care of friends, as well as of persons despatched to Europe while still insane, under the merchant shipping act, or otherwise. The ratio per cent, of cures and transfers to total number treated was 41.18, against 27.5 in 1882.

Receipts from paying patients, including outstandings, reached Rs. 15,226 against Rs. 14,786 in 1882; outstandings, however, amounted to Rs. 3,280, the greater portion of which is due from Captain Andrews of the invalid establishment. His debt is now Rs. 2,633. The balance will, it is expected, be shortly realized. 40. Mr. and Mrs. De Vere continue to earn the confidence and respect of officers and patients alike. I ascribe it to Mr. De Vere's activity and deter- mination that persons well able to pay for their own maintenance have not been allowed to defraud the Government, and that the large sums, now annually paid into the treasury, have been realized. Mr. Lawton, the overseer, rendered valuable service during the year, and his wife acted very satisfactorily as matron during the absence on sick leave of Mrs. De Vere. The superintendence of the asylum underwent the same changes in 1883 as befel that of the Dullunda Asylum. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, A. J. PAYNE, M.D., Surgeon-General for Bengal.

DARJEELING, THE 6TH MAY 1884. RESOLUTION. READ- The Report on the Lunatic Asylums in Bengal for 1883. Read again... The Report for 1882, and the Resolution recorded upon it. The number of admissions into the asylums, which had fallen in 1882 to 165, the smallest number on record, rose to 209 during the year under review. The increase was most marked in the case of males, of whom 184 were admitted against 144 in the previous year, while the number of females admitted was 25 against 21 in 1882. Criminal lunatics contributed chiefly towards the increase. The number of re-admissions was the same as in the preceding year, viz. 23, with this difference that, whereas the number in 1882 was composed of 20 males and 3 females, the re-admissions in 1883 were of males only. The daily average population of the asylums was 878.67 against 867.12 in the previous year. The lunatics who remained in the asylums at the close of the year numbered 907, of whom 724 were males and 183 were females. 2. The total number of persons treated for insanity was 1,081, as com- pared with 1,056 in 1882, and 1,094 in the preceding year. The number of recoveries was 90 against 83 in 1882, but the number of cases in which there was an improvement fell from 34 to 27. The percentage of recoveries on the total number treated for the different kinds of insanity was, in the case of acute mania, 16.81, chronic mania 6.22, melancholia 4, acute dementia 5.71, and chronic dementia 1.43. The percentages are lower in every case than the corresponding proportions in the previous year, except in the case of chronic mania. These figures, however, are, as has been pointed out by the Surgeon- General on previous occasions, quite unreliable for scientific purposes, so long as complete uniformity does not exist in the various asylums in the diagnosis of different forms of mental disease. In his present Report, he writes:... " In my last Report I spoke of the uncertainty of nomenclature in the "hands of different superintendents, who are required to record all cases under "headings which can be said to afford only a general classification. In 1883 " changes in the superintendence of asylums were unusually frequent, and I '' conclude, from the entire course of events in that year, that the changes " affected the nomenclature of disease. Thus, there were 92 new cases of acute " mania, and a total number of 232 cases treated with 48 cases of recovery and " improvement with discharge. In 1882 there were 69 admissions and a total " of 200 cases with 47 cases discharged. Going back to 1881, we find again "99 admissions and 213 cases in total, with 55 of recovery and improvement. " Recovery from acute mania within a year is frequent, and it is probable that " if practice, as to nomenclature, had been the same in the two later years, " the figures would have been somewhat differently arranged. The same must " be said of chronic mania. There is fluctuation in the proportion of recoveries " which points to uncertainty of names." So much at least is certain, that, taking all kinds of insanity together, the percentage of recoveries on the total number of cases treated was higher in 1883 than in the previous year. 3. The number of inmates in the Dacca and Cuttack Asylums at times exceeded the nominal capacity of the wards, but there was no real overcrowding in either of these institutions, as harmless lunatics were allowed, as in previous years, to sleep in the verandahs, which are not included in the estimate of capacity of the buildings.
( 2 ) 4. The following table shows the number of criminal lunatics treated in the asylums during the last three years:( 3 ) In commenting on intoxication as a prevalent cause of insanity, the Surgeon-General makes the following appropriate remarks:( 4 ) 8. The following table shows the receipts and expenditure in each asylum during 1883 :( 5 ) constantly full and admission had to be refused to several applicants. The total expendi are amounted to Rs. 19,860 against Rs. 21,136 in 1882, the decrease being chiefly due to the transfer of the asylum to the charge of the Resident Surgeon, General Hospital, of which the effect was felt during the entire year. There was also a decrease in the average cost of diets as compared with the previous year, when a large number of patients had, under accidental circumstances, been admitted into the asylum in a weak and emaciated condi- tion, and had to be kept up by extra quantities of food. The average net cost to the State of each lunatic was Rs. 165. 11. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to acknowledge the care and attention bestowed by the Superintendents on the Asylums under their charge, and to find that they bear unanimous testimony to the good conduct of the subordinate officers. He appreciates the labours of Mr. and Mrs. DeVere, the Deputy Superintendent and Matron of the Bhowanipore Asylum. Mr. Lawton, the Overseer, and Mrs. Lawton, who acted as Matron during the absence, on sick leave, of Mrs. DeVere, are also well spoken of by the Surgeon-General. The management of the asylums throughout the Province during the year was excellent, and reflects credit on the Head of the Department.

If we take the proportion of the recoveries in 1884, calculated on admissions, the figures are the same as those of the previous year. The percentage of recoveries in the same twelve months, reckoned on the mean daily population, was 9.77 against 10.24 in 1883, and 12.47, the average of the previous ten years, including the year 1883. The decrease from the average hitherto has been explained by the reduction in the admis- sions, falling off in the " admissions under the head of acute mania," " un- certainty of nomenclature in the hands of different Superintendents," and to " changes in the Superintendents of Asylums," which " affected the nomenclature of diseases, " &c., &c. This is all very plausible, but I am not prepared to admit that such changes4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. TABLE No. 3. Average number of days patients discharged were confined. ASYLUMS. CURED.

From this table it appears that, both in the Dacca and Cuttack Asylums, the inmates in 1884, as in 1883, exceeded the estimated capacity of the build- ings. This excess is becoming a constant quantity. Verandahs were utilized. The use of verandahs for such a purpose, however, is not considered at the present day a prudent sanitary arrangement where the main wards are full of patients. It is apparent that these asylums require some additions being made to them:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 Statement showing the number of Criminal Lunatics admitted into the Asylums in Bengal during the last ten years, and the crimes charged.

6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15. The total number of fresh admissions of criminal lunatics for 1884 was 74, against 93 for 1883. The number was equalled in 1877, and nearly equalled in 1881. There is a close uniformity in some of the admissions throughout the decade, which is remarkable. The fluctuations in the crimes charged against lunatics in the decennial period are but slight. The commitments for grayer crimes decreased in 1884. It is gratifying to note that those crimes, associat- ed with an activity of the animal propensities, are barely represented. Probably a large proportion of the poor creatures who suffer from mental disease, with a strong tendency that way, die or, are confined out of harms way shortly after they reach the age of puberty.

This table can only be of any service as shewing the probable extent of particular forms of insanity among the classes from which the insanes come. When all classes are equally addicted to the use of intoxicants, the difficulty is to arrive at any satisfactory result; moreover, we have no data on which to base a just comparison. TABLE No. 7.

Here the rise was from 51 in 1883 to 136 in 1884, or a percentage to mean strength of from 22.99 to 59.77. Dullunda comes next on the list, giving an increase rising from 18. to 40.93. Patna shows an increase of 1.78, and Cuttack 2.95 only, while in Berhampore the rate per cent. of admissions to mean strength decreased from 32.25 to 20.48. The daily average number of sick rose considerably in Dullunda, more than doubled what it was in 1883, slightly in Dacca and Patna, but fell in Cuttack and Berhampore. TABLE No. 10.

The asylums are Government institutions, and are, it may be said, entirely maintained out of the public revenues. While economy has been judiciously exercised in the expenditure, the inmates have been well fed, well clothed, well housed, kindly and considerately treated, and those capable of work have been given light and healthful occupations. In a word, the asylums are con- ducted in the interests of the insane, every endeavour being made to ameliorate their unfortunate condition. 37. Finance.14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 38.

With the exception of Dacca, all the asylums showed diminished profit. At Dullunda the loss is explain- ed to have been due to the entire abolition of the castor-oil industry, which for years past was working at a loss, to the disposal of its plant and machinery, which resulted in a debit against the sale proceeds of the year, and to the indul- gences to lunatics of the manufacturing department. At Patna the loss is attribut- ed to the higher price of castor seeds, and to the diminution of sale of the castor- oil, the result of competition. The sale of other products, such as table covers, purdahs, sattringees, durries, and towels having also fallen off, the articles lying in store for many years had to be sold at reduced prices. The decrease at Berhampore is said to be due to the employment of a smaller number of lunatics on the different industries, to the cessation of profitable branches of manufacture for three months, for want of work-sheds which were blown down by a storm in May, to the expenditure of money towards the recon- struction of these sheds and repairs of the implements, and to the making over of manufactured goods of higher value for the purposes of the asylum than in former years. At Cuttack the diminution of profits is reported to be due to the wear and tear of tools and plant during the year, and to the purchase of raw materials at a higher rate than that of 1883, while the sale of the produce continued at the same rate as in the previous year. 46.

The average daily cost of diet per patient therefore in 1884 was Rs. 0-10-9 as against Rs. 0-9-8 in 1883. It is not possible to compare these figures with the expenditure in former years, as the outlay on stimulants which were " only used medicinally " were not always included in the reckoning, and nowhere itemized in the accounts. 54. The subjoined statement shows the average daily number of lunatics for 1884, the total yearly expenditure, average cost of each insane, and the average cost of each item of out-goings per individual during the year:APPENDIX.

MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 25TH AUGUST 1885. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) however, considers the use of the verandahs for this purpose to be objec- tionable on sanitary grounds when the main wards are full of patients, and suggests some additions being made to the asylums in question. The Lieutenant-Governor will await specific proposals on this point 4. The following statement shows the number and disposal of criminal lunatics treated in the asylums during the last three years:( 3 ) cases treated increased from 16 in 1883 to 72 in 1884. The adjoining jail and outside population are said to have suffered equally, while Dr. Crombie, the Superintendent, does not remember to have known such an unhealthy- season before. Cholera appeared only in the Dacca Asylum, where three cases were reported, of which two ended in death. 7. Cases of injury and accident, three of which proved fatal, occurred at Dullunda, Patna, and Berhampore. At Dullunda a lunatic struck another over the head, causing a fracture of the skull and a rupture of the brain. In Patna a patient tried to swallow a large piece of bread; it stuck in his throat and caused almost instant death. In the same asylum a patient tried to escape; he fell off a wall and broke his rib. At Berhampore the work-sheds were blown down during a violent storm, resulting in the death of one patient and the injury of seven others. The other cases reported are few in number, and are of comparatively trifling importance. 8. The number of deaths in 1884 was 87 against 52 in 1883. The increase in the mortality was principally occasioned by diarrh( 4 ) cost of a lunatic's daily food was one anna six pies against one anna and three pies in 1883. The charge for clothing fell from Rs. 2,836 in 1883 to Rs. 2,579 in 1884. 11. The amount expended on raw materials for manufacture was Rs 26,543; the value of raw materials, manufactured goods, and plant and machinery on 1st January 1884 was Rs. 61,523. The total debit thus stood at Rs. 88,066. On the other hand, the amount paid into the treasury was Rs. 15,967 ; manufactured goods to the value of Rs. 14,214 were consumed in the asylums, and the estimated value of the stores in stock when the year closed was Rs. 61,308, making a total credit of Rs. 91,489. The excess of credit over debit therefore amounted to Rs. 3,423, but after adjusting certain items shown in Statement XI appended to the report, the net profit on manufactures stood at Rs. 3,207 against Rs. 5,547 in the previous year. This decrease is attributed to the abolition of the castor-oil industry at Dullunda, the diminution in the sale of products at Patna, the employment of a smaller number of luna- tics, and the cessation of work for three months at Berhampore, and to the wear and tear of tools and plant, and the purchase of raw materials at a higher rate at Cuttack. As explained in previous years, the net profit of a year is no proper measure of success, the articles consumed in the asylums being charged at cost price, profit being allowed on outside sales only. 12. The number of patients at the beginning of the year in the Bhowanipore European Asylum, which is not considered in the foregoing paragraphs, was 29, viz. 15 males and 14 females. During the year 25 persons were admitted, of whom 19 were males and six females Of the 54 patients under treatment, three were discharged cured, three were made over to the Military authorities, 11 were sent to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act or otherwise, four were transferred to the care of friends, and two died. Of the two deaths, one was due to decay in a hard drinker, while the other resulted from acute mania in a woman Thirty- one persons remained in the asylum at the close of the year, of whom 14 were Europeans, 14 East Indians, and 3 Armenians. The female ward was as usual overcrowded, and admission had to be refused to several applicants. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 19,804 against Rs. 19,860 in 1883. The total amount contributed by the friends of paying patients was Rs. 14,414, and the average net cost of each lunatic to the State was Rs. 186. 13. The report is full and satisfactory, and shows that the different asylums have been well managed by the officials, and efficiently supervised by the superior officers. The management of the asylums also reflects credit on the head of the Medical Department. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, J. WARE EDGAR, Offg. Secretary to the Government of Bengal.

No. 3654. FROM A. J. COWIE, ESQ., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, MEDICAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 4th June 1886. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit my report on the condition and working of the lunatic asylums of Bengal for the year 1885 as follows. 2. Lunatics in confinement.2 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL.

On the several bases of reckoning, table 2 exhibits the proportions to per cent. of discharges :4 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. One important fallacy, as I pointed out last year, running through these figures for statistical purposes, is, the difficulty of separating first admissions from recurrent insanity. TABLE No. 3.

The estimated capacity of the buildings in the Dacca and Cuttack Asylums were exceeded during portions of the year 1885. Increased accom- modation in both these institutions is now under consideration. The need for additional space in Cuttack is apparent, and must be met by an addition to the building. All the inmates here are not forced to remain in the wards at night. A good many are permitted to occupy the verandah, and were the verandah calculated in the available sleeping space, the overcrowding disappears. In the Dacca Asylum it is proposed to re arrange the allotment of the insanes in the several buildings, which will, it is hoped, afford sufficient accommodation without incurring much expense.

LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 5 10. Criminal lunatics.6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. The total number of fresh admissions of criminal lunatics for 1885 was 93 against 74 in 1884. The number was equalled in 1883, and very nearly equalled in 1880, while it was considerably exceeded in 1876. The commit- ments for murder increased by 11 over those recorded in 1884. Crimes asso- ciated with an activity of the animal propensities are almost entirely absent from the return for 1885. TABLE No. 6. Showing the Religion and Sex of Patients admitted. HINDUS.

The totals of the communities from which the lunatics came are not given. Where a large proportion of the cases are the result of intoxication any sort of comparison is impossible, and if it could be made would be of no real interest. 13.

Forms of insanityLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 7 manifest, soon after birth, the signal form of idiocy due to a supposed miasmatic influence peculiarly affecting the growth of the bones of the skull: But such is not the case. Cretinism associated with goitre is entirely absent from all the returns. 16. The total deaths decreased from 87 in 1884 to 73 in 1885, or a return to the number entered in 1877, the lowest death record in the decen- nial period, save in 1883, when 52 persons only are said to have died. The total deaths increased from 52 in 1883 to 87 in 1884, or a return to the number set down in 1882, with an average strength of 867.12 as against 920.96 in 1884. With an average strength of 939.62, the total deaths were 73 in the year under report. The decrease chiefly took place among those suffering from acute mania, the numbers being 22 in 1884, while they were 11 only in 1885. There was a decrease of four deaths under the head of melancholia. 17. The rates per cent. of recoveries from the several forms of insanity on total numbers are shown in the following figures :8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. that the resort to drugs of this class is the cause and not the effect of the mental failure. It occurs to me, after a very considerable experience in the treat- ment of such cases, that the habit grows upon the individual, who has, as time goes on, to increase the dose to produce the desired effect, until the special object is no longer attainable, or until the gradually enlarged quantities indulged in result not only in a confirmed habit, but are quickly followed by insanity on the excess taken. I am more than borne out in this opinion, based as it is on a large experience in the treatment of the insanes, by the facts that women do not acquire the bhang ganja or churus habits, and for obvious reasons; and that, the majority of the cases admitted into our asylums suffering from first effects are young or middle-aged men. I do not mean to say that these drugs are never used, save for the above purpose. The exceptions, however, are so very rare that they may be said to prove the rule. Throughout the year one female only was admitted under the head of ganja Fever is said to have led to 7 cases of insanity, although the type is not given. Nine are set down to hereditary predisposition; 5 to epilepsy, and 1 to childbirth. Fur- ther than this it is needless to comment upon the figures recorded in this state- ment. TABLE No. 9. Dullunda.

Hereafter all Superintendents of asylums will be required to furnish statements shewing the total number of all classes of diseases treated throughout the year as out-patients, in their respective hospitals, and thus without laying down any precise rules for their guidance, restricting medical officers to any particular line of action, I hope to be in a position to analyse the in and out-patients' lists, possibly to some profit. 23. The following table exhibits the variations of the principal diseases in the jails neighbouring the asylums:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 11 being somewhat larger than among males. The chief fall took place in Dacca with a decrease of 16 deaths; Patna follows next with a decrease of 11 deaths ; while Cuttack shows 6 deaths, or just double the number recorded in 1884. The mortality rose, however, very considerably in the Dullunda Asylum, where 27 deaths were registered in 1885 against 18 in 1884. The deaths in the Berhampore Asylum varied but little in the two years, being 10 in 1885 against 9 in 1884. Dr. Murray states that in the Dullunda Asylum " a consider- able proportion of the deaths occurred at the beginning of the year, and consisted of old chronic hopeless cases that had been hanging on between life and death for a lengthened period." The largest decrease in the general mortality is in pulmonary disease. The deaths from phthisis during the year fell from 26 in 1884 to 11 in 1885, while the fatal cases of dysentery and diarrh12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 30. The total sum expended was Rs. 86,171 against Rs. 91,695 in 1884, or Rs. 5,524 less than that of the previous year. Ordinary and extraordinary expenditure are divided as follows:LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 13 The following table shows the expenditure under both heads for the two years:14 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 37. The average yearly cost of contingencies per man is shown in the following table :LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 15 Rs. 1,040-9-1, do not represent an actual loss, although they certainly appear to do so from the peculiar construction of the table. The calculation in column 19 is arrived at in accordance with the tabular footnote in the statement which Government has prescribed. I cannot understand the precise object of the footnote; it does not appear to me to be necessary, and is distinctly mis- leading. In the footnote, after the balance has been already struck in the body of the statement and shown in column 17, the debit balance is again a second time deducted, and the naturally resulting loss is entered in column 19. In the same way, if the difference in the value of raw materials and manufac- tured articles between the beginning and end of the year had been on the credit instead of on the debit side, this difference would have been added to the profits in column 17 instead of subtracted, and so a delusive profit would have been shown. This will explain the disproportionately high profits of some former years. In my annual report the sum of Rs. 417-5-4 was called " net " profit; it should have in terms of the prescribed form been called profit. In the year 1884 there was only a profit of Rs. 32-8 as shown in column 17 of statement XI for that year. The net loss according to the calculation on which the figures in column 19 are based was Rs. 87-6-2. Through an over- sight as I had just taken over charge of the asylum, I explained the loss as due to the failure of the castor-oil industry, indulgences to lunatics, &c. I ought to have attributed the small profits to these causes, as there was no actual loss. It will thus be seen that neither in 1884 nor in 1885 was there any actual loss sustained by the Manufacture Department. On the contrary, there was a profit each year, and in 1885 it was a pretty large sum, considering that articles to the value of Rs. 11,847-9-3 were made over for asylum purposes at the actual cost price, and indulgences were allowed to lunatics as a reward for good work to the value of Rs. 397-0-9." The diminished net profit at Dacca was due, it is said, to one of the worksheds for the manufacture of mustard oil having been unused for the greater part of the year. The tiled roof slipped during a storm, and as the building was not on the books of the Public Works Depart- ment, it could not be repaired. It will, however, shortly be made over to that department. 40. General management, alterations, and improvements.16 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. the scheme has been abandoned."

MEDICAL. CALCUTTA, THE 13TH JULY 1886. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) some extent in Dacca, Patna, Cuttack, and Berhampore. Pneumonia occurred in Dullunda only, and cholera in Berhampore. The decrease in these diseases, as also in phthisis, is a very satisfactory feature in the returns of the year under review. There were comparatively few cases of injuries to lunatics. In Dacca there were 3 cases of simple fracture and 5 cases of contused wounds, while at Dullunda 6 cases of injury were recorded, none of which proved fatal. The Lieutenant-Governor concurs in Dr. Cowie's view that " the absence of injuries of any kind in so many of the asylums is a most gratifying feature, and speaks highly for the great care and humanity exercised over the poor afflicted inmates." 6. The total number of deaths fell from 87 in 1884 to 73 in 1885. There was a decrease in Dacca and Patna. The mortality increased in the Dullunda Asylum from 18 in 1884 to 27 in 1885. It is explained that in this asylum a considerable proportion of the deaths consisted of old chronic hopeless cases that had been hanging on between life and death for a lengthened period. The Inspector-General remarks that post mortem examina- tions were seldom neglected. Complaints of overcrowding are made regarding the Dacca and Cuttack Asylums, but arrangements are being made which will relieve the former. At Cuttack, where there is a small local asylum, the urgency is not great. There was abundance of room at Patna and Berhampore. 7. The following table shows the receipts and expenditure in each asylum during 1885 :( 3 ) 14 East Indians, and 2 Armenians. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 19,731 against Rs. 19,804 in 1884. The total amount contributed by the friends of paying patients was Rs. 12,338. 10. It appears from the report that the different asylums were efficiently managed during the year under review.

The recoveries reckoned on average strength were less by 1.85 than the average of the previous ten years, and by .87 than the number of 1885.

At Patna no overcrowding is entered in the return. Here the verandahs are used as sleeping places, and are frequently made wet from driving rain in the south-west monsoon. They are consequently damp. If verandahs are to be taken into the account when calculating capacity, then there was no overcrowding at Patna. I would suggest that the brick platforms throughout this asylum be either Portland cemented or covered with hard asphalt. Parts of the asylum enclosure are subject to inundation which is said to result from the imperfect system of outside drainage. Dr. Nicholson, the Superintendent, informed me that, the subject of rectifying this evil was being considered by the proper authorities. The buildings in the Patna Asylum are old, and le tout ensemble of their arrangement and adaptation, can hardly be viewed as a suitable place, according to our modern ideas, in which to treat the insane.

In former reports I have shown that this table has no statistical value. It simply sets forth the prevalence of mental diseases among the several classes from which our insanes come. The admissions are classified according to religion. The totals of the respective communities are not given. All data needful to render the table of any special value are obviously wanting. For instance, the populations are not defined, the classes are not equally addicted to the use of intoxicants, and the proportion of persons admitted into the asylums to the total number of lunatics in the country is no where ascertainable. 11. The occupations, ages, and residence of those admitted are detailed in the usual tables. They require no special remark. TABLE No. 7.

Forms of insanity.8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. they were 11 and 36 in 1885. There was one death from dementia acute in 1886, while there was none in 1885. On the other hand melancholia shows a decrease of 2, dementia chronic 3, and not insane 2. No deaths took place under the divisions idiotcy and imbecility. Mania is the most fatal of all forms of insanity, next to it comes dementia chronic, a condition into which mania often passes. The present return fully illustrates this. It has been remarked before that the largest number of admissions for maniacal cases falls on the Presidency Asylum. They gave four-fifths of the total admissions in 1886. At Dacca maniacal admissions fell from 36 in 1885 to 31 in 1886, forming about two-thirds of the total. At Cuttack, as has been observed before, the admissions were ascribed almost entirely to mania, and chiefly to the acute form of the disease. In like manner Berhampore, as usual, holds its own in the same respect. It is in these two asylums chiefly, which so constantly exhibit a sameness in the types of insanity that has led to the supposition that uniformity may be due to a desire to simplify the nomenclature. In Patna maniacal cases rose from 23 in 1885 to 26 in 1886, and formed four-fifths of the total admissions. 15. Percentage of recoveries on total treated.LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 9 17.

Dr. Meadows says that " four chronic cases unfortunately died during November and December, or our mortality would not have exceeded that in 1885." Dr. Stewart of Cuttack writes that of the 10 deaths, four were from chronic dysentery occurring in weak individuals; one fatal case was an epileptic who died in a fit; one died of extreme old age ; one from tubercular phthisis in a female who had been in the asylum twice before; one was admitted into the asylum with syphilitic cachexia and was epileptic ; he died from gummatous deposits in the lungs and intestines; one died from disease of the heart following on rheumatic fever, and one was admitted into the asylum with Locomotor ataxy and succumbed in the usual way. On the whole, considering the year, the increase of population under confinement, the advanced age and chronic condition of many of the lunatics, and the fact that the asylums are Lunatic Asylums, I think we may pronounce the health of the institutions during the year under report to have been fairly good. 25. I append the following table obtained from the Sanitary Commis- sioner's Office, exhibiting the death-rate recorded in the cities and towns in which our Lunatic Asylums are situated. TABLE No. 13.

At Cuttack, Surgeon-Major W. D. Stewart, was in charge of the asylum throughout the year, except from 4th May to 19th June, when Dr. Zorab acted. Brigade-Surgeon C. J. J. Jackson, was in charge of the Berhampore Asylum from 1st January to 26th February ; Assistant Surgeon Beni Madhub Bose from 27th February to 11th March; Surgeon-Major E. Saunders from 12th March to 29th August. Dr. Jackson was again in charge for the rest of the year. 39. All the Superintendents report favourably of the good work performed by the subordinate establishments placed under their respective charges. The insanes have been well cared for and most kindly treated. EUROPEAN INSANE ASYLUM, BHOWANIPORE. 40. Population.18 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. A fewer number of persons were made over to the care of friends, the figures being 6 in 1886 against 12 so disposed of in 1885. The ratio per cent. of cures and transfers to total treated was 34.04, and on the daily average number 51.61. The ratio per cent. of mortality to total treated was 4.25, and on the daily average 6.54. 44. There were two deaths recorded in the asylum during the year- one a female from remittent fever, and one a male from phthisis. The latter case was admitted in an emaciated condition with the disease well advanced. 45. At the close of the year there remained under treatment 29 patientsLUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. 19 50.

MEDICAL AND SANITATION. Darjeeling, the 21st September 1887. READ( 2 ) segregate, manage or control criminal lunatics in an ordinary asylum. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals agrees in this view, but he does not think that the want of an asylum for criminal lunatics is so much a question of importance as separate accommodation for dangerous lunatics, or those whom it is found troublesome and difficult to manage. The Lieutenant-Governor is of opinion that it would be advisable to have a separate asylum for criminal lunatics only, but the expense both directly and indirectly caused by transfers would be so large, that the proposition is one which cannot be entertained at present. 4. The usual difficulty was experienced in regard to the classification of the insanes. During the year, however, 97 persons were returned under the head of "Acute mania," 78 under "Chronic mania," 11 under " Melancholia," 1 under " Acute dementia," 15 under " Chronic dementia," 2 under " Imbecility," and 14 as not insane. 5. The health of the asylums was fairly good. Of the principal diseases treated during the year, dysentery was most prevalent and increased in all the asylums, particularly in Dacca and Patna. Next in order come phthisis, fever, pneumonia and cholera. The last-named disease was reported only from the Berhampore Asylum. The number of injuries sustained by the lunatics in confinement was comparatively few. There . were only two cases of injuries inflicted by one lunatic on another. As regards the causes of insanity, 256 cases are said to have been due to ganja, 5 to bhag and churras, 53 to spirits, 7 to opium, 26 to fever, 38 to heredity, 25 to epilepsy, and 6 to childbirth. The mortality in the asylums increased from 73 in 1885 to 85 in 1886. Of the total number of deaths, 30 were returned from Dullunda, 16 from Dacca, 18 from Patna, 10 from Cuttack, and 11 from Berhampore. The principal causes of death were dysentery, phthisis, exhaustion from mania, apoplexy and diarrh( 3 ) The total expenditure was Rs. 88,110 against Rs. 86,279 in 1885. The increase was due to extraordinary expenditure on repairs and alterations to the asylum buildings during the year. The cost of estab- lishment and superintendence was Rs. 20,061 and Rs. 18,400, respectively, or nearly the same as it was in the previous year. Dullunda is still by far the most costly of all the asylums. The total amount expended on diet was Rs. 22,060 against Rs. 20,613 in 1885, showing an increase of Rs. 1,447, which was distributed among the Dullunda, Dacca, Cuttack, and Berhampore Asylums, and was mainly due to the rise in the price of provisions. The value of articles of diet made over from the Manufacture Department during the year was less than that of the previous year. The average cost of a lunatic's daily diet was one anna and five pies, against one anna and six pies in 1885. The cost of clothing and bedding, including articles received from the Manufacture Department, was Rs. 2,780, against Rs. 3,103 in 1885. The expenditure on account of manufactures was Rs. 22,791 against Rs. 29,248 in the previous year. 8. The foregoing paragraphs do not refer to the European Asylum at Bhowanipore the figures for which are given separately. There were in this asylum on the 1st January 1886, 29 lunatics, of whom 13 were males and 16 females. During the year 17 persons were admitted and 1 readmitted; of these 16 were from the civil population and two soldiers; four persons were discharged cured, one was made over to the Military authorities, four were despatched to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, six were transferred to the care of friends, one was sent to Europe as still insane, and two died, leaving 29 patients under treatment in the asylum at the close of the year. " Heredity " and " in- temperance " were found to be the chief causes of insanity. The total expendi- ture incurred in the asylum during the year was Rs. 20,271 against Rs. 19,731, the expenditure of the previous year. The receipts from paying patients fell from Rs. 9,233 in 1885 to Rs. 6,722 in 1886. 9. The management of the asylums appears to have been conducted with efficiency, and the subordinate establishments are favourably reported on. The insanes were well cared for and kindly treated.

LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. No. 3841. FROM A. HILSON, ESQ., M.D., Offg. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Calcutta, the 15th May 1888. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the report on the Lunatic Asylums of Bengal for 1887. 2. These comprise the institutions at Dullunda, Dacca, Patna, Cuttack and Berhampore, in which native insanes are confined, and also that of Bhowanipore, which, being set apart exclusively for Europeans and Eurasians, differs materially from the others in its constitution and economic arrangements, and will there fore be dealt with separately. 3.

At some of the asylums the bad effects of any over-crowding are to some extent obviated by allowing harmless lunatics to sleep in the verandahs of the buildings; but this practice is manifestly objectionable.

6 LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. This subject is at present engaging the attention of Government, and if the scheme, which has recently been introduced, of employing certain criminal lunatics as warders in jails with a view to their ultimate release meets with success, a further reduction in their numbers may be expected. 11.

Dated Darjeeling, the 5th July 1888. READ( 2 ) Berhampore bowel-complaints and fever were more than usually common. The diseases most prevalent in the asylums were anæmia and debility, diarrh( 3 ) The corresponding figures in 1886 were Rs. 20,061 and Rs. 18,401. The cost of clothing and bedding was Rs. 908 against Rs. 832, and the expenditure on account of manufactures amounted to Rs. 24,703 against Rs. 22,791 in 1886. 10. The number of patients in the European Asylum at Bhowanipore, at the beginning of the year, was 29, of whom 15 were males and 14 females. During the year 21 persons were admitted and 3 re-admitted, making a total of 53 patients; of these 8 were discharged cured, 2 were made over to military authorities, 2 were despatched to Europe under the Merchant Shipping Act, 4 were transferred to the care of friends, 2 were deported to Europe as still insane, and 4 died, leaving 31 patients in the asylum at the close of the year. The daily average number was 29 against 31 in 1886. The causes of insanity were chiefly intemperance, heredity and epilepsy. The death-rate in the asylum was 13.79 against 6.45 in 1886, but it is impossible to draw any conclusions from figures relating to so small an average population. The total expenditure amounted to Rs. 20,709 against Rs. 20,271 in 1886, and the average yearly cost of each lunatic was Rs. 714 against Rs. 654 in the previous year. The receipts from paying patients amounted to Rs. 8,115 against Rs. 6,722 the year before. 11. The sanitary condition of the asylum has been much improved by filling up an offensive drain on the western side of the building, and substituting a shallow saucer-drain of pucca masonry. 12. The management of all the asylums appears to have been efficiently conducted, and the members of the subordinate staff are all well spoken of by their immediate superiors. ORDER.
