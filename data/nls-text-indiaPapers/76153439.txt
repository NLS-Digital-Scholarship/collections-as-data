[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. On the 1st April 1908, the mufassal portion of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, was handed over to Mr. D. Quinlan, as Superintendent, while the Bengal Veterinary College, the Research Laboratory, and the area under the Glanders and Farcy Act in Calcutta, Howrah, Alipore, and parts of the 24-Parganas remained in my charge. I also exercised general control over promotion and posting of Departmental Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants of the Province. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 2. The students.The following is an extract from the remarks made by the Examining Board:( 3 ) continued high price of grain and fodder has been much to our disadvantage. One thousand seven hundred and forty-five operations were performed against 1,427 of last year and 403 horses were shod against 402 reported in the preceding annual report. The outstanding accounts for this year amounted to Rs. 583-2-0 which are expected to be realised shortly. 12. The Public Works Department and the College buildings.( 4 ) 4. I have applied the Act somewhat more strictly this year. Six prose- cutions were instituted and in five cases the owners were convicted and fined. There has been no trouble with the people. 5. Rupees 1,000 were sanctioned for the payment of compensation in certain cases and as an experiment to poor people whose horses are destroyed under the Glanders and Farcy Act and for the payment of a small fee to persons who give information of outbreaks of disease. In 28 cases compensation was given to the amount of Rs. 495-4-0 and fees amounting to Rs. 62 were paid in 40 cases for information. The contribution which was obtained from Government on the recommendation of Mr. Grourlay has been the means of saving much hardship to poor people. (3. Whilst the Remount Depôt was closed from April to October, 1,250 horses and 35 cattle were inspected by the Glanders staff on boardship at the Port of Calcutta; no clinical symptoms were observed. 7. Seven hundred and seventy-nine head of cattle were inoculated against Rinderpest in Calcutta and Suburbs by the Glanders staff. The outbreaks were of a mild description. The details of inoculations have been included in Table III of the departmental report. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY, 1908-09. PREFACE. THE Inspector-General in his No. 780-433 of 8th June 1908, requested that in future a separate report should be rendered yearly upon the work done in laboratories. As this is the first report of the kind emanating from this Institution it may be well to record something of the history of the place. 2. In September 1903, Colonel Morgan, who was at the time Inspector- General, recommended that a pit should be dug in the floor of one of the lecture rooms for the purpose of keeping biological products cool in the hot weather. This proposal was not found feasible, hence it was suggested that a cellar might be constructed in the grounds of the Annexe and covered with a super- structure which might easily be used as a laboratory. From this modest beginning the Institution sprang. It was soon found that the work rendered extension of the premises necessary. Government was able to sanction my proposals and to allow me to procure the necessary apparatus. 3. The laboratory now comprises a central building, a post-mortem, and an operating room. The central building consists of a work room for the Pathologist, a chemical and bacteriological laboratory, a micro photographic and drawing room, a dark room, and an incubator room, besides a cellar for stocking serum and other biological products. The staff consists of myself, Mr. S. N. Mitter, a graduate of the Bengal Veterinary College, who is my Lecturer on Pathology, but who does the work of Senior Assistant in the laboratory, Babu Sachindra Kishore Das Roy, Junior Assistant, also of an artist and two bearers who have been trained to prepare media, etc. 4. In 1906 the Government of Bengal gazetted this laboratory as the place for the investigation and diagnosis of animal diseases in the Province by Notification No. 1896Agri., of the 9th April 1906, and in the following year we undertook, at the request of the Chairman of the Calcutta Corporation, the diagnosis of rabies, which is so very prevalent in Calcutta. In the same year the Government in their No. 2122T.( 5 ) Epizootic Lymphangitis.( 6 ) SECTION III.( 7 ) TABLE I.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I held charge of the Civil Veterinary Department throughout the year and spent 269 days on tour, and travelled 2,034 miles by road and 18,016 miles by rail. 2. All dispensaries were inspected except Hazaribagh, and the work of most of the Itinerating Veterinary Assistants ; outbreaks of disease affecting horses and cattle were attended and I visited various shows and fairs in Bihar and Bengal as well as the cattle farms at Pusa, Siripur, and Kalimpong. 3. The first step in the reorganisation of the Department as sanctioned by the Secretary of State, was the appointment of Inspectors, to replace the Staff Veterinary Assistants whose main duty was to attend outbreaks of disease. The want of a sufficiently large inspecting staff is seriously felt but cannot be remedied for some years, at least, as most of the Assistants from which grade these men are drawn, are too inexperienced to take charge of such important posts. PART I.( 2 ) suspected cases were discovered and an Inspector was deputed to act in conjunction with the local Veterinary Assistant; 27 animals were tested with mallein, and eleven were found diseased. I inspected them before destruction. The local Assistant, Babu K. B. Dey, during this outbreak worked well. The next outbreak occurred at Tewara Factory in Muzaffarpur District. Fifteen ponies belonging to the owner of the Factory and to some local men of the cultivator class were put to the mallein test, and of these three proved to be infected and were destroyed. The cases reported from Patna were not brought to the notice of this Department, but were reported from the Police thanas at the end of the year. An enquiry is in progress, the result of which will be communicated to Government. 10. Anthrax.( 3 ) 19. During the year considerable improvement was noticed in the reporting of outbreaks and especially in their accuracy, but much still remains to be done in this direction ; only two reports were received from members of the Agricultural Associations, one from Rafi Uddin Mahomed of Cuttuck and the other from the Secretary, Agricultural Association, Bankipore. Post cards are now sent from the Police Stations to the Veterinary Assistants direct and not as formerly to this office, considerable delay being thus saved. Veterinary Assistants have also been directed to communicate to neighbouring districts, the existence of disease and in this way to prevent its spread. 20. It is hoped during the next year that the members of the various District Agricultural Associations will co-operate more readily than has been the case in the past by reporting the existence of contagious disease. They can be of immense benefit to the community by giving timely information of outbreaks to this Department or to the District Magistrate, and by helping to allay the prejudices of the raiyats against inoculation, when Veterinary Officers undertake that work in their neighbourhood. The Darjeeling Planters' Association and Bihar Planters' Association have been approached with the same object. 21. New rules have been issued to the Itinerating Veterinary Assistants under which they must visit thanas, important villages and members of the Agricultural Associations. 22. Pamphlets on cattle diseases and rules to prevent the spread of con- tagious diseases have been printed for circulation among cultivators. Copies of Hallen's Manual in English and vernacular have also been distributed. PREVENTIVE INOCULATION. 23. During the year under report 72 outbreaks of rinderpest in which preventive inoculation was undertaken were reported; 11,659 animals were inoculated against 5,978 in 58 outbreaks of the previous year; the mortality among protected cattle was 115 only, of which 29 deaths occurred among the animals in the Government Estate, Kalimpong, and 20 among the dairy cattle, Suri. In these outbreaks the high death-rate was evidently due to the greater susceptibility of hill cattle and plains cattle when they are kept under better conditions than village animals; thus, they are not sufficiently exposed to infection after the serum inoculation, and consequently obtain only the short protection afforded by the serum alone. 24. Regarding inoculation in the districts, it has not infrequently happened that this work was greatly curtailed, owing to the objections of the ryots in parts of Burdwan, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Palamau, Hooghly, and Sambalpur districts. The local authorities were informed in these instances. HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 25. Tables V and VI show the working of hospitals and dispensaries. During the year under report two new dispensaries have been opened( 4 ) many of which were under constant treatment. The Veterinary Hospital Committee, which was abolished in September 1903, was reconstituted during the month of September 1908 and since then three meetings have been held. 29. Palamau.( 5 ) 39.
