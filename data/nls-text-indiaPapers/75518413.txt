General administrative instructions. benefits which he has received under these rules in respect of that study leave and to the refund of any additional monies received under them. (4) The minimum period of study which will render an officer eligible for study leave shall be two months. (5) The minimum period of leave granted solely as study leave shall be six months. Time spent on the journey to and from India by an officer whose study leave is not combined with any other kind of leave will reckon as study leave, but the allowance specified in Rule 10 will not be granted during the period of the journey. An officer whose study leave is combined with any other kind of leave will, however, be required to take his period of study leave at such a time as to retain, at its conclusion, a balance of other previously sanctioned leave sufficient to cover his return journey to India. When an officer has been granted a definite period of study leave and finds after arrival in England that his course of study will fall short of the sanc- tioned period to any considerable extent, his absence from India will be reduced by the excess period of study leave unless ho produces the assent of the authorities in India to his taking it as ordinary leave. (6) Study leave can be combined with any other kind of leave, provided the period occupied in study is not less than two months and, in the case of leave granted on medical certificate, provided that the Medical Board at the India Office certifies that the officer is fit for study. The total period of leave granted in the first instance (study leave combined with any other leave) will not exceed one year. (7) Except as provided in Rule 8, all applications for study leave shall be submitted for approval, with the Audit Officer's certificate, to the D. V. S. through the prescribed channel ; and the course or course of study contemp- lated, with details as to institutions at which study will be undertaken, details of commencement and termination of each course, and any examination the candidate proposes to undergo, shall be clearly specified therein. A copy of the approved programme of study will be forwarded by the D. V. S. to the Under Secretary of State, Military Department, India Office. If it is not possible for an officer to give full details, as above, in his original application, or if, after arrival in England, he wishes to make any changes in the programme which has been approved by the D. V. S., he should immediate- ly on arrival in England apply to the Under Secretary of State, Military De- partment, India Office, for a form on which to submit the required particulars. In such cases the officer should not, unless prepared to do so at his own risk commence his course, nor incur any expenses in connection therewith, until he receives approval to the course through the Under Secretary of State, Military Department. (8) Officers on leave who wish to have part of their leave converted into study leave or to undertake a course of study during leave, should, before commencing study and before incurring any expenses in connection there- with, submit a programme of their proposed course of study to the Under Secretary of State, Military Department, India Office, on a form which can 6
General administrative instructions. Section 2. be obtained on application to that Department. The programme should be accompanied by an official syllabus of the course, if one is available, and by any documentary evidence that the particular course or examination has the approval of the authorities in India. In the absence of such evidence the programme may, if approved, be proceeded with, but no study allowance will be admissible until the concurrence of the authority concerned in India has been received. Similarly, officers on leave who desire to have it extended for purposes of study should address the Under Secretary of State, but in addition to fur- nishing a statement of the proposed study, they must support their applica- tions with documentary evidence of their having obtained the approval of the authorities concerned in India to their applying for an extension of leave. Such concurrence will not be necessary to the conversion of ordinary leave into study leave or for the issue of study leave allowance. (9) An officer who is at home on combined leave may be permitted to commence a course of study before the end of his privilege leave and to draw for such period the study allowance admissible under Rule 10 without forfeit- ing his privilege leave allowance. For all purposes of record and subsequent calculation of leave, the full amount of study leave taken shall in such cases be post-dated as if it had commenced at the end of the privilege leave. (10) For the course of study, a study allowance, at present fixed at 12s. a day in the United Kingdom, £1 a day on the Continent of Europe and £1 10s in the United States of America, will be admissible. These rates are liable to revision. No payment in respect of study allowances will be made until satisfactory certificates as required by Rule 12, are furnished on the completion of the course of study. It is to be understood that in order to qualify for the grant of study leave or for the receipt of study allowance, a definite course of post-graduate study must be taken at a recognised institution, or of study ordinarily associated with post-graduate work, which must be approved as suitable by the D. V. S. in India. This allowance will not be admissible to an officer who retires from the service without returning to duty in India after a period of study leave, and is liable to be refunded under Rule 3 above in the case of retireraent, otherwise than on account of ill-health, within 3 years of return to India. Periods not exceeding 14 days of vacation or interval between two courses of study may, at an officer's option, be treated as study leave, in which case the study allowance will be issued. Alternatively such periods may be taken as ordinary leave, in which case study allowance will not be issued. If such period exceeds 14 days, the excess will be treated as ordinary leave with- out study allowance. Study allowance may be given at the discretion of the Under Secretary of State, Military Department, India Office, for any period up to fourteen days at one time during which the officer is prevented by sickness duly certified by a medical practitioner from pursuing the sanctioned course of study. No course of study will be recognised as study leave for the purpose of the allowance or for any other purpose unless the course of study has been approved in accordance with paragraphs 7 and 8 above.

Section 2. General administrative instructions. (11) The rate of pay admissible during study leave is the rate of leave pay admissible under the Military rules. (12) On completion of a course of study, a certificate on the proper form (which may be obtained from the India Office), together with any certificate of special study, should be forwarded to the Under Secretary of State, Military Department, who will arrange for the transmission of the copies of the docu- ments to the D. V. S. in India. (13) Study leave will fount as service for promotion and pension, but not for leave. It will not affect any leave which may already be due to an officer, and will not be taken into account in reckoning the aggregate amount of leave admissible under Regulations. 14.
