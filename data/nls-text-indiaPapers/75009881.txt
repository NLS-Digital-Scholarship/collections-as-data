Women of the Army of BengalWOMEN AND CHILDREN OF EUROPEAN REGIMENTS, 1871. XIV. DETAIL of the CAUSES of the ADMISSIONS and DEATHS of the CHILDREN of EUROPEAN REGIMENTS. Children of the Army of Bengal2. NATIVE TROOPS, 1871. The regimental strengths upon which the actual death-rate for the year is calculated, are taken as at 1st January. The difference between the strength of January and December is 248 only, the strength on the 1st January having been 44,477, and on the 31st December 44,725. The death-rates may, therefore, be calculated with approximate accuracy on the strength with which regiments commenced the year. The total deaths, absent and present, amount to 792, and this number, with a strength of 44,477, represents a loss of 17.81 per 1,000. The deaths of men present with their regiments amounted to 592, giving a ratio of 15.04 in relation to a strength of 39,379, the average present during the year. 1871 12 A
