ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1894-95. PART I.2 English stal- lions. 6. During the year under review, 44 horses were imported from England. This number included 5 Half-breds, 14 Thorough breds, and 25 Hackneys. Of this number, one Thoroughbred and one Hackney died at sea, and one Tho- roughbred had to be destroyed at Bombay, owing to his having sustained a severe fracture of the pastern. The number therefore shown in Table I, as having been received by importation, stands at 41. 7. Speaking generally, the horses received from England have given satisfaction and are likely to prove useful sires. Naturally it is to be expected that a certain number of horses do not come up to the high standard which one is inclined to fix for horses that are employed as stallions; this applies more to the Thoroughbreds than to any other class; some are slightly deficient in bone, but this is the fault of the class generally, and General Sir J. Watson is to be congratulated on having been able to purchase such horses as &quot;Millom,&quot; &quot;Peregrine Falcon,&quot; &quot;Inoculation,&quot; and &quot;Wicklow Spar,&quot; amongst the Thoroughbreds; &quot;Holme Cadet,&quot; &quot;Generalissimo,&quot; &quot;Black Diamond,&quot; and others, amongst the Hackneys; whilst amongst the Half-breds, I would specially mention &quot;Fakeaway&quot; and &quot;Real Glue.&quot; The Department has been most unfortunate this year in the losses sustain- ed amongst the imported horses and especially so amongst the Thoroughbreds. The following horses of this class either died or were destroyed:3 arrangement had been made with the Arab Dealer Jasim-bin-Fid, to the effect that he was to import horses of a high class for the Department. He arrived so late in the year that I feel confident that a few horses of an exceptionally good stamp were lost to the Department through waiting for him. On his arrival, it was found that he had imported 25 horses, but on carefully inspect- ing his batch, only 6 were in any way suitable for sires, and even these were not the class calculated to get Remounts; granted, as he urged, that they were high caste horses, they were, with one exception, too small. I was, however, fortunate to obtain others combining quality, bone, and size, which are the combined requirements of a good sire, notably 3 Chestnuts4 Average num- ber of mares co- vered per stal- lion. 14. Table IV also shows the number of mares covered per stallion em- ployed:5 constantly appeal to me when on tour for more and with good reason, for, not only has the average of produce per stallion been much higher during the last two years, but an observer cannot fail to be struck with the large admixture, sometimes two or three successive crosses of Norfolk Trotter blood in the mares of some of the best districts: certainly there are many very fine mares of Norfolk Trotter blood, but they frequently show a tendency to heavy tops, heavy crests, insufficient hone and carrying power, and 1 feel convinced that the time has now come for the Thoroughbred English to neutralise this tendency. I think after the T. B. E. the Australian Thoroughbred may be depended on to give good results. It is very difficult to procure well bred Arabs of sufficient size to beget big horses, though, so far as I can judge from a limited experience, I am greatly in favour of the Arab being used for the small and purer country-bred mare of the frontier, till we have produced a larger breed and can then utilize our larger sires. &quot;Were they available I could place 10 or more T. B. E. or Australian Thoroughbred stallions to great advantage in the North Punjab, and since the Northern portion of the Derajat has been included in my Circle, I could place five more Arabs. &quot;From the experience gained by inspecting young stock at Fairs, remounts purchased at Fairs and Shows, produce brought for my inspection while on tour, &c., I have no hesitation in saying that I consider the Thoroughbred English the most suitable stock getter for the Army. I do not deny that the Norfolk Trotter blood is largely responsible for size and other advantages, but with the increased facilities for careful selection of mares for branding and the rejection of light weedy animals, I feel sure the Thoroughbred English is by far the best stallion for the districts under my charge.&quot; The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, re- marks:6 up the present stamp of mare; this read in connection with the remark made by the Superintendent, North Punjab, to the effect that he is greatly in favour of the Arab being used for the small and pure country bred mares of the Frontier till a large breed is produced, confirms the opinion which I have always held that we must, when dealing with the indigenous mare of the country, first cross her with Arabs, then when we obtain a cross sufficiently large, the Hackney can be brought in, but that too long a continuance of Hackney strains will lead to the production of a class of horse totally unfitted for mili- tary purposes; then it is that the Thoroughbred or big-boned Arab sire is called for. In Baluchistan, I am of opinion that but few, if any, Hackneys should be employed. In this part of the country we have a class of mare in every way calculated to throw good remounts when crossed with Thoroughbreds or big Arabs, and I consider that it would be bad policy to introduce any coarse blood. The demand for Thoroughbred English and Arab sires is much greater than the supply, but this year it is hoped that 14 Thoroughbreds will be received for Northern India by importation from England, and that 6 Aus- tralian Thoroughbreds will also be received. This number added to 13 Arabs that will be purchased during the year will go far to satisfy the demands made by the various horse breeding centres. Stallions which produce the most suitable stock for the Army. 17. Table V (page xiii). It was stated in last year's report that the statistics contained in the Table could not be supplied by the various Superin- tendents as they were unable to visit the Dep6ts on every occasion when re- mounts were issued, and even if they did, this would give no idea of the number of rejections. The information can only be supplied by the Remount Department and the Director of that Department has kindly furnished the statistics contained in this Table. It will be seen that 492 remounts were fit to be issued, and that of this number, 37 or 7.5 per cent. were either cast as unfit or sold as undersized. The percentage of remounts issued with known pedigrees must be consi- dered satisfactory. The percentage of those noted as unknown being only: 22 per cent. at Ahmednagar. 22.4 per cent. at Kurnal. At Hapur, the percentage of such is rather high, standing as it does, at 46 per cent. Country-bred remounts. Number pur- chased:7 The decrease is very noticeable in Bengal; the number bought in that Presidency being 1,674 against 1,972 last year. This decrease is due to two causes:8 The Native Cavalry bought 1,152 remounts at Fairs and Shows, where they could have availed themselves of the services of the Zilladars of this Department who are always at their disposal to afford them any information they may require. As this information is of the utmost value to this Department, to enable it to ascertain what class of stallion or what particular stallion is producing the best results, the Government of India have been addressed with a view of endeavouring to ensure a more correct record in future years. The Superinten- dents, Civil Veterinary Department, connected with horse breeding, paid much attention to the issue of Produce Certificates, and, to assist purchasing officers, the native name, which a horse hitherto had in addition to his English name, has been dropped, as it was said that two names attached to one horse was confusing. 20. A Statement is appended (vide Table VI (c), page xxii) showing the districts in which the various remounts were bought. One point strikes me at once, viz., that the two districts from which the largest numbers were bought were:PART I-IMPERIAL REPORT. A.PART I.12 The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, reports as follows:13 indents on that country as much as possible. This I trust we shall be able to do in a few years. By this I do not mean that we shall ever be able to do en- tirely without Italian donkeys as sires, but I trust that the day will arrive, and that it is not far distant, when we shall be able to produce an indigenous breed of Jacks that will take the place of imported ones for mule breeding, although a certain number of the latter will be required annually to infuse new blood in the country donkey mare, and also to assist in the supply of a big class of donkey for producing Ordnance mules. During the year under review, great attention has been paid to this point; and I have had large numbers of donkeys collected for my inspection in different parts of India. From these I have been able to select 10 excellent animals in every way calculated to produce good mules. I would draw special attention to the following statement:14 36. In order to foster this industry, a good Italian donkey has been supplied to Iskan Khan Tarin, Resident of Toreshah, Tehsil Pishin, Quetta district. He has provided 40 good donkey mares which he will increase to 50 next year. He has also promised to increase this number by selection from the best of those belonging to zemindars living near him. A stand has also been established in the Rawalpindi district, this being a centre possessing very fine donkey mares. 37. In addition to the advantages which this Department will derive from attention to the improvement of donkeys in this country, the Government of India will also be adding to its Transport supply; as if a good stamp of donkey, measuring 12-3 in height, with good bone, can be produced, he will make a better transport animal than a mule of similar height, as his carrying powers will be equal and he will prove more hardy on a campaign entailing hardship and short rations. 38. I regret to say that the Bombay market has utterly failed to produce Persian donkey sires. During the year under review, a number were expected, but I was only able to purchase one, and this one was so small that it was only fitted for District Board work. Whilst in Bombay, I endeavoured to make arrangements whereby a supply would be ensured, but I am not at all hopeful of success. The dealers wish to insist that this Department is to take every donkey imported, and as this would certainly tend to the importation of a large percentage of animals totally unfitted for mule breeding, I would not consent to their proposals. They have, however, been informed that the maximum price, viz , Rs. 350, will be paid for every donkey of dark colour that comes up to the standard requirements. It is, however, hoped that a market will be started at Quetta, at which Persian and Herati donkeys will be obtainable. 39. A reference to the statement above given will show that the Zanzibar and Somali donkeys possess neither height, girth, nor bone. The 5 Zanzibaris have been equally divided between North-Western Provinces, North and South Punjab, but the Somalis are totally unfitted for mule breeding. By orders received from the Government of India, these latter have been offered to all the District Boards in the North-Western Provinces and Punjab, but owing to their size, the biggest being 10-1½ hands in height, only one has been selected by these bodies. Number of Mules purchas- ed by Govern- ment. 40. Table X, page xxxix, will show the number of mules purchased, by which it will be seen that only 138 were bought by the Remount Department and Batteries; this is but a very small number; the cause I attribute to the fact that purchases by this Department were mainly made in April 1895 and will be shown in the current year. The number purchased by the Commissariat and Transport Departments was 1,669 against 1,798 last year,
PART I.PART I.18 The reduction has been made by attention to the stringent orders issued during the year with reference to excessive charges made under the heading of Contingencies, and in carrying out this reduction I must state that Veterinary Lieutenant Loughlin, the Superintendent, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, has most assiduously striven to give effect to all orders issued with a view of reducing expenditure. A saving has also been effected by selling all Farm produce at current market rates. Branded mares. Number present19 1893-94. 1894-95. Baluchistan ... ... ... ... 1,218 1,893 Central India ... ... ... ... 199 146 Deccan ... ... ... ... 574 628 Guzerat ... ... ... ... 139 150 Sindh and Cutch ... ... ... 610 498 The increase in the number of mares covered by Government stallions in the provinces comprised in Bengal, amounting as it does to 1,100, is most satisfactory. The increase in Baluchistan, amounting to 675, is also worthy of note. Bombay has made no progress, in fact Deccan and Guzerat in this Presidency show a decrease of 65, and it is to be regretted that Sindh, the best horse breeding portion of the Presidency, shows a decrease of 112 cover- ings. Sale of barren branded mares. 46. It having been brought to notice that difficulty was experienced by the owners in selling barren branded mares to purchasing officers, and that this fact rendered the brand unpopular, it was decided, with the sanction of the Government of India, to alter the rule which stood as follows :20 Next to North Punjab comes the Derajat. The percentage of mares that held to the number covered is actually better, reaching, as it does, 36 per cent., but the average per stallion is slightly lower. South Punjab comes next with an average of 13.74 per stallion em- ployed and a percentage of 29.61 of mares that held to the number covered. The working in Bombay is shown as referring to horses only; pony breed- ing not being taken into calculation. The working shown is decidedly bad. The results being an average of only 24.6 per cent. of mares held to the number covered, and the average per stallion employed in Sindh and Cutch being only 5.23 is the worst during the year under review. 49. We cannot possibly claim to be able to show good working until we reach 40 per cent. of successes to the number of mares covered, and I am pleased to find that the North Punjab are gradually working to this point. Forty per cent. is the general average, I believe, of successful coverings on the Continent, although it is frequently higher at home; but in this country where we have to contend against the ignorance of the breeder and want of supervision of the stallions, we can, I fear, never expect to reach the high percentages reached in England. 50. One important step has been taken this year, viz., that of providing each stand with bridles for the mares at the time of covering. Hitherto, the mares were frequently held with a piece of rope which broke whilst they were being covered, the result being that the operation was not successful. The supply of bridles to each stand will, I feel, supply a long felt want. Castration 51. The number of colts castrated (Table XIII, page xlvii) during the two past years has been as follows :PART IPART I.24 There is a slight decrease in the number of pony mares covered, but still as the general average of mares covered to stallions employed is 63.78, the work done by the donkeys is, in some cases, too severe. It is hoped that next year an appreciable increase in the number of donkey mares covered will be shown, but to do this, it will be necessary to supply the North-Western Provinces, Punjab and Baluchistan, with more donkey power. This I trust to be able to do when the increase of 20 donkeys sanc- tioned during the present year is obtained. Number of mule stock foaled. 55. The average of mule produce per stallion employed, as shown in Table IX, is still unsatisfactory ; it being as follows :PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. B.PART I.28 This complaint is so frequent that I shall be compelled to address the Government of India on the subject; without these returns it is simply impossi- ble to know the resources of the horse supply of different districts. Batesar Horse Fair. 62. This fair commenced on 10th and was advertised to continue until 19th November 1894, but it was practically over on 16th, all the purchasing officers having left before that date. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, recommended last year that it should only last a week, and many of the Remount Officers complain of the duration of this Fair. This matter will be brought to the notice of the Local Government. 63. This Fair is fast losing the position which it once held as one of the largest horse markets in India. The number present this year being 10,040 against 13,217 last year, showing a decrease of 3,047. 64. The number of remounts purchased was as follows:29 The judging took place on the 15th November, as Mr. Loughlin could not attend at an earlier date. Most of the remount purchasers found it impossible to keep their purchases so long at the Fair, and I should recommend that if Government can let us have the Veterinary Surgeon of Babugarh at an earlier date, the Judging Committee be held on the bathing day or even one day earlier. Nearly all the remounts were purchased, and many of them had left the fair, by the bathing day this year. As the object of the prizes at this fair is to encourage breeders and dealers to bring horses fit for the Government services, I consider the prize money in remount classes thrown away unless the judging takes place before the remounts are taken from the fair. On the other hand, remount purchasing officers would object strongly to the horses being judged before their purchases were practically completed, as the procedure would enhance the prices of those horses which obtained prizes. The prices paid for remounts were high, one officer buying five horses for an average price of Rs. 395 each. Circular No. 20-138 of the Government of India, dated 22nd October 1894, came to this District too late to be brought into operation this year. The dealers obtained practically all the prizes in every class. Batesar is essentially a dealer's Fair. Out of the seven prize winners of the two-year old geldings, five had known pedigrees. Out of the seven prize winners amongst the yearling geldings, six were of known pedigrees. The pedi- gree of the remounts was chiefly unknown. The classes shown were poor, with the exception of the remounts, which were of good quality, but dear.&quot; 68. Owing to the fact that Horse Fairs and Shows are carried on for many days in the North-Western Provinces30 best in North-Western Provinces, is that all these remounts were purchased from dealers and none from breeders. 73. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, in his report states:31 (2) &quot; That prizes be awarded from Imperial funds for mules and horses. This could be done by reducing or discontinuing the amounts allowed for prizes at Batesar and Etawah, which are dealers fairs. (3) &quot; That the Superintendent, Remount Department, be allowed to purchase mules at this fair for the Babugarh Depôt. This year there were certainly very few up to the age and size required, but I am of opinion that if the zemindars knew they would get good prices by keeping their mules another year, they would do so, instead of selling them to the Punjab dealers at a smaller price. No. 1 has been referred to the local authorities. No. 2 will be borne in mind when allotting the grant for prizes, and will be given effect to as far as possible. No. 3 has been referred to the Director, Army Remount Department, who, I feel certain, will be only too glad to obtain mules at this show, owing to its proximity to the Hapur Rearing Depôt. Meerut (Nau- chandi) Horse Show. 83. The Nauchandi Horse Show was held at Meerut from 18th to 24th March 1895, and was one of the most successful ever held in that district. 84. The number of horse stock that attended was 1,753 against 1,689 last year and 1,405 the previous year, showing an increase of 64 on last year and 348 on the previous year. The fact that the stock increases yearly at any particular show proves its popularity. A most healthy sign at this show was that the breeders stock amounted to 1,172. 85. The Remount Officer purchased 14 for British Cavalry and could have got 40 or 50 more, had he required them. Eighty-three remounts were purchased for Native Cavalry, Native States, and Police; but on this point no information is forthcoming as the Re- mount Officers who attended this show failed to send in the Remount Rolls. In connection with this, the Collector states :32 Service Troops, and 16 for Police. This must be considered most satisfactory, especially as the Remount Agent states:33 mares, 6 branded fillies, and 17 head of young stock competed for prizes; and even these were an indifferent lot. The actual number present appears to have been slightly in excess of last year. On this occasion, 5,065 are reported to have been present. 95. The number of remounts obtained from this great number of horses proves them to have been of poor quality. The Remount Agent obtained 20 head of young stock. This officer considers that the number exhibited for sale was less than former years, but that the quality was about the same. The 10th Bengal Lancers purchased 15 from dealers. Major Wood re- marks :34 prize winners among the young stock showed a large proportion of stud bred animals, though no enquiries were made on the point till prizes had been awarded. so stud bred and other animals were judged entirely on their merits. About 100 mares were branded, bringing the total of branded mares in the district up to over 600. The people, as a rule, consider the Arab stallions too small for their mares, but at the same time they dislike Norfolk Trotters, it showing much coarse blood. Some of the best brood mares are I believe taken to Shahpur to be covered by Thoroughbreds, as there is only one Thoroughbred horse in this district; another Thoroughbred would be much appreciated. In the two large classes, branded mares and Waziri animals, one man was allowed to take as much as two prizes. In other classes not more than 1 prize was allowed, a certificate being given instead of a prize where one owner was adjugded more than one prize.&quot; 100. I have instructed the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to do his utmost to meet the Deputy Commissioner's wishes with reference to the supply of another Thoroughbred, but horses of this class are in such demand that I am not certain that we shall be able to comply with his request this year. 101. With reference to the concluding portion of this officer's remarks, the rule referred to by him was framed to prevent large private studs, the property of Native gentlemen, absorbing all the best prizes to the detriment of the smaller breeders ; the Judging Committee has the right to decide whether any breeder comes under this rule or not, and I am pleased to find that on this occasion they exercised their discretion in the matter by allowing breeders to take two larger prizes in the larger classes. Beri Donkey- Fair. 102. Being most desirous to obtain indigenous donkeys for mule breeding, I directed Veterinary Lieutenant Drage to attend this fair on 5th and 6th Octo- ber 1894. In his report he states:35 Dera Ghazi Khan Horse Show. 106. This show was held on 7th and 8th March 1895, and was an unqualified. success, not only in the numbers that attended, but also in the numbers that competed for prizes. The former showed an increase of 618 compared with last year, and a very large increase as compared with all previous years. The numbers, however, that competed for prizes were even greater as will be seen from the following statement: 36 I quite agree with this, and have endeavoured, as far as possible, to intro- duce this system into other shows. The awarding of small prizes just pays a zemindar's expenses whilst he attends a show. 110. During the show, 82 mares were branded. 111. The Deputy Commissioner, in his report, brings forward the advisa- bility of awarding some prizes to Powindahs, and says :37 121. Forty-four remounts were purchasad, of which 13 were obtained by the Inspecting Officer, Imperial Service Troops; this batch was a particularly good level one. Referring to remounts, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, states:38 128. Ferozepore is one of the best breeding districts of the South Punjab, and it is doubtful if Jellalabad, situated in the Mamdot territory, is the best place at which a District Show could be held; it is very difficult to reach and there- fore purchasers are deterred from attending, still, as from the date on which shows were first held in this district, Jellalabad has always been the place selected, it would perhaps be unwise to change it, especially as the Managers of the Estate have promised to make a good road direct from Ferozepore. 129. This show, although smaller, produced more remounts than last year. The following were purchased :39 The Deputy Commissioner reports as follows :40 The Deputy Commissioner states that this is an improvement on past years, and with reference to the prizes offerred for the remount class, adds:41 152. An error has occurred in Major Gordon's report. He shows the average cost of the remounts purchased by Major Dawson, 9th Bengal Lancers, to have been Rs. 390; this should be Rs. 285, as shown in the Remount Roll sub- mitted by Major Dawson. Multan Horse Show. 153. This show was held on 11th and 12th March 1895. The disappoint- ment expressed by me last year is increased on this occasion. Again there was a great falling off in the numbers, both of those that actually attended and of those that competed for prizes. The numbers stand as follows:42 Rawalpindi Horse Fair. 157. This fair was held from 1st to 3rd April 1895, and although there was a slight falling off in the total number of animals present43 A Veterinary Dispensary, fully equipped with medicines and instruments, was opened on the fair ground and placed in charge of two Veterinary Assis- tants. There were 60 admissions to the dispensary, mostly for simple disorders. A separate enclosure, some distance from the fair ground, was set apart for infectious or contagious cases, but there were no admissions. 166. I would record my best thanks to the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Bec- kett, for the great interest which he showed in everything likely to add to the success of the fair as well as to the Judging Committee, which was composed as follows :44 171. With this opinion I fully agree. Having attended the show I satisfied myself that but few of the exhibits belonged to the district, and those that did were decidedly poor. Mule breeding is likely to prosper much more than horse breeding ; still, I would regret to drop any endeavour which has been made to improve the horse stock of the district. It was therefore decided with the Deputy Commissioner, Major Egerton, who takes a lively interest in the mat- ter, to remove one Thoroughbred English and two Hackneys, and to supply two small high caste Arabs which will be more suitable for the mares, also to in- crease the donkey power. This latter I look upon as essential, as there are many mares in this district suitable for mule breeding. The abolition of this show will, I feel, not be detrimental to the interests of the district, as the distance from Gujrat is small. 172. Two remounts were purchased by the Remount Agent. The Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department, in conclusion, states:45 number sold, viz., 5 for Native Cavalry, 3 for Police. The highest price being Rs. 350, the lowest Rs. 129.&quot; The average price paid by the Deoli and Erinpura Irregular Force, for the 5 remounts purchased, was Rs. 249. He further adds:46 Captain Westlake, the Remount Agent, is of opinion that the quality of the horses at Sonepore Fair is deteriorating. The officer purchasing for 4th Bengal Cavalry is of opinion that this fair should be abolished for Bengal Cavalry remounts, as the market is entire- ly spoilt by natives coming from Calcutta. 186. I regret to have to report that a case of glanders was detected at this fair, but owing to the fact that Act XX of 1879, Glanders and Farcy Act, is not extended to Bengal, no action could be taken in the matter. I shall again allude to this when remarking on the prevalence of glanders in India. BENGAL. Kalimpong Mule Fair. 187. This fair, held from 27th to 30th November 1894, was started with a view of encouraging a market for mules that are brought into the Darjeeling district with merchandise. That this fair is becoming popular as it becomes known is proved by the fact that whilst in 1892 only 10 mules were brought and last year 158, on this occasion over 250 were offered for sale. 188. The Mountain Battery stationed at Jalapahar purchased 9 very fair mules at an average of Rs. 260, and the Transport Department 162 at an aver- age of Rs. 133. More animals would have been bought, but they did not reach the minimum height of 12-2. 189. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, Veteri- nary Captain Gunn, remarks :47 193. In last year's report the Political Agent and Deputy Commissioner, Quetta, took a very gloomy view of the prospects of the show, owing to the fact that before the fair commenced and before many of the buyers had arrived, the best horses had been sold; owing to this, he predicted that the future of the fair would be doomed. This officer again takes the same view, complaining greatly of the want of buyers, and adds :48 &quot; With this object in view, I am instructing the Political Agent and Deputy Commissioner, Quetta-Pishin, to advertise the fair very much more largely, and to draw up a printed circular for transmission to Officers Commanding British and Native Cavalry regiments all over Northern and Central India, pointing out the advantages of the Quetta show as a remount fair, describing the class of horses obtainable, and explaining the best means of competing with and forestalling the native dealers. Colonel Gaisford will also be instructed to spend, if necessary, less money on prizes and to utilise a portion of the grant to meet charges for advertising the advantages of the fair in the public papers.&quot; 199. I have hitherto confined my remarks to the Northern Horse Trade. The present horse show was noticeable for the grand collection of mares and the promising young stock, and I look on Baluchistan as one of our best fields for horse breeding. It possesses everything in its favor, especially in the way of soil and climate. I cannot do better than quote Colonel Gaisford's remarks on this point:49 to be judged, and certainly they were a particularly fine lot of horses. The average price of remounts bought by Native Cavalry regiments, from whom rolls were received, was under Rs. 200. 205. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, states in his report:50 Naushehro (Moro) Horse Show. 217. This show was held on 4th February 1895, and must be considered to have been very successful. The brood mares were good and 74 remounts were purchsed by Native Cavalry and Police. Bhuj Horse Show. 218. This show was held on 28th February 1895. Only 196 horses were exhibited. The yearling colts and fillies are reported as being good, but the remaining classes were very moderate. Six head of young stock were purchased for the Rearing Depôt. MADRAS. Tiruppur Pony Show. 219. During the year 1894-95, two pony shows were held in the Madras Presidency. The first was held at Tiruppur in the district of Coimbatore, on 22nd May 1894, and although the exhibits were somewhat less than at the show held last year, the quality of the animals was better, and the judges remarked on the evident care bestowed by the owners on the animals that were shown. The falling off in numbers is attributed to the fact that exhibitors are gradually getting to know what constitutes a show animal and not to a falling off in interest in the show, as many ponies were brought in for sale that were not exhibited. Class I for mares in foal by Government stallions was represented by 29 exhibits, which are reported by the Judging Committee as being well grown mares showing superior quality. Mecheri Pony Show. 220. The Mecheri pony show in the Salem district was held on 11th March 1895. The Judging Committee report a distinct improvement on the show held last year at Hosur in this district, and are of opinion that time is only required to ensure the success of pony breeding. The Collector of Salem reports as follows :51 The increase is mainly due to the Punjab, which shows 1,224 more ex- hibits than last year. The quality of the exhibits this year was undoubtedly good, and year by year an improvement is noticed in this direction. The breeders are beginning to know what class of animal is likely to take a prize, and horses of very inferior quality are no longer brought into the ring. 223. One of the most satisfactory features was the large increase in the number of animals, the property of breeders, showing that the industry is gaining popularity year by year. The numbers are as follows:52 227. The total number of mules purchased by Government rose from 178 to 885, and 2,123 were purchased by others against 1,167 last year. This gives a total of 3,008 mules purchased at horse fairs and shows against 1,348 last year; this increase is most satisfactory. Of 885 purchased by Government and of 2,123 purchased by others, 658 and 1,683 respectively were obtained in the Punjab. For some years to come the Punjab will be the largest and best field from which mules will be obtainable, still it is satisfactory to note that 471 were bought in the North-Western Provinces, whilst none were obtainable last year. Sindh, when properly developed, should also prove a good mule breeding tract. Twenty-five were purchased this year at the Jacobabad show, whilst only four were obtained last year at Shikarpur. Horse Shows in Madras Pre- sidency. 228 As various changes have been made during the year under review, it is hoped that they will lead to a gradual improvement in the shows held in the Madras Presidency. The first and most important change is that the attendance of the Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department, will only be required three times annually for a month on each occasion, for the purpose of lecturing at the Saidapet Agricultural College, and when there, will also be required to visit and inspect the Veterinary Hospital three times a week, instead of having to extend his lectures over a period of about nine months as was formerly the case. This will leave him much more time to attend to this important subject. 229. Again, the pony breeding in the Madras Presidency has been brought under the direct supervision of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, and it is confidently expected that this important change will be followed by good results. He will, by being well acquainted with the mares of the Coimbatore and Salem districts, be in a position to select suitable stal- lions, and failing this, the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, has informed the Board of Revenue that he will gladly assist them to purchase the stallions required when he is buying in the Bombay market; but before doing this he will endeavour to arrange with the Government of Madras to collect a certain number of mares at suitable centres in each district, in order that he may be in a better position to judge of the class of stallion likely to suit the mares available for breeding. 230. During the year under review, 8 stallions would appear to have been employed in Coimbatore district; these 8 ponies covered 281 mares. In Salem, 4 stallions covered 174 mares. 231. Of 206 mares covered in 1893-94 in Coimbatore, results were ascer- tained in 158 cases and only 27 per cent. were successful. Of 209 covered in Salem, results were traced in 151 cases and only 16 per cent. were suc- cessful. 232. I do not agree with the Superintendent, who attributes this want of success to the fact that too many mares are covered by each stallion, neither can I believe that District Officers bring mares to the stallions out of season, as is stated by him in his report, in order to bring up the total number of coverings. 233. The non-submission of the Statistical Forms adopted by other Pro- vinces is to be regretted, as it renders the report submitted by the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, very difficult to follow. Stallions whose produce won prizes. 234. The abstract of Table XVI (page lvi) shows the number of prizes awarded to stock, the produce of different classes of sires, by which it will be seen that the Thoroughbred English very closely approximate in number of prizes taken to those taken by the half-breds, Norfolk Trotters, and Hackneys. The percentages being, respectively, 5.08 and 5.90. This shows the English Thoroughbred to be a successful foal-getter, as only 72 stallions of this class were employed against 156 Hackneys. Horse Runs, 235. The sum of Rs. 350 was alloted, as usual, for horse runs. Of this amount, Rs. 250 was given in prizes in the Rawalpindi district, and Rs. 50 in Multan. No progress has been made in this direction, and I fear that as culti- vation increases, horse runs will diminish in size and number.
PART I.PART I56 242. To commence with, the amount of arable land in the North-Western Provinces Depôt was reduced by 11 acres, in addition to the reduction effected in the dub grass area, and the cultivated portions of this farm were brought together instead of being divided as they had hitherto been; this latter plan resulted in the irrigation being performed by two instead of by four wells. 243. At the end of the year the farm was inspected again, but the results still proved that the strain on the farm mares was too great to warrant a system being advocated which could not be brought to a successful issue when tried under the most advantageous circumstances. It has therefore been decided by the Government of India to discontinue the instruction and demonstration classes at Babugarh. The farm will be in future used entirely for the pur- pose of raising fodder for the stallions at the depôt; but experiments will be continued in the way of raising new fodder crops, and with this view I am in communication with Dr. Leather, Agricultural Chemist to the Government of India, in order to increase the experiments. Balance sheet of cultivation operations. 244. Tables XVII & XVII (a) (pages lxvi and lxviii) are balance sheets showing the expenditure incurred. The former is that of North-Western Prov- inces Depôt, which shows a profit of Rs. 3,579-9-5; the latter is that of the Punjab Depôt which shows a profit of Rs. 1,091-14-11. In both cases is there an increase over last year. In the case of North-Western Provinces Depôt, the profit exceeds that of last year by Rs. 1,258-10-4, and that of the Punjab Depôt by Rs. 561-13-6; this must be considered satisfactory, as in addition to the savings effected, a further saving will be shown in the average cost of feed and keep of the stallions whilst at the depôt; this has been effected by reducing the prices at which fodder, &c., grown on the farm was sold. During the year under review, the current market rates have been strictly adhered to; this has resulted in the value of produce raised at the farm and sold to Government stallions being reduced greatly, but this has been more than counterbalanced by the cost in cultivation in North-Western Provinces Depôt, which this year has been shown at Rs. 3,257-2-2 against Rs. 6,948-14-4 last year. This has been effected by the reduction in the amount of labour employed; a great por- tion of the work that had hitherto been done by this agency being now carried out by the syces and grasscutters employed at the depôt. Return of Farm animals. 245. Table XVIII (page lxx) shows the number of farm animals pre- sent on 1st April 1894, and remaining on 31st March 1895. Casualties. 246. Table XIX (page lxxi) shows the number of casualties amongst the farm animals, by which it will be seen that one died and two were des- troyed. Sales. 247. Table XX (page lxxii) shows the number of farm animals sold. By the orders of Government, these farms keep up a reserve of 10 pony stallions to supply indents received from District Boards during the year. These were bought in Bombay during the cold weather, and the greatest care was observed in their selection, higher prices were paid but none but good animals were selected, and it is found that District Boards are only too glad to pay enhanced prices to obtain good sires. The increase in the initial cost is but trifling, and it is readily understood by these bodies that an inferior animal costs as much to maintain as a good one. 248. As in former years, I purpose giving the report of each Superin- tendent in extenso, as I consider both contain useful information with reference to fodder crops. 249. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states:57 Impey. &quot;The area under impey cultivation was 1¼ acres. This was also a good crop and yielded 869 maunds 15 seers, and 37 seers of seed. The seed was sown in March and three cuttings were obtained during the year. Impey is much relished by horses on account of the amount of sac- charine matter it contains, and is very useful for horses that are thin and in poor condition. Buffaloe grass. &quot; A quarter of an acre was under buffaloe grass cultivation, and gave an outturn of 66 maunds and two seers, and in addition to this 12 seers of seed. It is a good fodder crop and is useful for horses. The seeds were sown in June, the young plants thinned out to a foot apart in July, and the crop gathered in September. Sundhio Jowa- ree. &quot; Half an acre was devoted to this fodder as an experiment. The seed was obtained from Mr. Mollison, Superintendent of Farms, Bombay Presidency. It was sown in June and gave a heavy outturn. A few maunds were given to the horses green; they did not appear to care for it as much as impey. Unfortunately, owing to the high winds and heavy rain, the seed was all lost and the stalks were broken down and became useless for feeding purposes. Carrots. &quot; We had ¾ acres of carrots, half of it English and half country ; from this, 70 maunds and 13 seers of the former and o9 maunds 19 seers of the latter were obtained : both descriptions were of, very good quality. Dub grass. &quot; The area under dub cultivation was 14 acres, and the total outturn was 609 maunds 7 seers. We have had to reduce this crop very much, as during the hot weather it required continual watering and the work was too much for our farm mares. Hay. &quot; The hay made during the year was 2,300 maunds, all of it well saved and of excellent quality The Hapur encamping ground gave us a very fair outturn of good sweet hay, the amount obtained being 1,350 maunds. This year one-third of its area is being ploughed up and sown with a mix- ture of grass seeds, when it is expected a heavier crop will be obtained this year. Bedding grass. &quot; Three hundred maunds of excellent bedding grass was obtained from the Hapur encamping ground. Bedding grass is a very expensive item in the feed and keep of the stallions, we having to pay Re. 1 per 2½ maunds. We shall try this year and make some arrangement with the zemindars to take a certain number of acres and cut the grass ourselves. We tried this last year, but it was too late in the season and the contractors had bought it all up. Oats. &quot; We had 7¾ acres of oats. Off this we got 76 maunds 35 seers green, whilst 230 maunds of oats and 492 maunds of straw were stacked for future use. On account of the late rains, the oat crop was a great success. Indian-corn. &quot;The area under Indian corn cultivation was 2¾ acres. The yield being 17 maunds 15 seers. This must be considered a fair crop. Gram. &quot; Two varieties of gram were sown58 Produce. &quot; The foalings this year again have been very unsatisfactory. There being only one horse and 3 donkey colts during the year, whilst 1 horse, 2 pony, and 3 donkey mares aborted. &quot; The scarcity of foals and number of abortions I attribute to hard work in the pumps and plough, low condition, infection, and foul pasturage. The double endless chain pump with two tubes, each 3¼ inches in diameter, is very hard work for two mares, and this is kept going day and night during the hot weather. Constant hard work like that in this country reduces the vitality of animals and renders them incapable of breeding. &quot; It is now proposed to substitute one tube, 2 inches in diameter for one of the 3¼ inch tubes, and in this way, although the amount of water taken up will be reduced in quantity, the draught on the animals will be considerably lightened. &quot; There was a large area under cultivation during the year, and consequently there was a great deal of ploughing for the mares. Working horses singly in ploughs is hard work, especially when in charge of careless syces as ploughmen, the draught is uneven. I have watched them ploughing on several occasions, one time the plough share is skimming along the surface of the soil, and suddenly the ploughman gives the handles a lift and sends it down to the beam, causing a sudden strain on the mare, finding it going too deep, he leans on the handle and again it comes to the sur- face. This unequal strain is very trying for brood mares, and likely to cause them to abort Particularly if they are excitable, and the majority of country-breds are. &quot; Owing to the amount of land under cultivation, and the constant work at the pumps, and a limited supply of grazing, the mares were in very poor condition, and animals in very low condi- tion do not usually breed. &quot; The farm mares were confined in a paddock of about 4 acres, which I consider was much too small for so great a number of animals, and consequently it became foul ; the mares commenced aborting whilst I was on tour ; on my return, I had them all sent to Mara Singh's bagh, about a mile distant, with the result that no more abortions occurred. &quot; This year it is proposed to reduce the amount of cultivation, to make new paddocks for the mares, and to plough up and take a crop off the old ones. &quot; In previous years, it was customary to put an enhanced value on the farm produce, on the ground that it was superior to any to be got in the market, and no doubt it was. This year, owing to the general financial depression, we have been forced to cut down our expenditure on the farm and to supply our crops at ordinary market rates to the stallions ; this, of course, decreases the farm income very much, but still we are able to show a balance of Rs. 3,579-9-5 to our credit on the year's working of the farm, being an increase of Rs. 1,258-10-4 on the savings of last year.&quot; 250. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, states :59 Impey. &quot; One-fourth of an acre was sown in February ; three cuttings were got from it up to July when it was left for seed. This is a good crop, horses like it much and improve in condition owing to the large quantity of sugar it contains.&quot; Sundhio Jowa- ree. &quot; The seed was sent by Mr. Mollison from Bombay for trial; 15 seers seed was sown broad cast on one-third of an acre of land, well manured, on the 27th June 1894 ; all the seed germinat- ed and the crop was a good one ; the stalks being much thinner than Impey or the country Churree but not as sweet as impey. The seed cobs were small and did not yield much seed, I consider this is a good crop for cattle as the stalks are thin and when dry, are not so hard and woody as the ordinary kurby. I regret to say the stalks were destroyed by rain and high winds and so were unfit for feed, though a small quantity of the seed has been saved. Queen of the Prairie Field Corn. &quot; A small patch was sown on the 26th June 1894 ; the seed germinated well and the plants looked strong and healthy, but the soil here is not rich enough for this variety of maize, as each plant has from 3 to 6 cobs and the plants are not supplied with sufficient nutriment to bring the cobs to perfection, hence they were small and the grain was not well developed. Millets. &quot; The two varietiesPART IPART I.64 4 to 5 weeks previous to being received into the Laboratory Hospital, consequently the success of our treatment was not so marked as it otherwise might have been, had we been able to treat the animals within a few days of the disease making itself manifest. Nevertheless, the undermen- tioned cases are the only successful ones recorded up to the present date. &quot; The horse65 &quot;It has been found in the Laboratory Hospital that by giving kaunji* to the animal, morning and evening, directly after the arsenic, the abovementioned symptoms have not made their appearance. Consequently it would be advisable to give kaunji to all animals under treatment for surra, from the commencement of the administration of arsenic.&quot; &quot; * Linseed and rice, of each ½ lb. boil in water ¾ of an hour, and add water to make up 10 pints. &quot; Daily microscopic observations of the blood should be made, and the number of organisms recorded on a chart, for ready reference, together with the temperature, pulse, and respiration of the animal, three times in the day, viz., at 8 A.M., 1 P.M., and 5 P.M.&quot; &quot; Most animals will take the medicine in a pint to two pints of water from a bucket without any trouble. If this be found occasionally impracticable, the arsenic can be mixed with the corn and bran in the form of liquor arsenicalis, but in obstinate cases the medicine will have to be administered to the animals in the form of a bolus or in a draught. &quot; Acute desquammative nephritis is a common complication of surra, but it must not contra-indicate the administration of arsenic, although the maximum doses cannot be maintained, otherwise the animal will have a relapse and ultimately succumb to the disease.&quot; &quot; Animals suffering from surra usually have voracious appetites, and this condition can easily be accounted for when we consider that the nourishment is sapped from the blood by the millions of hæmatozoa which are present in the circulation during the presence of each paroxysm of fever. All these organisms have partially to be sustained before the host is able to utilize any of the nourishment present in the body fluids for the preservation of its own system. The rapidity with which animals suffering from surra do lose weight and condition, -testifies to the terribly unequal conflict which is being fought between host and parasites, and which may be described as a 'stampede for existence.' It has been found by practical experience that the following quantities of hay, corn, &c., are necessary for an Australian horse weighing 1,000 lbs. and upwards, when suffering or recovering from surra, for on this diet the animals keep in fair condi- tion and during convalescence put on flesh rapidly :PART I.PART I.70 The Secretary being absen from Bombay, the Under-Secretary was con- ferred with, but later in the year the Secretary71 disease, cattle breeding, &c., in various districts of the Punjab.

Imperial Bacteriologist.72 During the year under review it was decided to abolish the post of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Central Provinces and Berar, in order to furnish another European Officer for the Bombay Veterinary College without adding to the cadre of the Department. At the same time it was stated in a Despatch to the Secretary of State for India, dated 31st July 1894, that it would not be necessary to deprive the Central Provinces and Hyderabad of their Veterinary Officer, so long as only one civil Veterinary Officer was on furlough, in view of the fact that two furlough appointments have been provided for the Department. It was further stated &quot; At present there is no probability that more than one officer will be on furlough during the next 12 months&quot;. Veterinary Captain Short, who held the appointment, having proceeded on leave, was appointed as one of the furlough officers, and on return from leave, resumed the appointment in Central Provinces and Berar. From one cause or another this dual appointment has not proved a success, and Veterinary Captain Short having been invalided to England, these provinces are now without their Veterinary Officer. I regret that the second furlough appointment alluded to in above quoted Despatch has not been filled up, but it is to be hoped that on the conclusion of the operations in Chitral, this officer, who is now supernumerary to the Army Veterinary Department, will be appointed. This will enable the work to be carried on in Central Provinces and Berar. General Remarks. Remounts for Native Cava- lry. 262. During the year under review, an attempt was made to give effect to the proposal put forward in last year's Annual Administration Report that stock likely to prove fit for Native Cavalry remounts should be collected at different centres at other times than when shows or fairs are held. With this view, a circular was issued by the Adjutant General in India to all General Officers Commanding, for the information of all Bengal and Pun- jab Cavalry regiments. This circular contained paragraphs 325 and 326 of last year's Annual Administration Report, and the officers commanding these regi- ments were asked to state what districts and what time of the year would be most suitable for them to visit the different centres at which stock would be collected. It is to be regretted that this important step was not more warmly responded to by the Native Cavalry, as it would, in all probability, have done much to check the dealer class. Replies have only been received from 6 regi- ments, and of these 6, only two from the Bengal Cavalry, the remaining 4 having been received from the Punjab Cavalry and Queen's Own Corps of Guides. In order to meet the wishes of these officers who have expressed their readiness to give the scheme a fair trial, arrangements are being made to collect stock in the districts of Meerut and Dera Ghazi Khan, and it is also hoped that the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana will also assist in the matter. 263. During the year under review, a letter bearing on the subject of the purchase of grey horses for Native Cavalry, which was written by my pre- decessor shortly before his retirement, was issued by the Adjutant General in India with a circular memorandum in which His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief expressed his opinion that horses otherwise suitable should not be rejected merely for color. I doubt from what I have observed whether any appreciably greater number of grey horses has been bought this year. The Government of India further decided that first class grey stallions should not be rejected, but in view of the objections felt against grey remounts by some Commanding Officers, they did not consider it advisable to pur- chase any large number of stallions of this color. During 1894-95, no grey stallions were brought for Imperial or District Board purposes.
73 Special Judging Committees. 364. The recommendation which has so frequently been made by this Department to the effect that special Judging Committees should be appointed to visit the different horse shows and fairs in the North-Western Provinces, and Punjab, has been given effect to during the year, and it is hoped that they will assemble during the coming cold season. Provision has been made for judging of stock to be carried out by these Committees at the following shows:74 In order to discourage the dealer as much as possible, it was also decided to restrict the competition in remount classes to animals purchased from bonâ fide breeders, and to prevent dealers from taking part in such competitions. In connection with the remount classes, it was further decided that the competition in these classes should take place as scon as the majority of the purchasers intimated to the Secretary of a horse show that they had finished their purchases. By this, remounts are not detained at shows longer than is necessary and breeders of remounts are not debarred from competition as was frequently the case. Judging of the Remount class. 266. Complaints are made by District Officers that Purchasing Officers re- move the remounts bought at shows, without giving the Judging Committee an opportunity of having them brought before them. There can now be no excuse for their doing so, as arrangements have been made and all District Officers, with one exception, have been solicitous to give effect to the new system by which remounts are judged at any time that is most convenient to the majority of the Purchasing Officers. This should obviate all difficulties. It is, of course, very essential that breeders, who keep their stock to a proper age, should derive the benefits of the money awarded for prizes in the remount class, but still, it was necessary to guard the interests of the Native Cavalry and to ensure their not being put to any extra expense by having to keep their remounts at the show longer than was necessary. The. careful carrying out of the new order will meet the case. The exception alluded to above, as being the only one in which the new order was disregarded, occurred in Jacobabad in Sindh ; here the remounts purchased by the Remount Agent were detained, not only to allow them to be judged, but also to be paraded with the prize winners. The matter, being one of serious moment, affecting, as it did, not only the Purchasing Officer but also the breeder, the case was reported to the Government of Bombay, who have directed the attention of officers concerned to the wishes of the Government of India on the subject, and have requested them to carefully observe the rules laid down. Prizes for Re- mounts at Horse Fairs & Shows. 267. During the year under review, effect has been given to the new rule that prizes for remounts at horse shows are to be reserved for breeders, and that such as have been purchased from dealers are not allowed to compete. I feel convinced that this alteration will do much to induce the breeders to keep their young stock to that age at which it will be fit for remounts. Discretionary power has to be given to Judging Committees to decide whether exhibitors should be allowed to compete or not, as frequently zemindars, and this is speci- ally the case in the North-Western Provinces, purchase young stock and rear it. These men, although not breeders in the literal sense of the word, should be encouraged, and are not the class of exhibitors whom it is sought to prevent from competing in the remount class. It is the dealer proper, who puchases a full-grown horse from a zemindar with a view of selling it on the first oppor- tunity, that we wish to discourage. At no shows attended by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, were any objections raised to the working of the new rule, except at that one held at Jacobabad in Sindh. Here, the Bombay Government, advised by the Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, issued a Resolution to the effect that the proposed change in Notes 3 and 4 of the rules for the guidance of Judging Committees need not be made applicable to the Sindh horse show. This decision has been arrived at on the grounds that the alteration would interfere with the trade in Northern horses, but as the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, states that the main object of the dealer in attending a show is to sell and not with a view of competing for prizes, or in any way to interfere with the legitimate local breeder, I fail to see how the introduction of the new rule would in any way interfere with the Northern Horse Trade.
75 Extension of Horse and Mule Breeding in Mysore, Rajpu- tana, Central Provinces and Berar, Central India and Kashmir. 268. During the year under review, information was sought for from Central Provinces, Berar, Mysore, and Ajmere-Merwara, as to the possibility of extend- ing horse and mule breeding. The questions referred were :76 The whole question of stallions for Rajputana has been most carefully con- sidered by the Agent to the Governor General in consultation with the District Officers, and it has been decided to remove the stallion from Deoli and to retain the one at Ajmere. The Municipality of Beawar has also purchased an Arab pony to serve the smaller mares. Before removing the Deoli stallion from Rajputana, the question as to the advisability of locating him at Kekri, which is in the centre of the Jagir states and the head-quarters of a District Magis- trate, will again be referred to the Agent to the Governor General. The Officer Commanding, Deoli Irregular Force, recommends that, in the event of the horse stallion being removed, he should be replaced by a donkey stallion. Should there be any likelihood of the latter's services being utilized, I shall gladly fall into the views expressed by that officer. Central India. 272. The question of horse breeding in the Central India Agency has already been referred to. The possibility of extending mule breeding in this part of India was referred to the Agent to the Governor General, but from his reply he is of opinion that it would be useless to try it. In his report he states that mule breeding has been brought to the notice of the Native Chiefs of Central India. He further adds :77 identical to those required for Native Cavalry, and that the competition would certainly have a prejudicial effect on the latter, rendering it all the more difficult for them to obtain remounts. With a view of ascertaining to what extent the various States were in a position to help, and also of discovering whether the Chiefs would be willing to assist, I visited, with the sanction of the Government of India, the whole of the Native States situated in the Punjab, and the principal ones of Rajput- ana, including the Eastern States, viz., Dholepore, Bhurtpore, and Karauli, and can only record my hearty appreciation of the kindly manner in which I was received and the promises of assistance obtained from all the Chiefs, especially from those whose territories lie in the Punjab. I purpose giving a short outline of the material on which we have to work and the amount of assistance likely to be afforded. I shall take each State in the same order in which I visited it. Bahawalpore. 275. This State has already done something in the direction of horse breed- ing but its stallions have hitherto not been up to the mark, consisting, as they do, mainly of country-breds bred in the stud. A waler and two small Arabs have also been employed. At my request the State obtained 3 small Arabs of the stamp bought for District Boards, these, by serving the smaller mares, will undoubtedly do good. In addition to these stallions, 6 are said to be posted in the districts for the purpose of covering zemindari mares, these I hope to be able to inspect on a future occasion. Home Stud.78 Mule breeding appears to be popular; 4 donkeys are now employed, these Jacks have covered 263 mares during the past year. Fifty-seven mares were covered by the horse stallions. A small show was held at Kapurthala from 18th to 24th February 1895, but owing to the fact that it was suddenly antedated, it was not as large as was anticipated. 182 horse stock competed for prizes offered by the State. Of these, 115 were mares fit for horse and mule breeding. Maler Kotla. 277. This small State has already done something towards horse breeding, but the two stallions employed are in no way calculated to improve the class of horses in the State. They are not even liked by the zemindars, who, I was informed, took all their best mares to the adjoining district of Ludhi- anah to be served by the Government stallions there. The Superintendent of the State, Nawab Amiruddin Ahmed Khan C.I.E., afforded me every assistance and quite agreed with my views as to the stallions required to place horse and mule breeding on a more satisfactory basis, but owing to the fact that the State had commenced rais- ing Imperial Service Troops, he considered that it would be advisable to defer doing anything until the following year. During my inspection I saw 120 mares, the property of zemindars in the State; the majority of these were more fitted for mule than for horse-breeding. I therefore consider that it will be advisable to place one good galloway there and to restrict the main opera tions to mule breeding which has become so popular in the adjoining district of Ludhianah. Patiala. 278. That this State contains a great number of mares which at present are not utilized owing to the want of proper stallions, cannot be denied; still, it has done much to foster horse breeding. The steps taken may be placed under two headings, viz.:79 279. In this State horse breeding may be said to be confined to the stud Nabha. maintained by the Rajah. This, at present, consists of:80 majority of the mares inspected were either in foal or had foals at foot. I was further informed that those seen on my visit in no way represented the actual number of good mares in the State. The State possesses a stud at Kot Kapura which I inspected in company with His Highness the Rajah of Faridkote. I strongly recommended its aboli- tion, consisting as it does of very old worn out mares which are only an ex- pense to the State. Four stallions are kept by the State to cover the zemindari mares, but with one exception they are unfitted for stud work. In lieu of the stud, I recommended that His Highness should place good stallions at the disposal of his subjects and should purchase the young stock, running it on one of the &quot;Birs;&quot; this would ensure the State being supplied with a good class of horse fit for its requirements. A start has been made by the State purchasing a good Arab stallion and a donkey, and I trust to see this vastly extended as I feel that, situated as it is close to some of the best horse-breeding centres in the Punjab and possess- ing as it does within its boundaries a very great number of excellent mares, it could at least provide work for 6 stallions with profit to itself and with great advantage to its zemindars. Having now completed the review shewing the progress made towards the development of horse and mule breeding in the Native States whose terri- tories lie in the Punjab, I think that the assistance given by the various Chiefs must be looked upon with satisfaction. It is only natural to expect that per- fect order cannot be produced from chaos in one visit, and I feel that time alone will bring the system to anything like the perfection which it has reach- ed in the different districts of the Punjab. Three points I shall continue to impress upon the Chiefs, viz.:81 Four of the above are getting old and the Persian is a coarse horse unfitted for stud purposes. At my recommendation, 4 new stallions were purchased, viz., 2 Arabs and 2 Thoroughbred Australians. The latter were82 many of the mares which I inspected were well calculated to breed good mules. Five donkeys are now employed by the State, but as most of them are old, it was decided to replace them. I did not feel justified to recommend the State to go to the expense of purchasing expensive imported Jacks. I therefore purchased for them two excellent country-breds, and hope to be able to obtain more of this stamp. In time I see no reason why the Transport for both Cavalry and Infantry should not be obtainable in the State. Requirements of the State.83 A very great number of stallions are employed. At my first visit to the State, I saw 17; amongst which were Arabs, Thoroughbred English, Half - breds, Thoroughbred Australians, and Norfolk Trotters, besides 16 country- breds. These horses are used for various purposes when required. The stallions cover very few mares, the property of Jagirdars ; they are kept to cover mares at Jodhpore belonging to polo, racing, carriage stables, and in addition to this, 104 mares, belonging to the regiments, Imperial Service Troops, have been covered. I recommended the State to allot only a certain number of stallions for stud purposes and to keep them for this alone. This would ensure the selection of only good sires and the elimination of all badly shaped and unsound ones. In addition to the horse breeding operations at Jodhpore, the State owns a stud farm at Pali at which 120 mares are kept; here their produce, as well as that foaled at Jodhpore, are reared This stud farm has, however, suffered great loss from Surra which will be alluded to elsewhere; so great indeed has been the loss, that I am informed that the location of this stud has had to be changed. District Mares.84 Here we have every facility of breeding and rearing young stock, which would in time be able to furnish all remounts required by the State, but to do this, good stallions will have to be obtained, and these I trust to see employed shortly. Kerowlee. 288. This State cannot be looked upon as a horse-breeding centre ; still, the jagirdars are anxious to carry on the industry, as many of the mares inspected were in foal to the stallions kept by the Ulwar and Jeypore States. More is done in the way of rearing young stock, much of which is taken to the Fair annu- ally held at Batesar. There can be no doubt, from the nature of the country, that mule breeding would answer well in this State, but I fear native prejudice is very strong against it. The State of Ulwar is, however, setting a good example in this direction, and I feel that it only requires that a few mules should be sold at remunerative prices, to ensure the rapid spread of the industry. General Re- marks- 289. Having now reviewed horses breeding, as it exists at present, in the Native States which have been visited during the year, it must, I think, be grant- ed that they possess the means of making their Imperial Service Troops self- supporting in the way of remounts, without having to purchase in our fairs to the detriment of the Native Cavalry. The home studs cannot, with the exception of that of Ulwar, be considered as likely to provide many remounts. The direction which the States should therefore take should be that of placing good stallions in their districts for the use of zemindari mares, the purchase of the young stock, and its rearing in runs set apart for this pur- pose. Naturally time will be required to effect this, but provided some progress is made annually, the object in view, viz., that of obtaining a sufficient number of remounts in each State to replace casualties in Imperial Service Cavalry, will gradually be arrived at. Popularity of the Brand. 290. It is occasionally stated that if the system of branding were abolished or if the existing orders, preventing Cavalry Officers from purchasing branded mares, were relaxed, horse breeding would develop to a much greater extent than it does at present. In other words, it is occasionally urged that the system of branding is unpopular. During the year under review, I have attended 18 horse shows and fairs in Bombay, Sindh, Baluchistan, North-Western Provinces, and North and South Punjab, and have carefully watched the various Superintendents when engaged in branding. I can therefore speak with some authority on the subject and can safely assert that the system is most popular with the zemindars; their anxiety to obtain the brand is most marked and when it is refused, owing either to bad conformation or unsoundness, they are greatly disappointed. The fact, which has already been alluded to, viz., that certificates of barrenness can now be obtained with greater facility than was hitherto the case, removes one of the hardships complained of. 291. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states with reference to the popularity of the brand :85 The, system of branding cannot, of course, be adopted in a newly developed district, as the zemindars fail to grasp its meaning, attributing to it some ulterier motive or some wish on the part of Government to seize the young stock. This, however, rapidly vanishes. Thus, the Deputy Commissioner of Hardoi, in asking for the services of a stallion for his district, asked that the system of branding should not be insisted on for 2 years. This was sanctioned for 12 months, on the under- standing that no unbranded mares were to be allowed the services of the Imperial stallion unless they have been inspected by a District Officer. Sanction has also been accorded for the relaxation of the system in the Districts of Peshawar and Kohat, in order to endeavour to develop horse breed- ing in these districts. A stallion having lately been sent to Ajmere, the same indulgence was sought and granted. At this station no difficulty is experienced as the stallion is located on the Veterinary School premises, and all mares are inspected by Veterinary Captain Hagger, the Principal of that Institution. To summarize, the services of 4 stallions are allowed to unbranded mares in the Punjab, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and Rajputana, as a ten- tative measure for one year, in order to endeavour to develop new dis- tricts. During the year under review, the question of increasing the popu- larity of the Government stallions and of endeavouring to obtain better results than have hitherto been obtained has been carefully considered by the Bombay Government. 292. The Commissioners of Divisions and in Sindh and other officers were consulted, and after due consideration of their reports, the following Resolu- sanction on the branding system was passed by the Government of Bombay :86 293. The Government of India, after carefully considering the matter, sanctioned a modified relaxation of the rules referring to branding, and restrict- ed such relaxation to the Presidency only. Such relaxation is, however, only to be in force as a tentative measure, pending the submission of a report by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, on the working of the scheme. It was further stated that the Government of India prefer to make no distinction in the services of certain stallions : this, of course, refers to that part of the Resolution of the Bombay Government in which it was laid down that the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, should be empowered to reserve certain popular stallions like &quot; Tam O'Shanter &quot; for mares specially selected by him. The Resolution adding, &quot; this reservation would be some safeguard against sires capable of getting racing stock being put to anything unworthy of them.&quot; The object of all horse breeding in India should, in my opinion, be to obtain suitable remounts for British and Native Cavalry, and racing stock should not in any way be considered. The relaxation sanctioned by the Government of India was to the effect that Assistant Collectors, District Superintendents of Police, and Assistant District Superintendents of Police, who were specially selected, should have the power to grant covering certificates ; that these certificates should qualify for service, once only, by the stallion named ; that a list of certificates granted should be sent to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, through the Collector of the District; that the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, should inspect certificated mares each year, branding such as are found suitable. 294. The report on the working of the system will be awaited with interest, as in 1892-93 similar relaxation of the branding system was sanctioned by the Government of India in North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Punjab, Rajputana, Central India, and Beluchistan ; and the year under review is the first occasion in which the working of the system has been reported on, and it will be observed that, as far as at present advised, it is not one, the extension of which can in any way be advocated. It will be noticed that in only two districts of the Punjab has the power to grant covering certificates been exercised by District Officers, viz., Rohtak and Dera Ghazi Khan. Remarking on the system, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states :87 &quot; I find that in the majority of cases the mares selected for these certificates are not only mis- shapen and inferior, but unsound and very often old and practically worn out, the owners of which half starve them and therefore can never be expected to get any decent stock from them. &quot; There are many cases that have come under my observation where the owner having had a certificate granted him has had his animal covered by a Government stallion, and then refused to have her branded. &quot; Considerable difficulty has been experienced in getting these mares in for inspection on appoint- ed dates. At three inspections held in the Rohtak district, up to which time 60 certificates had been given, out of the sixty, 44 animals came up. From the owners of the 44 mares only 33 certificates were collected, practically only one-half of those issued. Of the 33 men who had these documents. 4 refused the brand altogether and the certificates were re-collected. One man refused the brand pending proof of the mare being in foal. Of the whole 60, it will be seen that 28 were eventually branded. At a place called Sampla, a zemindar brought his mare up with a certificate, he had her served by a Government sire and now refused to allow the mare to be branded. Immediately after this, another man stepped forward and asked that he might have his mare served by a Government horse, but he particularly stipulated that she was not to be branded. When I told him that it was quite impossible to comply with his request, he then wanted to know for what reason his neighbour, who had come up just before him, had been better favored than himself, and failed to see why the same privilege should not be accorded to him. This view of the question should, I consider, be always borne in mind. &quot; Some of the mares selected for these certificates in this district are, in my opinion, a disgrace to horse breeding and every thing connected with it. &quot;Under the old system in vogue, in the old Horse Breeding Operations, when owing to the fact of one officer having to travel over a very much larger area of country than he could possibly do justice to, and where in some cases a district was not inspected for 2 or 3 years, I can quite see that the issue of such certificates would have been productive of much good, but under the pre- sent regime, where a Veterinary Officer visits each district under his charge at least once a year, and in the majority of cases holds an inspection at nearly every tehsil, I consider their issue to be quite unnecessary, in fact, prejudicial to the true interests of horse breeding. I firmly believe it tends to render the brand unpopular, and it has been proved that the men will accept these certi- ficates readily, have their mares mated with Government sires, and then evade the brand by re- fusing to bring their mares up for inspection or by declining to have them branded. &quot; The brand is sufficiently popular in some districts, and I would rather advocate confining Government stallions to those districts where it is so, and where really good mares are to be found to mate with them, than to reduce its popularity by issuing these certificates in such numbers in backward districts. More than half the mares to which these certificates have been given are only fitted by reason of their conformation or unsoundness for mating with District Board horses or donkey stallions.&quot; The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, reports as follows:88 295. From careful consideration of the above recorded facts, we can con- clude :89 &quot; These false entries could only be made with the consent or by carelessness on the part of the zilladars, as they are supposed to constantly check the darindahs' registers, and I am very glad that in this case you dismissed the zilladar and sanctioned the stand being broken at Rardhana, as I believe it has had a very wholesome effect on the other zilladars and darindahs throughout the districts. &quot;As suggested by you, I then took 20 mares from the covering returns of each zilladar and submitted them for verification to the Collector. Seven of these have been returned to me and one is yet outstanding. Of the 7 returned, in no case have all the entries been found to be correct. In many of them the errors are not very, serious, such as the correct color of the mare not been given. The substituting of the son's name for that of the father, and the syces name for that of his master. In the Budaon district, out of 20 mares submitted, 9 were found to be incor- rect, and some of the men supposed to have mares covered could not be traced at all. On the other hand, on several occasious application has been made to me by zemindars to grant produce certificates for their foals, the zilladars being unable to so, as the mares covering had not been entered in the darindah's register, and the darindahs, in a couple of cases, came forward and admitted that they forgot to make the entry at the time. Thus it will be seen that the covering returns are far from correct, a number of the mares shown as covered have never been covered at all; whereas, a number that have been covered have not been entered in the register. It is hoped that now the patwaris are going to submit returns, we may be able to check those of the zilladars and arrive at more accurate results.&quot; It will be seen that every endeavour has been made to obtain correct statistics, and although the Department has failed, still, the measures adopted, although they may appear severe, are such as will in time lead to the attain- ment of this most important end. 298. On the question of the registration of produce, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states:90 &quot; The patwaris' returns regarding the coverings, foalings, &c., have been for the most part, incorrect, but that was only to be expected at the commencement of a new scheme with the working of which they were unacquainted. A new form has now been adopted, and I believe when the Patwaris get to understand its meaning, their returns will be of great value to us. The returns already furnished have been of use in giving the number of big and small mares in different districts, thus enabling me in a couple of instances to send stallions to new districts where I did not previously know there would be work for them.&quot; It was only to be expected that a system, involving the submission of new forms of returns by a large number of men unacquainted with the work would at the onset be a little confused, but it is felt that ultimately it will be productive of much good. To give some idea of the magnitude of the work undertaken, it may be mentioned that in the Punjab alone 8,630 patwaris are employed and that returns have to be submitted by them all. The system of verification by District officials of about 20 mares annually from the returns received from the zilladars having been found to be so successful in the North-Western Provinces, the same system will be adopted during 1895-96, and the Punjab Government will also be ask- ed to introduce it in that province. Darindah sys- tem in N. W. Provinces. 300. By this system is meant that some zemindar or rais of a district under- takes to build a stable according to the standard plan, at his own expense and furnishes a security to the extent of Rs. 250/; for this and any further trouble, he receives Rs. 3 per horse and Re. 1 per donkey in addition to the cost of feed and keep. The system adopted in the Punjab is far better : in this province, Government build the stable and the horses are in charge of the District Authorities. Feeling that the system existing in North-Western Provinces required attention, stringent orders were issued on this point. One stand at Rardhana, already alluded to when speaking of unreliable statistics, was visited by the Superintendent and myself in August, and as the charges brought against the Darindah were clearly proved, this stand was broken up. Again, the Darindah of Malickpur in the Bulandshahr district neglected the horse and donkey in his charge and allowed them one seer of gram daily, although 7 seers were charged for. This darindah was fined the amount of his account for 2½ months and his stand was abolished. Almost a worse case occurred at Kasimpur in the district of Aligarh. Here the darindah really starved the horse. This man was fined Rs. 30 and his stand was abolished. The Collector of the district also decided that this darindah should forfeit Rs. 100 of his security. There can be no doubt that the majority of the darindahs endeavour to live on the amount made by depriving the Government stallions of their food. This remark, however, does not apply to a certain number who take the stallions for the sake of &quot; izzat &quot; and who are very anxious to foster horse breeding in their neighbourhood; amongst others, might be mentioned the Raises of Aligarh and Mohomed Yakub Khan of Khurja. Remarking on this subject, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states :91 and so on, almost every horse that comes into depôt has lost weight, showing that he has been neglected whilst away. Only the initial outlay would be so great, I would recommend that darindahs should be done away with altogether and a system adopted the same as that which appears to work so well in the Punjab.&quot; It is to be hoped that the stringent measures adopted will be the means of checking these irregularities. Another system which has hitherto been allowed to exist and which is found to work very badly will be discontinued. I allude to that in which, when a darindah dies, the stand is allowed to remain in the hands of his widow, or his son who may be a minor; it is found that in both these cases no supervision whatever is exercised over the stand. This Department is deeply indebted to many of the Collectors of the North-Western Provinces for the great assistance afforded to it by them, but it was found that others did not take sufficient interest in the matter and especially failed to impress upon the District officials the necessity of taking every opportunity of inspecting the stands when they were in camp. On representations being made to the Government of these provinces, a circular has been issued by the Chief Secretary to all Commissioners; the following being an extract :GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

North-West- ern Provinces and Oudh. 318. Owing to the prevalence of glanders at so many military stations in these Provinces, I directed enquiries to be made to endeavour to trace the sources from which the disease is derived. The districts mainly affected are Allahabad, Lucknow, Fyzabad, Cawnpore and Bareilly. All the District Authorities, how- ever, appear unanimous in stating that the disease does not exist in their dis- tricts. The Deputy Commissioner, Fyzabad, however, remarks, &quot; even if it had existed I do not understand what steps could have been taken to eradi- cate it, for the Glanders and Farcy Act has not yet been extended to this district.&quot; Glanders also appeared on the Saharunpore and Dehra dâk line, but for- tunately it was confined to one chowki. Three cases occurred but owing to the fact that the Glanders and Farcy Act is in operation on this road, prompt measures were taken which appear to have entirely arrested the progress of the disease. Another case occurred in the North-Western Provinces which is very in- structive, bearing as it does on the question of glanders in the Bombay stables, and also on the advisability of extending the Act to the whole of India. A pony, the property of the Rajah of Mursan, whose residency is close to the Cantonment of Muttra, purchased a number of ponies in Bombay ; shortly after their arrival, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, whilst making his inspection in this district, discovered that one was affected with glanders. He recommended that the one so affected should be immediately destroyed and that the other eleven ponies, that had been received from Bom- bay, should be isolated. This the Rajah of Mursan refused to do. The animal, is reported to have died, but the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, entertains grave suspicions that it was removed. As before stated, this case is most instructive. 1st.105 As already stated in the review of the Sonepore fair, a case of glanders was detected. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, who attend- ed this fair, reports as follows :106 Cavalry Regiments and Mountain Batteries by the Adjutant General in India, to the following effect:PART II.PART II.110 the same regularity, nor can the diagnosis in all cases be relied upon.

Table M (page xcvii) gives the details regarding the reported out- breaks of contagious disease in India and Burma. Burma is the only province with a staff of Veterinary Assistants directly under the supervision of the Provincial Veterinary Officer, and is hence the only one from which we can expect to derive information of any value regard- ing disease. The following is the report of Veterinary Captain G. H. Evans, the Provincial Veterinary Officer. CATTLE DISEASE111 Rinderpest.112 Maungmya District.

During the time I was with the Pun- jab Government the Deputy Commissioner of Kangra, in answer to enquiries made by me, stated that no disease was reported from Kulu, but on my visiting the sub-division I found that the cattle were dying by thousands from rinderpest. This will give some idea as to the accuracy of the statistics received. With reference to this point the Superintendent, Bombay, states :118 antiseptic properties of any value. Veterinary Captain Gunn reports the follow- ing results of his experiments :119 of horses and cattle, more especially for animals belonging to the poorer classes." Hoshiarpur dispensary.120 Remarks. 334. Very satisfactory progress has been made under this heading during the year. In Bombay the total number of animals treated has risen from 9,843 last year to 13,936 during the present, and the percentage of cases cured and relieved is much higher. It is gratifying to find that suitable buildings for the reception of patients are being erected at all dispensary head-quarters, and that the general public are anxious to promote the welfare of these institutions and to assist them with funds. The dispensaries in the South Punjab have also done good work, nearly all of them showing an improvement over last year. The establishment of dispensaries is the first step towards showing the people the benefit to be derived from having their animals properly cared for, to gain their sympathies with our methods of treatment and to overcome their superstition and ignorance with regard to cattle diseases. Institutions of this kind, showing as they have done during the year a very substantial result, deserve every encouragement, and doubtless all districts will shortly see the necessity of opening them for the benefit of the ryots.

An European Resident Officer is not considered necessary at the former Institution; and having frequently inspected the hospital, I feel satisfied that the practice is most carefully attended to, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, I consider that it would be advisable to continue the system which has hitherto been in force in Bombay, viz., that of entertaining a native gra- duate of the College for the performance of these duties. Lahore Veter- inary College. 342. This Institution has continued to do the good work which has cha- racterized it for so many years. The summer session commenced on 10th May 1894. The number of students who entered the College was 48, viz., 18 Military, 15 scholarship hold- ers, and 15 free students. The winter session commenced on 15th October 1894. The senior class numbered 55; the junior class numbered 47, which was subsequently reduced to 39 owing to deaths and students leaving of their own accord, or dismissed for irregular attendance. The total number of students in the College, including 1st and 2nd year men, was 94; an increase of 10 over last year; this testifies to the popularity of the Institution, but at the same time I consider the number almost too great for the teaching staff employed. The final examination took place from 3rd to 10th April 1895. The Exa- mining Board was composed as follows:133 last year, giving an average of about 32 daily. The out-patients, both equine and bovine, are always the ones to be encouraged, as they afford the most valuable material for clinical instruction to the students. " The number of surgical operations was 671, or an increase of 225 over last year." The total number of in-door and out-patients shows and increase of 1,119 over last year, which must be considered very satisfactory. During the year under review, a scheme has been formulated for the training of nalbunds, totally independent of the College course. Is is estima- ted that 9 months will be required to train nalbunds who have had some previous experience, and it is proposed that local bodies or regiments sending men to the College to be trained, should pay a fee of Rs. 20 to the nalbund foreman for the instruction of the men sent by them; this will ensure their being properly trained. Already a large number of District Boards have inti- mated their intention to send nalbunds to be trained. As the class is naturally limited, preference should be given to District Boards of the Punjab, who are willing to have men taught at this College. Already one has joined from the Kurnal district. It will be most beneficial to Government stallions to have properly trained nalbunds in each district. The amount derived from fees and paid into the Government Treasury was Rs. 5,095-10-0, being an increase of Rs. 1,268-6-6 over last year. During the year, Veterinary Lieutenant Sullivan, who was Assistant Pro- fessor, was invalided home; Veterinary Lieutenant Cranford, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, was deputed to do duty at the College ; Veterinary Lieutenant Martin was appointed in November last, and is well reported on by the Principal. The following test-books have been added during the year, by the follow- ing authors, to those already published :134 I would also specially mention the teaching staff of the College :135 on the structure and Physiology of the horse's foot, and at the end of the term, all, except one, passed as competent shoers. " The staff of this institution is now complete, and consists of the Principal with the following Assistants : 136 Notices, offering free treatment for the animals of zemindars and other more or less indigent persons, have been widely circulated, and Political Officers- have been urged to use their influence to induce Durbars to avail themselves of the hospital attached to the school, for the treatment of sick and lame animals. It is therefore to be hoped that the hospital practice, especially as it. refers to cattle will increase during the next few years. Burma Veteri- nary School. 345. This school appears to have done the same good work which it has hitherto done, under the supervision of Veterinary Captain Evans, who reports as follows:137 I deem it advisable to record his opinion which is as follows:138 is not complete, and even when it is accepted by the various Local Gov- ernments, years will elapse before the full strength of subordinates necessary to carry out the work connected with cattle disease and breeding, is employed. The Punjab is the only province in which the subordinate establishment may be said to be fairly complete, but as will be shown hereafter, the super- vising staff is insufficient. On this point the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, states :139 On this subject, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, reports as follows:140 Ahmedabad.PART IIPART IIPART II.PART II.148 in the districts, Jacks of a good stamp are always maintained in every mule breeding district.
