In addition, Mr. Malik attended the meetings or the Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Federation Congress, the Develop- ment Board meetings, Bhagalpur and Tirhut Divisions, at Purnea and Daulatpur and the departmental conference at Patna. During his ordinary tours, he visited several seats of outbreaks and carried out propaganda for removing the scrub bulls by the Burdizzo (bloodless) method of castration. 7. During the year, the electric installation for the office of the Deputy Director at Muzaffarpur was completed, while sanction was given to provide it with a telephone as well. CENTRAL RANGE. 8. Major Riley held charge of the range in addition to his duties as Director and Veterinary Adviser up to the 22nd May 1929 after which it was placed under Babu Nilmoni Chatterji who performed the duties of a Range Officer with certain exceptions in regard to leave and transfer of the subordinate staff. 9. During the year Babu Nilmoni Chatterji inspected most of the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries in the range. In addition, he visited 389 villages for verifying the work of the touring veterinary assistant surgeons, attended an outbreak of Johne's disease and bovine contagious abortion at Monghyr Dairy Farm, supervised the "serum simultaneous" inoculation against rinderpest at the Patna Cattle Farm, acted as a judge at the Bihta Exhibition and as member and Secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board and also gave lectures.
3 to the cadets of the Hazaribagh Police Training school on common contagious diseases of cattle. He spent 150 days on tour and travelled 2,892 miles by road. ORISSA RANGE. 10. Rai Sahib P. N. Das held charge of the range throughout the year. During the period, he inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries except Phulbani and Ghatsila, checked the work of touring veterinary assistant surgeons in the mufassal, visited many villages where outbreaks of contagious cattle diseases had occurred, checked the inoculation and castration figures and personally attended some outbreaks. In addition, be also attended some meetings of the district boards and Divisional Development Boards, the annual general meeting of the Co- operative Central Bank, Kujang, and several other meetings, such as those of the governing body for the proposed co-operative training institute, rural educational bias school, Chowliaganj Goshala, Provincial Co-operative Congress, all held at Cuttack, a meeting of the Selection Board and a conference of gazetted officers of the Department held at Patna. 11. The "serum simultaneous " inoculation against rinderpest which was carried out for the first time in the range at the Government Agricultural Farm, Cuttack, was personally con- ducted by him. He also attended an outbreak of skin disease among the Cuttack Jail cattle, examined some cases of equine surra at Jamshedpur, inspected a number of goshalas and pinjrapoles, the livestock of the agricultural farms at Khurda, Sambalpur, Kanke and Cuttack, and also the Khedda veterinary dispensary at Purnakote. 12. He was on tour for 189 days and travelled 3,513 miles by road in addition to the journeys by rail. 13. The electric installation for the office of the Deputy Director at Cuttack was sanctioned during the year and the work has since commenced. CHAPTER II. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 14. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College.4 and post-graduate hostels and Darwan's goomti, as well as the laying out of a garden and planting of shrubs in the college compound which were undertaken later, could not be finished within the year. These are now in progress. Messrs. Mansfield and Son, Calcutta, also completed the work of fitting, erection of gas plant and connections for internal water-supply according to the terms of their contract. The main work that remained to be done was that of water-supply, sanitation and drainage and electric installations to the buildings ; of these, the electric instal- lations were also completed within the year but as regards water-supply and sanitation, the work was delayed due to the late arrival of certain machinery. The whole work, including laying of distribution mains, internal pipings and fittings, pump chamber, water tower and staff quarters, has now been completed while all drains including gulley pits being constructed, sewers laid, the pumping station completed and the pumping plant installed it is expected that the sewerage system will be in operation as soon as the connection with the electric main is completed by the electrical department. 15. The total expenditure on buildings up to the end of May 1930 as furnished by the Executive Engineer, amounted to Rs. 5,8l,622 while the expenditure incurred on account of water supply, sanitation and drainage up to 31st March 1930, was Rs. 1,20,772. This is in addition to Rs. 49,069 paid to Messrs. Mansfield and Son, and Kb. 40,012 spent on electric installations. 16. The scheme for conservancy and street lighting, the work of which is to be conducted departmentally, is still under consideration. 17. In order to start the college on the 1st July 1930, it was considered necessary to recruit the Principal and the Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology and Research Officer about four months in advance. Both posts were therefore readvertised on improved terms sanctioned by Government and as a result Mr. R. T. Davis, i.v 8., Vice-Principal, Bengal Veterinary College, was recruited as principal. The other post remained vacant during the year. 18. On the recommendations of the two Selection Boards which met at Patna during 1923-29 and 1929-30 the following officers were recruited with effect from the date shown against each :5 Date. 2. Mr. G. N. Roy Chaudhury, G.B.V.C., Professor of Surgery and Obstetrios. 1st April 1930. 3. Mr. J. M. Lahiri, M.R C.V.S., Professor of Anatomy and Physiology. 5th May 1930. 4. Mr. M. B. Bose, M.SC., Lecturer on Biology and Chemistry. 1st January 1930. 5. Mr. S. I. H. Akbari, G.B.V.C., Lecturer in Materia Medica and Therapeutics. 1st April 1930. 19. Of these officers, the first three were appointed on contract on special rates of pay while the two lecturers were appointed permanently but on fixed pay of Rs. 250 per month each. The two Professors of Surgery and Obstetrics, and Anatomy and Physiology, as well as the Lecturer in Materia Medica and Therapeutics received practical training preliminary to their appointments. 20. Arrangements were also made during the year for filling up the posts of subordinate professional staff, the clerical as well as the menial staff required for the college. Most of these posts have since been filled. 21. The college has been opened with effect from the 1st July 1930. 22. Training at the Bengal Veterinary College.6 25. The results of annual examinations of the Bihar and Orissa students at the Bengal Veterinary College were as follows :7 Orissa range but due, mainly, to some severe outbreaks of rinder- pest having occurred in Cuttack district. It is, however, satisfac- tory to note that foot and mouth disease was on the decline in this range. Although no widespread outbreak was reported in the Central Range except one of foot and mouth disease, judging from the statistics available, the health of cattle in this range cannot be called satisfactory, as there has been an all round increase in the numbers of outbreaks, seizures and deaths. The conditions of North Bihar were, however, different. The diseases in that range appeared mostly in a mild form, while anthrax was not reported except in one district. 31. The incidence of different contagious livestock diseases is shown in the map enclosed. 32. The total number of outbreaks reported in the province was 6,660 in which 35,543 deaths were recorded, as compared with 6,852 outbreaks and 27,767 deaths recorded in 1928-29. The figure 6,660 includes 1,683 outbreaks of loot and mouth disease. Including 41,675 cases of this disease, the total number of animals affected in the above outbreaks was 1,11,080 compared with 1,1.4,566 of the previous year which shows a total decrease of 3,486 attacks. Help could be given by the staff in 5,846 outbreaks against 5,970 in the year 1928-29. 33. The statistics of the outbreaks of contagious diseases, etc., with reference to the area and cattle population of each range are shown below :8 37. Surra.9 and some adjoining villages rather badly. It lingered in these places for about six months before it could be controlled with the help of an extra staff. The disease did not assume its usual virulence in Cattack, Puri and Angul, i.e.. the districts in which it had taken its permanent seat in the past. And, speaking generally of Orissa, there has been a reduction of over twenty- four thousand cases compared with the previous year. The highest mortality (114 deaths) was, however, recorded in Puri although the number of attacks in that district was comparatively small. The reduction noticed in the Orissa range was partially counter- balanced by an increase of six thousand cases in the central range and also by a slight increase in the number in North Bihar. Altogether 41,675 animals were affected in 1,683 outbreaks, and out of these, 311 died during the year, compared with 59,780 attacks in 2,008 outbreaks and 22S deaths in the year 1928-29. 42. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.10 the previous year. Only 1 death was recorded in the Orissa Bange. 144 outbreaks were attended by the staff. The disease was confirmed by microscopical examination in the laboratories in each case. 44. Anthrax.11 a view to increasing the immunity of inoculation. The animals in a selected area were infected just before inoculation by smearing virulent saliva on the buccal and nasal mucous membranes. The results proved satisfactory but as the method involves certain amount of risk in operation, people Were unwilling to continue the experiment in more than one outbreak. 51. Serum simultaneous inoculation.12 57. Supply of sera and vaccines.13 and actually paid Rs. 25,868-6-0 towards meeting the cost in deserving cases, apart from the sum of Rs. 39,635-6-0 which they paid for sera and vaccines spent on Government estates. It is hoped that those boards which have not yet cleared up their arrears will do so as early as possible. NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 59. Opening of new dispensaries.14 62.

15 Government on account of acquisition of land and construction amounted to Us. 10,656 which has since been paid. 68. Number of patients treated.16 Bihar, 29,753 in Central and 14,103 in Orissa Range. As the figures show, there is no doubt that the Burdizzo method, though recently introduced, has become popular. The above figures have already been included in tables IV and V. CATTLE FARMS. 73.

17 calves. The decrease in the sale of milk was due to two facts, viz., the outbreak of foot and mouth disease as mentioned above and the increase in the rate from 1st November 1929 from 10 lbs. to 8 lbs. per rupee, on account of which some of the custo- mers discontinued taking milk. 79. The total area of land cultivated by the farm agency was 261 acres in addition to which 170 bighas were leased out at a'rental of Us. 2,122-7-0, out of which Rs. 1,773-11-0 was realized during the year and credited to Government. The whole amount could not be realized as the late manager leased out the land from 1st June 1929 to 31st May 1930 instead of 1st April 1929 to 31st March 1930 as was done in previous years. 80. Crops such as maize, juar, oats, gram, bajra and khesari were grown on the farm. The total outturn of monsoon crop was 29,549 maunds the value of which was Us. 7,594-13-0. The rabi crops such as oats and gram were harvested from 1st April 1930, so, they could not be shown in the report. The expenditure on cultivation was Rs. 12,919-12-0. 81. During the year under report, the Public Works Depart- ment completed the thrashing yard and did some petty repairs. 82. The total revenue of the farm amounted to Rs. 27,064-1-0 while the expenditure was Rs. 54,607-11-3 as shown in table IX including the payment for livestock, but not for building works done by the Public Works Department. 83. The great drawback of the farm is regarding water- supply. The farm has got its own oil engine and pump with channels for irrigation but it has to depend on the Irrigation Department for water which they cannot supply when required. The cultivation of green fodder is urgently necessary at the farm for the milch cows throughout the year. The increase and decrease of milk depends primarily on green fodder. 84. Horse breeding18 visited Sitamarhi fair. Due to scarcity and pollution of water, gastric troubles broke out. at Bhairoasthan fair both among men and animals. At the Bihta Rural and Agricultural Exhibition which was held this year on a larger scale, a veterinary section was organised by the Department. The exhibits of this section among other items of interest included bulls, bull calves, cows and heifers taken from the Patna cattle-breeding farm and also samples of fodder grown at the farm. His Excelleucy the Governor and Lady Stephenson paid a visit to it. The health of the animals brought to the fairs was, on the whole, satisfactory. 1,105 animals were booked to different places from the Sonepur district of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. The particulars of the fairs and shows are shown in tables XIII and XIV. CHAPTER V. PROVINCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. 86. There was no change in the personnel of the permanent cadre of the department the same three officers having continued to work throughout the year. Eai Sahib P. N. Das was however due to retire in May last but has been granted one year's extension. The sanction for the post of Special Officer, North Bihar Range, was continued for another year from 1st December 1929. Particulars of the officers recruited on contract for the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College have been noted in para- graph 18 of the report. The three Professors as well as the two lecturers hold gazetted rank. CHAPTER VI. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. 87. The number of veterinary inspectors employed was 13 as in the previous year. 88. As regards the two temporary inspectors appointed under the Cruelty to Animals Act, the services of Babu S. B. Sahay who was employed under the Patna City Muni- cipality, were transferred to them according to the foreign service rules for three years with effect from 1st April 1930. The municipality have agreed to bear the entire cost, of the officer including his leave and pension allowances. The term of the inspector employed under the Bihar and Orissa Society for
19 the Prevention of Cruelty to animals having expired on the 16th March 1930 the post was again sanctioned for one year, and the same officer, Maulavi A. U. Ahmed, held it up to the end of the year. 89. Babu M.M. Banerji, veterinary inspector, Hazaribagh circle was attached to the Patna Cattle Farm for about six months, while. Maulavi S. I. H. Akbari, veterinary inspector, Gaya circle, was deputed to the Prince of Wales Medical College, Patna, for three months. 90. On 1st April 1929, there were 123 veterinary assistant surgeons including the assistant employed under the Bettiah Raj. During the year, 6 Bihar and Orissa veterinary graduates joined the department making the number 129. Out of these, one assistant died, one resigned and one was on deputation to Angul as Khedda Office? ; so, at the end of the year, the staff employed in districts consisted of 126 assistants, i.e., 30 hospital and 96 touring. 91. The subordinate staff to each range was distributed as follows:20 93. The following table shows the number of slides examined and the diseases diagnosed in each range :21 95. Johne's disease and contagious abortion.22 CHAPTER IX, PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. 99. During the year 1,329 cases were seized or sent up under the Act in the three ranges with the result that 1,227 cases ended in convictions, compared with 1,014 and 918 cases, respectively, in 1928-29. 100. The inspector under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act employed under the Patna City municipality had 380 cases prosecuted out of which 324 ended in conviction and 56 cases were pending for trial when the year closed, against 400, 359 and 43, respectively, during the preceding year. The slight fall in the numbers is due to abatement of the crimes. A sum of Us. 2,885-12-0 was realised as fines from the cases instituted. This includes Rs. 180-8-0 from the pending cases of the previous year. 519 hackney carriages and ekka ponies were examined by the inspector in connection with the granting of licenses. 101. The work of the inspector employed under the Bihar and Orissa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was under close supervision of the Director throughout the year, who also acted as Honorary Treasurer to the Society. The inspector has his headquarters at Gaya from where he visits Bhagalpur, Purulia, Monghyr, Ranchi and other places. During the year he spent 140 days on tour and sent up 365 cases out of which 346 ended in conviction. A sum of Rs. 2,588 including Rs. 1,588 of the previous year was realised as fines. CHAPTER X. ROYAL COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE. 102. Except the opening of a veterinary college at Patna the scheme of which had originated in this Province long before the Commission was contemplated, none of the other recom- mendations could be carried out for want of funds. The crying need of the department is an increase of the subordinate staff. Unless this staff is sufficiently strengthened control of livestock diseases will prove a most difficult problem for the department. CHAPTER XI. GENERAL REMARKS. 103. Silo operation.23 Nagpur did not progress further but a new field was started at Khurda with the help of the Subdivisional Officer and sixteen pits were opened there with partial success. In the Kolhan and Porahat areas of Singhbhum district the villagers who were shown the method of preserving grass, filled up some pits of their own accord. In Angul this operation was conducted by the Agricultural Department. 104. Elephantkhedda.24 Hospital assistant surgeons.TABLE II.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1930-31 CHAPTER I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I held charge of the department as officiating Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government from 1st to 26th April and then again from 24th November 1930 to 31st March 1931. While on leave, Mr. J. S. Garewal, I.V.S., Live-stock Officer of the Punjab, whose services were lent by the Government of India, officiated during my absence. 2. Mr. D. Quinlan retired from service on 7th June 1930. The post of Director, Civil Veterinary Department and Veterinary Adviser to Government having fallen vacant, I was appointed substantively to it on two years' probation with effect from the date of my return from leave, i.e., 24th November 1930. 3. The work of the Central Range was done by Assistant Director, Babu Nilmoni Chattarji, under my direct supervision according to the re-arrangement of duties already approved by Government. 4. The second State scholar, Mr. Subrata Kumar Sen, B .SC. (Cal.), after taking his diploma at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, London, returned during the year and was appointed by Government as a Special Officer for one year from the 28th November 1930. He was attached to the head office of the department for training. It has been proposed to send him to the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, for a special course of training in Bacteriology extending over 2 months. 5. During the short period of five months, I visited 43 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries out of 126 in the Province, acted as an examiner at the annual examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College at Belgachia, and also as Examiner and Presi- dent of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board
2 during the first half-yearly professional examination of the subor- dinate staff. I further acted as an examiner and a member of the Board of Examiners of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. Besides, as the new Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College was to start from 1st July 1930, much preliminary office work in that connection had to be done, in addition to the usual supervision of the Patna Cattle Breeding Farm and the college equipment work before I proceeded on leave. I was on tour for 47 days and travelled 1,794 miles by road. 6. Mr. Garewal, during his incumbency for seven months, visited 54 veterinary institutions in the Province, attended a meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla, interviewed the students on behalf of Government and local bodies for admission to the first session of the New College at Patna, and acted as Examiner and President at the second half-yearly professional examination of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board. He also attended a meeting of the Selection Board at Ranchi in connection with the appointment of the Research Officer and Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology for the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College ; and visited the Sonepur fair. He was on tour for 58 days and travelled 1,267 miles by road. 7. Mr. S. K. Sen was employed on touring duty in order to enable him to know the conditions of the interior. During the four months of the year, he spent 64 days on tour, visited many important stations and thanas in Patna, Gaya, Monghyr, Bhagalpur and Santal Parganas districts, and travelled 1,138 miles by road. NORTH BIHAR RANGE. 8. Special Officer Mr. Ismail Malik was in charge of the range throughout the year. He spent 139 days on tour, travelled 3,907 miles by road in addition to railway journeys, inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries numbering 43, visited the Government Cattle farms, Pusa and Sipaya as well as the important fairs and shows, acted as one of the judges at the Sitamarhi, Khagra and Sonepur fairs, and assisted in organizing a scheme for starting a livestock exhibition at Sonepur. 9. Mr. Malik also attended the meeting of the Develop- ment Board, Tirhut Division, held at Madhubani and carried on the usual propaganda for removing scrub bulls and educating the public on veterinary matters. He, moreover, delivered lectures on animal husbandry, the prevention of cruelty to animals, and on the care of cattle during epidemics.
3 10. Due to repeated revision of the estimate, the electric pump sanctioned for the laboratory could not be fitted up during the year. CENTRAL RANGE. 11. Assistant Director Babu Nilmoni Chattarji held charge of the range throughout the year. He was on tour for 126 days and travelled 2,335 miles by road in addition to railway journeys. 12. During the year he inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries in the range and also the offices of the five circle inspectors. Besides, he attended 28 outbreaks of cattle- diseases, mostly of rinderpest, and visited 492 villages either for verification of the work of the touring veterinary assistant surgeons or for making enquiries into the prevalence of unreport- ed epidemics. In addition, he gave lectures to the cadets of the Hazaribagh Police Training School on common contagious diseases of cattle and their general management, inspected the jail cattle at Gaya, Buxar, Bhagalpur, the Jail and Reformatory cattle at Hazaribagh and the slaughter-houses under the Patna City, Sahibganj and Hazaribagh municipalities. 13. He also visited the Monghyr dairy farm and the agricultural farm at Sabour ; attended the meetings of the Patna Divisional Development Board at Arrah and Arwal; inspected Mounted Military Police horses at Arrah ; and acted as member and Secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board held in April and October 1930. ORISSA RANGE. 14. Rai Sahib P. N. Das held charge of the range. During the year he inspected almost all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, checked the work of the subordinate staff at headquarters and in the mufassal; attended an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicæmia at the Cuttack Jail and another of parasitic diarrhoea amongst the calves at the Namkum Vaccine Depot, Ranchi. 15. In addition, the officer attended some meetings of the district boards and the Divisional Development Board and inspected the Goshalas and Pinjrapoles at different places and the agricultural farm cattle at Khurda, Kanke, Cuttaok and Kujang. He was on tour for 142 days and travelled 2,182 miles by road in addition to railway journeys. 16. The electric installation and the arrangement for water- supply in the office building and laboratory were completed and the record room was fitted up with iron racks.
4 CHAPTER II. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 17. With the starting of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College at Patna all the Bihar and Orissa veterinary students discontinued their studies at the Bengal Veterinary College. The first annual report of the Principal, Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, will be found printed with this report. 18. Professional examinations for subordinate officers.5 satisfactory as all the principal diseases were prevalent in a mild form, while anthrax and black quarter were not reported in some districts. 22. Altogether 6,318 outbreaks were brought to notice in which out of 113,382 animals affected, 33,719 died, as compared with 6,660 outbreaks, 111,080 attacks and 35,543 deaths reported in the year 1929-30. There has been a decrease of a little over eighteen hundred in the number of deaths. Out of the total number, 5,508 outbreaks were attended by the staff. The total number of animals shown as affected includes 42,500 cases of foot and mouth disease. 23. According to the area and cattle population of each range, the figures for contagious diseases are distributed as follows :6 29. Strangles.7 34. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.8 to 79,641 head of cattle compared with 324,032 in 1929-30 and 328,153 in 1928-29. Though there was a great demand for inoculations from the raiyats, sera and vaccines could not be spent as freely as before due to the fact that the expenditure for same had to bo controlled generally according to the budget provisions of the district boards. Many district boards had heavy outstanding charges to meet on account of sera and vaccines spent during the previous two years, and as it was impossible for them to incur fresh charges except to a limited extent, inoculation was undertaken, in those cases only as the last resource, i.e., when all the ordinary measures had failed to check the disease. The work is distributed according: to ranges as follows :9 44. An outbreak of this disease occurred among the Purnea Jail cattle which caused 5 deaths before the disease could be diagnosed. No more deaths among these animals were reported after inoculation. With a view to protecting the other jail animals from this disease, arrangements were made with the Prisons Department to have all jail cattle vaccinated before rains in the year 1931-32. There were 6 deaths among the inoculated animals throughout the province, the death rate being about .28 per cent. 45. Anthrax.10 NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 49. Opening of new dispensaries.11 also to the growing popularity of the dispensaries. The increase in the total number of castrations by 3,320 is satisfactory. 53. Of the total number of cases treated including castra- tions, 66,129 were treated in the North Bihar Range, 98,096 in the Central Range and 40,639 in the Orissa Range as compared with 53,990, 83,871 and 39,676 cases respectively in the three ranges in 1929-30. 54. The touring staff could visit 62,364 villages as against 63,788 in 1929-30. The decrease of 1,424 in the number of villages visited is due to more attention being paid by the staff to castration work, especially in the North Bihar Range and to the abolition of three posts of touring veterinary assistant surgeons in the Orissa Range in the previous year. 55. Out of the total number, 23,956 villages were visited in North Bihar, 28,566 in Central and 9,842 in the Orissa Range as compared with 25,085, 27,406 and 11,297 respectively in the year 1929-30. The details of the work done in each district are shown in Table IV. HOSPITALS. 56. Number of hospitals.12 59. In addition, 6,836 cases not brought to the hospitals were supplied with medicines and 11,549 castrations were performed by the assistants in charge, against 10,849 cases and 7,553 castra- tions respectively in the three ranges in 1929-30. The details of the work done in each hospital are shown in Table V. CHAPTER IV. BREEDING OPERATIONS. 60. Control of livestock improvement.13 sardar and 3 sardars, 1 fireman, 1 forgeman, 4 chaukidars, 2 office peons, and the menials paid from contingencies. No change Occurred during the year. 65. Livestock.14 balance Rs. 340-2 0 could not be realised during the year duo to the sudden fall in market rates of grain in consequence of which the tenants had to suffer a great deal. They have, however, promised to pay up the balance as early as possible. 69. Crops such as maize, juar, bajra, oats and gram were grown on the farm. The total outturn of monsoon and rabi crops was 36,721 maunds including green fodder and bhusa to the value of Rs. 14,511-4-0. The expenditure on cultivation during the year was Rs. 11,542-13-0. 70. Irrigation.15 to increase the milk strain, and distribution of pure bred bulla in selected areas. This question is now under consideration. 76. Six hundred cattle were protected against black quarter by inoculation which was carried out with the assistance of some of the staff and students of the Veterinary College, and the result was satisfactory. The health of the cattle, except for the foot and mouth disease was, on the whole, good. HORSE BREEDING. 77. Nil. FAIRS AND SHOWS. 78. As usual, the important horse and cattle fairs and shows in the province were attended by the staff. A striking feature of the year was the organization of a livestock exhibition and show at the Sonepur Eair in which the local officers took keen interest. A special staff was deputed by the department to give every possible help. The proposed exhibition was ultimately abandoned owing to the opposition of interested parties, but a modified cattle show was held, and the work done by the depart- mental staff was greatly appreciated. There was an outbreak of rinderpest at this fair which was speedily checked by the veteri- nary officers on duty. Help was given by the department in the purchase of an elephant and a pony for the Bahadurpur Court of Wards Estate, and of 2 pairs of bullocks for the Conservator of Forests. The Officiating Director, Mr. Garewal, paid a visit to the Sonepur Fair, while Special Officer,'Mr. Malik, visited Sonepur, Sitamarhi and Khagra, and acted as one of the judges at the shows held in each of these fairs. 79. 1,902 animals were booked to different places from the Sonepur district of the Bengal and North-Western Railway. 80. The particulars of animals and their prices, etc., are shown in Tables XIII and XIV. Except in the case of buffaloes there has been a marked decrease in the number of horses and cattle at these fairs. CHAPTER V. PROVINCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. 81. There was no change in the personnel of the cadre of Provincial Service Officers. Mr. S. K. Sen, B. SC., M.R.C.V.S., was appointed special officer under training for one year or until further orders with effect from 28th November 1930. The superior teaching staff of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College was completed with the recruitment
16 on contract for five years of Mr. P. G. Malkani, B.V.SC., M.R.C.V.S., as Research Officer and Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology. 82. The scheme for the introduction of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Service, Class I, was further considered by Govern- ment during the year. CHAPTER VI. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. 83. There was no change in the number of veterinary inspectors which remained 13 as in the previous year. 84. Another senior veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu M. S. Mohan Raj, was appointed Cruelty Inspector under the Bihar and Orissa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for one year from 9th October 1930 for North Bihar areas, there being now 3 officers of this class including the one transferred to foreign service under the Patna City Municipality. The staff of three veterinary inspectors being insufficient for the Orissa Range, one of the C posts of inspectors of the Central Range was transferred to that range and a new circle with Sambalpur as headquarters was opened during the year. Inspector, Babu M. M. Banarji, who was attached to the Patna Cattle Farm returned to his own circle, Hazaribagh. 85. On 1st April 1930, the district cadre consisted of 126 veterinary assistant surgeons including the assistant surgeon employed under the Bettiah Raj. During the year, 9 new graduates were absorbed, and one assistant (hitherto employed as Khedda officer) reverted, making the total number 136. Out of these, 2 were promoted to the staff, 4 were transferred to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, 1 retired, 1 resigned and 1 died ; so that, at the end of the year, there were 127 veterinary assistant surgeons actually employed in districts, i.e., 30 stationary and 97 touring. 86. The number of posts of each range was as follows :17 CHAPTER VII. LABORATORIES. 87. The laboratory and the serum depot attached to the Cen- tral Range office together with the laboratory assistants and attendant were transferred to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, Patna, with effect from the 13th June 1930. Since then materials for bacteriological and other examinations from the Central Range are being sent to the College instead of to the Range office. 88. Altogether 7,603 specimens including blood smears, pus, fæces, urine, skin scrapings, etc., were received and examined in the range and college laboratories during the year as compared with 6,163 in the year 1929-30. In addition, 149 pathological specimens of tumours, internal and external parasites and other materials were also examined for purposes of preservation in the college museum. 89. Out of 7,603 specimens examined, 906 cases were diagnosed. Details of the work according to ranges are shown below :18 INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES. NORTH BIHAR RANGE. 90. Equine Filariasis.19 99. Fowl Cholera.20 107. Otorrh21 of the previous year, 231 convictions were secured, and a sum of Rs. 1,846 was realized as fines and credited to the municipality. 115. A proposal for the appointment of a third Cruelty Inspector for the municipalities in the Orissa division with Cuttack as headquarters is under the consideration of Government 116. The question of empowering the inspectors to prosecute under the Act without police help is receiving the attention of the Society. 117. During the year, I organized the 1st Bihar and Orissa 8. P. C. A. Horse and Cattle Show which was held on the Banki- pur maidan in the presence of a distinguished gathering. There were many entries in each class, and some fine type of animals were exhibited. Khan Bahadur M. Hamid, Additional District Magistrate in charge, Patna City Municipality, gave me every assistance to make the show a success. 118. Altogether 1,438 cases of cruelty were seized or sent up in the Province, out of which 967 ended in convictions as com- pared with 1,329 and 1,227 respectively in the year 1929-30. CHAPTER X. ROYAL COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE. 119. The need of an increase in the subordinate staff is being keenly felt but considering the present financial position, there appears to be little chance of employing any extra men in the near future. As the College has now started, the question of creating new posts in the subordinate district cadre should receive serious attention. As regards research work, the Imperial Council of Agri- cultural Research has taken up the question in earnest, and it is expected that something very substantial will be done in this respect in the Province within the next few years.

23 Annual Report of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College for the year 1930-31. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Charge.24 5. Owing to the late appointment of the Professor of Patho- logy and Bacteriology, the teaching of Pathology and Bacteriology had also to be temporarily allotted to Babu P. Panda, the 1st Laboratory Assistant, whose services were transferred to the college on the abolition of the Head Office Laboratory. He taught these subjects quite satisfactorily in addition to his own duties from 1st July until Mr. Malkani joined. 6. Subordinate staff.25 62 students on the roll. Out of this number 11 new and 27 old students were either natives of the Province or domiciled in it, 6 were sent on stipend by the United Provinces Government, 6 by the Hyderabad State, 1 by Keonjhar State and 1 joined as a private student from the Central Provinces. According to communities, 30 were Hindus, 18 Muhammadans and 4 Indian Christians. Among these students there were 6 undergraduates, 44 matriculates and *2 non-matriculates. 10. Two students left the college after the X'Mas holidays while one died in February, 1931. Thus, a total of 49 students remained on the roll at the end of the session. 11. Examination.26 13. Hostel.27 October last. It is necessary to have this room fitted up with water and gas connections and steps have been taken for same. Most of the necessary appliances were purchased during the year. Milk test is daily carried out in this Laboratory. Samples of milk from the cows of the Government Cattle Farm are collected in such a way that milk of each cow is tested once a week and a permanent record is being kept of same. Practical instruc- tions in milk inspection were given to the students in this Laboratory and at the Patna Dairy. 22. The Cantonment, Military and Municipal slaughter bouses at Dinapur were utilised for the purpose of giving demonstration to the students on meat inspection and my thanks are due to the Municipal, Military and Cantonment authorities for allowing the use of the slaughter houses.

READ2 and first and second year annual examinations conducted by a Board of Examiners, specially appointed by Govern- ment with Mr. A. D. MacGregor, F.R.C.V.S., F.Z.S., I.V.S., Principal of the Bengal Veterinary College, as President, were eminently satisfactory and Government trust that the college will soon establish a high reputation for itself and turn out really capable and qualified men by insisting on a high standard of examination and teaching. 3. The total number of outbreaks of contagious diseases reported during the year was 6,318 against 6,660 in the previous year. The number of animals affected slightly increased from 111,080 to 113,382, but the number of deaths recorded a welcome decrease from 35,543 to 33,719. This decrease was all the more remarkable in view of the fact, that, owing to financial stringency and the unsatisfactory condition of the finances of local bodies throughout the province, the money available for preventive inoculation was considerably curtailed and the department was only able to undertake inoculation in 79,641 cases against 324,032 cases in 1929-30 and 328,153 in 1928-29. Epidemics were tackled in the ordinary way by the use of disinfectants and treatment, and the isolation of affected animals, inoculation being undertaken only when these cheaper measures failed to check the disease. In spite of this Government had to spend during the year a total of Rs. 53,353-14-10 on sera and vaccine against an average expenditure of below Rs. 10,000 a few years ago. Debts outstanding from local bodies have, however, now been almost cleared up and the position might be said to have become normal. Government trust that the experience of this year's working will be borne in mind in future so that epidemics may continue to be treated in the first instance by ordinary measure until, at any rate, the financial condition so improves that more expenditure on sera and vaccine becomes practicable. 4. As compensation for the smaller number of preventive inoculations undertaken in the mufassil, touring veterinary assistant surgeons were able to pay more attention to ordinary cases of disease with the result that 204,861 cases were treated this year against 177,537 cases in the previous year. The number of patients treated at the hospitals also increased from 63,286 to 70,067. These results are satisfactory and indicate the growing popularity of the department as well as the gradual awakening of public conscience to the sufferings of dumb animals.
3 5. The Patna cattle breeding and dairy farm registered a successful year's working under the management of Babu N. N. Ghosh. The average yield of milk per cow per day increased from 6.2 lbs. in the previous year to 7.3 lbs. The revenue increased from Rs. 27,064 in 1929-30 to Rs. 51,521 in 1930-31, which was all the more remarkable, being coupled with a decrease in expenditure from Rs. 54,607 to Rs. 52,748. The only other work in connection with live-stock improvement entrusted to the department is the castration of scrub bulls. Due attention appears to have been paid to this work during the year under report. 6. Government are pleased to note that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals showed a record of another year's successful work. The horse and cattle show at Patna organised by Major Riley under the auspices of the Society was the first one of its kind andappears to have been eminently successful. 7. In conclusion, Government in the Ministry of Education are pleased to record their appreciation of the zeal and efficiency with which the department was administered during the year under review by Major Riley and Mr. Garewal. They are also pleased to note the names of officers who have been commended for good work by Major Riley. They trust that all the officers of the depart- ment will work with redoubled energy so as to utilise the resources at their disposal to the utmost and that they will not allow themselves to be discouraged by the rigid econo- mies which have become necessary on account of the retrenchments effected in their contingent grants.

[Maximum limit 30 pages.] ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1931-32. CHAPTER I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. I HELD charge of the department throughout the year. Assistant Director Babu Nilmoni Chattarji continued to be in charge of this range under my direct supervision and guidance in important matters. 2. I was promoted to the selection grade with effect from the 21st March 1931, while the designation of the head of the department was changed from Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government to that of Director of Veterinary Services from the 15th October 1931. 3. During the year, I visited all the districts of the province except Angul. The latter district was also programmed for, but it could not be reached owing to a sudden attack of fever. While on tour, I visited many important stations in the interior, saw the conditions which prevailed in those places, and inspected 63 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries located not only at district and subdivisional headquarters, hut also in mufassal towns. I also inspected the office of the Assistant Director in charge of Orissa Range at Cuttack. 4. In addition to the above, I inspected the breeding herd of the Patna Cattle Farm and visited the buffalo breeding farm at Sipaya. 5. I attended both meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla and Delhi. While at Simla, I took part in the deliberation at a conference of veterinary officers which decided upon the programme of work to be followed by the Provincial Disease
2 Investigation Officers and discussed informally with Col. A. Olver, C.B., C.M.G., F.R.C.V.S., the Animal Husbandry Expert, the scheme for the appointment of a Disease Investigation Officer proposed for this province. 6. In the month of December, under instructions from Government, I examined a number of horses at the Remount Depôt, Calcutta, out of which 36 were passed and taken over by the Mounted Military Police. A question having arisen for transferring this Force from Arrah to Patna and locating it in the temporary jail buildings at the Patna Farm, the Inspector- General of Police, the Superintending Engineer of Public Health, the Superintending Engineer, South Bihar Circle and myself, inspected the site and buildings. This question was, however, dropped due to a change in the political outlook. I examined the horses of the Escort of His Excellency the Governor, preliminary to its disbandment and gave my opinion regarding their disposal. 7. As in the previous year, I acted as a member of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College ; as an external examiner at the annual examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College at Belga- chia and as President and senior examiner of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board at the half-yearly professional examinations for the subordinate staff in April and October. 8. The second S. P. C. A. show was organised by me. I also attended the Sonepur Fair and the annual Camp of Exercise of the Bihar Light Horse at Muzaffarpur. 9. Altogether I spent 126 days on tour and travelled 2,644 miles by road, in addition to the usual rail journeys. 10. At headquarters, besides the ordinary office routine, I submitted a special scheme for the appointment of a Disease Investigation Officer and some proposals relating to the adminis- tration of the college, such as the proposal for redistribution of subjects, accommodation of students, grant of leave to students, abolition of the aggregate system of examinations, selection of students by the governing body, starting of a post-graduate class at the college, etc. I also submitted proposals for the considera- tion of the Orissa Boundary Committee and for the committee appointed to advise Government on retrenchment, I appeared before the latter committee and gave evidence. 11. Special Officer, Mr. S. K. Sen, M.R.C.V.S., on comple- tion of his training at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, was again attached to the head office and permitted to do office work connected with the Central Range.
3 12. During the year, he inspected 8 veterinary hospitals and 41 veterinary dispensaries, the Government cattle at the Sabour Farm, the jail cattle at Gaya, Buxar, Bhagalpur and Hazaribagh, the Government ponies at the Police Training School, Hazari- bagh, the Mounted Military Police horses at Arrah and also the conservancy buffal4 training at the Bhagalpur veterinary hospital and acted as a member and Secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Exa- mination Board in April and October. He was on tour for 138 days and travelled 6,230 miles by road, in addition to the rail journeys. 16. The work of this range has considerably developed in consequence of the extensive tours of the Range Officer and the Special Officer, Mr. Sen, and also because the Director was able to visit a larger number of institutions during the year. ORISSA RANGE. 17. Assistant Director Rai Sahib P. N. Das was in charge of the range. He inspected practically all the veterinary hos- pitals and dispensaries, and while on tour, checked the mufassal work of the veterinary assistant surgeons. He inspected the offices of the veterinary inspectors, the pinjrapoles at Jatni, Sambalpur, Sohella and Bargarh, visited the vaccine depot at Namkum, and saw the livestock of the agricultural farms at Cuttack, Khurda and Kanke, the Angul khedda elephants and the horses of the Ravenshaw Girls' School, Cuttack. The Pashu- mangal mela or the Show for the welfare of animals at Cuttack was organized by him jointly with the Secretary to the local S. P. C. A. He also attended the fairs and exhibitions at Chau- liaganj, Banki and Ravenshaw college. He was on tour for 163 days and travelled 2,903 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys. CHAPTER II. VET BINARY INSTRUCTION. BIHAR AND ORISSA VETERINARY COLLEGE. 18. The college completed its second session during the year. Mr. R. T. Davis, I.V.S., held charge of the Principalship throughout the year except for one month from 16th December 1931 to 15th January 1932 when he proceeded on leave and the Professor of Pathology and Research Officer, Mr. P. G. Malkani, B.V.SC., M.R.C.V.S., remained in charge of the Principal's office in addition to his own duties. 19. Mr. Davis, in addition to his duties as Principal and Professor of Medicine, also acted as Secretary of the Governing Body for the college, as a member of the Board of Examiners for the session and as an external examiner at the annual examina- tions of the Bengal Veterinary college at Belgachia. As con- trolling officer of the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, he supervised the work of the Manager and the staff.
5 20. There was no change among the superior teaching staff except that Professor Malkani was granted one month's leave in continuation of the summer vacation, but as regards the subordinate staff, due to financial reasons, the three assistants to the professors of Anatomy, Surgery and Hygiene had to revert to the department and their posts in the college cadre remained vacant from 1st March 1932. The details of the staff are shown in Table VII of the college. 21. Students.6 was just enough for the present number and the question of increasing it in view of more students coming from other provinces and States is receiving attention. 26. The general health of the students in the hostel was satis- factory during the year. Professor G. N. Roy Chowdhury relinquished the charge of wardenship to Mr. S. I. H. Akbari, Lecturer in Materia Medica, from the 5th July 1931. The latter officer was appointed warden for the new session for 1931-32. 27. Library and Museum, Athletic and Debating society.7 year and taken over by the college. All the students received training in equitation. Two new animals were added to the strength of the riding ponies. 33. Research laboratory.8 acted as President and senior examiner and Babu Nilmoni Chattarji as second examiner on the first examination board. The second board was constituted by three members, viz., myself as Presi- dent and senior examiner, and Mr. Malik and Babu Nilmoni Chattarji as examiners. In addition to his duties as an examiner, the latter officer also acted as Secretary to both the boards. 32 veterinary assistant surgeons including those who failed before, appeared, and 24 passed. The effect of these examina- tions in keeping the professional knowledge of the subordinate staff up to date has so far been salutary. 40. Post-graduate training.9 CHAPTER III. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. 44. During the year, a strict watch was kept over the progress of contagious diseases and the statistics which were subjected to greater scrutiny show that since the severe epidemics of i928-29 and 1929-30 at which very extensive preventive measures were undertaken, the virulence of the diseases has been steadily on the decline. The four principal diseases, rinderpest, hæmorrhagic septicæmia, black quarter and anthrax were prevalent, but their attacks were generally less severe, and as regards black quarter and anthrax, the diseases were almost sporadic with certain exceptions. The latter disease was not reported in North Bihar Range except in Darbhanga, while Purnea, and Supaul and Madhipura subdivisions of Bhagalpur district are said to have been free from black quarter. This disease was also not reported in five districts out of the eight of each of the Central and Orissa Ranges. Like black quarter, anthrax was also not reported in two districts of the Central and six of the Orissa Range. It was however towards the suppression of rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia that most of the energy was directed. These two diseases, though the outbreaks were not very widespread, affected all the districts. Rinderpest was particularly severe in Cuttack where it carried off more than two thousand animals. It was least perceptible in Muzaffarpur and Angul. Foot and mouth disease was less prevalent in the two ranges, North Bihar and Central, but was not so in the Orissa Range where a large number of animals were affected though the death-rate was low. No death from this disease was reported in the North Bihar Range. 45. The map attached to the report shows the general dis- tribution of the principal contagious diseases in the province. 46. Altogether 4,728 outbreaks were reported during the year against 6,318 in 1930-31. In these outbreaks, out of a total number of 80,067 animals affected, 21,684 died, as compared with 113,382 attacks and 33,719 deaths during the previous year, which shows a decrease of 33,315 and 12,035 respectively in the total number of attacks and deaths. Excluding 34,531 cases of foot and mouth diseases, the number of animals which suffered from the more deadly forms of diseases, came to be about 45,50010 47. The figures for the outbreaks of contagious diseases, deaths, etc., according to the area and cattle population of each range are shown below:11 more liberally from the Chaukidari Reward Fund. The matter is being placed in the hands of the Inspector-General of Police. 50. During the year, 123 chaukidars were either punished or recommended for punishment, for failing to report outbreaks, while 9 were rewarded or recommended for reward for giving help to the staff. 51. The old Police Manual form no. 11 being found defec- tive, the Inspector-General of Police has kindly undertaken its revision in order to make it agree to its counterpart, the human epidemic report form. With the modifications suggested, the new form, it is hoped, will give better results. EQUINE. 52. Glanders and Farcy.12 Shahabad and Cuttack, each recording over 2,000 deaths. In Hazaribagh more than 1,900 deaths were recorded. It is however worth noticing that only one death was reported in Muzaffarpur. The total number of deaths reported in each range was 734 in North Bihar, 10,207 in Central and 5,112 in Orissa. 60. In all, 2,428 outbreaks were brought to notice and out of a total number of 38,432 animals affected, 16,053 died, as compared with 3,493 outbreaks, 64,575 attacks and 28,541 deaths reported in the year 1930-31. 2,350 outbreaks were attended by the staff. 61. Foot and mouth disease.13 consisted of 32 from ephemeral fever, 101 from bovine surra, 1 from bovine piroplasmosis and 3 from bovine rabies. OTHERS. 66. Altogether 549 deaths were recorded, against 125 in 1930-31, and these were classified as follows :14 protected being 87,830 as against 58,369 done in 385 outbreaks in 1930-31. As usual, the district of Gaya headed the list with a record of 15,440 inoculations. Next to Gaya may be mentioned Bhagalpur with 10,479 inoculations, Hazaribagh with 9,291, and Santal Parganas, Champaran and Singhbhum each with over 7,000. The largest number, viz., 53,304 inoculations were carried out in the Central Range. 70. Serum simultaneous inoculation.15 the year 1930-31. The number includes 83 ponies which were inoculated against equine anthrax in two districts, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga. The disease did not actually, break out in Muzaffarpur but 7 in-contact ponies of the Manager, Darbhanga Raj, which were removed to the Bahwara factory in that district, were inoculated there. Only 4 of the inoculated animals died. 73. Black quarter.16 payment. The board ultimately withdrew their orders. The question of realizing fees for inoculation from persons who are capable of payment has also been raised by the district board, Muzaffarpur. It is now under the consideration of Government. NUMBER OF ANIMALS TREATED. 77. Opening of new dispensaries.17 days a month. They were nevertheless able to treat, both on tour and at headquarters, as many as 204,927 fresh cases which shows even a small increase of 63 cases, compared with the figures of the previous year. The number includes 69,262 castrations, as compared with 67,694 done in 1930-31. An inevitable result of the restrictions on touring was that the veterinary assistant surgeons could not visit more than 57,422 villages as against 62,364 visited by them, in 1930-31. The details of the work in respect of each district are shown in Table IV. 82.

19 necessary, previous sanction of Government should be obtained and that any surplus stock remaining should be sold at reasonable prices at melas and cattle fairs, or to private purchasers. There appears to be a general reluctance on the part of the public to take over any bull for breeding purposes and difficulty wa9 experienced in the disposal of 20 bulls matured on the farm. Though the district boards were furnished with particulars of the bulls early in December 1931, only two boards, Santal Parganas and Balasore, applied for 1 bull each up to the end of the financial year. About the end of March last, the Corporation of Calcutta applied for 10 bulls but before any action could be taken on the application, the question as to whether the bulla from the Patna farm could be sold to an outside province had to be considered. Government have since decided that these bulls can be sold to purchasers outside the province and arrangements are now being made to advertise the sales of the bulls on a wider scale. 87. Stud bulls.20 74 cross-bred heifer calves, 17 desi bull calves, 27 desi heifer cal- ves, 7 Tharparkar bulls, 50 draught bullocks and 1 pony, or a total of 545 animals. During the year, 41 Tharparkar calves and 89 cross-bred calves were born on the farm and 8 Tharparkar cows with 7 calves were purchased, raising the total to 690. Out of this number there were 18 casualties and 156 animals were sold leaving the total strength of the herd at 516 at the end of the year. The average number of cows in milk during the year was 87. 91. Milk and milk products.21 while the expenditure on cultivation during the year, was Rs. 8,838-2-0. 94. Irrigation.22 of fodder and water was sufficient and no cattle epidemic was reported. Promiment among the animals were elephants and to a less extent horses and ponies. The livestock consisted of different classes such as country cows, Hissar, Montgomary, Tayler breed, buffaloes, etc. The animals were brought from differ- ent districts and provinces by road, rail, steamers and country boats and purchasers also flocked from different provinces and such distant parts as Assam and Rajputana. Seven Government Khedda elephants were sent to the fair by the Deputy Commissioner, Angul, for disposal and were sold by the veterinary staff with the greatest difficulty. His Excellency the Governor of Bihar and Orissa visited Sonepur. I was present at the camp for four days and looked after the general arrangements. A considerable amount of useful work was done by the veterinary staff deputed to the fair. They gave every help in the care and management of the livestock, in the treatment of sick animals at the camp veterinary dispensary and in doing propaganda work for the department. At the 22 principal fairs and shows of which the particulars are shown in Tables XIII and XIV, over 244,000 animals were brought for sale. There was a decrease in the total number of animals as compared with the previous year's figures. 101. Though the figures are by no means complete, 5,912 animals were booked to different places from Sonepur by the Bengal and North-Western Bail way. There being a question of appointment of a Cattle] Traffic Officer under the Agriculture Department out of a grant from the Imperial Council of Agri- cultural Research, the Director of Agriculture, Bihar and Orissa, was furnished with a complete list of cattle fairs and shows, as well as the hats (cattle markets) held in the province. CHAPTER V. PROVINCIAL ESTABLISHMENT. 102. There Was no change in the cadre of the Provincial Veterinary Service officers, Rai Sahib P. N. Das and Babu Nilmoni Chattarji continuing to hold their respective charges as before. The former was due to retire on 15th May 1931 but was granted an extension of the service by one year more. State scholar, Mr. M. I. Malik, was in charge of the North Bihar Range, while Mr. S. K. Sen was still under training being attached to the head office. He was reappointed Special Officer for another year from 28th November 1931. As regards the staff of Professors at the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College there was also no change. 103. Due to the unsatisfactory financial position of Govern- ment the scheme for the new Superior Provincial Veterinary Service could not be revived during the year»
23 CHAPTER VI. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. 104. There was no change in the strength of the inspecting staff which consisted of 13 veterinary inspectors as in the year 1930-31. Veterinary inspector, Babu D. C. Guha, was transferred from the Central to the North Bihar Range to relieve inspector Babu A. K. Ghose appointed inspector in charge of the Patna Circle. For convenience of work, a few transfers from one range to another were also effected among the district cadre ; two temporary S. P. C. A. inspectors, Babu M. S. Mohan Raj and Maulavi A. U. Ahmad, and three assistants to Professors reverted to the department; one assistant, Babu H. L. Mandal, retired and two probationary assistants were discharged. 105.

(MINISTEY OF EDUCATION.) RESOLUTION The 28th September 1932. READ2 method only confers temporary immunity and a lasting solution of the problem of protection against epidemic diseases has to be found either by a more widespread use of the serum simul- taneous method or by utilizing locally prepared goat virus in connection with which some interesting experiments are now understood to be in progress. 4.The increase in the number of cases treated by touring veterinary assistant surgeons recorded last year was fully main- tained and the number of cases treated at headquarters hospitals registered a further increase from 70,067 to 75,153. The experi- ment made towards the close of the year of opening field veterinary dispensaries appears to be a move in the right direc- tion inasmuch as it brings the touring veterinary assistant surgeon in closer touch with the rural population and consider- ably enhances his scope of useful activity. 5.The Phulwari Dairy Farm continues its excellent work under the management of Babu N. N. Ghosh who has succeeded in increasing the average milk yield per cow per day from 6.2 lbs. in 1929-30 and 7.3 lbs. in 1930-31 to 8.7 lbs. in 1931-32. In spite of a 20 per cent decrease in the price of milk, the revenue from the farm only decreased by 10 per cent while the expenditure decreased fromRs. 54,607 in 1929-30 and Rs. 52,748 in 1930-31 to Rs. 48,645 in 1931-32. 6.Government have now accepted the policy of replacing the present mixed herd on the farm by pure bred Tharparkars, though the change will be gradually effected owing to financial stringency. They have also issued orders since the close of the year to distribute surplus breeding bulls free of cost to district boards and they hope that most of the boards will be able to maintain at least one bull at each headquarters veterinary hospital with a view to improve the supply of milk in urban areas. The Tharparkar is an excellent breed of milch cattle, though not so good as the Hansi-Hissar for draft purposes. The problem of improving livestock in the province will have to be tackled in the near future by making serious efforts in urban areas to improve the milk yield by crossing deshi cows with Tharparkar bulls. In rural areas the aim should be to produce sturdy draft animals by crossing deshi cows with Hansi-Hissar hulls stocked by the Agricultural Department on their cattle-breeding farms. 7.The Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College appears to have achieved very successful results in the second year of its working and the results of the examinations were eminently satisfactory.
3 The college hospital and the research laboratory seem to have done particularly useful work and the arrangements for post- graduate training which have been made since the close of the year should place the Veterinary College in the first rank of veterinary colleges in India. 8.The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has extended its operations and taken complete charge of its subordinates without any financial assistance from Government. Most of the municipalities have already accepted the suggestion to pay half the amount of fines recovered under the Act to the Society as contribution and it may be hoped that the Society will soon be placed on a sound footing to continue its work of awakening the public conscience to the sufferings of dumb animals. 9.In conclusion Government in the Ministry of Education are pleased to record their appreciation of the efficiency with which the department was administered by Major Riley and they are pleased to note the names of officers who have been specially commended for good work.

[Maximum limit 30 pages.] ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT BIHAR AND ORISSA FOR THE YEAR 1932-33. CHAPTER I. General Administration. I HELD charge of the department and exercised immediate supervision over the work of the Central Range throughout the year. 2. As Director of Veterinary Services of the province, I also held administrative charge of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College which included the control of the Government Cattle Farm, Patna. The work of the department increased during the year owing to the appointment of the Veterinary- Disease Investigation Officer. 3. I was confirmed in my present post with effect from the 24th November 1932. 4. During the year, I visited 12 districts and inspected 43 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. Unlike the previous year, I concentrated my visits on particular institutions which required greater attention than the others; and managed to inspect such outlying dispensaries as Gumla, Simdega, Bagaha, Kissenganj, Islampur, Sehra, etc. In addition, I visited some such important centres as Phulwari, Bikram, Tatanagar, Topcehanchi, etc., either in connection with the field veterinary dispensaries or to give professional advice. While on inspection duty at Cattack, I paid a visit to the Range office. At the 1 8 DVS
2 North Bihar Range Laboratory, Muzaffarpur, I saw the experi- mental animals which were undergoing the new method of goat virus inoculations against rinderpest. 5. At the request of the Police Department, I examined the horses of the Mounted Military Police at Arrah for easting. 6. As a member of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, I attended both the meetings of the Board held at Simla and New Delhi. A very important meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agri- culture and Animal Husbandry was organized during the year at Delhi following closely upon the sitting of the Advisory Board. I attended that meeting also being nominated as a representative of the Government of Bihar and Orissa. While there, I joined in the deliberation of a committee of experts under the Board which considered the question of an All-India curriculum for the Indian Veterinary Colleges. I also acted as a member of the Bihar and Orissa Agricultural Research Committee and of the re-constituted Provincial Agricultural Association. As usual, I attended the annual Camp of Exercise of the Bihar Light Horse at Muzaffarpur, and also Sonepur fair. 7. In March last, I acted as a member of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. Being appointed a member of the Board of Examiners of the Bengal Veterinary College, I acted as an external examiner at the annual examinations of that college; and also as President and the Senior Member of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for the half-yearly professional examinations of the subordinate staff held in April and October 1932. The stipendiary students of the province seeking admission to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College were also interviewed by me. 8. In addition to the above and the ordinary office routine at headquarters, I paid one official visit to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, some informal visits to the college hospital and the local veterinary hospital at Bankipur and also visited the Patna Cattle Breeding Farm frequently. 9. During the year, I travelled 2,609 miles by road in addi- tion to the journeys performed by rail and spent 132 days on tour. 10. Special Officer, Mr. S. K. Sen, m.k,c,v,s., remained attached to the office of the Director up to the 7th May 1932 after which he relieved Assistant Director, Babu Nilmoni Chattarji as Special Officer in charge of the Central Range. The latter officer proceeded to Cuttack being appointed to hold charge of the Orissa Range vice Assistant Director Rai Sahib P. N. Das, who retired from the 15th May 1932,
3 11. During the short period of one month, and seven days, Mr. Sen, as an officer under training, inspected two veterinary- dispensaries, Nawada and Warisaliganj, visited 8 police-stations and 10 villages. He also acted as an examiner at the half-yearly professional examination of subordinate veterinary officers. He spent 7 days on tour and travelled 272 miles by road. North Bihar Range. 12. Special Officer, Mr. M. I. Malik, m.r.c.v s., held charge of the North Bihar Range throughout the year. During the period, he spent 150 days on tour, travelled 3,646 miles by road in addition to railway journeys, inspected 30 permanent veterinary hospitals and dispensaries out of 43, and 28 field veterinary dispensaries out of 68 opened in the range. He also inspected the offices of 3 veterinary inspectors out of 4 in the range, visited the Government Cattle Farms, Pusa and Sipaya, as well as the important horse and cattle fairs and shows ; he acted as an examiner at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College and also at the half-yearly profes- sional examination of the subordinate veterinary officers held at Patna in October 1932. He, further, supervised the inoculation of the Darbhanga Raj horses against anthrax, attended an informal meeting of veterinary officers at Patna, the meetings of the Divisional Development Boards, Bhagalpur and Tirhut Divisions held at Kisbanganj and Sewan and a special meeting of the veterinary dispensary committee under the district board, Monghyr. Mr. Malik was also elected President of the Develop- ment Board meeting at Sewan and a member of the Council of Rural Economy formed at Muzaffarpur. Central Range. 13. Assistant Director, Babu Nilmoni Chattarji while in charge of the range from 1st April to 7th May 1932, acted as the Secretary and an examiner at the first half-yearly professional examination of the subordinate veterinary officers, and also as a member of the Selection Board for appointment of officers to the Provincial Veterinary Service. 14. Special Officer, Mr. S. K. Sen held charge of the Range from 8th May till the end of the year. During this period, he inspected 44 permanent veterinary hospitals and dispensaries out of a total of 51, the offices of 3 veterinary inspectors out of 5, and also visited 26 field veterinary dispensaries out of 49 opened in the range. While touring in the interior, he visited 81 police- stations and 220 villages where enquiries were made by him into the existence of cattle disease and work of the subordinate staff. 15. In addition to the above, Mr. Sen also inspected the Mounted Military Police horses at Arrah twice, the Agricul- tural Farm herd at Gaya, the Government cattle at Buxar and
4 Hazaribagh Central Jails, the animals of the Hazaribagh Reformatory School and of the Police Training College at Hazaribagh, and the Conservancy animals at Sahibgunge and Giridih. He also attended the Co-operative Federation Congress at Monghyr, the Goat Virus Vaccination Camp at Kanti (Muzaffar- pur) and Jahanabad (Gaya), Sonepur Fair, the Bihar and Orissa S. P. C. A. Cattle Show at Patna, a special meeting of the veteri- nary committee under the district board at Monghyr and also the Provincial Industrial Exhibition at Patna where he supervised the propaganda work of the department. He also acted as a member and Secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board held in April and October 1932, as a judge at the Cattle Show in Barahpur Fair which was organized by Mr. Jag- mohan, i.c.s., the Subdivisional Officer of Buxar, and delivered lectures to the cadets of the Hazaribagh Police Training College on common contagious diseases and general management of cattle. Orissa Range. 16. During the short period of incumbency of 1 month and 14 days, Rai Sahib P. N. Das inspected 7 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, acted as an examiner at the annual examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College and attended the meeting of gazetted officers held at Patna in April 1932. He spent 19 days on tour and travelled 611 miles by road. 17. Assistant Director, Babu Nilmoni Chattarji since taking over charge of the range on 15th May 1932, inspected 19 permanent veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, besides visiting 18 field veterinary dispensaries out of a total number of 36 opened during the year, checked the work of the subordinate staff in 280 villages, supervised the immunization of dairy cattle of the Tata Iron and Steel Company, Limited, at Jamshed- pur against rinderpest by the " Serum Simultaneous " method and tested the efficacy of Goat virus vaccination on some animals at the same place and at the Cuttack laboratory, inspected the conservancy cattle of Puri municipality and the Jail cattle at Puri, enquired into the general condition of the Government elephants at Purnagarh in Angul and the Agricultural Farm cattle at Cuttack. In addition Babu Nilmoni Chattarji also personally attended an outbreak of equine surra at Padampur (district Sambalpur) and an Exhibition of the Ravenshaw College and a cattle show at Cuttack, In the course of his tour, he further visited the meat markets, the cattle pounds and the dairy farm under the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee. He was on tour for 100 days and travelled 3,199 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys. Veterinary Disease Investigation Officer. 18. In pursuance of the general scheme for the appoint- ment of Veterinary Disease Investigation Officers, the Imperial
5 Council of Agricultural Research was pleased to allot a sum of Rs. 50,000 to Bihar and Orissa extending over a period of five years for investigation of obscure diseases in the province. It is satisfactory to note that the earliest possible opportunity was taken of the grant by appointing a highly-qualified officer, viz. Mr. Lakshmi Sahai, M.SC, M.R.C.V.S., to the post with effect from the 2nd May 1932. The officer has been placed under the direct control of the Director of Veterinary Services and provided with a separate office establishment and accom- modation in a part of the Director's office at the Secretariat. 19. According to the terms of the scheme, Mr. Sahai joined the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research at Muktesar for a course of training in different sections of the institute for six months. He returned from Muktesar on the 1st of November 1932 and shortly after, started investigations into two most important diseases of the programme, viz. Johne's Disease and Tuberculosis with special reference to their incidence in different parts of the province. With this object in view, he visited the Government Cattle Farm, Kanke once, and Sipaya twice during the year, and carried out the double-intradermal tuberculin test of both the herds and recommended certain control measures. While at headquarters, besides doing office work, he worked at the Veterinary College Laboratory on materials collected from different places. He was on tour for 57 days. CHAPTER II. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. 20. The Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College entered upon its 3rd session on the 1st July 1932. There was no change in the superior personnel, Mr. R. T. Davis, I.V.S, continuing to hold charge of the college as Principal. He also supervised the work of the Manager, Government Cattle Farm, Patna, and the staff. 21. In addition to his ordinary duties, Mr. Davis also acted as Secretary to the Governing Body of the College, a member of the Board of Examiners for the session 1932-33, an external examiner at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta, and as a member of the Bihar and Orissa Agricultural Research Committee. 22. The term of three years' contract of Dr. A. C. Chaudhuri, Professor of Hygiene and Dietetics, having come to an end, his appointment was extended temporarily for a period of two years more from the 1st April 1933. There was no change in the subordinate professional staff except that the three posts of assistants to the Professors which were retrenched temporarily from 1st March 1932, remained vacant throughout the year. The details of the staff employed are shown in Table VII(A).
6 23. Students.7 of Rs. 50 being realized in five equal instalments from students of the first year class instead of in two instalments from the next session. This will, it is hoped, remove the pecuniary diffi- culties generally experienced by candidates. 26. Post-graduate course.8 31. Shoeing Forge.9 Professional Examination and Training. 38. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board.10 bodies to be always in readiness to meet an emergency of this character. 41. The attached map shows the general distribution of the principal contagious diseases in the province. 42. The total number of outbreaks reported during the year was 5,063 which, compared with the figures of the previous year, shows an increase of 335 outbreaks. In these outbreaks, out of a total of 89,198 animals affected, 20,896 died, as compared with 80,067 attacks and 21,684 deaths recorded in 1931-32. The total number of animals affected includes 46,661 cases of foot and mouth disease. The increase in the number of outbreaks and seizures does not necessarily indicate an unhealthier situation as these figures are dependent on reporting and attendance as well. During the year under review, greater facilities for enquiry were afforded to the touring veterinary assistant surgeons in conse- quence of the opening of field veterinary dispensaries with the result that they could attend as many as 4,818 outbreaks out of the total number of 5,063 reported, the percentage of attendance being more than 95 against 92 of the preceding year. 43. The statistics of contagious diseases according to the area and cattle population of each range are as shown below :11 reporting of cattle disease by the chaukidars. The matter being brought to the notice of the Inspector-General and also District Superintendents of Police, prompt action was taken by the authorities concerned. I am grateful to the Inspector-General for the help given in this respect and it is hoped that the position will now improve. It is satisfactory to note that reporting through sources other than the police has also improved to some extent. 46. Altogether 59 chaukidars were either rewarded or recommended for rewards from the Chaukidari Reward Fund for good work, and 117 were either punished or recommended for punishment for neglect of duty. 47. The old Police Manual form no. 11 for recording cattle epidemics at the thana was still under revision in the Police Department. Equine. 48. Glanders and Farcy.12 (b) Tetanus.13 the figures show an increased incidence of the disease compared with the previous year, none of the outbreaks were severe, nor did they call for special measures. All the 89 outbreaks were attended. 57. Anthrax.14 work of managing field veterinary dispensaries in their respective jurisdictions. It is also a pleasing feature to note that relief to the livestock owners could be given by the staff in 114 more outbreaks than in the previous year. The number of outbreaks in which inoculation is performed still forms a very minor part of the total number of outbreaks attended, and it is hoped that the staff will be in a position to extend this work profitably to a greater number in future provided, of course, that money is available in the district board budget. Out of the total number inoculated, only 295 animals succumbed to the attacks which shows a percentage of .11 death, compared with .27 of the year 1931-32. 61. Details of the work done in each district are shown in Table III. This table will also show that of the total number, 47,664 inoculations were done in the North Bihar Range, 85,108 in the Central Range and 31,604 in the Orissa Range. 62. Rinderpest.15 it carries away the largest number of cattle each year. Till some years back, the only known method of wide applicability to protect cattle against the scourge of rinderpest, was the " serum alone" which was followed persistently in every province but, in course of time, experience showed that in order to be effective, cattle must be inoculated with anti-rinderpest serum at the very start of an outbreak, that the doses of serum must be regulated according to virulence of the disease, type and body weight of the animal and that as its immunity does not last long, re-inoculation must be resorted to when the outbreak does not subside in due time. Subsequent research conducted at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, led to the introduction of the "Serum Simultaneous " method which, conferring as it does, longer immunity, was adopted in most of the provinces during the last decade and made some progress in the Madras Presidency and the Mysore State. Experience has again proved that though it was a great improvement on the " Serum alone " method, it was, on account of the elaborate process requiring time and expense which it involves, was suited only for adoption among the valuable farm cattle. For the protection of the mass cattle population in the country, a much simpler and less expensive course was needed and the latest development, the goat virus vaccination, is likely to fill this place. An experiment of this method was carried out under my orders for the first time in North Bihar at the Experimental Station attached to the range office where a batch of nine cattle of different ages was immunized under the personal supervision of Special Officer, Mr. M. I. Malik with goat virus which was manufactured locally, and the result was most satisfactory. Being encouraged at the success, Mr. Malik subsequently persuaded Mr. Bose, the proprietor of the Kanti dairy farm, Muzaffarpur, and Raja P. C. Lal Chowdry M.L.C. of Purnea, to make over some of their animals for the experiment. A herd of 41 animals of different breeds and ages belonging to Mr. Bose was thus vaccinated at Kanti with equally successful results. As this was the first experiment of its kind outside the range headquarters, Special Officer Mr. S. K. Sen, with two veterinary inspectors, Babus P. C. Bhattacharji and A. K. Ghose and a staff veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu D. D. Dey of the Central Range, was deputed to Kanti to study the method in detail. The camp was also visited by me. The Raja Sahib's herd comprising 40 animals was similarly vaccinated at Purnea. Thanks are due to Mr. Bose and Raja P. C. Lal Chowdry for placing their animals at the disposal of the department and also for giving considerable help to the officers deputed to the camps. To test the length of immunity conferred by the new method, a mixed lot of six cattle from the immunized batches at the Experimental Station and
16 the Kanti Dairy Farm was injected with 5.c. c. of Rinderpest Bull Virus obtained from the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research. The animals were then kept under observation at the Experimental Station, and none contracted the disease. It was thus observed that the above two batches of cattle were capable of resisting active virus of the disease even after 39 and 72 days from the dates of immunization. In all 90 animals (including 9 of the Experimental Station) were immunized in the North Bihar Range against rinderpest by goat virus alone method of which six were also tested by Rinderpest Bull Virus for immunity. Vaccination by this method was carried out experimentally at three more centres, viz., of 40 cattle in a village in Gaya district and 6 and 18 cattle respectively at the Cuttack Laboratory and at Jamshedpur. The last two batches were also tested with Rinderpest Bull Virus with excellent results. Mention has already been made under " Veterinary Instruction " of equally successful results obtained in vacci- nating 186 animals of different breeds at the Government Cattle Farm, Patna, by the same method. 65. From the results so far achieved, there is every reason to believe that the Goat Virus vaccination will prove a potent as well as the cheapest substitute for the present day " serum alone " and " serum simultaneous " methods so far as protection against rinderpest is concerned. Some preliminaries, such as testing the susceptibility of different types of animals in the district will have to be carried out before this opera- tion can be launched as a prophylactic Until this is done, it is proposed to push on with the vaccination on an experi- mental basis along with the other methods now in vogue. 66. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.17 In addition, 72 ponies were protected against equine anthrax in the outbreak of the Darbhauga Raj stable; one of the inoculated ponies died. 68. Black Quarter.18 local bodies, who are to foot the bills in this province. It is hoped that the local bodies will in future utilize this concession to the best advantage of the cultivators by extending protection to their cattle. The revised rates include the cost of packing cases, bottles, crown caps, etc., and in some instances, postage, which is also an additional concession granted. Number of animals treated. 73. Owing to the financial stringency which was rendered more acute during the year under report, none of the local bodies could apply for the creation of an additional post of touring veterinary assistant surgeon. It is, however, a matter of consolation that no further reduction in the staff was effected, the total number being 136 as it was at the end of the year 1931-32. It is to be regretted that although the touring veterinary assistant surgeons are doing excellent work in the interior, the district board, Alonghyr, further pressed for the abolition of two second posts, viz, those at Begusarai and Jamui, out of the limited number of 6 such assistants employed in the district. On a reference being made to the District Magistrate, this question has been postponed by the board pending further consideration. 74. Construction of dispensaries.19 the existing system is already noticed in that there is no moving about on the part of a touring veterinary assistant surgeon looking for a diseased animal but that his movements being already known to the villagers, they gather round his field dispensary with their sick animals for treatment. The change has therefore conferred the double advantage, viz., an advantage on the cultivator of securing the services of the veterinary assistant surgeon until his bullock is cured, and also an advantage on the assistant of seeing through the full course of treatment adopted by him for a village animal which he could rarely have done during his ordinary tours in the past. In spite of the shortage of staff and the restrictions on touring, as many as 138 field veterinary dispensaries were maintained at the end of the year, and of these, 55 were opened in the North Bihar, 49 in the Central and the remaining 34 in the Orissa Range, the number of cases treated at these dispensaries being 76,313 ; according to ranges, they were 23,719, 34,504 and 18,060, respec- tively. These cases are included in the figures shown in Table IV. 77. The opening of the field veterinary dispensaries has more than anything else shown to what enormous extent the usefulness of the Civil Veterinary Department can be carried for the benefit of the cultivators, the very class of people on whom depends the national wealth of the country, without any appre- ciable additional expenditure. Their work in this province has, within the span of one year, been so keenly appreciated that it now leaves no room to go back on the moving-about system which has so long been followed. The only course open now is to go ahead and develop the work by paying more regular visits to the existing centres, and if possible, by opening additional dispensaries at other important centres. At present, though the number is less than two per assistant, being single-handed it has become extremely difficult for him to keep to his programme of attendances, as he is often engaged in outbreaks in other parts and has also to manage the headquarters dispensaries. To meet these shortcomings, all that is necessary is to appoint an additional touring staff, say, 2 per district, even on less emoluments, who would act as relieving assistants in times of outbreaks, etc. Veterinary hospitals. 78. Number of hospitals.20 for a hospital, has taken its place. Dinapur still continues to be in charge of a touring veterinary assistant surgeon. 79. Construction and repair.21 making the total number 47. Out of these, 7 casualties occurred owing to death, transfer or return, leaving 40 as balance at the end of the year. Except 2 bulls which belonged to Government, all others were the property of local bodies. 84. Castration of scrub bulls.22 87. 186 animals were protected against rinderpest by Goat Virus inoculation which was carried out with the assistance of the Veterinary College staff. The animals of the farm were also protected against hæmorrhagie septicæmia and black quarter as usual. The health of the animals was good throughout the year. 88. Supply of breeding bulls.23 93. Revenue and Expenditure.24 Babu Nilmoni Chattarji relieved Rai Sahib P. N. Das at Assistant Director in charge of the Orissa Range on the afternoon of 14th May 1932. He received full powers of administration of a Deputy Director and was granted a special pay of Rs. 100 per mensem so long as he remained in charge of the range. In consequence of his transfer to Cuttack, Special Officer, Mr. S. K. Sen was placed in partial charge of the Central Range from the 8th May 1932 and vested with all the powers which Babu Nilmoni Chattarji exercised before. CHAPTER VI. Subordinate Establishment. 99. The strength of the inspecting staff consisted in 13 veterinary inspectors as in the year 1931-32, each being in charge of a circle, T'here was no important change in their personnel except that Babu J. L. Bose was granted two months' leave, while inspector Babu A. C. Rautra was deputed to the post-graduate training at the Bihar and Orissa Velerinary College for six months from 1st July 1932. During the absence of these officers their charges were held by the inspectors of the Chaibassa and Puri circles respectively in addition to their own duties. Among the veterinary assistant surgeons, 3 assistants, viz., Babus S. D. Narayan (staff), L. K. Acharya and Maulavi S. A. Quadir were also deputed to the post-graduate course. 100. It is regretted that the department lost the services of one senior veterinary assistant surgeon by the untimely death of Babu B. C. Lal, and of another promising Uriya assistant, Babu B. Panda of Sambalpur who died of rabies. Only one new veterinary graduate out of the lot on the waiting list could be absorbed in the department. At the end of the year, the strength of the subordinate staff consisted of 13 veterinary inspectors, 2 laboratory assistants, 6 staff and 12 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 126 veterinary assistant surgeons employed in the districts (viz., 31 stationary and 95 touring), the details of which are shown in Table VII. 101. According to each range, the staff was distributed as follows:25 CHAPTER VII. Laboratories. 102. Under the existing arrangement, all laboratory work for the Central Range is carried out at the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College Laboratory, whereas the other two ranges have got their own laboratories and staff to do this work. During the year, 8,058 smears including blood, fæces, pus, urine and other body juices were received and examined at the college and range laboratories with the result that diseases were diagnosed in 1,285 instances as follows :26 106. The disease, nasal granuloma, being widely prevalent; in this range, 12,915 animals affected with it were treated mostly in the districts of Arrah, Gaya and Patna. The treat- ment adopted was intravenous injection of an aquous solution of Pot. Ant. Tart, 3 to 6 injections being found necessary to effect a cure. 107. Orissa Range.27 Provincial Revenues, the expenditure incurred by Government for the department amounted to 78 per cent*. The total receipts of the department amounted to Rs. 1,24,043. CHAPTER IX. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 110. The term of the deputation to foreign service of Cruelty Inspector, Babu S. B. Sahai under the Patna City Municipality having come to an end, Government were pleased to sanction another extension of the term for three years from 1st April 1933 subject to the condition that the officer would revert to the department whenever required, on promotion or otherwise. This inspector prosecuted 499 cases of cruelty out of which conviction was secured in 455 cases (including some old cases) and fines to the extent of Rs. 2,613-12-0 were realised during the year. The amount of the fine was almost the same as in the previous year, and the inspector appears to have maintained his efficiency. 111. The Bihar and Orissa S. P. C. A.28 113. A very important change in the administration of the Cruelty to Animals Act took place during the year. Previously the inspectors appointed under the Act had no police power to seize an animal offended against. During the year, Government were pleased to authorize the Inspector-General of Police to grant a certificate to the Inspectors under which he can now seize such an animal without the help of the police. CHAPTER X. Royal Commission on Agriculture. 114. Practically speaking, no progress could be made by the department in giving effect to the Commission's recommendations except that the post-graduate training class at the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College was started, and that the Veterinary Disease Investigation Officer for facilitating research was appointed during the year. Want of funds is the only obstacle that stands in the way. CHAPTER XI. General Remarks. 115. Propaganda.29 117. Hackney carriage and ekka services.80 S. K. Chatterji, S. D. Singh, B. D. Gupta, M. Upadhaya, A. Lal, D. Prashad, Maulavi Muhammad Ishaque, Babus B. N. Das, G. B. Patnaik, S C. Dorai, G. S. Dehuri and M. Kbess. 121. The Principal of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College acknowledged the work of the laboratory under Mr. Malkani's direction and expressed his satisfaction at the results which, in his opinion, were encouraging. 122. The work at the Patna Cattle Breeding Farm maintained its high standard of efficiency as before under the managership of Babu N. N. Ghose. 123.

No. 1620-D. GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. (MINISTRY OF EDUCATION) RESOLUTION. Dated the 21th October 1933. READ2 judicious use of the chaukidari reward fund. As many as 59 chaukidars were either rewarded or recommended for reward during the year against 9 in the previous year. The decrease in the number of deaths was partly due to decreased virulence of rinderpest and partly to the better facilities for treatment afforded by the opening of 138 field veterinary dispensaries. Villagers have now the advantage of the services of the touring veterinary assistant surgeons at well-known centres and the further advant- age of getting their animals put through the full course of treatment without going to the headquarters hospital. Field veterinary dispensaries are still in an experimental stage, but the experiment is undoubtedly full of promise and should be continued. 3. The number of preventive inoculations increased from 134,269 in the previous year to 164,232. Most of the local bodies have now succeeded in clearing up arrears and are able to make normal provision for sera and vaccine in their budget. A further improvement in the position may confidently be expected from the welcome reduction of nearly 50 per cent in the cost of sera and vaccine sanctioned by the Government of India with effect from the 1st April 1933. Most of the inoculations were done by the "serum alone" method. Experiments, however, continued to be made on a small scale with the "serum simultaneous" method. The "goat virus alone'' method of vaccination for rinderpest was also further tested at various centres. The Director considers that there is every reason to believe that the latter method will prove a potent and cheap substitute for the serum methods so far as rinderpest is concerned. It is, however, rightly proposed to carry on with the old methods of inoculation until it is conclu- sively established that vaccination by goat virus is able to confer longer immunity at less expense. The number of veterinary hospitals remained stationary at 33, but the number of patients increased from 75,153 in 1931-32 to 83,273 thus testifying to their increased popularity. 4. The Patna cattle breeding and dairy farm registered another very successful year. The revenue increased from Rs. 45,875 in 1931-32 to Rs. 54,573, largely as a result of improved cultivation of the 331 acres of land attached to the farm. On the other hand, the total expenditure further decreased to Rs. 46,940 which may be compared with the total of Rs. 54,607 in the year 1929-30 before the present manager, Babu N. N. Ghosh, took over charge. The strength of the herd
3 remained practically constant, while the average yield of milk has been maintained at 8.7 lbs. per cow, which was the maximum yield reached last year. Government have issued orders for the distribution of surplus bulls from the farm to district boards free of charge and to others interested in live- stock improvement at a minimum concessional price of Rs. 50 per animal against an estimated cost of production of Rs. 300 for each animal. As many as 8 bulls were distributed free to district boards during the year under report. 5. The Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College continued to progress under the able guidance of its Principal, Mr. Davis. There was a slight decrease in admissions owing to the general economic depression and the paucity of vacancies for veterinary assistant surgeons. The examination results were eminently satisfactory. The veterinary hospital attached to the college increased in popularity, while the research laboratory appears to have yielded encouraging results. 6. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals has now got a staff of 5 whole-time inspectors and has extended its operations to 19 municipalities. The inspectors have also been authorized to seize animals without the assistance of the police. The financial position appears to have improved and orders have issued that fines realized under the Cruelty to Animals Act should, in future, be credited to the society in full. 7. Government are pleased to note that all departmental officers are taking increased interest in the very important work of propaganda which is being organised on definite lines. They are also pleased to note the names of officers who have been specially commended by the Director for good work. Their thanks are duo to Major Riley for his efficient administration of the depart- ment and to all chairmen of district boards and other non-officials on whose co-operation the activities of the department mainly depend.

The above buildings have since been repaired except the main college in which the repairs are in rapid progress and are expected to be completed before the commencement of the ensuing session. Professional Examination and Training. 56. The Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board.11 81,763 cases of foot and mouth disease. This disease was also responsible for the comparative increase in the number of outbreaks as well as attacks. The outstanding feature of these figures is that while the outbreaks and seizures increased in number, the number of deaths showed a decrease of 6,575, compared with the corresponding figures of the previous year. Of the total number of 5,865 outbreaks reported, 5,250 were attended by the staff, the percentage of attendance being about 90 against 95 and 92 of the years 1931-32 and 1932-33, respec- tively. This shortage appears to have been due to the dislocation of work caused by the earthquake during the latter part of the year. 61. According to the area and cattle population of each range, the distribution of the outbreaks, etc., was as follows:12 detection. The outbreak subsided after the necessary precautions were taken and remaining horses protected with anti-anthrax serum. Unlike the previous two years when the Darbhanga Raj horses were seriously affected, this disease was not reported during the year under report in the North Bihar Range. 67. Surra.13 greater during the year, as, out of a total number of 6,659 animals affected, 4,957 deaths were recorded, compared with 5,572 attacks and 4,230 deaths recorded in the year 1932-33. Alto- gether 1,179 outbreaks were brought to notice and of these, 1,155 were attended by the staff. 72. Black Quarter.14 advised preventive measures. Altogether 79 deaths of fowls and other birds from this disease were recorded in Dumka town alone. Preventive inoculation. 77. The position of preventive inoculation was more satis- factory during the year as the old outstanding debts of the local bodies having been cleared and there being no pressing demand for extra expenditure of sera and vaccines, protection by this method could, in most cases, be extended without any difficulty. Reduction in the prices of some of the Muktesar products, especially in that of anti-rinderpest serum has given relief in that a larger number of animals could bo protected without the need of a corresponding increase in the budget allotment of a district board. The net result of all this was that altogether 189,417 cattle could be protected with preventive inoculation in 765 outbreaks, as compared with 164,232 inoculations done in 881 outbreaks in 1932-33. This shows an increase of over 25,000 inoculations. The number would have further increased, had not the normal activities of the department in the interior of the North Bihar Kongo been disturbed for about two months and a half due to the earthquake. 197 inoculated animals died of the disease showing a percentage of .10 death as compared with .11 of the previous year. 78. Details of the work done in each district are furnished in Table III. Of the total number, the North Bihar Range has to its credit 37,338 inoculations, the Central Range 108,358 and the Orissa Range 43,721. 79. Rinderpest.15 81. Goat Virus Inoculation.16 82.

The scheme for the realization of inoculation fees from the owners of cattle in the district of Muzaffarpur over and above the budget provision was approved by Government, and adopted by the district board. The board was, however, not in a position to give effect to it owing to the earthquake disturbance. The same scheme was also adopted by the Darbhanga district board, but that board also could not introduce the system due to the same reason. 88. Rates of sera and vaccines.18 Construction of temporary sheds by the local bodies to accom- modate some of these institutions in urgent cases commenced during the year. 91. Work of veterinary assistant surgeons.23 A new Morris Light Van was purchased in January 1934, for delivering milk in the Bankipur town and is doing good work. The two oil engines, one for crushing grains and the other for irrigation work are also in good working order. 111. Revenue and expenditure.24 CHAPTER V. Provincial Establishment. 116. There was no change in the personnel or jurisdiction of the superior officers of the department except that Mr. M. I. Malik, Special Officer, went oft four months' leave on average pay from the 23rd May 1933 and First Grade Veterinary Inspector Babu Jagat Lal Bose officiated for him. CHAPTER VI. Subordinate Establishment. 117. The number of veterinary inspec ors in charge of circles continued to be 13 as in the previous year. The only important change consisted in Babu J. L. Bose being appointed Officer in charge of the North Bihar Range for four months and his place at Purulia being filled by staff veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi S. B. Ahmad. Another inspector, Babu M. M. Banerji, was transferred from the Central to the North Bihar Range vice Babu H. K. Roy, transferred from that range. There was no change among the staff and reserve veterinary surgeons except that one of the reserve assistants was withdrawn from the Orissa Range and attached to the Central Range. In addition, transfers of certain veterinary assistant surgeons either within the range or from one range to another, were effected, and some were also given grade promotions. Second staff veterinary assistant surgeon Bahu J. Mahanti on completion of his post-graduate course returned to duty in the North Bihar Range in December 1933. Only one new graduate, viz., Babu B. Tirkey, who held a Government stipend, was recruited to the cadre during the year. At the end of the year, the subordinate cadre of the department consisted of 13 veterinary inspectors, 6 staff veteri- nary surgeons, 12 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons, 2 laboratory assistants and 127 district veterinary assistant surgeons (viz. 32 stationary and 95 touring) and their distribu- tion according to the ranges was as follows:21 the farm against 146 calves born in the previous year, and 8 Tharparkar cows with 2 male calves and 5 female calves were purchased, and 1 draught bullock was received from the Veterinary College Laboratory raising the total to 733. Out of this number, there were 13 casualties, 99 animals were sold and 1 Tharparkar bull and 5 cross-bred bulls were distributed free to some district boards in the province, leaving the total strength of the herd at 615 at the end of the year, as shown in Statement A, The average number of cows in milk during the year was 100 against 90 in the year 1932-33, It will be seen from Statement A that 16 Tharparkar heifers of which 1 came with her mother and 15 were born at the farm, were drafted into the herd and their average milk yield was about 12 lbs. per head per day. The 11 Tharparkar heifers drafted to the herd during the year 1932-33 became dry and their average milk yield was 10 to 12 lbs. per head per day daring their first lactation period. 103. 108 animals were vaccinated against rinderpest by goat virus alone method with satisfactory results. The animals of the farm were also protected against hæmorrhagic septicæmia and black quarter as usual. The health of the animals was good throughout the year. 104. Supply of breeding bulls.22 106. Cultivation.25 CHAPTER VII. Laboratories. 118. There was no change in the arrangement of laboratory work. The same two laboratories attached to the range offices at Muzaffarpur and Cuttack did the work for the North Bihar and Orissa Ranges respectively, while the work in respect of the Central Range was carried out at the laboratory attached to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. During the year, altogether 2,724 smears including blood, fæces, pus, urine and other body juices were received and examined at the above three laboratories with the result that diseases were diagnosed in 706 instances as shown below :20 cases (by intravenous injection of Iodine solution), 7 cases of bursattee in horses, 63 cases of skin affection in dogs and 7 of yoke galls in bullocks were treated by the staff and attended either with satisfactory or encouraging results. Nasal granu- loma being very prevalent in the range, especially in the districts of Patna, Gaya and Shahabad, over 13,000 animals affected with the disease were treated with intravenous injec- tions of Pot. Ant. Tart. solution and the result was appreciated. Treatment of cutaneous bleeding in cattle due to filaria hæmor- rhagica by injections of trypanblue or Pot. Ant. Tart. solution, and of foot and mouth disease by application of copper sulph. solution was also adopted in this range. In both cases the result was satisfactory. 121. Orissa Range.27 climatic and dietetic points of view and enquired into the condition of retention of urine in the bullock which appears to be very common in Shahabad district. The officer submitted his usual quarterly and annual reports to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research through the local Government. CHAPTER VIII. Expenditure. 124. The total expenditure of the department including the Veterinary College and the Cattle Farm amounted to Rs. 6,81,825-3-0 as compared with Rs. 6,51,822-7-8 in 1932-33. Out of this sum, Rs. 4,16,504-8-0 were spent from the Provincial Revenues and Rs. 2,65,320-11-0 from the Local Fund budget against Rs. 3,90,576-6-3 and Rs. 2,61,246-1-5 respectively, spent from the same two sources in the previous year. The increase under the head " Provincial " was due to restoration of 5 per cent in the cut of salaries, periodical increments and inclusion of expenditure on veterinary dispensaries in Angul. Compared with the total Provincial Revenues, the expendi- ture incurred by Government for the department was .78 per cent. The total receipts of the department amounted to Rs. 1,12,801-7-3* against Rs. 1,24,013 in the year 1932-33. CHAPTER IX. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 125. The inspector (Babu S. B. Sabai) appointed by the Patna City municipality under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act prosecuted 496 cases out of which 466 ended in conviction (including a few cases of the previous year) as com- pared with 499 cases prosecuted in 1932-33. A sum of Rs. 2,603 was realized as fines from the cases instituted in court. The work was also carried out by the district veterinary assistant surgeons as well as by the Bihar and Orissa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 126. During the year, the financial position of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals improved considerably in consequence of the Government decision to hand over the fines to the Society. It also realized a sum of Rs. 1,200 from a Cinema show organized by Mrs. Ansorge under the patronage of His Excellency the Governor and Lady Sifton. It did not hold its annual show but contributed a sum of Rs. 250 thus saved, to the Viceroy's Earthquake Relief Fund, and further distributed another sum of Rs. 500 to alleviate the suffering of earthquake-affected animals at Muzaffarpur and Menghyr. The Society held several meetings, and at one of them discussed the question of extending its activities to non-municipal areas. Mr. R. T. Davis, I.V.S., * Revised budget.
28 Principal, Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, was elected repre- sentative of the Civil Veterinary Department on the working committee of the Society. The Society employed and controlled four inspectors during the year, all of them being qualified veterinary graduates, and worked in 24 municipalities. It prose- cuted 1,277 cases, out of which 1,143 ended in conviction, and a sum of Rs. 9,429 was realized as fines. 1,135 animals were sent to the veterinary infirmaries for treatment. 127. Including the district work and the work under the Patna City municipality, altogether 2,977 cases were either prose- cuted or sent up for trial under the Act, and out of them, 2,201 ended in conviction, compared with 1,947 cases prosecuted and 1,706 convictions secured in 1932-33. CHAPTER X. Royal Commission on Agriculture. 128. For want of funds no fresh progress could he made during the year in giving effect to the Commission's recom- mendations. Programme of work. 129. The department has the following programme of work to carry out in addition to its normal activities :29 the drug treatment of contagious bovine abortion and published it in the Indian Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry. Babu Nilmoni Chattarji, Assistant Director, Civil Veterinary Department, in charge Orissa Range, read a paper on active immunization of cattle against rinderpest by the goat virus method which was published in the Bihar and Orissa Co-operative Federation Gazette. Dr. A. C. Chaudhuri, B.SC., Ph.D. (Edin.), Professor of Hygiene and Dietetics, Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, presented for publication a paper on mineral requirements in relation to milk yield in dairy cows and also a monograph on the breeds of cattle in India. 133. Acknowledgments.30 The ministerial staff of the office of the Director and the subordinate offices has worked satisfactorily. Major Riley has left on record an appreciation of the most efficient manner in which Babu D. Roy Chaudhuri, the Superintendent, has carried out his duties during the year and recommends Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Maulavi S. A. Quadir for good work. 135. Earthquake.TABLE II.

GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. (MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.) RESOLUTION. The 10th November 1934. READ2 hospitals and to increase the field staff to enable the department to start more field veterinary dispensaries. The matter is primarily for the consideration of the local bodies and it may be hoped that they will utilise the savings effected in their budget on account of the reduced expenditure on sera and vaccine to effect the necessary improvement. 4.The Patna cattle-breeding and dairy farm appears to have been managed with efficiency and success. The average milk yield per cow increased from 8.7 lbs to 9 lbs. while the total milk yield increased from 279,000 lbs. to 327,000 lbs. The total revenue slightly decreased from Rs. 54,573 to Rs. 53,681 while the expenditure increased from Rs. 46,940 to Rs. 48,241. The decrease in revenue was chiefly owing to the milk being sold at six seers per rupee against five seers while the expenditure includes the cost of a motor van for the distribution of milk and the price of eight Tharparkar cows. On the whole, the results may be said to have been satisfactory though the average milk yield per cow per day is still far below the figure of 19.4 lbs. at the Kanke farm under the Department of Agriculture. 5.The Veterinary College records another year of useful work and the results of the annual examinations were satis- factory. The number of students is, however, low and every attempt should be made to attract more students. Here again the local bodies hold the key to the situation ; because, unless they create more avenues of employment by increasing their veterinary staff, it is difficult to make the college more popular. 6.The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has done good work and its finances have been placed on a more stable footing. It may be hoped that the activities of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals coupled with the propaganda work undertaken by the Department and the activities of the Disease Investigation Officer will result in ameliorating the condition of cattle throughout the province. No lasting improvement can, however, be effected so long as the number of cattle is largely in excess of requirements and little interest is taken by the general public in the vitally important question of improved breeding. The treatment of diseases and preventive inoculation are no doubt essential, but these are merely negative aspects of the cattle problem. Unless the positive aspect of improving the breed is appreciated by the public, no real improvement in the situation can be expected. Large quantities of milk and milk products are being imported
3 into the country every year and there is almost unlimited scope for a dairy industry if only the breed of cattle could be improved. Government are prepared to supply suitable breeding bulls free of charge but it is for local bodies to maintain them at suitable centres and educate public opinion on this very important question. 7. The disastrous earthquake of the 15th January 1934 is reported to have been responsible for over 4,000 casualties amongst cattle. The aftermath of the earthquake raised various problems of which the more serious consequences were fortu- nately averted by the prompt relief measures organised by Government, by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and by the Bihar Earthquake Distressed Cattle Belief Committee. 8. In conclusion, Government in the Ministry of Education are pleased to thank Major Riley for his efficient administration of the Department during the year under report. Acknowledg- ments are also due to Mr. Davis for the annual report.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, for the year 1934-35. CHAPTER I. General Administration. I HELD charge of the department for five months during the year, i.e., from 1st April to 12th April 1934, and again from 13th November 1934 to 31st March 1935. During the intervening period of seven months I was on leave, Mr. R. T. Davis, i.v.s., Principal, Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, officiated as Director, Veterinary Services. 2. As in previous years, the Director held adminis- trative charge of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College including the control of the Government Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm, Patna. The work of the Central Range as well as the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar and Orissa, was also carried out under the immediate control of the Director. 3. While on duty 1 visited 8 districts, viz., Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya, Hazaribagh, Manbhum, Ranchi, Palamau and Singhbhum, and inspected 29 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. I assisted in purchasing horses at Calcutta for the Mounted Military Police, Bihar and Orissa, and for the Police Training College, Hazaribagh. 4. As a member of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research I attended the second meeting of the Board held at New Delhi in February 1935. 5. A severe outbreak of Equine Anthrax having occurred among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur, I visited the place and gave personal instructions to the depart- mental staff and the authorities in charge regarding control measures. 6. I acted as a member of the Standing Board of Examiners of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, Patna, and examined the students in Surgery, Animal Management and Shoeing for the annual and diploma examinations of the College for the 5th session. 1 11 D. V. S.
2 I was also appointed by the Government of Bengal a member of the Board of Examiners, and conducted the annual and diploma examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College at Belgachia (Calcutta). I paid a visit to Sonepur Fair. 7. At headquarters, in addition to the usual office routine, I visited the Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm, Patna, occasionally, and once on an official visit, I inspected the farm herd and gave necessary instructions on the disposal of the surplus stock, irrigation and cultivation of crops, etc. 8. During the short period of five months I travelled 2,368 miles by road, in addition to the journeys performed by rail, and was on tour for 57 days. 9. During the period of seven months, Mr. Davis as Officiating Director visited 9 districts, viz., Muzaffarpur, Patna, Shahabad, Ranchi. Manbhum, Cuttack, Puri, Balasore and Angul, inspected 15 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and also saw the work of some field veterinary dispensaries. 10. Mr. Davis inspected the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College on one occasion, and also paid an official visit to the Patna Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm giving necessary instructions regarding irrigation, supply of water and machinery. 11. As a temporary member appointed during my absence on leave, Mr. Davis attended the 1st half-yearly meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla in September 1934. 12. At headquarters, besides office routine, he paid occasional visits to the Patna Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm and interviewed the stipendiary students for admission to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. Mr. Davis also acted as President and Senior Examiner of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for both the half-yearly professional examinations of the subordinate officers held in April and October 1934. 13. He was on tour for 30 days and travelled 226 miles by road, in addition to the usual journeys by rail. 14. In consequence of the earthquake of January 1934 and the severe floods which followed in its wake, the conditions of touring in North Bihar districts were far from satisfactory rendering it difficult to pay the usual visits to those districts during the year.
3 North Bihar Range. 15. Special Officer (now Deputy Director) Mr. M. I. Malik, M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the Range throughout the year. During the period, he inspected 37 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries out of 43, and 22 field veterinary dispensaries out of 57 in the range. He also visited Pusa and Sipaya Farm, as well as the important horse and cattle fairs and shows. 16. Mr. Malik acted as an examiner at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, and at the professional examination of the subordinate veterinary officers at Patna. 17. Besides the above, Mr. Malik attended various other official or semi-official functions, such as the meeting of the Co-operative Federation Congress held at Chapra, a general meeting of the S. P. C. A., acting as a judge at the show, a meeting of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Association at which he was elected its President, the rural welfare training camp at Silaut, the opening ceremony of the Industrial Exhibition by the Hon'ble Minister of Education, and the show of the Purnea City Mela where he acted as a judge. He was also a presiding officer at a polling for election of members to the Legislative Assembly. During the severe floods of the Ganges when the question of feeding the affected cattle became very acute, Mr. Malik helped in the arrangements made by the district authorities for the supply and despatch of fodder to Bihpur. Narainpur, Lattipur, Mohiuddinnagar, Hajipur and Sonepur. The Red Cross Society's Depot which was started after the earthquake, continued to work under his charge for some time early in the year. He was on tour for 179 days and travelled 2,683 miles by road in addition to the journeys by rail. Central Range. 18. Special Officer Mr. S. K. Sen, M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the Range under the direct supervision of the Director. During the year, he inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries of the Range numbering 50, 43 field veterinary dispensaries and the offices of all the 5 circle veterinary inspec- tors. In course of his tour, he further visited various police- stations, and 385 villages where he made enquiries into the existence of cattle disease and verified the work of the subordinate staff, inspected the Mounted Military Police horses twice at Arrah, the Government ponies at the Police Training College, Hazaribagh, the cattle at the Central Jails at Buxar,
4 Hazaribagh and Gaya, the cattle at the Hazaribagh Reformatory School and the newly started municipal dairy farm at Gaya. He further attended the meetings of the Divisional Development Board at Patna and Bhagalpur at which he read papers on various important subjects, the Bihar and Orissa Provincial Exhibition held at Bankipore and also an Exhibition and Cattle Show at Daltonganj which was opened by the Hon'ble Sir Courtney Terrell, Kt., Chief Justice, in March 1935. 19. Mr. Sen acted as a member and Secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for the professional examinations of subordinate officers held in April, and as Secretary only at the same examinations held in October 1934. He was appointed an examiner, and examined the students in Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Breeding at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. He also delivered lectures to the cadets of the Hazaribagh Police Training College on common contagious diseases of cattle, and on their general management. 20. During the year, efforts were made by Mr. Sen to increase the strength of the subordinate veterinary service, and as a result the post of 3rd touring veterinary assistant surgeon in the Sadr subdivision of Gaya district at Tikari has been sanctioned. He moved the district board, Patna, for the creation of a new post of touring veterinary assistant surgeon at Bakhtiarpur and also the district board, Monghyr, for another such post at Lakhisarai. Most likely both these posts will be sanctioned. A flood having occurred in Dinapore area of Patna district, Mr. Sen made a special tour with a view to getting an idea of the loss of cattle in that locality 21. He spent 125 days on tour and travelled 4,843 miles by road, in addition to the railway journeys during the year. The above itself is a heavy list. This together with the account of the work detailed in subsequent pages shows that Mr. Sen worked with great zeal. Orissa Range. 22. Assistant Director, Babu Nilmoni Chattarji, held charge of the Range throughout the year. During the period he inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries of the range except those at Phulbani and Kendrapara. He also inspected the offices of the veterinary inspectors, Cuttack and Chaibassa Circles, the cattle sheds of the Purulia municipality and the cattle of the Purulia and Cuttack Jails.
6 23. In course of his tours in the interior, the Assistant Director visited 285 villages and 11 field veterinary dispen- saries, supervised the work of goat virus inoculations in Cuttack, Puri and Angul, checked the general work of the subordinate staff and made personal enquiries into an anthrax outbreak among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur and gave necessary instructions. He also attended a meeting of the Divisional Develop- ment Board at Balasore and read a paper on active immunisa- tion of cattle against rinderpest by the goat virus alone method, besides delivering other lectures in villages on the utility of the department, as well as on goat tissue virus inoculation. 24. Babu Nilmoni Chattarji acted as a member of the Board of Examiners at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College at Belgachia (Calcutta). 25. He was on tour for 121 days and travelled 4,663 miles by road, in addition to the journeys made by rail. (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer. 26. Mr L. Sahai, M.SC., M.R.C.V.S., the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar and Orissa, held his post throughout the year, thus completing the 3rd year of his appointment. During the period he spent 166 days on tour and travelled 7,001 miles by road, in addition to the journeys performed by rail. 27. While on tour, besides investigation, Mr. Sahai per- formed inoculations against rinderpest by goat tissue virus method in extension of the work done by him during the previous year, and carried out some very important experi- ments in that connection. He also attended such outbreaks of special interest as that of a fluke disease, parasitic infesta- tion, Johne's disease, filaria hæmorrhagica and contagious otorrhæa in buffaloes, an outbreak of suspected plant poisoning among horses, fowl diseases, and the outbreak of anthrax among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur. He visited the Sonepur and Singheswarasthan fairs in connec- tion with investigation of diseases. When at headquarters, Mr. Sahai, besides office routine, worked in the laboratory examining and studying the material brought from the interior. He also served as an examiner in the subjects of Pathology and Bacteriology and Meat and Milk Inspection at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College.
6 28. Mr. Sahai has been doing invaluable work in furtherance of the cause of the veterinary profession in this province, and has fully justified his appointment. CHAPTER II. Veterinary Instruction. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. 29. Charge.7 (from the S. P. C. A.) In addition to these, some temporary arrangements were also made to fill up leave vacancies. The three posts of assistants to Professors continued vacant during the year. The particulars of the staff employed are shown in Table VII. 34. (a) Admission of students.8 The Post-Graduate training was suspended during the year owing to some unavoidable reasons, chiefly because no officer could be deputed from the department. Arrangements were, however, in progress for starting a shorter refresher course of three months at less expense from the next session. The students with a few exceptions, lived in the hostel attached to the College, and their general health was good. One of the professors, appointed warden, looked after their comforts. The Hygiene, Anatomy, Materia Medica and Chemistry and Biology Sections, all worked well, while the stock of the College Library books was augmented by fresh purchases. Four text-books were presented to the library by the Principal, Mr. Davis. (c) Veterinary Hospital.9 The programme of research at the College for the year 1935-36 is as follows:10 CHAPTER III. Treatment of diseases. 37. Incidence of Contagious Diseases.11 disease was more widespread during the year under report. The number of deaths also decreased by 434. 39. Of the total number of 4,158 outbreaks reported, 3,572 were attended by the staff which gives a percentage of 86 attendances, against 90 and 95 respectively of the previous two years, 1933-34 and 1932-33. This decrease was apparently due to the fact that in addition to their attendances at field veterinary dispensaries, the touring veterinary assistant surgeons in many districts were also required to pay greater attention to goat virus work from the commencement of the cold season. Unless the number of touring assistants is increased there is every likelihood of a gradual falling off in attendances of actual outbreaks as goat virus work pro- gresses,12 (b) Dourine.13 (e) Other Equine (Contagious) Diseases.14 47. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.15 Tuberculosis (1) and by some other diseases which could not be diagnosed. Others. 51. 160 deaths were brought to notice comprising 54 from fowl cholera, 51 from rabies, 5 from ovine tetanus, 1 from canine distemper and the rest were unclassified. Out of 12 cases of rabies in dogs in the North Bihar Range, 6 were protected with antirabic vaccine. Five brains from suspected rabid dogs were despatched from the North Bihar Range to the Pasteur Institute with the result that 4 of them proved positive to negri bodies. An outbreak of parasitic infection (Bilharziosis), was discovered in Singhbhum District. The (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer thoroughly investigated the disease and advised preventive measures. A detailed account of this out- break will be found under section " Investigation ". Preventive Inoculations. 52. The position of preventive inoculations greatly improved during the year due to the clearing up by the District Boards of their old outstandings and reduction in the price of certain Muktesar products. The goat blood virus and goat tissue virus methods have since come to our aid, further redu- cing the cost per inoculation against rinderpest. With these advantages at its disposal, the department has been able not only to return to its original position but also to give protection to the greatest number of animals since the Province was created, with the exception of only two years i.e., 1928-29 and 1929-30 when epidemics were at their highest. It is also most gratifying to note that the District Boards did not consider it generally advisable to reduce their respective budget grants for sera and vaccines at the very outset in view of the reduction in the cost of Muktesar products. Only the District Board, Gaya, have so far agreed to a reduction on the recommendation of the department as they had some surplus funds to utilise, and they have used the actual savings on the creation of an additional post of touring veterinary assistant surgeon. Altogether 316,772 animals were protected during the year by the different methods in 784 outbreaks, as compared with 189,417 animals protected in 765 outbreaks in 1933-34. Out of the inoculated, 641 animals died showing percentage of a little over .2 mortality. In addition, 49 horses were also protected by anti-anthrax serum in 2 outbreaks in the Orissa Range.
16 According to ranges, 81,327 inoculations were performed in the North Bihar Range, 187,789 in the Central and 47,705 in the Orissa Range. Details of the work according to each district and disease are given in Table III. 53. Rinderpest.17 56. In North Bihar Range, the blood virus method was abandoned after 1,372 animals including 45 buffaloes were immunised by it in 4 districts (Saran, Champaran, Darbhanga and Purnea) against 226 done in the previous year. With goat tissue virus, 40,558 animals including 4,353 buffaloes were immunised and out of these, 58 including 11 buffaloes died. The Champaran district had the record number of 16,440 inoculations. This method of immunisation is stated to be now very popular and is being cordially welcomed by the local bodies of the Range. 57. In the Central Range, the tissue virus work was undertaken on a big scale with the definite object of stopping the outbreaks of rinderpest by giving bovines and buffaloes a long standing immunity. The work was therefore done in all the districts, and by almost all the veterinary assistant surgeons. It is gaining in popularity among the villagers of the range. Altogether 94,697 animals including 11,075 buffaloes were immunised by blood, as well as tissue virus in 532 villages. Of these, 649 were done by blood virus. The figures include the work of the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer also as shown below. 58. In the Orissa Range, out of a total of 26,507 animals, 14,916 were immunised by the goat blood virus method in the districts of Cuttack, Puri, Angul, Singhbhum and Sambalpur. The tissue virus method could not be adopted in this range sufficiently early with the result that not more than 11,591 animals including 18 buffaloes were immunised in the course of 2 months during the year. None of the inoculated animals died although most of them showed decided normal reaction. 59. The (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer carried out 4,723 inoculations by the goat tissue virus alone method including 346 buffaloes. Goat virus work has, so far, been conducted in the absence of outbreaks. This in itself is very satisfactory as it gives an effective protection to healthy animals against a possible outbreak. But in order to derive full benefit from the operation, it should also be carried out in actual outbreaks, so as to gradually do away with anti-rinderpest serum. An experiment was therefore made by the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer by inoculating out of the total number, 672 animals (80 buffaloes and 592 bovines) in the face of actual outbreaks of rinderpest. The result was that, while there was no mortality among the inoculated in the absence of outbreaks, the mortality in face of outbreaks amounted to 2.6 per cent for buffaloes and bovines combined. This mortality was due apparently either to the animals being then in the incubation period of the disease, or to the inoculated ones 3 11 D. V. S.
18 getting infected by contact with the diseased before the immunity could be established. The detailed results of these experiments will be found in statement A and B. 60. The above results were, however, very encouraging, especially in view of the longer immunity the new method gives, and it is in contemplation to adopt the method in face of actual outbreaks with due precautions, along with the operations done in the absence of an outbreak. 61. Arrangements for obtaining the tattooing machines with figures etc., for purposes of record were completed during the year, and the Range Officers were requested to include one machine for each dispensary in its annual indent. 62. " Serum Simultaneous " Inoculation.19 66. Supply of Sera and Vaccines.20 Number of animals treated. 70. Except the revival of the post of touring veterinary assistant surgeon at Tikari which was sanctioned by Govern- ment, no other new post could be created during the year. The district board, Patna, have, however, approved of the creation of the post of 2nd touring veterinary assistant surgeon for the subdivision of Barh and agreed to locate the dispensary at Bukhtiarpur. The proposal is now under the consideration of Government. A proposal for the appointment of a touring veterinary assistant surgeon by the municipality, Madhupur (Santal Parganas), is also under consideration, while the district board, Champaran, have resolved to appoint two additional touring veterinary assistant surgeons for that dis- trict. All the wealthier district boards of the province were approached to create new posts of touring veterinary assistant surgeons out of their savings in the budget provisions for serum, and it is understood some of them are considering the question in earnest. As the matter is of vital interest to livestock owners, it is hoped that those boards which can afford to allot funds, will do their best to expedite their proposal and relieve this Department of its present strain without delay. Nothing further has yet been heard regarding the proposed abolition of the two posts of additional touring assistants at Jamui and Begusarai in the district of Monghyr but the headquarters of the 2nd assistant of Jamui have since been shifted to Jhajha (East Indian Railway) with a new veterinary dispensary opened there. 71. Construction of dispensaries.21 73. Of the total number of 354,831 fresh patients, 31,906 were treated for contagious disease, 225,583 for non-contagious disease, and 97,342 as castrations; according to ranges, 115,239 patients were treated in the North Bihar, 139,444 in the Central and 100,148 in the Orissa Range. 74. The touring veterinary assistant surgeons visited 56,970 villages during the year against 53,604 visited by the same number of assistants in 1933-34, which shows an increase of 3,366 villages contributed mainly by the North Bihar and Central Ranges. Details of the work under all heads are shown in Table IV. 75. Field Veterinary Dispensaries.22 patients not brought to the hospitals, were supplied with medicines, against 17,335 castrations done and 12,774 patients supplied with medicines during 1933-34. Of the total number of 93,587 patients, 45,720 were treated at 14 hospitals of the North Bihar Range, 31,603 at 11 hospitals of the Central Range and 16,264 at 8 hospitals of the Orissa Range The figures for castrations were 11,117 for North Bihar, 6,261 for the Central and 1,952 for Orissa Range. The other details are shown in Table V. CHAPTER IV. Breeding Operations. 79. Control of livestock improvement.23 Cattle Farm. Patna Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm. 82. Staff.24 All the country cows were purchased in the year 1927 and have become old, and consequently, the milk yield is gradually decreasing. Some of the Tharparkar cows are also on the old side. The total number of Tharparkar cows in milk through- out the year was 55 of which 28 were purchased, and their average daily milk yield per head was 11.6 lbs.; the remaining 27 were born on the farm and drafted into the herd, and their average daily milk yield per head was 12 lbs. 86. The total quantity of milk sold during the year was 357,0943/4 lbs. against 299,507½ lbs. during the previous year showing an increase of 57,5871/4 lbs. In addition to the sale of milk, 531 lbs. of cream and 348 lbs. 14 ozs. of ghee were also sold during the year. Out of the balance of 34,3691/4 lbs. of milk, 8,500 lbs. were lost in pasteurising, measuring and bottling, etc., 21,520 lbs. were separated for cream and ghee and the remaining 4,2491/4 lbs. were fed to the calves. 87. Cultivation.25 the matter was brought to the notice of Government bv Mr. Davis. To tide over the situation it was proposed that the farm should be allowed the use of the tube-well existing on the Camp Jail for a certain part of the year. To be of any benefit to the rabi crops the tube-well should be worked for the farm at least for four months from November to February when the supply is required, and not from March to June as recently sanctioned by Government. A revised proposal to this effect has since been submitted. 90. Buildings.26 94. The other event was the panic created at Singheswar fair by the sudden illness of two elephants when the mela was in full swing. On receipt of this information from the Dis- trict Magistrate of Bhagalpur the (Veterinary) Disease Investi- gation Officer was sent to Singheswar, while Mr. Malik also proceeded there. Of the two sick elephants, one had already died, and the other which was beyond all hope of recovery, also succumbed. A third elephant was also reported to have been ill, but as it was taken away, the information could not be confirmed on enquiry. The post-mortem examination held by Mr. Malik did not reveal any lesions for arriving at a definite diagnosis. The death of the two elephants was probably due to heat stroke. 95. Of the 22 fairs and shows on the list, the Sitamarhi fair was not held during the year. Altogether 259,954 animals were presented for sale, as compared with 211,707 in the year 1933-34. The average price per bullock, cow and buffalo was on the increase. The details of the fairs and shows are given in Tables XIII and XIV. 96. According to the figures supplied by the District Traffic Superintendent, Bengal and North-Western Railway Company, Limited, 3,811 bullocks, 883 buffaloes and 223 cows, or a total of 4,917 animals were booked by rail to various places from stations on Sonepur district of the said Railway The number for the previous year was 4,331. CHAPTER V. Establishment. Provincial. 97. There was no change in the personnel or jurisdiction of superior officers of the department the same 3 officers, Messrs. Malik, Sen and Chattarji having been in charge of their respective ranges throughout the year. Subordinate. 98. The number of veterinary inspectors was 13 as before. An important change was effected during the year in regard to the appointment of staff veterinary assistant surgeons. Government were pleased, on my recommendation, to limit the appointment to a period of three years, with the option allowed to the Director, Veterinary Services, of extending the same
27 in special cases. In consequence of these orders, out of the six staff veterinary assistant surgeons, four, viz. Maulavi S. B. Ahmad and Babus J. Mahanti, P. Gartia and D. Dey who had more than three years' service as staff, reverted to the district cadre, their places being filled by other assistants transferred from the districts. Another staff veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu S. D. Narayan would also revert shortly on the same ground. Maulavi S. B. Ahmad officiated as inspector in place of Babu S. R. Bagchi granted leave. Laboratory Assistant, Babu J. N. Mukharji (Cuttack) was transferred to act as Laboratory Assistant at the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College (Patna) vice Babu P. Panda who was appointed Laboratory Assistant at Cuttack. 99. Mutual transfers of some veterinary assistant surgeons either within the Range, or from one Range to another, for convenience of work were also effected, and some were given grade promotions. One of the veterinary assistant surgeons, Babu S. K. Mukharji, resigned, while the services of two others, Babus S. P. Das and B. Tirkey were dispensed with for unsatisfactory work. It is regretted that the department also sustained loss in the untimely death of another capable veterinary assistant surgeon, Babu M. Upadhya who had put in more than 11 years' service. Only 1 veterinary graduate, Maulavi M. A. Jabbar, who was a cruelty inspector, was recruited to the department during the year. 100. At the close of the year, the subordinate staff of the department consisted of 13 veterinary inspectors, 6 staff veterinary assistant surgeons, 2 laboratory assistants, 12 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 126 district veterinary assistant surgeons, viz. 31 stationary and 95 touring. CHAPTER VI. Laboratories. 101. The arrangement of the laboratory work continued to be the same, i.e. the work for the North Bihar and Orissa ranges was carried out at the range laboratories respectively at Muzaffarpur and Cuttack, while that for the Central Range, the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College and the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, at the College Laboratory. Arrangements were also made during the year for the (Veteri- nary) Disease Investigation Officer and the Special Officer in charge of the Central Range to diagnose diseases in a room attached to the Director's office at Patna.
28 102. During the year altogether 1,459 smears including blood, faeces, pus, urine were received and examined at the above laboratories with the result that diseases were diagnosed in 520 instance as follows : 29 severity occurred in the groups receiving smaller doses just as they occurred in groups which received larger ones. (ii) Determination of the duration of immunity.30 existed in that area for some considerable time. It however took a serious proportion during the year following the scar- city of fodder due to the earthquake. The animals were turned out to graze on the Bharthua Choer which favoured a rapid growth of the causal parasite, Fasciola gigantica, resulting in widespread infection. The disease was however, soon brought under control by the Disease Investigation Officer by the adoption of Carbon Tetrachloride which is a specific. By the end of the year about 500 animals were treated without any untoward result. The treatment is still being continued. (b) Parasitic infestation (Bilharziosis) in Singhbhum District.31 District was investigated, confirmed and the parasite demons- trated in the lesions. The disease is characterised by the formation of nodules all over the body which break down and cause hæmorrhage. Treatment with tartar emetic on the same lines as in the treatment of nasal granuloma (8-12 grains dis- solved in 20-25 c. c. of water) was tried which gave good results in 2 or 3 injections, as fresh nodule formation ceased, and there was general improvement in health. (e) Contagious Otorrhæa.32 adoption of suitable measures including the giving of fresh grass in the ration, it subsided. The total loss from the out- break was well over 150 which included practically all the chicks hatched out that season. It was only after repeated bacteriological examinations that the suspicion of an infectious disease could be eliminated. Helminth Parasites. 108. During the year (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer made a further collection of helminth parasites which were examined and identified. CHAPTER VII. 109. The total expenditure of the department including the Veterinary College and the Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm amounted to Rs. 6,77,067-3-0, against Rs. 6,81,825-3-0 in the year 1933-34. Out of this amount, a sum of Rs. 4,21,684-11-5 was spent from the Provincial Revenues, and Rs. 2,55,382-7-7 from the Local Fund budget, as compared with Rs. 4,16,504-8-0 and Rs. 2,65,320-11-0 respectively, spent from the same sources during the previous year. The figures under the head " Provincial " include the expenditure incurred on account of the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer 110. The increase in the total amount of expenditure under head " Provincial " is apparently due to the periodical increments in pay, while the decrease in the amount under " Local " is mainly due to less expenditure on sera and vaccines on account of the reduction in the prices of Muktesar products, as also the introduction on a larger scale of goat virus inoculations. The details under each head are shown in Table XIV(A). 111. Compared with the total Provincial Revenues,* the expenditure incurred by Government for the maintenance of the department amounted to .62 per cent, against .78 in the previous year. The total receipts of the department were Rs. 1,21,048-14-5 as compared with Rs. 1,12,801-7-3 in 1933-34. CHAPTER VIII. General Remarks. 112. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.33 The Bihar and Orissa S. P. C. A. employed 6 inspectors during the year and worked over 30 municipalities. It held its annual general meeting under the presidency of Lady Sifton and also an animal show at Patna at which prizes were given for milch cows, bulls and bullocks, milch buffaloes, horses and ponies, etc. His Excellency the Governor and Lady Sifton attended the show. Fines amounting to Rs. 9,446 were received by the Society. 113. Including the work of the cruelty inspector under the Patna City Municipality and the district work done by the veterinary assistant surgeons, altogether 3,001 cases were either reported or prosecuted under the Cruelty to Animals Act, and out of them, 2,366 ended in convictions. 114. Propaganda.34 Nagpur districts of Ranchi, Manbhum and Singhbhum with the staff attached, in the residual portion of the Province. The question of administration of these three districts is now receiv- ing attention. The preliminary work of the separation of the budget estimate and records for Orissa is in progress. 117. Paper written or published.35 120. Among the gazetted officers Messrs. S. K. Sen and Lakshmi Sahai, and also Farm Manager Babu N. N. Ghosh did particularly good work throughout the year. The Head Office ministerial staff carried out their duties most efficiently under the able guidance of the Superintendent Babu D. Ray Chaudhuri. The range office staff at Muzaffarpur and Cuttack worked satisfactorily under their respective head clerks. According to Mr. Davis, the ministerial staff of the College under head clerk Babu Raghunandan Sahay, and also the Farm Clerk worked well during the year. P. B.

GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA. (MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.) RESOLUTION. The 6th December 1935. READ2 recorded in the previous year. Deaths from rinderpest showed an increase from 8,467 in 1933-34 to 10,531 in 1934-35. This was mainly due to the exceptional virulence of the disease in the Santal Parganas, and a severe epidemic in South Monghyr as a result of a flood in August 1934. There was consider- able improvement in preventive inoculations, which was largely due to the fact that the goat blood virus and goat tissue virus methods have reduced considerably the cost of inoculation against rinderpest. The total number of animals protected during the year by the different methods of inoculation was 316,772 as compared with 189,417 in 1933-34. Out of the inoculated animals 641 only died, the percentage of mortality being little over 2. Government are also pleased to note that prompt and efficient action was taken by the depart- ment to check a serious epidemic among horses at the Sonepur fair. 3. The number of veterinary hospitals remained stationary at 33, but the number of patients treated increased from 91,527 in 1933-34 to 93,587. The number of castrations performed in the veterinary hospitals was 19,330 while 13,324 patients not brought to the hospitals were supplied with medicines. The corresponding figures for 1933-34 were 17.335 and 12,774, respectively. It is an encouraging sign that field veterinary dispensaries, which have been in existence for only three years, are steadily gaining in popularity. Their number increased from 134 in 1933-34 to 139 and 123,075 animals were given treatment as against 100,730 in 1933-34. The increase of work has caused a heavy strain on the staff. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the staff of touring veterinary assistant surgeons, if outbreaks of epidemic diseases are to be properly attended to. This is a matter which deserves the serious consideration of local bodies. 4. The Patna cattle-breeding and dairy farm registered another successful year of working. The average milk yield per cow increased from 9 lbs. to 9.8 lbs. while the total milk yield increased from 327,000 lbs. to 391,000 lbs. The total revenue increased from Rs. 53,681 to Rs. 60,789 while the total expenditure increased from Rs. 48,241 to Rs 52,166. The total quantity of milk sold was 357,000 lbs. against 299.000 lbs. in 1933-34. In addition 531 lbs. of cream and 348 lbs. of ghee were sold as against 336 lbs. and 243 lbs., respectively, in 1933-34. The average number of cows in milk during the year was 111 against 100 in the previous year. The
3 question of the irrigation of the crops on the farm from the tube-well in the camp jail during the four months from November to February is under the consideration of Govern- ment. It is hoped that it will be possible to overcome the existing difficulties in regard to irrigation. 5. The Veterinary College continued to do useful work. The total number of students in the beginning of the session was 56 against 52 and 46 in the two previous sessions. The number of admissions was 25 as against 24 in 1933-34 and 10 in 1932-33. The students with a few exceptions lived in the hostel attached to the College. The results of the examinations were satisfactory. The expenditure under the different heads was Rs. 76,422 as against Rs. 84,210 in the preceding year. The four professors of the College were appointed on contract which will terminate on the 30th April 1936. The Director of Veterinary Services has been requested to submit a report on the working of the College by the end of November 1935 to enable Government to consider future arrangements after the 30th April 1936. It is disappointing to note that the research laboratory has not yet produced any tangible result of value. Government await the proposals of the Director for improving its efficiency and usefulness. 6. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals employed six inspectors during the year and has extended its jurisdiction to 30 municipalities. Altogether 3,001 cases were either reported or prosecuted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and out of them 2,366 ended in con- viction. After the earthquake of January 1934 there was a scarcity of fodder and water-supply in certain areas of North Bihar. The society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took immediate steps to relieve the situation in co-operation with Government and the Bihar Earthquake Cattle Relief Society. Government are also pleased to note the efforts which are being made for the amelioration of the condition of animals by means of propaganda. 5,023 lectures on various subjects were delivered by the staff of the Civil Veterinary Department at important gatherings, such as fairs and shows, village, markets and meetings of associations. 7. An alarming situation was created in the North Bihar Range by the repeated floods of the Ganges. It is reported that over three thousand animals died in the floods. The Range Officer tackled the situation energetically by making a survey of
4 the flood-stricken areas and arranging with the District Magistrate of Muzaffarpur for the distribution of fodder. 8. The Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Service, class I, was constituted with effect from the 1st April 1935 to take the place of the Indian Veterinary Service. The strength of the service is four, viz., two Deputy Directors, the Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology and the Professor of Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Breeding at the Veterinary College. Mr. M. I. Malik, M.R.C.V.S., who was employed on a temporary basis in charge of the North Bihar Range, has been appointed as a Deputy Director on probation for a period of two years. Mr. Davis holds a lien on the other post of Deputy Director and the two posts of professors have not been filled up as the existing incumbents were appointed on contracts which has not yet expired. 9. Government are pleased to note the names of the officers commended by the Director for good work and their thanks are due to Major Riley and Mr. Davis for the efficient administration of the Department.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, for the year 1935-36. CHAPTER I. General Administration. I HELD charge of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, throughout the year. In addition to my duties as Director, Veterinary Services, I acted as Principal, Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, Patna, for seven months from the 19th April to the 17th November, 1935, while the permanent Principal, Mr. R. T. Davis, I.V.S., was on leave. Being the Head of the Department I was also in administrative charge of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College including the control of the Govern- ment Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm, Patna and the work of the Central Range and the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar and Orissa, was carried out under my direct supervision and control. 2. While in charge of the College I reorganized the working of the hospital, laboratory and library sections and regularised the fees accounts which all proved conducive to economy as well as efficiency. I also organized for the department a Goat Tissue Virus (inoculation) campaign against Rinderpest which com- menced on the 1st October and ended the 31st March. 3. As the existing syllabus of the College was found defective, I undertook to prepare a more elaborate and detailed one useful to all concerned, which was approved by Govern- ment. Revision of the Provisional Prospectus (Rules and Regulations) with the object of making it final received full consideration also during the year. 4. Though there was a greater demand on my presence at headquarters on account of my additional duties at the College and various other matters, I managed to visit 11 districts, (viz., Patna, Gaya, Shahabad, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Cham- paran, Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Manbhum, Singhbhum and Puri) and inspected 41 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and also the office of the Deputy Director, North Bihar Range, Muzaffarpur. 1 9 DVS
2 5. As a member of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research I attended the meetings of the Board for its two sessions at Simla and New Delhi; at the latter place, I attended the Conference of the All-India Animal Husban- dry Workers. 6. As a member of the Board of Examiners, I examined the students at the Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta for its annual and diploma examinations for 1935-36. Being a member of the standing Examination Board for the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College I made the preliminary arrangements for holding the annual and diploma examinations of the College for its 6th session and also acted as an examiner. 7. At Calcutta I assisted in the purchase of horses for the Mounted Military Police, Bihar and Orissa, and inspected the horses of the same Police Force at Arrah and Jamshedpur. 8. I was busily engaged at headquarters in connection with questions arising out of the separation of the Orissa Division and its inclusion in the new province of Orissa. The records, the budget and the cadre for the transferred area were duly separated. 9. For the convenience of administration, it was considered expedient to create a new sub-range comprising the three Chota Nagpur districts of Manbhum, Singhbhum and Ranchi (with Ranchi as headquarters) and placing the area under an officer of Class II Veterinary Service, i.e., an Assistant Director. The proposals which were accordingly drawn up, received the sanc- tion of Government, and the funds being also voted, all the preliminary arrangements for starting the office from the 1st April 1936, were completed during the year. 10. The Bihar and Orissa Provincial Exhibition which was held at Patna in February 1936, received my attention as I attended the Exhibition Committee's meetings, and gave personal instructions to the Range Officer, Mr. Sen, in organising a show of the Department and making it a success. 11. During the year, I further, acted as President of the. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for the half- yearly professional examinations of subordinate officers which were held in April and October, L935, and also interviewed and selected the students for the Bihar and Orissa Government and district board stipends for admission to the Veterinary College. 12. I paid frequent visits to the Patna Cattle Farm. I was on tour for 92 days and travelled 2,639 miles by road, in addition to the journeys performed by rail.
3 North Bihar Range. 13. Deputy Director Mr. M. I. Malik, B.SC., M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the North Bihar Range throughout the year except for three days. During the period, Mr. Malik inspected all the veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, in his range and 17 rural veterinary dispensaries ; he visited the Government Farms at Pusa, Sabour and Sipaya, and also the important fairs and shows of the range. He personally attended and took necessary steps at an outbreak of parasitic diarrh4 Mounted Military Police Force at Arrah twice, and also the ponies belonging to the Police Training College at Hazaribagh. He further delivered a lecture on the common contagious diseases of cattle to the cadets of the Police Training College (Hazaribagh) and examined the Government animals at the Buxar and Hazari- bagh Central Jails ; attended a meeting of departmental gazetted officers at Patna and a meeting of the S. P. C. A. committee. 19. Mr. Sen also acted as an examiner in Hygiene, Dietetics and Animal Husbandry at the annual and diploma examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, as well as examiner and secretary to the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for the half-yearly professional examinations of sub- ordinate officers in April and October, 1935. 20. Under the supervision of the Director, Veterinary Services, Mr. Sen organised the Veterinary Section of the Bihar and Orissa Provincial Exhibition held at Patna during February 1936. Due to his special endeavours, a large number of goat tissue virus inoculations were carried out in the Central Range. 21. During the year under report, Mr. Sen was on tour for 102 days and travelled 4,311 miles by road besides the journeys by rail. Orissa Range. 22. Assistant Director Babu Nilmoni Chatterji held charge of the Orissa Range throughout the year. During the period, he inspected 31 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries out of a total 35 of the Range, the exceptions being Kendrapara, Bhadrak, Simdega and the newly-opened veterinary dispensary at Cuttack. He also inspected the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshedpur. 23. In course of his tours in the interior, Babu Nilmani Chattarji visited 235 villages and 11 rural veterinary dispen- saries, enquired into the prevalence of contagious live stock diseases, supervised the goat tissue virus (inoculation) work in 7 districts, delivered lectures on the general utility of the Veterinary Department and the advantages of the tissue virus inoculation against rinderpest, attended a meeting each of the District Board Ranchi, and the Veterinary Dispensary Com- mittee, Balasore, and also the gazetted veterinary officers' conference at Patna. 24. He was, moreover, appointed a member of Examination Board of the Bengal Veterinary College and examined the
5 students of the said college at the annual and diploma exa- minations for 1935-36. He was also appointed a member of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary Examination Board for the half- yearly professional examination of subordinate veterinary officers held at Patna in April 1935. 25. He was on tour for 103 days and travelled 4,037 miles by road in addition to the railway journeys. 26. During the year the office godown of the Assistant Director, Civil Veterinary Department at Cuttack was improved by the addition of one room for storage of serum. (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer. 27. Mr. L. Sahai, M.SC., M.R.C.V.S., the (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer, Bihar and Orissa, held charge of his duties throughout the year thus completing the 4th year of the appointment. During the period he was on tour for 111 days and travelled 1,700 miles by road besides the usual railway journeys. While at headquarters, he, in addition to office work, worked in the laboratory examining and studying material brought from the interior. Much of his time at headquarters was also absorbed in carrying out experiments in connection with rinderpest. 28. Mr. Sahai attended the Animal Husbandry Research Workers' Conference at New Delhi in February 1936 when he read a paper on " the diagnosis and control of Doyle's Disease of Fowls". He served as an examiner in the subjects of Shoeing, Pathology and Bacteriology, and Meat and Milk Inspection at the Annual and Diploma Examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College, Patna, for the session 1935-36. 29. During the year, Mr. Sahai received further training for about two months at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, where he, besides going round the different sections and familiarising himself with the latest developments, worked on certain aspects of Johne's disease and Doyle's Disease of Fowls and examined samples of milk from several cows for Johne's bacilli. The Animal Husbandry Expert to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research visited his office at Patna towards the end of the year and discussed certain disease problems with him. 30. Mr. Sahai has put in another year of very useful work towards investigation of live stock diseases in this province.
6 CHAPTER II. Veterinary Instruction. Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College. 31. Charge.7 Province and 1 from Hyderabad (Deccan). Seven newly-admit- ted students having left the college the total number at the end of the session came down to 64 as follows :8 Type Government quarters and their general health was satis- factory. Lecturer, Mr. M. B. Bose acted as warden for the session. The stock of the College library books was further increased by fresh purchases and also by the presentation of 19 text books for use of the stipendiary students made by the chairman of the district board of Hazaribagh, to whom thanks are due. 37. Veterinary Hospital.9 animals. 63 animals of this farm were also immunised against rinderpest by goat tissue virus and the immunity tests of those vaccinated previously were also carried out. 40. The routine work of the laboratory consisted in the examination of 1,043 specimens including blood smears, pus, faeces, urine, skin scrapings, etc, against 746 in the previous year. Out of these, diseases were diagnosed in 500 cases. Details are shown under the head " Laboratories ". Postmortem exami- nation was carried out on 49 animals and 10 pathological specimens were collected and sent to the Museum duly mounted. The photo and art section of the laboratory did important work for demostration classes and also for the Bihar and Orissa Provincial Exhibition. 41. The programme of research at the college for the year 1936-37 is as follows:10 to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, Mr. F. Ware, F.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., paid a visit to the college in December 1935. The arrangement by which the Sports Section was placed under Lecturer, Mr. Akbari, as its permanent secretary, proved more satisfactory than that of appointing a secretary from among the students. 44. Professional Examination and Training.11 very satisfactory to note that none of these diseases except haemorrhagic septicaemia was reported in Saran. The districts of Cuttack and Puri maintained complete freedom from rinder- pest as in the previous years while the mortalities in Saran, Champaran, Puri and Angul were kept low. The condition of Sambalpur was however most unsatisfactory. Except black- quarter all other diseases were reported in it. On account of its peculiar position having States on all sides and an inade- quate staff employed by the local authority this district has become a constant source of infection to live stock and the sooner some special measures for controlling diseases are taken the better. The Assistant Director, Veterinary Services, Orissa, has recommended an increase of staff and adoption of quaran- tine measures. While an increase in subordinate veterinary staff is essential and can be effected forthwith provided funds are available, it is not so easy to place a quarantine measure in a district like Sambalpur. It is now for the Government of Orissa to consider what measures should actually be adopted. The greatest mortality was recorded in the Santal Parganas and next to that were Sambalpur and Hazaribagh. 47. Taking into account the five diseases noticed above, altogether 5,403 outbreaks were brought to light during the year and in those outbreaks, out of a total number of 178,236 animals attacked, 9,794 died, as compared with 4,158 outbreaks, 122,840 attacks and 14,539 deaths recorded in the year 1934-35. It is very encouraging to note that in spite of an apparent increase in the number of both outbreaks and seizures which was mostly due to the affection of foot and mouth disease, the number of deaths reported was less by 4,745. During the year greater attention was paid to miscellaneous other diseases especially to the Ranikhet disease, with the result that in addition to the mortalities reported above, 1,682 deaths were also recorded, compared with 160 only in the previous year. 12 deaths were recorded under the head " Equine" as well. 48. Of the total number of 5,403 outbreaks under head "Bovine" 4,636 were attended by the staff which gives a per- centage of 85.8 attendances against 86 in 1934-35. Goat Virus work and attendance at rural veterinary dispensaries again account for the small decrease. It is impossible to effect any further improvement in the attendance of outbreaks unless the subordinate staff is sufficiently increased.
12 49. The statistics of the outbreaks, seizures, deaths, etc., according to the area and live stock of each range are shown in the following table :13 Tetanus.14 235 animals died, as compared with 44 outbreaks and 246 deaths recorded in the year 1934-35. Heaviest mortalities were recorded in the district of Santal Parganas. A report on the occurrence of these outbreaks was submitted regularly every month to the American Consul General. 61. Other contagious diseases.15 increase of 259,239 over the previous year's figure 316,772. The work was undertaken in 649 outbreaks against 784 in the year 1934-35 and altogether 240 deaths were recorded among the inoculated number showing a percentage of 04. In addi- tion, 80 equities were also protected with anti-anthrax serum and anthrax spore vaccine. 64. Owing to a very large number of animals protected with goat tissue virus the local bodies received further relief in (meeting) the cost of inoculations and as such no special difficulties arose on the score of funds during the year. As is evident, the average cost per inoculation further decreased from Re. 0-1-9 to Re. 0-1-3. 65. Of the total number 184,981 inoculations were per- formed in the North Bihar Range, 236,563 in the Central and 154,550 in the Orissa Range. The details of the work accord- ing to each district and disease are shown in Table III. 66. Rinderpest.16 in the Orissa Range. Taking the case of particular districts, Gaya again stands first with 41,563 inoculations, Darbhanga second with 37,100 and Shahabad third with 30,312. In the Orissa Range the greatest number 22,081 were protected in Ranchi, and next to that 22,001 were done in Angul. It is also a noteworthy feature that the total number included 36,837 buffaloes of which 15,005 were protected in the North Bihar Range and 21,832 in the Central. The (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer's work under this head consisted entirely in experiments and will be mentioned in its proper place. 68. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.17 total sum of Rs. 57,537-5-5 due to the Muktesar Institute, a sum of Rs. 34,284-3-4 was recovered from the local bodies and other customers and credited to Government, leaving a balance of Rs. 23,253-2-1 outstanding on the 1st April 1936. The total realisations included the Government grant of Rs. 2,076-3-0 which was made to the District Board of Hazaribagh. Taking into account all supplies made up to the 31st March 1936, a sum of Rs. 19,596-5-3 remained due from the local bodies at the end of the year. Number of Animals Treated. 72. It has been pointed out more than once in the pages of the annual report of the department and elsewhere that further success is impossible to attain unless the subordinate staff is sufficiently strengthened. It was hoped that the local authorities would come forward in a body for at least one more touring veterinary assistant surgeon for their respective districts in consideration of the relief given in the cost of serum but if the experience gained during the last two years is to be taken as a guide, prospects are not bright for any further increase. Only two District Boards, Patna and Cuttack have up to date accepted a post each for Bakhtiarpur and Cuttack sadr, in addition to the one of Tikari accepted by the District Board, Gaya, in the year 1934-35. That the department is rendering most valuable services to the raiyats needs no further demonstration. The working of the rural veterinary dispensaries together with the latest development of goat virus amply justifies the statement. Now that the new campaign of cattle-breeding operations is making further demands on the activities of the department, it is fully time the local authorities rose to the occasion and saw that their district veterinary work did not suffer to any serious extent. It is to be regretted that the District Board, Champaran, have not yet seen their way to the appointment of two more touring assistants although resolved to do so two years ago. The Assistant Director, Veterinary Services, Orissa, in his annual report for the Orissa Range has made a long complaint that his subordinate staff was most inadequate and that an immediate increase in the number of touring veterinary assistant surgeons is required for Puri, Balasore and Sambalpur. I entirely agree with the Assistant Director. 73. Work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.18 as compared with 364,831 patients treated in the year 1934-35 This shows a substantial increase of 78,180 patients. Of the total number 72,680 animals were treated for contagious diseases, 251,713 were treated for non-contagious diseases and the remainder 104,807 were castrations. According to ranges 136,539 patients were treated in North Bihar, 159,671 in the Central and 136,801 in Orissa Range. In addition, 9,435 old cases were treated, and in the Orissa Range, 39,911 foot and mouth disease patients were supplied with medicines. 74. Rural veterinary dispensaries.19 a more spacious site. During the year, the District Board, Shahabad, constructed two rooms and two sheds for the Barhampur and Bikramganj veterinary dispensaries, while the District Board, Gaya, built quarters for the touring veterinary assistant surgeon, Warsaliganj. Proposals for the construction of fresh veterinary dispensary buildings at Barh and Bihar according to type plans, were also approved by the District Board, Patna. 78. Number of patients treated.20 served by these bulls during the year. 4 casualties having occurred, the number at the end of the year was 37. The details of their distribution are shown in Table VIII. 82. Castration.21 85. 63 animals were vaccinated against Rinderpest by goat tissue (spleen) virus method and 18 animals were tested for immunity against Rinderpest with bull virus during the year. These inoculations were carried out by the Laboratory staff of the Veterinary College and the result was satisfactory. The (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer also carried out some experiments with goat tissue virus and an immunity test. The animals of the Farm were also inoculated against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Black Quarter as usual. 86. Supply of Breeding bulls.22 and bhusa (chaff) to the value of Rs. 24,620-4-3 as per Statement B, while the expenditure on cultivation during the year was 9,629-14-0. The supply of water for irrigating the farm land was quite inadequate as in previous years. 91. The pasteurisation plant and the two oil engines have been working fairly well. The Morris Light van, which was purchased in January 1934, for delivering milk in the Bankipore town, has also been working satisfactorily. The officer in charge of the Farm has submitted proposals for renewal of the Tractor and Ensilage Cutter which are now under consideration. For the local delivery of milk, a Milk Delivery Cycle has recently been sanctioned. 92. Revenue and Expenditure.23 in villages. His Excellency Sir J. D. Sifton, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., I.C.S., Governor of the Province visited the section, while the Hon'ble Sir Courtney Terrell, Kt., Chief Justice of the Patna High Court, the Hon'ble Mr. S. A. Aziz, Bar.-at-Law, the Minister of Education, Bihar and Orissa, the Hon'ble Sir Ganesh Dutta Singh, Minister of Local Self-Government, Bihar and Orissa and Mr. R. E. Swanzy, I.C.S., the then Collector of Patna were among the distinguished visitors of the province. 95. At the 21 important horse and cattle fairs and shows held in the Province, 248,834 animals were brought for sale, as compared with 259,954 of the previous year. The Madhubani fair was not held due to an apprehension of Cholera breaking out. The health of the animals was, on the whole, satisfactory and the demand as well as average prices were almost the same as in the previous year. The details of the animals etc., are shown in Tables XIII and XIV. 96. As reported by the District Traffic Superintendent, Bengal and North-Western Railway Co., Ltd., 3,902 bullocks, 157 buffaloes and 237 cows, or a total of 4,298 animals were booked by rail to different places from stations on Sonepur district of the said Railway. CHAPTER V. Establishment. Provincial. 97. The same three officers Messrs. Malik, Sen and Chattarji constituted the personnel of the superior staff. In view of the transfer of Mr. Chattarji to the new Province of Orissa, Veteri- nary Inspector Babu P. C. Bhattacharji was promoted to the rank of Assistant Director in class II Service for the newly created Chota Nagpur sub-range from the 1st April 1936. Subordinate. 98. The same 13 veterinary inspectors continued as in the year 1934-35. During the year arrangements were completed for the trans- fer of 25 officers comprising 2 veterinary inspectors, 1 laboratory assistant, 1 staff veterinary assistant surgeon, 2 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 19 district veterinary assistant surgeons, most of them Oriyas, to the Province of Orissa with effect from 1st April 1936. Babu R. K. Ram, veterinary inspector, Chaibassa circle, was transferred to the North Bihar Range, vice
24 Babu M. M. Banarji. Inspector, Babu S. R. Bagchi continued to be on long leave and reserve veterinary assistant surgeon Maulavi S. B. Ahmad officiated in his place. 99. During the year, 2 veterinary assistant surgeons were dismissed and 1 resigned, while 3 new posts were filled up. Thus, at the end of the year, the subordinate staff consisted of 13 veterinary inspectors, 6 staff veterinary assistant surgeons, 2 laboratory assistants, 12 reserve veterinary assistant surgeons and 126 district veterinary assistant surgeons (31 stationary and 95 touring), there being, therefore, no change in the total number of subordinate officers, vide Table VII. CHAPTER VI. Laboratories. 100. There was no change in the three existing laboratories at Muzaffarpur, Patna Veterinary College and Cuttack where the diagnostic work for the three Ranges as well as at the college was generally carried out. The (Veterinary) Disease Investigation Officer also did some work at his own laboratory. 101. Altogether 1,178 smears including blood, faeces, pus, urine, etc., were received at the above three laboratories and on examination of same, diseases were diagnosed in 763 instances as follows :25 103. During the year Mr. Sahai undertook some interesting experiments in connection with rinderpest, viz., (1) viability of goat tissue virus in rinderpest, (2) duration of immunity conferred by goat blood-virus and tissue virus and (3) duration of immunity conferred by the " serum simultaneous" method of inoculation. In addition, he carried out a re-test of the herd comprising 34 animals of the Hazaribagh Central Jail for Johne's Disease with human and avian tuberculins, which produced entirely negative results, treated the same herd with carbon tetrachloride for fluke disease (Distomatosis or Facioliasis), investigated suspected bovine contagious abortion cases in the herd of the Darbhanga Goshala (Pinjrapole), Calcutta sore or Hump sore in some animals which arrived at Jamshedpur from Mysore via Calcutta, Coccidiosis in calves, sterility and abortion in cattle at some Government farms for information of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, a case of Kumri among the Mounted Military Police horses at Jamshed- pur, he carried out further investigation of Doyle's Disease (Fowl disease) in the districts of Singhbhum and Santal Parganas and collected several parasites. He also made a preliminary trial with the (Burma) Anthrax Spore Vaccine on two country-bred ekka ponies. As this proved satisfactory, he next protected the two troops of the Mounted Military Police at Jamshedpur comprising 24 and 28 animals respectively with the same vaccine at different times. Enquiries were also made by Mr. Sahai into the existence of warble flies required by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. 104. Investigation and experimental treatment carried out in Ranges.26 investigation scheme was spent from the Provincial Revenues, while the balance Rs. 2,74,384-6-1 was met from the local fund, against Rs. 4,21,684-11-5 and Rs. 2,55,382-7-7 respectively, spent from the same two sources in the year 1934-35. The apparent increase in the expenditure under the head " Provincial" was mainly due to the cost of serum having been, in the first instance, debited to the departmental budget and to periodical increments in pay. The details are shown in Table XIV(a). 106. The percentage of expenditure by Government for the department compared with total Provincial Revenues as per revised budget amounted to about 70 against .62 of the previous year. The total receipts of the department amounted to Rs. 1,73,459-8-9 compared with Rs. 1,21,048-14-5 in 1934-35. The increase was due to crediting the recoveries on account of the cost of sera and vaccines. CHAPTER VIII. General Remarks. 107. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.27 110.

GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR. (MINISTRY OF EDUCATION.) No. 2665-D. RESOLUTION. The 18th November 1936. READ2 3. The number of veterinary hospitals remained stationary at 38 but the number of patients treated showed a further increase from 93,587 in 1934-35 to 99,326. This indicates that their popularity is steadily increasing. It is also an encouraging sign that field veterinary dispensaries which have been in existence for only 4 years are making rapid progress. Their number increased from 139 in 1934-35 to 144, and 151,704 animals were treated against 123,075 in the preceding year. In last year's resolution the attention of local bodies was drawn to the necessity of an increase in the staff of touring veterinary assistant surgeons, if out- breaks of epidemic diseases are to be properly attended to It is hoped that suitable action will be taken without delay. 4. The working of the Patna Cattle Breeding and Dairy Farm showed further improvement over last year. The average milk yield per cow increased from 9.8 lbs. to 10.8 lbs. while the total milk yield increased from 391,000 lbs. to 431,008 lbs. The total quantity of milk sold was 400,582 lbs. against 357,000 lbs. in 1934-35. In addition 615 lbs. of cream and 132 lbs. of ghee were sold against 531 lbs. and 348 lbs. respectively, in 1934-35. The average number of cows in milk during the year was 112 against 111 in 1934-35. The total revenue including estimated receipts on account of fodder produced was Rs. 63,378 as against Rs. 60,789 in 1934-35 while the total expenditure also increased from Rs. 52,166 to Rs. 53,520. For the irrigation of fodder crops the farm is now being allowed the use of the tube well in the camp jail for a period of 4 months in a year, and it is hoped that this will go a long way to overcome the existing difficulties in regard to irrigation. 5. In the Veterinary College the total number of students increased from 52 in 1933-34 and 56 in 1934-35 to 71 in the year under report. The number of new admissions was 36 against 25 in 1934-35 and 24 in 1933-34. The college, however, attracted very few new students from the province, their num- ber being only 3 out of 36. The results of the examinations were satisfactory. The expenditure under the different heads was Rs. 78,947 against Rs. 76,422 in the preceding year. The veterinary hospital attached to the college treated 3,824 animals in 1935-36 as against 3,673 in 1934-35. Government are pleased to note that there has been a marked improvement in the working of the Research Laboratory and that the results during the year were satisfactory. Riding classes have now been introduced in the college for the benefit of the public,
3 6. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals employed two additional inspectors during the year under report, their number being raised from six to eight. The jurisdiction of these inspectors was extended to 33 munici- palities and 13 union boards. Altogether 3,083 cases were either reported or prosecuted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and out of them 2,598 ended in conviction; propaganda for the amelioration of the condition of animals was continued and 6,398 lectures on various veterinary subjects were delivered by the staff of the Civil Veterinary Department at important gatherings such as fairs and shows, village markets and middle schools. His Excellency the Viceroy's appeal for improved cattle breeding while increasing the work of the department will, it is hoped, bring the public more closely into touch with its activities. Schemes in this connection are under consideration. 7. Government are pleased to note the names of the officers commended by the Director for good work and their thanks arc due to Major Riley for the efficient administration of the Department. ORDER.
