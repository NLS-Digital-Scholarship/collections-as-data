In these regulations- (1) "Vessel" includes anything made for the conve- yance by water of human beings or of property. (2) "Port officer" includes any person  acting under the authority of Government in charge of port discipline. (3) "Master" when used in   relation to any vessel, means any person (except a pilot or harbour master) having for the time being the charge or control of the vessel. (4) "Sanitary authority" means,  as regards the port of Madras, the President of the Municipal Commission and, as regards other ports, the Collector of the district in which the port is situated. The jurisdiction of every sanitary authority shall, for the purposes of these regu- lations, extend to seaward for a distance of three miles beyond low water mark on all parts of the coast line bounding the area ordinarily under its jurisdiction. (5) "Port health officer" includes any duly  qualified medical practitioner appointed by a sanitary authority or by the local government to act in the execution of these regulations. (6) "Observation"   means    segregation   either    on board a vessel, or in an isolation camp or other place.

(8)  "Infected" used with reference to a vessel denotes any vessel with plague on board, or on board which one or more cases have taken place within twelve days. (9)  "Suspected"   used  with  reference   to  a   vessel denotes any vessel on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure, or during the voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for twelve days. (10) "Healthy" used with reference to a vessel denotes any vessel which has come from, or which during the voyage has touched at, an infected port, but which has had no death, or case of plague on board, either before depar- ture, during the voyage, or on arrival. 2.  The  master   of   every   "infected,"   "suspected,"   or "healthy" vessel or of every vessel which has been in com- munication otherwise than orally or by signal with a vessel from an infected port,   shall, when within three miles of the coast of any part of the Madras presidency, cause to be hoisted at the foremast head the commercial code flag Q being a yellow flag, and shall keep the   same   displayed during the   whole time between sunrise and sunset. If any vessel be infected in the sense of regulation 1 (8), the master shall also hoist the commercial code flag R below the yellow flag   Q.    Any such  vessel   arriving at  a   port   after   dark   shall  hoist   on coming to  an anchor one white light at  the foremast head and one red light at the mainmast head. 3.  The master of any such vessel shall,   before arriving at an anchorage, pump out the bilge water,  if possible after disinfection, and pass fresh sea water over the parts that have been in contact with  the bilge water.    The bilge water shall not be discharged within port limits. No tindal or other person in charge of, or navigating, any registered boat shall attempt to make such boat fast to, or shall take it alongside of, a vessel detained under these regu- lations or coming from an infected port, until such vessel has been granted pratique by the health officer of the port. 4.  The port officer, on the arrival of any vessel displaying the flag or flags or light or lights aforesaid, or if he ascertains from the master of such vessel, or  otherwise has reason to B
10           [Inward-bound regulation 5. believe that the vessel is "infected," "suspected," or "healthy" shall detain such vessel, and order the master forthwith to moor or anchor the same in such place as may be fixed by him; and the master shall moor or anchor accordingly. Provided that in the case of any vessel which has not communicated with the shore, the master, if he objects to submit to the obligations imposed by these regulations, shall be free to put back to sea. In such case, the port officer shall send immediate information to the sanitary authorities of the port to which the vessel is bound or at which she is next about to call. 5.  While a vessel shall be so detained, no person shall leave the same. 6.  The port officer, on the approach to the port of any vessel displaying the flag or flags or light or lights aforesaid, or on his detaining any vessel as aforesaid, shall forthwith give notice thereof and of the cause of such detention to the sanitary authority of the port, and also to the port health officer. 7.  The  detention  by the port officer of  a vessel  under regulation 4 shall cease as soon as the vessel shall have been, as hereinafter provided, duly visited and examined  by the port health officer, or, if the vessel shall, upon such examination, be found to be "infected" or  "suspected,"  as soon as  the same shall be  moored or anchored in pursuance of regulation 12. 8.  The sanitary authority shall, as speedily as practicable, with the approval of the port officer, fix some place where vessels may be moored or anchored for the purpose of regulation 12 and shall make provision for the reception of plague patients and other persons removed from vessels under these regulations.    The place to be fixed as aforesaid, where any vessel may be moored or anchored for the purpose of regulation 12, shall be some place within the jurisdiction of the sanitary  authority,   unless the local   government otherwise orders, in which case the place so fixed shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be deemed to be within such jurisdiction. 9.  On receiving the notice prescribed   by regulation 6, the port health officer shall forthwith visit and examine the vessel in regard to which such notice shall have been given, for  the purpose of ascertaining whether she is  "infected," "suspected," or "healthy."    He shall also do so, if he have reason to  believe that any vessel which has  arrived  or is within the jurisdiction of the sanitary authority,   whether
11 Inward-bound regulation 10.] 11 detained by tlie port officer or not, is "infected" or "suspected" or has come from, or touched at, a port where plague prevails or has passengers or crew on board who have been within an infected area within the preceding ten days. The master of such vessel shall permit it to be so visited and examined, and shall afford all reasonable facilities for such examination as the port health officer may deem requisite. 10.  For the purpose of ascertaining the state of the vessel as aforesaid, the port  health officer may demand from the doctor of the vessel or, failing him, from the master a declaration on oath whether there has been or has not  been a case of plague on the vessel since her departure, or whether any person suffering from, or suspected to  be suffering from, the plague has left or been removed from the vessel prior to or during the  voyage, and all particulars relative to any such circumstance; and the doctor or the master, as the case may be, shall be bound to make a true declaration to the best of his knowledge and belief.     If there are on board passengers or crew who have within the preceding ten  days been in an infected area,  the master of the vessel shall be bound to transmit duplicates of   passports to the   port health officer with his bill of health and to permit  that officer to  inspect special members of the crew and passengers concerned. 11.  When the port health officer has made such examination as aforesaid, he shall forthwith give a certificate in duplicate in the appended form [Appendix A], or to the like effect, and shall deliver one copy to the master and transmit the other to the sanitary authority.    He shall also, if the vessel is "infected" or  "suspected," give immediate   information of the fact to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras. 12.  The master of any vessel certified by the port health officer to be  "infected"  or "suspected"   shall  thereupon moor or anchor her, if he has not already done so, at the place fixed for that purpose under regulation 8 where she shall remain until the requirements of these regulations have been  duly fulfilled,   and from which   she   shall  not depart without the written or, where communication with the vessel is impracticable  owing to  stress of weather,   the   signalled permission of the port health officer. 13.  No person shall leave any such vessel until the exam-ination hereinafter prescribed shall have been made. 14.   (1) The port health officer shall, as soon as possible, after a vessel has been certified as "infected,"  "suspected," or "healthy", examine every person on board the same.
12 [Inward-bound regulation 14. (2)  If the vessel is certified to be "infected" and if any person on board such vessel is found to be suffering from plague   or  from  any  illness  which  the  port health   officer suspects   may   prove to  be plague,  the   port health officer shall certify accordingly.    Every   person   who   shall   be   so certified by him shall, if possible,  be disembarked, and shall be detained for treatment in a suitable hospital or isolation camp, or other place. (3)  Every person who shall not be so certified by him and who is bound for the port at which the vessel is lying shall be permitted to land immediately on giving to the port health officer his name and place of destination, stating his address at such place and on accepting a passport in accordance   with    regulation   1    of    rnufassal   plague   regulations under the Epidemic Diseases Act,   1897, for district municipalities and other towns and villages, or of regulation 1 of regulations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, for the City of Madras, as the case may be; provided that the port health officer may, should he   feel   doubt as  to the trustworthiness of any person, or should he consider any person in any way likely to carry the infection  of the plague, cause him to be disembarked and detain him under observation in an isolation camp or other place;  provided also that in the case   of   such  respectable persons  as may be relied on to report promptly, if they fall sick, the port health officer may at his  option relax the regulations so far as to exempt them from the necessity of making a daily visit to the local plague authorities, such exemption being endorsed on their passports and counterfoils. (4) All other persons remaining on board the vessel (except those referred to in regulation 17 who are subject to the restrictions therein specified) shall be placed under surveillance during the time the vessel is in port and shall not be allowed to land without the written permission of the port health officer. (5)  The  maximum   period   of detention of  persons, arriving by an "infected" vessel,  kept under observation outside a camp shall be ten days from the date of leaving the vessel; or in the  case of persons placed in a camp   ten days from the date of the occurrence of the last case' of plague in such camp, or, if no such case occurs, ten days from the date of leaving the ship. (6)  If the vessel is certified  to  be   "suspected" or "healthy," all persons on board who may disembark shall be subjected to surveillance at their destination, in the case of a
?Inward-bound regulation 15.]        13 "suspected " vessel for a period of ten days from the date of  arrival of the vessel in port, and in the case of a " healthy"  vessel for the period necessary to complete a term of ten days  from the date of the vessel's departure from the infected port  last visited. In either case the port health officer may place  under observation instead of surveillance, for the above- mentioned terms, any person whom he may consider to be  untrustworthy or in any way likely to carry the infection of  the plague. Those under surveillance shall be subject to the  passport rules referred to in clause (3) above, and those under  observation shall be detained in an isolation camp or other  place; provided that in the case of such respectable persons  as may be relied on to report promptly, if they fall sick,  the port health officer may at his option relax the regulations  so far as to exempt them from the necessity of making a  daily visit to the local plague authorities, such exemption  being endorsed on their passports and counterfoils.   (7) Any person detained under observation or placed  under surveillance who is certified by the port health officer or  by the medical officer appointed for the purpose to be suffering  from plague or from any illness which such officer suspects  may prove to be plague, may be taken to such hospital or  isolation camp as may be appointed for that purpose by the  sanitary authority of the port or place, or to other place and  detained there until his recovery, or for such period not  exceeding ten days, as may be necessary for ascertaining  whether his illness is or is not plague. The said person shall  be bound to remain in the place where he is detained and to  follow such instructions as the sanitary authority may  prescribe. (8) In the case of vessels which are not "infected,"  "suspected," or " healthy," but have on board any passengers  or members of the crew who have been within an infected  area during the preceding ten days, the port health officer  shall, when the destination of the passenger or the port of  visit of the crew is within the Madras presidency, issue a  passport to each individual concerned, if one be not already in  his possession, and advise the fact to the next port health  officer by the quickest safe method. * Vide regulations 3, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 and 21.   15. (i) As soon as the master of an " infected " vessel  has complied with  the requirements and directions of the port health officer as provided in these  regulations,* the port health officer  shall grant him a certificate in the appended form [Appendix B], and thereupon the vessel shall
14 [Inward-bound regulation 16. have all the privileges of a   "healthy"   vessel in  the port concerned. (ii) Provided that, if a case of plague or of illness suspected to be plague, occurs on board subsequent to the grant of the above certificate, the certificate shall become invalid and the vessel again become subject to the requirements of the regulations regarding "infected" vessels. * Vide regulations 3, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 and 21. (iii) In the case of a "suspected" or "healthy" vessel, free pratique shall be granted at once, provided, in the case of ports of arrival which are healthy, the requirements * of these regulations have been complied with, and in the case of ports of arrival which are infected, the persons who may disembark are subjected to surveillance. (iv) Such precautions shall be taken at healthy ports in the case of "healthy," "suspected," or "infected" vessels in regard to communication with the vessel or the landing of cargo, mails, passengers or crew as may be prescribed by Government or as may be considered by the port health officer to be necessary. 16.  No person detained for treatment or  placed under observation shall leave the camp or place or vessel in which he is detained under treatment or observation, until the chief medical  officer present at the spot shall have certified that such person is free from the infection of the plague. 17.  If any person suffering from plague or from any illness which the port health officer suspects may prove to be plague cannot be disembarked under   regulation 14, he may be detained on board the vessel, which  shall remain  subject, for the purpose of this regulation, to the  control of the port health officer.    Such person  shall not be removed from  or leave the vessel, except with the consent, in writing, of the port health officer, and if the illness from which such person suffered is, or proves to be plague, the vessel should be treated as an "infected" vessel. 18.  The port  health officer  shall, in  the case of every vessel certified to be "infected" or "suspected," give directions for the disinfection of all parts of the vessel which have been inhabited by plague patients and he may also give such other directions   for the  more thorough   disinfection of the vessel as may appear to him to  be  necessary  for preventing the spread of infection.    The master of the said vessel shall forthwith carry into execution all such directions.

In   the   event of any death  from  plague on  board such   vessel,  the   master shall, as directed by the  sanitary authority, or the port health officer, either  cause the dead body to be taken out to sea and   committed to the deep properly loaded to prevent its rising, or shall deliver it into the charge of the sanitary authority for disposal, if the former procedure be not in accordance with caste or race customs. 20.  The master shall cause to be destroyed any articles on board his vessel that may have been soiled with plague discharges and he shall also cause to be disinfected or destroyed the clothing and bedding and  other  articles of personal use likely to retain infection which are on board his vessel, and which   have been used   by   any   person  who   has  suffered from plague on  board such vessel or who  having left   such vessel, shall have  suffered from plague during the stay   of such vessel in   the   port,   and   all  such  articles   as,  in   the opinion   of    the   port health   officer,  may   be   regarded   as contaminated.      In   the   case   of   "infected"   vessels   the personal   baggage   of both    crew   and   passengers   shall  be disinfected without   exception.     If   the   master   shall   have neglected to carry out these  precautions or have done so ineffectually, he shall  forthwith, upon the  direction  of the sanitary authority or the port health officer, cause  the same to be disinfected   or  destroyed   to  the   satisfaction   of that authority, and in accordance with the instructions as  to disinfection  contained  in  the circular issued  by  the  Sanitary Commissioner.    If the  said master  neglect to comply with any such  directions within a reasonable  time, the sanitary authority or the port health officer shall cause  the  same to be carried into execution at the expense of the said vessel. 21.  Provided facilities exist for obtaining suitable water in the port, the master shall, on the direction of the port health officer, cause all   tanks   in   an "infected" or "suspected" vessel to be completely emptied and cleaned and disinfected in such manner as the port health officer may direct and fresh water to be taken in.    The port health officer may also, if he thinks   necessary,   give like   directions in the   case of a "healthy" vessel.    The master of the vessel shall forthwith carry any such direction into execution. a 22.
