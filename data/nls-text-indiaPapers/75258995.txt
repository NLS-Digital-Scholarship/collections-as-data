ORIGINAL ARTICLES SOME STUDIES ON THE APPLICATION OF THE FREEZING POINT TEST TO BUFFALO'S AND COW'S MILK IN INDIA BY ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA J. S. BHALLA AND N. D. LAVANGIA Imperial Dairy Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 16 October 1941) INTRODUCTION THE great utility of the freezing point test in dealing with milk samples sus- pected of carrying added water has been fairly well established in recent years. It provides a simple and reliable method for detecting the presence of added water in milk. The present milk legislation in most municipalities and provinces in India is based mainly on the determination of fat and solids-not- fat but these values vary considerably under the prevailing conditions of milk production and handling. The formulation of a common standard for milk for the whole of the country presents special difficulties, as there are two types of milch cattle in India, viz. the cow and the buffalo. Thus it is necessary to fix these values for at least three classes of milk, viz. the cow's milk, the buffalo's milk and mixed milk, all of which show marked differences in their composition. Again the normal daily variation, as well as variations due to such factors as breed, individuality, stage of lactation, etc. tend to be more conspicuous under Indian conditions, due to the fact that in the vast majority of cases the milk is collected from a very small number of animals and no special care is taken to bulk the supply properly. Under these circumstances it was felt that if the freezing point test could be standardized under Indian conditions it would prove of particular value to health authorities in exercising a more efficient control over the milk supply of the place. With this end in view this method of detecting adulteration in milk was examined systematically. In recent years a number of countries have adopted this method as a standard test for the detection of added water in milk. It is also significant that in countries where this method has been officially adopted, the number of cases of adulteration has shown a remarkable drop. A similar step in this country should go far in helping the public health authorities to fight the evil of adulteration, which is very widespread. It is not likely that the freezing point of genuine cow's or buffalo's milk will show any marked difference but still it was considered desirable to confirm this assump- tion. So far no work has been done to test the suitability of this method for Indian conditions except for some data obtained by Leather [1914] by a few trials with it. 1

Thus, the actual figures obtained are nearest to those calculated from Leather's tables. From this it can be concluded that, provided a margin of about two to three per cent added water is allowed, the formulae given by Winter and Leather can be employed for samples of buffalo's milk. It will thus be seen that the freezing point determination offers the best way to check samples of buffalo's milk adulterated with water and sold as cow's milk. While the solids-not-fat and fat content in such a case may be found normal for cow's milk, the freezing point test will not fail to detect such adulteration.

LAVANGIA 11 Eighty-five determinations were made on samples of buffalo's milk adul- terated with 5, 10, 20 and 50 per cent water, in order to determine to what extent adulteration percentage calculated by various methods from the freez- ing'point of watered samples agreed with the true figure. The percentage of added water was calculated by employing the formula of Hortvet [1921], both by using the actual value obtained for unwatered and watered samples and by taking the freezing point of unwatered milk as THE BLOOD GROUPS OF INDIAN CATTLE AND BUFFALOES BY BALWANT SINGH, G.P.V.C. Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 4 February 1942) FROM present day knowledge of anthropology, genetics and immunology, it is well established that certain natural antibodies are formed in the system of animals, apart from environmental stimulus and in accordance with definite genetical laws. Isohaemagglutinins, by which mankind can be divided into different blood-groups, provide an example of such natural antibodies. Landsteiner [1901] was the first to distinguish the principal blood-groups and he showed that this grouping depends, in the main, on the distribution of two different antigenic constituents, which may be present together or separately or may both be ab- sent. There are two corresponding antibodies and these are so distributed that neither of them is present in the blood of an individual whose red cells contain the corresponding antigen. Two classifications of these four main blood-groups have been adopted in diffe- rent countries, those of Jansky [1908] and of Moss [1910]. The former has been adopted in India by Greval [1940] and will be followed in this work. The constituent factors of these groups are set out as follows :BALWANT SINGH 13 According to Szymanowski [1934], investigations upon isoagglutination in animals are much more difficult than in man, because the affinity of blood corpuscles and their corresponding agglutinins is much less developed. The result is that, if agglutination occurs at all, it is much slower and less pronounced than in man. The influence of tem- perature on the reaction is also more marked. Little [1929] discussed the irregularities in the isoagglutination of the blood of bovines and observed that in cattle changes in respect of isoagglutination occur frequently without any definite reason. In the absence of experimental data, the possibility that the nutritive condition of an animal may be a factor in this occasional variation in the constituents might well repay investigation. Another factor, which makes research still more difficult, is the lack of physiological agglutinins corresponding to the group characteristic of a given individual. Finally, there is an uneven quantitative relationship between the two principal characteristics. As a result of this, it often seems, especially at the beginning of an investigation, that there is only one group. In livestock, especially among the more domesticated breeds, many animals do not fit into a general scheme, a large prercentage of them being excluded on account of the agglutination of corpuscles by the serum of their own group. This creates a large field for individual interpretation and makes the result dependent upon the precision with which the experiment is performed. The differentiation of blood groups in animals of different species has been carried out in other countiries. Thus, there is close relationship between anthropoid apes and man. In chimpanzees, group A is predominent, followed by O and B ; in the orang- outang, the groupings are A, B or AB ; in the gorilla, A alone ; in the gibbon, B group- ing alone has been found. Oldworld monkeys have corpuscles which do not react with human sera A and B, but the monkeys of the new world and also some lemurs react with serum anti-B. Dogs show a lack of physiological isoagglutinins but their appearance can be produced by cross-immunization with the corpuscles of other dogs. Lauer [1930] states that canine sera agglutinated human group O corpuscles, while human group AB sera agglutinated canine blood corpuscles. Kaempffer [1932] carried out extensive work on blood-groups in pigs and was able to establish four groups viz. O, A, B, and AB. A small percentage of pigs was anomalous. Ottenberg and Friedman [1911] reported the presence of group isoagglutinins in steers and rabbits. Extensive work on the existence and classification of blood-groups in horses has been carried out. Walsh [1924] studied the inter-relationship of horses, asses and mules by means of isoagglutination and concluded that a high proportion of samples of ass serum agglutinates the erythrocytes of horses but does not agglutinate the corpuscles of the mule. Schermer et al. [1932] carried out work on the blood-groups of equines, with special reference to hereditary factors. They confirmed the existence of four groups, as well as of ' accessory ' groups. Anderson [1932] records four blood-groups in horses and suggests the possibility of differentiating breeds by blood-group reactions. Burghardt [1933] classified various breeds of horses into four groups, similar to those found in man. Fourie [1935] studied blood-groups in horses with special reference to blood transfusion. Reeser [1938] in 64 per cent of horses found the agglutinin factor for group AB of man. Herman [1936] found a resemblance between the blood groups of men and horses. He suggests blood transfusion in horses for therapeutic purposes. Thomoff [1930] also demonstrated four groups in horses. He states that the agglutinogens in their manner of working do not appear to differ from those of man but that isoagglutinins are present in lower titre. Investigations on the isoagglutinins of cattle are, according to Schermer [1934], very difficult, as their serum rarely contains isoagglutinins. Hofferber and Winter [1932] studied the blood groups of bovines in America and Germany and classified animals in groups O, A and B ; they did not observe the structure, AB. Important work on the isoagglutinins of bovines was carried out by Little [1929]. This author used 209 cows and 31 bulls in his experiments and classified them into the following three groups :14 The Blood Groups of Indian Cattle and Buffaloes Usuelli [1931], in studying the blood groups of Bos taurus, found that group Ao and Oa occurred almost exclusively in animals descendant from the Podolian breed while Swiss and Holstein breeds belonged to group Oo, with the exception of a few Swiss cattle of group Ao. Karshner [1928] found isoagglutinins in the blood of bovines but states that they are less common than in the blood of man. Reactions are less frequent among bovine animals of the same strain than among those of widely divergent strains. Schermer [1932] states that there appears to be a difference of opinion as to whether cattle have three or four groups. The problem of differentiating the various breeds of cattle in India and of deciding whether particular animals ought to constitute ' breeds' or merely ' local varieties' is one which has exercised many minds. Until a few years ago there was considerable disagreement on these matters among persons qualified to express an opinion ; even now it cannot be said that complete agreement has been reached, while the criteria that are used for classi- fication are largely physical or morphological. The issues have now been considerably clarified, thanks to the observation of Olver [1938] and Ware [1939, 1941], working through the medium of the Imperial Council of Agri- cultural Research. No previous work has been carried out in this country on the grouping of bovine bloods. By doing so now, it was hoped that some light might be thrown on the origin and relationship of Indian cattle. It was necessary, however, to determine in the first place whether blood groupings can be accurately distinguished. The first experiments were, therefore, conducted on cattle of the Hariana breed, a few Kumauni hill bulls, Dhanni bullocks and on buffaloes, such as were available on the farm of this Institute. A few samples of sera and corpuscles were also available from other cattle breeds. Finally, a considerable number of Hariana cattle at the Govern- ment Cattle Farm at Hissar were tested. METHODS In view of the findings of Hopp [1920], according to which the blood- groups in children are only established after one year of age, adult animals only were used in these experiments. The technique for studying isoagglu- tinins in human practice has been fully worked out but in veterinary science much further work remains to be accomplished. At first, the slide and plate methods, originally adopted by Moss, Lee and Vincent, quoted by Lauer [1930], were used but those proved to be entirely unsatisfactory with cattle. We have, therefore, used the tube method, in which a certain quantity (say four drops) of serum is poured into small test tubes (size 7 cm. × 1 cm.) and an equal quantity of 2 per cent corpuscle suspension added. The mixture is then gently shaken and placed in a dry incubator at 37°C. Serum was taken from the clot, and corpuscles by drawing blood into small bottles containing 2.5 per cent. sodium citrate in salineBALWANT SINGH 15 When the reaction is positive, the cells form clumps which may float in the liquid, may settle as granular masses or may adhere to the bottom from which they can only be separated by rigorous shaking. Cases where there is granulation but with disappearance of the clumps on shaking were recorded as negative.

Isoagglutination was complete after 20-40 minutes. A number of strongly reacting sera and cells were examined for the presence of a prozone phenomenon but this was not observed, while at the same time it appeared that positive reactions were to be expected with serum dilutions of 1 : 2 or 1 : 4 but not higher.

It was also noticed that, in a large proportion of animals possessing both antigen and antibody, only one of the constituents was actively operating, while the other rarely exhibited any reaction. A few examples of such cases are described. (1) Buffalo 59.22 The Blood Groups of Indian Cattle and Buffaloes SUMMARY 1. The existence of blood groupings among Indian cattle and buffaloes has been determined. 2. Among 159 cattle, mostly of Hariana, Dhanni and Kumauni hill breeds, and 48 buffaloes, the percentage groupings were group I, 12.6 per cent ; group II, 23.7 per cent ; group III, 22.2 per cent ; group IV (negative), 41.5 per cent. For reasons explained in the text, this classification is tentative and needs to be extended and rendered more precise by the ex- amination of a sufficient number of cattle belonging to different breeds. 3. Technical points ascertained were as follows, (a)Washed corpuscles stored in the cold remain agglutinable for 21.28 days. (b) Serum kept in the cold remains agglutinative for about 48 hours. (c) Serum, which has deterio- rated during storage or by heating at 60°C., can sometimes be reactivated by the addition of fresh ox or guinea-pig serum. There is no evidence, however, that the reactivating agent is serum complement. (d) Owing to the usually weak agglutinin titres of cattle blood, the slide test as ordinarily conducted at room temperature with human blood cannot be used. To demonstrate reactions, equal parts of serum and 2 per cent red cell suspension should be mixed in tubes and kept at 37°C. for an hour or so.

(India) (Received for publication on 20 May 1941) (With two charts) THE utility of berseem as a fodder crop is being gradually appreciated and farmers have taken up cultivation of berseem to a certain extent. But little information is available about this crop. It is not possible to assess the maximum return of nutrients from a fodder crop unless the composition and the yield available during different stages of growth are known. While studying the effect of replacing concentrates by berseem for production values data for composition and yield of berseem as influenced by the stage of maturity have also been collected. In this paper figures obtained during 1939-40 for the composition of berseem only, as influenced by maturity, have been recorded. It is well known that composition of grasses vary with age. Newlander, Jones and Ellenberger [1933], while studying the effect of frequency of cutting upon the composition of grass, noticed that the protein percentages vary directly with the frequency of cuttings and the fibre contents varied exactly in the reverse order. Calcium, phosphate and ether extracts were greatest with younger grasses. Roy and Sen [1933] in their work with hill pasture at Mukteswar, 7,000 ft. above sea level, have observed that with the growth of the plants and increase of rainfall the percentage of lime and phosphorus increased to a maximum in September-October, and that after this period the amount of phosphate decreased considerably with the approach of winter and dry season. No marked decrease in the lime content was noticed. Ramiah [1933], while working with Spear grass (Andropogon contortus) has recorded that nitrogen and phosphoric acid curve followed a parallel course, while the calcium curve varied inversely with nitrogen and phosphoric acid. Paterson [1933] recorded definite increase in dry matter and crude fibre per- centages in elephant grass with mature foliage and a distinct fall in the per- centages of protein, silica free ash, calcium and phosphates. Iyer [1935] has shown that both crude protein and soluble ash decreased with increased maturity. According to Morrison [1936] forage plants at early stages of growth contain much more calcium on the dry basis than at the later stages. Lander [1937] observed that when left to attain maturity in the natural condition, the nutritive value of grass at Lyallpur progressively decreased in regard to protein and phosphoric acid content, while the calcium figure remained more or less steady. Louw [1938] also has made similar observa- tions. He found that crude protein, silica free ash and phosphates decreased with maturity, but no appreciable variations in calcium were noticed with the stages of growth of grasses. Fraps and Fudge [1940] also found that 30
N. C. DAS GUPTA 31 protein and phosphate decreased with advancing maturity of forage grasses while crude fibre and N. F. E. tended to increase. Changes in calcium were irregular. Results obtained in this laboratory with berseem indicate that the varia- tions due to maturity in the protein, silica free ash and phosphate contents are similar to those recorded by the above workers, but it has been observed that up to a certain stage of growth the percentage of calcium on dry basis in berseem gradually increases. In this respect it agrees with the findings of Roy and Sen [ loc. cit.] . Woodman, Evans and Norman [1933] also recorded a similar increase in the percentages of calcium with the increasing maturity of lucerne. In this connection it may be noted that Chandler [1939] working with foliage of forest trees also recorded that the calcium content increases throughout the growing season. PLAN OF EXPERIMENT Berseem was sown after jowar in a plot at Madhurikund Farm, Muttra, on October 29, 1939, the seed rate being sixteen pounds per acre. The first sample was taken on December 28, during the ninth week after sowing, when the average height was only 8 inches. Afterwards samples were taken during every week till the plants were in late bloom stage. Plants were cut close to the ground with a scythe during the middle of every week and one kilo- gram of the thoroughly mixed sample was taken for analysis. The samples were first dried in the sun before they were kept in oven for estimation of dry matter. The dried samples were analysed to find out the composition. During January, 8 to 14, 15 to 21 and 22 to 28 composite samples made up of daily cut berseem were taken to represent the 11th, 12th and 13th week respectively, as berseem was being harvested every day during this period for a feeding trial. The average height during each week was also recorded. This was obtained by dividing the total length of all the plants in a sample by the number of plants. While collecting the samples special care was taken to include only the original plants and avoid the fresh growth from previous samplings. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The organic constituents of berseem grown at Madhurikund have been recorded in Table I. The dry matter content, as expected, has increased with maturity, the range being 8.5 to 21.7 per cent. The lower figures during the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 20th weeks are either due to irrigation or humid atmosphere. There is a slight increase in the organic matter content up to the 15th week, after which it is constant till the 20th week and a gradual fall is noticeable afterwards. The Plot was irrigated on January 5, February 21, and March 28, 1940, while the amount of rain fall recorded on various dates was as given below : January 18 and 19 . . . . . . . . 1.0" January 27 . . . . . . . . . 0.25" February 2 and 3 . . . . . . . . 0.8" February 4 . . . . . . . . 0.5" C 2
32 Composition of Berseem The percentage of crude protein decreased with age, being 26.68 and 15.80 during the 9th and the 24th weeks respectively. The fall is rapid in the early stages. From the 17th week to the late bloom stage there is no appreciable variation in the protein content. Ether extract content also [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Chart I
N. C. DAS GUPTA 33 decreased gradually with growth. The fibre content on the other hand gradually increased with maturity from 14.85 to 28.4 per cent, an increase of about hundred per cent. The values for true protein are similar to crude protein. The proportion of amides in the crude protein is quite high during the early stages of berseem, the average amount being about 22 per cent of crude protein till the sixteenth week while the average percentage of amides is about 11 from seventeenth to twenty-fourth week. It appears that the quantity of amides also decreases rapidly after the 16th week. The data obtained during the 22nd week are abnormal and may be due to some in- accuracy in sampling.

Berseem is quite high in minerals containing on an average about 12.7 per cent silica free ash. The percentage of silica free ash varied from 14.55 in the early stage to 11.45 per cent after flowering, showing a gradual decrease in the mineral content with maturity. The lime content indicates a definite variation with growth. It has increased gradually from 2.08 per cent in the ninth week to 3.63 per cent during the eighteenth week, when a gradual fall is noticed. The phosphate,
N. C. DAS GUPTA 35 on the other hand, has decreased with maturity varying inversely with cal- cium . There is a gradual fall from 0.699 per cent in the ninth week to 0.400 per cent in the ninteenth week. A slight increase is being observed towards the later stage. The trend of variations in the mineral contents can be better studied from Chart II. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
36 Composition of Berseem It appears from Chart II that somewhere about the eighteenth week of growth a reversal of phase takes place with calcium and phosphate contents of berseem. There seems to be an inverse relationship between these two minerals during the first stage of growth and even during the later stage, and when the reversion takes place, the same relationship is noticed. It has been mentioned previously that both protein and ether extract contents, which gradually decrease with growth, also become more or less steady from the 18th week. This appears to be due to some physiological change in the plant which starts flowering at about this stage. The above observations have been recorded from only one plot of berseem at Madhurikund. The composition of a plant varies with different soil and climatic conditions. Further studies in this line are in progress at different farms in this province to study the effect of soil and climate on the present observations. SUMMARY A preliminary observation about the variations in the composition of berseem with progressive growth has been recorded. Proteins, ether extract, amides and silica free ash decreased with maturity of the berseem plant; fibre content on the other hand increased with advance in growth. Berseem is quite rich in mineral content, the percentage being as high as 14.55 in the early stage. Calcium and phosphate vary inversely. While calcium content increases gradually with growth, up to about the flowering stage, phosphate content decreases.

A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON THE INCIDENCE OF STRONGYLOIDES PAPILLOSUS WEDL, 1856 IN INDIA BY S. N. VAIDYANATHAN, G.M.V.C. Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Parasitology Section, Madras Veterinary College, Madras (Received for publication on 5 April 1941) (With Plate I and 10 text figures) INTRODUCTION THE genus Strongyloides Grassi, 1879, has an interesting feature among nematodes. Its members exhibit in their life-cycle, an alternating genera- tion of free-living and parasitic forms; the factors that contribute to cause this transformation have not been definitely determined. Amongst parasitic forms only females are known in all the species; the rarely found parasitic males are only in the case of Strongyloides of the dog and man. The free- living forms exhibit sexual differentiation. The parasitic forms occur in the intestine of vertebrates, the free-living stages in the faeces of the host or in the soil. During the course of routine examination of calf dung, in the Parasito- logy Section of the Madras Veterinary College, numerous ova considerably larger than oocysts of coccidia and much smaller than the more common strongyle ova were detected, varying in size from .044 to .052 mm. by .027 to .031 mm. In the fresh faeces, the eggs contained vermiform embryos. In the faecal culture of calves that revealed these eggs, the infective larvae of a Strongyloides species have been regularly seen. The cultures have shown, besides, the free-living forms (females only) of a Strongyloides species that agrees with the description given by Ransom [1911] for Strongyloides papillosus. No males could be detected. The post mortem examination of some of these bovines, whose faeces contained eggs of the species, has revealed numerous parasitic females of Strongyloides papillosus mixed up with the contents of the small intestine. Cultures of dung from sheep brought for slaughter at the Madras Slaughter House, have also shown the incidence of an infection with Strongy- loides. A study of the free-living forms developing in them reveal that they are identical with those met with in taurine faecal cultures. LITERATURE Important life-history investigations on the human species (Strongy- loides stercoralis Bavay, 1876) have been made during the last quarter of the nineteenth century indirectly leading to furthermore experimental studies of the present day. Quoting Faust [1937], from his review of the life-history of Strongyloides, " it has been frequently demonstrated, the fundamental, basic type of life-cycle of members of this genus involves an indirect mode of development, with alternation of a parasitic and a free-living phase...... The indirect mode of development undoubtedly precedes the direct mode in 37
38 Incidence of Strongyloides papillosus Wedl, 1856 the life-history of the genus. The latter has been developed for the con- servation of the species under conditions commonly obtaining in less favour- able milieu, as, for example, human strains in cooler climates. At the pre- sent time there is no evidence of a genetic distinction between indirect and direct modes of development in species of Strongyloides on which adequate clinical and experimental studies have been conducted ". Wedl [1856] discovered and named the common ovine species (S. papil- losus) ; Pagenstecher [1865] described a Strongyloides from pigs before Bavay [1876] described the human species of Strongyloides (S. stercoralis). Species of the genus Strongyloides have since been described from many groups of vertebratesS. N.

S. N. VAIDYANATHAN 41 THE PARASITIC GENERATION No infective experiments were conducted. Only females of the parasitic generation were recovered. They were mostly found in the first few feet of the small intestine of the host. Up to the present time males have not been found. It is interesting to note that the rare males, Kreis [1932] found in the freshly passed exudates of a human case and a dog infected by him with a human strain of Strongyloides stercoralis, are described as of the rhabditi- form type; perhaps further investigation may reveal them in the hosts of Strongyloides papillosus as well. THE PARASITIC FEMALE (Figures 7, 9, 11 and 12) It is long and filiform as all the parasitic adults of the genus. The cuticle bears fine striations which are resolvable only under an oil-immersion objective. Situated around the mouth are six papillae. The oesophagus is simple and almost cylindrical. There is no definite relationship between the total length of the worm and the length of the oesophagus ; it may roughly be said to vary from a seventh to a fifth of the worm. It is without a poste- rior swelling and contains well developed oesophageal glands. The tail is bluntly rounded and finger-shaped. The vulva, a transverse slit with rather salient lips, is situated posterior to the middle of the body which it divided approximately in the proportion of five to two. The gonad is double and is composed of an anterior and a posterior loop. Sandground [1925] draws attention to the disposition or course of the ovaries in the parasitic generation which affords a good diagnostic feature for certain species of Strongyloides and shows that they are twisted or simple hair-pin bends. In Strongyloides papillosus both the anterior and posterior loops of the ovary are twisted round the intestine which serves as the axis.

44 Incidence of Strongyloides papillosus Wedl, 1856 THE RHABDITIFORM (FREE-LIVING) MALE It could not be detected during the culture studies made with calf faeces. The free-living males are reported to be more common in faecal cultures of rabbits harbouring Strongyloides papillosus. Infection of rabbits is con- templated ; the one attempted failed. PATHOGENESIS Strongyloides papillosus occurs in cattle, sheep and goats, many wild ruminants and the rabbit. In sheep it is not considered very pathogenic, many being harboured without apparent ill-effects. In the mink, from which similar forms are recovered, heavy infections are found to cause serious trouble. During post mortem of a dozen calves counts varying from a few to a thousand-and-five-hundred of these worms, in the small intestine, have been detected. It should be possible in the tropics, for young stock to get very heavily infested with these worms. Few of the young calves escape being in- fected as findings show. Unthriftiness among calves is common and in the absence of other accountable causes, it may be useful to investigate if that could be attributed to parasitism by Strongyloides. IMMUNITY There seems to be an age immunity of cattle against Strongyloides judg- ing from the results of faecal examination of calves and full grown cattle. Sixty per cent of 150 young calves were found infested with Strongyloides papillosus; but no infection was observed in 400 adults aged two years and over. It appears that infected calves quickly cleanse themselves with the growing of age. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author is indebted to Rao Sahib M.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE PERMEABILITY OF THE GOAT'S PLACENTA TO RINDERPEST VIRUS BY M. K. SREENIVASAN, G.M.V.C. Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 11 September 1941) THERE is little in the relevant literature to suggest that the placenta is readily permeable to filterable viruses. In some virus diseases, e.g. rabies, it has been shown that infection can take place in utero. Thus Konradi [1916], from transmission experiments on guinea-pigs, draws the conclusion that rabies virus can be transmitted via the placenta but that, in serial experiments, virulence gradually diminishes. This appears to hold good also for dogs and other species of animals. Lanfranchi and Lenzi [1918] demonstrated that rabies virus, apparently unaltered in virulence, was present in the central nervous system of seven pups removed from a bitch that died of dumb rabies, all rabbits inoculated with spinal cord material from the bitch and the pups separately dying of typical rabies. This appears to show clearly that the virus had traversed the placental filter. Mrowka [1914] noted lesions, assumed to be those of rinderpest, in the abomasum of newly-born calves and surmised that the infection had been contracted in utero. He concluded that this might explain the insusceptibi- lity of Asiatic cattle to rinderpest. No experimental evidence, however, was given in support of this view. Edwards [1927] carried out a series of experiments in sheep with rinder- pest virus on lines similar to those undertaken in Germany by Beller and Tahssin Bey [1926] who found that, when cultures of bovine pleuro-pneumonia ' virus ' were injected into sheep, complement fixation tests with the blood serum indicated somewhat prolonged survival of the virus in some obscure situation in the body. Some pregnant sheep after infection in this way, aborted, and bacteriological and pathological examinations revealed that the virus had become established in tissues of some of the foetuses, setting up lesions closely resembling those of the natural disease in cattle, although no trace of infection could be found in the maternal tissues. In the experiments of Edwards [1927] pregnant sheep, inoculated with bovine rinderpest virus, were used. At prescribed intervals the sheep were killed, and the maternal blood and foetal juices and tissues tested separately for virulence by inoculation into susceptible hill bulls. It was found that the virus persisted in the maternal blood for some weeks after infection, but its persistence was irregular, and there was no evidence of its being established in the foetal tissues. The foetal envelopes thus appeared to be an effective barrier against the penetration of a possibly somewhat enfeebled virus into the foetal circula- tion. It may also be mentioned here that Banerji [1933] observed that the milk of cows, inoculated 5 to 10 days previously with rinderpest virus, was infective 45 D
46 Permeability of the Goat's Placenta given 10 c.c. subcutaneously, but it failed to infect when even 500 c. c. was given orally. Milk from animals infected with rinderpest ceased to be infec- tive from the 12th day after virus inoculation. Curasson [1921] observed that milk from cows hyper-immunized to rinderpest was protective, but was less active than blood serum from the same animals. Whey was less active than whole milk. Banerji and Mohan [1935] from a single transmission experiment conclud- ed that the placenta of the goat, and probably the placenta of ruminants in general, though possessing a relatively high degree of resistance to the passage through it of most substances, will permit the passage of a minute antigen such as the virus of rinderpest. In the simple experiments which form the subject of this paper a search for the virus was made in foetuses at various stages of development taken from goats suffering from rinderpest. The mother goats, from which the foetuses were obtained were typical cases of rinderpest, and the virus was propagated from every one of them. From 4 to 8 days after inoculation of the pregnant goats, foetuses apparently near term, were recovered, and their tissues exa- mined for the presence of virus. Hill bulls were usually employed as test animals in order to avoid any irregular thermal reactions such as is frequently met with in goats. The experimental bulls were later tested for susceptibi- lity, with virulent bull or goat blood, and all proved highly susceptible to rinderpest. EXPERIMENTAL I. Goat No. 258 was inoculated with goat-adapted rinderpest virus on 6 February 1935. She aborted on the 4th day and was slaughtered on the fifth day. (It is usual for pregnant goats to abort during an attack of rinder- pest.) The reaction was typical. As soon as the foetus was found the spleen was removed, with precautions against contamination, ground up in saline and inoculated into hill bull No. 428. This bull remained healthy for fifteen days and was tested on the 16th day with rinderpest bull virus. It developed rinderpest and died on the 13th day after the test indicating high susceptibi- lity to rinderpest. II. Goat No. 253 was inoculated on 20 February 1935 with goat rinder- pest virus. The animal reacted and was killed later. A full-grown foetus was removed. Spleen pulp and blood from this foetus were inoculated on 25 February 1935 into hill bull No. 614 and goat No. 283. Hill bull 614 remained healthy for 16 days and on the 17th day a test dose of goat blood virus (pro- pagated from the same mother goat, No. 253) was given. The animal deve- loped typical rinderpest but recovered. Goat 283 showed no thermal reac- tion, and died on the 10th day from another cause. III. Goat 221 was destroyed on the 6th day after virus inoculation, and a full-grown foetus removed. Spleen pulp and heart blood were collected from this foetus and inoculated into two healthy hill bulls, 201 and 215. Both bulls remained healthy, and on the 11th day were given test doses of bull virus. Both reacted somewhat severely to rinderpest but recovered. IV. Goat 27 was destroyed on the 7th day after virus inoculation and a full-grown foetus was removed. Spleen pulp and blood from this foetus were
M. K. SREENIVASAN 47 inoculated on 13 July 1939 into two healthy hill bulls, Nos. 85 and 73. Both bulls remained healthy and on the 17th day a test dose of bull virus was inject- ed. Both reacted severely to rinderpest but survived. V. Goat 411 died on the 8th day after rinderpest virus inoculation. A nearly full-grown foetus was removed immediately after death. Spleen pulp and blood from this foetus were inoculated on 18 March 1936 into healthy hill bulls, 720 and 727. There was no reaction in the bulls, and on the 14th day they were tested with bull virus. Both developed rinderpest, but survived. CONCLUSION The experimental data detailed above do not support the contention that the placenta of the goat is permeable to rinderpest virus.

A CHEAP AND ACCURATE HOME-MADE AUTOMATIC PIPETTE BY JOHN B. POLDING, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S. Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 22 August 1941) (With three text-figures) IN many bacteriological laboratories, certain routine technique can be simplified by employing an automatic distribution apparatus. Such an apparatus is particularly useful in filling antigen when numerous agglutina- tion tests are to be performed. Instruments may be purchased from manu- facturers but they are costly and, in the writer's experience, not always satis- factory. Home-made apparatus is often fragile and requires delicate adjust- ing and maintenance. The instrument about to be described costs only a few shillings and can be made by a good machinist in two or three hours. It is not easily damaged and, once calibrated, remains accurate indefinitely. In addition, it can be operated by unskilled labour and, by the simplest inter- change of parts, can be made to deliver any predetermined quantity from 0.25 c.c. to 10 c.c. The instrument is essentially a pump and consists of two partsJOHN B. POLDING 49 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Valve chamber with valves [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Construction of valves
50 Automatic Pipette Valves are prepared as follows : A piece of football bladder, cycle inner tube or sheet rubber of similar thickness is obtained. It should be flat and unperished. From it are cut two discs of the same diameter as the valve chamber. Each disc is marked with pencil along two diameters at right angles to one another. The disc is folded along one diameter and, in the centre of this fold (i.e. where it is traversed by pencil mark of the other diameter), it is ' nipped ' with a sharp pair of scissors for a distance of about 2 mm. In making this ' nip ', the scissors should form a small angle with the edge of the fold, the angle being big enough for the scissors to cut right through the rubber, producing a 2 mm. flap covering the aperture so made. The disc is unfolded and forms the completed valve (Fig. 2). The valve chamber is now ready for assembly and is placed vertically with the newly threaded end uppermost. A valve disc is placed against the lower end of the valve chamber with its valve flap opening freely upwards into the hole in the lower collar. Valve cap A is screwed on to this end of the valve chamber, so that the valve disc is squeezed flatly between the collar and the inner face of the cap. The upper valve disc is fitted in the same way between the upper collar of the valve chamber and the fibre washer placed on the inner face of valve cap B. The flap of this valve should open freely upwards into the central hole of this washer. The apparatus in position for assembly, but not screwed together, is shown in Fig. 1. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 3 Cylinder with piston CONSTRUCTION OF PISTON AND CYLINDER (Fig. 3) The piston and cylinder are made from an ordinary record syringe and different sizes may be prepared depending on the quantity of fluid to be delivered. When 0.25 to 0.5 c.c. quantities are required, a 1 c.c. syringe is used, for a 1.0 c.c. delivery a 2 c.c. syringe and so on. The syringes are in no way damaged and may be used for ordinary purposes when not employed in this apparatus. The construction, and calibration of a 1 c.c. syringe for 0.5 c.c. quantities are described but the methods are the same for all sizes of syringe. Strips of brass foil are obtained. These can be conveniently made from the flattened butts of discarded electric bulbs. A strip, in width rather
JOHN B. POLDING 51 greater than the measurement from the inside of the nozzle end of the syringe to the 0.5 c.c. mark on the barrel, is cut and curled in its length to form a cylinder equal to the inside diameter of the syringe barrel. The plunger is removed from the syringe and this cylinder slipped into the barrel. The cylinder serves as a distance piece to prevent the plunger being pushed into the barrel beyond the 0.5 c.c. mark (distance piece A, Fig. 3). A second distance piece, similarly made, is curled round the rod of the plunger between the piston and the barrel cap. The length of this distance piece must be such as to prevent the nozzle end of the plunger from being withdrawn from the barrel past the 1.0 c.c. mark, when the syringe is assembled (distance piece B, Fig. 3). Thus the two distance pieces one each side of the plunger permit the travel of the piston from just above the 0.5 c.c. mark to the 1.0 c.c. mark. The plunger is now spring loaded so as to be always in the position of full withdrawal. This is done by placing a small coil expansion spring between the cap of the syringe and the knob on the end of the plunger rod (coil spring Fig. 3). The choice of a spring is effected by trial and error, it should be of just sufficient strength always to withdraw the plunger to the 1 c.c. mark and hold it tightly against distance piece B. The syringe is calibrated to deliver exact quantities after the whole apparatus has been assembled. To do this the syringe is firmly connected to the needle butt in the valve chamber and then the whole assembly is supported in clamps on a stand. The end of the extension tube in valve cap A is immersed in a beaker of water and a rubber tube is connected to the nozzle of valve cap B. The system is primed by suction on the latter tube and, when full of liquid, bubbles are eliminated by tilting whilst the piston is pumped. A delivery nozzle is fitted to the tube attached to valve cap B. This should consist of a 5 c.c. bulb pipette, because, as it fills, an air lock forms in the bulb portion and this prevents syphon action if the end of the pipette is lowered below the liquid in the beaker. When the system is func- tioning satisfactorily, that is to say a squirt of liquid is discharged for each thrust on the piston, the liquid produced by 20 complete thrusts, is carefully collected in a dry 10 c.c. measuring cylinder. If the distance pieces have been properly made, this quantity should be rather less than 10 c.c. (if this is not so either of the distance pieces should be made longer). The distance piece A is now removed and filed a little shorter, after which the apparatus is reassembled and the measurement repeated. The measuring and filing process is continued until exactly 10 c.c. is produced from 20 complete pumps. MAINTENANCE (1) The apparatus should always be cleaned after use by replacing the fluid just delivered by carbol saline and pumping it through the system. (2) As the valves last longer if kept under carbol saline, the whole system is left full of this liquid. This is simply effected by leaving the suction tube in cap A immersed in the cleansing fluid and dropping the end of the delivery pipette into the same beaker. This forms a closed system and any slight back leak on the valves is of no consequence.
52 Automatic Pipette. (3) Once in six months the plunger of the record syringe may be faintly smeared with vaseline. (4) If at any time the head of liquid is lost, the system must be primed by suction before it will pump. (5) The valves may be tested occasionally by removing the beaker of saline. When this is done, no drip should occur from the suction pipe in valve cap A. If a drip occurs, it shows that the valves are either stuck or perished. If the former, the flap must be freed, and if the latter new ones can be made and fitted in a few minutes.
TREATMENT OF EQUINE SURRA IN ASSAM* BY V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN, G.M.V.C., P.G. (Mukr.) Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam (Received for publication on 2 January 1940) THE method of treatment of surra in equines, as followed in Assam, is described in this paper and a brief review is also made of other methods of treatment for comparison. It is well known that a great deal of work has been done on the chemotherapy of equine surra due to infection with Trypanosma evansi, as the disease causes very heavy mor- tality. Assam has sustained periodic losses due to infection with this parasite ; particularly in equines and bovines. The climatic and geographical condi- tions of Assam would appear to be favourable to the propagation of the infection. The province consists of two main valleys54 Treatment of Equine Surra in Assam and intrathecal doses were given. In very weak animals the initial intra- venous dose was given half in the first week and the other half in the following week. The successful adoption of this method by the Army Department and also by the various workers in the provinces resulted in the relaxation of certain regulations contained in the Glanders and Farcy Act of 1899 under which equine surra was scheduled. As a matter of fact, it may be noted that the destruction of equines under the Act for surra turned out to be past history consequent on the reliability and success of the treatment observed in most of the cases. This method of treatment involved fortnightly injections, intravenous and intrathecal, extending to a period of one month, efficient assistance in carrying out the intrathecal injections and also a good practice of the tech- nique itself Field workers who had to undertake the treatment of a large number of cases naturally found the method difficult, if not impossible. To overcome the obvious difficulties encountered in field conditions, suggestions were made and small experiments were carried out to ascertain the possi- bility of reducing the period as well as the number of injections without seriously interfering with the effect of the treatment. Besides, some cases were observed where intravenous injection of Naganol alone was capable of producing apparent recovery for a considerable period [Edwards, 1928]. But the elaboration of an intrathecal technique solved the difficult problem of sterilizing the cerebro-spinal system which otherwise would be a safe abode for the parasites least affected by the drug. In such cases relapses and even fatal terminations have been noted. It must also be admitted that cases of this nature have been fortunately rare. Various modifications were attempted to suit field conditions with a view to:V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 55 Experiments were conducted in Bombay to try " Intravenous alone " method for natural cases of equine surra. The dose used was 50 c.c. of 10 per cent solution per 1000 lb. body-weight given at intervals of 10 days. Satisfactory cure was reported after a period of 3 weeks and no relapse oc- curred even after 2 years in some cases under observation. Taylor [1934] found the combined method of treatment of Naganol and tartar emetic to be effective. The routine method of treating equine surra consisted of a course of seven intravenous injections at intervals of 4 to 5 days in the following dosage:56 Treatment of Equine Surra in Assam the preliminary experiments an intravenous injection of 100 c.c. of 2 per cent solution of Naganol was given followed by another dose of 150 c.c. (2 per cent) on the sixth day. Inconvenience was, however, experienced by the use of a large volume of the solution for the purpose of injection. With that end in view, it was reduced to 50 c.c. without affecting the required quantity of Naganol. In the early stages of the experiment all the cases treated were under observation up to a year. Some of the ponies treated in 1935 are healthy and working up to the moment of writing the paper. Out of 309 equines treated and observed so far (vide Table II) relapse of the disease was found in two ponies, four months after the treatment. It could not be definitely ascertained whether it was a relapse or a reinfection. Even considering them as cases of relapse the percentage would appear to be practically negli- gible. In a few cases urticarial eruptions, mild laminitis and sometimes cracking of the anus were recorded. But there had been no serious untoward effect and always satisfactory progress was noticed in the course of four or five days. The present routine method of treatment consists of two injections as noted below: 1st injection . . . . 50 c.c. of a 4 per cent solution of Naganol given intravenously immediately on microscopical confirmation of the disease. 2nd injection . . . . 50 c.c. of a 6 per cent solution of Naganol injected as above on the sixth day after the first injection. The treated cases are kept under close observation for three months follow- ing the last injection of Naganol and periodic microscopical examination of blood is carried out for detection of relapse, if any. On the whole, the results of the treatment have been most satisfactory. The opinion relating to the encouraging result of this treatment was expressed in the Annual Report for the year 1935-36 by the Director, Veterinary Department, Assam, to the effect that ' another signal success which the Department claims this year is a simple six days ' short course treatment of equine surra which proved almost 100 per cent a success as opposed to a complicated five weeks' course treatment of distinctly lesser efficacy hitherto followed'. Subsequent ex- periences have amply justified the claim. Some of the recent equine cases treated have been under the close observation of the writer and there was nothing eventful in the success of the treatment. The parasites disappeared from the general circulation in about 24 hours and there was subsidence of clinical symptoms in the course of a week. The average weight of a pony in Assam is about 500 lb. and a uniform dose of 5 gm. of Naganol in two doses of 2 and 3 gm. each, has been found sufficient to effect a satisfactory cure. The same dosage is recommended even for ponies weighing less than 500 lb. But for horses, a proportionately larger dose is advised, depending upon the body-weight. In this connection, a word about the cost of treatment is, however, necessary. Nowadays the treatment is so popular that the owners ungrudgingly pay for the cost of treatment which is limited to Rs. 10 per pony.
V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 57 PROPHYLAXIS In certain enbemic areas, espscially in Surma Valley, prophylactic treat- ment was tried. For an average pony, 50 c.c. of a 4 per cent solution of Naganol has been used once in a month during the season. As this work was started only in 1937, it will require some more time to draw definite conclusions. There is, of course, great demand for prophylactic treatment and no less than 200 ponies were given this treatment from 1 April 1938 to date. Relating to the problem of prophylaxis it is stated in the Annual Report of the C. V. D., Assam, for the year 1936-37 that incidentally it may be noted that the drug (Naganol) was also tried as a preventive against the disease in a very limited number of cases with apparent good result. At present great caution has been taken in regulating the issue of Naganol as the supply is likely to be affected due to war conditions. In this connection mention may be made of two recent products58 Treatment of Equine Surra in Assam injection method however desirable, does not appear entirely to eliminate the possibility of relapse [Mahajan, 1939]. Pfaff [1934] recommends that 0.4 gm. per 100-lb. body-weight is a safe dose and in most cases protects the animal for six weeks. Although a single injection cures ' most cases of surra' he also suggests that the same dose repeated on the eighth day will cure ' nearly all cases of surra '. It is essential to resort to a method that gives as far as possible no chance for relapse in the treated cases. From this point of view the method practised in Assam is quite satisfactory. In conclusion, it may be stated that if the method of treatment as now adopted in Assam be given a fair trial by field workers in other provinces, it will minimize the difficulties that confront workers and owners alike. The observation that the long course of treatment and the multiplicity of injections adversely affect the popularity of treatment must always be borne in mind ; these two factors have been reduced to the minimum in the method now recommended.

A SHORT NOTE ON CALVES WITH UNBIFURCATED HOOVES BY SULTAN SINGH, L.AG., B.Sc.AGRIC.(READING) Deputy Director of Agriculture, Cattle Breeding and Bundelkhand Circle, Jhansi, United Provinces AND R. K. TANDON, M.Sc., A.I.A.R.I. Divisional Superintendent of Agriculture, Bharari (Jhansi) (Received for publication on 9 July 1941) (With Plate II) BOVINE species of animals are provided with bifurcated hooves but a few instances of a strange abnormality have occurred at the Government Cattle Breeding Farm, Madhurikund. Eight calves consisting of six females and two males born of different parents showed lack of normal bifurcation in the hooves of the fore limbs. These hooves do not strictly compare with those of an equine but they taper down in form of an inverted cone or wedge [Plate I]. The exact nature of this abnormal character cannot be known unless elaborate breeding experiments are undertaken. These may be instances of only somatic variations or of an interesting genetic character of hereditary nature. The following table shows the pedigree of all the calves with abnormal hooves.

SELECTED ARTICLES THE CATTLE OF INDIA AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY F. WARE, C.I.E., F.R.C.V.S., F.N.I., I.V.S. Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India (With plates III-VIII) (Reprinted from The Empire Journal of Experimental Agriculture, Vol. IX, No. 33, January 1941) INTRODUCTION WHEN making a public presentation of two stud bulls for the improve- ment of cattle in Delhi Province, H. E. the Marquess of Linlithgow, the Viceroy of India and previously Chairman of the Royal Commission on Agri- culture in India, observed that' the cow and the working bullock bear on their patient backs the whole structure of Indian agriculture '. This remark puts in a nutshell the great importance of cattle to Indian economy. India is a vast agricultural country with a human population of 350 million people, 90 per cent of whom live on agriculture. The bullock is almost the only source of power available for carrying out the various agricultural operations extending over an area of about 300 million acres of cultivation, besides acting as the major road-transport animal. Most of the peoples are vegetarian and depend en- tirely on milk and milk products as the source of animal protein in their diets. The social and economic importance of cattle to India is therefore self-evident. The actual as well as the potential value of India's cattle industry is huge even in its present undeveloped state. The annual value of milk and milk products is by a conservative estimate not less than Rs. 300 crores (£225 million). The output of hides and skins, of which India is the largest exporter in the British Empire, is annually worth about Rs. 40 crores. Cattle labour is variously estimated to be worth between Rs. 300 and Rs. 500 crores annually, whilst the cash value of their manure, which may be used either for increas- ing soil fertility or as fuel, is about Rs. 270 crores. With such an enormous potential value, the question of developing this industry has naturally received attention, and a reference to the background of the problem may enable the reader to appreciate the difficulties in the way of rapid large-scale improvements in India. First, the number of cattle in India is far too great for the fodder resources of the country. The area of cultivated land available per head of bovine population is 1.8 acres, as compared with 3.4 acres in Great Britain, 4.5 in New Zealand, 31.4 in Canada, and 24.9 in U. S. A. The Royal Commission on Agriculture estimated that for every 100 acres of net sown area there are 21 acres fallow, 92 acres of grazing, and 20 bullocks, 17 cows, 16 other cattle, 3 male buffaloes, 3 female buffaloes, 5 young buffaloes, and 27 sheep and goats. This shows the pressure on the land and the acute nature of the fodder prob- lem. Over wide areas concentrates are fed only to transport ponies and bullocks and to milch buffaloes, the remainder of the live stock of a village having to depend on what roughage they can pick up. The grazing land is very poor after the monsoon, i.e. for most of the year, and in many localities 62
F. WARE 63 is then little more than an exercise ground. In the cold season animals graze on the crop stubbles, and may receive a supplement of straw or hay, but during the hot weather until the break of the rainy season the supply of fodder gradually diminishes and the feeding of stock becomes very difficult. Secondly, cattle breeding is mostly in the hands of small farmers who are poor and illiterate. According to the Report on a Village Enquiry [I], which records the results of an intensive survey in selected breeding tracts, the aver- age size of holdings in different parts of the country varies between 7 and 23 acres. These small areas have to support 6-9 persons and 3-7 head of cattle each. Such small farmers are naturally unable to invest capital in pedigree stud animals, and there has been a tendency to rely on quantity rather than quality, as an insurance against such cattle plagues as rinderpest and haemorr- hagic septicaemia, which have visited the country periodically in the past and carried off large numbers of animals. Thirdly, the cow is a sacred animal to the Hindu. According to the Vedas, she should not be slaughtered, but allowed to live after her economic period is over and die a natural death. In many parts of India these different factors are leading to a very serious situation. Not only is the result of overstocking seen in the shortage of food, but it is also one of the major causes of soil erosion, as Gorrie [2] wrote in 1937 : ' In much of India the last vestiges of shrub growth already form the ordinary daily ration for the village herd. The amount of erosion caused directly through this state of affairs has to be seen to be believed.' THE RECOGNIZED BREEDS OF INDIAN CATTLE The foregoing paragraphs draw rather a sorry picture of the general state of cattle in India, and the impression gained by casual visitors to this country, who judge the position by the cattle they see from the train, is usually much the same. It appears also that little is generally known outside India regard- ing the different breeds that are included under the generic term of Indian Zebu or Brahman cattle, and it is, therefore, of interest to record that the latest attempt to enumerate these has resulted in the compilation of a list containing 28 breeds of cattle, covering a wide range of size, colour, and capability, in addition to 7 breeds of buffaloes. It should be stated at once that there is a vast gulf between the capabili- ties of these animals and the ordinary village cattle, and it is proposed to show how these recognized breeds, which have already acquired a big reputation in tropical countries by reason of their drought-resisting qualities and ability to withstand attack by the major cattle plagues and tick-borne diseases, respond to better feeding and management, and what marked success has already been obtained in those breeds which have so far been selected for development. Before doing this, however, something must be said of the physical characteristics of Indian cattle, as compared with other Zebus, and an attempt made to answer some of the questions raised by Curson and Thornton [3] in their study of the African Native Cattle. These authors suggest that the humped cattle of Africa may be provisionally classified into true Zebus (Asiatic in origin) and pseudo-Zebus (African in origin). The first class is again E 2
64 The Cattle of India and their Development sub-divided into lateral-horned and short-horned, and these are described as possessing a long coffin-shaped skull with a convex profile and bifid thoracic superior spines. One of the divisions of the pseudo-Zebus is the lyre-horned, in which the skull is said to show marked evidence of Hamitic Longhorn in- fluence, being wide in the forehead and the orbital arches prominent. The profile is generally flat. No osteological material of the lyre-horned Zebu has been examined, a point of interest to future investigators. Another suggested classification of the Zebus is by the position of the hump, which may be either cervico-thoracic and muscular or thoracic and musculo-fatty. If this classi- fication is adopted, all present-day Indian cattle will fall into the latter class, with the exception of the Siri breed of Bhutan. Following the arrangement of Olver [4], Indian cattle may be divided into five well-marked groups : Group I. Lyre-horned grey cattle with wide forehead, prominent orbital arches, face flat or dished in profile, represented by the Kankrej, Malvi, and possibly Tharparkar, breeds. Group II. Short-horned white or light-grey cattle, with a long coffin- shaped skull, orbital arches not prominent, face slightly convex in profile, represented by the Bhagnari, Nagori, Mehwati, Rath, Hariana, Krishna Valley, and Ongole breeds. Group III. Ponderous, usually spotted red and white or brown and white, milch-type cattle with prominent forehead, pendulous dewlap and sheath, lateral and often curly horned, represented by the Gir, Sahiwal, Deoni, Nimari, and possibly Sindhi, breeds. Group IV. Medium-sized compact draught-type animals, usually grey, with tight sheath, very prominent forehead, long pointed horns arising close together, represented by the Hallikar (Amrit Mahal), Khillari, Kangayam, Alumbadi, and Bargur breeds. Group V. Small red or black cattle, often with white markings, short- horned, with tight sheath, poll and top of hump usually covered with coarse hairs, represented by the cattle of the Himalayan and Kumaon foot-hills, Lohani (Frontier Province), and Afghan breeds. In addition there are a number of isolated breeds, such as the Dhanni of the North Punjab, Ponwar of the United Provinces, and Gaolao of the Central Provinces, which cannot be fitted into any of the above groups, and are probably of more recent origin. This question of the origin of our domestic animals is always fascinating, and we are fortunate in India in being able to produce definite evidence that the same type of Zebu, which is found throughout the Indian sub-continent to-day, was in use as a domestic animal at the time of the ancient Indus-valley civilization represented by the ruined city of Mohan-jo-daro, which is estimated to date back to 3000 B.C. L. H. Shirlaw [5] points out that there were actually two types of cattle in existence at the time of this civilization, ' a massive large-horned humped form and a smaller form with short horns which may possibly have been hump- less '. It is also stated that the latter type is found only in the upper strata of the Mohan-jo-daro site, but there are abundant remains of humped bulls in every stratum. The author also quotes Sir John Marshall, who was in charge
F. WARE 65 of the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, as saying that this large humped breed is closely allied to, if not identical with, the magnificent white and grey breed still common in Sind, Northern Gujrat, and Rajputana, i.e. the animals in Group I, all of which are renowned for their splendid draught qualities. Olver [4] has also drawn attention to the resemblance between the Kankrej breed, whose home is in Northern Gujrat, and the animal depicted on the seal which was recovered from the Mohenjo-daro site (Plate III, c), and even more strik- ing is the resemblance between the animal on the seal, the lyre-horned Malvi breed of India, and the Peulhe or Gobra lyre-horned Zebu of West Africa, illus- trated in the work of Curson and Thornton [3]. There is also a great likeness between the Kankrej breed and African Fulani cattle, as depicted by the same authors. It would thus appear that the lyre-horned cattle of India and Africa may have had a common origin, but if so it is difficult to accept the theory of Curson and Thornton that the lyre-horned Zebu represents an intermixture between the Hamitic Longhorn, a humpless animal, and the short-horned Zebu, a comparatively modern animal in Africa and, apparently, in India also. According to Epstein [6], the short-horned Zebu is the result of inter- breeding in India between Bos brachyceros and the lateral-horned Zebu. The only evidence that the former ever reached India is the possibly humpless variety recovered from the upper strata of the Indus valley, and no specimens of the lateral-horned Zebu have yet been found, unless one looks upon the milch breeds in Group III as having affinities with this type, which is represented in Africa by the Afrikander. In this connexion it is noteworthy that Bosman [7] states that an Afrikander cow off the veld will give as much as 30 lb. of milk a day. In any case we may accept the contention of Olver [4] that the short-horned Zebu, i.e. the animals in Group II, but not the animals in Group I, accompanied the Vedic Indo-Aryans during their invasions of India, which according to Smith [8] occurred between 2000 and 1500 B.C. Smith emphasizes the fact that these immigrants have stamped an indelible mark on the whole country from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin, and the same may be said of this group of cattle, which contains some of the best dual-purpose (milk and draught) breeds in India. Their penetration is very remarkable, and examples of the group now stretch diagonally across the sub-continent from Kalat, outside the North-West Frontier, to a point on the south-east coast a few miles north of Madras. Not only this, but the changes which have taken place during the southern migration have been very slight, and anyone who is not very familiar with these different breeds would probably consider the present- day arrangement largely artificial and find difficulty in separating one from the other, as for example the four specimens shown in Plate IV. A reference has already been made to the possible origin of the animals in Group III, but this question awaits investigation before any pronouncement can be made. Suffice it to say that this group (Plate V) is of very great econo- mic importance to India, for included in it are those breeds which so far have shown the greatest potentiality as milk producers, as well as being suitable for crossing for beef purposes. The Gir, whose natural home is in the Gir forests of the Kathiawar peninsula on the west coast of India, is usually looked upon as the oldest and indeed the basic breed of this group, and it is an interest- ing fact that from time to time animals showing the characteristic colouring of the Gir turn up in pedigree herds of allied breeds.
66 The Cattle of India and their Development The essentially draught animals in Group IV are all found in the south of the peninsula, and may be said to be centred round the Hallikar breed of Mysore. The Amrit Mahal Department of that State has bred and developed these animals for many years past, and it was bullocks of this breed which received such high praise as transport animals from Sir Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, during his Indian campaigns. Nothing is known of the origin of the animals in this group (Plate VI), which are found covering a long but rather narrow plateau area from the Khillar tract in the south of the Bombay Presidency to the Bargur hills in the Madras Presidency. There is also an isolated collection of the Hallikar breed in Amrabad taluq in the south of Hyderabad State. Lastly we come to the small animals of Group V, which are the most widely distributed throughout India. Examples of this group (Plate VII) are found scattered through all the villages of the plains, but they contain much mixed blood, and only in the more hilly tracts are they found in any state of purity. Possibly they were animals of this group that were found in the upper strata of the Mohenjo-daro site, although it is suggested that the latter were humpless. These hill cattle, under ordinary conditions, show very little hump, but when well fed they develop into the typical musculo-fatty dorsal variety. They are very useful for ploughing work on the narrow terraces of the hill- sides on which they live, whilst in some of the breeds, e.g. Afghan and Lohani, the cows give as much as 12 lb. of milk a day. MEASURES ADOPTED FOR IMPROVEMENT (a) Activities of the Central Government.F. WARE 67 Sindhi, Hariana, Tharparkar, Sahiwal, and Kumaun Hill breeds of cattle, as well as the Murrah breed of buffaloes, and the success already obtained in some of these herds, details of which will be referred to later, is very marked. The Government of India has also recently given tangible proof of its interest in cattle-breeding by providing a sum of money for inaugurating an All-India Cattle Show, such shows having been held at New Delhi in February of each year since 1938. An All-India Cattle Show Society has now been formed and it is hoped, with the help of contributions from the Provinces and States, to make this Show an annual and permanent event. The advantages of such a show, where cattle-breeders can meet once a year and discuss their numerous problems and compare results, need not be laboured; it also provides a unique opportunity for foreign buyers to see at a glance what India has to offer in the way of well-developed breeds suitable for export. (b) Imperial Council of Agricultural Research.68 The Cattle of India and their Development In the field of disease-control one of the most important contributions made by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research is the appointment of Disease Investigation Officers in the various Provinces and States. The first batch was appointed in 1932, and a disease-investigation staff is now at work in every British province and in Hyderabad and Mysore States. When these officers were appointed it was emphasized that they should work in close collaboration with the Central Veterinary Research Institute at Mukteswar, should carry out comprehensive surveys of disease conditions in the field, and supply requisite material and information for detailed research. As expected, this scheme has provided a valuable liaison between the Central Institute and the field staff, and has proved an efficient agency for the application of the latest methods of disease-control. One of the most outstanding achieve- ments of the staff is the initiation of the new technique of goat-virus vaccina- tion against rinderpest, which is the most dreaded scourge of cattle-breeders in India. This new technique of rinderpest control, which is both cheap and effective, is now adopted as a routine all over the country both as a prophylac- tic and for the control of outbreaks. Its adoption has resulted in tremendous saving in the cost of immunization, and enabled the veterinary staff to confer protection on a much larger number of cattle than formerly. The work of the Disease Investigation Officers has also brought to light a mass of useful infor- mation on many other diseases, some very obscure, which, however, cannot be enumerated within the space of this article. Besides the disease-investigation officers' scheme, other research schemes relating to helminthological and protozoological problems, investigation into tuberculosis, Johne's disease, contagious abortion, &c., have also been put into operation by the Council. The various problems of animal nutrition have also been considered by the Council, and schemes relating to mineral metabolism, feeding-values of rice straw and other indigenous fodders, certain food grains, oil-seeds and cakes, and preparation of cattle-feeds from molasses, & c., have been in operation for several years now ; results of practical importance are accumulating. Another important step taken by the Council is the constitution of a Standing Central Fodder and Grazing Committee. The objects of this Commit- tee are to secure systematic and progressive improvement in grazing and grass land areas, and the conversion of waste lands into useful grazing wherever that is economically possible. Many of the provinces have set up local counter- parts of the Central Committee. As a result, work is now in progress over a large area, in collaboration with the local agricultural and forest departments, designed to secure both the prevention of erosion and the supply of larger quantities of cattle fodder. (c) Activities of the provinces.F. WARE 69 by selection. The Government cattle farms are managed on modern scientific lines, and regular and systematic records are maintained. Surplus bulls are distributed in villages for stud purposes on some sort of premium system, de- tails of which vary from province to province, with the object of grading up the inferior village stock in the locality. For this extension work the supply from the farms is supplemented by purchase of the progeny from approved bulls, when animals of the requisite quality are available, thus affording en- couragement to private breeders. These activities are, however, very limited and the total number of approved bulls at stud in the whole of India is not yet sufficiently large to produce an appreciable improvement in the general run of the cattle in the country as a whole. There are in all about 10,000 approved bulls at stud in British India, which is only one-hundredth part of the actual requirements. The personal interest shown by H. E. the Viceroy in cattle improvement and the appeal issued by him have helped to increase the number of approved bulls by about 25 per cent. The Veterinary Departments of the Provinces and States assist cattle improvement to a very large extent by the control of contagious diseases and the systematic castration of inferior males. Disease has been one of the greatest limiting factors in cattle improvement in India, and serious efforts are being made both in regard to prevention and cure. Rinderpest, which accounts for 60 per cent of the total mortality from contagious diseases, is the greatest menace, but, as already noted, a cheap and effective weapon of vaccination is now available for use against this plague. Over a million castrations are performed annually by the veterinary staff and the number is increasing steadily. Results obtained.70 The Cattle of India and their Development Three outstanding Sahiwal herds are those at the Imperial Agricultural Re- search Institute, New Delhi, the Punjab Agricultural College Farm, Lyallpur, and the Military Dairy Farm, Ferozepore. These herds were established about 25 years ago, and since then the overall average daily yield has increased from 5-6 lb. to 17-20 lb. The average lactation yield started with about 2,000 lb. of milk, and to-day it is over 7,000 lb. The monetary value of this work has been such that proved bulls from the herd belonging to the Imperial Agricul- tural Research Institute, New Delhi, have been sold for six times the price of an ordinary Sahiwal bull. An analysis made of the 289 lactations completed by the herd of 51 cows which existed at the Ferozpore Farm in 1932 showed that 117 lactations exceeded 6,000 lb., 66 exceeded 7,000 lb., 30 exceeded 8,000 lb., 16 exceeded 9,000 lb., and 6 exceeded 10,000 lb., including two pedigrees which produced between 12,000 and 13,000 lb. The average lactation length was 308 days, calving interval 408 days, and fat percentage of the milk 4.7. The average yield of all farm-bred Sahiwal cows in India during 1937-8 was 5,085 lb. of milk in 308 days. About 45 per cent of the total number of ani- mals is above this average. The high standard to which this breed has been developed is well shown in the photograph of ' Mudini' (Plate VIII, a) a Sahiwal cow belonging to the Military Farms Department and winner of a supreme championship at the All India Cattle Show of 1940. A herd of Tharparkar (Plate VIII, c) and a herd of Hariana (Plate IV, b) cattle were established at the Karnal Sub-station of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1923. The average yield of the foundation herd was 8.8 lb. during lactation. By 1934 this rose to 13.2 lb. in the Tharparkar herd and 14.1 lb. in the Hariana herd ; individuals have yielded up to 8,734 lb. in the former and 7,412 lb. in the latter herd. This Hariana herd is now located at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, whilst other herds of this breed are to be found at the Hissar Cattle Farm, Punjab, and at the Madhurikund Farm in the United Provinces. Other pedigree herds of Tharparkar cattle are maintained at the Patna Veterinary College and the Agricultural Farm, Kanke, both in Bihar. The latest averages for all Thar- parkar herds of farm-bred animals in India is 4,056 lb. of milk in 267 days, the proportion above the average being 46 per cent. Corresponding figures for Hariana are 3,426 lb. of milk in 308 days and 32 per cent. The Sindhi breed (Plate VIII, b) is maintained on many farms in India, some of the best-known herds being those at the Willingdon Cattle Farm, Karachi, the Livestock Research Station, Hosur, Madras Presidency, the Central Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore, and the Agricultural Institute, Allahabad, United Provinces. It is a breed which thrives under all climatic conditions in India, and is extensively used for grading up local inferior stock. The average of last completed lactations of farm-bred Sindhis is 3,934 lb. in 325 days. The highest yield reached is 9,283 lb. of milk in a lactation of 351 days. The bullocks of this breed have also a good reputation for work. No publication on milk production in India would be complete without a reference to the capabilities of the Indian buffalo (Plate VIII, d), which, as Kartha [11] has shown, is in many respects a more economical milk producer than either indigenous or cross-bred cattle. The average amount of butter-fat in buffalo milk may be placed at 7 per cent, and these animals are able to keep up their supply of this rich milk and maintain their condition in places where
F. WARE 71 cattle rapidly deteriorate. Of the different breeds of buffaloes in India, the Murrah has been most developed for milk production. The following table shows the averages of latest lactations and the highest lactation obtained in this breed of buffaloes and also in some of the less develop- ed breeds of cattle : Average Highest Murrah buffalo .... 4,037 lb. in 277 days 8,252 lb. in 318 days Gir...... 3,721 lb. in 333 days 5,188 lb. in 366 days Ongole ..... 3,164 lb. in 303 days 5,237 lb. in 365 days Kankrej ..... 3,159 lb. in 303 days 6,073 lb. in 358 days In order to obtain a correct picture of the improvement which has been obtained in some of India's milch breeds it is necessary to compare the yields obtained in farms run on modern lines with the performances noted in village breeding-areas. The following are the details of some breeds made available by an inquiry conducted in certain typical breeding tracts and made the sub- ject of a special report [1]: Breed Average daily yield lb. (average of 7 days) Average lactation.length in months Average dry period in months Sahiwal ...... 4.72 10.43 7.24 Hariana ...... 4.46 7.62 7.62 Kankrej ...... 3.90 7.90 10.21 Ongole ...... 4.64 9.54 9.47 Murrah buffalo .... 11.21 8.65 6.10 The interesting point which arises out of this inquiry is that, where village cattle are concerned, there is no significant difference in the levels of production of these different breeds, except the Murrah buffalo. This exception is largely explained by the fact that the buffalo is kept almost entirely for milk production and therefore more attention is paid by the villager to the rearing of heifer buffalo calves than to cow calves. Moreover, as the buffalo is not a sacred animal, some culling of this species has always been practised by the villager. The similarity in the yield of village cattle of the above breeds leads to the conclusion that the differences noticed in different herds may be indicative not so much of the intrinsic values or potentialities of the different breeds as milk producers, as of the differing amounts of attention paid to them. From the high levels already reached by certain breeds it is reasonable to assume that when equal attention is paid to all those showing potentialities as milk producers, they will respond equally well and provide breeders with satisfactory results. Another striking fact is the rapid rate of evolution which seems to be
72 The Cattle of India and their Development possible in these Indian breeds of cattle. The Sahiwal has reached in 25 years a level of milking performance which foreign breeds would have taken more than a century to attain.

MAKE FRUITFUL THE LIVESTOCK* (Reprinted from The Veterinary Record, Vol. 53, No. 17, April 26, 1941) THE Survey Committee's report and the ensuing discussion have dealt almost exclusively with the most pressing problems that call for solution by our profession at the moment. Much impressed by a recent pamphlet1 published by an agricultural scientist of outstanding eminence, Sir George Stapledon, entitled ' Make Fruitful the Land,' the present writer ventures the opinion that a much larger view is now demanded than has prevailed generally in the mind of the veterinary profession. To quote Sir George Stapledon : ' The truth is that unless, here and now, we do in all earnestness set about the re- habilitation of rural Britain74 Make Fruitful the Livestock Briefly, his views are the following : Stagnation and complacency tend to develop in such State institutions and there is a danger that science will become reduced in them to an official routine. Research may be devoted to objects which the politician or civil servant regards as of national import- ance for the moment and there is a danger that it will be planned by adminis- trators in offices instead of by enterprizing young men imbued with the spirit of pioneers in laboratories or workshops. The separation of teaching from research is a great disadvantage. This last aspect of the problem, together with the training of research workers, has been also dealt with by Professor Topley.1 It is not suggested that all Civil servants and all Government departments are endowed in the extreme with the disability of exerting the above baneful influence on the progress of research. The tendency, however, must be admitted to be a grave one. It can only be overcome if free rein is given to well-informed criticism. The growth of veterinary research under direct Government control is a development that is, therefore, not wholly to be deplored. It is contended strongly, however, that this development is one that ought to be accompanied by a corresponding strengthening of the vete- rinary colleges. For it is at the veterinary colleges that should prevail the atmosphere required for liberal criticism and independence in research. Large- ly through lack of funds the colleges now seem to continue their work under great difficulties. Because of the competing attractions of better equipped institutions the colleges will soon cease to attract or retain on their staffs the most gifted men capable of inspiring teaching. To promote a healthy and vigorous growth in veterinary research, and in adequate manner to teach veterinary students, the facilities for research and teaching at the veterinary colleges ought, therefore, to be greatly ex- tended. A new importance must be attached to clinical teaching of certain aspects of veterinary work which in the past have been woefully neglected, such as, for example, the reproductive disorders of farm animals. In the basic training of the student, there must be again to this end a new importance attached particularly to the subject of animal physiology and to all aspects of animal husbandry. It is only by the application of the knowledge that we ought to possess in these subjects that we can play a worthy part in live- stock production. Any future schemes of investigation, in animal husbandry or disease control, ought, it is felt, to be linked in as close a manner as is possible, with the activities of the veterinary colleges. It is hoped that Veterinary Investi- gation Officers will come to occupy an important place in the work of the Sur- vey Scheme when it reaches fruition and that their numbers will be greatly increased. The most appropriate base from which the Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer should operate is, in the view of the present writer, a veterinary college. The Officer at such location would be able to draw on the knowledge of his colleagues and in turn provide them with themes and materials for in- vestigation. His experience and knowledge could not but be beneficial to the student. At present it is distressing to contemplate the paucity of first-hand knowledge placed within the reach of the veterinary student. 1 Lancet. (1938), ii, 6014.
Make Fruitful the Livestock 75 From the writer's vivid recollection of present deficiencies in training through having recently passed through a veterinary college there are, in his submission, changes in the curriculum that could and ought to be made imme- diately. Far less attention need now be paid to the anatomy, medicine and surgery of the horse and dog. Far more attention ought to be paid to pre- ventive medicine and animal husbandry as affecting the food animals, parti- cularly the cow. The interest of the student in animal nutrition and genetics should be sustained during the final two years of the curriculum. It is essential that the course in physiology should cover two years, of which the second year should be devoted to the applied physiology of the domesticated animals, and stress be given to the special physiology of the digestive system and re- productive systems of the food animals. These subjects ought to be taught by none other than men who have devoted themselves to their special study, and students ought to be examined afterwards by none other than men who are fully conversant with recent developments in the subjects. To obtain an insight into agricultural methods, which cannot be obtained by merely ' seeing practice ' students should be compelled to spend at least six months working on a farm. Long ago, Sir John M'Fadyean, to his credit, emphasized that the progress of veterinary science must in the first place depend upon the training of the veterinary student. It is on our insistence upon the fundamental importance of this matter of the training of the student that will come to de- pend our professional ability to effect some amelioration in the country's livestock production and ultimately it will be the vindication for the continued existence of the veterinary profession itself. In our war-time planning, there- fore, we must press for the changes advocated with all our endeavour.NEW METHODS OF PRODUCING PROTEIN FOR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION (Reprinted from The Veterinary Record, Vol. 53, No. 23, 7 June 1941) DURING war-time the normal supplies of protein imported from overseas in the form of concentrates such as linseed and cottonseed cake have become largely cut off. For some years scientists have been at work to find out possible substitutes. The production of protein at home can be increased in a number of ways, perhaps the most important being a sound system of rotational farming and the more extensive use of silage. There are, however, limits to which such expedients can be extended, and with their fullest use the vital problem of ensuring an adequate protein supply ultimately for the human population is not likely to be solved. It is especially in Germany that work has been carried out to anticipate the current emergency, and the investigations have been well recorded, so that, if desired, they can be put into application elsewhere. For example, the technique of fish farming has been well studied.1 A fish pond is, acre per acre, a more efficient producer of protein than is good farmland. When suitably treated sewage is introduced to pro- vide nutriment for the minute floating animals and plants on which the fish feed it is even more efficient. Probably the many disused gravel pits in the home countries could be put to this use. Seaweed in enormous quantities could be collected from the shallow waters near our coasts without employing shipping needed for other tasks. There are some animalsABSTRACTS Bull indexing. E. B. RICE and D. J. SHEAHAN (1941). Queensland J. Agri 55, 2, 126. THE genealogical history of each breed of dairy animals must be tabulated in Herd Books. It must then be assumed that milk yield and butter fat contents are factors which depend upon genes which are transmissible according to established Mendelian rules of heredity. Milk yields should then be recorded. These premises having been completed, the fundamental basis for dairy herd improvement is established. Until the introduction of bull indexing, the milk and butter fat yields could be as- certained for only the females. The male, however, is more important, economically, because of its greater number of progeny than that of any one female. Out of the need to determine the capacity of bulls to sire high producing daughters grew the various methods of proving bulls. Such systems have been adopted in several countries during the last two decades. A bull is ' proved ' by comparing the milk and butter fat records of his daughters with those of their dams. Yuill, of Victoria, recommends that ' there should be at least ten daughters from at least five tested dams ', although in practice all daughters' records should be compared with their dams. The ' proved ' bull sires daughters which definitely produce more milk and/or more butter fat than their dams. The United States Depart- ment of Agriculture found that only 52 per cent of 2242 bulls in the United States were capable of doing this. Of 51 sires in selected herds studied in England, eight were found to increase the production of their daughters over their dams. Artificial insemination, it is suggested, would greatly assist the distribution of the germ plasm of such bulls. Although many systems of comparing records of daughters and their dams have been developed, the 'Mount Hope Commercial Index ' is used in Queensland. The most important factors affecting the production of a cow, and therefore the index, are ' age of the animal, the effect of environment, the length of dry period before commencing lacta- tion, calving period, feeding, etc. ' Age correction is possible. Furthermore, the greater the number of comparisons the less will be the effect of the other factors. The bull index is based on the fact that the average production of, the daughters is half way between that of their parents. This applies to both milk and butter fat yield. In the Mount Hope Commercial Index the milk yield is age corrected and the actual test averaged. The daughters are then placed midway between the dam and their sire giving, thereby, the index of the sire. For example, if the average age corrected butter fat yield of all dams is 350 lb. and that of their daughters, from the same bull, is 375 lb., the index of the bull is 400 lb. Age correction may be accomplished in many ways. Such correction is based on the fact that a two-year old cow gives 70 per cent of its mature yield, a three-year old 80 per cent and a four-year old 90 per cent. Yuill has worked out a table, giving at a glance the age corrected figure for pounds of fat or gallons of milk, which is included in the article. [J. N. W.] Uniformity through inbreeding. J. E. BALMER (1941). Holstein-Friesian World 38, 10, 533. THE theory of inbreeding is based on the fact that ' uniformity will best be achieved by making the germ cells more uniform '. To accomplish this, animals are mated to close relatives. Protoplasm is so complex that it cannot be analysed chemically ; it can only be analysed by different matings. Line-breeding, inbreeding and in-and-in breeding are each an attempt to concentrate the protoplasm of a particular family ; they differ only in the degree of concentration they effect. Inbreeding with rigid selection, it is said, is more useful for protoplasm analysis, or more specifically germplasm analysis, than outcrossing. Gones may become so dilute and dissipated from outcrossing that uniformity is almost impossible. 77 F
78 ABSTRACTS Inbreeding involves crossing two animals related to the extent of 50 per cent or more. Examples of such matings are : ' full brother and sister, half brother and sister, sire and daughter, and son to dam. ' Line-breeding involves two animals of between 25 and 50 per cent identity of inheritance. Some workers suppose that line-breeding permits con- centration of genes from a larger number of individuals without the dangers of the high concentration and its accompanying weaknesses possible with inbreeding. Variations between full brothers and/or sisters in all classes of animals confirm the contention that genes cannot be mixed with uniform results as can two chemical reagents. Some autho- rities recommend such mixing, however, if under expert guidance. Authorities like Castleman, Marshall and East refer to the value of inbreeding. Castleman also says, ' We use it but feel that in so doing we are playing with fire. ' East reminds us that very rigid laws have prevented the importation of any cattle, except for slaughter, to the Jersey or Guernsey islands since .1763. Each of these islands, therefore, has a breed of cattle that is very highly inbred. He adds that this fact will be more fully appreciated when it is realized that the larger island, Jersey, is only eleven miles long by six miles wide. The famous Jersey bull, Sybils Gamboge, which sold for $65,000, was the result of half brother and sister matings for four generations. Sixty generations of inbreeding have made it possible for Dr Helen King at the University of Pennsylvania to produce rats which are the exact duplicates of their parents. Records exist of flocks of sheep which have been maintained a hundred years with no introduction of new animals. Horses have been inbred for size and speed with good results. Defects as well as points of merit may be concentrated by inbreeding. The practice must obviously be carried out by an expert breeder and be accompanied by rigid selec- tion. Inbreeding, however, without discrimination and rigid selection will yield more evil results than good. [J. N. W.]. Inheritance of horns and scurs in sheep. H. I. IBSEN and R. F. COX (1940). J. Heredity 31, 7, 327. FOUR pairs of genes for horn or scur formation in sheep are discussed in this paper as follows : 1. H and P, horned and hornless respectively. ' HH animals of both sexes are horned, provided other genes, mentioned later, do not interfere. PP animals of both sexes are hornless. In heterozygotes (HP),H is dominant in males and P in females.' 2. Ih and ih which inhibit horn formation. Dominance is complete in both sexes. Because of the interaction of a third pair of genes, however, ihih females are sometimes hornless, whereas ihih males are always horned. 3. Hm and hm. The latter is the horn modifier gene. Hm prevents hm from having any effect. If either male or female is homozygous or heterozygous for Hm or if the male is homozygous for hm, modification does not occur ; if, however, the female is homozygous for hm, modification occurs. 4. Sc and sc mani- fest themselves only in hornless animals, producing scurs when Sc is present ; sc is the recessive gene for this character. The expression of Sc, when heterozygous with sc, is affected by the presence of Ih in pure bred 'polled ' Rambouillet females but not in the males. Whether females of this breed, if ScSc, have scurs when Ih is present is not known. The authors mention that crosses between certain horned and hornless breeds give F1 progeny of which all males are horned and all female hornless although they develop scurs later in life. This they explain by assuming that H is dominant in the male and its allelomorphic gene P is dominant in the female. It also explains both horned and horn- less progeny of either sex in the F2 generation of such a cross. (F1 = HH × PP = HP ; and F2 = HP × HP = HH + 2HP + PP). The Dorset Horn and the Suffolk breeds, res- pectively, may illustrate the horned and hornless breeds involved. No satisfactory genetic explanation has yet been given, however, for pure breeds in which the males are horned and the females are hornless. Arkell's data support the theory that the Rambouillet breed is homozygous for horned (H) and also homozygous for a horn modifier gene (hm) which causes the female to be hornless. Thus, in both sexes the constitution will be HH hmhm while ordinary horned breeds are HH HmHm. Arkell mentioned occasional hornless males of this breed in 1912 indicating P was present although more recently no such condition has been reported. From the absence, at present, of occasional hornless males, and therefore of females
ABSTRACTS 79 carrying this character in a heterozygous form, it is obvious that from crosses of a Dorset Horn male and a Rambouillet female all porgeny will be horned. HH HmHm × HH hmhm gives HH Hmhm. All progeny is horned as H is dominant in the male whereas in the female hmhm is necessary for horn modification. A number of clean-polled purebred Rambouillet rams has been found. Warwick et al. furnish evidence of a dominant horn-inhibiting gene in this breed. They designate it H, but since the authors of the present paper have used this symbol in another sense, Ih is used instead. Ihih female Rambouillets have horn pits or- depressions, whereas ihih females do not; otherwise no evidence exists to show Ih inhibits horn production in them. The observations of both Warwick et al. and the present authors agree that in ihih Rambouillet females scurs or knobs were always found. It is concluded that hm when homozygous does not completely inhibit all indications of horn formation. The composition, therefore, of the ordinary purebred Rambouillet is HH hmhm ihih, whereas that of the true breeding strain of polled sheep of this breed is HH hmhm IhIh. The Southdown, a hornless breed, also carries Ih, although most hornless breeds, as already stated, are PP. Arkell crossed a Dorset Horn ram with several Southdown ewes. Of seven lambs, four were horned females and three hornless males. A reciprocal cross produced three horned males and one hornless female. The production of ' hot house ' lambs by crossing the Southdown ram to grade Rambouillet or Dorset Horn ewes almost always gives progeny which is hornless like the sire. The Southdown appears, therefore, to be homozygous for Ih, ' or at least for a gene having the same effect.' The genetics of scurs is not well known. When Ih is present, scur seems to be absent. Twenty-six Rambouillet ewes at Kansas State College were examined for scurs. Fourteen were found without scurs, ten had small scurs and two had large scurs. Those without scurs had bony protuberances of the skull, varying somewhat in size, under skin devoid of wool. The authors feel that the evidence supports the theory that Sc is an incom- pletely dominant gene, expressing itself only when horns are absent. They suggest a homozygous dominant ScSc has long scurs, a heterozygous Scsc has short scurs and a homozygous scsc has no scurs. Warwick et al. refer to results of a scurless Rambouillet ram crossed to many typical Rambouillet ewes, some with scurs and some without, to show that Ih prevents the expression of Sc in Scsc females but not in males of this com- position. Note.80 ABSTRACTS better gains and had much better appearance and a finer coat of hair than those of the animals on corn oil and cocoanut oil. The females of each group were mated with the males of the same group. Litters of butter-fat group were all normal and were raised to maturity. The litters of the other groups were small and very weak. The mortality was also high. No litters were obtained from the females of cocoanut oil group. In the second observation, cotton seed oil and soyabean oil were included in the feeding experiment. The arrangement of the experiment was exactly the same as in the previous one. The difference in the growth rate appeared most noticeable during the first three weeks both in the males and females. The gains made by the rats on butter-fat group were 22 per cent greater than that on corn oil, 23 per cent than that on cocoanut oil, 14 per cent than that on cotton oil and 26 per cent than that on soyabean oil. The fertility showed no change from that which was observed in the first experiment. In another experiment, the authors tried to ascertain whether the saponifiable or the non-saponifiable fraction of butter-fat was responsible for the better growth and improved reproduction. The diets containing the vegetable oils were supplemented with the non-saponifiable fraction of butter-fat and the animals were treated exactly in the same manner as in the two previous experiments, that is, records of growth, general health and reproductive power were studied. The animals on supplemented diets showed no better response than those fed on vegetable oils without the non-saponifiable fraction. Growth and general health were practically the same and there was considerable diffi- culty in raising the pups on supplemented diet, though the animals were receiving all the factors for reproduction. The authors concluded that the factors responsible for the better growth and reproduction lie in the saponifiable fraction of the butter-fat. [D. N. M.] The length of time required for depletion of vitamin A reserves in range cattle, J. K. RIGGS (1940). J. Nutr. 20, 491-500. AN experiment was designed to record the length of time required for the deple- tion of vitamin A reserves in two hundred and seventy range cattle of varying ages. The calves ranged in age from 3 to 8 months and in. weight from 225 to 467 pounds. The yearlings were approximately 16 months old and averaged 559 pounds in weight. Complete depletion was measured by observing the progressive nature of night blind- ness in all the animals. The observation consisted in driving all the animals in a court yard having a series of obstacles and noting the peculiar movement of the animals imme- diately after twilight; when the animals were completely nightblind, they tumbled against the obstacles. The animals were grouped according to age and the nature of the ration fed. The first group consisted of 48 steer yearlings and were on a ration containing 12 per cent cotton seed meal, 88 per cent cotton seed hulls and salt ad lib. The time required for depletion ranged from 128 to 266 days with an average of 178 and a standard deviation of 37. The second group of 40 steer calves received a ration composed of 3 per cent tankage, 10 per cent cotton seed meal, 87 per cent cotton seed hulls and salt ad lib. The depletion time ranged from 101 to 206 days with an average of 136 and a standard devia- tion of 25. Fifty steer calves were in the third group and were on the same ration as fed to the second group. The depletion time ranged from 96 to 194 days with an average of 138 and a standard deviation of 21. The fourth group consisting of 50 steer calves received the same ration as taken by the second and third groups of animals and deve- loped night blindness within a period ranging from 82 to 155 days with an average of 107 and a standard deviation of 21. The age of the animals of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th groups varied from 6 to 8 months and that of the 5th and 6th groups of animals varied from 4 to 6 months and of the 7th and 8th groups from 3 to 5 months. Groups 3 and 4 were fed limestone flour at the rate of 0.1 pound per head daily. The fifth group of 30 heifer calves received a ration having in it 3 per cent tankage, 15 per cent cotton seed meal, 30 per cent sorghum grain, 50 per cent cotton seed hulls, 1 per cent limestone flour and 1 per cent salt. Depletion time varied from 82 to 112 days with an average of 98 and a standard deviation of 7. The ration of the sixth group of 10 steer calves comprised 13 per cent cotton seed meal, 38 per cent sorghum, 49 per cent sorghum fodder, limestone flour and salt ad lib. The time required for the depletion of vitamin A reserve
ABSTRACTS 81 ranged from 83 to 90 days with an average of 86 and a standard deviation of 5. The seventh group of 20 steer calves maintained on a ration containing 12.5 per cent cotton seed meal, 25 per cent sorghum grain, 62.5 per cent cotton seed hulls, limestone flour and salt ad lib. developed night blindness within a period varying from 65 to 131 days with an average of 79 and a standard deviation of 17. The 8th group of 12 steer calves were on a ration containing 15 per cent cotton seed meal, 28 per cent sorghum grain, 57 per cent sorghum fodder, limestone flour and salt ad lib. The depletion time ranged from 46 to 61 days with an average of 56 and a standard deviation of 6. Carotene content per gm. of the grain varied from 0.3 µg.-0.5 fig. and of the sor- ghum fodder per gm. approximated to 4 µg. The animals of the seventh group were fed on sorghum fodder containing 2 µg. of carotene per gm. for the first 58 days and cotton seed hulls thereafter. The effect of significant amount of carotene in alfalfa leaf meal which supplied 1000 µg. of carotene per 100 lb. live-weight of another group of ten heifer calves daily was the lengthening of average depletion time of 96 days by 15 more days. It is concluded, therefore, that the influence of age and the nature of previous food supply is most significant in the depletion of vitamin A reserve of range cattle. [B. C. R. S.] Values of various protein feeds for growing chicks. R. M. SHERWOOD and J. R. COUCH (1940). Texas. Agri. Exp. Sta. Bull. No. 588, pp. 1-20 (16 refs.). IN a series of six experiments vacuum dried fish meal was fed to chicks as it was found that it had a higher biological value and contained higher amounts of vitamins A and G than those of fish meals prepared at high temperatures. In these particular experi- ments fish meal gave better growth results when fed along with soyabean oil meal and cotton seed meal than meat and bone scraps. Fish meal also proved superior to meat and bone scraps when used as a supplement along with peanut meal and cotton seed meal or soyabean oil meal. In addition to better growth fish meal also gave more econo- mical food consumption per unit of gain in weight. A supplement of 3 parts of fish meal and 3 parts of meat and bone scraps gave better results than 6 parts of meat and bone scraps but poorer results than 6 parts of fish meal. These experiments are however somewhat open to criticism as no effort was made to feed equal levels of protein but these variations do not appear sufficiently great to produce such wide differences in the growth results. In other comparisons chicks fed on supplements of fish meal, meat and bone scraps and soyabean oil meal grew faster and made more economical food utilization than chicks fed on meat and bone scraps, cotton seed meal and soyabean oil meal. Supplements of fish meal, meat and bone scraps and cotton seed meal gave better results than supple- ments of meat and bone scraps, cotton seed meal and soyabean oil meal. Chicks fed on liver meal as a protein supplement made lower gains in weight and consumed more food per unit of grain than chicks fed on fish meal supplements. In other experiments chicks fed on supplements of cotton seed meal, soyabean oil meal and fish meal or meat and bone scraps made more rapid gains in weight than those fed on peanut meal, soyabean oil meal and fish meal or meat and bone scraps. Suppl- ements of peanut meal gave poorer growth results than soyabean oil meal. In two experiments a protein supplement containing 1/3 part soyabean oil meal gave no better results than similar protein supplements containing 1/3 part cotton seed meal. Further data indicated that in a mixed protein supplement the substitution of part of the soyabean oil meal supplement with linseed oil meal resulted in a lowering of the growth rate. In mixed protein supplements there was no indication of any advant- age in a partial replacement of cotton seed meal with linseed oil meal. In another series of experiments to test out the adequacy of the rations for vitamin G it was found that supplements of fish meal, cotton seed meal and soyabean oil meal and alfalfa leaf meal were not improved by the addition of various proportions of dried whey. In another experiment where the fish meal was replaced by meat and bone scraps, the addition of 1 per cent dried whey improved the rate of growth [A. J. M.]
82 ABSTRACTS Streptococcal infection in the commercial horse. S. L. HIGNETT and W. S. KING (1940). Vety. Jour. 96, 81-84. HORSES are more readily infected with Streptococci than any other domestic animal. Streptococci produce a variety of local and generalized disease conditions in horses such as strangles, sinusitis, pneumonia and metritis and they are the commonest secondary invaders in wounds, pollevil, fistulous withers and quittor. Lancefield's group C Streptococci, the chief member of which is Streptococcus equi are found associated with a variety of these local and generalized disease conditions. Though good results have been claimed by many workers by the extensive use of vaccines (autogenous and stock vaccines) in the prevention and treatment of streptococcal infec- tions, such claims have not been supported by controlled experiments. The authors claim excellent results in the treatment of localized streptococcal in- fections by the use of certain acridine dyes, e.g. Entozon and acriflavine in dilutions of 1 in 150 and 1 in 1000 respectively. Generalized streptococcal infections such as strangles and pneumonia responded readily to sulphanilamide treatment. Sulphanilamide is ad- ministered in capsule, the dose being 3 to 5 drachms per cwt. body weight. [K. I.] Eperythrozoonosis in cattle. W. O. NEITZ (1940). Onderstepoort J. Vet. Sc. and Anim. Indust., 14, 9-24 (five photomicrographs, five tables, and nine refs.) THE author has described an infectious disease of cattle caused by Eperythrozoon wen- yoni.

GAPUZ, B. RUFINO (1940). Philipp. J. Anim. Indus., 7, 153-159. INFUSIONS of crushed fresh roots of Derris philippinensis proved effective against lice (Menopon spp. and Lipeurus spp.) infesting White Leghorns and Rhode Island Reds in the Philippines. The roots were crushed with a hammer and steeped in water in the proportion of 1 : 20 for 2 or 3 days and the 5 per cent solution thus obtained killed the lice in 6 hours, whilst concentrations of 2 and 1 per cent killed them in 12 and 24 hours respectively. The 5 per cent solution retained its killing power for 7 days, but it had practically no effect on the lice after 14 days. The fresh infusion, when used in any of the three concentrations mentioned above, destroyed also the eggs, as was evidenced by the fact that no nymphs or adults were encountered on treated birds that had been confined in individual cages for 5 weeks, which, in the case of chicken lice, represents the period from the egg to the adult stage. In another series of experiments, crushed derris roots, that had been dried for 2½ months in shade, were steeped in water and the killing power of the infusion thus obtained was tested in concentrations of 1, 0.5 and 0.25 per cent; only the first two of these concentrations proved lethal for adult lice. An infusion of crushed fresh stems of D. philippinensis, when used in a concentration of 20 per cent, was found to be ineffective. In all the trials, the infusions were used in the form of dips, the latter having been slightly warmed to facilitate thorough drenching. In the Philippines, the best time for dipping birds was found to be 10 o'clock in the morning. [S. K. S.] Inoculation and immunity experiments on calves with the vole strain of acid- fast bacilli. A. S. GRIFFITH and T. DALLING (1940). J. Hyg. 40, 673. SINCE Wells [1937] reported the occurrance of tuberculosis among wild voles, new possi- bilities of attack of the problem of tuberculosis opened up. The vole acid fast bacilli is not virulent for the guinea-pig when administered in small doses intraperitoneally or in large doses subcutaneously. In this paper, the authors have tried to explore the possibility of using the vole strain as an immunizing agent against tuberculosis. Experiments with guinea-pigs (1) Ten guinea-pigs received subcutaneously nine weekly doses (eight of one mg. and the ninth of 2 mg.) of the vole strain of acid-fast bacilli. Four weeks after the ad- ministration of the last dose the treated animals along with five controls were injected subcutaneously with 0.001 mg. of virulent bovine bacilli. The controls died of generalized tuberculosis in from 67 to 111 days averaging 87 days. The treated guinea-pigs died in from 109 to 225 days, averaging 152 days, showing lesions typical of infection with viru- lent tubercle bacilli. The effect of the Vaccine was simply to delay the development of tuberculosis. (2) In the second experiment eight guinea-pigs received subcutaneously seven weekly injections (two each of one mg. and five each of 2 mg.). One day after the last dose these guinea-pigs were tested along with four controls by the subcutaneous inoculation of 0.01 mg. of bovine bacilli. The controls died of generalized tuberculosis in from 51 to 93 days. The vaccinated guinea-pigs killed 94 and 95 days after the test dose, showed less advanced lesions. Experiments with calves It is essential to note that calves for these experiments were obtained from the tuberculosis-free herd maintained at the Agricultural Research Council's Field Station at Compton. (1) Effect of inoculating calves with the vole strain of acid-fast bacilli. Thirteen calves were inoculated, one intra-muscularly, some intra-venously and others subcutaneously with the vole strain. The intra-muscular dose was 80 mg., the intravenous dose ranged from 0.01 to 10 mg. and the subcutaneous dose ranged from 20 to 75 mg. Six of these
84 ABSTRACTS received a second dose of the vole strain. One calf died of allergic reaction following the inoculation of the second dose. Another calf died from non-specific causes. All the rest remained apparently healthy. Two of these were killed 44 and 89 days respective- ly after the injection to follow the reaction due to the inoculation of the vole strain of acid-fast bacilli. From careful post mortem, histological and cultural examinations, it was concluded that the vole strain was able to excite in calf a tuberculous reaction, chronic in nature, which tended to disappear without leaving many traces. It was also ascertained that sensitiveness to tuberculin following injection of the vole strain deve- loped very early.

A., 1941, pp. xiii and 403, 45 illus. cloth, $5.5) FOR a variety of purposes animals have been brought under man's care and dominion. They have been the motive power for his progress from ' cave- shelter to pent-house. ' They have supplied him both ' bountiful larder and plentiful labour. ' But this ' deviation of man from the state in which he was placed by nature seems to have proved to him a prolific source of disease.' Animals have not only ministered to the wants of man and even saved millions from death but ' they have also sent untold millions to death. ' Diseases of animals are therefore of great importance in relation to public health. A review of current literature shows that the role which animals play in the dissemination of disease among human beings has become the acute problem of the day and the appearance of the second edition of Hull's book at this time is really very opportune. The object of the author as stated in the preface to the first edition has been to afford a common meeting ground where the veterinarian, the physician, the laboratorian and the health official might under- stand each other's phase and angle of view of the problem of diseases trans- missible from animal to man, which so immediately concerns them and through their concerted efforts to reduce the number of infections which man contracts from animals. The first edition of this book appeared in 1930. In this second edition the author, as stated in the preface, has revised and brought up-to-date all chapters, re-written those on animal parasites, fungous diseases and psitta- cosis and added new chapters on louping ill, sore mouth of sheep, equine encephalomyelitis, Rift Valley fever, typhus fever and relapsing fever. This shows what a vast amount of advance has been made in the short priod of 11 years. Having been deprived of full opportunities for personal observations in connection with these advances the author has sought the aid of workers86 REVIEW e.g. amoeba, Balantidum coli, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, Trichinella spiralis, fungous diseases (including actinomycosis, sporotrichosis, ringworm, epizootic lymphangitis, histoplasmosis in mice). Section II contains seven chapters and deals with the following rodent infections, viz. plague, tularaemia, leptospirosis, rat bite fever, typhus fever, Rockey Mountain spotted fever, and relapsing fever. Section III deals wtih human diseases spread by animals and contains four chapters, viz. the relation of human infections to animals, septic sore-throat, diphtheria, scarlet fever. Section IV which deals with animals as passive carriers of disease organisms, contains three chapters, viz. botulism, tetanus and gas gangrene. Section V gives a review of the role played by each animal in the spread of diseases described in the preceding chapters. Each chapter is as gripping as the other, and manifestly revealing. The descriptions of the diseases are good. The text is concise but space is not spared where details are imperative. The historical background at the beginning of each chapter arouses interest, the epidemiology and epizootology receive special attention, the details of bacteriology and semiology have been wisely kept down and the methods of prevention well presented under each disease. The sta- tistical records given in tabular form are extremely useful. The ' items of note' forms a very commendable close to each chapter and enables one to note the salient points at a glance. Following the ' items of note' is a good bibliography to guide the reader to more detailed information. There are, however, certain omissions. Thus, under tuberculosis no refer- ence has been made to the possible existence of filterable types. A reference to the ancient treatise Hatyayurveda or Elephantology which dates back to the period of the Ramayana epic and contains an account of tuberculosis in elephants may be made in future editions. Reference to the work of Okell, Dalling and Pugh on ' Yellows in dogs ' might have been made under lep- tospirosis. The illustrations numbering 45 are good and well reproduced. A few more pictures of human beings showing affections transmitted to them from animals would add greatly to the value of the book. It covers a wide and comprehensive field in comparative pathology and certainly deserves a high rank. It is only recently that workers in human and veterinary medicine have become fully alive to the need of a spirit of collabora- tion in handling common problems. In the United States all workers appear to be alive to the imperative need of this collaboration. In England, Sir Frederick Hobday's appointment as Lecturer in Comparative Medicine at St. George's Hospital Medical School and the creation of a Section of Comparative medicine in the Royal Society of Medicine, London, indicate progress in the right direction. Here, in India, the spirit of collaboration is yet dormant and it is hoped that books like Hull's will create interest amongst the medical and veterinary professions on diseases of common interest and result in their greater cooperation for combating such diseases. The publishers are to be congratulated for their share of the work. Print- ing is clear, typography pleasing, binding good and the illustrations well reproduced. [P. G. M.]
ORIGINAL ARTICLES THE LIFE-HISTORY OF OESOPHAGOSTOMUM RADIATUM, THE BOVINE NODULAR WORM BY M. ANANTARAMAN, M.A., M.Sc. Madras Helminthiasis Scheme, Madras Veterinary College (Received for publication on 11 July 1941) (With Plates IX-XI and 25 text-figures) INTRODUCTION THE Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, in inaugurating a Helmin- thological Research Scheme in the Madras Presidency, has chosen definite parasites of cattle for a study of their life-histories, so that the data col- lected therein would form the scientific basis for the suggestion of control measures. This article, representing the results of a work which extended over nearly two years of experimentation, is the first of a series of such studies and deals with the ubiquitous and harmful nodular worm, Oesophagostomum. This parasite is also important from an economic viewpoint in respect of emaciating the cattle or making their intestines nodular and unfit for sausages. The need, therefore, for a study of this nature has been indeed great. HISTORICAL Oesophagostomes have been known to attack man, monkeys, camel, pig, cattle, sheep and goats, practically all over the earth, and are of the follow- ing species : O. dentatum (Rudolphi 1803 ), O. longicaudum ( Goodey 1925 ), O. apiostomum (Willach 1891), O. brumpti (Railliet and Henry 1905), O. stephanostomum ( Stossich 1904), O. columbianum (Curtice 1890 ), 0. venu- losum ( Rudolphi 1809 ), O. asperum ( Railliet and Henry 1913 ), O. radiatum ( Rudolphi 1803 ) and O. multifoliatum ( 1933). On making a general survey of the life-histories of Oesophagostomes, it is found that Oesophagostomum apiostomum of man and monkeys was studied by Walker in 1913. Weinberg [ 1908] and Thomas [ 1910 ] observed that the larva was carried by blood to the wall of the small intestine, where it escaped from the blood-vessel, encysted in the sub-mucosa, in the internal or external muscularis, or in the sub-peritoneal space, and there grew into the 87
88 Oesophagostomum radiatum immature adult. Walker raises the questions whether the eggs are laid in the intestine of the host or after the worm has been passed in the faeces; whether they develop inside the intestine or outside ; whether there is a free -swimming larva and whether another host is necessary. The early develop- ment and the first-stage and infective larvæ are described, the latter having been observed to have a filiform tail and a zigzag intestinal lumen. ' The larval development of O. apiostomum, therefore, is strikingly similar to and wholly comparable with the development of Ankylostoma duodenale, which is perhaps to be expected from the somewhat near relationship of the two worms. From this similarity in the development of the larva one would expect by ana- logy that the method of entrance of the larva into the body of the host would also be similar'. Veglia [ 1923 ] published his results on Oesophagostomum columbianum in sheep, forming the most important work on the life-history of an oesopha- gostome. He distinguished five stages with four ecdyses, the third stage being infective and the fifth the adult. The larvæ hatch out of the eggs in seven to twenty hours, the first-stage larva lasts for nearly 24 hours and the second-stage larva three days. The infective larvae normally attack the large intestine, emerge from the nodules on the sixth day after ingestion, complete the fourth ecdysis by the 26th day and grow into the adult by the 30th day. Thus, the parasitic stages are developed ex- clusively in the intestine and the larvae do not pursue a migratory course in the blood-stream. He says ' the larvæ of Oesophagostomum exhibit the same phenomenon of thigmotropism, heliotropism, geotropism, and hydrotropism, already described for those of Haemonchus contortus. The resistance of the former to external conditions in the open also shows no marked difference to that previously reported for the latter '. Of the development of the free-living larvæ of Oesophagostomum dentatum from the pig, Goodey [ 1924] gave a summarized description, with no indica- tion of the rate of growth. In their morphology, the larvæ agree with those of O. columbianum, and in their reactions to the surroundings they have been shown to be positively geotropic, resistant to desiccation for one or two days and exhibiting no marked positive thermotropism. The same author [ 1926 ] made a study of the parasitic stages of the para- site inside the pig, and records the interesting observation that no nodules in the intestine were seen by him, even in heavy infections. Descriptions of the early third-stage and the fourth-stage larvæ, including the metamor- phosis into the adult with special reference to the buccal capsule and sexual organs, are given. A report by Veglia [ 1928 ] on Oesophagostomiasis in sheep due to Oeso- phagostomum columbianum was an exposition of the method of artificial infection, cultivation of larvæ and an analysis of the disease. The life of the worms in the host has been judged to last 20 months. The symptoma- tology and therapy of the disease form the larger portion of the paper. Spindler [ 1933 ] obtained infective larvæ of O. longicaudum by culturing eggs on moist sterile soil for five to seven days, and infected pigs with them. Their resemblance to those of O. dentatum is recorded by him. The fourth- stage larvæ and the adult are described in detail, much emphasis being laid
M. ANANTARAMAN 89 on the evolution of the generative system. In two of the animals so infected, the eggs appeared in the fæces on the 50th day and in a third did not appear till the 53rd day. The histopathology of the intestinal tissues is also dealt with. The nodules which were undergoing necrosis showed a diminution in size and in inflammation after the emergence of the fourth-stage larvæ, and disappeared in 35 days. With the material obtained by Veglia for his studies on O. columbianum, Fourie [ 1936] investigated the pathology and pathogenesis of the disease. Enriched by a set of illustrations of a high order, the paper deals with every stage in the formation of the nodule and the reactions of the intestinal tissues to the entry of the larvæ. In his ' Parasites and parasitic diseases of domesticated animals ' Neu- mann [ 1892 ] mentions Drechsler's discovery, as far back as 1876, of some 450 nodules of varying sizes beneath the mucous membrane of the intestines of an ox, most of which had caseated. ' Spherical in shape, and well-defined, they were composed of strong fibrous tissue, and each contained an undetermined nematode90 Oesophagostomum radiatum now not to happen. Whether the larva in the South African cattle was that of O. inflatum or O. radiatum he could not decide, but inclines to the view that it may be the latter. He regards that the disease is not as grave in Africa as in France, since many cattle slaughtered in the Cape had innumerable nodules in the intestines though having been seemingly healthy before death. This is attributed to the variation in the intensity of the infection or the degree of resistance of the host. Bontz and Krause [ 1930], according to Monnig [1933], mentioned intus- susception as one of the effects of the nodular verminosis in bovines, with which Monnig disagrees, and concluded that the causal larvæ were those of Bunostomum in view of the occurrence in them of a large buccal capsule with teeth at the base and an anteriorly situated vulva. To disillusion this, Monnig obtained larvæ from similar nodules and after a comparison with the larvæ of O. columbianum in sheep [ Veglia, 1923] placed the former under Oesphagos- tomum, and even suggested the species as O. radiatum. He explained that the vulva noticed by them behind the M. ANANTARAMAN 91 (2) The petri-dish method This has proved to be better than the glass-jar method, in being handy and in respect of the collection of larvæ being easier and in clean water. Two large petri-dishes of the same size and a third smaller one are necessary. The bottom of the small dish is lined with damp blotting paper and the broken fæces spread on it. This is then placed in one of the large dishes and the intermediate space filled with distilled water. The other dish is placed over these to prevent evaporation, and the entire apparatus placed in a cool por- tion of the room. Under ideal conditions, the infective larvæ scale over the edge of the small dish at the end of the fourth day and migrate into the water- jacket. All the larv æ can then be pipetted off this dish into another for examination. (3) Distilled water Fertilized eggs of O. radiatum were obtained from dung or by opening gravid females, and when left in this medium to develop segmented and hatched into the first-stage larvæ in nearly 20 hours. The larvæ lived for a while and died for want of food. (4) An emulsion of fæces Cleavage and hatching were accomplished and development up to the early second stage was possible, as food was available. But further growth was arrested since the first ecdysis could not be undergone in a fluid medium. (5) Agar inoculated with B. coli Since the agar had to be of a viscous consistency, 20 per cent agar was dissolved in three parts of water and autoclaved. A loop of B. coli was sown into the medium and the agar incubated for at least six hours. First-stage larvæ hatched in distilled water or fæcal emulsion, or eggs from female worms or dung were placed in a watch-glass containing this agar and covered. Normal development followed and infective larvæ were observed at the end of the fourth day. The bacteria serve as food, and ecdysis is possible by reason of the viscosity of the medium. Microscopic examination is facilitated as the activity of the larvæ is restricted in this. The preparation of the drench.92 Oesophagostomum radiatum Care of the host.M.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. An unfertilized egg with polar bodies. 94 Oesophagostomum radiatum The further growth of the egg into the multi-cellular stage is completed while the egg is being transported with the dung to the outside. If conditions are favourable, the morula-stage is reached in nearly 2½ hours after expulsion (Fig. 5). The blastomeres undergo repeated division and individual cells cannot be distinguished. The egg-shell now widens to accommodate the growing embryo. Segmentation has been total and is unequal hereafter. At one pole, the proliferation of cells progresses at a faster pace than at the other, and the resultant embryo attains the typical tadpole-stage with a broad anterior and narrow posterior region, in five to six hours after evacua- tion with the dung (Fig. 6). The surface of the embryo is coarse and there is a pronounced bilateral symmetry in the organogeny. By a process of growth in length and diminution in width the embryo acquires an almost uniform thickness. Being longer than the long axis of the egg-shell this lies bent into two (Fig. 7). Movement to and fro inside the shell is commenced. Growth in length progresses and the head, body and tail end of the vermiform embryo could be identified. The larva is coiled in various patterns, the anterior end is rounded and broad, and the tail long and attenuated. There is an incessant activity inside the shell when seven to eight hours old and no internal struc- ture is evident except clusters of granules. In about 10 hours, the buccal cavity appears as two parallel lines behind the mouth, the M. ANANTARAMAN 95 0.015 to 0.02 mm.; the tip of the tail is 0.12 mm. away from the anus. The cuticle or skin is thin, transversely striated and projects on the sides from the oephalic region to a little posterior to the anus as the lateral lines which bear a sharp edge. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 9. First-stage larva, soon after hatching, showing attenuated tail, rhabditoid 96 Oesophagostomum radiatum The mouth is a narrow aperture at the rounded anterior end and leads into a short buccal cavity, 0.01 mm. long and which could be distinguished as two dark parallel lines. This is continued as the M. ANANTARAMAN 97 stage of intense activity when the larva feeds and prepares for further growth and extends to nearly 12 hours after hatching. All on a sudden, the larva discontinues its movements and undergoing drastic changes lies extended and apparently lifeless. It is not unusual to mistake such larvæ for dead ones but their true condition may be judged by their unwilling movements when disturbed in water on a slide. This lethargic state involves a metamorphosis of the larva into the next stage. All the organs appear faint, the intestinal cells lose their outline and the lumen is not so conspicuously wavy as before. The purpose of this lethargy is fulfilled when a new skin with its lateral lines is differentiated as a striated layer below the existing one, the 98 Oesophagostomum radiatum 35 hours after the first ecdysis or about the close of the third day of develop- ment. The features of the slumbering larva are that a fresh skin is being separated all round the body, the buccal cavity is narrowed to a slender line, the M. ANANTARAMAN 99 and the intestinal cells become indefinite in outline. The larva enters the third stage thereafter. The third-stage larva Reviving from the quiescence, the larva attains the third free-swimming stage, when a moulting has occurred but no ecdysis. The old skin is retained [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 11. Third-stage or infective larva. Strongyliform 100 Oesophagostomum radiatum for the protection of the larva, the ecdysis being delayed till the larva reaches the host. The body resembles that of the second stage in being nearly uni- form in width and measures 0.820 to 0.885 mm. long including the tail and .03 mm. broad. Of this length, the tail occupies about 0.208 mm. (Fig. 11). The old skin or the sheath is somewhat loose and clearly shows the trans- verse striations. The opening in the sheath corresponding to the mouth of the larva is closed. The cuticle of the larva is newly formed beneath the sheath and is also ringed. There are prominent lateral lines, one on each side and correspondingly on the inside there are lateral bands projecting into the body cavity. The mouth is bounded by three lips which close it. There is a triradiate cuticular design in the region of the buccal capsule. The buccal capsule is extremely narrow and insignificant, and its length is reduced to 0.013 mm. The M. ANANTARAMAN 101 Repeated observations on the infective larvæ collected and stocked in bottles of distilled water revealed that the larvæ were gaining a transparency, after sometime, due to the expenditure of the reserve food-granules in the in- testinal cells. To determine whether this was caused by the absence of food in the distilled water or by the cessation of the feeding activity of the larvæ, the following experiment was conducted. 12-2-40 Larvæ collected about 15-1-40 in distilled water, and very transparent, were picked and transferred to (i) a watch glass containing fæcal emulsion, and (ii) another containing agar with B. coli. 13-2-40 to 16-2-40 In both, larvæ were still transparent, and no appearance of food-granules in the intestine was noticed. In spite of the fact that food-material was made available, the larvæ did not show any indication of having fed on it. Morevover, the closed nature of the mouth and anus definitely proves that feeding is suspended during this stage. THE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE Air The presence of air is one of the chief requirements for the successful development of eggs and larvæ. This fact is evident when eggs fail to flourish if air is expelled in a culture by compressing the dung into a cake or by making a paste of it with water. The quantity of air necessary appears to be very small as development is not retarded when small tubes, petri-dishes or bottles containing the fæcal masses remain tightly closed. In support of this argument is the fact that the cleavage of the egg from the four-celled stage in which it is laid by the female in the large intestine of the host to the multicellular stage, proceeds uninterruptedly in the rectum where the supply of air cannot be large. Yet, further development into the larva will not be observed in fæces unduly retained in the rectum as, then, the toxicity caused by the constipation will prove to be injurious to the eggs. It is also not unlikely that an aeration of eggs to a greater degree than the minimum will accelerate the rate of their development. So, this may be offered as an explanation for the unequal development noticed in the different regions of the fæcal pellets. Moisture For normal cleavage and larvation, the fæces should be moist, as much as it would be when evacuated by a healthy host, and this condition is fulfilled, in the laboratory cultures by placing a damped filter-paper below the dung and preventing vaporization, and in the field probably by rain or dew. When fæcal pellets thrown in the open were not moistened frequently, eggs were noticed to be killed. An excess of water delays or stops growth. When the fæces is left soaking in water or mixed with water, the eggs do not hatch, or the hatched larvæ are killed soon after. This is the result of the expulsion of the air by the water and the consequent denseness of fæcal particles. No development was observed in tubes in which the dung was immersed in water.
102 Oesophagostomum radiatum It should, however, be mentioned that though an abundance of moisture may restrict the development, the eggs are not easily destroyed under such a condition. 1-12-39.

(i) Numerous infective larvæ in water-jacket. (ii) No larva in water-jacket. 13-12-39. (i) Many infective larvæ in water-jacket. (ii) Stray infective larvæ in water-jacket. Till 5-12-39, when the dung was wet and soaking in water, the eggs re- mained in their segmentation stages, and as the moisture eventually evaporated and the fæces reached its normal consistency from the 5th onwards, infective larvæ developed and migrated into the water-jacket as in the healthy culture. Moisture is of paramount importance for migration of the infective larvæ, in the soil or elsewhere. When normal petri-dish cultures are left uncovered, the infective larvae do not emigrate into the surrounding water because the evaporated water is not allowed to condense on the sides of the petri-dish with fæces. Nevertheless, when a dish was later placed as a cover over the same culture, the larvæ were found in the water-belt the next day. A small dish of distilled water containing infective larvæ was provided with a belt of water in a larger dish and covered. Daily observations were made for about a fortnight and no larva was seen in the outer dish. Infective larvæ, therefore, do not emigrate when they are already in a fluid medium. Desiccation Moisture being so essential for the development of the eggs and the migra- tion of the infective larvæ, the effects of desiccation should be expected to be highly harmful (by ' desiccation ' it being meant natural drying and not extraction of moisture by chemical agents). In general, the state of complete dryness may be very easily reached in the pastures exposed to the summer temperature, and much less inside cattle-yards and such protected places. Edges of pools and lakes, the tilled field and the like are considered the most favourable localities for developing eggs and larvæ where drying is obviated to a certain degree by virtue of percolating moisture.

Infective stage is attained by the larvæ in (b) and (c) in a somewhat longer time than in the control. Because of exposure to the air, larvæ have been killed in the early stages in dry pellets of (c). Eggs situated in the superficial area of the dung pellets are more liable to be killed by drying than those in the interior, unless water was sprinkled on the pellets frequently. No larva was found to have ascended the grass. Experiment II.104 Oesophagostomum radiatum number of larvæ reviving diminishes and the period for reviviscence increases, as days pass by. Experiment III.M. ANANTARAMAN 105 ment, while 105°F. and over will be beyond the limits of endurance. Cor- respondingly a lower temperature usually delays development, but excessive cold will result in the annihilation of eggs or larvæ. When pellets of fæces are exposed to the sun for a few hours everyday, the development of eggs in them is more rapid than in the Laboratory cultures. But, prolonged exposure causes desiccation and death. Experiment I.106 Oesophagostomum radiatum not developed beyond the second stage, they were actively feeding and swim- ming and appearing healthy. Culture (a) continued to show infective larvæ everyday thereafter, while in (b) were dead larvæ, and in (c) infective stage was attained on the 5th day. It will be seen that direct sunlight is deleterious to the life of these larvæ according to the observations on (b), and that a layer of soil over the mass of dung lends enough protection to the latter against the sun for the infective stage to be reached successfully, though later than in the ideal culture (a). In this experiment it was on the 5th day while on another occasion it was on the 7th day. This feature is particularly interesting in view of such a protection being given, in nature, by accumulating waste-matter over the excrement in the streets, and in the open spaces and fields by the overturning of soil, to a very great extent by tillage and to some degree by earthworms, mole-crickets, dung-rollers and termites. Within the cattle-yard, dung may be heaped up in places, or the animals may cover the dung with mud or sand by kicking up the ground. It may be expected that development would proceed normally in the shade. Even here it matters much whether the shade is always available at the spot or not. Together with warmth, exposure to breeze also acts to drive the moisture off the dung. When a fæcal pellet was thrown at the root of a large tree where no sunlight fell at any part of the day, and moistened frequently only dead larvæ were found in three to four days, whereas, a similar pellet placed between the bases of shrubs forming a thick hedge and moistened like-wise revealed infective larvæ a little later than usual, by reason of the greater humidity present there than at the base of a tree. Dung containing eggs of O. radiatum was cultured in three petri-dishes, to one of which was added powdered charcoal to prevent fermentation in the heat of the incubator. 26-8-40.

Apparently, an exposure to 45°C. even for a part of the day is destructive. Eggs of the worm were cultured in the dung in three petri-dishes, one placed on the table at room temperature, and the other two inside an incubator at 60° and 50°C. respectively, for only two hours each day on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th days. On the fifth day, infective larvæ were present in the first culture and none in those subjected to the heat. The infective larvæ detest heat and inhume themselves in the innermost recesses of the excremental pellets or in the soil during the hot hours of the day, and ascend to the surface in the early hours of the morning. They react positively to a moderate heat and avoid excess of it. When a highly heated section-lifter is brought near the edge of a watch-glass con- taining them, they immediately congregate near that edge in response to the radiating warmth, while on the other hand they retreat to the opposite side if
M. ANANTARAMAN 107 the metal is placed on the watch glass for sometime and the heat conducted to the water. Their activity is increased when the water is slightly warm, but when moved over a flame or exposed to the sun for long they die out- stretched. Light Dull light, as exists in a cloudy weather and at twilight, or darkness is the most conducive to the normal development of the eggs. Bright light, to the degree of being a glare, results in delayed cleavage and hatching and sometimes in the death of the first-stage larvæ. The effect of direct sunlight cannot be said to be exclusive, since a higher temperature and absence of moisture exert their influence collateral with the sun's light. Growth progress- es when there is minimization of direct sunlight by covering the fæcal mass with loose soil or by leaving the pellets under a hedge where shade is continuous. Toxic substances It frequently happens that consequent to some disturbance in the host, there are present toxins in its fæces which have an untoward influence on the eggs imbedded in the dung. Foul-smelling, diarrh108 Oesophagostomum radiatum water, in any of the above concentrations, will not have a detrimental effect on them. The same experiment was repeated on 25 November 1940, with higher concentrations, (a) 0.5 in 1,000 (6) 1 in 1,000 and (c) 2 in 1,000. The observa- tions were:M. ANANTARAMAN 109 Though Izal and copper sulphate in the proportions mentioned above were found to destroy the larvæ when they were directly placed in them, the foregoing experiment proves how ineffective they are when mixed with the fæoes. The ostensible reason is that the chances of the larvæ coming in contact with the solutions are reduced, due either to the insufficiency of the solutions or to the solutions percolating down rapidly leaving the upper pellets of the fæces unaffected. Assuming that 10 c.c. of the above solutions for every 20 grams of fæces would be a fair proportion, a similar experiment was started on 8 January 1941. On the. 13th, infective larvæ were present in all the water-jackets except that of (d) in which lactophenol was employed, but on the 14th a very small number of them appeared in (d) also. Thus, none but lactophenol has any effect when mixed with the fæces. Twenty-five grams of the same fæces were mixed with the following and cultured, on 18 February 1941. (a) 5 c.c. distilled water. (b) 5 c.c. 3 per cent hydrochloric acid. (c) 5 c.c. 3 per cent sodium hydroxide. (d) 10 c.c. 3 per cent hydrochloric acid. (e) 10 c.c. 3 per cent sodium hydroxide. (f) 5 c.c. 2 per cent formalin. On 25 February 1941, infective larvæ were observed in all except (e) and (f). It was also noted, in passing, that in no culture was any fungus found to have grown. Five cultures of the dung were made in this manner on 17 January 1941 :110 Oesophagostomum radiatum The migration of infective larvæ The larvæ having reached the infective stage show a tendency to leave the fæces in which they develop by virtue of a migratory instinct they possess. When the fæces are surrounded by water, as in a petri-dish culture, they crawl up the edge of the inner dish and swim vigorously on reaching the water. They also likewise move towards the soil, if the dung happens to be laid on it. Migration is hindered if the fæces is not spread uniformly. If in the inner; petri-dish, the dung is placed in the middle so as not to touch the sides, the larvæ experience difficulty in crossing the surrounding space to reach the edge of the dish and get entangled in the fluff of the blotting-paper. Apart from this instinctive migration their movements are governed by external conditions as moisture, temperature, light,etc. With an increase in temperature they attempt to protect themselves from drying by concealment at the bases of grasses or by burrowing the soil if the latter is moist. Hydrotropism. M. ANANTARAMAN 111 gible extent and, as would be seen from an experiment described below, the larvæ confine themselves to the soil-surface if there is even a film of water. Dispersal could therefore be made possible by water running on the pastures and fields. Fæcal pellets placed on soil and moistened frequently show infective larvæ as usual, which sooner or later migrate into the soil right below the fæces. Such larvæ have been noticed to burrow into the soil, exposed to the sun, etc. to a depth of 2 inches (5 cm.) as in the case of the infective larvæ of Hæmonchus contortus [Veglia, 1915]. Experiment I.112 Oesophagostomum radiatum particles. No larvæ were present in some due, presumably, to a close texture of the soil, where the number of pore-spaces will vary inversely with the density It is obvious that in clayey soil this migration will be impossible. Experiment III.M. ANANTARAMAN 113 With regard to the possibility of cutaneous infection with these larvæ, reference has to be made to a study by Mayhew [1939] on the mode of infection of Bunostomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum in cattle. The method he adopted to make the infective larvæ come in contact with skin was to throw the calf on one side, tie its legs firmly, pour the water containing the larvæ in small quantities on the unshaven skin of the flank and work the larvæ into the hair for some time. By pressing the hand on the portion of the body for about half an hour warmth was preserved. The calf was then placed for varying periods in a stanchion where it could not turn and lick its body. Of five experiments performed under these conditions with O. radiatum four resulted in successful cutaneous infection. It should be agreed with him that ' oral infection by licking the hair contaminated with larvæ in the bedding places does not seem to have been considered by livestock owners, veterina- rians, and research workers, even though it is well known that cattle constantly lick themselves and one another'. From his observation that the larvæ are able to thrive among the hairs of the calf for at least a week, it could be imagined how great the opportunities are, for an infestation by licking the body and how effectively the shaded areas of the cattle-yard would serve as sources of infection. Parasitic life The second half of the third-stage larva, the fourth-stage larva and the fifth-stage or adult are parasitic. On arrival in the intestine the second ecdysis is undergone, the exsheathed third-stage larva bores the wall of the small intestine and forms a nodule. The larva continues to be recognized as the third-stage larva inside the cyst until after a time when the third ecdysis is achieved and the fourth-stage is attained. Some days later, the fourth- stage larva returns to the intestinal lumen, and while moving across the caecum sheds the cuticle for a fourth time, takes its permanent position in the large intestine as the adult, matures and oviposits. The parasitic third-stage larva The second ecdysis which should have marked the transition from the second to the third (infective) stage occurs when the infective larvæ reach the small intestine. In a white-mouse, to which 400 larvæ were administered and which was killed seven hours after, 50 per cent of the larvæ were divested of the sheath as a result of the second ecdysis, in the small intestine. The ex- sheathed larva resembled the infective larva proper inside the sheath (Fig. 12.) The larva had grown and measured 0.76 mm. long as compared to 0.68 mm. inside the sheath. The 114 Oesophagostomum radiatum measured 0.018 mm. in length. When neutral red was applied the larva did not absorb it. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 12. Larva in the third parasitic stage, recently exsheathed in the intestine of a mouse, resembling the infective larva in all characters except the posses- sion of a sheath. These exsheathed third-stage larvæ move towards the intestinal wall and penetrate into it through the mucous membrane causing extensive lesions and destruction of villi. The penetration is usually completed in about 30 hours, but in rare cases (Plate IX, fig. 6), as in calf No. 10, the larva is seen to enter the mucosa only after three days. This penetration is recognized

PLATE X FIG. 1. Section of a nodule in the ileum of calf No. 5, where the nodule is advanced in growth, and the third-stage larva seen inside the cyst. Note the destruction of the villi in the central M. ANANTARAMAN 115 by Fourie [1936] as ' primary parasitic migration'. The larva does not proceed beyond the sub-mucosa, where it forms a cyst located against the muscularis mucosa (Plate IX, fig. 8). The cyst projects into the intestinal lumen as a nodule. The encysted larvæ, invariably lie in a coiled state inside the cyst and undergo rapid development (Plate X, fig. 1). Such a larva obtained from a nodule 43 hours old has the following features :116 Oesophagostomum radiatum The mouth is open and bounded by three lips, each of which is a triangular, leaf-like structure with a pointed tip. In some specimens these were observed to be apposed together to close the oral aperture. There is a very short and narrow buccal capsule, whose sides are not so heavily chitinised as before. The M.

ANANTARAMAN 119 third stage has somewhat shifted to the posterior end on the ventral side, is longer and is composed of more cells, about 8 in number. It is a cylindrical structure, shows a beaded appearance and ends somewhere in front of the rectal ligaments. Lying free in the coelomic cavity between the ventral body- muscles and the intestine it awaits further development into uterus, ovary, etc In the potential male, the tail does not extend from the anus as much as in the female, and ends abruptly with a truncated appearance on the ventral side. The tip is swollen as a knob as in the other. The internal genitalia are in two sets, one a linear and narrow cellular organ, in the ventral region of the coelom between the intestine and the body-wall and beginning from behind the posterior end of the cervical gland runs till the rectal region to ultimately grow into testis, etc. The other is a cluster of cells wedged between the dorsal coelomic wall and the rectum and destined to be the precursor of the spicular structures of the adult. Development of the larva does not progress any further unless the larva pierces the nodule ('secondary parasitic migration') and emerges into the lumen of the intestine. This period of intra-nodular life seems to be influenced by various conditions and therefore differs with individuals. In calf No. 3 which was killed on the 7th day after a drench of 3000 infective larvæ, the fourth-stage larva had migrated into the intestinal lumen from the nodules, and in calf No. 5 which was destroyed on the 9th day after an intake of larvæ, a few fourth-stage larvæ were observed to have travelled to the caecum and colon on that day, and naturally emergence should have been sometime before that. It can therefore be concluded that the larvæ normally leave the nodules on the eighth day. There was an instance of aberrant nodular life in calf No. 11 about 2000 infective larvæ were orally administered to this animal on 19 August 1940 and the animal died on 22 October 1940, nearly two months after. The autopsy revealed that of the 2000 larvæ more than a hundred had grown into adults in 64 days, whereas the rest were arrested in the nodules of the Ileum as fourth-stage larvæ. The duration of nodular existence is thus seen to be variable, not only in different calves but for different larvæ of the same lot as well. The escaped larvæ continue to be in the fourth-stage for some more days although the development towards the adult condition progresses rapidly meanwhile. Figs. 17 and 18 are of the posterior regions of a male and a female larva recently arrived in the intestine from the nodule. In the male, the tail has assumed a more truncate appearance and the genital rudiment is long and is divisible into a posterior thickened region with a number of cells and an anterior narrow one with a linear set of cells reaching near the cervical gland. In the neighbourhood of the rectum and dorsal to it is the serially disposed cells of the spicule-apparatus. In the female, the tail is conical and tapering and much longer than that of the male. The anus is situated 0.12 mm. from the knobbed tip, and the female genital organ in front of the termi- nation of the intestine. There is a bulbous structure showing indications of developing into the future ovijector, from which is an anterior extension of cells in two rows for a distance of 0.04 mm. the fore-runner of the uterus120 Oesophagostomum radiatum ovary. In all other respects, the larvæ in this stage resemble the fourth- stage larvæ inside the nodule, still retaining the provisional ankylostomiform or cupoliform, monodonted buccal capsule and a feeble cervical cuticular inflation (Fig. 16).

The caudal region of the same larva, a potential male, with the spicular appara- tus dorsal to the intestine and the two rows of cells forming the testis. One more ecdysis and the adult stage is attained. The ecdysis involves a separation, as usual, of the outermost skin from the larva beginning from the anterior end and culminating in the posterior region, around the bursa in the male and the long tail of the female. Calf No. 3 which was infected with 2000 larvæ on 29 February 1940 was destroyed on 29 March 1940, i.e. after an interval of 28 days and 19 hours. A number of fourth-stage larvæ were present in the lumen of the colon and among them were some which had completed the fourth ecdysis and were undergoing maturation. Some others were only then metamorphosing into the fifth stage and the majority had not exsheathed for the fourth time. From this it may be approximately calculated that the transformation into the adult after the fourth ecdysis takes place about the 28th day. In Fig. 19, the structural organization of the head of a larva some time before ecdysis is indicated. The noteworthy feature is that the definitive M. ANANTARAMAN 121 posterior limit of the ankylostomiform capsule and the anterior end of the 122 Oesophagostomum radiatum The larvæ undergoing these changes gradually migrate down the ileum and caecum and reach the colon which is the habitat of the adult worm.

In calf No. 4, to which repeated doses of infective larvæ of 0. radiatum were administered from 16 October 1939, infective larvæ were trapped for the first time in the water-jacket of a culture of faeces passed on the 41st day after the first drench. Again calf No. 11 swallowed infective larvæ on 19 August 1940 and the first occasion when infective larvæ were obtained was from the fæces passed on 14 September 1940, i.e. the 26th day after ingestion. This is a surprisingly short period as compared to the previous record of 41 days and to the smallest period, viz. 38 days, in the case of O. columbianum. It may be presumed that in O. columbianum [Veglia, 1928] records the ' first appearance of eggs in the faeces '. and not the first occurrence of infective larvæ in it, and as it has been experienced that eggs in the fæces may be missed in the early stages on account of their scantiness, it is possible that Veglia would have recorded the first appearance of the eggs earlier if he had cultured the faeces, to look for the infective larvæ, and not examined them for eggs, as is apparent. The fully-developed worms are easily distinguished into males and female even with the naked eye, and mostly have a hooked anterior end. The male
M. ANANTARAMAN 125 are generally smaller than the females the average length of a male being 17.1 mm. and that of a female 19.7 mm. In the mature or gravid worms the head (Fig. 23) shows an oral cuticular collar appearing as two vesicles on the sides of the mouth, six papillae round the mouth, a much dilated and conspicuous cephalic vesicle and a deep cervical groove on both the dorsal and ventral sides taking an anterior bend on the lateral lines. The lateral alae begin behind this indentation and are pierced by the cervical papilla near that region. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 23. The head of an adult.

128 Oesophagostomum radiatum THE PARASITISM The nodules From the foregoing account, it follows that the infective larvæ cause nodules in the sub-mucosa of the ileum on their entry into the wall, live inside them for some days and retrace their steps to the intestinal cavity as different larvæ. The nodule so produced is a hard globular structure visible in most cases even from the outside. Its size ranges from that of a pin-head to that of a pea, and growth to the latter size is very rapid. A section of a nodule on the 2nd day is shown in Plate X, fig. 2, where below the mucosa, is formed a cyst enclosing the larva. The cyst is shown under higher magnification in Plate X, fig. 3, with the larva cut in three places. The structure of the cyst wall has been discussed by Fourie [1936] and Spindler [1933]. This cyst-wall stains well with Eosin and does not reveal any cellular structure, nor is there any striation to indicate that it was formed from the old skin of the larva [Fourie, 1936]. Spindler [1933] argues that it may be formed from a coagulum due to a liquefying process during the necrosis caused by the larvæ. Fourie's objection to it, that the appearance is not that of a coagulated mass but of a bundle of fine thread-like structures, is supported in the case of the nodules in cattle also. The nature of the cyst-wall therefore remains undetermined. In nodules which are more than three days old, a light-green cheesy substance is obtained on opening them and the fourth-stage larvæ are usually detected inside them. As a result of the severe necrosis undergone by the tissues, a process of caseation takes place in the centre of the nodule and this region is noticed in sections of older nodules as a central, densely staining mass of cells (Plate X, fig. 4). These nodules are also known to calcify after many days. Calf No. 2 which had an infection of 1500 larvæ on 12 September 1939, revealed only four nodules in the ileum on 14 May 1940, so that the rest of the nodules may be said to have disappeared in that period of eight months, leaving no macroscopic traces of their existence. It has been consistently recorded that in cattle the nodules are caused in the ileum of the host. While it is now realized to be the case in mild infections, in heavy infestations other regions of the alimentary canal are also attacked. Larvæ as many as 3000 and 4000 were administered to calves Nos. 3 and 10 respectively in a single drench and nodules were also present in the caecum and a portion of the colon. The locus of parasitization may therefore extend to the posterior portions also if the dosage is large and in a single instalment, for in calf No. 4 which had about 10,200 larvæ in many instalments nodules were however restricted only to the ileum. Longevity of adults Oesophagostomum columbianum according to Veglia [1928] can live in the intestines of sheep for 20-21 months or even longer. The maximum duration of the infestation by O. radiatum is unknown, as in no case did the host survive so long. Calf No. 2 received a dose of larvæ on 12 September 1939 and till its death on 14 May 1940 (8 months) eggs of the worm were being expelled. Calf No. 8 had an infection of the worm at the time of its purchase on 23 April 1940 and gave evidences of it for the 6 months it lived after that. Calf
M. ANANTARAMAN 129 No. 13 also infected likewise previous to 23 October 1940 continues to dis- charge eggs to this day, 9 June 1941. In artificial infections, the same technique as was employed for 0. columbianum was adopted here. Both gradual and sudden infections were caused and the calf that took superimposed doses of larvæ died sooner than the one which had an intake of larvæ in one instalment. Death of the host may be due to two varieties of 130 Oesophagostomum radiatum The various stages of the worm bear a close resemblance to the corres- ponding stages in the other species of Oesophagostomum, the development of which is so far known, in development, structure and behaviour. Below is an analytical chart to compare the rate of growth in and the measurements of the free-living stages of five species of Oesophagostomum.

The area affected is under develop- ment for the increased cultivation of paddy and sugarcane and is situated between the left bank of the canal and the river Manjra including the taluqs of Banswada, Bodhan, Armur and Nizamabad of Nizamabad district. The area fed by the Pocharam canal comprises villages in Medak and Yellareddi taluqs of Medak district. Besides, sheep at Hingoli and cattle at Himayat- sagar farm have been shown to be affected and infestation has also been con- firmed in the districts of Aurangabad, Warangal, Nalgonda, Mahabubnagar, Asifabad, Hyderabad and Atrafbalda. Most of the material for the article is the result of systematic survey carried out in twenty-four villages in Nizamsagar area and four villages in Pocharam area and of experimental control measures applied in two selected villages during 1937 and 1938. It is noted that the villages most affected by liver fluke in Nizamsagar have the smallest number of cattle. This is due to mortality from this pest. Therefore, for effecting any improvement in quality and number of cattle in the area, the control of this parasitic infestation is of paramount importance. METHODS OF WORK (a) Collection of flukes from slaughter houses and at post-mortem examination of animals. (b) Study of causes of water-logging. (c) Collection of snails from the known infected areas, their identifica- tion and study of cercarial fauna. (d) Clinical diagnosis of distomiasis in animals with microscopic con- firmation by examination of fæces as a routine. (e) Study of treatment and control measures. VILLAGES SURVEYED The following twenty-one villages and three hamlets beginning from the Nizamsagar reservoir in Banswada taluq were visited during this investigation covering twenty miles of the canal and twenty distributaries. The canal is ninty-six miles in length and has eighty-two distributaries.

M. R. MAHAJAN 135 The villages surveyed in Pocharam canal area were ; Atmakur, Pocharam, Nagareddi and Malthumida. Pocharam was incidently the first in the canal areas that attracted the attention of the Veterinary Department in 1931. DETERIORATION OF STOCK AND ITS CAUSES Before the Nizamsagar project came into existence it is said that the area with low hill ranges was full of forests and was a good breeding tract for Malvi cattle. The breeders (Lambadas) had settled there and even animals from other parts of the country were brought there during the season for grazing.

In addition to canal water supply to the villages surveyed as per Table II, during the rainy season water flows from the hilly area on the right bank of the canal through the under bridges into the low-lying area. All along the canal there are pits on the left bank excavated for making the canal bank, and stagnant pools form here due to percolation of water from the canal. The distributaries and field channels, the tank, big and small, together with many ditches and pools found in each village, make the whole area water- logged, damp and swampy, with the result that very favourable conditions exist for the propagation of the fluke through water snails which have ample opportunities for development. Hon'ble the Revenue Member in 1938 wrote regarding water-logging as follows :Indian J. Vet. Sci. & Anim.

Knowing little about the life-history of the parasite, he blames the eating of tunga as its cause. This of course is caused by the ingestion of meta-cercariæ that are deposited on tunga. The effect and severity of disease due to fluke infestation depend largely upon the number of parasites present in the liver, and therefore the symptoms and the course of the disease are variable, lasting from six months to a year or so. Animals brought into the area pick up infection usually during and just after the rains and show the first symptoms in about three months, early in winter. These are :M. R. MAHAJAN 141 MICROSCOPIC DETERMINATION OF LIVER FLUKE INFESTATION Table IV gives details about the percentage of infection recorded dur- ing the survey in Nizamsagar and Pocharam canal areas in 1937 :142 Liver Fluke and its Control in Hyderabad State Only ordinary smear method of examination of fæces under field condi- tions was made and results recorded. Had more accurate method of exami- nation been adopted, the results obtained would probably have shown a larger infestation than that recorded. From the microscopical examination of fæces of 299 cattle, 289 buffaloes, 111 sheep and thirty-five goats, 151 cattle, 185 buffaloes, 28 sheep and seven goats were found to be infected with Fasciola gigantica. The results recorded for 28 villages indicate on an average a 50 per cent infection in cattle, 64 per cent in buffaloes, 25 per cent in sheep and 20 per cent in goats. The infestation recorded for cattle and buffaloes is more extensive than in sheep and goats. This is, because the shepherd usually grazes his flock on high lands avoiding marshy and water-logged areas. Even the govern- ment breeding bulls posted in the canal development area suffer from liver fluke infestation and receive continuous attention from the veterinary staff.

For natural grazing government allow animals to be grazed in the forests and hills. Final Report [ 1938 ] of the Punjab Parasitological Research Scheme, financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research concludes, that animals kept on mineral deficient rations are more severely attacked by para- sites and that good food is to a great extent responsible for keeping the para- sites under check. The Veterinary Department is educating ryots by lectures and demonstra- tions at the local shows and by distribution of pamphlets giving salient
M. R. MAHAJAN 143 points and diagrammatic representation of life-history of the liver fluke to all villages, with the result that the villager now knows the relationship between the snails and the fluke disease and thus assists in the control operations. For the control of fluke disease measures have to be adopted on an ex- tensive scale to be effective and this was done in two selected villages on an experimental basis with the following two objects in view :144 Liver Fluke and its Control in Hyderabad State within 10 hours of administration. Further use of this drug from Merck's was stopped and calcium gluconate was kept handy for administration as an antidote. In the liver-rot outbreak encountered amongst sheep at the Hingoli farm, at first treatment was undertaken using extract of male-fern given as an electuary in doses of 1/4 to 1/2 drachm, both as curative and preventive. In spite of this treatment, however, the strength of the flock was reduced from 107 to 97 during the three weeks . After this, carbon tetrachloride in cap- sules was used giving a dose of 0.5 to 0.7 c.c. both as a curative and protective, having first ascertained the idiosyncrasy of the sheep towards this drug. The results obtained from this were encouraging as no fresh attacks occurred in the healthy lot, while only a few, far advanced in disease, succumbed. This was repeated after six weeks to kill all flukes that had matured during the interval. In addition well-water was provided for drinking and the disease was controlled. Yet another drug used in the treatment of infested cattle was Igitol (Bayer). The results of treatment with this were more satisfactory in the sense, that it was quite safe even in milch cattle but the cost is prohibitive for large scale operations. The results of treatment with this drug and carbon tetrachloride were compared when 312 animals were treated with the former and 536 with the latter. At Himayatsagar Dairy Farm, where, out of 323 animals, 50 cows were found positive, Igitol only was used and the results of microscopic examination, a month later, showed only 17 cows still positive. They were given a second course and by preventing these animals gaining access to the infected channel at the Farm the disease was effectively con- trolled. Since, Igitol is not available in the country now and because of its prohi- bitive cost, the only drug now used is carbon tetrachloride. It is desirable that wholesale treatment of sick cattle of affected villages should be carried out with this drug and the operation repeated within two months. To sum up, the treatment of cattle carried out in the affected areas during the past four years, showed improvement in the general condition of the animals and to support this Table VI from Tirmalapur village is of interest:M. R. MAHAJAN 145 Although the treatment of animals gave encouraging results and the con- dition of the animals had also definitely improved, yet it was realized from the very beginning that this was only tackling one aspect of the problem because the infection being constantly present in the snails, the animals were exposed to re-infection. ERADICATION OF SNAILS The second aspect, which must be taken up simultaneously with treat- ment, is to destroy the intermediary host that harbours cercariæ and rediæ, viz. the snail. Much work on this has been done notably in Australia, United States of America, Yugoslavia and other countries. The main recommenda- tions are :146 Liver Fluke and its Control in Hyderabad State (i) Mechanical removal [ Plate XIV, figs. 1-3 ] For mechanical removal, specially designed wire-gauze nets attached to wooden poles were locally made. Each labourer was provided with one of these and a basket tied to his waist. He was made to wade through the water, catch snails and collect them in his basket. In this manner, all water areas in the two villages were nearly freed from snails. About three to four gunny bags full of live snails were caught and destroyed. As an experiment, wire-gauze screens were provided to the distributaries supplying water from the main canal to these villages. No snails, however, were caught. Closer inspection revealed, that snails as such, did not pass through the water from the canal to the area but only millions of their eggs. (ii) Chemical destruction Rais Jung [ 1932 ] recommends the use of copper sulphate, one part to 500,000-2,000,000 parts of water to kill snails in 24 hours. Bhalerao [ 1933, 2 ] recommends the use of 1 lb. of copper sulphate for 200,000 gallons of water. Out of several chemicals used for destroying snails by Boyet [ 1938 ] in Yugoslavia, copper sulphate was found to be the most effective when sprink- led in 1 per cent solution and he advocated the strength of one part to 20,000 to kill snails in one hour. As no records of practical data were available on the subject in India, the concentration of copper sulphate to be used required a careful consideration. Before taking up spraying work, copper sulphate in a gunny bag was placed in the streams of some villages. A measured quantity was placed in a bag but no appreciable results were, however, obtained. Copper sulphate spraying work was then taken up in all the water-logged areas containing snails [ Plate XV, figs. 1-3] in order to destroy those that were left over after mechanical removal during the operations in two villages in 1938. For spraying purposes, a given quantity of copper sulphate was pow- dered and dissolved in a known quantity of water in a bucket. ' Enotes ' high pressure hyject foot pump which worked up to a distance of 50 ft. was employed to spray this concentrated copper sulphate solution, having worked out roughly the quantity of water containing snails in a given ditch or tank. The usual concentration of copper sulphate employed for spraying work was about 5-6 ounces in a bucket-full (387 ounces) or a 2 per cent solution was used for spraying which killed the snails but not fish. Since most of the water in the area is running water it is difficult to apply this chemical, as the effect usually passes away. Yet another difficulty was the penetration of the drug to the snails which were in tunga ridden water. The snails found in the ditches and small ponds were effectively treated with copper sulphate and even in these places because the tunga and other vegetative growth interfered, a higher percentage of copper sulphate was required to be effective for the purpose, and this worked out to about one pound of the chemical in fifty to seventy thousand gallons of water.

M. R. MAHAJAN 147 Our experience of the use of copper sulphate in the strength of one lb. in a million gallons of water showed a mortality of 60 per cent, 16 hours later. Next day one lb. in 50,000 gallons of water was used and only 29 were found alive out of 353 examined. A few surface fish were also found dead and floating. In other places general mortality of snails noticed after the use of copper sulphate spray was 60 to 70 per cent.

Government was approached to grant a holiday known as ' liver fluke day ' to associate the work of destruction of the snails with what has come to be known as a water hyacinth clearance week, in Nizamabad district. This the Government kindly sanctioned. Rewards are given by the Veterinary Department for destruction of snails on that day. During the year 1939-40, for the first time in the Nizamsagar area, wide- scale anti-snail measures were, therefore, adopted by the district authorities in cooperation with the ryots for two days in April 1939 along with the hya- cinth eradication operation. It was observed that the response was fair, and large numbers of snails were collected and destroyed in a number of villages. The collection showed that the predominating species was Limnæa acuminata in Banswada taluq, next being in Bodhan taluq. The percentage of snails in the tanks varied with water-logging in the area. The collected snails were mixed with quick-lime and buried. These eradication operations are now held as a routine measure annually.

Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bombay and Bacteriologist, Bombay Veterinary College (Received for publication on 11 July 1941) (With one text-figure) INTRODUCTION NASAL granuloma is a disease of great economic importance in as much as it renders working animals quite unfit and useless for work. In certain districts where bullocks fetch very high prices, (e.g. up to Rs. 800 per pair) it causes heavy losses to cattle owners. The distribution of the disease which has been investigated in this province is shown in Fig. 1. It is essentially a disease of endemic nature and the intensity of infestation is the heaviest in the water-logged tracts of Dharwar, Belgaum and North Kanara districts and in Raver taluka of East Khandesh district, where 10 to 20 per cent of cattle population are found affected with the disease and where lakes, ponds and pools of water are abundant and are the only sources of water supply to man and his animals. The ponds which contain water perennially harbour in very large numbers various species of snails, viz. Indoplanorbis exustus, Viviparus dissimilis, Viviparus bengalensis and Limnoea acuminata. Furcocercus cercariae, the immature form of Schistosoma nasalis, the causal parasite of nasal granuloma, are readily recoverable from the snails, Indoplanorbis exustus, which infest these ponds. Cattle pick up infection from pond water infested with these cercariae. The disease is not disseminated from an affected animal to a healthy one by direct contact. It fails to spread in the localities where Indoplanorbis exustus snails are absent although affected animals are moved to such localities. Affected cases discharge ova of Schistosoma nasalis in large numbers through their nasal discharge and infect ponds while drinking water and also continue picking up fresh infection. It is a chronic disease and once an animal gets affected with it recovery is not known to occur spontaneously. The symptoms of the disease are aggravated during the rains and while animals are working ; badly affected bullocks show signs of tympanic condition of the belly and suffocation with a slight exertion when at work. Tartar emetic has been found to be the best drug for effecting cure for this disease when administered intravenously but the computation of dose of the drug and modus operandi of the intravenous therapy were difficult for application on account of the toxicity of the drug and of the enormous swelling often produced by the drug coming in contact with the perivascular tissue while injecting. To prevent this contact about 10 c. c. of sterile normal saline solution is usually injected into the vein through the same needle before it is withdrawn. Rao and Mudaliar [1936] recently contributed a valuable paper 150
R. N. NAIK 151 wherein they recommended, as a safe dose, intravenous injections of 6 per cent antimony tartrate solution either daily for 6 days at 1.5 grains or every al- ternate day for a week at 2.5 grains per 100 lb. body weight. A proprietory drug, Antimosan (Bayer) has also been placed on the market claiming cure [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. F
152 Experiment on the Control of Nasal Granuloma for the disease. It is also known that snails in ponds can be destroyed by dissolving 1 oz. of copper sulphate per 7,800 gallons of water. With a view, therefore, to ascertaining whether it is possible to control nasal granuloma in an infected village by treating affected cases and ponds with the drugs stated above and if so, to what extent this can be effected within a period of one year, this experiment was carried out according to a technical programme approved by the Director of Veterinary Services, Province of Bombay, Poona. VENUE OF THE EXPERIMENT This was Shirbadgi, a village in Haveri taluka, Dharwar district. This village is situated in a valley and has two ponds one called Dodda Honda and another Sanna Honda from which animals are watered. Both these ponds were teeming with Indoplanorbis exustus snails. The cattle population of this village is bout 500 out of which about 115 head of cattle were affected with nasal granuloma. This village was a notorious one for the dissemination of the disease to the cattle of the surrounding villages. I. TREATMENT OF AFFECTED ANIMALS One hundred and seven affected cattle were secured in the village and were divided into five batches, three of which were subjected to the experi- mental treatment with tartar emetic and two with Antimosan. In the first batch which was subjected to the experiment with tartar emetic only 8 cattle were included with a view to testing the safety of the dosage of the drug re- commended by Rao and Mudaliar (loc. cit.) on the cattle of this tract and when these results were available, 34 cattle were included in the second batch and 49 in the third batch. The number of cattle included in the experiment with Antimosan was 6 in the first batch and 10 in the second batch. The body weights of animals to be treated were calculated by the appli- cation of the formula (girth in in.) × length in in./300= weight in lb. History re- garding age, lactation and period of gestation was also recorded prior to the administration of the first injection. Every animal that received the treat- ment was kept under vigilant observation throughout the course of treatment. Owners were also asked to report if animals treated showed any signs of malaise indicating toxicity which, wherever noticed, was promptly treated by administering suitable antidote as stated elsewhere in this article. A. Experiment with tartar emetic A six per cent solution of tartar emetic was freshly prepared every day according to the quantity required. Six daily injections were given at 1.5 grains per 100 lb. body weight as recommended by Rao and Mudaliar [1936] Animals included in the first batch were given these injections in a standing posture but it was found that under field conditions where no trevis is avail- able, animals usually struggled at the time of injection with the results that
R. N. NAIK 153 in a few cases the end of the needle pricked the opposite side of the vein and a drop or two of the solution escaped into the perivascular tissue which was the cause of swelling. So, in the remaining batches every animal was cast and restrained with the help of available cultivators. This change reduced the production of swelling at the seat of injection to a negligible number as noted in Table I.

All treated cases showed an improvement in their body cond- tion and the partially cured cases were also found useful for work for the time being. It is evident, from the large number of animals of different classes included in this experiment and from the consideration of the fact that this experiment
R. N. NAIK 155 has been carried out under field conditions, that the results reported here are more reliable and comprehensive than what is published hitherto on the subject. Although it is efficient in 81.8 per cent of affected cases, the course of treatment recommended by Rao and Mudaliar [ 1936 ] possesses the best practical value so far known but in this course of treatment one should note that toxic symptoms are induced in 13.2 per cent of animals and that about 4 per cent of the total number of cases treated die due to toxicity of the drug. But this number is negligible and the writer's practical experience of field work in this connection shows that cultivators do not get discouraged with this small percentage of deaths and are prepared to risk the life of a few of their affected animals as they know quite well that the affected animals are unfit for work, fetch no price in the market and are, therefore, a burden to them. B. Experiment with Antimosan This drug was supplied in ampoules each containing 2.52 grammes of the dry substance. The contents of each ampoule were dissolved in 40 c. c. of sterilized distilled water and administered intravenously. Two batches of cattle, one consisting of 6 and another 10, were subjected to this experiment. The first batch was injected each at 1.2 grammes per 100 lb. body weight daily for 6 days and the second received three doses of 20 c. c. of the solution each, at a flat rate, at weekly intervals without the consideration of the body weight. Although the precautions taken in injecting this drug were exactly similar to those of tartar emetic, swellings occurred at the seat of injections in a few cases. In all 66 intravenous injection with this drug were carried out, out of which eight were followed by a swelling which, however, was of transient nature and subsided within two to five days. The results of the treatment with this drug were also noted 64 days and 13 months after, details of which are given in Tables IV and V.

These results indicate that Antimosan injected intravenously daily at 1.2 grammes per 100 lb. body weight was efficacious in effecting cure in 66.7 per cent of cases and that the same drug given three times at weekly intervals at a flat rate of 20 c. c. of the solution was effective only in 30 per cent of cases which shows that the former course of treatment is more reliable than the latter but is still not so efficient as that with tartar emetic. II. TREATMENT OF PONDS The quantity of water contained in each of the two ponds was estimated and it was found that the Dodda Honda contained approximately 5,50,000 gallons and the Sanna Honda 3,25,000 gallons of water. So, 4 lb. 3 oz. of copper sulphate were added to the former and 2 lb. and 10 oz. of the same drug to the latter. At first, both the ponds were cleared of all vegetation grow- ing on the banks and of the debris, twigs of trees and jowar stalks etc. lying in them. Branches of trees overhanging the ponds were cut so as to permit sun's rays falling direct on the ponds. Expenses connected with this work were willingly borne by the cultivators themselves. Then, the required quantity of copper sulphate for each pond was obtained, finely powdered, filled in a small gunny bag and with the assistance of a swimmer, contents of the bag were dissolved uniformly in the water of each pond. Inspection of the ponds was carried out 48 hours after the treatment and no living snails were found. A second inspection of the ponds was made 64 days after the treatment and only empty shells of snails were found. The inspection of the water ponds was again carried out 13 months after the treatment. During this interval the village had passed through one rainy season and the ponds were drained off and refilled with storm water which flowed down from the hillocks and from other ponds in the neighbourhood. This inspection which was carried out on 1 January 1941, showed that the ponds were re-infested with the same species of snails which have been mentioned already. This fact indicates that the treatment of ponds with copper sulphate should be carried out every year after the rains.
R. N. NAIK 157 SUMMARY 1. An experiment on the control of nasal granuloma was carried out at Shirbadgi, a village in Dharwar district under field conditions. 2. Affected cases numbering 77 were given a full course of treatment with tartar emetic by injecting intravenously 1 . 5 grains per 100 lb. body weight daily for six days with the results that 63 cases were found completely cured of the disease even at the end of a year after treatment which reveals that the full course of treatment is capable of effecting cure in 81.8 per cent of the cases treated. 3. Affected cases numbering 14 received a part course of the treatment with tartar emetic at the doses mentioned above of which only 8 were cured of the disease. 4. Antimosan was injected intravenously in 6 animals at 1.2 grammes per 100 lb. body weight daily for six days with the results that four out of them got cured of the disease, while the same drug injected intravenously at 20 c. c. dose of the solution at a flat rate at weekly intervals produced a permanent cure in only three out of 10 animals so treated. 5. Toxic symptoms due to the cumulative action of tartar emetic were developed in 13.2 per cent of cases with fatal results in about 4 per cent of them. 6. Cases of toxicity produced by tartar emetic were successfully treated with tannic acid, jaggery and linseed meal. 7. A cow in lactation failed to show a reduction in the milk yield due to the tartar emetic injections. 8. Pregnant animals numbering two were given the treatment with tartar emetic but in none abortion occurred. 9. The cure noticed at the end of a year after the treatment has alone been found to be reliable as a few cases which had shown an apparent recovery two months after the treatment manifested symptoms of the disease in a mild form after a period of about six months. 10. Although 15.6 per cent of animals failed to recover completely from the disease as the result of a full course of treatment with tartar emetic the cases treated decidedly showed a relief from the disease due to the absence of granulomatous growth which disappeared as a result of the action of the drug and the animals were found useful for every kind of work for the time being. 11. All cases which received a full or part course of the treatment showed an improvement in their general body condition. 12. Ponds infested with snails notably Indoplanorbis exustus were treated with copper sulphate at 1 oz. per 7,800 gallons of water with the result that all snails were found dead 48 hours after the treatment. But the observation made after the rainy season showed that they were re-infested with the same due to the fresh infection brought by storm water which flowed through infested ponds lying on a high level. 13. The course of treatment with tartar emetic at 1.5 grains per 100 lb. body weight recommended by Rao and Mudaliar [1936] constitutes the best method of practical value in treating nasal granuloma cases.
158 Experiment on the Control of Nasal Granuloma 14. Although there were three deaths among 91 cases treated with antimony tartrate cultivators showed no dissatisfaction over the treatment. On the contrary they have been found eulogising the véterinary aid rendered to their stock suffering from nasal granuloma which according to their opinion, was an incurable disease and expressing their grateful thanks to the Veterinary Department. 15. The experiment on the control of nasal granuloma has helped the cultivators of Shirbadgi to improve their economic condition to a great extent as cultivators were spared of the expenditure of purchasing new animals for work and were able to sell the surplus stock in a fit condition for enticing prices. 16. Nasal granuloma prevalent in an endemic form in any village can be controlled by treating affected animals with antimony tartrate and by des- troying snails living in ponds with copper sulphate but for effecting a complete eradication of the disease it is necessary to repeat the treatment in obstinate affected animals and also for snails where ponds get infested with fresh snails every year during monsoon.

PANDE, M.Sc, M.R.C.V.S. Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, Lucknow (Received for publication on 16 August 1941) (With Plates XVIP. G. PANDE 161 contortus (30,000) and Oesophagostomum columbianum (24,000). Treatment with Nema Capsule Parke Davis & Co.) and a mixture of copper sulphate and infusion of tobacco was adopted, and this line of treatment brought about a temporary improvement in the general condition of some of the goats only. In March 1936, a report regarding the health of these goats was again received in which it was stated that they were showing symptoms of anaemia, subcutaneous oedema in the region of the throat, emaciation and watery diarrhoea with segments of tapeworms. These symptoms at the time gave no indication of any other condition than the parasitic infestation, but when in May 1936, a fairly large number of bovines and some buffaloes at the same farm were declared as definite cases of Johne's disease, it was suspected that the goats might be suffering from the same disease, and immediately the condi- tion was diagnosed by post-slaughter examination of four goats available for the purpose. Post-mortem findings The goats were killed at a stage when they were showing persistent diarrhoea and debility. On opening the carcases the internal organs, parti- cularly the liver, the kidneys and the spleen of all the goats appeared to be anaemic, as no blood or blood-tinged fluid escaped from their cut surfaces. The abdominal cavity in each case contained from 50 to 100 c.c. of straw- coloured serous fluid. The carcases were devoid of subcutaneous fat and the suprarenal and the mesenteric fat depots in the body were transformed into translucent and yellow jelly-like masses. The coils of the alimentary canal on handling were found to be thickened and corded. On slitting and laying open the entire gut the mucous membranes in two of them were found consid- erably thickened and corrugated in a continuous manner over a great length excepting the jejunum in which a few areas without corrugations were also seen. In the remaining two cases the corrugated and thickened areas, although present, were fewer in number and smaller in size. Some parts of the intestines contained no corrugations but were considerably thickened and oedematous. The corrugations were observed to occur in the form of distinct wrinkles (Plate XVI, fig. 1) arranged annularly across the gut. The blood capillaries lying over the summits of these wrinkles were found to be prominent and the intervening crevices contained slimy debris composed of exfoliated epithelium and mucus. The mesenteric lymphatic glands of all the four cases were found consid- erably enlarged and appeared to be soft and oedematous to touch. Bisection of these glands allowed a thin greenish fluid to escape, and the cut surfaces showed lacunae and small caseous areas in the substance of the glands. Laboratory findings Bacteriological.162 paratuberculosis (Johne's Disease) in Goats and pieces of intestines from all the four cases preserved in 50 per cent glycerine were sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for cultural examination and the following report was received from the Institute. ' Culturally, a pure strain of the organism (Mycobacterium para- tuberculosis) was cultivated upon Twort and Ingram's Myco. phlei agar medium, and this strain appears to be. indistinguishable both morphologically and culturally from stock bovine strains maintained at this Institute. At the end of the third week of incubation, it was possible to detect with the aid of a hand lens magnifying ten diameters, minute growths of the organism on the surface of the medium, but at the end of the fourth week the growths were discernible to the naked eye.'

P. G. PANDE 163 kept is small. On the results of their experiments, however, they came to the conclusion that these animals were so susceptible by nature that the disease when once introduced into a herd might readily spread by contagion. Consid- ering the high susceptibility of these animals to Johne's bacilli as proved by these authors, it may be stated, at least for India, where goats are kept in such a large number that they form an important dairy stock of the country, that the occurrence of Johne's disease in these animals is of considerable importance. Regarding the source of infection, as far as this outbreak is concerned, it may with some degree of certainty be said that the goats contracted the infec- tion from cattle in which the incidence of this disease prior to its detection in goats at the same farm was ascertained to be quite high. In May 1935, when this herd was placed at the Sylhet Farm the chances of these animals catching infection from cattle through a common pasture were considerable and the few deaths which occurred amongst them in November 1935, may, in all probabi- lity, be ascribed to Johne's disease in which an early diagnosis was complicated by the presence of an overwhelming number of helminth parasites. On this assumption the incubation period of the disease in goats may be stated to be about six months. Like Johne's disease in sheep in which, in most instances, spread of infec- tion from cattle was not proved [McFadyean and Sheather, 1916], Holmboe and Slagsvold [1934] in a natural outbreak of the same disease in goats failed to establish its origin from infected cattle or any other possible sources of infection, and their account of the disease suggests that there might, as in case of Johne's disease in sheep [McEwen, 1939], exist a different strain of Mycobac- terium paratuberculosis, responsible for the affection in goats. As regards the actual nature of the caseating lesions in the mesenteric lymph glands it may be pointed out that McFadyean and Sheather [1916] from the materials of their cases proved, by guinea-pig inoculation experiments, that such lesions in goats may occur entirely as a result of infection with Johne's bacilli. The necessity of conducting similar experiments in the present case was obviated by the history of the herd and the farm, and also by the knowledge that tuberculosis in goats is extremely rare in India. Also, it is hardly credible that both tuberculosis and Johne's disease could have been simultaneously present in every goat examined. SUMMARY A natural outbreak of paratuberculosis in goats has been described The history of the farm and the herd point to the probability that these animals acquired infection from infected cattle maintained on the same farm.

PARASITES AND PARASITOSIS OF SHEEP BY T. VINAYAKA MUDALIAR, G.M.V.C. Superintendent AND S. VAITHYANATHA MUDALIAR, G.M.V.C Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Hosur Cattle Farm (Received for publication on 16 June 1941) AN attempt is made in this article to bring together the facts and experi- ences connected with helminth parasites infesting the sheep of the Hosur Cattle Farm and the disease conditions produced by them. Sheep breeding has been going on at this farm for quite a long time now, and the present flock has been built up under a sheep breeding scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. One of the items in the programme of the scheme is to conduct investigation into diseases. A careful post-mortem examination of a large number of affected animals reveals the following parasites as occurring among sheep more or less com- monly. A. Trematodes :166 Parasites and Parasitosis of Sheep 1. Haemonchus contortus Symptoms.T. V. MUDALIAR AND S. V. MUDALIAR 167 set up by the worms causes secretion of increased stomach juices, inducing the animal to consume more food, but all this is probably not digested or only partially so. The chief loss is of blood resulting in anaemia, insufficient nutri- tion of organs and muscles, with consequent wasting. The fluid part of the blood oozes through the ill-nourished vessel-wall and produces oedema. The toxins liberated by-the parasites, particularly when in large numbers, get into the circulation and the various excretory organs are unduly taxed. The heart and lungs share the brunt of the attack and become weakened and diseased. The liver shares the same fate resulting in fatty infiltration and degeneration. In this exhausted state of health, when the whole animal economy is surcharged with toxins and the blood rendered thin and deficient in haemoglobin, the hosts become an easy prey to any slight infection with bacterial diseases. 2. Oesophagostomum columbianum (Nodular worm) This worm inhabits the large intestines, particularly the caecum and colon. When a successful infestation is established the symptoms exhibited by the host are almost the same as those mentioned under Haemonchus contortus. The lesions are, in the early cases, an acute enteritis, being set up by the presence of a large number of larvae of the worm penetrating to the submucosa with consequent irritation and inflammation, resulting in the formation of small little nodules. These nudules are soft, greyish in the beginning later becoming filled with pus. due to bacterial contamination and finally become calcified due to deposition of calcium salts in them. The inflammation set up in the intestines, in course of time with the continued irritation and formation of a large number of nodules, becomes chronic and the mucous membrane is very much thickened along with a thick covering of mucous in the lumen. In these circumstances, digestion and absorption are interfered with, resulting in the same sequelae as those mentioned under Haemonchus contortus. Locked up in the thick mucous, are found a large number of worms. This nodular enteritis (pimply gut) is the cause of so many deaths in sheep, with great loss of vitality, flesh and weight. The absorption of toxins liberated by the worms and the secondary invasion of bacteria from the intestines may result in complications such as peritonitis, pneumonia, pleuritis and pericarditis. 3. Moniezias Infestation with these worms is noticed mostly in lambs from three to five or six months of age. Lambs harbouring these worms show symptoms of rough coat, falling off of wool, a greatly pendulous abdomen, wasting and greenish thin diarrhoea. Examination of faeces by Sheather's floatation method reveals plenty of ova. It is very rare to find infestation with tape- worms alone and in the majority of cases observed, there is co-existent hae- monchosis and oesophagostomiasis. Instances in which nothing but worms were found tightly packed in the intestines, from beginning to end, were many. The emaciation caused to the lambs is enormous, especially when the other worms (Haemonchus contortus
168 Parasites and Parasitosis of Sheep and Oesophagostomum columbianum) are also present. In infestation with tape-worms, not much enteritis is noticed, but a great pallor of the intestinal mucosa is visible, as if the animal has been bled to death. Apart from the loss of nutriment to the host, the amount of calcium depleted from the animal must be enormous considering the quantity required for the tape-worms to grow in such large numbers. The harm done to the host in the case of infestation with the tape-worms is primarily the loss of blood calcium. With a rapid fall in the blood calcium content, the animal's resistance goes down leading to other complications, if not in death. SUMMARY The commoner helminth parasites met with in the sheep on the Hosur Cattle Farm, viz. Haemonchus contortus, Oesophagostomum columbianum and the Moniezias, the clinical symptoms and lesions produced by them and the histopathology have been dealt with in this article.

170 On two New Mallophaga from the Kite with the oblong abdomen. The body colouration is more or less chestnut brown with somewhat darker head and thorax. The head is broader than its length. In front the head is of the shape of a trapezium with rounded corners. There are a number of setæ along the anterior margin of the head, five to seven on each side of the median line. Closely behind this row of setæ on the clypeus is a set of four long bristles. Following this on the dorsal surface there is another set of very long bristles which surpass all the others described above in length being nearly double those of the second row. The two innermost bristles of this row are placed in between the two bristles of each side of the second row. The anterior rounded corners of the trapezoidal area of the head are devoid of bristles. On the lateral margin, a swelling with five or six long bristles and a similar number of smaller setæ is present. Behind the swelling there is a long bristle on either side. Antenna is concealed and composed of four segments, of which the distal segment is clavate. Eyes are hemispherical and projecting. Temples are angular and projected backwardly having nine setæ marginally on each side and two bristles internally on top of the head. The occiput is deeply convex with a dark band marginally. The mandibles are sharply pointed and the maxillæ are imperfectly developed. The maxillary palpi are prominent and four-segmented. The prothorax is free and somewhat roundish with a lateral depression on either side. Posteriorly the prothorax has a much lighter area. Anteriorly the rounded margin has an assemblage of some strong setæ numbering about 16 or 17 on either side. Laterally the prothorax has about six long bristles on either side, and dorsally on the clearer posterior portion there are two strong bristles. There is a median furrow running all along the prothorax and this continues right within the metathorax involving two-thirds or more of the latter. There is no trace of the furrow in the abdomen. The meta- thorax is bilobed in front and concave posteriorly. It is narrower than the head and furnished with long bristles laterally. The legs, especially the third pair, are strongly developed and of dark brown colour. The femora are somewhat longer than the tibiæ. Each femur has two longitudinal rows of setæ of which the one situated towards the ante- rior margin is composed of much longer setæ than those on the other row. The tibiæ are arched and form a sort of a sharp heel at their junction with the tarsus. The first tarsal segment is small and roundish ; the second tarsal segment is long and curved and somewhat flattened distally with two strong curved claws at the tip. The abdomen of the female is oblong and composed of nine visible seg- ments and bordered by unequal hair-like bristles. There is a row of long bristles sub-marginally on the posterior face of each segment excepting the first. The first abdominal segment is small, so is the eighth. The fourth and fifth abdominal segments have the maximum width. The ninth segment is rounded at apex with several long and fine bristles arising from it. The species described here differs from L. titan (Piaget) a closely allied spe- cies recorded from a kite, Milvus ætolius (ater) [Piaget, 1880] in its head being broader than its length, in the absence of bristles on the corners of the trapezoi- dal area of the head, in possessing more than four bristles in the lateral

Only two female specimens of the species were obtained for description through the courtesy of Mr K. N. Das, M.Sc., of the Zoological Survey of India, who collected the insects from a kite, Milvus migrans govinda Sykes, in Calcutta. The type specimen is deposited in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Philopterus milvi var. tropica n. var. (Fig. 2) Only one male specimen was available for the present description. The specimen is dark-brown to chestnut in colour and measures about 1.9 mm. in length. The head is sub-triangular with the posterior end broadest. The head bulges out in front into a fleshy transparent outgrowth which also cov ers a portion of the lateral face towards the tip ; anteriorly this outgrowth has a median depression. From the anterior corners of this region two curved lon- gish bristles having their seat of origin on the ventral surface, arise on either side. There is another bristle just below the junction of the transparent out- growth with the dark chitinous margin. The frontal plate is highly chitinous and dark. The trabeculæ, one on each side, are prominent and of light yellow colour. A pair of long bristles are present latero-ventrally in front of the trabe- culæ on either side. The eyes appear as shining protuberances. Behind the eye there are four long bristles. The occiput is slightly rounded in the middle, the corners are almost straight. It bears a pair of small setæ, one on each
172 On two New Mallophaga from the Kite side, almost half-way between the outer boundary of the occiput and its junc- tion with the thorax. The antennæ are brownish and five-segmented, of which the second segment is the longest being almost equal in length to the next two segments in front. The thorax is broader than its length. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Philopterus milvi var. tropica n. var. (x 45). The prothorax is small and widened posteriorly and shows a median suture. In the hinder corner there is a long bristle on either side. The metathorax is much broader and also exhibits a median suture. The dark chitinous plates on each side are irregularly dentate posteriorly. In the metathorax there are three long bristles on each side, one laterally situated and the other two closely apposed and placed on the hinder corner of the thorax. The legs are short and stout and of dark brown colour, and terminate in fine claws. There are nine visible abdominal segments, the last being rounded and small. The first eight segments bear on each side, a dark chitinous plate which is narrowed inwardly. The mid-region of the abdomen not covered by the
PURNENDU SEN 173 chitinous plates is whitish. There is a number of long bristles arising from near the posterior margin of each segment, and the bristles are also present in the lateral margins.

The new variety described here is closely related to Philopterus milvi (Mjöberg) but the two short setæ present in front of the eye of the forma typica are absent in the present variety, and there are only four long bristles on the margin of the head behind the eye against five in the forma typica [Mjöberg, 1910]. In the present variety, there are three long bristles on the metathorax on either side, there being only one in the P. milvi (forma typica). The proportional measurements of certain parts of the body also somewhat differ. The thorax is slightly longer and the abdomen shorter than in the forma typica ; the tibia is longer than femur in the present variety. The specimen was collected from the common pariah kite, Milvus migrans govinda Sykes, in Calcutta along with the Læmobothrion described above by Mr K. N. Das, M.Sc., who kindly handed over the specimen to me for study. The varietal form is deposited in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. REFERENCES Mjöberg, E. (1910). Ark.f. Zool. 6, 109-11 Piaget, E.

ABSTRACT Genetics and livestock production. F. W. DRY (1938). Department of Science & Industrial Research, New Zealand, Bulletin No. 64. Introduction.ABSTRACT 175 The essential fact to be stressed is this : Genetics puts livestock breeding in truer perspective. Do not imagine that light has shone down from Heaven, or radiated from an aloof human brain. Like all scientific advance, an understanding of the principles of genetics has been won by detailed work. This has been carried out not on pigs and cows176 ABSTRACT In cattle, in other parts of the world, a dozen fatal factors, sublethal or lethal, are known.* In Scandinavian Friesians Wriedt and Mohr found two recessive factors, for Hairless (extreme reduction of the hairy coat) and Amputated (gross deficiency of feet and muzzle), to be widespread. The affected calves die about the time of birth. The spread of these factors in the breed could be traced to the wide use of bulls descended, in each of the two cases, from a single very famous sire, highly prized, who was demonstrated from breeding records to have carried the calamitous gene, without in his own person showing any sign of its presence in his hereditary make-up. Several examples have thus been given of how a breed can become riddled with a fatal recessive factor. Wriedt and Mohr show that if the pedigree of any Friesian in Sweden be traced there is ' an overwhelming probability ' of meeting either a certain very famous sire who carried the factor for Hairless or another very famous sire who carried the factor for Amputated, and often both these bulls are encountered in the pedigree. There- fore beware recessive lethals ! It is in the breed interest, and in the national interest, that monstrosities should not be silently buried. Bacteria and non-genetic accidents of development are not for one moment forgotten, but a lookout should be kept for lethal factors ; and especially if more than one child of the same sire possess the same defect suspicion is aroused. Lethals are nasty things not only because they destroy animals valuable in themselves, but in shaking confidence in a breed or herd and in limiting the number of individuals from which breeding animals can be chosen, therefore checking progress by increasing the difficulty of maintaining the status of a herd. In slow-breed- ing animals the proportion of all females born which must be kept in the breeding-flock merely to maintain numbers is quite high, probably 1 in 2 for sheep in this country, and 2 in 5 for cows. Wriedt and Mohr very justly take the lethal situation in their Friesian cattle very seriously. They suggest that a bull should not be allowed to become a bull-fatherABSTRACT 177 Mention of that very stimulating work by Landauer will itself show that in contem- plating the genetics of morbidity we are doing our best to look on the bright side. With lethal factors may conveniently be associated susceptibility to disease. Not too cheerful a topic, you may indeed say, but if we speak of resistance to disease, that sounds more optimistic. In breeding for resistance to rust and smut in cereals the plant geneticists began gaining fame a long time ago. Such resistance may have a monofactorial basis, or may depend upon a larger number of factors. As is well known, plant breeders have been able to combine disease resistance of one variety with the more profitable produc- tive traits of another variety. In animals the arithmatical restrictions under which the breeder labours are alone enough to make breeding for disease resistance difficult, but increasing attention is likely to be paid to the genetic aspect of proneness to disease. The strongest grounds for think- ing this are afforded by long sustained work on laboratory rodents, guinea-pigs, and mice. Sewall Wright, by inbreeding guinea-pigs, brother to sister, for many generations ob- tained lines which showed differences in susceptibility to tuberculosis. In mice, Little and Dr Maud Slye have shown that genetic factors are highly potent in disposing to can- cer or defending against it. To take extremes, in one strain of mice every animal would be safe from cancer, in another strain cancer is stated to be the sole cause of death. The site in the body of attack by cancer has also been shown to be determined by inherit- ance. In a recent survey of animal disease Gowen finds examples of inborn resistance to the whole range of harmful agents, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worm parasites, and chemical poisons. ' So far as I am aware,' he says, ' no investigator who has adequately sought inherited host differences in disease response has failed to find them.' In fowls he cites bacillary white diarrh178 ABSTRACT The accepted explanation of linkage is that linked factors reside on the same chro- mosome. That is why they do not assort independently. When linked factors do part company it is because, as we now know from very pretty and intricate evidence, there has been an exchange of material between the two members of a pair of chromosomes. In animals and plants in which many genes have been recognized it is found that they fall into groups of factors, the members of each group, we are well justified in believing, being carried on the same chromosome. Strong but simple evidence for this conclusion is that in a few animals and plants that have been very intensively studied and possess a com- paratively small number of pairs of chromosomesERRATA THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Volume XII, Part I, 1942 Page 61, line 7, for Plate I read Plate II Page 72, line 10, for lives stock read livestock Page 73, 3rd line from bottom, for Stapesdon read Stapledon
ORIGINAL ARTICLES THE VITAMIN-A POTENCY OF COW'S MILK AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CAROTENE INGESTION BY K. C. SEN, D.Sc. Officer-in-charge AND B. C. RAI SARKAR, M.Sc. Research Assistant Animal Nutrition Section Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 21 July 1941) IN a recent review Woodman [1939] has drawn attention to the investiga- tion carried out by Atkeson et al. [1937], in which they have shown that, when cows are kept on abundant green pasture with a carotene intake of about one to six million International Units daily, only 0 . 24 per cent of the total ingested carotene appears in the butterfat in the form of carotene and vitamin- A and that thus there is a great wastage of the ingested substance. Four years previously, Baumann and Steenbock [1933] had found that in the case of a mixed herd, the carotene content of the summer butter did not consti- tute more than 15 per cent of the total vitamin-A potency. These authors considered that, although a large amount of carotene could be given to animals by including excessive amounts of carotene as green fodders in the ration, there was some factor in the body which controlled the conversion of carotene into vitamin-A. In later experiments, Baumann et al. [1934] observed definite breed differences, when carotene and vitamin-A contents of butterfat from cows of various breeds on high and low carotene diet were examined. On a low carotene ration, about 3.3 per cent of the ingested vitamin-A was secreted in the milk, while on a high carotene ration only 1.3 per cent was secreted. The effect of seasonal variation (which includes different levels of carotene intake in winter and summer) on the vitamin-A potency of cow's butter has been summarized by Davies [1939] who has referred to the works of Crawford et al. [1932], Fraps and Treichler [1932], Booth et al. [1933], Watson et al. [1933] and Gillam et al. [1933]. Although in the earlier work of Baumann and Steenbock [1933], the caro- tene in butter constituted, on an average, 15 per cent of the total vitamin-A potency, later work by Baumann et al. [1934] revealed that, on typical pastur- age conditions, carotene constituted about 32 per cent of the total potency. Atkeson et al. (1937) found, with two Ayrshire cows and one Holstein, which were kept on an excessive amount of green pasture, an average value of 35 per cent as the potency of carotene in butter. Neither this proportion 179 B
180 Vitamin-A Potency of Cow's Milk nor the total vitamin-A potency of butter could be further increased. The total vitamin-A potency determined spectroscopically by Baumannn and Steenbock and by Atkeson et al., was 14,000 and 13,000 International Units per pound of butter respectively. Fraps and his co-workers [1937] obtained, by biological assay, a total potency of about 17,000 Sherman-Munsel units and Wilbur, Hilton and Hauge [1940] found a value of about 14,900 Sherman- Munsel units per pound of butter respectively, a Sherman-Munsel unit being roughly equivalent to 1.4 International Units. All these results appear to show that the amount of vitamin-A production in butter cannot exceed a certain limit. As no comparable work of this type has been carried out on the milch breeds of India, it was thought desirable to carry out some inves- tigations along this line. Attempts have been made to determine the carotene and vitamin-A production in the milk of the well known Hariana breed of dairy cattle under controlled conditions with two different levels of carotene intake. Incidentally, the effect of carotene ingestion on the carotene and vitamin-A contents of the blood plasma of cows was also studied. EXPERIMENTAL Seven Hariana cows were obtained from the local dairy and were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of four cows, Nos. 46, 123, 145 and 180. These animals were stall-fed and received the regular herd ration of concentrate (wheat bran 40 parts, gram husk 20 parts, ground-nut cake 20 parts, rape cake 10 parts and gram chuni 10 parts), 25 lb. of Napier grass per head and hay for a period of two months. The Napier grass was poor in carotene, being at a late stage of growth, and this diet represented, therefore, a low carotene ration. At the end of this period, milk samples were collected for carotene and vitamin-A estimations, after which the daily quota of Napier grass was replaced by 10 lb. of berseem. After an interval of ten days, fresh samples of milk were collected for analysis. The average milk yields of the cows were 4.8 lb., 9.9 lb., 12.6 lb. and 6.6 lb., the stage of lactation being seven, two, two and six months respectively. The second group of animals consisted of three cows, Nos. 42, 83 and 84. They were kept in the dairy, allowed free movement and received a ration containing the above daily mixture with hay. The main source of carotene for these animals was 28 lb. of berseem daily in addition to a rather negligible amount available by grazing. After 15 days on this diet, milk samples were obtained for analysis and then the berseem ration was replaced by 18 lb. of oat hay daily for another 19 days. This constituted the carotene-poor ration and, at the end of this period of feeding, milk samples were again analysed. The average milk yield was 11.75 lb., 15 lb. and 18 lb. respectively. Animal No. 42 was in the third month and the other two in their second month of lactation. As the dairy animals are milked twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, these samples were examined separately. This gave interesting information in regard to the carotene and vitamin-A secretion in the morning and evening milk respectively. A mixed sample representing the total daily milk yield was also separately analysed. The figures obtained in this analysis
K. C SEN AND B. C. RAI SARKAR 181 have been utilized for the comparative study of vitamin-A secretion in the daily butterfat from the various animals under different conditions. The fat was determined by the Gerber's method and the carotene and vitamin-A were extracted by the method of Olson, Hegsted and Peterson [1939]. Carotene was then determined colorimetrically and vitamin-A spectroscopi- cally. The carotene content of the feeding stuff was determined by the modified method of Seshan and Sen [1941]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In tabulating the results of this investigation, both carotene and vitamin- A are expressed in terms of International Units for the sake of convenience. Although there still exists some confusion regarding the conversion factors which should be used to express the amount of plant carotene and milk caro- tene, the whole of which is not ß -carotene, the factors used in this paper are similar to those used by Atkeson et al., namely one microgram of vitamin A=1.56 I.U. and one microgram of carotene = 1.66 I.U. In Table I, the results of carotene and vitamin-A estimations of the morning and evening milk of the stall-fed animals under two levels of carotene intake, as described previously, are shown. It will be observed that under both levels of carotene feeding, when the data are expressed per pound of milk, the evening milk consistently shows a higher carotene, vitamin-A and total vitamin-A potency than the morning milk of all the animals. Thus, taking the average values of the total vitamin-A potency for all the animals, the evening milk is richer by 28 . 8 per cent in the case of carotene-low ration and by 50. 9 per cent on a carotene-high ration. Attempts to explain this phenomenon by taking into account the usual increase in the fat content of the evening milk have not been very satisfactory. In some animals there is a correlation between the amount of fat secretion and the vitamin-A content. whereas in others, the evening butterfat appears to contain a slightly higher percentage of vitamin-A. Similar results have been obtained in the case of the second group of animals kept under dairy conditions (Table II). Here also it will be noticed that the average vitamin-A potency of evening milk is higher than that of the morning milk by 33.6 per cent in the case of high carotene feed and by 27.3 per cent in the case of carotene low feed. In Table III, the results are given of the effect of different levels of carotene ingestion on the total vitamin-A potency of butterfat. In planning the experiments it was decided to raise the level of carotene ingestion with the stall-fed group of animals, whereas, in the case of the animals kept in the dairy and as such accustomed to a fairly high carotene ingestion, the level of carotene intake was considerably lowered during the second half of the experiment. It will be observed from this table that with two different levels of carotene intake, namely 20,797 I. U. and 361,980 I.U. in the case of the stall-fed animals, the carotene content increased by 49.8 per cent and vitamin-A by 51.7 per cent and the total potency by 51.4 per cent. In the case of the second group of animals, a reduction in the carotene intake from 869128 I.U. to 88175 I.U. reduced the carotene content of the butter- fat by 67.7 per cent, the vitamin-A content by 18.7 per cent and the total B 2

It will thus be observed that, although raising the carotene intake from a very low level to a moderately high level gives practically proportionate increase in both carotene and vitamin-A, a sudden lowering of the carotene ingestion from a very high level to a low level affects the carotene content more markedly than the vitamin-A content. In other words, a lower ingestion of carotene reduces the carotene secretion in milk immediately but the effect on vitamin-A secretion is slower. In this connection some estimations of the carotene and vitamin-A content of the blood plasma of the second group of animals under these two different levels of carotene feeding were carried out according to the method of Gillam and ElRidi [1935] and the results are given in Table IV. It will be observed that the blood plasma of the animals on a high carotene diet contained on an average 1.67 mg. of carotene and 0.374 mg. of vitamin-A per 100 c.c. plasma. But, when these animals were on a low carotene diet, the plasma carotene level fell to 0.634 mg. per 100 c.c., showing a decrease of 61.3 per cent, while the plasma vitamin-A was so low that these values could not be determined. The plasma vitamin-A (total) potency could thus be correlat- ed with the potency of the milk. The next interesting question, to which attention may now be drawn, is the percentage recovery of the ingested carotene in butterfat. For this purpose, data have been calculated on the basis of the total butterfat pro- duction of each animal (see Tables V and VI). It may be observed from Table V that in the case of stall-fed animals, the percentage of carotene recovered as carotene and vitamin-A is 10.10 in the case of carotene-low rations but only 0 . 85 in that of carotene-high rations. In the case of the second group of animals (Table VI) the percentage recovery is 4.13 in the case of carotene- low ration and 1.16 in the case of carotene-high ration. These figures thus show an enormous wastage of the ingested carotene in the animal body and the results are more or less similar to those obtained by Atkeson et al.
188 Vitamin-A Potency of Cow's Milk It was mentioned previously that carotene in butter contributed but a small part of the total vitamin-A potency but Atkeson et al. could raise the potency due to carotene to about 35 per cent of the total vitamin-A potency by heavy green fodder feeding (141.3 lb. green rye per head per day). This they considered to be typical of pasturage conditions. Baumann and Steen- bock fed about 50 lb. of green fodder daily, considering this to be typical summer feeding, and obtained a carotene potency of about 32 per cent of the total. Although it is difficult to estimate the average pasture consumption of Indian cows during the best part of the pasture season, it is likely that the daily consumption of green fodder may be more than 50 lb. which would be roughly equivalent to 1.5 to 2 million International Units of carotene. As a little less than one million units were fed to one group of animals, it was thought of interest to find out the ratio of carotene to vitamin-A in the butter- fat of the two groups of animals. The data are given in Table VII. It will be noticed that, although in some cases the individual variations are wide, the activity due to carotene is 14 per cent of the total vitamin-A potency in the butterfat of the stall-fed animals, while, in the case of the second group of animals on a high carotene ration, the percentage activity due to carotene is 27 of the total vitamin-A potency. It is probable that, with a still higher carotene ingestion in the form of green feed, a value similar to that obtained by Atkeson and others might be obtained. This raises the question as to whether the total vitamin-A potency of butter could be still further increased. It will be noticed from the figures given in Table VI, that the highest vitamin-A potency of butterfat which has been obtained in our experi- ment is with the group II animals, the average value found being 9,745.90 I.U. per lb. of butterfat. A separate experiment with other animals in the Institute dairy herd at Izatnagar has given a value of 13,900 I.U. (January butter) on the pooled milk of 18 animals getting, in addition to 28 lb. of berseem, a certain amount of grazing on dub grass, which is particularly rich in carotene. The activity due to carotene in this sample is 35 per cent of the total vitamin-A potency. It appears, therefore, that it is possible by suitable feeding to increase the vitamin-A potency of the butter of the dairy animals in this country to a level comparable to that of the dairy animals in other countries. SUMMARY 1. An experimental investigation has been carried out to study the effect of different levels of carotene ingestion on the carotene and vitamin-A potency of milk and butterfat. 2. It has been found that, when the potency is expressed per pound of milk, the evening milk shows a higher concentration of both carotene and vitamin-A. 3. When a carotene-low ration is replaced by a carotene-high ration both the carotene and vitamin-A content of butterfat show a considerable increase. Similarly, when animals on a carotene-high ration are placed on a carotene-low ration, there is a fall in the total vitamin-A potency of the butterfat, the carotene part of it showing an immediate change.
K. C. SEN AND B. C. RAI SARKAR 189 4. Variations in the carotene intake have a marked effect on the carotene and vitamin-A content of the blood plasma of animals. 5. The average vitamin-A potency of butterfat on a carotene intake of 869,128 I. U. per day is about 9,745.9 I. U. per lb. of butterfat (January) and it appears that this value can be still further raised by additional green fodder feeding. The percentage recovery of carotene in butterfat with this amount of carotene ingestion is only 1.16 showing a large wastage of this material. 6. Carotene appears to contribute about 27 per cent of the total potency of butterfat under this type of feeding, but, with increased green fodder ingestion, it is possible to raise this figure up to about 35 per cent, but not beyond this figure.

PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS FOR CHICKENS BY A. J. MACDONALD, B.Sc., B.Sc. (AFRI.), N.D.A. Officer-in-charge, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 5 September 1941) PREVIOUS experiments carried out by the author [1941] demonstrated that cereal diets, even when supplemented with adequate amounts of green food and calcium, gave very inadequate results when fed as the sole diet to young chickens. From day old to six weeks, very satisfactory growth results and low mortality were obtained by feeding chicks with a mixed cereal ration plus liberal amounts of green food and calcium supplemented with separated milk only to drink. From 6-24 weeks, the basal ration plus separat- ed milk and water in separate containers gave satisfactory growth, low morta- lity and early sexual maturity. In efforts to reduce the cost of chick rations, supplement of soya-bean meal plus salt, though not so satisfactory as the supplement of separated milk, gave results which indicated that suitable vegetable proteins plus salt might be used with considerable success when separated milk was unobtainable or too expensive. In view of the limited amounts of soya-bean meal available in many parts of India, it was decided to conduct a further trial with a cheap vege- table protein which could be obtained fairly easily in all parts of the country. Ground earthnut cake, hereafter referred to as earthnut meal, was used in this study and the results have been compared with those obtained by using a separated milk supplement.

A. J. MACDONALD 191 Feeding Both the groups were fed on mash and grain rations throughout the whole experiment. The mash was fed ad libitum in suitable containers and the grain was fed in the morning and evening according to appetite. Broken limestone of suitable size was fed ad libitum throughout and liberal amounts of succulent green food (berseem) were fed daily. The basal mash fed consisted of wheat bran 50 parts, yellow maize meal 30 parts and finely ground oats 20 parts. During the first eight weeks of the experiment, the grain ration consisted of equal parts of broken yellow maize, jowar and cheena. From eight weeks onward, the grain mixture consisted of equal parts of broken yellow maize, wheat and paddy. Group 1 was fed the basal rations plus separated milk only to drink during the first nine weeks. From nine weeks onward, separated milk and water in separate containers were fed instead of the separated milk only. Group 2 was given water to drink throughout but, up to 16 weeks, the basal mash was supplemented with 20 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent common salt. From 16-24 weeks, a supplement of 10 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent common salt was used in place of the previous supplement of 20 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent salt. Table II gives the average composition of the mashes and grain fed to the birds. Rate of growth The chickens were weighed individually on each occasion and the average weekly or biweekly weights in ounces of the cockerels and pullets of each breed in each group are given in Table III. For convenience, Group 1, fed on separated milk only to drink for the first nine weeks and separated milk and water from that time onward, is hereafter known as the ' milk fed group ' and Group 2 fed on the earthnut mash as the ' earthnut group '. The cocker- els were removed from the experiment at 10 weeks. The weights of the cockerels and pullets of the three breeds were greater in Group 1 at each weighing from two to eight weeks of age. The differences in weight between the corresponding birds in the two groups became consistently greater at each weighing in the milk-fed group. At 10 weeks of age, the birds in the milk group were significantly heavier than the corresponding birds in the earthnut group. At 10 weeks, the average weights of the White Leghorn, Rhode Island Red and desi males in Group 1 were 26 . 4, 28.6 and 20.0 oz. respectively, whilst the corresponding figures in Group 2 were 19.4, 21.7 and 16.3 oz. respectively. The average weights of the females in Group 1 at 10 weeks were White Leghorn 22.7, Rhode Island Red 26.2 and desi 18.5 oz. whilst in Group 2 the corresponding figures were 16.4, 18. 5 and 14.2 oz. respectively. From 10 to 16 weeks, the Rhode Island Red and desi pullets in Group 1 grew somewhat faster than the corresponding birds in Group 2 but the White Leghorn pullets in Group 2 grew slightly faster than the pullets in Group 1. At 16 weeks, the average weights of the White Leg- horn, Rhode Island Red and desi pullets in Group 1 were 38.5, 46.7 and 36.3 oz. respectively. The corresponding figures in Group 2 were 33.9, 38. 3

In Group 1 none of the Leghorns, 22 per cent of the Rhodes and 75 per cent of the desis had started to lay by 24 weeks, whereas none of the Leghorns or Rhodes and only 43 per cent of the desis had produced eggs in Group 2. At 24 weeks the average egg production per bird in Group 1 was nil for the Leghorns, 1.0 for the Rhodes and 7 . 6 for the desis. The corresponding figures in Group 2 were nil for the Leghorns and Rhodes and 0. 9 for the desis.

A. J. MACDONALD 197 43 and 25 per cent respectively. At 26 weeks the average egg production per bird in Group 1 was 2.8 for the Leghorns and 5.0 for the Rhodes. The corresponding figures in Group 2 were 0.9 for the Leghorns and 0.8 for the Rhodes. There were no significant differences in the weights of the eggs produced by the birds in the two groups. DISCUSSION The rate of growth and general health of the birds on the basal diet sup- plemented with separated milk only to drink from 1 to 10 weeks and separated milk and water to drink from 10 to 24 weeks were very satisfactory through- out all the stages of the experiment. As the level of the protein in the food consumed was very much lower than the accepted standard of 18-20 per cent, this experiment in conjunction with previous experiments [Macdonald, 1941] demonstrates that chickens can be reared very successfully on rations con- taining 12-13 per cent protein when separated milk is fed as the sole protein- rich supplement. As the protein percentages in the food consumed by the birds up to 16 weeks on the earthnut cake mash were higher for each period than those consumed by the birds on the separated milk ration, it is obvious that the lower rate of growth of the birds on the earthnut meal mash could not have been due primarily to a low protein level. The better growth results from 1 to 16 weeks with the birds on the separated milk diet cannot be attri- buted to any single factor in the milk and are probably due to the high biolo- gical value of the milk proteins, its richness in vitamins, especially the growth- promoting factor, and its well-balanced mineral content. The better growth results from 16 to 24 weeks obtained with the birds on the basal ration supplemented with 10 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent common salt in the mash are quite a natural phenomenon, for birds that are retarded in growth by inferior diets during the early stages of growth tend to grow faster during the later stages of growth than birds which had been previously fed on more adequate rations. At 24 weeks, there were no signi- ficant differences between the respective weights of either the quick-matur- ing Leghorns or desi pullets in the two groups under test, but in the case of the slower maturing Rhode Island Reds, the birds in the ' milk fed group' were significantly heavier than those in the ' earthnut group '. Over the whole experiment the birds fed on the milk diet made slightly better utilization of their food, for the average food consumption per bird was a shade lower, whilst the average final weights were higher for all the three breeds. The somewhat lower efficiency of food utilization on the part of the ' milk-fed group ' during the latter part of the experiment is quite normal, for birds that are well fed during early life, make poor utilization of their food during the later stages of growth as compared with birds which have been less well fed during the early stages of growth. CONCLUSIONS (1) During the early stages of growth (1-10 weeks), a ration of cereals supplemented by liberal amounts of green food and calcium along with separt- ed milk only to drink gave normal growth results, low mortality and efficient food utilization. C 2
198 Protein Supplements for Chickens (2) From 10 to 24 weeks, the feeding of milk and water in separate contain- ers along with a cereal ration plus liberal amounts of green food and calcium gave satisfactory growth results, efficient food utilization and a normal rate of sexual maturity. (3) From 1 to 16 weeks, a basal ration supplemented with 20 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent salt in the mash did not give as good growth results as a basal ration supplemented with separated milk only to drink from 1 to 10 weeks and separated milk and water to drink from 10 to 16 weeks. (4) From 16 to 24 weeks, the basal ration plus 10 per cent earthnut meal and 1 per cent salt in the mash gave somewhat better growth results than that given by the separated milk and water ration. (5) Over the whole experimental period, the basal ration supplemented with separated milk only to drink from 1 to 10 weeks and separated milk and water from 10 to 24 weeks gave better growth results, more efficient food utili- zation and earlier sexual maturity than the basal ration supplemented with earthnut meal and salt. (6) Satisfactory results were obtained with the basal ration plus separated milk only to drink from 1 to 10 weeks and separated milk and water to drink from 10 to 24 weeks, even though the percentage of protein in the ration was considerably lower at all stages than the accepted standards. (7) The results obtained with the earthnut cake ration, though not so good as those obtained with the separated milk ration were fairly satisfactory in regard to the rate of growth, general health, rapidity of sexual maturity and efficiency of food utilization. In the absence of separated milk or other suitable milk products, earthnut meal plus salt can be used with very consi- derable success in chick rations. REFERENCE Macdonald, A. J. (1941).

OBSERVATIONS ON NORMAL WORM BURDEN OF GOATS FROM CERTAIN DISTRICTS IN THE UNITED PROVINCES BY P. G. PANDE, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S. Veterinary Investigation Officer, United Provinces, Lucknow (Received for publication on 1 September 1941) DURING recent years, it may be said that considerable advance has been made on the taxonomic study of different species of helminth parasites [Bhalerao, 1940 and Thapar, 1939] found in goats in the United Provinces. Though important, such studies have given little indication of the frequency and intensity of infestation by any one species and as such, its true significance as a cause of disease has remained undetermined. During the ast few years field workers in this country have come across conditions in sheep and goats in which clinical and post-mortem findings had suggested diagnoses of helminthiasis on the basis of preponderance in number of one or more than one species of worms found in certain organs of the body. Such instances in goats are acute paramphistomiasis [Sahai, 1938 ; Bawa, 1939 ; and Pande, 1939] caused by immature paramphistomes, parasitic gastro-enteritis [Bawa, 1938] caused by Haemonchus contortus and a few other Strongyloid worms, and parasitic pneumonia [Chadha, 1937 and Balwant Singh, 1938] caused by Varestrongylus pneumonicus. These reports, there- fore, clearly indicate that the pathogenicity of helminth parasites would, to a great extent, depend upon their numerical strength, whether occurring singly or mixed with other species in their normal habitats in the body of the host. The necessary pre-requisite, therefore, in the diagnosis of helminthic conditions is reliable knowledge of the normal worm burden of animals, and as far as goats are concerned, an attempt is made in this paper to supplement the meagre data on the frequency and intensity with which normal goats are infested with different species of helminth parasites in certain localities in these provinces. MATERIALS AND METHODS This survey was started in September 1940, at the Provincial Central Laboratory, Lucknow, goats in apparently good health and required fo the production of Goat Tissue Virus against rinderpest being utilized for the pur- pose. These animals were purchased either from a local market or from out- lying villages at a distance of a few miles from Lucknow. During 1941, from May to July the work was conducted at the slaughter houses in Nainital, Ranikhet and Mussoorie, where animals in average health as judged by general standards were selected for the collection of parasites. In August 1941, 199
200 Normal Worm Burden of Goats the work was resumed at the headquarter's laboratory at Lucknow, and during the period from September 1940 to August 15,1941, 120 goats at the rate of 10 per month were examined. The materials examined were the contents of the first three stomachs, abomasum, duodenum, jejunum and ileum and the large intestines including caecum, comprising the alimentary canal; and the other organs examined were liver including gall-bladder, lungs, pancreas, heart, kidneys and brain. Mesenteric blood vessels and the peritoneum were examined for the presence of schistosomes and hydatid cysts, respectively. Paramphistomes from the first three stomachs were picked up individually, whether lying free in the ingesta or attached to the mucous linings. For differential counts of nematode worms they were collected individually, if present in small numbers, but if found in comparatively larger numbers, the technique of Taylor [1934] with certain modifications was found most service- able. 1. CESTODES Cysticercus tenuicollis, the larva form of Taenia hydatigena (Pallas 1766) of carnivores, was present in 30 animals, the maximum number being five occurr- ing in the mesentery of one animal only. Coenurus cerebralis, the larval form of Multiceps multiceps (Leske 1780) of carnivores, was found in the brain of one goat only. Moniezia expansa (Rudolphi 1810) occurred in three goats, of which two had one each and the third contained two specimens. Stilesia hepatica was found in the liver of one goat only, occurring singly. Stilesia globipunctata (Rivolta 1874) occurred in 40 goats in the duodenum, a few inches beyond the pyloric orific, the maximum number being 50, occupying an area of about six inches of duodenal mucosa. Stilesia vittata (Railliet 1896) occurred in 10 goats, the maximum being 20 encountered in a single goat. The two species of Stilesia were found deeply embedded by their scolices in the mucosa of the duodenum which as a consequence had attained a considerable thickness, this being more marked around the' pits ' revealed after detachment of the worms. The other cestodes encountered in the small and the large intestines were the three species of Avitellina. A. centripunctata (Rivolta 1874) occurred in 10, A. lahorea (Woodland 1927) in six and A. sudanea (Woodland 1927) in four goats, and in case of A. lahorea only in which scolices were available the maximum of 5 were collected from each of two goats. 2. TREMATODES Mature paramphistomes encountered in rumen, reticulum and omasum were collected from 10 goats, the maximum in a goat being about 450 worms in the rumen. Of these, Paramphistomum cervi (Schrank 1790) was present in all, the maximum number in which it occurred being about 300 in six of them. Cotylophoron cotylophorum (Fischoeder 1901) being next in order of frequency, occurred in 6, the maximum degree of infestation being about 240 observed in five goats. Gastrothylax crumenifer (Creplin 1847) was recorded from two goats to the extent of about 50 in each. One of these goats showed mixed infestation with Cotylophoron cotylophorum. Immature forms of these paramphistomes occurred in two goats examined at the Provincial Central Laboratory, Lucknow, in the month of January 1941.
P. G. PANDE 201 These were found attached to the mucosa of the pyloric region of the aboma- sum and the duodenum to the extent of about six inches from the pyloric orific. These numbered about 500 in one and about 350 in another, and on identifica- tion appeared to be the larval forms of P. cervi and C. cotylophorum. As a result of infestation by these forms the duodenal wall was thickened and oede- matous, the mucous coat was covered with necrotic material, and when washed, several minute necrotic ulcers were detectable on the mucous membrane. The liver fluke, Fasciola gigantica (Cobbold 1855) was found in the livers of five goats in a mild degree of infestation, the maximum number recovered being six in one goat. Calcareous nodules due to Schistosoma indicum (Montgomery 1906) infection were observed on the livers of four goats, the number of nodules varying from 3 to 10. One goat showed evidence of recent infestation in which hæmorrhagic areas were seen in the liver parenchyma. The parasites identified as Schisto- soma indicum (Montgomery 1906) were recovered from the mesenteric veins of two of these goats, the number being 5 from one and 8 from the other. The mucous membranes of the caecum and a part of the colon of both goats showed thickening and ulcerations, and scrapings from these on microscopic examina- tion revealed numerous ova of S. indicum. 3. NEMATODES A. Parasites of the respiratory system Protostrongylus rufescens (Leuckart 1865), the cause of verminous bronchi- tis, was recovered from one goat which contained only six specimens of this parasite in its bronchial tubes. Varestrongylus pneumonicus [Bhalerao, 1932] the common lung nematode of hill goats of these provinces, was curiously enough encountered in one goat only at the slaughter house in Nainital. This parasite has been known to cause fatal verminous pneumonia in hill goats of this province and occasionally also in goats in other provinces. B. Parasites of the alimentary canal (a) Abomasum or fourth stomach Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi 1803), the well-known 'stomach worm ' of ruminants, was present in 80 goats out of 120 examined. Of these, eight showed a very mild degree of infestation, the goats harbouring from 3 to 25 worms. Sixty cases were classed as having a mild infestation, with the count of from 25 to 100 worms. Eight goats had a moderately heavy infes- tation of from 100 to 500, and four were those in which infestations might be said to be fairly heavy with the count of from 500 to 1,500 worms. With the presence of over a thousand worms in the abomasum the only pathological changes noticeable were slight oedema of the mucous coat and a fairly large number of petechial marks studded over the membrane. (b) Duodenum, Jejunum and Ileum Trichostrongylus colubriformis (Giles 1892), the common nematode worm infesting chiefly the duodenum, was collected from 25 goats. In two goats it occurred at the rate of 10 in each, in 10 the number varied from 100 to 500, and 13 animals had a fairly heavy infestation of from 500 to 3,000 worms.
202 Normal Worm Burden of Goats Two goats in which the intensity of infestation was 2,500 in one and 3,000 in the other, shewed pathological changes, confined to a certain portion of the duodenum and consisting of thickening of its wall, the formation of minute petechial marks and the presence of a slimy mucoid material on its mucous membrane. Bunostomum trigonocephalum (Rudolphi 1808), one of the commonest hookworms of ruminants, was encountered in 20 goats of which 2 had 8 para- sites each, 10 had about 50 each, six had 50 to 100 and two animals had 400 parasites each. In every case the parasites occurred in the jejunum or ileum attached to the mucous coat and, apart from local reactions at the sites of attachment, no marked pathological changes were discernible. (c) Caecum and large intestine Oesophagostomum columb anum (Curtice 1890), the common'nodular worm' of sheep and goats in this country, occurred in exactly half the number of goats examined. Differential count of this parasite revealed a wide range of varia- tions in number from 7 to 500 worms. The degree of infestations varied from mild to moderate and heavy, and the number of goats involved in each category being 30, 24 and 6 respectively. Parasitic nodules containing developmental forms of this nematode occurred on the serous coat of the colon and caecum of 13 animals with a mild degree of infestation with the mature forms of the parasite. Goats with heavy infestations revealed thickening and corrugations of the mucosa of caecum and colon, not unlike the lesions of Johne's disease of cattle. Trichuris ovis (Abildgaard 1795) was the most frequently occurring species, as it was present in 93 goats out of 120 examined. The number present in each animal was observed to extend over a wide range from 2 in one goat to 3,000 in a few heavily infested animals. Briefly, 53 animals showed light in- festation, 35 were modertately infested and five showed heavy infestations. No pathological changes of note were seen as a result of infestation with this parasite. REMARKS An important observation based on this survey is that all pathogenic forms of helminth parasites are represented in normal goats. Species of the genera Chabertia, Cooperia and Nematodirus recorded from sheep in this country [Bhalerao, 1935] were not encountered in any of the goats examined. No specimens of Ostertagia were found, although Bhalerao [1935] records the presence of 0. circumcincta from goats at Mukteswar. Similarly, Strongy- loides papillosus (Wedl 1856) was not recorded from any of the goats, al- though Thaper [1939] records its presence in both goats and sheep from Lucknow. The dominant species was Trichuris ovis, infesting 93 goats. This was closely followed by Haemonchus contortus Next in descending order of fre- quency was Oesophagostomum columbianum which occurred in 50 per cent of the goats examined. The remaining species, following a descending scale of frequency, were Stilesia globipunctata, Cysticercus tenuicollis, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Bunostomum trigonocephalum, paramphistomes, Stilesia vittata and Avitellina centripunctata, A. lahorea, Fasciola gigantica, A. sudanea and
P. G. PANDE 203 Schistosoma indicum, Moniezia expansa ; and finally, Protostrongylus rufescens, Varestrongylus pneumonicus, Stilesis hepatica and Coenurus cerebralis were each found on one occasion. This survey reveals the frequency and intensity of occurrence of these parasites in certain districts of the United Provinces, but as the climatic and topographical conditions exerting a powerful influence on these aspects of hel- minthic infestation vary greatly in different parts of the United Provinces and from province to province in this country, more work on these lines in this and other provinces appears to be necessary.

(CAL.), PH.D. (CANTAB.) Assistant Research Officer, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 16 June 1941) (With one text-figure) THE importance of magnesium in animal dietary is now well recognized in the light of the work done by Kruse et al. [1932]. On a low magnesium diet, the deficiency of this mineral in rats [Kruse et al., 1932] and in dogs [Orent et al., 1932] manifests itself generally by trophic disturbances, nutritive failure and by an increased irritability of the nervous system which is characterized by tetany with vasodilation. Even rations containing ten times as much magnesium (10 to 20 parts per million) as those producing these extreme deprivation effects, induce a condition of nervous instability [Greenberg and Tufts, 1935]. Rats on such rations are thrown into convulsions on the application of a suitable stimulus. The plasma magnesium content of these animals, while invariably lower than the content of the controls, falls within the range of variation which has been reported for normal animals. The importance of magnesium in the diet of young calves has also been recognized. When attempts are made to raise calves on milk alone, failure generally results. The animals after a few months are found to suffer from tetany and convulsions [Duncan et al. 1935]. Very young animals may survive several tetanic seizures but animals older than six months usually succumb to the first attack. This type of tetany is also associated with low values for the magnesium content of blood [Huffman and Robinson, 1926] and is relieved by the administration of magnesium salts [Huffman and Duncan, 1936]. Evidently the quantitative requirement of magnesium is higher in calves than in rats, for the latter may be successfully reared on whole milk with supplements only of iron, copper and manganese [Kemmerer et al., 1932]. Low blood magnesium values are also met with in cows suffering from the disease known as grass tetany or lactation tetany [Sjollema, 1930]. This disease occurs principally during the first two weeks after cows are allowed to graze. Tetanic contractions of various muscles are the chief symptoms but the tetany of magnesium deficiency, as seen in rats, and grass tetany are not completely identical, for while serum calcium remains normal in the former, in the latter it is subnormal [Sjollema and Seekles, 1930 ; Seekles et al., 1931]. Allcroft and Green [1938] have also disproved the obligate asso- ciation of hypomagnesaemia with grass tetany, for they found that, whereas animals showing symptoms of grass tetany had a low serum-magnesium value, animals in the same herd having still lower magnesium values in winter did not show any sign of tetany. Their view was that parturition occurring at or near a season of low blood magnesium content precipitates the onset of grass tetany. This view is contradicted by Sjollema [1932], who found that in 357 cases of grass tetany, 55 per cent occurred more than six weeks after calving. Intravenous injections of calcium and magnesium salts have been found to 204
S. N. RAY 205 relieve the symptoms of this disease. The reason for this precipitation of tetany after the animals are allowed to graze on pasture, which is rich in magnesium content, is inexplicable. Hirschfelder [1933] observed a low concentration of magnesium in the serum of patients suffering from eclampsia or epilepsy. McNeille [1934] claims that improvement in these conditions can be effected by injections of magnesium salts. The writer's interest in the relation between hypomagnesaemia and convulsive seizures was aroused by an outbreak of cases of fainting ' fits' in some of the experimental animals of the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. The animals belonged to two experimental groups. The first consisted of five heifers, three on a vitamin A-deficient ration and the other two animals on the same ration plus 50 mg. of carotene per head per day. The vitamin A-deficient animals received daily 6 lb. wheat straw and 3 lb. of a concentrate mixture ' A' composed of: wheat bran 20 parts, oats 25 parts, barley 25 parts, cotton seed meal 15 parts and mustard oil cake 15 parts. In addition, each animal received 1 oz. of calcium carbonate daily and 1 oz. of common salt once a week. The other group was also com- posed of five heifers, three of which were on a protein deficient ration, while the other two, serving as controls, received 3/4 lb. casein in addition to the deficient ration. Each animal on the protein deficient ration received daily 7 lb. wheat straw, 1 oz. calcium carbonate and 3 lb. of a concentrate mixture composed of: yellow maize 34 parts, oats 16 parts, barley 16 parts and molasses 33 parts. In addition, 1 oz. of common salt was given once a week to the animals. All the animals, except one of those on the vitamin A-deficient ration suffered from these ' fits '. Moreover, another heifer on a low phos- phorus and high calcium ration was also showing similar symptoms. A tabular statement of the various animals under observation together with their daily intake of rations is given in Table I.

Usually the animals used to consume the whole amounts of food given to them. Symptoms The animals used to fall down suddenly in a dead faint, with limbs stiff, legs rigid and eyes half closed. There was no struggling or movement at all. The breathing was laboured and occasionally there was foaming at the mouth. The temperature was normal. Insensibility used to last only for five or six minutes except in the case of one animal (H. C. 47) whose case will be described in detail later. After the' fit' the animals used to get up of their own accord but continued to show marked excitement for sometime. They used to feed regularly and the amount taken was more or less normal. Their coats remain- ed glossy in appearance. It was very soon evident that nutrition was an etiological factor in this malady. One of the animals (H. C. 47) was having these ' fits ' more frequently than the others. During the month following the observation of the first seizure, it fainted 13 times and the duration of the 13th seizure was half- an-hour, as contrasted with four or five minutes in the case of the other animals. It was, moreover, the only animal which was found to be losing condition rapidly and it was decided to change its roughage from wheat straw to freshly cured hay. From the day the hay was started to be given to the animal the ' fits ' topped. Ten days subsequently wheat straw was again substituted. After a month the animal began having' fits ' again and suddenly one day it collapsed and died. Post-mortem examination did not reveal any significant macroscopic changes. The only common factor in the diet of all the animals was wheat straw. This straw was practically free from carotene, hence it was at first thought that the ' fits ' were due to vitamin A deficiency. The occurrence, however, of the malady in the animals getting carotene (vitamin A deficiency control group) as well as in the animals of the protein deficiency group, which were receiving yellow maize as part of their concentrate mixture, appeared to dis- count any connection between vitamin A deficiency and the fits. However, in order to make certain that the condition was not one of avitaminosis-A,
S. N. RAY 207 all the animals in the protein deficiency experiment as well as one of the control animals in the vitamin deficiency group were given a daily dose of 4 oz. of a superior quality cod liver oil. Nevertheless, although the medication was continued for a month, these animals still continued to have ' fits ', thus proving that the symptoms had no connection with a vitamin A insufficiency. The chemical examination of the blood revealed a normal level of calcium in the serum. This ruled out any possibility of the ' fits ' being due to calcium deficiency. This result was expected as the composition of the diets contained sufficient calcium and phosphorus in the proportion of 2 : 1. On the other hand, the concentration of magnesium in the blood was found to be definitely low in all the animals. The figures in Table II will illustrate these points.

The magnesium was precipitated from the filtrates obtained from the calcium determinations as magnesium ammonium phosphate and the magnesium calculated from the phosphorus content of the precipitate, determined by Fiske and Subbarow's [1925] method.
208 Hypomagnesaemia in Heifer Calves It will be seen that the calcium concentrations of the sera were all within the normal concentrations usually recorded for such animals, the average value being quite high. The magnesium concentrations on the other hand were very low, when compared with the normal figures of 2 to 3 mg. per 100 c.c. serum (average 2.414 mg.) as given by Duncan et al. [1940]. Indeed the figures show some similarity with those found in animals suffering from grass tetany [Sjollema, 1932] or in epileptic patients [Hirschfelder, 1933]. A closer correlation between the ' fits' and hypomagnesaemia was further indicated by estimating the concentration of magnesium in the serum before and during the fainting fits. The data is given in Table III.* TABLE III Concentration of calcium and magnesium in blood serum before, during and immediately after the fainting fit, expressed in mg. per 100 c.c. serum No. of animals Before fit During fit Immediately after fit Ca.

C. 56 . . 12.2 1.70 10.0 0.70 9.1 1.10 It will be seen that in practioally all cases there was a fall in the magnesium concentration of the blood serum during the occurrence of the ' fits '. In a few cases, the concentration was measured immediately after the symptoms had subsided and an increase was observed in each of these. An interesting feature was that the calcium concentrations were simultaneously lowered in most of the cases, though even these values were definitely within the normal levels prescribed for these animals [Dukes, 1937]. It may also be pointed out that, unlike the magnesium concentrations, the calcium concentrations were not found to go up mmediately after the ' fit'. It may be remembered that substitution of wheat-straw by fresh hay brought about instantaneous relief in one animal. Fresh hay was found to * The figures for calcium and magnesium contents of blood in the ' before fit' column of Table III, represent the amounts present in serum when the animals were quite normal. It was our practice to carry out the estimations of calcium, and magnesium contents of blood serum every fortnight for these animals and the values obtained in the last estimations before the animals started getting fits are given.
S. N. RAY 209 contain quite a high percentage of magnesium, the comparative concentrations in the two roughages being (a) wheat straw210 Hypomagnesaemia in Heifer Calves sufficient for maintenance. Wendt [1925] offered as a standard 0.01 gm. of magnesium per kg. of body weight, which amounts to roughly 4.0 gm. of MgO per day per animal of 500 lb. live weight. Forbes, French and Letonoff [1929] found that on a ration of equal parts of maize meal and alfalfa hay at a level of half maintenance, storage of magnesium occurred with an intake of 9 mg. per kg. body weight. At the same time, these workers observed a negative retention of the mineral when alfalfa hay alone was fed at main- tenance level, although the magnesium intake in the later experiment was as high as 32 mg. per kg. of live weight. Using a basal ration largely or entirely composed of milk, Huffman and Duncan [1936] were able to maintain the magnesium content of blood plasma by administering extra magnesium com- pounds to the extent of 15 to 20 mg. per lb. body weight. If the figures given in Table IV are represented graphically (Fig. 1) it will be noticed that with a feed consisting of grain-mixtures and wheat straw the minimum daily magne- sium requirement works out at 24 mg. of MgO per lb. of body weight. This figure is twice as high as that given by Wendt [1925] or that found by Forbes et al. [1929] on the maize and alfalfa diet. Our figure, however, compares favourably with the figure of Forbes et al. obtained from the alfalfa alone feeding experiment or that of Huffman and Duncan (loc cit.). [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Relation between feed magnesium concentration and magnesium retention
S. N. RAY 211 The cause for these widely divergent figures quoted for magnesium require- ment is probably due firstly to the differences in the requirements of various breeds and types of animals used by the different workers and secondly to the facts that the availability of the magnesium present in different food-stuffs may vary considerably and that the apparent magnesium content of the feed may not be any guide to the amount of magnesium which will be utilized by the animal. This theory is supported by the findings of Carbery, Chatterjee and Talapatra [1937], who found a positive retention of magnesium using 'Aman' paddy straw as a single feed, whereas the administration of 'Aus' paddy straw alone resulted in a deficiency of the mineral in most of the animals, even though the latter feed containd a greater concentration of magnesium. The non-availability of other minerals in the feed is well known. Thus Elvejhem, Hart and Sherman [1933] found the iron in vegetable and animal material available for haemoglobin formation to be only a fraction of the total iron present. Similarly phytin, found in various cereals, is a compound which animals are unable to assimilate. Consequently the phosphorus it contains [Bruce and Callow, 1934] is not available to them. Phytin also contains magnesium and consequently the magnesium present in this form is also lost to the animals. The total quantity of magnesium present as phytin in the feed is, however, comparatively small and hence the content of phytin alone cannot be the sole determinant of the non-availability of this mineral in the ration. If the negative balance of magnesium in animals on feeds such as those used in these experiments is to be explained on the theory of the non- availability of some of the magnesium in the feed, it will be necessary to seek for other compounds besides phytin from which magnesium is not available. SUMMARY The magnesium content of the blood sera of a number of animals suffering from fainting ' fits ' was found to be low. The calcium concentrations were found to be normal. The magnesium concentrations were found to diminish during the fainting periods and to increase immediately after the ' fit'. The symptoms in one of the animals were found to disappear on changing its roughage from wheat-straw to fresh hay. The administration of magnesium carbonate increased the magnesium content of the serum but did not relieve the symptoms of the malady. Metabolism experiments were conducted on four animals and three of them were found to be on a negative balance with reference to magnesium. On the particular feeds used, 24 mg. of MgO per lb. of body weight was found to be just about sufficient to keep the animals in magnesium equilibrium.

Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 13 September 1940) THE importance and application of selected starters in the ripening of cream, in the preparation of cheese and allied products, are too well known to need emphasis, but in so far as their use in the preparation of dahi is concerned, their utility has not been duly appreciated in India. A greater part of the total milk supply in India is consumed as curd or soured milk (dahi) and unlike the practice in most other countries, this product is churned for butter. Curd with poor texture and bad flavour is not acceptable because of its poor palatability and lower butter yield.* Work done in India connected with milk souring is that of Ram Ayyar [1928], which describes the presence in dahi of different types of lactic acid- producing organisms during different seasons, and that of Joshi and Ram Ayyar [1935] and Karnad [1939] on the aroma-producing organisms in dahi. The present work describes investigations on the effect of some pure culture starters alone and in combination on the quality of dahi. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of organisms The lactic acid-producing organisms were isolated from several curd samples collected from the bazaar and houses. These were plated in loop dilutions on purple lactose agar of the following composition :214 Starters in the Preparation of Dahi More than a dozen cultures of acid formers were initially isolated and after a study of their morphological characteristics, three selected forms were identified by their cultural and physiological behaviour [Bergey, 1939] as Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris and Lactobacillus acidophilus.* Since yeasts are found commonly associated with lactic organisms in samples of dahi, a type of yeast (Saccharomyces elipsoides) was also isolated to study its possible effect on the production of aroma and flavour in curd. Trials To test their efficiency in dahi production, the pure cultures were in- oculated both singly and in different combinations into 20 ml. of cold simmered or sterilized milk in conical flasks. Since curd in an Indian house-hold is generally made after simmering the milk, this investigation was carried out in simmered full cream cow's and buffalo's milk. But in order to eliminate the influence of any chance contaminant in simmered milk and to make the conditions technically perfect for the study of pure cultures, a simultaneous study was also conducted in sterilized milk samples. Simmering was done on a low flame for 1½ hours and 20 ml. portions of the simmered milk transferred to sterilized conical flasks. Sterilization of the milk was done at 10 lb. pressure for 10 minutes on two consecutive days in 100 ml. conical flasks, each containing 20 ml. milk. Since 37°C. is the optimum growth temperature for L. acidophilus and 30°C. for the other types, combinations in which L. acidophilus formed one of the types were incubated at both temperatures. The following is the list of the various combinations tried:M. R. MADHOK AND S. L. KAPOOR 215 2. The taste, aroma and flavour of the curds were judged with the kind cooperation of two experienced members of the Department of Agriculture. 3. Determinations of volatile acidity were made after 18 hours' incuba- tion by the method used at the Government laboratory [Richmond, 1930]. RESULTS The results showing the development of acidity, rate of curdling and the amount of volatile acidity developed in different cases are given in Tables I216 Starters in the Preparation of Dahi Similarly A+Y+C developed a higher acidity than L but took a longer time to curdle (Tables I and II). In general it was observed that under similar conditions, relatively longer periods were required for curdling simmered than sterilized milk. Quality of curd To determine the relative quality of the curd produced in different samples the grading of flavour, aroma, appearance, compactness and the texture of the different types was undertaken with the help of experts. For com- parative purposes a few samples from the bazaar and houses were also ex- amined.

STUDIES ON LUPINUS ANGUSTIFOLIUS L. I. A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ON THE USE OF THE SEEDS OF LUP1NUS ANGUSTIFOLIUS AS CATTLE FOOD BY M. R. SUBRAMANIA SASTRY C. K. VELAYUDHAN NAYAR R. RAMASWAMY AND K. VENKATACHALAM The Research Unit, Medical College, Madras (Received for publication on 5 November 1941) (With Plate XVIII) LUPINUS ANGUSTIFOLIUS of the natural order Papilionaceae is a deep-rooted, hardy and spreading bushy annual (Plate XVIII, fig. 1). It is of a typical papilionaceous variety with the characteristic bacterial nodules and is a good, green manure plant. Its deep root-system makes it an effective soil binder. The plant grows to a height of about three feet and has a spread- ing habit. It gives out a large number of branches with profuse foliage on all sides. When grown for green manure purpose, the crop yields about 4000 to 5000 pounds of green stuff per acre. The plants show a preference to deep clayey soils of a low pH value. Flowers are small, axillary, arranged in racemose fashion, and show all the characters typical of the order. Pods are thick and stout and about 2 to 2½ in. long with four to five seeds inside (Plate XVIII, fig. 2). The seeds are round and mottled and have a hard seed-coat. The yield of seeds varies from 500 to 600 lb. per acre. The seeds are reported to be a good substitute for horse-gram and useful as cattle food. The seeds, because of their high protein content (29.74 per cent) according to Wehmer [1929], have attracted much attention as a valuable food material for animals. They are also said to contain a variable amount of alkaloids. The Director of Agriculture, Madras, who was growing a crop of the sweet lupins at the Agricultural Research Station, Nanjanad, on the Nilgiri Hills of the Madras Presidency, in rotation with potato with a view to enrich the soil, wished to know whether the amount of alkaloids present in the seeds would not prove injurious to the health of animals and whether the seeds from this crop could, with safety, be utilized for feeding animals. Investigations were, therefore, undertaken to find out whether these seeds could be safely fed to animals. Isolation of lupanine Eight kilogrammes of the lupin seeds received from the Agricultural Research Station, Nanjanad, were powdered and extracted with 95 per cent alcohol containing one per cent hydrochloric acid by the reserved percolation process. The extraction was continued till the alkaloidal reactions were nega- tive. The first few fractions of the percolate contained mostly fatty matter. The alcoholic extract was evaporated and the residual solution was treated with 3 times its volume of water, kept on a boiling water bath for a few 219
220 Studies on Lupinus angustifolius L. hours, cooled and filtered. The dark yellow filtrate was neutralized with 15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, evaporated to a small volume under re- duced pressure and made alkaline with the same alkali. The alkaline solution was repeatedly extracted with chloroform till a fraction of the extract gave no reaction for alkaloid. The chloroform was distilled off and the residual syrup made slightly acidic with hydrochloric acid and kept in a vacuum desiccator over NaOH. The yield of lupanine hydrochloride obtained by this method varied from 1.5 to 2 gm. Assay of lupin seeds The method followed for the assay of the seeds was that of Thom and Michaelis. 15 gm. of the powdered lupin seeds are well shaken with a mixture of 50 c.c. of ether and 50 c.c. of CHC13. The mixture is treated with 5 c.c. of 15 per cent solution of NaOH and 5 c.c. of water and kept for 24 hours with occasional shaking. 50 c.c. of ether are then added, and after the mixture has been shaken and allowed to settle, 50 c.c. of the clear solution are poured off into a separator. This process is repeated once more. To the combined solu- tions, a further 50 c.c. of ether is added and the liquid washed 3 times with about 20 c.c. of water to remove excess of alkali. The ether-chloroform solu- tion is then shaken with a measured volume (about 30 c.c.) of N/100 hydrochlo- ric acid and then twice with 20 c.c. of water adding the water to the acid- extract. The mixture is then titrated with N/100 NaOH using iodeosin as indicator. A control experiment was carried out without using lupin seed powder. The percentage alkaloidal content of the sample of lupin seeds assayed by the authors by this method is 0.1302. A higher content of the alkaloid has, however, been reported by certain other workers and the disparity may be due to the variations in the alkaloidal content of the seeds themselves as appear to be not improbable from the following findings :M. R. SUBRAMANIA SASTRY AND OTHERS 221 seeds. If the amount of the alkaloid contained in about 2 to 3 lb. of the lupin seeds should prove lethal to a dog weighing about 10 to 1.5 lb., it may then be computed on this basis that, in order that it should prove lethal to a bullock weighing about 300 to 350 lb., the ingestion of the alkaloid contained in 60 to 70 lb. of the seeds will be required. Feeding experiments A goat weighing about 45 lb. was fed with lupin seeds. During the earlier stages of the experiment the seeds were debittered according to the method adopted at the Agricultural Research Station, Nanjanad, by soaking them in cold water for about 24 hours, then boiling for one hour and washing in running water for about 1½ hours. Four ounces (115 grammes) of the seeds were treated in this way and fed, daily for a period of 16 days, the total consumption being 1.84 kilogrammes or roughly about 4 lb. Though the animal had to be hand fed for the first two or three days, it began to eat with relish afterwards. The goat manifested no untoward symptoms and its condition remained normal. This confirms the results of the feeding experiments done at the Agricultural Research Station, Nanjanad, where six pairs of work-bullocks were reported to have been fed, with debittered seeds crushed and mixed with straw, for three months, daily, at 1 lb. per head and no harmful effects were reported to have been observed. The animals are said to have maintained good condi- tion. Apart from confirming the results of the experiments carried out at Nan- janad, raw powdered seeds222 Studies on Lupinus angustifolius L. DISCUSSION It can be seen from the tabular statement that (a) even a small animal as a goat weighing about 45 lb. was able to take upto 1 lb. of the raw powdered seeds without showing any toxic symptoms or any untoward signs except satiation on the 4th day after the feed was raised to 1 lb. a day. It has even shown an increase in weight. (b) no satiation was observed when fed with the seeds up to 12 ounces a day ; from this it may be inferred that the above effect has probably been brought about by the excess of protein matter fed. If 12 ounces cannot pro- duce satiation in a goat weighing about 45 lb., it may reasonably be assumed that about 3 lb. of the raw seeds (i.e. about 4 times the goat's dose) may not produce any such effect in a bullock with an average weight of about 300 lb. The quantity of the seeds that is at present being fed in the Nanjanad farm is only 1 lb. a day for a bullockM. R. SUBRAMANIA SASTRY AND OTHERS 223 debittered seeds on the bullock. Besides, experiments on the goat with raw powdered seeds with the husk intact and without in any way debittering them have also been done and found to produce no harmful effects. It is left to the stock owners to try the results of the latter experiments on bullocks and other large animals and report their observations. Our findings indicate that feeding with these seeds is bound to improve their health and general condition. Investigations on the pharmacolog cal actions of the alkaloid are proceed- ing and the results will be published in a subsequent paper. SUMMARY (i) The alkaloidal content of the lupin seeds received from the Agricul- tural Research Station, Nanjanad was found to be 0.1302 per cent. (ii) The alkaloid lupanine has been isolated from the seeds in yields vary- ing from 1.5 to 2 gm. from 8 kilogrammes of the material. (iii) Debittered seeds fed to the goat did not produce any untoward symp- toms. (iv) Seeds fed with the husk intact and without being debittered also did not produce any bad symptoms when given in quantities up to 12 ounces a day ; but showed satiation on the 4th day after the feed was raised to 1 lb. a day. (v) 25 to 50 milligrammes of the alkaloid, administered intravenously to dogs weighing about 10 to 15 lb., caused a definite fall in the blood-pressure and a dose of 100 to 150 milligrammes (1½ to 2¼ grains) proved lethal and it is inferred that the alkaloid contained in 60 to 70 lb. or even more of the seeds would be required to prove lethal to a bullock weighing about 300 to 350 lb. (vi) The alkaloids of the seeds do not appear to produce any cumulative effects. (vii) Debittering of the seeds does not appear to be necessary and they may, with safety, be fed raw (even with the husk intact)STUDIES ON VEGETABLE RENNET BY RAMJI NARAIN, PH.D., D.Sc. Second Agricultural Chemist, Punjab AND ATAM SINGH, B.Sc.(AG.) Agricultural Research Institute, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 21 August 1941) CHEDDAR cheese is a well-known milk product whose importance lies not only in its nutritive value but also in its better keeping quality. Of the other preparations of milk very largely used in India, ghee lacks the milk proteins of a high biological value much needed in the diet, particularly of vegetarians ; while khoa and curd cannot be easily preserved over long periods. Unfortunately, however, the use of cheese prepared by the usual method of coagulating the milk with rennet derived from the stomach of the calf is held to be objectionable by a large section of the Indian population. In order to make such a useful product acceptable to this class of people, a search was made for a milk coagulating agent of purely vegetable origin which could be used for the preparation of cheese on a commercial scale. Knowledge of plants possessing the property of coagulating milk dates from the sixteenth century. Green [1893] mentions its presence in Gallium varum the juice of which was described by Methelo in the sixteenth century ' Galium inde nomen sortitum est suum quod lac coagulet '. Martin [1885] and Baginski [1882-83] refer to the presence of such an agent in Carica papaya. Lea [1883] extracted the active principle from the berries of Withania coagulans with glycerine and sodium chloride solution. Christen and Virasoro [1935] were able to obtain an active preparation from the flowers of thistle. A large number of plants has been studied at this Institute, with the object of selecting one capable of giving a preparation possessing active coagulating powers. Amongst others the enzyme had been found to be present in Madica- go sativa, Lolium perenne, Androprogan schisenan, Ficus palmata, Ficus carica, Withania somnifora and Withania coagulans. The enzyme from the first three plants was found to be much less active than from the last four. Again it was much more active in the latex of Ficus palmata and Ficus carica than in the juice of these plants, a drop of the latex being sufficient to coagulate 10 c.c. of milk in two to three minutes. The latex from Ficus palmata, however, imparts a very bitter taste to the curd and the separation of the active rennet from the latex, owing to the great amount of labour and expense involved in its collection, was not economical. The latex from Ficus carica, however, be- sides being highly active, is free from this bitterness of taste. This plant grows 224
RAMJI NARAIN AND ATAM SINGH 225 wild in the central and southern Punjab, but owing to the laborious process of collecting its latex, it did not prove to be an economical source. The search was, therefore, further extended to Withania somnifora and Withania coagulans. Both these plants produce berries, different parts of which contain different amounts of rennet of varying activity but Withania coagulans possesses berries containing much larger amounts of the active principle. The fact that the dried berries of Withania coagulans are not only rich in this enzyme but are also easily obtainable in the market at all times of the year, weighed consider- ably in the final selection of this material for the preparation of rennet. This paper describes the different methods of extracting the enzyme, its characteristic properties and its use in the preparation of cheddar cheese. EXPERIMENTAL A. Preparation of vegetable rennet from Withania coagulans The berries of Withania Coagulans consist of husk, seeds and the resinous material in which the seeds are embedded. The activity of the extract ob- tained from the husks and the seeds is almost equal, while that of the extract from the resinous material is four times high. Separation of the seed is, however, tedious, hence resin along with the embedded seed, after being freed from the surrounding husk, was used for the preparation of the enzyme extract. Kothavalla and Khubchandani [1940] had prepared an extract with 5 per cent sodium chloride and used it as such for the preparation of cheese. Our ex- perience had shown, however, that the saline extract so prepared contained a bitter substance and the resulting curd possessed a similar taste and an un- pleasant flavour. Consequently, a number of methods was employed to obtain a preparation free from this defect. As mentioned already by Russel [1937], we were able to obtain an active preparation capable of coagulating 25000 parts of milk in 40 minutes. The preparation was free of all traces of bitter taste or of undesirable flavour. The following methods of extracting the enzyme were used :226 Studies on Vegetable Rennet The activity of the product obtained by the three methods of preparation described above was compared with the following results : Activity at 30°C*. Yield per 100 gm. of berries gm. a. Salting out . . . . . 8200 5.2 b. Dialysis . . . . . . 15000 27000RAMJI NARAIN AND ATAM SINGH 227 It will be seen from the above that the optimum temperature for the action of the vegetable rennet is in the neighbourhood of 70°C. The activity increases with a rise in temperature up to 70°C. beyond which it shows a falling off till 80°C. is reached when it is altogether destroyed. Working with rennets of animal origin Fleischmann [1876] found the optimum temperature of calf's rennet to be 41 °C., while according to Waksman and Davison [1926] it is 45°C. Euler [1910] gives it between 37°C. and 39°C. Chodat and Rouge [1906] find the optimal temperature for syko-chymase from Ficus carica to be between 75°C. and 80°C., while for rennet from Witha- nia coagulans it is about 70°C. Evidently the optimal temperature for vege- table rennets is much higher than for animal rennets and this fact seems to have some relationship with the body temperatures of animals and plants. Plants are exposed to the direct heat of the sun which in a torrid climate rises to about 60°C. or even more. It has been found that the temperature of the plant is not very widely different from the temperature of its environment and the period of the metabolic activity of the plant synchronizes with that of the photosynthetic activity. The economy of the plant therefore demands that the chemical reactions going on within its tissues should be able to adjust themselves in accordance with the temperature of its environment. Similar adjustment of the activity of the enzymes to changes in environmental con- dition was noticed by Narain [1918] in his studies of the change of activity of the oxidizing enzymes in the sugarcane as a result of changes in the reaction of media. In order to determine the correlation between the activity of the enzyme and the temperature of reaction mixture, another similar experiment was performed under strictly controlled experimental conditions at 5°C. intervals of temperature. In the case of animal rennet it has been found by Grimmer et al. [1925, 1928] that between the range 20°-38°C. the duration of coagulation is a logarithmic function of the temperature, of the following form :228 Studies on Vegetable Rennet temperatures, a series of experiments was carried out, which gave the follow- ing results :RAMJI NARAIN AND ATAM SINGH 229 (d) Influence of the reaction of the medium.230 Studies on Vegetable Rennet The data presented show that sodium chloride when present in amounts not greater than that required to make a 0.125N solution does not affect the rate of coagulation but higher concentrations of the salt exercise an increas- ingly inactivating effect. For example, the duration of coagulation is doubled with milk which is normal with respect to sodium chloride. Calcium chloride in concentrations upto N/1 does not inhibit the process of coagulation. On the other hand, it hastens the action of rennet especially in concentrations between 0.033-0.1 Normal, where the time of coagulation is reduced to about one-third of that with normal milk. Within this range (.033N-0.lN) the varia- tion in the amount of calcium chloride has little effect. (f) Influence of concentration of the enzyme.RAMJI NARAIN AND ATAM SINGH 231 where M is the volume of undiluted milk, V that of the diluted milk, and t and t' the time of coagulation of the diluted and undiluted milk respectively. This is shown by the following figures :232 Studies on Vegetable Rennet was found to coagulate one pound of milk with an acidity of 0.2 per cent in 75 minutes. They further found that a larger quantity of the extract pro- duced an unpleasant flavour in the cheese characteristic of the berries and a low temperature increased the time of coagulation. To reduce the latter a larger quantity of rennet was required but it affected the flavour. At a higher temperature the curd was unsuitable for cheese. For making cheddar cheese they found that a temperature of 105°F. gave a curd which compared favour- ably with the one obtained with animal rennet at 86°F. We have found that 1.2 gm. of the enzyme (prepared by the method described by us) with an activity of 25,000 is able to coagulate 60 lb. of milk with an acidity of 0.21 per cent in 45 minutes under the usual conditions of temperature. The curd obtained is quite firm and free from bitter taste or unpleasant flavour. During the last four years we have been making cheddar cheese with this preparation and have encountered no difficulty at any stage of the process and the final product has been found to be as good as that pre- pared from animal rennet. SUMMARY In order to find out a substitute of vegetable origin for animal rennet for the preparation of cheese, a number of plants were studied. The dried berries of Withania coagulans were found to be the best source. An active preparation of the enzyme free from the bitter taste of the berries was prepared by extracting these with 20 per cent alcohol and precipitating the enzyme with further addition of commercial alcohol. The characteristic properties of the enzyme have been studied. It has been found that : (a) the enzyme is very sensitive to changes in the temperature of the reacting mixtures, the reaction of the medium and the presence of salts, (b) pre-heating of milk, depending upon the temperature used, retards the activity of the enzyme, (c) the velocity of coagulation varies not only with the concentration of the enzyme but also of the substrate, (d) radiations of different wave lengths corresponding to indigo, blue, green, yellow and red lights as well as direct sunlight have no influence on the activity of the enzyme, Using vegetable rennet, cheddar cheese was prepared under the usual conditions of temperature. The cheese thus obtained was found to be as good as that prepared with animal rennet. REFERENCES Baginsky, A. (1882-83). Z. physiol Chem. 7, 209 Beau, M. (1935).

A SEMI-MICRO METHOD FOR ESTIMATING ALLANTOIN AND ITS EXCRETION IN THE URINE OF FARM ANIMALS BY S. C. RAY, M.Sc., PH.D., A.I.C. Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 22 September 1941) EXTENSIVE studies on the nitrogenous material catabolized during a nitrogen-free dietary regime have been carried out. On the basis of reports of previous work Terroine [1933] concluded that endogenous nitrogen- metabolism arises from two sources : (1) from body protein catabolism as represented by urinary metabolites such as urea, amonia and amino-acids, and (2) from cellular catabolism as represented by urinary metabolites such as creatinine, creatine, allantoin and other purines. Although it is now well known that allantoin represents by far the largest purine constituent in the urine of ruminants, studies on endogenous nitrogen-metabolism in farm ani- mals have been much handicapped through lack of a satisfactory method for estimating allantoin in urine. Published methods for estimating allantoin may be classified as follows:S. C. RAY 235 reagent is not only reduced by allantoin but also by other constituents of urine such as sugar, creatine and creatinine when they are present in more than certain minimal amounts. The following method for the determination of allantoin has been evolved in view of the limitations and short-comings of the earlier methods. The method is in reality a simple and workable combination of the Larson and Handovsky-Wiechowski techniques. Outline of the proposed method The urine is subjected to clarification from interfering substances on the same principle as that used by Larson. The clear liquid is then carefully made just pink to phenolphthalein with an alkali solution. The allantoin is precipi- tated from this medium by adding a known excess of allantoin reagent contain- ing mercuric acetate. The precipitate is filtered off and the excess mercuric ion in the filtrate is titrated against a standard thiocyanate solution, with ferric alum as indicator. The ferric indicator used in this method gives a sharp end- point. The estimation of allantoin in six samples can be completed in less than 1½ hours. The reagents (1) Phospho-tungstic acid:236 Allantoin in the Urine of Farm Animals acidify with N/10 sulphuric acid and finally just pink to phenolphthalein with N/10 caustic soda. Rinse the sides of the flask with a little distilled water and then add 10 ml. allantoin reagent. Stopper the flask, shake the contents and make up to the volume with distilled water. Mix thoroughly by gently inverting the flask several times. Leave the flask in a dark place for 20 minutes to allow the precipitate to settle. Filter into a dry Erlenmeyer flask. Take duplicates of 10 ml. filtrate in glazed porcelain basins, add 2 ml. ferric indicator and titrate with N/40 ammonium thiocyanate solution from a 5 ml. micro- burette. During the titration, stir the contents in the basin constantly with a glass rod. The end-point is indicated at the moment when the solution turns to a chocolate-brown colour. Calculation : 10 ml. allantoin reagent is equivalent to 25.08 ml. N/40 ammonium thiocyanate solution, so that 25.08S. C.

When these calculated values are com- pared with the values actually estimated, by the respective methods, it will be seen that the maximum percentage difference between the calculated and the estimated value is only 1.9 in the case of the proposed method, while the same is so wide as 15.2 in the case of Larson's method. The lower values actually estimated in these samples by the latter method are due to partial elimination, by dilution with water or pure allantoin solution, of constituents other than allantoin, which could react with the ammoniacal copper reagent. In fact, it was possible to demonstrate that such consti- tuents could be creatine and preformed creatinine in cow's urine, which contributed from + 1 to + 28 per cent positive error, according to the quantity present under different physiological and nutritional conditions. Excretion of allantoin in the urine of ruminants It has already been pointed out that there are few published reports on the quantitative excretion of allantoin by farm animals. Hunter and Givens [1914] have given figures for allantoin and other purine bodies (uric acid and purine base) in the urine of cows, goats and sheep which are now generally accepted. The figures for allantoin obtained by these workers were based upon the method proposed by Handovsky [1914] with slight modifications. In order to compare the values of allantoin given by Hunter and Givens with those obtainable by the present method, a number of urine samples were analy- sed for allantoin. The average value of all estimations for each animal are shown in Table III.

PHOSPHATASE IN FAECES BY S. C. RAY, M.Sc., PH.D., A.I.C. Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 22 September 1941) IT appears to be an accepted fact that the enzyme phosphatase is present in an active form in the intestinal mucosa of animals and Cayla [1935] is of the opinion that bile favours both the secretion and activation of this enzyme, which subsequently plays an important rôle in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the middle and lower intestinal regions. Accord- ing to Verzár [1936], the enzymes secreted by the intestine for digestive pur- poses are not ordinarily re-absorbed but pass out in the faeces. It seems pro- bable, therefore, that a study of the activity of the enzyme phosphatase in faeces may give interesting information on the problem of calcium and phos- phorus absorption from the intestine. In a recent publication Duckworth and Godden [1941] have shown that in rats large increases in faecal phosphatase excretion take place when the fibre intake is raised. From the results obtained, the authors have expressed the view that studies of faecal phosphatase excre- tion may be valuable aids in investigations of secretory activities of the intes- tinal tract. In order to study the subject, an investigation was carried out to determine the faecal phosphatase of normal animals under different physiological condi- tions. In this preliminary paper, a method of determining the activity of faecal phosphatase is described and some data are given, showing the phos- phatase content in goats faeces under normal condition and the effect on its excretion during prolonged fast. Method of determining the activity of faecal phosphatase The faeces of a 24-hour collection was thoroughly mixed and a sample242 Phosphatase in Faeces After 24 hours, the suspension was again shaken. A portion of it was centrifuged for half an hour and the centrifugate was carefully filtered through a Whatman filter No. 42 (7 cm.). The process of filtration was slow, about 5 ml. being collected in 15 to 20 minutes. A clear but slightly coloured filtrate was obtained and the phosphatase determination in the filtrate was made by the Bodansky [1932-33] method. The procedure may be briefly described as follows : In a 30 ml. test tube, 10 ml. of buffered substrate was placed. The subs- trate is a 0.5 per cent solution of sodium-B-glycerophosphate adjusted to pH 8.6 with the buffer salt monosodium diethylbarbiturate. The substrate was brought to 37° C. by placing the tube for a few minutes in the incubator bath and then 1 ml. of the faecal extract was added to it. The tube was then returned immediately to the incubator and left there for exactly an hour. At the end of this time, the tube was immersed in an iced bath and 9 ml. of 10 per cent trichloracetic acid was added to its contents and thoroughly mixed. The solution in the tube was filtered through a Whatman filter No. 42 (7 cm.) and the inorganic phosphorus in the filtrate was estimated by the method described by Bodansky [1932-33]. Simultaneously with the incubated sample, a blank was run to estimate the inorganic phosphorus in 1 ml. of the faecal extract. The difference in the inorganic phosphorus content between the incubated sample and the blank gave the amount of sodium-B-glycerophosphate hydrolysed by enzyme in 1 ml. extract. Usually in 1 ml. of the extract of normal faeces, the inorganic phosphorus content was negligible and its estimation in the blank was unnecessary. In the extract of faeces voided during the period of starvation, however, a signifi- cant amount of inorganic phosphorus was found. It was considered safe to test the presence of inorganic phosphorus in the faecal extract before running the blank. The filtrates collected for estimating inorganic phosphorus, both from incubated and blank samples, were pale yellow in colour. This however, did not seriously interfere with the reading of the final blue colour of the solu- tion in a Leitz (Wetzlar) colorimeter, fitted with an appropriate colour filter. To read the blue colour correctly in an ordinary colorimeter, it was found necessary to eliminate the last trace of colouring matter from the trichloracetic acid filtrate. The elimination was carried out by ultrafiltering the filtrate from a semi-permeable collodion membrane by external pressure. The techni- que of ultrafiltration adopted was that described by Duckworth [1935]. A sufficient quantity of crystal clear ultrafiltrate could be collected in half an hour. During this interval, no hydrolysis of the ester phosphorus in the dilute acid medium was detected, nor did the ultrafiltration appreciably affect the distribution of the phosphate ion on either side of the membrane.

246 Phosphatase in Faeces Experiment 2.S. C. RAY 247 Table III shows that, whereas the intensities of phosphatase excretion amongst the different animals per unit of dry food varied within a compara- tively narrow range, the producing animals, namely goats 2, 3 and 4 excreted significantly more units of phosphatase per kilogram of body weight than goat 1, which was an adult non-producing animal. If one accepts the view that the enzyme phosphatase excreted in faeces is of endogenous origin, it appears that, when the nature of the feed remains the same, the activity of the enzyme is increased simultaneously with the higher rate of productive meta- bolism, in which increased amounts of phosphorus and calcium naturally have to play their part. In experiment 2, as the quantity of faeces voided diminished, the number of absolute units of phosphatase similarly declined. More significant in this connection is the fact that under the condition of effective fasting, phosphatase excreted per gram of dry matter in faeces was also greatly reduced. From an average of 23 units, it was reduced to 6.0 and 8.5 units respectively for goats 1 and 2 during the last four days of fast and 5.1 and 5.2 units respectively for goats 3 and 4 during the last seven days of fast. This finding is contrary to what Smith, Howat and Ray [1938] observed in the case of phosphatase in cow's milk. In milk, with the progress of the fast, although the number of absolute units of phosphatase was greatly reduced with the reduced yield, the units of phosphatase per 100 ml. of milk was very considerably increased to- wards the end of the period. On the other hand the phosphatase in blood- serum, under the fasting condition of the present experimental animals, as well as of sheep and of milch cows, showed definite decrease as could be evi- denced from the data presented by Morris and Ray [1939]. These results tend to show that the activity of the enzyme from different sources does not follow the same course under the same physiological conditions. The milk phospha- tase is perhaps independent of the general cellular activity, and is specifically connected with milk secretion alone. The lowered activity of faecal phosphatase under the fasting condition can be explained by Cayla's theory, according to which, bile is the controlling factor in the secretion and activation of intestinal phosphatase. Since it is well known that during an effective fast, the biliary activity is greatly reduced, the lowered activity of phosphatase may be due to diminished bile secretion. The lowered activity may also be ascribed to the general inhibition of the cellular activities brought about by inanition. SUMMARY A method of measuring the activity of phosphatase in faeces has been described. A preliminary study of the faecal phosphatase excretion during normal metabolism and during a prolonged fast shows that under normal conditions, animals excrete a significant amount of this enzyme in their faeces but that this excretion is considerably reduced during a prolonged fast.

ABSTRACTS Genetics and livestock production. F. W. DRY (1938). Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, New Zealand, Bulletin No. 64250 ABSTRACTS whore the covering was left than on the side shorn in the ordinary way. This suggests a method of camouflaging the genetic make-up by a device to which it may perhaps be deemed not in the public interest to draw attention. The present point is that this is one out of a number of lines of evidence showing that degree of hairiness depends on the interplay of genetic and non-genetic forces. For fertility in sheep the same story can be told. Investigators in a number of countries, including Lamont in New Zealand, have shown that heredity counts, but the practice of flushing is a testimony to nutrition. Indeed, flushing is sometimes purposely avoided in a highly fertile breed in order to reduce the danger of unwanted triplets. Environmental conditions operating before birth are also important. Statistical work (Chapman and Hall) has shown that variance in the birth weight of lambs, a part from the reduction of weight due to twinning, is largely brought about by non-genetic factors. Recent research at Lincoln College (Leslie and McLean) gives us reason to believe that the plane of nutrition before birth influences not only birth weight but subsequent rate of gain, and also suggests that an improvement in the level of nutrition about six weeks before birth slightly increases the abundance of halo-hairs, a feature which the Massey College work has shown to be strongly hereditary. In long-sustained work on pie-bald guinea-pigs, Wright has established a conclusion on the relation between age of dam and amount of white in the offspring. As the age of the mother increased from less than six months to more than twenty-one months the amount of white in the young clearly increased. Beware, therefore, of attributing to genetic factors too large a share of the variation in a colour pattern. This list of examples has been given to show the need for distinguishing between the effects of the internal and the external. In so far as we cannot do this, breeding progress is checked, so that the disentangling of what comes from within and what from without may well be accepted as a first-class problem in genetics. We will therefore list the lines of attack which are appropriate, though these are obvious enough. Firstly, control the breeding. Breed different stocks in the same environment, and if the differences with which you start persist down the generations the conclusion is clear. This is a starting project for the geneticist occupied with livestock, to find out simply whether a character is inherited. He may not be able to identify individual factors, but if he can show by mating like with like that genetic factors play an important or appre- ciable part in determining whether pigs are long or short, and whether wool has lustre or lacks it, that is useful and a beginning. Sometimes you get surprises, selection being ineffective, there being no correlation between characterization of parents and of offspring. From Wensleydale flock records, which it was the author's privilege to analyse, it was shown that ewes of low fertility produced daughters which themselves averaged as high a figure for fertility as the daughters of more fertile ewes. High fertility is inherited, and so it is believed that the whole flock was permeated with a factor or factors for high fertility, so that low produc- tion of lambs by an individual ewe was a matter of chance. Secondly, vary the environment. Use by preference stock as homogenous as possible, closely inbred stock being favoured. Failing even stock, resort may be had to large numbers. With due precautions the same animal may be treated differently at different times. Or, as in differential shearing experiments, use different parts of the same animal at the same time. Nature sometimes makes us a present of handy experimental material in ' identical twins', twins resembling one another with extreme closeness, which have developed from a single fertilized egg, which by a split at an early stage of development has given rise to two individuals identically endowed. Casual inspection of the contents of peram- bulators, confirmed by statistics shows that identical twins are very common. The two members of the pair are of the same sex. ' Fraternal twins ' differ as do brothers and sisters born at different times, and may be of like or unlike sex. The careers of identical twins reared apart have been followed, and the histories of identical and frater- nal twins have been compared. It has been shown clearly that both nature and nurture are important in influencing both intellectual ability and temperament, and that an im- portant role in the producton of crime must be ascribed to heredity. Studies of twins have also afforded evidence that susceptibility to tuberculosis is inherited. Medical
ABSTRACTS 251 men have long believed this, but the greater concordance in tuberculosis infection in identical twins than in fraternal twins gives solid backing to this belief. The weight of the evidence is increased by cases in which the site of infection and other details are very similar. An example chosen from plants will show how the interrelation between nature and nurture affects profit and loss. Certain native sugar-canes in India yielded 10 to 12 tons an acre. The plant breeders got busy and produced new canes which, with heavier manuring, better regulated irrigation, and other superior care, gave up to 35 tons. The ' improved canes ' were useless in the original conditions, and under the higher standard of management the old canes failed to ripen and gave very low sucrose content. So closely interlinked are the efforts of plant breeder and plant husbandman. The internal and external had to change in harmony. For progress in animal or plant breeding the geneticist must cooperate with workers in other branches of agricultural science. Intimate knowledge is needed252 ABSTRACTS Inbreeding, as Lush has expressed it in a simple phrase, is the mating of closely related individuals, but where to draw the line in using the terms ' inbreeding' and 'close breeding ' is a matter of personal preference. The basic fact about inbreeding is that it increases homozygosity. Inbreeding notorioulsy has its risks. In our own species many close matings are forbidden by one code or another, and marriages between cousins are often viewed with disfavour. The chief reason for any calamitous results of inbreeding is that undesirable recessive factors inherited by both the breeding animals from a common ancestor are apt to be passed on by both to the offspring, and so come to light. Many recessive factors are less desirable in their effects than their dominant allelomorphs, and with dominance, either complete or partial, two doses of a factor do not produce twice the effect of one dose. Inbreeding therefore tends to lower the average merit of a stock. On the practical side, inbreeding has been exploited more in self-fertilizing plants than in live-stock. In livestock a beginning has been made in this direction, notably in pigs in America, where brother-sister matings have been made for some generations. Some inbred strains have collapsed. Others have come to consist of quite good and very uniform animals. And a cross between inbred strains has resulted in animals with greater rates of gain. Once again we have to think about dominance. When it comes to out-crossing again after inbreeding, it is convenient if the desirable traits of the inbred stock are dominant. Factors for high production do appear to be dominant more often than not. This seems to be so in milk production. In wool characters we should be on the look-out for some recessive factors determining pleasing features. For one reason, taking hairiness, there are grounds for regarding the production of medulla as a vigorous thing on the part of the follicle, and evidence from breeding results partly in this country, partly elsewhere, suggests that in different pairs of factors a dominant partner may tend to hairiness or a dominant partner may tend to pure wool. Therefore, if inbreeding for pure wool be undertaken, this should be done on a number of different foundations. As experimental material for studying both genetic and non-genetic factors, and for disentangling one from the other, inbred stock is highly important. Selection is rendered much less effective if we cannot allow for environmental conditions ; and how shall we learn the effects of varying feeding if we cannot say what was the genetic endowment ? Inbreeding is already under way in experimental sheep, and it is likely to play a prominent part inwool research. Pedigree.ABSTRACTS 253 To its offspring, as we know, the animal hands on only half its complement factors, but to different children it passes on an assortment of assortments of half its genes, a half which varies from one germ cell to another. We thus have the chance to see the effects of genes hidden in the parent. This illustrates why we can learn more from a collection of offspring of a breeding animal about its genetic worth than by measuring its own merits. Arresting examples of the success of progeny testing are to be found in success- ful poultry breeding. Then breeding animals of both sexes were selected on the egg- laying performances of their daughters, and in two years production was nearly doubled, and remained at that high level. Great results have also been obtained in breeding for production in dairy cattle. One limitation of progeny testing as we here observe, is the simple fact that it takes time. In recent research in Russia (Moisseiev) rams were judged on their success in siring offspring of good size. A high correlation was demonstrated between live weight at weaning and live weight at a year or fourteen months. By thus evaluating the rams early, a few weeks before the ewes were due to be mated again, a breeding season was saved. A bull may raise production when mated with poor-yielding cows and lower it with high-yielding cows. And a bull may lower butterfat when given excellent cows and still be very good254 ABSTRACTS yield. Now, bulls notoriously possess sweat glands, so might it not be possible to judge their innate dairy worth in some such fashion ? That would take us a certain distance, though not the whole way, towards revealing the bulls endowment for milk, and would help us to pick out bulls hopeful for commercial purposes and promising for progeny testing. [R. L. K.] Artificial insemination in livestock breeding. W. V. LAMBERT AND FRED F. MACKENZIE. U. S. A. Deptt. of Agriculture, Circular No. 567 THIS article deals in detail with the advantages of artificial insemination in all classes of domesticated animals and the development in the methods of application of its technique to animal breeding. Although various obstacles stand in the way of the extensive use of artificial insemination, the studies by various workers in Russia and in other countries reveal that the careful coordination of the collection, despatch and use of semen and the use of improved methods of preservation and despatch by sea or air have brought within the realm of possibility the application of insemination to a large number of distant herds. A ram's semen shipped from England to Poland was success- fully used in impregnating ewes after 27 hours, and in the Argentine the successful im- pregnation of a cow was obtained after the seventh day of the collection of semen. Soviet workers report that in 1935, 15,000 ewes were inseminated by a single ram, with an average percentage of conception of 96.6. It is also stated that the percentage of conception of 50 to 60 in mares through normal mating can be raised to a great extent by bringing about artificial impregnation when the chances of conception are the greatest, i.e. a few hours in advance of ovulation. In America the significance of this operation in animal breeding has been understood by many agriculturists and dairy owners. Many of the recently organized Cooperative Dairy Breeding Associations whose main object is to obtain for their members the services of proved sires at a reason- able cost, strongly advocate the use of artificial insemination. The operation is carried out by skilled veterinarians. The chief factors of importance for the successful use of this method in these breeding associations are a sufficient number of animals in the associations justifying the purchase of superior sires and a sufficient number of females to be inseminated, so that the operation can be easily performed without any wastage. Various advantages of artificial insemination have been enumerated. It is not only described as an available means of making the fullest use of proved sires of all species whose reproductive life is generally short, but also as a means of solving many problems of breeding arising out of anatomical defects, age, difference in size and monogamous species. It must be emphasized that a successful operation demands great skill, care, technique and thorough knowledge of the anatomical structure of the genital organs and the physiology of the oestral cycle. Two distinctive operations are involved in the process of artificial insemination. The first is the collection of semen from the male and the second is the insemination of the female. Of the various methods employed in the collection of semen, the one by means of an artificial vagina has come into extensive use in large-scale operations, es- pecially in Russia. The apparatus consists essentially of a thin rubber tube kept warm by a jacket of warm water or air. The outer casing of heavy rubber, glass, ebonite or metal has an inner sleeve attached in such a manner that a watertight space is created between the two cylinders. One end of the inner tube is open to receive the semen from the male and the other end tapers into a graduated glass container. The tempera- ture of the water in the jacket is maintained at 38°-41°C. and the aperture of the inner tube, after proper lubrication with gum Tragacarth in glycerine, is so regulated as to afford adequate pressure and warmth to the penis of the male. By this method, practically the entire ejaculate free from extraneous secretion and in sterile condition is obtained. The chances of the spread of diseases such as Trichomoniasis, etc. are con- siderably reduced and the sperms remain viable for a longer period. Artificial vaginas can be used with sires of all species.
ABSTRACTS 255 The semen may also be collected from the vagina of females after actual mating. It is, however, not necessary in most species to have females in heat for the purpose, as most males may be easily trained to mount a female out of heat. The semen is re- covered from the vagina by a suitable syringe or a spoon, but the quantity collected is usually small and mixed with vaginal secretion which is deterimental to the storage of sperm. A Breeder's bag can only be used for stallions and jacks. It permits the collection of a whole ejaculate in practically uncontaminated condition. The method of ejacu- lation by manipulation has been successfully used in cattle, dogs and fowls. In bulls, an arm is inserted in the rectum. The seminal vesicle and the ampullae of the vas de- ferens are located and massaged by backward strokes and the semen is expelled. It requires great experience and technique for such collection. Similarly in dogs the base of the penis is gently massaged, inducing erection and ejaculation. In poultry, the copulatory organ is made to protrude by rapid massaging of the soft part of the abdomen. It is then held by the thumb and the forefinger, and the semen is gently squeezed out. In Australia, a laboratory method of collection of semen by electrical stimulation has been devised and used successfully in rams. This process, however, is not suitable for all species. Before insemination is carried out, the examination of semen is essential, as it deter- mines the volume, colour, cloudiness, consistency, motility, the number of sperms per cubic millimeter, freedom from contamination, hydrogen ion concentration and the rate of respiration of the sperm. The volume of semen, which is generally measured in a graduated bottle, is of great importance, as the number of inseminations depends on the quantity and the percentage of active sperms per cubic millimeter. Generally the cal- culation of volume is made on the total ejaculate produced in a given interval of time on several occasions. The colour and consistency indicate the quality of sperm. A sample of sperm of the whole ejaculate is taken and the motility, the number of sperms per cubic centimeter and other abnormalities, if any, are examined under a microscope, keeping the same at a constant temperature between 38°C. and 40°C. on a hollow ground slide. Three types of motility have been observed, such as (1) progressive motion in straight line, (2) rotary motion in a circle and (3) convulsive and oscillatory motion with- out change of place. As the motility determines the vitality of the sperm, many arbi- trary gradings have been suggested by various workers, based upon a discrimination between various types of motility and the proportion of sperms exhibiting the respective types. However, the best grade sample of semen is one which contains the largest num- ber of sperms showing progressive motility. Physiological, anatomical and pathological abnormalities of spermatozoa having a direct bearing on low fertility are also observed. Abnormal sperms in bulls and rams should not exceed 17 per cent. However, the per- centage of abnormal sperms is said to depend on the breeding season, previous sexual activity and methods employed for semen collection. The state of breeding activity of a ram tends to influence the abnormal sperm content as, according to certain authors, the first ejaculate after a prolonged sexual rest contains a larger percentage of abnormal sperms. This is said to be due to the sperms undergoing slow degeneration in the epi- didymis and vas deferens. Examination of sperm for abnormalities is made by making a smear of well-mixed material, with a coverslip, and then staining when dry with 0.5 per cent alcohol solution of Gentian violet, for three minutes. The other methods of staining are as follows:256 ABSTRACTS organs of the male. For semen collected from the vagina direct, the possibility of con tamination by bacteria in the vaginal secretion should be excluded by previous examina- tion of the vagina and the adoption of necessary precautions. The hydrogen ion concentra- tion is determined by the use of an electric potentimeter with calomel cell and quin- hydrone. A more recent and critical method of evaluating the quality of sperm has been evolved by gauging the respiration of spermatozoa. The correlation of sperm respiration with breeding performance provides a reliable index of fertility. The methods of insemination in different species of females are essentially the same. Females in heat are selected and properly secured. A vaginal speculum is inserted and the cervix is exposed and the required quantity of diluted semen is introduced, either in gelatine capsules or by means of an inseminator. The best results with artificial insemination are obtained by introducing semen well into the cervix, or with some species direct into the uterus. Vaginal inseminations do not record a high percentage of success. Inseminations should either coincide with ovulation or precede it by a few hours as the life of spermatozoa in the reproductive tract of the female is relatively short. As ovulation generally occurs late in the oestrum, the insemination should be timed to coincide closely with it. In practice the latter half of the oestrum has been found to be the best time for insemination. Two or more inseminations are indicated in a female with a long period of oestrum. In mares over 80.5 per cent of pregnancies were obtained by mating them 4 to 48 hours before ovulation as determined by palpation of maturing follicle. Mares begin to go out of heat from 6 to 18 hours after ovulation and they refuse to accept the stallion after 24 to 48 hours. Investigations, however, show that repeated service during the latter half of the oestrum in all species of animals ensures a larger number of successful impregnations. The quantity of semen to be used in artificial insemination depends on many factors, e.g. the quality of semen, the number of viable sperms, the stage of oestrus, the state of the reproductory organs of the female and the region where the semen is introduced. The quantities of semen found adequate for impregnating females of different species of domestic animals are given as :ABSTRACTS 257 of high grade neutral paraffin oil up to the cork, thus eliminating the air space. Paraffin wax plugs pressed into the vial down to the layer of the semen may also be employed, if the use of oil is not desired. The vial is then wrapped in two thicknesses of paper, covered with two rubber thumb-stalls and placed in a refrigerator or thermos flask at 3° to 8°C. This method of preservation is suitable for semen obtained from bulls, rams and goats but the more watery types of semen such as those of the horse and the boar, are more satisfactorily stored at 0° to 3°C. after separating out the glairy and viscous portion of the ejaculate and then centrifuging the sperm. Boar's sperm has been pre- served for 56 hours after separating the gelatinous lumps and mixing it with special dilutors. More elaborate precautions are necessary when semen is intended to be shipped to long distances. For this, vials containing semen are wrapped in a layer of cotton wool after which they are placed in screwcap, watertight glass-vials, which in turn are well wrapped in cotton, held in position by rubber belts. The package is then placed in a, vacuum bottle and tightly packed with chipped ice (no salt). In this way the sperm can be kept alive for 30 hours. After removing the semen from the refrigerator or the flask, its temperature should be allowed to rise very slowly by keeping it in room tem- perature for 30 minutes and then setting it in a tepid water bath at 33° to 35°C. [S.K.S.] The study and control of the vectors of rabies in South Africa. P. S. SNYMAN (1940). Onderstepoort. J. Vet. Sci. and Anim. Indust. 15, 1 and 2, 9258 ABSTRACTS Numerous other species of wild carnivora must be regarded as potential carriers of rabies. The species most commonly concerned with rabies transmission is Cynictis penicillata (Yellow mongoose). This animal has been responsible for the death of some human beings and cattle, be was causing some 80 known outbreaks of rabies. That the disease is more prevalent in this animal is not to be ascribed to any greater susceptibility to the virus of rabies, nor does the animal become any more ferocious when rabid than other species of carnivora. The reason is rather to be found in the fact that it is very abundant, living in small colonies near to one another, thus increasing the chances of contact for transmission much more than in the other animals, which are comparatively less abundant, and with a more soli- tary mode of living. As the yellow mongoose seems to play the major role and the infection discovered in other animals, until proved otherwise, may well be regarded as accidental, the campaign must be directed mainly against the former. With this species should be included the suricate and ground squirrel on account of their close association, commensal habits and on account of the damage to crops done by the last. The restraint of any kind on wild animals was out of question and total eradication of any one or all of the species concerned in the dissemination of rabies could not be contemplated. It was suggested that if at the time of an outbreak all infected animals as well as all susceptible ones, which might come in contact with them are destroyed, the disease must die out at that point as the virus cannot exist outside living animals. Should the area immediately become reoccupied by uninfected animals this would be of no consequence. The hope was expressed that by treating each successive outbreak of rabies in this fashion, the incidence of rabies would gradually be reduced. In regard to the epizootology of the disease it has been observed that rabies may smoulder in the lesser carnivora in a comparatively small area for periods up to eleven years, without being discovered. There are many instances where the disease has appeared recurrently after periods of up to eight years. Areas where a sporadic ont- break has occurred, should be regarded as suspect until it can be proved otherwise Owing to the long period of incubation in rabies, in some cases a period of six months or more, the possibility of spreading the disease by movement of domestic animals is very real and may explain why the disease may at times take unexpected long jumps. However, apart from a few cases where animals were removed during the incubation period of the disease, it has been found that the disease spreads relatively slowly to adjoining areas by means of wild carriers. From the extensive observations made it has been concluded that drought or scarcity of vegetation to some extent at least may influence the number of outbreaks of rabies recorded. This would not necessarily mean that epizootics occur during such periods The larger number of outbreaks recorded during such periods is probably due to the fact that meercats traverse larger areas searching for food, and when they become rabies they are easily seen, or the scanty vegetation allows such animals to wander further afield than when the grass is high and tall. It appears that the epizootology of rabies in South Africa is very closely associated with the habits, mode of life, migration, fo distribution, burrows and colony formation of the various wild carnivora. As a p liminary to attempting control measures, a careful study of these factors which influence the epizootics has been made and a brief description of each of the species of animals concerned with the dissemination of rabies has been given. It was obvious, that accurate knowledge of the internal structure of the colonies and burrows was required in order to devise the best methods for the destruction of vectors, e.g. fumigation, e and to determine the causes of failure to kill these animals in the warrens. A preliminary investigation was conducted near Wesselsbron, where an outbreak of rabies had occurred. It consisted chiefly of studying the formation of the colonies and the structure of the burrows of the Cynictis, Geosciurus, and Suricata. A consi- derable number of colonies, both small and large were dug up, during the course of these and subsequent experiments, and they were described and sketched to scale. To devise the most effective and yet economical method of destruction of these vectors four methods, viz. gassing the burrows with poisonous gases such as Hydrogen cyanide, Carbon monoxide, Sulphurous gases and Carbon bisulphide (a heavy gas) ; trapping; destruction of the burrows and their inhabitants by means of explosives ; and poisoning with bait. Of the various methods tried to destroy meercats, gassing
ABSTRACTS 259 of the burrows with calcium cyanide dust followed up by trapping, has proved to be the most effective. The gassing consisted of blowing finely powdered calcium cyanide dust (cyanogas) with a hand-pump into the burrows. When this dust comes into contact with air it gives off hydrogen cyanide, leaving a residue of inert calcium hydroxide and impurities contained in the powder. Imperfect working of a gassing pump; using poor quality, old or spent cyanide powder (good fresh powder should have a very fine pulverulent texture and have a bluish slate colour); gassing when the humidity, looseness and gas-absorbing properties of the soil are too high ; bad circulation of gas in the intricate tunnel maze of a colony, due to the presence of obstructions and long cul-de-sacs; closing any openings before gas has emerged from them and finally, failure to fumigate for a long enough period, i.e. until powder is seen emerging from all openings before these are closed,were found to be the likely causes which might lead to failure or ineffective work. Although rabies occurs over a large part of the Union yet it is restricted to more or less well-defined centres and localities where it seams to smoulder for long periods and thence spread slowly. Where outbreaks occur a preliminary inspection is carried out to establish the probable extent of the infection and therefore the area to be treated. This is based on the occurrence of colonies, whether there is a break in their continuity or not, the topographical features, etc. As soon as this is completed, a programme is drawn up and the whole area is divided into sections, which are to be treated in sequence. Operations are then started and carried on according to the method. The area is traversed in strips to locate the colonies, and gas them. This is followed by systematic inspection and trapping, until no meercats are left. To ensure success attention should be paid to locate all the colonies ; to comb the veld systematically to ensure that all the meercats have been chased into the burrows prior to gassing; to fumigate thoroughly260 ABSTRACTS A record of Trichinella spiralis (Owen. 1835).

RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 3 August 1942) (With one text-figure) THE problem of a better utilization of crude fibre from coarse feeding stuffs has for long been a subject of study and, some years ago, Mangold [1934] drew attention to the number of attempts made by German workers to treat straw by chemical and other methods so as to increase its digest- ibility and utilization. He mentioned the ' Lehmann process ' of alkali treatment of straw which produced a substance of greatly increased fibre digestibility. In Lehmann's process [Lehmann, 1900] 200 lb. of straw were boiled in large iron boilers with 40 gallons of water con- taining 4 to 8 lb. of caustic soda for six hours at a pressure of four to five atmospheres. After this, the product was washed with water until free from alkali and then well pressed. By this process, the digestibility of straw was found to be increased by about 50 per cent. Although the commercial utiliza- tion of this and other similar methods eventually proved to be too expensive, a large-scale production of treated straw was attempted in Germany during the last war when an acute fodder shortage was experienced. In England, Godden [1920] tried to simplify the process by soaking chopped straw over- night in a 1.5 per cent solution of caustic soda. The treated straw was then removed and the excess of caustic soda allowed to drain away, after which the material was placed in a vertical container and heated in a current of steam, the whole mass being kept at boiling point for about an hour. The substance was then allowed to cool and the condensed water drained off. During the steaming, sufficient organic acids were liberated from the straw to neutralize the absorbed alkali and consequently no further washing was required. With this treatment, Godden showed that the digestibility co- efficient of crude fibre in oat straw increased from 60.1 to 87.4 and that of nitrogen-free extract from 39.6 to 62.9. The consequent starch equivalent (S.E.) value was found to increase from 20.6 in the original straw to 36.9 in the treated straw. During the treatment, however, 20 per cent of the dry matter in the original straw was lost. When this loss was taken into account the actual increase in S. E. proved to be about 43 per cent. About the same time as this work was being carried out in England, Beckmann [1919] in Germany introduced a new technique in which no heat treatment was required. Furthermore, it was shown that an alkali solution weaker than 1.5 per cent was effective and that the time of 263 A 2
264 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws soaking could be cut down considerably without interfering with the full effect of the alkali on the straw. Other alkalies, besides caustic soda, such as sodium carbonate and lime, were successfully used in treating the straw, though in some of these cases, it was found necessary to resort to heat treat- ment. Schorger [1926] has discussed in detail the various methods of alkali treatment and the resulting chemical and nutritional changes in straw studied up to the year 1926. In the progressive agricultural areas of the world, cereal straws do not constitute a large part of the rations of livestock in normal times. Under war condition, however, when transport facilities are seriously affected and grass lands are ploughed up for human food production, a comparatively large amount of the energy requirements of farm animals can be obtained from feeding stuffs which are always at hand, such as cereal straws. At such times, any process which can enhance the nutritive value of straws is well worth our consideration. The present war has brought about a renewed interest amongst the British workers in the alkali treatment of straws. Thus Slade, Watson, and Ferguson [1939] pointed out that by soaking oat straw and wheat straw for 24 hours at ordinary temperature in 8 times its weight of 1.25 per cent caustic soda solution and subsequently washing it, a marked rise in the starch equivalent was obtained. Using a similar method recom- mended by the Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. for treating straw with 1.5 per cent caustic soda, controlled feeding work with treated wheat straw has since been carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Council at five centres in England and Wales, the detailed results of which are now available (Journal of the Ministry of Agriculture, 1941, vol. 48, p. 85). In three out of these five centres, the results obtained were definitely satisfactory. It was shown that with a total of 31 pairs of steers and heifers during an average experimental period of 71 days (half the animals being kept on treated straw and the other half on untreated straw with the same basal ration) the average gains in live weight were 0.99 lb. and 1.65 lb. per day for the untreated straw-fed and treated straw-fed groups respectively. The growth in the animals of the treated straw-fed group was thus about 65 per cent more than that in the other group. The results obtained in the other two centres were not very encouraging and the failure to obtain good results were ascribed to two reasons :K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 265 India. Next in importance comes wheat straw, which is followed by some of the millet straws. While, however, the quantitative supply of straws is vast, the quality of this feed is poor. From many feeding experiments carried out in this country, it is known that in paddy and wheat straw, the amount of digestible protein is negligible and the essential minerals are poorly provided. Moreover, though straws contain large amounts of energy-giving consti- tuents, such as crude fibre and nitrogen-free extracts, only a small propor- tion of these is actually utilized because of their poor digestibility. Thus the only nutrient, namely energy, which is available from straws cannot be supplied in an adequate quantity, because straws cannot supply more than two-thirds of the actual energy even when consumed to the maximum extent. Apart from this, it has now been shown by some workers [Carbery, Chatterjee and Talapatra, 1937] that animals fed on paddy straw are usually on a neg- ative calcium balance and that the level of calcium intake must be compar- atively high with paddy straw to produce a positive retention of this mineral. Experimental work carried out in our laboratory shows that a portion of the calcium in paddy straw is in the form of calcium oxalate, the major part of which cannot be metabolized in the body. The absorption of the rest of the calcium in the paddy straw is further hindered by the large amount of potassium which this straw contains. These factors, which are almost absent in other cereal straws, makes the position of paddy straw unique from the point of view of scientific study. Any treatment which can improve its nutritive quality and remove its inherent defects must be considered worth attempting at any time irrespective of whether it is war or peace. The object of the present article is to describe the results of an investiga- tion which has been going on for the last two years in this laboratory. Although some of the early workers determined the digestibility of treated straw, the recent work of the English investigators has been concerned with feeding trials only. Our investigation has, however, been carried out in a more comprehensive manner, so as to yield complete metabolism data regard- ing two of our most important cereal straws and interesting results have been obtained on the utilization of proteins, carbohydrates and minerals from rations containing treated wheat or paddy straw. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION I. The effect of alkali treatment on the composition of cereal straws Three kinds of straws, namely wheat, oat and paddy, were treated in the laboratory with a dilute solution of caustic soda according to the method suggested by Slade et al. [1939]. The object of the experiment was to study the following aspects of alkali treatment:266 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws The chopped material was thoroughly mixed and 170 gm. of oat and 200 gm. of wheat and paddy straws respectively were weighed out in separate en- amelled basins. To the straws, 8 times their weight of 1.25 per cent caustic soda solution was added and the contents of the basins thoroughly mixed with a flat wooden ladle. The straws were soaked in alkali for about 20 hours. The wet straw was then squeezed against the side of the basin and the alkaline liquor poured off into a separate vessel. About 45 to 50 per cent of the volume of the original liquor could thus be recovered. Tap water was then added to an amount a little over the volume lost in soaking. The ' alkaline straw ' was thoroughly turned over in this fresh water and after standing for 15 minutes, as much as possible of the wash water was separated from the straw and poured into the vessel containing the original liquor. The com- bined volume of the liquor and wash water was approximately the same as that of the alkali solution used for treating the quantity of straw weighed out. The strength of the alkali in the combined mixture of original liquor and wash water was determined. After the collection of the first wash water, the treat- ed straw was transferred to a thoroughly cleaned laboratory sink which was fitted with an overhead water tap. The outlet passage of the sink was covered with a wire gauze netting and water was continuously sprinkled over the mass of straw till the wash water was no longer alkaline. The treated straw was then dried and analysed. It may be mentioned that the dry treated straw of all three kinds was markedly changed in colour and texture, the products being distinctly yellow, softer to the feel and finer in texture than the original straws. The results and discussion (a) The alkali treatment of the straws and their subsequent washing with water to remove the alkali caused a significant loss in the dry matter TABLE I Effect of alkali treatment on the dry matter of straws Amount taken Amount obtained, after alkali treat- ment Per cent dry matter Air-dry Oven-dry Air-dry Oven-dry Recover- ed Lost (gm.)

This loss in dry matter was least in the case of paddy straw and little more in that of wheat straw. In oat straw, the loss was 34 per cent, which was consider- ably higher than in the other two types. Working with the same straw,
K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 267 Godden [1920] recorded a loss of 33.5 per cent, when the straw was treated with 1.5 per cent caustic soda solution and subsequently washed with water to free it from alkali. The loss in dry matter, as will be shown later, could be accounted for by the individual losses sustained by all the constituents except crude fibre. The two constituents which contributed most to the loss in dry matter were nitrogen-free extracts and total ash. (b) The percentage composition of straws were significantly altered after the alkali treatment. The change in the composition is shown in Table II.

Thus the percentage of crude protein, ether extract, total ash and nitrogen-free extracts was lowered and that of crude fibre increased. Crude fibre, unlike the other constituents, was apparently not affected by the alkali solution. This will be more clearly evident from the data presented in Table III, in which the recovery of the constituents has been shown on the basis of the total dry matter obtained after the treatment.

268 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws It may be observed from Table III that all the constituents suffered loss after the alkali treatment except the crude fibre. In fact, the crude fibre could be almost quantitatively recovered after the treatment. From the standpoint of nutrition, the loss sustained in crude protein and ether extract was relatively unimportant, as these constituents in straws were poorly supplied and only a little or none of these were actually digestible. The loss in nitrogen-free extracts (N.F.E.) was, however, important, as the utility of straw as a food for herbivorous animals is mainly dependent upon its crude fibre and N.F.E. contents (i.e. its moiety of total carbohydrates). The data of the present experiment, however, show that the reduction in the percentage composition of N.F.E. in the alkali-treated straw was more than compensated for by the rise in the percentage of crude fibre. In fact, the total carbohydrates per 100 lb. of dry matter were better provided in alkali-treated straw than in the original untreated straw, as will be evident from the data presented in Table IV.

Thus the percentage of potassium, phosphorus and chlorine were significantly lowered in the treated straws. The lowered percentage of these minerals, when considered along with the loss sustained in dry matter, show that during alkali treatment, considerable amounts of these minerals were washed out of the straw. On the other hand, the per- centages of calcium, magnesium and sodium were considerably increased in the treated straws. These minerals were not apparently affected by the alkali treatment. The total recovery of calcium, as shown in Table VI, moreover, suggests that, during alkali treatment of the straws, some calcium was deposited from an extraneous source. A later examination of the tap water showed that it contained significant amounts of calcium which were deposited on the straw during the course of treatment. The increase in the sodium content of treated straws was obviously due to a certain amount of the alkali having been absorbed in spite of the repeated washings. (c) Since, after one treatment, the alkali is only partially exhausted, it can be used again and thereby considerable economy can be effected. Ac- cording to Godden [1920], by bringing the strength of the residual liquor after each treatment up to its original strength, it may be made to serve for several batches of straw. He calculated roughly that, for every 100 lb. of treated straw 5 lb. of soda would be used up. In the present investigation, the strength of the alkali in the mixed solution of residual liquor and the first wash water was determined after the treatment of wheat and paddy straw. The results obtained were as follows :270 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws 2. The strength and composition of the residual liquor + first wash water after alkali treatment of wheat straw : (a) amount of NaOH . . . . . 0.09 gm. (b) amount of Na2CO3 . . . . . 17.20 gm. Total as Na2CO3 . . . . 17.32 gm. From the above results, it may be observed that there was a small amount of sodium carbonate present in the caustic soda solution originally used for the treatment but, after treatment, the major portion of the recovered alkali was present as sodium carbonate, which would indicate that the caustic soda was extensively converted into sodium carbonate on exposure during the 20 to 24 hours soaking of the straw. When the alkali content in the ori- ginal solution and the recovered liquor was calculated as sodium carbonate, it was found that after one treatment of wheat straw, 65 per cent of the alkali could be recovered. In a similar experiment with paddy straw, 63 per cent of the alkali used was recovered. In order to test how effectively the recovered alkali could be used for the next treatment, the following experiment was undertaken : To the alkali solution recovered from the treatment of paddy straw, 10 gm. of solid caustic soda were added. The added caustic soda was actually 50 per cent of the alkali present in the solution used in the first treatment. A second lot of 200 gm. of paddy straw was treated with the regenerated alkali solu- tion. At the end of the treatment the alkali was recovered in the same way as before and the recovered alkali was found to be about 66 per cent of its original strength. By similar replenishment of the recovered alkali from the second treatment, a third lot of straw was treated. The residual liquor recovered after the third treatment was found to be very thick and viscid, and, as its effectiveness was doubted, no further attempt to re-use the alkali was made. The treated straws from the second and the third batch were analysed to determine (a) the recovery of dry matter and (b) the per- centage of crude fibre. The results have been set out in Table VII along with similar figures obtained for the first lot. TABLE VII Composition of paddy straw after treatment with regenerated recovered alkali solution 1st batch 2nd batch 3rd batch Per cent recovery of dry matter . 74.8 76.0 76.5 Per cent crude fibre (on dry basis) . 46.10 45.52 45.00 It is apparent from the data given above that the quantitative change in the composition brought about in the straw by the recovered and regenerated alkali solution was practically similar to that of the first batch of straw treated with the caustic soda solution. Moreover, the composition of the crude fibre of the three lots of straw treated in the laboratory agrees well with that of the paddy straw which had been treated on a large scale and with which a feeding experiment had been actually carried out. The present
K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 271 experiment thus showed that the combined residual liquor and the first wash could be economically utilized for two more similar treatments after adjusting the strength of the alkali by adding 50 per cent of the requisite quantity of caustic soda. The above experiment, furthermore, showed that, under the same environmental conditions, a mixture of 1.5 per cent sodium carbonate solution and 1.25 per cent caustic soda in the proportion of 6 : 5, was as effec- tive for treatment as 1.25 per cent caustic soda solution used alone. Large-scale alkali treatment of straw Following exactly the same method as that described for alkali treatment of straws in the laboratory, a large-scale treatment of two kinds of straws, viz. wheat and paddy, was carried out. Eighty pounds of straw were treated every day in a round-bottomed trough made of galvanized iron sheeting with angle iron support. The trough measured approximately 5 ft. x 3 ft. x 2½ ft. At the bottom of one extremity of the trough was a small opening, which could be plugged with a rubber stopper. At the time of treatment, the end of the trough opposite to the opening was raised in order to provide a slight incline. Every day a fresh solution of alkali was prepared by dissolving approximately 4 kg. of commercial caustic soda in 64 gallons of water. A weighed quantity (80 lb.) of finely chopped straw was added to the solutions in eight lots. After each lot had been added, it was pressed into the solution to facilitate soaking. When the whole of the straw had been thus soaked, the mass was periodically turned over with iron rakes to allow uniform action by the alkali. At the end of 20 to 24 hours, the treated straw was pulled up to the raised end of the trough with a rake and the alkaline liquor allowed to trickle down to the lower end of the trough. The rubber plug fitted to the opening was removed to permit the liquor to run out. Thereafter, the plug was again inserted and half the volume of water originally used for soak- ing was added to the trough. The alkali-treated straw was thoroughly turned over in this fresh water to wash out the alkali.. As before, the mass of straw was pulled up to the raised end and the wash water allowed to run out of the trough through the hole. Two more similar washings were carried out with the same volume of fresh water. Altogether, for treating one batch of 80 lb. of straw, about 160 gallons of water were used. The treated straw after the third washing was thoroughly squeezed to remove the water and was then spread out in the sun to dry. In ordinary dry summer months, perfect drying (90 to 95 per cent dry matter) can be achieved when the straw is spread out in the sun for two consecutive days. On wet days, drying was carried out indoors by spreading the straw thinly over the floor and frequently stirring it with a rake. The treated straw dried up to 85 to 90 per cent dry matter within four to five days. During the drying process no deterioration of any kind was noticed. Altogether, 20 lots of 80 lb. of straw of both kinds, were treated. In this large-scale treatment, 76 and 72 per cent dry matter were recovered for wheat and paddy straw respectively. The composition of the treated straws are shown in Tables X to XXI. A perusal of the data will show that the composition of the large-scale treated straw compares very favourably with that of the same straws treated in the laboratory (Tables II and V). The treated straws were subsequently used for feeding trials and metabolism experiments with Sahiwal heifers.

The general improvement in digestibility was reflected in the increased digestion of organic matter from 53.3 to 69.5 per cent. The constituents of the organic matter which contributed to the improved digestibility were crude fibre and N.F.E. The digestibility of these constituents had increased from 52.2 to 75.6 per cent and 52.4 to 66.0 per cent respectively. As the crude fibre content of the concentrate quota of the ration was negligible, the increased digestibility of this constituent may be wholly accounted for by the better digestion of the fibre of the treated straw. The same argument also holds good in the case of the nitrogen-free extracts. The apparent digestibility of crude protein seemed to have been slightly depressed during the treated straw regime. With the data on digestibility thus obtained, it was possible to calculate the nutritive value of the straw, both untreated and alkali-treated, by a pro- cess of elimination. The digestibility coefficients of rape cake, as compiled by Sen [1938], show the following values : crude protein, 85 ; ether extract, 93 ; total carbohydrates, 68. When the digestible crude protein and ether extract of the rape cake were eliminated, it was found that the straw, both untreated and alkali-treated, contained either no, or an insignificant amount of, digestible protein or ether extract. The nutritive value of the straw, as such, was confined to the total carbohydrate moiety. In Table XV are set out separately the total carbohydrates digested from the whole ration, the rape cake and the straw. The digestibility coefficient of the total carbohy- drates in straw is shown in Table XVI. B

The consequent improvement in the starch equivalent value, when calculated by the Kellner's fibre method, shows that per 100 lb. of dry matter, the S.E. increases from 21.3 lb. in untreated straw to 34.1 lb. in treated straw, that is the increase in the starch equivalent of the wheat straw on alkali treatment was 60 per cent.

Moreover, the crude protein content being about 35 per cent lower in alkali- treated straw, the total nitrogen intake in period 2 was about 6 per cent lower than that in period 1. In spite of the slightly lower intake of nitrogen during alkali-treated straw feeding, the larger retention of this constituent was the outstanding feature of the balance. The balance was over ten times higher than in period 1. In period 1, out of 37.0 gm. of absorbed nitrogen, about 97 per cent was excreted in the urine. On the other hand, in period 2, out of 30.6 gm. of absorbed nitrogen, only 57 per cent was rejected in the urine. Obviously in period 2, the utilization of protein was considerably augmented. A perusal of the nitrogen balance data given by Godden [1920] reveals an identical picture, though he did not specifically discuss this point. His data show that sheep consuming 24.18 gm. nitrogen from linseed cake plus oat straw, excreted 4.9 gm. in faeces and 18.70 gm. in urine and thus retained 0.56 gm. of nitrogen. The same animals, when fed with the linseed cake and treated oat straw, out of the 23.78 gm. of nitrogen consumed, re- tained 4.30 gm. and excreted 5.58 gm. in their faeces and 13.90 gm. in their urine. Thus the retention actually increased about eight-fold. The balance of calcium and phosphorus followed the same trend as that of the nitrogen, i.e. when treated straw replaced the untreated straw, the positive balance of these minerals significantly improved. In period 1, the animals were barely in calcium equilibrium. In period 2, the high positive balance was due to a larger ingestion of calcium. This large ingestion, as has already been pointed out in the earlier part of this paper, was due to the presence of a higher percentage of this mineral in the treated straw. In period 2, not only was the balance but the percentage absorption was also definitely improved, viz. from 17 per cent in period 1 to 43 per cent in period 2. It is interesting to note also that, although the level of phosphorus intake was lower in period 2, the percentage absorption showed a definite improvement. It increased from 21 in period 1 to 29 in period 2. SECTION III.K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K.

The higher urinary excretion was true both for treated and untreated straw. The high excretion of urine during the paddy straw feeding was observed by Warth [1926], but Carbery et al. [1937] failed to notice diuresis, when paddy straw constituted the sole feed. The urination, however, was higher when the straw was supplemented with cake. In the present investigation, some interesting observations on this aspect are worth recording :K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 283 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG.1. The urinary excretion under untreated and alkali treated paddy straw feeding
284 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws straw, both untreated and treated. The treated straw in this case was pre- pared by soaking the sample of paddy straw in 0.42 per cent (not 1.25 per cent) solution of caustic soda for about 24 hours. In order to obtain a com- parative picture the animals were fed with the untreated and treated straw for the same number of days. During the latter part of each feeding trial, voidings were collected for 10 days. The daily average (for all animals) urinary volumes during these two periods and also that of the urine excreted during untreated wheat straw feeding (period 1) are represented graphically in FIG. 1. It is apparent from this that a considerable diuresis was induced during the untreated paddy straw feeding, the average excretion at that period being 6540 c.c. This diuresis, however, was markedly lessened when the same straw was fed after dilute alkali treatment. In fact, the urinary excretion dropped to almost half the volume. The lower excretion during the alkali-treated straw feeding compared very well with that observed during untreated wheat straw feeding. The anti-diuretic effect of the alkali treat- ment, however, could not be repeated with the paddy straw used in period 4 of the present investigation. The difference in the urinary excretion, during periods 3 and 4, as can be seen from the data presented in Table XIX, was not so marked. The contrary effect observed on the urinary excretion while feeding the two alkali-treated paddy straws is difficult to explain as this point was not specially studied. There is, however, one possibility. The alkali-treatment of the first lot of paddy straw was carried out with a weaker solution (viz. 0.42 per cent) than that of 1.25 per cent caustic soda, and this treatment may have been more effective in eliminating the factors responsible for diuresis.

K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 287 The results set out in Table XXV giving digestibility coefficient of the whole ration, have again shown that the treatment of a cereal straw with a solution of caustic soda markedly improves the digestibility of crude fibre and nitrogen-free extract. Compared to 62.7 per cent and 54.7 per cent digestibility of these constituents in the ration fed in period 3, the improvements brought about by the alkali treatment of the straw in period 4 were 86.1 per cent and 63.5 per cent respectively. The nutritive value of the untreated and treated straw can be calculated in the same way as in the case of wheat straw. Similar observations would also show that the nutritive value of the treated and untreated straw was solely confined to the total carbohydrate traction. In Table XXVI is shown the amount of total carbohydrate digested from the whole ration, the rape cake and the straw separately. The digestibility coefficients of the total carbohydrates in the straw has been calculated and is given in Table XXVII.

288 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws Table XXVII shows that, as a result of alkali treatment, the digestibility coefficient of total carbohydrates in paddy straw increased from 57.3 to 76.3. The starch equivalent per 100 lb. of the straw, when calculated according to Kellner's method, shows an increase from 24.4 lb. in untreated to 35.9 lb. in treated paddy straw. Thus the increase in starch equivalent of paddy straw on alkali treatment was 47 per cent. (e) Nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balances under the feeding conditions of periods 3 and 4.K. C. SEN, S.

The balance was, in fact, over four times higher. In period 3, out of 31.5 gm. of absorbed nitrogen, 86 per cent was excreted in the urine. On the other hand, in period 4, out of 28.8 gm. of absorbed nitrogen, only about 44 per cent was rejected in the urine. Thus the utilization of nitrogen was higher during the feeding with alkali-treated straws of both wheat and paddy than with the untreated straws. The balance of calcium and phosphorus followed the same trend as that of nitrogen, that is, when the alkali-treated straw replaced the untreated paddy straw, the positive balance for these minerals significantly improved. Unlike that in the experiment with wheat straw, the level of calcium intake in periods 3 and 4 was approximately the same. In fact, the intake was 1.08 gm. higher in period 3 than in period 4. In spite of this slightly higher intake during period 3, two animals barely maintained a calcium equili- brium and the other two showed a positive balance. This balance could only
290 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws be achieved when almost one-third of the calcium intake was supplied by the calcium carbonate supplement. When the animals were, however, turned on to the treated paddy straw in period 4, the calcium balance was entirely satisfactory. This satisfactory balance was mainly due to the better absorp- tion of calcium from the treated roughage. This was apparent from the fact that, out of 23.80 gm.of ingested calcium, barely 6 per cent was absorbed in period 3, whereas in period 4, out of 22.72 gm. of ingested calcium, about 16 per cent was absorbed. The marked improvement in phosphorus absorption during the treated-straw feeding regime was another remarkable feature of the mineral metabolism of the animals. Out of 13.66 gm. of ingested phosphorus in period 3, only 10 per cent was absorbed. On the other hand, in period 4, out of 11.00 gm. of ingested phosphorus, the absorption of the mineral was over 43 per cent. Experiment 2 The outstanding nitrogen balance in period 4 suggested the possibility that the animals can be kept in positive nitrogen balance with a smaller intake of cake. To test this possibility, immediately after period 4, two animals (H 45 and H 46) were put back on to a ration consisting of untreated paddy straw fed ad libitum and the usual quantity of cake. In this case, the allowance of common salt was withdrawn. The idea underlying this course of action was to deplete the excess pro- tein deposited in the body of the animals during period 4. The above feed was given for about four weeks, towards the end of which time a nitrogen balance was worked out to determine the exact nitrogen status (period 5) The results of the nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance are shown in Table XXIX.

K. TALAPATRA 291 It is apparent from the balance data presented in this table that, not only was the reserve nitrogen depleted, but the animals were also brought to negative balance. This negative nitrogen balance, as compared to the positive balance in period 3, may have been due to the withdrawal of the salt from the paddy straw ration. More data are being collected on this aspect and the subject will be dealt with in a future paper. At the end of this nitrogen balance experiment, the ration of the animals was changed to treated paddy straw fed ad libitum and a lower quantity of rape cake plus the usual allowance of 1 oz. of common salt. The animals were on this changed ration for a preliminary period of 10 days after which a 10-day collection of the usual samples was made to determine the balance for nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus (period 6). Results In Table XXX are presented the figures regarding the intake and output and the balance of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus during period 6.

It is apparent from the resulting positive nitrogen balance that the concentrate allowance can be reduced by 20 per cent or even more and yet the balance will remain significantly positive. The high calcium balance again confirms the results obtained in period 4. The data on phosphorus balance are interesting. The reduction in the intake of cake had resulted in a lower ingestion of phosphorus. In spite of this significantly low intake of phosphorus, the positive balance was maintained.
292 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws General discussion of the results of digestibility and metabolism experiments (a) The digestibility of crude fibre and nitrogen-free extracts.K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 293 straw (period 6). (b) It may profitably be utilized for production purposes, such as work, lactation and growth. In order to make adequate provision for S. E. in the production ration, it is necessary to include costly energy- rich feeding-stuffs such as grains and seeds. These feeding-stuffs also con- tain a certain amount of digestible protein. Very often this digestible pro- tein may be considered an inevitable excess in the computed ration and without specific use. As such, if energy moiety is the primary concern in the adjustment of a balanced ration, this can as well be supplied by the treated straw, which would be cheaper than the grain. (d) The digestibility of protein and nitrogen metabolism.294 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws Thus the clinical symptoms of diuresis induced under the paddy straw feed- ing has been attributed to the high potassium content of the straw. To counteract the possible ' washing out' effect of potassium on sodium and chlorine, a routine feeding of a comparatively higher dose of common salt supplement has been found necessary. The high potassium content may also be responsible, as has been found in the present investigation, for the wastage via the kidney of a significant quantity of nitrogen, which would otherwise have been retained in the body. In support of this observation the experimental evidence suppli ed by Richards, Godden and Husband [1927] can be cited. These workers have shown that excessive potassium in a ration decreases both the assimilation and retention of nitrogen. High potassium ingestion has further been proved by these workers to depress the absorption of calcium. Perhaps a part of the chronic negative balance under paddy straw feeding can be explained on this basis. The present investiga- tion definitely shows that the alkali treatment removes a large portion, practically two-thirds, of this undesirably high amount of potassium from the paddy straw. The large oxalate content is another peculiarity of paddy straw. Evi- dence has been collected in this laboratory to the effect that a major portion of this oxalate is in the form of soluble potassium oxalate but a significant fraction is present as insoluble calcium oxalate. The soluble oxalate fraction has been found to be physiologically harmless. On the other hand, a major part of the insoluble calcium oxalate passes out as such in the faeces without apparently entering into any metabolic reaction in the body. The insoluble fraction of oxalate in paddy straw thus prevents the animal from making use of a significant portion of ingested calcium. On alkali treatment of the paddy straw, a considerable portion of the total oxalate is washed out. An interesting effect of the treatment was that the percentage of insoluble calcium oxalate in the straw was considerably increased owing to the interaction of the calcium of the wash water and the soluble oxalate of the straw. As a result, the actual ingestion of calcium as unabsorbable calcium oxalate increased on an average from 4.2 gm. in period 3 to 7.4 gm. in period 4 per animal per day. Since the total intake of calcium in both the periods was the same this meant that the amount of the available calcium was apparently less in period 4 than in period 3. In spite of this, there was a better absorption and retention of this mineral during period 4. This is believed to be partly due to the removal of the excess potassium from the straw. Alkali-treated straw as a feed for horses In a recent review on the alkali treatment of straws, Williamson [1941] has drawn attention to the poor quality of hay usually available in India for feeding horses in the Remount Depots. He has raised the question as to whether an economic method such as alkali treatment could not be utilized to improve the quality of the average hay available in the country. In feed- ing a roughage to horses, cereal straws (with the possible exception of oat straw) are usually avoided because of their general coarseness and poor nutri- tive value. However, by alkali treatment, not only can the nutritive value of straws be improved but, as has been mentioned earlier, the treated straws
K. C. SEN, S. C. RAY AND S. K. TALAPATRA 295 can be made softer to the feel and finer in texture than the raw material from which they were produced. Williamson [1941] has published in a recent issue of the Journal of Agricultural Science, the effect of alkali treatment on the digestibility and feeding value of barley straw for horses. He has shown that by treating the straw in ten times its weight of 1.25 per cent solution of caustic soda for 12 hours and subsequently washing out the absorbed alkali, the digestibility coefficient of N. F. E. and crude fibre can be increased from 33.23 to 54.14 and 38.24 to 63.71 respectively. The improved digestibility resulted in the increase of S. E. from 5.53 lb. to 23.58 lb. per 100 lb. of the dry material. The feeding value of barley straw for horses is thus remark- ably improved by the alkali treatment. Furthermore, the palatability of the straw was in no way affected by the treatment because the animals ate the treated straw with ' apparent zest'. During the course of the present investigation, a small quantity of dry treated paddy straw was shown to a horse belonging to the Institute. The animal seemed to relish this feed. Further work, however, is necessary before any definite conclusion can be drawn regarding the suitability of treated straw for feeding horses in India. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The composition of wheat, oat and paddy straws can be profoundly changed by soaking them in the cold in a 1.25 per cent caustic soda solution for 20296 The Nutritive Value of Alkali-treated Cereal Straws utilization of the carbohydrate, protein and minerals from a ration in which treated straw forms the main roughage. It is also possible to meet the pro- tein requirement of the animals at a lower level of concentrate intake than that commonly prescribed. The method of treatment and the results obtained are of special interest to those areas where paddy straw forms the staple feed for cattle. In conclusion it may be stated that a separate investigation upon the economic aspect of the alkali treatment of straws is being planned.

It is made principally from buffalo milk with the addition of crude rennet and salt and is as a rule uncoloured. Panir essentially differs from all other Indian (or even imported) cheeses in that it is kept steeped in whey during its manufacture, storage, transport and distribution. This cheese is in good demand in certain parts of India as providing a concentrated nutritious food and also on account of its supposed therapeutic properties. The history of the origin of Surati cheese is obscure. In the Gujarat district of the Bombay Province it is commonly known as ' Surati panir ' and the name Suarti appears to have been derived from the town of Surat, where it was probably first manufactured. There is, however, evidence to show that it has been a commercial commodity for over half a century, as can be seen from its increasing popularity in the markets of Bombay, Surat, Poona, Dhond, Manmad and several other places. This cheese is transported over long distances by rail and road steeped in whey in large earthen chetis or matkis secured with coirs. It is difficult to estimate the quantity of fluid milk used for Surati cheese making in India as no definite information on its daily or annual output is available. But, in view of its existing popularity, it may be safely assumed that a fairly large quantity of milk is used annually. The manufacture of Surati cheese requires small equipment and little time and labour. Even small quantities of surplus milk can be profitably used by an average farmer or a dairyman instead of their being converted into other more expensive and less remunerative dairy products. Surati cheese fetches a profit of about eight annas per gallon of milk (price of milk taken at two annas per lb. and the sale price of Surati cheese at eight annas per lb). The quality is usually determined by flavour, a milder flavour fetching a premium. The method of making Surati cheese varies with the manufacturer but it is invariably empirical, thus leaving much scope for its improvement. To the knowledge of the authors this subject has not been investigated systematically in this country and it was, therefore, felt that some technical information on the manufacturing conditions suitable for the production of a high grade Surati cheese would be useful to the trade. 297
298 Studies in the Manufacture of Surati Cheese This work was, therefore, undertaken to determine the optimum conditions at every important stage of its manufacture, so that the method may be standardized even for a layman to follow.

They were then carefully turned over by hand or a flat spoon in their respective baskets and again allowed to drain for another 35 to 40 minutes for obtaining the desired uniform firmness and consistency. The collected whey was then strained through a clean muslin. The cheeses from the baskets were then carefully put into the whey and left floating till required for further observations. The cheeses were weighed at various stages for observing their progressive shrinkage and obtaining the yield data. In the course of the work the following items were studied with a view to standardizing the method of manufacture :300 Studies in the Manufacture of Surati Cheese TABLE I Effect of varying the temperature of milk at renneting and the amount of rennet used on the yield of Surati cheese Temperature of milk Amount of milk containing 6 per cent fat, used in each trial Average acidity of milk (per cent lactic acid) Average time taken for coagulation and yield of cheese 10.0 ml. of rennet per 100 lb. of milk 6.7 ml. of rennet per 100 lb. of milk 5.0 ml. of rennet per 100 lb. of milk 4.0 ml. of rennet per 100 lb. of milk Time of coagulation Yield of fresh cheese Time of coagulation Yield of fresh cheese Time of coagulation Yield of fresh cheese Time of coagulation Yield of fresh cheese °F. lb.

ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA AND H. C. VERMA 301 coagulated at 95° F. with rennet in the proportion of 6.7 ml. for 100 lb. of milk based on the findings in the preceding experiment. The results are given in Table II. The results show that the richer the milk the higher was the yield of cheese but the increase in the yield was not maintained proportionately after a certain level of fat content in milk was reached. For instance, the difference between the yield of cheese from 100 lb. each of 2 per cent and 6 per cent milks was about 16 lb., whereas the difference between 6 per cent and 10 per cent milks was only 5 lb. 6 oz., or one third of the former. It was further observed that the higher the initial fat content of milk, the higher was the loss of fat in whey. This loss was particularly high in the case of milks containing 8 per cent and 10 per cent of fat. The study of the physical characteristics of the finished cheese revealed that the cheese made from milk containing 6 per cent fat excelled all others in the matter of body, texture and flavour which are the main features on which the quality of a cheese is judged. It could, therefore, be concluded that 6 per cent fat content in milk is the most desirable one as it also gives good yield without excessive loss of fat in whey. (iii) Effect of varying the quantity of starter used.302 Studies in the Manufacture of Surati Cheese On comparing the cheeses made it was observed that acidities between 0.5 and 0.6 per cent lactic acid appeared to lend a pleasing lactic flavour and aroma and desirable body and texture to the cheese (Plate XX, fig. 2). The temperature of ripening varied between 76° and 79°F. These results also show that when Surati cheese is made with the object of keeping over longer period it is desirable to reduce the quantity of starter added in order to lower the development of acidity. (iv) Effect of varying the amount of salt.ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA AND H. C.

The yield of cheese from 100 lb. of milk is about 38 lb. The cost of produc- ing 100 lb. of finished cheese taking milk at one anna per lb. and including expenses on starter cultures, rennet, salt, baskets, etc. works out to between Rs. 19 and 20 or about three annas per lb. The yield of Surati cheese from 10 lb. of milk is nearly 4 lb. and this gives 16 loaves of about 4 oz. each. The selling of each loaf at say two annas (i.e. eight annas per lb.) thus realizes two rupees per gallon of milk. If the retail price of fluid milk is taken at two annas per lb. the gross profit accruing from the conversion of one gallon of milk into Surati cheese is twelve annas and if the milk is taken at one anna per lb. Rs. 1-6. This cheese commands a good market and, therefore, its extensive manufacture by an average farmer would prove profitable to him.
A STUDY ON DESICCATED GOAT SPLEEN VACCINE AS AN IMMUNIZING AGENT AGAINST RINDERPEST BY K. S. NAIR, G.B.V.C., M.R.C.V.S., D.T.V.M. Superintendent R. KRISHNAMURTI, G.M.V.C. AND G. S. KALYANASUNDARAM, G.M.V.C. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, Serum Institute, Madras (Received for publication on 14 October 1941) TISSUE vaccines are now widely used in combating rinderpest and several workers have employed, in different ways, rinderpest goat spleen in the preparation of such vaccines. In Burma, a dried goat spleen vaccine is being used on an extensive scale and is reported to be safe, effective and cheap. A series of experiments were conducted at the Serum Institute, Madras, with desiccated goat spleen vaccine; the product was also tried in selected areas of the province. The object of this paper is to record the results obtained. TECHNIQUE OF PREPARATION OF THE VACCINE A private communication from Mr G. Pfaff of Burma and his [1938] article ' Immunization against rinderpest, with special reference to the use of dried goat spleen' gave full details of the preparation of this vaccine. The method followed for making it was similar to that adopted by him. Briefly stated, the mode of preparation is as follows :306 A Study on Desiccated Goat Spleen Vaccine well as vaccine kept at room temperature for one to seven days was tried. The temperature of the room varied from 92.6° to 101.8°F. Further, to serve as control for the material used in the preparation of the vaccine, two buffalo-calves were each injected with 1 c.c. of one per cent emulsion, in normal saline, of the pooled spleen pulp, taken just before putting it in the desiccator. In all, 18 calves were used for this batch of experiments. The dose of the desiccated vaccine given was 0.0025 gram in 1 c.c. of normal saline, and all the calves were retested with virulent bull virus. It was found from this experiment that:K. S. NAIR, R. KRISHNAMURTI & G. S. KALYANASUNDARAM 307 The plan adopted for the experiment with the second batch of vaccine was repeated here, but the period of exposure to room temperature after removal from thermos jar was extended to seven days to determine the viability of the vaccine at room temperature, after removal from the jar. The room temperature varied from 89.2°F. to 97.9°F. Eighteen buffalo-calves were used in this experiment. From Table III, which gives details of the reactions, the following points may be noted :308 A Study on Desiccated Goat Spleen Vaccine- Emulsion kept exposed to room temperature for three and six hours A saline emulsion of the vaccine prepared immediately after removal from thermos jar and kept at room temperature for three hours and six hours, was found to be active and produced moderate reactions and conferred im- munity (Table V). Experiments with the vaccine received from Burma It was thought desirable to get a sample of desiccated goat spleen vaccine from Burma ; the Director of Veterinary Services, Madras, was good enough to get a small quantity for trial. The tubes of vaccine were received in a sealed tin container, which was placed in a thermos jar packed with ice, although at the time of opening the jar, the ice had melted during the journey of five days, and the tin was found floating in water. The trial consisted in inoculating two goats and two buffalo-calves with the vaccine as soon as it was received and again into batches of two buffalo- calves with the vaccine kept in room temperature for one to four days. The dose of the vaccine given was 0.0025 gram in 1 c.c. of normal saline solution, the emulsion being prepared just before inoculation in each case. Though the dose of the vaccine prescribed for buffaloes was only one-sixth the dose actually used in the experiment, yet inoculations were commenced with the dose advocated for cattle, viz. 0.0025 gram, as viability of the agent was alone looked for in this experiment. All the calves were tested for immunity with virulent bull virus, after the reaction to vaccination had subsided. The result of this experiment may briefly be described as follows (Table VI):- (a) The two goats that received fresh vaccine developed severe rinder- pest and died. (b) All the buffalo-calves had mild thermal reaction and at the same time acquired immunity as judged by subsequent tests. (c) There was no mortality among the calves. Experiments conducted on adult he-buffaloes with varying doses A batch of vaccine was prepared on 3 October 1939, from pooled spleen pulp of three goats of the 342nd passage of Mukteswar strain No. 1 and stored in Frigidaire. In this experiment, three sets of adult he-buffaloes (serum-makers) were selected. The first two sets, consisting of 16 and 15 animals respectively, were injected on 16 October 1939 with the vaccine that had been in the Frigidaire for 13 days; the animals of the first set received a dose of 0.0025 gram each and the buffaloes of the second set received 0.00125 gram. The third set consisting of 15 buffaloes was injected on 17 October 1939 with the same vaccine stored in the cold store for 14 days, each animal receiving a dose of 0.000625 gram. Two buffalo-calves were used as controls for this batch of vaccine and were given 0.0025 gram each, on 16 October 1939. Both developed severe rinderpest and died.
K. S. NAIR, R. KRISHNAMURTI & G. S. KALYANASUNDARAM 309 The result of this experiment can be summarized as follows (Table VII):310 A Study on Desiccated Goat Spleen Vaccine From the reports received, the following observations were made :K. S. NAIR, R. KRISHNAMURTI & G. S. KALYANASUNDARAM 311 no immunity, although in adult buffaloes, doses varying from 0.000625 gm. to 0.0025 gm. produced satisfactory reactions and conferred immunity. 7. It is suggested that the desiccated rinderpest goat spleen would produce a reaction to confer immunity. 8. In the field, in some places, the vaccine was found to have set up severe reactions and, from the experience gained, it cannot be said that the vaccine is a safe one. REFERENCES Burma, Ann. Rept. C.

Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 24 October 1941) With one text-figure) 'QUALITY ' in eggs is a term not easily defined. A good quality egg should have a normal shape and a clean, smooth, sound shell; the internal con- tents should be free from faults, e.g. ' meat spots ', ' blood spots ' and, when examined under a candling lamp, the air space should be small, the yolk central- ly placed and only dimly visible. On breaking the egg, the yolk should have a uniform colour and stand up well in the centre of a compact layer of firm al- bumen. The latter should have a good height and small area with an even outline and oval shape. The contents should show no signs of embryo develop- ment and be free from any objectionable odour or foreign matter. Most new- laid eggs are of first class quality but do not necessarily remain so for any length of time. The amount of deterioration that occurs depends on the length and conditions of storage ; high temperature, low humidity and insanitary sur- roundings all accelerate the process. All eggs, however, are not of the same high quality when new-laid and, except for major defects such as blood spots and meat spots, it is impossible to judge the quality of the albumen with any degree of accuracy by means of the candling lamp, though this is the only prac- tical method of judging quality in the unbroken egg. The edible portion of the egg consists of albumen and yolk. The former is composed of two fractions, a thick, jelly-like portion generally called the ' thick ' or' firm ' white and a thin, viscous liquid portion termed' thin ' white. Eggs containing a high proportion of thick white are generally considered to be of better quality than those with much thin white, but there is little inform- ation regarding the relative biological values of thick and thin white. Guerrant and Rudy [1939], however, found no difference in the nutritive values of these two fractions, when fed to rats. Literature A considerable volume of literature exists on various aspects of egg quality and critical reviews have been published by Wilcke [1938], Wilhelm [1939] and the Canadian Poultry Review [1940]. The quality of the white is affected by numerous factors such as the individuality of the bird, the season of pro- duction, the age of the egg and the method of storage. Holst and Almquist [1931] showed that there were wide variations in the thick white percentage 318
A. J. MACDONALD & T. S. KRISHNAN 319 of eggs from different individuals but that the quality of the eggs from the same individual remained relatively constant. These findings have been corro- borated by later workers [Lorenz, Taylor and Almquist 1934 ; Almquist and Lorenz 1935 ; Knox and Godfrey 1934, 1938 ; Van Wagenen and Hall 1936 ; Van Wagenen, Hall and Wilgus 1936 ; Winton 1937 ; Munro 1938]. The statement of Jull and Byerly [1934] that the eggs of pullets in the early stage of production have a higher percentage of thick white than those laid at a later date was refuted by Lorenz and Almquist [1936]. Lorenz, Taylor and Almquist [1934] found that the quality of the white was largely determined by inheritance, but rather limited data by Van Wagenen and Hall [1936] sug- gested that there was little relationship, as regards the percentage of thick white, between the eggs of a pullet and those of her sire's dam. Knox and Godfrey [1940] have shown that it is possible to breed two lines of fowls, one laying eggs with a high percentage of firm albumen and the other a low percent- age. Knox and Godfrey [1934] concluded that White Leghorn eggs had a significantly higher percentage of thick white than Rhode Island Red eggs but Van Wagenen, Hall and Wilgus [1937] found no appreciable differences in the firm albumen content of eggs from the common commercial breeds. Lorenz and Almquist [1936], on housing birds at temperatures of 60°F. and 85°F. and examining the eggs within 15 minutes of production, found no significant correlation between the housing temperature and the percentage of thick white. In another experiment, the birds were kept under identical con- ditions, the eggs were collected within 15 minutes of laying and were then stored overnight at temperatures of 40°F. and 86°F. respectively. As the eggs stored at the higher temperature had a lower percentage of thick albumen than those stored at a lower temperature, it was concluded that high storage tem- perature, even for relatively short periods, lowered the percentage of thick white and that the seasonal variations noticed by other workers were mainly due to variations in the storage conditions subsequent to production. Hunter, Van Wagenen and Hall [1936] and Knox and Godfrey [1938], on analysing eggs within a few hours of production, found that winter eggs had a higher percentage of thick white than those produced in summer and attributed the change to seasonal effects. Ringrose and Morgan [1939] also found a seasonal variation in quality, even though the eggs were stored overnight in a cool base- ment, but unfortunately no temperature records were kept. Wilhelm and Heiman [1938] trapnested birds 6-7 times daily and transferred the eggs as quickly as possible to an egg humidor, maintained at a temperature of 40-60°F. and a relative humidity of 78-85 per cent. The eggs were examined for quality on the day after production and it was found that there was a falling-off in the percentage of thick white from April to July but that quality improved as the weather again grew cooler. From the above brief review of the literature on the subject, it is apparent that the whole question of the quality of eggs when new laid requires further investigation. Though at first sight the literature appears somewhat in- conclusive it does show that many of the apparent discrepancies are due to the varying conditions under which the experiments were carried out. It also shows the value of working under controlled conditions and the necessity of reporting all possible data.
320 Some Factors Affecting the Internal Quality of Hen Eggs It is generally accepted in trade circles that eggs from well-bred fowls are of poorer quality than those from unselected stock. It is also widely believed in countries where poultry keeping is often highly specialized, that there has been a marked deterioration in egg quality during the last 20-30 years. Though there are no figures to support these beliefs, many people in the ' trade ' have had very long experience in, and have little to learn about, the practical estimation of egg quality. It is impossible to determine the cause or causes of this so-called deterioration in egg quality because, in recent years, western countries have revolutionized their methods of breeding, feeding, housing and managing birds for egg production. If breeding for high egg production has been responsible for a lowering of egg quality, it would appear probable that the desi fowls in this country should produce eggs of a better quality than those from imported utility, fowls, for the desi birds have never been selected for egg production, whereas the imported birds have been selected for many generations for high egg production. As eggs from desi, White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red fowls were all produced under similar conditions in the Institute flock, it was decided to test the quality of the eggs from each breed, as judged by the percentage of thick white. Further, as there was no inform- ation available in regard to factors affecting egg quality under Indian condi- tions, it was decided to investigate some of the factors concerned. Methods Twelve White Leghorn, 12 Rhode Island Red and 20 desi pullets were selected for the investigations. All the birds were hatched in February, 1939 and were kept under identical conditions from day-old onwards. The adult birds were trapnested and the eggs collected 6-7 times daily, stored at ordinary room temperature and, except when otherwise reported, they were examined for their quality on the day following production. During the period 1 March, 1940 to 31 July, 1940, 630 White Leghorn, 680 Rhode Island Red and 849 desi eggs were broken and the thick white percentage (true thick as defined by Sharp [1934]) determined, using the sieve method of Holst and Almquist [1931]. The diameter of the sieve used was 4½ inches and it had 90 holes per sq. inch, each hole having a diameter of approxi- mately 1/16 inch. The eggs were broken and the white, after separation from the yolk, was poured on to the sieve placed in a glass funnel, so that the thin fraction might run through into a measuring cylinder. The thick white sac was ruptured, the sieve gently rocked and the thin white measured two minutes later. The thick white was then poured into the measuring cylinder and the total volume read. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Individual variations Table I gives the thick white percentage of seven consecutive eggs from six birds of each breed taken at random from the daily records. The range in thick white percentage, from 34-73, gives an indication of the fluctuations that occur within a normal flock kept under standard conditions of housing, feeding and management.
A. J. MACDONALD & T. S. KRISHNAN 321 TABLE I Percentage thick white of seven consecutive eggs from typical birds of each breed322 Some Factors Affecting the Internal Quality of Hen Eggs Table II gives the monthly average percentages of thick white for typical birds from March to July. Five birds (Nos. 2, 14, 15, 4, 19) were selected as representatives of those laying eggs with a high proportion of thick white (58-68 per cent) during the first month of the experiment. Four other birds, (Nos. 21, 12, 9, 20) were representatives of those which produced eggs with a comparatively poor quality of white (48-51 per cent) during the same period. The quality of the white, as judged by actual measurement, declined in both groups from March to May. In the high quality group, the initial average figure of 62.8 per cent declined to 52 per cent in May, whilst the corresponding figures in the low quality group were 48.2 per cent and 38.2 per cent respective ly. Though the average percentage of thick white in the eggs of all the birds showed a marked decline from March to May, it is interesting to note that the decline was no greater in the eggs from the good quality birds than in those from the low quality ones and that the average thick white percentage of 52 in the good quality birds for the month of May was higher than that of the low quality birds for the month of March (48.2). The average thick white percent- age of both groups rose slightly in June but fell in July to approximately the same levels as those obtained in May. As shown in Table I, the thick white percentage is an individual charac- teristic which ordinarily tends to remain fairly constant for seven consecutive eggs but, in certain individuals, considerable fluctuations occurred even in the day to day percentage of thick white, thus making it impossible to place much reliance on an estimation of egg quality for any individual based on the exa- mination of a single egg.

A. J. MACDONALD & T. S. KRISHNAN 323 Table III gives the average percentage of thick white of all the eggs laid by six typical birds for a period of one month (April) and the averages of six consecutive eggs from each bird collected at the beginning of the month, from the 11th of the month, and the last six eggs laid during the month. In all cases, the average thick white percentage for the first six eggs laid was higher than the average for the whole month but in four of the six cases the differ- ence was only 2 per cent or less. In the other two cases, the differences of 3 . 9 per cent and 7 per cent are somewhat large and are partly due to fairly wide fluctuations in the day-to-day figures but the main cause was the large decline in egg quality among these particular birds during the month. In the case of the last six eggs laid during the month, the figures for the thick white percent- ages are somewhat lower than the corresponding figures for the whole month. The thick white percentages for six consecutive eggs laid from the 11th onward are in five of the cases within 2 per cent or less of the average for the whole month but in bird No. 1080 there was a difference of 2.7 per cent. As these figures are typical of those obtained during other months, it may be concluded that, during a period of rising temperature, the average thick white percentage of six consecutive eggs laid at the beginning of the month will be somewhat higher than that of all the eggs laid during the month and that the average for the last six eggs will be somewhat lower than the average for the month. However, the average of six consecutive eggs laid during the middle of the month is a fairly close approximation to that obtained for all the eggs laid during the month.

The monthly averages of thick white percentage and the averages for the whole period together with the temperatures and probable errors are given in Table V. In every single weekly period (Table IV), the average thick white percentage of the Rhode Island Reds is lower than that of the White Leghorns and desis for the same period. The figures obtained for the desis and the Leghorns are, however, very similar for most weeks and the monthly averages bear a very close resemblance to one another.

The similarity in the average thick white percentages found, as the result of analysing 542 and 750 individual eggs from the Leghorns and desis respectively, is of considerable interest in that it leads one to question, if it does not actually disprove, the general belief in trade circles that eggs from birds specially bred to lay, such as Leghorns, are poorer in internal quality than those from nondescript fowls such as desis. Influence of egg size In order to throw more light on the relationship between egg size and thick white percentage, a total of 1,120 eggs collected during the months of March and April were divided into three groups according to their size (Table VI). The figures show that there are very wide variations in the thick white present in each of the weight groups. The ranges of variations for each group are, however, fairly comparable and the group averages of 51, 53 and 53 per cent for the large, medium and small eggs respectively, as well as the standard deviations show that the size of egg has little influence on egg quality as judged by thick white percentage. Somewhat similar conclusions were arrived at by Knox and Godfrey [1938] and Gordon [1940]. E

Table V gives the mean monthly record of egg quality for each breed as well as the monthly average maximum temperatures. The figure shows that the thick white percentages steadily declined from 55 per cent at the commencement of March to about 42 per cent in the middle of May. During the remainder of the period the thick white percentage remained around 45, except for a temporary rise towards the end of June. The temperature curve shows that the maximum temperature rose from 80°F. at the beginning of March to 109°F. in the middle of May and after a sharp drop to 103°F., it rose again to 110°F. in the middle of June. Thereafter the maximum temperature declined and remained fairly steady around 92°F. during July. The graphs in Fig. 1 in conjunction with the data in Table V show that the rise in temperature which occurred between the beginning of March and the end of May was accompanied by a deterioration in the thick white percentage. In June, the fall in the maximum temperature was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the thick white per- centage but in July this percentage again deteriorated despite a further fall in the maximum temperature. With the exception of the figures obtained in July, for which no explanation can be offered at present, it can be concluded that there is a fairly close inverse relationship between the atmospheric tem- perature and the thick white percentage as measured in day-old eggs. As the percentage of thick white in the eggs examined might have been adversely influenced even by one day's storage under room conditions, it was decided to carry out further investigations in order to find out the percentage of thick white in new-laid eggs and the influence of storing eggs under cool conditions upon the percentage of the white. In this investigation, other birds of the Institute flock kept under standard conditions, as well as the usual ex- perimental birds, were trapnested hourly and the eggs were examined as quickly as possible after collection. A dozen eggs of each of the three breeds were examined daily for seven consecutive days, Table VII gives the figures

The table also shows the average maximum shade temperature recorded each day as well as the average thick white percentage for the eggs of the three breeds for the week commencing 1 March, 1940. The last line of the table gives the average thick white percentage of 12 new-laid eggs from each breed placed in a refrigerator on 28 May, 1940 and stored at a temperature of 55°F. for one week prior to examination.

KRISHNAN 329 The average thick white percentages of the White Leghorn, Rhode Island Red and desi eggs examined within one hour of laying were 53, 54 and 57 respective- ly for the period 19-25 May, whereas the corresponding figures for the pre- vious week (11-17 May) for day-old eggs were only 44, 38 and 44 per cent. The average thick white percentages of the White Leghorn, Rhode Island Red and desi eggs stored in the refrigerator for one week were 51, 51 and 51 respec- tively. The figures show that there is a very considerable drop in the percent- age of the thick white during hot weather when eggs are stored, even for a period of only 24 hours, at ordinary room temperature. Further, the fall in the percentage of the 'thick white recorded for eggs stored for 24 hours at an average room temperature of about 90°F. is considerably greater than that in new-laid eggs stored at a temperature of 55°F. for a period of one week. These figures demonstrate very clearly the harmful influence of high storage tem- peratures, even for a relatively short period, on the percentage of the white and the beneficial value of rapid cooling and holding of eggs at a comparatively cool temperature. As the percentage of the thick white after one week's storage at 55°F. was somewhat lower than that recorded for new-laid eggs, it appears that even this method of storage does not prevent a certain amount of deteriora- tion in the quality of eggs over a period of one week. To find out whether there is a real seasonal influence on the internal quality of eggs, the examination of hour-old eggs for their thick white percentage was repeated, exactly as described above, during different seasons, i.e. n May, September, December and early April. The results are given in Table VIII. Each figure for thick white percentage of the different breeds is the average of 84 individual determinations. The average maximum temperature in the shade during the experimental periods is also given. A study of the figures in the table reveals some interesting points. It is readily seen that the internal quality of the eggs is best in winter (December), next best in spring (April), medium only during the period of the monsoon (September) and poor in the hot weather (May). The thick white percentage of the eggs of all the three breeds increased from May to December and there- after declined. The maximum temperature in April was higher than in September and yet the quality was better in the spring than in the monsoon period. Therefore, it seems that though temperature is the chief factor governing maintenance or deterioration in quality, there are still other factors which require investigation. From these results it appears that there may be a seasonal influence on the internal quality of even new-laid eggs, those laid in winter being better than those laid in summer. Influence of fertility It is generally accepted that infertile eggs stand up to storage better than fertile eggs.. This general belief is obviously correct if fertile eggs are kept at warm temperatures, for a certain amount of embryo development takes place at a temperature of 68°F. or over. It was not known, however, whether there is any marked difference in the percentage of the thick white of fertile and infertile eggs when new-laid. In order to throw more light on this subject,

Six eggs from each of the fertile and infertile pens of each of the three breeds were collected and examined each day for a period of one week and the results obtained have been tabulated in Table IX. As the figures obtained for the infertile and fertile desi eggs were very similar and as the slightly higher figure obtained for the fertile eggs from the White Leghorns were counterbalanced by slightly better quality in the Rhode Island Red infertile eggs, it may be concluded that there is no appreciable difference in the thick white percentage of fertile and infertile new.laid eggs. On 28 May, 1940, six fertile and six infertile eggs from each of the three breeds were placed in a refrigerator within one hour of production and examined after being stored for one week at a temperature of 55°F. The results given in Table IX show that the Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn fertile eggs had a somewhat lower thick white content than the corresponding infertile eggs but as the fertile desi eggs had a somewhat better thick white content than the infertiles, it is evident that there was no appreciable difference in the rate of deterioration in fertile and infertile eggs stored at 55°F. Influence of broodiness Desi birds are characterized by persistent broodiness and under typical village conditions the birds lay only 10-15 eggs and then go broody for a period of 2-3 months. On the Institute farm also the desi birds went broody after laying 10-15 eggs but, by suitable management, the broodiness was quickly checked and the birds usually came back into production within 10-20 days. During the course of the investigation, only one White Leghorn and two Rhode

It was frequently noticed that the first egg laid of a new clutch had a considerably higher thick white content than the last egg of the preceding clutch. Table X gives the complete data in regard to the thick white content of the last egg before each case of broodiness and the sub- sequent first egg of the next clutch. Of the 56 cases of broodiness recorded, 41 (73.2 per cent) showed an increase ranging from 1.4 to 23.6 in the thick white percentage in the first egg laid after broodiness over the last egg laid in the preceding clutch. In five cases representing 8.9 per cent, there was little or no change in quality and in 10 instances, representing 17.9 per cent of the total, there was a decrease in the firm albumen percentage ranging from 1 . 3 to 10.9. The thick white percentages of all the last eggs before broodiness and the first eggs after broodiness were 48.9 and 55.0 respectively. Allowing for the day-to-day variations which occur in the internal quality of the white, the figures as a whole show clearly that the first egg after broodiness is signi- ficantly superior in quality to the last egg of the previous clutch.

ABSTRACTS Studies with equine streptococci. 2. Experimental immunity to Str. equi. P. L. BAZEBLEY, (1940). Aust. Vet. J. 16, 243 THE author has explored the conditions under which a potent vaccine can be produced having protective action against experimental Str. equi infection in mice. The medium employed for the preparation of the vaccine was a nutrient broth made from veal extract with one per cent proteose peptone and half per cent sodium chloride to which 10 per cent horse serum and half per cent glucose were added. The final pH. of the medium was 7.2 to 7.4. A fourteen to eighteen hour growth of Str. equi in this medium was transferred to a similar medium previously conditioned at 37°C., the inoculum being 10 per cent of the total bulk. After the stipulated period of growth the organisms were centrifuged down through an angle centrifuge or other high speed centrifuge and resuspended in Wright's fluid (0.1 per cent gelatine solution with a phosphate buffer of pH. 7.6). This suspension was sterilized by heating at a temperature of 56°C. as early as possible after suspension was effected. The author's experiments include trials to determine the age at which the culture has to be reaped for the realization of a potent vaccine and to ascertain the conditions which govern heat-killing of the culture for the immuno-antigen to remain unimpaired. Mice were used as the test animal and the results were evaluated by the application of statistical methods. The results may be summarized as follows :336 ABSTRACTS In the first experiment which was of a preliminary nature, four pairs of calves were used, the animals being fed morning and evening. Two pairs received 14 daily doses of ordinary raw milk, which constantly contained small numbers of tubercle bacilli sufficient to infect guinea-pigs, though not usually demonstrable in smears of centrifuged deposit. The other calves received three doses of half-a-pint of heavily contaminated milk ob- tained by mixing several samples from cows with tuberculous mastitis. This milk infected guinea-pigs in a dilution of 1 : 100,000 and tubercle bacilli were readily demonstrable in smears of the deposit. It was diluted 1 : 4 with pasteurized milk before being fed to the calves, whilst the ordinary raw milk was fed undiluted. In each group of 4 animals one pair drank the contaminated milk out of an ordinary bucket, while the other pair was given it by stomach tube passed into the rumen. Dur- ing withdrawal of the tube pasteurized milk was run through so as to minimize-the risk of carrying infected milk into the throat. The total amount of slightly contaminated milk given to each calf was about 30 pints, while the amount of the highly contaminated milk received by each of the four calves was 1½ pints. It is calculated that the total number of bacilli given to the two series of calves were in a ratio of about 1 : 5,000. Of the four calves given ordinary raw milk two failed to develop tuberculosis, viz. one which received the contaminated milk by tube and the other by bucket. The other two showed at autopsy primary lung tuberculosis of the aspiration type with caseous bronchial nodes and involvement of the anterior mediastinal nodes. One of these had regurgitated and aspirated some of the contaminated milk and recovered only after several days' severe respiratory distress. Of the four given highly contaminated milk, one was killed in extremis 27 days after the last feed and on autopsy showed an acute focal interstitial nephritis and no tuber- culosis. Of the other three, which all proved infected, one showed primary tuberculosis of the tonsil and intestine, the second primary tuberculosis of the .ung and bronchial node with a second primary lesion in the right suprapharyngeal node, while the third which had regurgitated showed primary tuberculosis of the lung and bronchial node besides a calcified lesion in a mesenteric node. The tonsil and suprapharyngeal node of this animal were positive on guinea-pig inoculation. Further experiments were carried out in which an attempt was made to introduce a culture of bovine tubercle bacilli about 4 weeks old directly into the duodenum under general anaesthesia. The anaesthetic first tried was nembutal intravenously but this proved unsatisfactory and two calves were lost. Later pentothal sodium was substituted and this proved satisfactory, as it gave a period of anaesthesia lasting some 20 minutes, which was long enough for such operational interference as was required. In the first trials the culture was injected into the duodenum by means of a syringe, but as this resulted in the formation of a tuberculous nodule in the wall of the duodenum, in later ex- periments the culture was enclosed in a gelatin capsule, which was sealed by immersing in collodion. The capsule was introduced into the duodenum by means of an ejector inserted into it through an incision made in the abdominal wall. Two calves were given in this way 0.01 and 1.0 mg. of culture respectively. The first showed no lesions of tubercu- losis when killed 36 days later, while the second which was killed 17 days after operation showed at autopsy tuberculosis of the abomasal wound and of the regional lymph node, the capsule having come apart in the abomasum during insertion. Histological examina- tion showed small foci of epithelioid cells in the hepatic and 2 mesenteric lymph nodes. A series of 6 calves was then given varying doses of tubercle bacilli in double gelatin capsules, a small capsule containing the culture being enclosed immediately within a larger capsule and the latter sealed by dipping several times in collodion. Two calves received 1.0 mg. of culture. One of these died 36 hours after the opera- tion from an acute streptococcal infection. The other killed 58 days after the operation showed extensive tuberculosis of Peyer's patches throughout the small intestine. Lesions were also present in the mediastinal, hepatic and bronchial nodes and there was generali- zation involving the lungs and spleen. In this calf the abomasal wound also showed tuber- culous foci, the gelatin capsule having come apart during insertion. Two calves received 10.0 mg., but in both these animals the capsule had probably been accidentally liberated from the ejector in the abomasum. One was killed 36 days after operation and at autopsy showed lesions in all the mesenteric nodes and Peyer's patches. The other was found dead 14 days after operation. There was no microscopic
ABSTRACTS 337 evidence of tuberculosis, although the granulation tissue at the operation site in the abo- masum showed numerous acid-fast bacilli and a few lesions of productive type were found in the mediastinal lymph node. Two calves were given 80.0 mg. of culture. One was killed 23 days after the opera- tion and showed caseous Peyer's patches and mesenteric nodes and the mediastinal and hepatic lymph nodes were positive for tuberculosis on guinea-pig inoculation. The other calf was killed after 54 days and showed tuberculous lesions in Peyer's patches and the mesenteric nodes. Other nodes were normal. In view of the common use of the teat bucket in commercial calf-rearing three calves were given 1.0, 0.01 and 0.0001 mg. of culture in a pint of milk by this method. They were killed after 23, 59 and 58 days respectively. The first two showed lesions only limited to the intestinal tract and the mesenteric nodes. The third showed no tuber- culosis of the intestinal tract, but the right bronchial node was caseous and epithelioid cell foci were present in the mediastinal node. The lungs were free from tuberculosis. Three calves received 0.1, 0.01 and 0.0001 mg. of a culture in 1.0 c.c. saline intra- tracheally, the inoculation being made in the mid-ventral line in the lower third of the neck. The first was killed after 24 days, while the other -two died 41 and 31 days after inoculation respectively. Post-mortem examination revealed a local lesion in the trachea in the first two calves and tuberculosis of the middle cervical node in all the three. On histological examination and guinea-pig inoculation evidence of tuberculosis was found in the bronchial, mediastinal and pharyngeal nodes of the first calf, and in the mediastinal and bronchial nodes of the second, while all these nodes were negative in the case of the third. The authors discussing their results review in detail the literature on tuberculosis in bovines published since 1910 and come to the conclusion that their own results as well as those of other workers lend no support to Calmette's view that tubercle bacilli can pass through the intestine, remain latent in the mesenteric nodes, and then produce lung lesions without leaving any sign of passage through the mesenteric nodes. On the con- trary, they prove that when infected material is given by the mouth, the throat and lungs are most readily infected, while the intestines and mesenteric nodes are involved only with large doses or not at all, due in part to the bactericidal effect of the stomach con- tents. Primary infection of the lungs in such cases is due to., inhalation or aspiration of the contaminated material. Attempts to set up infection of the lungs by the intratracheal inoculation of culture were unsuccessful, an experience in accord with that of other workers. The use of a spray through a tracheotomy wound is a more effective way of setting up primary lung tuberculosis, as this ensures the passage of the bacilli directly into the alveoli. [L. S.].

Dairy Res. 10, 165-85 IN the present study are included the following investigations : (1) the effect of high temperature treatment in the nutritive value of protein of young spring grass for milk production, (2) the comparative biological value of proteins in dried autumn and spring grasses for milk production, (3) the supplementary effect of the proteins in the mainte- nance ration on that of production ration, (4) the effect of feeding high protein ration on milk production. Studies on systematic nitrogen metabolism were also made through- out the whole investigation in each case. The investigations under head 1 and 2 were conducted on six Ayrshire cows, each ani- mal having calved four to six weeks back. The weights of the animals varied from 950 to 1,100 lb. Throughout the experiment each cow received a maintenance ration of straw, oats and beet pulp at the rate of 6 lb. S. E. (Starch equivalent) and 0.6 lb. P. E. (Protein equivalent) per 1,000 lb. live weight. The production ration was fed at the rate of 2.5 lb. of S. E. and 0.44 lb. P. E. per 10 lb. of milk. The concentrates under investigation, were given in the production ration in quantities, which supplied equiva- lent amounts of nitrogen to the ration, the rations being balanced with oats and maize. To obtain the high-temperature dried grass, the drying temperature was increased from 300°C. (the normal drying temperature) to 350°C. The results show that high- temperature dried spring grass caused no fall in milk yield in comparison with low-tem- perature dried spring grass. On the other hand, the grass cut in autumn, appeared to reduce the milk yield. The nitrogen excretions in milk and urine led to a relatively high wastage of nitrogen via urine when dried autumn grass was fed. A study of nitrogen metabolism showed that high-temperature drying had no effect, whereas marked effects were noticed with the autumn grass. The hippuric acid nitrogen output decreased with high-temperature dried grass possibly due to the loss on drying of benzoic acid. It also appeared that the high-temperature treatment had in some way affected the nature of sulphur compounds in the grass, with a consequent diminution in the retention. The investigations under heads 3 and 4 were conducted on three Ayrshire cows, each having a calf of four to six weeks. The weight of the cows varied from 930 lb. to 1,050 lb. To study the supplementary effect of the maintenance protein on production protein, the roughage was varied by using either hay or straw. While the nitrogen supply remained the same, the amino-acid make up, especially the lysine content, was higher in the ' hay ration ' than in the ' straw ration '. The production protein intake in both cases was of poor biological value. In order to feed excess protein, the production protein intake was increased from 0.44 lb. P. E. per 10 lb. of milk, to 0.60 lb. P. E. The results show that when ' straw protein ' replaced ' hay protein ' the milk yield was below the expected level. With an excess of protein in the ration, most of the excess nitrogen was eliminated in the urine, and both the milk yield and the biological value of the food protein fell considerably. Furthermore, the results of the high protein diet confirmed those obtained in the previous experiments carried out by the authors, in which a poor quality of protein fed at the end of lactation and the addition of more than sufficient lysine did not maintain the milk production at the normal level. This failure was not due to any inadequacy of the quantities of essential amino-acids of food protein for milk production, but to the lack of definite proportions of these amino-acids for better utiliza- tion. Nitrogen metabolism in high protein dietary showed an increased excretion of ereatinine, though no extra creatinine was fed in the food. The purine metabolism varied with the total nitrogen excretion, the allantoin increasing markedly in the high protein period. [S. C. R.]
ABSTRACTS 339 Causes of deaths among calves in dairy herds. R. LOVELL (1939). Vet. Record 51, 1081 IN this article the common causes of calf mortality have been reviewed. Colibacillosis salmonellosis, corynebacterium pyogenes infection, pneumonia due to haemolytic cocco-bacillus, pasteurellosis, helminthiasis, calf-diphtheria, coccidiosis and hydrocyanic poisoning are dealt with. Several observations are quoted to support the view that colibacillosis is the result of the shifting of an equilibrium in favour of Bact. coli which are normally present in the digestive tract. This shift may be governed by a combination of factors such as defects in the digestive tract, a delay in feeding leading to over distention and the formation of undigested coagulable protein in the stomach, the withholding of colostrum or the pre- sence of a particularly virulent strain of Bact. coli. As the strains of Bact. coli vary from herd to herd, it appears useless to consider any form of mass immunization. The other way to avert the disease, is to avoid the predisposing causes by paying attention to the improved methods of calf rearing. Salmonella infection in calves is largely due to S. enteritidis var. dublin. Affected calves suffer from offensive diarrhoea, and may contract pneumonia or septicaemia. The disease is of some importance in relation to public health, as the organism has been known to cause food poisoning in man. Another Salmonella sometimes associated with calf diseases is S. typhimurium. G. pyogenes infection is regarded as endogenous in its development. Attacked calves suffer from pleurisy and suppurative pneumonia. It is suggested that the control of this disease may be attempted by immunization with toxoid. The infections due to haemolytic cocco-bacilli usually follow the introduction into the herd of a carrier and calves become predisposed to this infection while in transport through rail or road. The weather also has its influence, as more cases of infection occur during the winter months. When attacked, calves suffer from pneumonia or rhinitis. It is admitted that occasional cases of pneumonia may be due to invasion by true Pasteurel- la septica. Several helminthic parasites causing disease in calves are mentioned.. Trichostrongy- lus sp. is one. Ostertagia ostertagi causes anaemia, general weakness and death, under- fed and young animals being particularly susceptible. Cooperia oncophora infection causes a marked anaemia and is often acquired on moist pastures. Haemonchus contortus leads to constipation, diarrhoea, anaemia and death. Dictyocaulus viviparus causes ' Husk ' or ' Hoose ' in affected animals. The characteristic cough and dyspnoea are observed. Hydrocyanic acid poisoning acquired by the intake of linseed cake macerated with warm water, calf diphtheria caused by Fusiformis necrophorus and characterized by necrotic changes in the mouth and pharynx, and ' winter dysentry ' or ' black scours ' caused by Vibrio jejuni have been mentioned. Coccidosis is also responsible for disease in calves. [V. R. R.] On the toxicity of nicotine for sheep and the use of the nicotine-bluestone drench for worms in ruminants. H. O. MONNIG (1937). Rev. Med. Trop. Parasit. 3, 3-10 MIXTURES of nicotine and copper sulphate were first used in the United States for the treatment of tapeworms in lambs. Some years ago, Monnig devised careful experiments to ascertain the toxicity of nicotine for sheep, and the use of nicotine-blue- stone drench for worms in cattle and sheep. As a result of these experiments, it was found that there was a marked difference in the susceptibility of sheep to nicotine, some sheep showing more susceptibility than others. A dose of 40 per cent nicotine over 1.5 c.c. was not safe in all cases, although some sheep could tolerate 5 c.c. A safe dose of copper sulphate should not exceed 2 gm. The administration of nicotine sulphate alone causes toxicity, incoordination, laboured breathing, degeneration of liver and kidney, haomorrhagic gastro-enteritis and death in some cases. The addition of copper sulphate
340 ABSTRACTS to nicotine decreases its toxicity. Further, it induces the closure of the oesophageal groove, so that the mixture passes directly into the abomasum. As a result of several trials the following mixture was found to be very effective : 40 per cent nicotine sulphate 1 oz., copper sulphate 1 oz., and water 3 pints. The dose for lambs one to three months old was 3/4 oz., for lambs three to six months 1 oz., for those six to twelve months 1 1/2 oz. and for sheep over one year 2 oz. For cattle under two years of age, 1 oz. of the nicotine per 50 lb. of live body weight with a maximum dose of 3 oz. was effective. This mixture was found to have potent anthelmentic action against Moniezia, Tri- chostrongylus, Haemonchus, Cooperia, Ostertagia and Oesophagostomum infections. In the case of cattle the administration of the mixture should be followed by a dose of castor oil. [G. D. B.] Methods of improving interior egg quality. L. A. WILHELM (1940). Poul Sci. 19, 3-8 THE object of the investigation was to study the effects of temperature on fresh eggs packed in different ways. S. C. White Leghorn pullets were classified as to their albumen index, by finding out the mean albumen index of a number of consecutive eggs from each bird. The albumen index loss due to treatment, determined by measuring the albumen indices at the beginning and end of the treatment, calculated on a percent- age basis, was employed for estimating the loss of internal egg quality. Five different methods of storing eggs were used for comparison. Eggs of known albumen index used for each treatment were stored in standard 2 by 6 egg cartons and served as controls. The other four treatments, all of which were stored in air-tight containers, were : sealed in air-tight container under atmospheric conditions ; sealed in air-tight container, after the air had been displaced by carbon-di-oxide ; sealed in air-tight container, under vacuum ; and sealed in air-tight container after the vacuum had been released with carbon dioxide. The containers were stored at temperatures of 30, 50, 70 and 90° F. for periods ranging from one to fifty-six days. The results of this investigation indicate :ABSTRACTS 341 over an extended period and still deliver a satisfactory ejaculate, especially if the semen is to be used artificially. If more ejaculates are obtained., the bull's fertility is lowered. Stored semen when used 24 or more hours after collection compared favourably in ferti- lity with average fresh semen samples. Cows bred early in heat and late in heat are less likely to conceive than those bred 18 to 24 hours after the onset of external symptoms of heat. Virgin heifers conceived more readily than mature cows due to low incidence of disease in virgins. Cows with normal genital tracts conceived much more readily than cows affected with disease of genital tracts. Certain problems in technique and variation in semen samples are discussed such as preparation of a new semen collector for use, methods of cleaning it, the temperature of the collector when used, care to be taken to protect the semen against sudden temperature changes, methods of transporting semen, dilutors and the quality, colour and consistence of semen. [P. R. K.] Inheritance of broodiness in Rhode Island Reds. F. A. HAYS (1940). Massachusets Agri. Exp. Bull. 377, 1-11 BREEDING tests on the inheritance of broodiness in Rhode Island Reds were carried out over a period of 10 years with 1767 females bred from 72 males and 210 females. The results show that the inheritance of broodiness in a stock can be measured fairly accurately by measuring the number of broody periods in the first laying year. Of the daughters of dams which had only one broody period in their first laying year 72 per cent were non-broody, 10 per cent were broody once, 7 per cent were roody twice and 11 per cent were broody three or more times. In another group of dams which went broody twice only 28.3 per cent of the daughters were non-broody and more than 39 per cent had three or more broody periods. In the case of dams which showed no broodiness during their first year 89.3 per cent of the daughters were non-broody, 7.1 per cent went broody on one occasion and 2 .2 per cent went broody twice and 1.3 per cent were broody three or more times. In dams which showed no broodiness over a period of two years 92.8 per cent of the daughters were non-broody and the majority of the others went broody only on one occasion. The record of broodiness from daughters of dams that were free from broodiness over a period of three years was very similar to that of daughters bred from dams which were non-broody for a period of two years. From an analysis of the results obtained it is concluded that broodiness depends upon the inheritance of two complementary dominant genes, A and C, neither of which is sex-linked. [A. J. M.] The effect of ration deficient in phosphorus and protein on ovulation, oestrus and reproduction of dairy heifers. L. S. PALMER, T. W. GULLICKSON, W. L. BOYD, C. P. FITCH and J. W. NELSON (1941). J. Dairy Sci. 24,199 IN order to study the effect of rations low in phosphorus and protein on ovulation, oestrus cycles and sexual activity, the authors undertook an experimental study in 1933. Observations were made on eleven grade Holstein animals over a period of 24 to 59 months. These animals were fed on rations consisting of prairie hay obtained from a phosphorus-deficient farm. In addition, a small amount of grain mixture was also given. The average amount of phosphorus in hay was 0 .066 per cent and of crude protein 5.31 per cent. Except for brief periods, or during lactation in the latter phases of the study, the animals consumed 5 to 8 gm. phosphorus and 0.4 to 0.75 pound digestible crude protein daily, depending on their age and their appetite for the hay. The digestible crude protein comprised between 5 and 10 per cent of the total digestible nutrients. Frequent observations were made for evidences of pica, physical condition and general behaviour and it was found not only that most of the animals grew at a subnormal rate, but they developed the course, unthrifty appearance, disproportionately large heads, F
342 ABSTRACTS coarse coat, and emaciated condition characteristic of the heifers and cows fed largely on prairie hay in the phosphorus-deficient regions of Minnesota. The authors concluded that a combined deficiency of phosphorus and protein in the bovine delays sexual maturity, suppresses normal evidence of oestrum so that periods of oestrum appear to be missed, but does not interfere with normal regularity of ovulation or the ease of conception. No reduction, however, in breeding efficiency was observed. The ease with which these undersized, miserable-appearing specimens of the bovine species conceived, when bred long after the normal age of first breeding, and the normal vigour of calves produced were definitely contrary to expectations. However, the marked dystocia (mainly maternal) which occurred in four of the eight animals employed for the breeding study must be regarded as probably due in large measure to the dietary deficiencies im- posed. [N. D. K.] Combined (miscellaneous) immunisation against tetanus L. OTTEN and I. P. H. HENNEMANN (1939). J. Path. & Bact. 49, 1 THE authors in a series of 8 experiments on guinea pigs confirmed the findings as obtain- ed in immunization against diphtheria by other workers, that the active immunity against tetanus by formoltoxoid appears to be inhibited by the presence of a passive immunity. They attributed this inhibitory action to the antitoxin itself whether of heterologous or homologous origin. The results obtained in experimental guinea pigs showed that the critical period was from 3rd to 6th week when passive immunity became exhausted and active immunity has not reached the required level. They concluded from their experimental work that the gap between the exhaustion of passive immunity and the acquisition of active immunity to the required level, could be bridged by giving 3 injections of formoltoxoid at 10 days interval, the first two followed by injections of serum after 24 hours. In this manner the passive immunity passed into active one without any interruption. [W. M. K.] Rinderpest in buffaloesABSTRACTS 343 In the fourth experiment the author claims to have obtained support for his concep- tion that long drawn out and severe reactions in the field may be due to a superimposed natural infection contracted soon after vaccination. Eight buffaloes were vaccinated with different doses of the dried goat spleen vaccine. Three days later they were injected with a lethal dose of virulent cattle virus. The temperature of these animals persisted up to the 18th day (compared to 10 to 12 days in the simple vaccinated animals) and they lost also very much more in condition. These experiments seem to demonstrate that the vaccine may be safely used for Burmese buffaloes in good condition, provided they are well cared for and given at least 30 days'rest after inoculation. Some loss in condition may be expected. The quanti- ty of vaccine given does not appear to affect the reaction, but it is possible that a very severe and long drawn out reaction may be due to infection soon after inoculation. Surra may be a complicating factor in the inoculation of buffaloes. [V. R. R.] (a) An effective treatment for the control of the sheep head grub, Oestrus ovis, in areas where the winters are cold. N. G. COBBETT (1940). J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc. 97, 565 (b) A method of large-scale treatment of sheep for the destruction of head grubs (Oestrus ovis). N. G. COBBETT (1940). J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc. 97, 571 (a)THE infestation of sheep with the larvæ of Oestrus ovis, though not responsible for considerable death rate amongst these animals, undoubtedly tells heavily on their general health. In areas where the winters are too cold for the sheep bot flies to survive, the first-stage larvæ winter over in the nasal passages of sheep. These minute grubs remain in a quiescent state of development on the nasal mucous membranes throughout the winter months and migrate to the frontal sinuses for further development in early spring. The author reports that application of one fluid ounce of a 3 per cent solution of saponified cresol (lysol) in the nasal passages of infected sheep during the winter months, kills these larvæ. Recovery was obtained in 90 per cent of the cases with one; such course of treat- ment and in 98 per cent when the treatment was repeated after an interval of 5 days. This treatment causes temporary irritation of the mucous membrane, giving rise to spas- modic coughing and sneezing and a flow of mucus from the nostrils. No injury resulted when the treatment was administered quickly and the treated animals released promptly. The method of applying the treatment is to force the fluid into the nasal passages by 35 to 45 pounds of air pressure. The head of the animal being held on the dorsal surface with the muzzle slightly elevated. (b) Approximately 90,000 New Mexico range sheep in 45 flocks were treated for head grub infestation during 1936-39 by the method described in the procceding article and the method proved practicable and satisfactory to the sheep owners. The treatment was applied principally during the months of November and December. To facilitate the treatment of large numbers of sheep, the author devised a restraint table consisting of a tilting V-shaped restraint trough and its supporting stand ; and an air pressure treating apparatus consisting of a solution tank, auxiliary tank, lead-off and a nozzle for injecting the solution into the nostrils of sheep. With sufficient help available to insure the con- tinuous operation of two restraint tables it was possible to treat as many as 700 sheep in one hour. The animal is restrained and handled in the manner in the preceeding article and the point of nozzle is inserted one to two inches first into one nostril and then the other in a downward and outward direction so that the stream of solution is directed towards the interior surface of the lateral wall of each nasal passage. [B. C. B.] Production of heat and ovulation in the anestrous ewe. BELL, CASIDA BOHSTEDT AND DABLOW (1941). J. Agri. Res. 62, 10, 619 THE article reports attempts to produce oestrus and ovulation in the ewe during sea- sons when it is usually anestrous, during the spring and early summer months. Injections of endocrine substances were used. A study of the vaginal smears of the experimental ewes is also included as oestrus may sometimes occur without ovulation.
344 ABSTRACTS Thirty yearling ewes with an average body weight of 85 pounds were used. Alfalfa hay only was fed ad libitum throughout the study ; during this time they were kept inside a barn, except for brief exercise periods in a dry lot. Daily vaginal smears were taken, by use of a glass speculum and a glass rod, within 1 to 2 inches from the cervix. The mucus was noted and recorded as ' thin, thick, or cheesy '; no mucus was recorded as ' clear '. Examination of the mucus was made microscopically with eosin under the low power objective. Large, round, nucleated epithelial cells, cornified epithelial cells and leucocytes were estimated and evaluated as none, very few, few, several, many or very many. A few ewes, usually four, were injected at a time during May, June and July. All ewes were tested daily for oestrus by an aproned male. Untreated ewes served as control animals in each case. Finally the ewes were spayed in order to check the ovarian res- ponse to the treatment. Progynon-B, the benzoic acid ester of dihydrofollicular hormone, was injected subcutaneously in the shoulder region. Pregnant mare serum, prepared by acetone precipitation and desiccation and assayed with rats, was injected subcutaneously as an aqueous solution into the shoulder and flank regions. Sheep anterior pituitary extract prepared from acetone-desiccated powder by a triple water extraction followed by pre- cipitation and then drying with acetone after centrifugation, and assayed with rats, was injected either subcutaneously or intravenously. Pregnant mare serum, in single 100 rat unit subcutaneous injections, produced ovulation in seven out of eight anoestral ewes, but without apparent signs of oestrus. Of four ewes receiving pregnant mare serum and Progynon-B simultaneously, two ovulated with no signs of heat; one of the two not ovulating showed signs of oestrus. Three of the four ewes receiving pregnant mare serum followed by Progynon-B ovulated ; the fourth neither ovulated nor showed signs of oestrus. Eight ewes received Progynon-B alone ;five of them came into heat. Four ewes receiving sheep anterior pituitary extract all ovulated with no apparent signs of oestrus ; this was also true of one ewe receiving pregnant mare serum and sheep anterior pituitary extract and one ewe receiving pregnant mare serum, sheep anterior pituitary extract and Progynon-B. Doses were 2.5 grams of pregnant mare serum in single subcutaneous injections and 2 .5 gram-equivalents of the sheep anterior pituitary extract in four daily sub- cutaneous injections of 0.5 gram-equivalent each followed by an intravenous injection of the same amount. Progynon-B doses were 1000 or 2000 rat units. Assays showed that the dose of pregnant mare serum contained approximately twice as many rat units as that of anterior pituitary extract. In spite of this, however, the ovulation rate was greater in ewes which received the pituitary extract. The authors suggest that the method of injection and/or a greater response per rat unit of pituitary extract may explain this difference. Oestrus was not regularly produced with either small or large doses of Progynon-B, neither did the study show which dose was more successful. No significant difference occurred in the vaginal smears during ovulation with induced oestrus from those in ewes with induced oestrus without ovulation. [J. N. W.] A genetic history of Hampshire sheep. R. C. CARTER (1940). J. Hered. 31, 2, 89 THE Hampshire breed of sheep originated in the counties of Wilts, Hants, and Berks in southern England, where the Wiltshire Horned and Berkshire Knot breeds were found in 1830. Mr. Wm. Humphries, it is reported, used two Southdown rams to linebreed within his flock which was closed to outside blood. He fixed a type which proved to be the foundation of the Hampshire breed. The Hampshire Down Sheep Breeding Association, in England, was organized in 1889, issuing its first flock book in the following year. Rams were registered individually, the ewes by the flock. Since 1908 eligibility for registration has been limited to animals whose sire and dam are both registered. Importation into the United States, starting in 1855, brought about the establish- ment of the American Hampshire Down Sheep Breeding Association in the same year as the English organization. Rams and ewes were registered individually; only those
ABSTRACTS 345 whose ancestry could be traced directly to established English flocks were eligible. The American association started with only 739 sheep but now registers nearly 20,000 annually. Two samples of the breed, born in 1925 and 1935 respectively, of 400 animals each, 200 of each sex, were selected for study. Two factors limited the trend of the study : the recent importation of some foundation stock of these samples and the individual registration of only the rams in the English flock books. The average inbreeding and inter se relationship coefficients were determined. These showed that ' about 1.4 per cent of the heterozygosis which was present in 1911 had been lost by 1925. Similarly those born in 1935 had lost about 2.9 per cent of the heterozygosis that was present in 1914.' Animals of a particular breed, by reason of their common ancestry, are all related to each other. Inbreeding results to some extent, therefore, although mating may be truly at random within that breed. The author states that, ' Under such circumstances the inbreeding (F) expected purely because of the average inter se re- lationship (R) would be F=R/2-R.' The extent of inbreeding found did not explain the inter se relationships of zero in 1925 and 0.5 per cent in 1935. This was probably a result of separation into families resulting from geographic separation. The method of pedigree sampling used made it possible to determine the importance of various ancestors. Only two animals, both rams, were related to the whole breed as much as two per cent. Blendworth Herriad, No. 45215, was imported from England. He was related to the breed to the extent of 2.4 per cent in 1935. This ram's son, No. C-1659, had a relationship of 3.0 per cent in the same year. The generation interval was found to be 3.8 years and 3.5 years respectively for the 1935 and 1925 samples. Dickson and Lush had reported 4.2 years for the Ram- bouillet breed. The author suggests that the greater this interval the greater the numeri- cal equilibrium of the breed. [J. N. W.] Storage of dairy bull spermatozoa. E. W. SWANSON and H. A. HERMAN (1941). J. Dairy Sci. 24, 7,579 THE utility of stored or shipped bull semen depends upon the extent to which the origi- nal fertility of the spermatozoa is retained. The different storage temperatures and diluents have not provided a solution for all difficulties. The fertility of stored bull semen has been found to be correlated with the time of survival with vigorous motility of the spermatozoa. Temperatures of 35° to 40°F. have proved to be the best for storage if the fresh semen is reduced to such temperatures slowly. The results arising from the use of diluents have been variable ; most of them increase the volume and may stimulate motility. The removal of the sperm fluid and concentration of the sperma- tozoa gave greater survival in storage for horse and boar semen, but not for that of the bull. For the latter, however, storage without dilution at 40°F. for 12 to 30 hours has proved the most successful treatment. This paper reconsiders several of these points with regard to bull semen. The artificial vagina was used to collect semen from 10 bulls. Motility was rated from 0 to 5 at 100°F. under 250X magnification. Samples were divided and stored at 40° and 70°F. Motility after 6 hours storage was greater in that stored at 70°F., whereas after 16 hours the greater motility was found in that stored at 40°F. Samples stored at 70°F. were all dead after 40 hours while those stored at 40°F. were all alive. Samples were also diluted with 3 parts of diluents. Three and five per cent glucose solutions were harmful. Egg-yolk buffer (E. Y. B.) favoured motility up to five days after which the spermatozoa died rapidly. This effect, however, varied with different bulls. Fresh semen was centrifuged at 1300 revolutions per minute for 15 minutes after which the supernatant fluid was removed with a pipette. The remaining portion contained a concentration of spermatozoa. Such concentration greatly reduced motility during the first 48 hours. This was not overcome by replacing the sperm fluid immediately after eenfcrifugation with Milovanov's S-G-C-2 diluent or 3 per cent glucose solution ; four volumes of E. Y. B. diluent added at this time, however, increased motility for four days of storage. Here again the untreated semen survived
346 ABSTRACTS better after five days than the treated. Glucose is found in the sperm fluid, whereas E-Y-B contains none of this material. The addition of glucose to centrifuged samples containing E-Y-B diluent showed that glucose was not the limiting factor. Of 30 inseminations with stored semen, 15 effected conception. The results show that poor quality semen samples caused certain failures. The duration of successful storage varied with samples from the same bull. Untreated samples were just as good as treated samples. Conception resulted from one sample after 198 hours of storage, another after 115 hours. It was obvious that the genital mechanism of the cow also affected fertility, however the semen had been treated. Two inseminations per concep- tion is not thought to be an excessive ratio. It can be assumed, according to the authors, that ' a fair conception rate should result from use of good quality semen from fertile bulls which has been stored 48 to 72 hours, provided that it shows good motility at the time of insemination '. [J. N. W.] Market egg grades as affected by humidity of farm egg storage rooms. D. C. KENNARD AND V. D. CHAMBERLIN (1940). U. S. Egg and Poul. Mag. 46, 162 IT is generally supposed that if eggs are gathered frequently, stored in a sufficiently cool room (40 to 60° F.) and marketed regularly twice a week, they would meet the requirements of highest market grades, as far as the three or four day holding periods before marketing are concerned. Despite strict adherence to the above practice it was noticed that many eggs from the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station farm were graded mostly as U. S. Standards instead of as U. S. Extras, particularly during the cold weather. Other poultrymen also had a similar experience at about the same period. Investigation of the holding conditions revealed that humidity was the most variable factor. To find out the exact part played by humidity in the control of egg quality, experi- ments were conducted from February 3 to April 18 by alternately providing and with- holding supplemental moisture to the egg storage room over different similar periods. The eggs were stored in a basement cellar which maintained a fairly uniform desirable temperature, without difficulty, throughout the year. The supplemental moisture was provided by means of a small inexpensive nozzle to produce a spray from water under pressure and an 8" electric fan to stimulate the circulation of the moist air. Since the temperatures were comparable during the different periods the only variable factor was humidity. It was noticed that every time supplemental moisture was provided 86-100 per cent of the eggs graded as U. S. Extras whereas when extra humidity was absent the figure for this grade was down to 0-7.7 per cent. The result of one of these tests is given below:ABSTRACTS 347 in grade, providing extra moisture was rewarded with increased returns of 20 to 25 dollars a month on the basis of 8 to 10 cases of large eggs weekly. Seldom can such immediate increased cash returns, by the adoption of a practical, inexpensive procedure, be demonstrated so positively. Until more definite information becomes available the authors conclude that with a temperature of 50 to 60°F. in the egg holding room the relative humidity should be around 70 per cent and with a temperature of 60 to 70° F. it should be about 80 per cent. Under these conditions of temperature and humidity care should be taken to keep egg rooms clean and supply adequate circulation to prevent the growth of moulds and the develop- ment of musty odours. The use of supplemental moisture to reduce the loss of egg quality in egg storage rooms is now becoming a common practice in America, where the relative humidity of the atmosphere falls low, even though the temperature may be relatively low, and as the method is relatively inexpensive the same procedure might well be adopted in India with equally desirable results.

Med. 4, 333 ALTHOUGH the drug was first shown to have anthelmintic powers against worms in pigs and sheep, it has recently been shown to be of great value against strongyloid nematodes of horses, certain nematode parasites of cattle and cæcal worms of poultry. The data available are summarized under the heading of host animals as follows :348 ABSTRACTS Pigs, horses, and poultry may be dosed with the drug mixed with the food material.

Abst. & Rev. 10, 261 THE subject of vitamin A deficiency and requirements of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs for vitamin A have been reviewed under several heads, viz. symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in cattle, horses, pigs and sheep, its effect on reproduction, storage and depletion, minimum requirements of vitamin A, loss of carotene during preparation and storage of fodder, and relation of carotenoids in the food to the colour of milk and body fat. Dealing with the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, it is shown that the state of maturity, lactation, gestation, development, production, and rate of growth, all influence the onset of vitamin A deficiency symptoms. Eye lesions are the first characteristic and visible symptom of vitamin A deficiency and these lesions vary from profuse lachrymation and slight clouding of the cornea to extensive keratitis, ulceration of the cornea, loss of the aqueous humour, lens opacity and shrinking of eyeballs with complete and permanent blindness. Practically all the adult cows show night blindness without corneal lesions. Cows that are deficient only during the early months of pregnancy may give birth to permanently blind, but otherwise normal calves. In calves, deprived of carotene, permanent blindness was produced and this is presumed, to occur only in young animals because mature cows have the optic canal fully developed and calcified. Vitamin A deficiency may affect epithelial structures of the body as well as the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system. The respiratory tract is commonly affected and pneumonia is usually the ter- minal condition, causing death. In horses, roaring, stringhalt, navicular disease and bony exostoses are considered to be manifestations of vitamin A deficiency as well as Ca and P imbalance. In Finland, Klemola showed that faulty hoofs in the army horses were due to vitamin A deficiency. In pigs, besides paralysis, other symptoms due to vitamin A deficiency are loss of appetite, cessation of growth, impairment of vision in daylight, abnormal gait and convulsive fits leading to nervous collapse. Pneumonia is of course, the cause of death. These conditions are corrected if 0.5-2 per cent cod liver oil were incorporated in the feed. In sheep, night blindness is common and in some cases permanent defective vision in semi-darkness results, irrespective of subsequent vitamin A intake or storage. In aged ewes, night blindness did not manifest itself before 22 months had elapsed. As in cattle, vitamin A reserve was used up more rapidly during the first year than subsequently. As urinary calculi are more common in sheep than in any other farm species, efforts were also made to trace its etiology to vitamin A deficiency, but no definite proof was obtained. Reproduction is adversely affected ; 25 to 30 cows calving at the height of vitamin A deficiency brought forth calves which were weak, had severe diarrhoea and died in 1 to 5 days. Cessation of spermatogenesis in bulls, which also occurs at the height of the deficiency, is not permanent. Again, with ewes it was found that the ability to conceive is affected late in the deficiency but failure of gestation is a relatively early manifestation. Coming to the question of storage and depletion, it has been found that the reserves of vitamin A in the newborn are low ; indications are also there to show that pregnant mother on high vitamin A intake is unable to supply vitamin A to the foetus much faster than it is utilized. Maximum storage occurs in adults of advanced age. Liver is the main seat of reserve, although the reserve in blood stream is also significant. To main- tain existing reserves, the intake must considerably be in excess of minimum requirements and still greater to provide for storage in depleted animals. In mammals 20 to 30 Y per kg. body weight constitute the daily requirement of carotene and 4.6 to 6.1 Y of vitamin A. In practice, at least 5 to 10 times this minimum level is recommended. Artificially dried hays, generally speaking, are high in carotene content than field cured hay. The loss of carotene in alfalfa fodder prepared by vacuum drying is negligible;
ABSTRACTS 349 autoclaving destroys 33 to 67.5 per cent and sun drying causes a loss of 69.5 per cent. It has been shown that enzymes are at least partly responsible for this loss. In storage under practical conditions, losses of carotene are serious during summer. Ensiling is an important method of preserving forage and preventing the loss of carotene. Carotene is the principal pigment in the body and milk fat of cattle. Swine, sheep and goat tissues do not contain any appreciable amount of pigment and their body fat is white. In the grassfed animals, carotene is present in greatest quantity and one of the commonly occurring off-flavours in milk termed ' oxidized ' is corrected when the ration fed is rich in carotene. [ B. N. M.] Pulmonary tuberculosis in man as a source of infection for cattle. F. W. NIELSEN, AND N. PLUM (1940). Vet. J. 96 THE question of transmission of tuberculous infection from man to cattle plays too great a role to be ignored when undertaking work in connection with the eradica- tion of tuberculosis in cattle. Two kinds of tuberculous infection are transmitted from man to cattle, namely : (1) infection of cattle from man with tubercle bacilli of the human type, and (2) infection of cattle from man with tubercle bacilli of the bovine type. The authors describe the presence of tuberculous lesion in the mesenteric lymph gland of a heifer with tuberculous infection of human type transmitted by one of the farm attendants. Then they proceed to describe 17 cases of tuberculosis in which perfectly healthy cattle have been infected from persons with open pulmonary tuberculosis due to the bovine type of tubercle bacilli. The 17 herds which had been free from reacting animals had 632 head of cattle in all, out of which 384 gave a positive tuberculin reaction The authors enumerate the difficulties encountered in effecting the proper medical examination of the suspected personnel of the infected farms and suggest that legal measures be enacted to provide for this medical examination and that all tuberculous persons owning or attending cattle have their infection type determined under Govern- ment authority and that the Veterinary Directorate be notified at once of all cases in which infection with bovine type is demonstrated. [ K. I.] The colorimetric estimation of uric acid in fowl's excreta. J. C. D. HUTCHINSON (1941). Biochem. J. 35, 81 THE author has described a colorimetric method for the determination of uric acid in fowl's excreta. This method is claimed to be more specific and less laborious than other methods at present in use. It consists in extracting uric acid from air-dried excreta with 0.5 per cent lithium carbonate solution. The uric acid is precipitated from an aliquot of the filtered extract by the Benedict and Hitchcock ' ammoniacal silver magnesium precipitant'. After removal of ammonia by a current of air the precipitate is decomposed with 7 per cent lithium chloride in 0.125 N hydrochloric acid solution. The decomposition of the precipitate by acid chloride not only removes the silver but has the advantage of bringing down most of the colouring matter. The uric acid is then finally estimated colorimetrically by the addition of Benedict's arsenophosphotungstic acid reagent. The author has tested the method by recovering different quantities of uric acid from ' nearly uric acid free ' fowl's excreta obtained by separating mechanically uric acid from normal excreta. The amount of uric acid added was recovered quantitatively over the whole range of conditions likely to be encountered in practice. The specificity of the method has also been tested by adding uric acid and. ammonium urate to sheep's and human faeces, as it is difficult to obtain fowl's excreta completely free from uric acid. These tests show that the method is highly specific and gives good results under conditions which caused a failure of the methods of Woodman [1924] and of St. John and Johnson [1931]. [S. B.]
350 ABSTRACTS A quantitative study of vitamins in the rumen contents of sheep and cows fed on vitamin low diets. L. W. McELROY and HAROLD GOSS (1940- 41). (1) Riboflavin and Vitamin K. J. Nutrition 20, 527. (2) Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine). J. Nutrition, 20, 541. (3) Thiamin. J. Nutrition 21, 163. (4) Pantothenic acid. J. Nutrition, 21, 405 THE authors have pointed out that owing to the lack of more recent knowledge in the field of the complex nature of B vitamins and also to the lack of well- defined methods of assaying, the problem of vitamin B requirements of ruminants was much handicapped. Attempts have, therefore, been made, in these papers to establish the synthesis of (1) riboflavin and vitamin K, (2) vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), (3) thiamin and (4) pantothenic acid in the rumen of sheep and cows, one of the cows having a permanent rumen-fistula. For riboflavin assay a modification of the method of Jukes [1937], for vitamin K assay the method of Almquist and Klose [1939], for vitamin B6 assay a modified method of Dimick and Schreffler [1939], for thiamin assay the method of Jukes and Heitman [1940] and for pantothenic acid assay the 'filtrate factor' method of Jukes [1937] were employed. (1) On a deficient ration with less than 0.3 microgram of riboflavin per gram, the rumen contents of sheep contained 33 micrograms and of fistulated cow 25 micrograms of riboflavin per gram. The riboflavin contents of milk produced was 16 to 18 mg. per day, a figure rather too high as compared with maximal intake of only 1.8 mg. per day in the feed. Though the experimental ration of the cow was practically free from vitamin K, the rumen proved to be a considerable rich source of it. (2) On a deficient ration containing between 1 and 1.5 micrograms of vitamin B6 per gram, the dried rumen and reticulum contents of four sheep and a fistulated cow contained approximately 10 micrograms and 8 micrograms of vitamin B6 per gram respectively, the amount in milk being in no way less than that of cows on normal feed. (3) The dried rumen and reticulum contents of sheep fed on deficient ration con- raining less than 0.4 microgram of thiamin per gram contained approximately 7 micro- grams of thiamin per gram, but, contrary to expectation, the dried rumen contents of a fistulated cow yielded no more thiamin than was present in the basal diet, while the analysis of milk showed an appreciable amount of the vitamin. Experimental results, however, showed that thiamin could be obtained from the rumen of the non-fistulated cow on a deficient ration, which suggested that the presence of an artificial opening in the rumen might have altered the physiological functions in such a way as to render it unfavourable for the growth of rumen organisms, capable of synthesising thiamin. (4) Pantothenic acid of the rumen and reticulum contents estimated on dry matter basis per gram was 70 micrograms in the case of sheep, 61 micrograms in the case of non- fistulated and 94 micrograms in the case of fistulated cow, the animals in all cases being on a vitamin B-complex deficient diet with utmost maximum availability of even less than 2.8 micrograms of pantothenic acid per gram. Dried skim milk from the milk of the fistulated cow showed an excretion of 46 micrograms of pantothenic acid per gram. In the light of the aforesaid observations, it seemed to the authors that the differen- tial passage of materials from the rumen as a possible cause of increase in the vitamin potency of its contents was inadequate to explain in the face of such high increase. The authors therefore concluded that these vitamins were truly synthesised in the rumen of these animals by the bacterial flora and as such were" not dietary essentials in their ration. [A. K. P.] Studies on Listerella infection in sheep. H. E. BRISTER and L. H, SCHWARTE (1939). J. Infec. Dis. 64, 135-44 THE authors describe the isolation of Listerella (ovis) from brain tissue of sheep in two field outbreaks of a disease characterized by disturbance of the central nervous system. Histological examination of brain and spinal cord of affected cases
ABSTRACTS 351 revealed changes associated with poliomyelitis. A detailed account of investigations into various aspects of the disease and transmission experiments is given. Attempts to reproduce the disease in sheep by intracerebral inoculations with filtered brain sus- pension gave negative results. But unfiltered material or cultures inoculated intracere- brally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly into sheep and pigs produced lesions identical with those seen in natural cases. Intranasal instillation of the virulent material failed to transmit the disease. Direct cultures from the brain often remained sterile but in order to isolate the organisms large quantity of brain suspension had to be planted on agar or liver infusion agar. The organisms remained viable in brain tissue for several months when stored in 50 per cent neutral glycerine in the refrigerator. The authors state (details not recorded) that Listerella (ovis) can more consistently be isolated from brain of rabbits inoculated intracerebrally with infected tissue. [J.A.I.] ' Swayback', a demyelinating disease of lambs with affinities to Schilder's encephalitis in man. J. R. M. INNES and G. D. SHEARER (1940). J. Comp. Path. 53, 1-44 BESIDES the well-known group of neurotropic virus infections, in which there is a greater tendency for the disease to affect the gray matter (polioclastic types of encephalitis), there are several affections of the central nervous system which may be grouped as the demyelination diseases (myelinoclastic types of encephalitis), in which the essential lesion, in contrast with the former group, is demyelination. This demyelination may occur as scattered foci (in disseminated sclerosis), as perivascular areas (in post-vaccinial encephalitis), or as massive, diffuse, sometimes symmetrical areas (in Schilder's disease 352 ABSTRACTS Histologically, demyelination was the constant lesion encountered, and all grada- tions of change ranging from small foci to a total loss of myelin were present. In some cases, where no naked eye changes had been observed, small foci of demyelination were visible, often confined to the centrum ovale of the occipital lobes. In the cortical gray matter, the nerve cells generally preserved their form and it was only in the most severely affected cases accompanied by gross liquefaction of the white matter that early dege- nerative changes (shrinkage, vacuolation, displaced pyknotic nuclei, chromatolysis) were noticed, especially in the red nucleus. Neuronophagia, inflammatory cellular infiltration and inclusion bodies were absent. Gliosis was never intense : the cells con- cerned in this reaction appeared to be the fibrous astrocytes. In Marchi-Busch pre- parations, degenerated fibres could occasionally be traced through the capsules and mid- brain to the medulla and cord. Identical histological changes were observed in brain sections from four Australian lambs examined by the authors. Ewes which give birth to ' swayback ' lambs appear to be healthy and may give birth to healthy or affected lambs. No significant lesions were noticed in six such lambs autopsied. Bacteria or viruses could not be incriminated in the causation of this disease. It is neither hereditary nor developmental in nature, though the disease process seems to be antenatal. Biochemically, low serum phosphorus values were obtained in a few ' swayback ' lambs and ewes. The suggestion is made that ' swayback ' may be due to a disturbance of copper metabolism, as chemical analyses of the blood of ' swayback ' lambs and their mothers showed lower copper values compared with suitable controls. A con- firmation of this view is sought for in the success which has attended the prevention of ' swayback ' by feeding copper to the pregnant ewes in Australia and England. This disease, however, is not a copper deficiency per se, as pasture analyses did not reveal a deficiency of this element. The possibility that lead is concerned in some way with the development of the disease cannot be excluded at present. [R. N.
