REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON FOR THE YEAR 1907. The Burma Government Medical School was formally opened on 4th February 1907 by Colonel King, the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma. The session commenced with ten students nine of whom were in receipt of stipends and one was a private student. Of the former one was a female student. Sub- sequently five more students were admitted one as a stipend student, four as private students. Thus by the end of February there were in all fifteen students. The following was the distribution of students according to race:2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1907. subjects. In consequence the lecturers had to resort to the method of giving the students set tasks daily to learn and then testing their knowledge by question and answers. Though no doubt this method instilled a certain amount of knowledge into their brains it is not a desirable one for young men. It not only hampers the lecturer and renders his work irksome but it also keeps back the more intelligent and brighter students. As the question of the standard of qualification desirable for medical students has been made the subject of a previous communication I do not propose to go further into the question here. The lecturing staff has been sufficient but it must be remembered there were only the first year's students to deal with. As the school continues and increased there will eventually be four classes of students to instruct, i.e., first, second, third and fourth year's students. The staff of lecturers as now consisted will then be inadequate. At present the Commissioned Officers each lecture twice a week; when the school has reached its full proportions it will become necessary for them to lecture at least once a day. I would point out apart from the time spent on delivering a lecture itself, the preparation of the subject entails considerable time and study. I therefore suggest that it will be advisable at an early date to increase the staff of the lecturers. This might be done by appointing the Chemical Examiner to the staff; and also the second Resident Medical Officer and the Pathologist as soon as these latter appointments to the General Hospital staff are sanctioned. The Chemical Examiner is obviously the man best fitted to lecture on Chemistry and Toxicology. While the Pathologist who is also I believe to be Police Surgeon would have special qualifications for lecturing on medical jurisprudence. The second Resident Medical Officer would probably take Physiology. The following is a table showing the results of the final examination of the students held at the completion of one year's study.

The two students who passed first and second did much better than the rest, this I attribute to the fact that they were both thoroughly conversant with English. The Burmese female student Ma Nellie Pathie is an intelligent self-respecting girl from the Baptist Karen Mission. I hope the Missions may be able to furnish us with more students of this class; they are likely to be of great use to the Province. Receipts and Expenditure. Total receipts during the year, collected as fees from private students and fines amounted to Rs. 57-2-0. Total expenditure for the same period was Rs. 13,457-13-1 and was as follows:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1907. 3 Rs. A. P.

As regards the students themselves they have generally shown themselves hardworking and eager to learn especially I am glad to say the Burmese ones. That good Hospital Assistants can be obtained from amongst the Burmese I feel sure and that it is only a question of raising the stipends and in placing the school on a thoroughly sound basis to ensure success. At present the extent to which Burmans avail themselves of western modes of medical treatment is far from satisfactory and this want of confidence is largely due to the paucity of Hospital Assistants of their own race. The only method of supplying this deficiency is by maintaining a Medical School in Burma and till that is done we must be content with the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. C.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON FOR THE YEAR 1908. The year 1908 was not one of progress for the Medical School. Repeated attempts to select a new batch of students to commence their studies during the year proved unsuccessful and the number on the rolls remained the same as in the previous year. 2. No additions were made to the building and accommodation during the year as, for only one class of 13 students, the present accommodation was ample. Serious difficulty will, however, be felt in a year or two when the work of the school is in full swing with four classes to teach. There is only one room in the school which can be utilised as a lecture room, and in many other respects the accommodation is very limited. 3. The want of a proper laboratory is greatly felt. At present all practical work has to take the form of demonstratio ns, and in those cases where the students are made to do practical work themselves they have to be divided into small batches of three or four for want of a properly fitted up room and sufficient apparatus. In the case of Anatomy, however, these difficulties did not exist, and a systematic course of dissection was carried on throughout the year. The dissection room has already a fairly complete set of anatomical specimens, and a set of pathological specimens is in course of preparation, but if we had our full com- pliment of students the space would be much overcrowded. 4. The subjects taught during the year were Anatomy (advanced course), Materia Medica, and Surgery (Elementary course). The practical training consisted of dissection of the dead body, pharmacy, and clinical instruction in the Hospital. The practical pharmacy course was conducted in the Compounding Room of the Hospital. The following is a detailed account of the instructions given during the year:2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1908. The hours of instruction were from 7-30 A.M. to 11 A.M. in the Hospital for practical training and from 2 P.M. to 4 P.M. in the school for lectures. 5. The attendance at lectures was very good. Unlike the previous year the health of the students was good and the average attendance for the year was 97.9 per cent. 6. The conduct of the students was very satisfactory and their progress in their studies moderately so. They were on the whole hardworking and willing to learn, but their imperfect knowledge of English is still a very serious obstacle in their way. This not only made their studies more laborious but also prevented their giving clear expression to their ideas in examinations. The following is a table showing the results of the Annual Examination held in December 1908 at the completion of the second year's course:REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1908. 3 10. On the whole the progress of the school during the year cannot be said to have been very satisfactory. Failure to obtain a new batch of students to com- mence their studies during the year was discouraging, both to the teachers and the old students. A new class has, however, been started on the 1st January 1909, and already signs are not wanting to show that the enthusiasm among the boys has increased and that they are beginning to take a more lively interest in their work. 11 The new set has the same general education as the old, but in comparison with the latter at present they appear to be much inferior. 12. Although the stipends have been raised to four times their original amount with the object of making the course attractive to Burmese candidates with higher general education, the result has not yet justified the hope. This state of things will probably continue until the status of Hospital Assistants is improved. R. E. S. DAVIS, M.B., LT.-COL., I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Government Medical School, Rangoon.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1909. The year 1909 was one of some progress for the Medical School. One batch of students commenced their studies from January 1909 and another from September 1909. 2. No additions were made to the building accommodation during the year. 3. The General Hospital and the Medical School libraries are combined into one, and we have now a fairly complete collection of recent medical books. 4.

The hours of instruction were from 7 to 11 A.M. in the Hospital for practical training and 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. in the School for lectures. 6. The attendance, the health, and the conduct of the students were satis- factory. 7. All the students in the first batch passed the prescribed examination and were promoted to the fourth year. Cut of ten of the second batch four failed and were removed from the School; even those that remain are far below the average standard. 8. Of the twenty-eight students, twenty-three students received stipends from Government and five were private students. 9. The total receipts during the year amounted to Rs. 70-6-0 and the total expenditure was Rs. 20,414-8-3. The detailed accounts are given in State- ment F. 10. The accommodation of the Medical School is now insufficient, and when ten more students enter in July will be overcrowded. There is only one class room and one dissecting room, both measuring about 20'× 18', and four small rooms about 10'×18' used as office, lady students' room, laboratory, and infec- tion room. 11. The fourth year students are doing well, and will be out by the end of November as qualified Sub-Assistant Surgeons. E. R.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1912-13. 1. The present Report, unlike the previous ones, deals with the working of the school for the past 15 months, viz., from the 1st January 1912 to the 31st March 1913. The number of students on the rolls on the 1st January 1912 was 42 as against 29 of the last year, viz., 17 in the first year, 11 in the second and 14 in the third year. Of these 31 received stipends from the Government and 11 were private students. 2. There were two annual examinations during the period under report. The annual examinations for the year 1911 were held at the end of March 1912. All the second year students were promoted to the third year; 14 out of 17 first year students were promoted to the second year, the remaining three were remanded for one year; and 11 out of 14 third year students were promoted to the fourth year; the failures in this year were removed from the school. 3. The school re-opened in the first week of July after the long midsummer vacation. Twenty new students were admitted, viz., 19 in the first year and one in the fourth year. Of these 10 were public students and the remaining private, one of the latter is a Burman. All the public students except one are also Burmans. Among the new admissions there were 4 students who had the required educational qualifications. Statement D shows the qualifications of the new admissions into the school. 4. At the beginning of the session in July there were 59 students on the rolls, viz., 22 in the first year, 14 in the second year, 11 in the third year and 12 in the fourth year. Of these 36 received stipends from the Government and 23 were private students. 5. The annual examinations for 1912-13 were held at the end of March 1913. Out of 12 students, who were sent up for the final professional Board Examination, 10 were declared to have passed. Out of 14 students, who appeared for the Junior Board Examination, to passed (i.e., obtained 50 per cent. of the marks allotted), one recommended to be re-examined and three failed. Eleven third year students sat for the promotion examination, of whom three failed, one to be re-examined and 7 promoted to the fourth year class. Twenty appeared from the first year class, of whom nine failed to secure 5o per cent. of the marks given and were recommended for removal in accordance with the rules of the school; 11 were promoted to the second year class. 6. I consider that the work done by all the students, except those of the first year, was very creditable. The large percentage of failures in the first year was disappointing. Only four students of this year had the necessary English qualifications. One student had only passed the VI standard and failed hope- lessly in his examination, which is not surprising. Three had only passed the VII standard and six each the VIII and IX standards respectively. The subjects of the first year are very dry and difficult ones, which it is almost impossible to make really interesting to students, and I myself think the first year at medicine is the most difficult one of all. On the other hand, it is better for the school and the students themselves that the failures should be weeded out early, instead of later in their third or fourth year, when removal from the school would be a

I went through all the papers of the first year personally with the object of finding out if the questions set for examination were fair ones, and also to find out if the marking was on too severe a scale. I found that the questions were all absolutely fair and that every chance was given to the examinees. Those who failed quite deserved to do so, and I saw no necessity to interfere with the results given me by the examiners. 7. The attendance of the students during the year was, on the whole, satis- factory. 8. The following is a detailed account of instruction given during the year.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1912-13. 3 9. The school was removed to the old General Hospital building at the beginning of the session and a hostel is also attached to the school. 10. The total receipts during the period under report were Rs. 354 and the expenditure amounted to Rs, 40,126-11-0. There has been a considerable increase in expenditure owing to the purchase of furniture for the school and the hostel. 11. The hostel started from July 1912 with 25 boarders. Seven new boarders were admitted in August and September, thus making a total of 32 boarders, which is, at present, the maximum number that can be accommodated. Out of these 32, 21 were Burmese and Chinese, six native Christians, two Hindus and three Mahomedans. The hostel is supervised by an Assistant Lecturer of the school under the control of the Superintendent. At the beginning there were some difficulties in managing the food for the hostel departmentally owing to divergence of taste according to different nationalities. The contract system, which was introduced in the latter part of the year, has worked satisfactorily. Finance.-The hostel, as it stands at present, is purely a self-supporting institution, and receives no pecuniary help from outside. The total receipts from the boarders during the year were Rs. 5,347-9-7, and the total expenditure was Rs. 5,140-2-6, leaving a balance of Rs. 207-7-1. 12. General Remarks.-Major Rost, I.M.S., acted as Superintendent of the school up to the date he went on leave, viz., the 11th November 1912, and from that date onwards, the writer of this Report took his place and held it up to the end of the session. Assistant Surgeon Y. Subrahmanyam took up the duties of an Assistant Lecturer on the 25th October 1912 in place of Assistant Surgeon P. R. Menon transferred the latter held the appointment very ably since the establishment of the school up to the date of his departure from the school. The lecturers and the assistant lecturers of the school worked very enthusiastically. Ten final year students, who have passed the final Board Examination, have been sent to Madras to undergo a course of practical training in midwifery in the Madras Maternity Hospital. The want of a Maternity Hospital attached, if possible, to the Medical School, mainly for the benefit of the students, is a factor that cannot be ignored, and the establishment of such an institution seems to me a most pressing need. The unnecessary extra expenditure incurred on account of passage of students, and the inconvenience caused to them in a foreign land can only then be avoided. One of the chief objections to the Madras arrange- ment is that the students are first taught theoretically in a practical subject and their actual practical work, instead of being taken pari passu with the mere book- work, is deferred until the course of lectures is finished. Major Barry (one of the examiners) asked a student what he would do for a certain form of dangerous hæmorrhage. The reply according to the books was perfectly correct, but when told that it was a question of minutes, within which the hæmorrhage should be stopped if life was to be saved, he (the examinee) was absolutely non-plussed, and could give no idea of what immediate treatment he would adopt. He knew theoretically all the things that might be done, but the absence of practical know- ledge rendered such theoretical knowledge useless. Going to Madras is also a strain on the students, as it adds another three months to their course of lectures. P. DEE, M.B., Major, I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Government Medical School, Rangoon.

On the whole the working of the Burma Government Medical School has been one of progress since its opening. It is to be regretted that changes in the lecturing and teaching staff have occurred, but these have been necessitated by transfers of officers owing to the war. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, A. O. EVANS, Col.I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.
REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON FOR THE YEAR 1914-15. The year commenced with 32 students on the rolls, namely 14 in the second year, 7 in the third year and 11 in the fourth year classes. One of the 14 second year students was a remanded public student. Of the 11 fourth year students, 2 died of plague in July 1914, hence there were only 30 pupils at the commencement of the session as follows:2 REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR 1914-15. From the 20th July 1914 to March 1915REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR 1914-15. 3 hostel and lecture halls were also extended so as to provide sufficient accommoda- tion for the increased number of students. There is now room for 80 boarders in the hostel and no further extension is therefore needed. The tennis court was fenced in with American wire to prevent the public from using it as a thoroughfare and the work was completed at the end of the year. 8. The total receipts during the year were Rs. 145-8, and the expenditure was Rs. 39,241-6-7. 9. Establishment.-The pay of the office establishment was revised during the year under report and two additional servants were also appointed. 10. Hostel Finance.-The total receipts during the year were Rs. 7,742-7-2 and the expenditure amounted to Rs. 6,918-14-4 leaving a balance of Rs. 823-8-10. The accounts of the Hostel Fund were audited during August 1914. Proposals were submitted to Government to revise the pay of the Hostel servants and for the appointment of additional hands, which was duly sanctioned. 11. General.- I regret to say that the discipline of the school has not been as good as in former years. Students have shown a tendency to take short leave without permission, to arrive late for lectures and to absent themselves from the hospital without valid excuse. The above state of affairs is I think due to the many changes which occur- red during the year in the staff of the school brought about by the exigencies of the war. Assistant Surgeon Y. Subrahmanyam, who was in sub-charge of the school, was removed almost without notice as his services were urgently required else- where. His loss was felt badly as he had an intimate knowledge of the working of the school, and a wonderful control over the students. I held charge throughout the year with Assistant Surgeon J. S. Lamech as Hostel Master and Assistant Surgeon L. Htin Poh in sub-charge of the school from the 14th November 1914. P. DEE, M.B., Major, I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Govt. Medical School, Rangoon.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma in the Medical Department,( 2 ) 2. During the year under report the school has received from Mr. A. K. A. S. Jamal, C.I.E., a generous donation of Rs. 1,000, the interest on which is to be devoted to the purchase of a gold medal to be presented annually to the student who heads the list at the final examination. Sir Harcourt Butler desires to express his thanks to Mr. Jamal for this proof of his interest not only in education generally, but also in those branches of education which by means of practical training are preparing students for a useful and honourable career. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, C. M. WEBB, Secretary to the Government of Burma.
From Colonel A. O. EVANS, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma, to the Secretary to the Government of Burma,ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. 1. The year began with 44 students on the rolls, namely, 21 in the second year, 17 in the third year, and 6 in the fourth year classes. Of the 17 of the third year class 3 were remanded public students, while 14 were from the second year class. Seven of the latter were re-examined after six months and one had to be removed as he failed in the examination though remanded once in his second year. 2. The new sessions commenced on the 19th July 1915 when 20 were selected as public and 12 as private students; one of the latter, who came from the Madras Royapuram Medical School, was admitted into the fourth year class. Of the remaining 11 private students, 1 failed to join and 2 left after a few weeks. Two of the 20 public students also left during the year, one in November and another in December 1915. Of the 31 new admissions, 12 only possessed the requisite educational qualifications, but most of the remainder either studied up to, or failed at, the Matric or High School Final Examination. Statement D shows that the number of admissions with the required educational qualifications is steadily on the increase, and it is hoped to get this year as many, if not more, fully qualified candidates for the approaching session. 3. The behaviour and attendance of all the students with the exception of one or two were satisfactory during the year under report. The health of the students was exceptionally good. 4. The following is a detailed account of instruction given during the year from 20th July 1915 to 31st March 1916:2 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR 1915-16.

STRICKLAND, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA. Dated Maymyo, the 23rd May 1919. SIR, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Burma Medical School for the year ending 31st March 1919. 2. At the commencement of the new sessions in July 1918, the number of students on the rolls was 107 excluding the new admissions of 40 of whom 25 were public, 14 private, 1 (Maung Ohn Ghine) scholar. Of these, 16 (including 6 who volunteered for military service) passed out, 5 left otherwise and 1 died, leaving 125 students on the rolls on the 31st March 1919. 3. The number of students taught during the year as classified according to nationalities was 8o Burmese (including 2 females), 56 Indians (including 1 female), 7 Anglo-Indians (including 4 females) and 4 Chinese; and when classified according to religions, the Buddhists top the list with 53 closely followed by Hindus, 47, while the numbers of Christian and Mahomedan students were 36 (including 6 females) and 11 (including 1 female) respectively. 4. It is very gratifying to note that all the new admissions save one possess the requisite educational qualification, while the one exception has also passed the IX standard examination which is very near the mark. 5. The total amount expended for the up-keep of the Burma Government Medical School in the year under report was Rs. 75,488-11-4 as against Rs. 61,287-12-1 in the year previous, resulting in a nett increase of Rs, 14,200-15-3 contributed mainly by " allowances to lecturers, travelling allowance to students, stipends to students and allowances to Superintendent." 6. I have much pleasure in placing on record the generous donations received from Messrs. Ramanatha Reddiar and Maung Zan, Head Master of the Roman Catholic Mission School, Thônzè and his brothers, and Colonel Kanta Prasad, M.D., I.M.S., of Rs. 1,000 each for the award of "Devi Ammal Gold Medal," "U Ba Oh Gold Medal" and "Colonel Kanta Prasad Gold Medal." Colonel Dee, I.M.S., awarded a medal to one of the two competitors between whom there was a tie in the results of the final examination in Surgery. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, P. C. H. STRICKLAND, Col.,I.M S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA GOVERNMENT MEDICAL SCHOOL RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1918-19 1. The year started with 107 students on the roll as against 70 last year, namely:(2) 2. At the commencement of the session in July 1918, 37 students joined, of Whom 25 are public, II private and I (Maung Ohn Ghine) scholar. Two more pri- vate students joined later, one in August and another in September. An old second year public student, named Maung Ohn, who left the school in 1917 was permitted to rejoin as private student in September 1918. All the newly admitted students are educationally qualified, and several qualified applicants had to be rejected as the sanctioned number of annual admissions as stipendiary students is only 25. Altogether 40 students were admitted during the year under review, but private student M. Alam, who went for the Indian Defence Force training in November 1918 did not return, and Po Aye, another private student, left without notice in February 1919. 3. The character and health of the students on the whole was good and satisfactory during the year under report, except that a few students suffered from Influenza. 4. The following is a detailed account of instructions given during the year:(3) Rs. 61,287-12-1 respectively of last year. The increase in receipt is due to the increase in the number of private students, and that in expenditure is mainly due to the enhancement of lecture allowance from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 a month, which has taken effect from the 15th July 1918. 8. Hostel.( 4 ) It is with great regret that I have to record the death of Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. Sargent, I.M.S., on active service in May 1918. He was lecturer on Medicine from the 11th March 1915 to the 4th March 1917, and his loss was a severe one for the school as he spared no effort to make his subject interesting and intelligible to the students, and his practical demonstrations in the hospital wards were models of what clinical lectures should be. I was in charge of the school throughout the year, except from the 7th January 1919 to the 19th February 1919, when Major W. V. Coppinger, D.S.O., I.M,S., acted for me. Civil Assistant Surgeons D. R. Lewis, M.B., and J. S. Lamech, L.R.C.P. & S. were in sub-charge of the school and hostel. Sub- Assistant Surgeon R. S. Grewal was appointed as Demonstrator in the school during the year under report. I wish to thank all three for their excellent work throughout the year. P. DEE, Lieut.-Col., I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Govt. Medical School, Rangoon,

MEDICAL DEPARTMENT No. 6871.( 2 ) The school suffers from inadequate and unsuitable accommodation which becomes more accentuated year by year as the number of students increase. The central portion of the main building has, up to date, been utilized as a residence for the Hostel-master. This arrangement is thoroughly bad, as there is no separate entrance to the quarters and outsiders of all descriptions gain free access to the school. I propose to do away with these residential quarters and hand them over to the school to relieve the present overcrowding. Members of the Staff of the General Hospital still occupy quarters in the School Compound, but it is hoped that the necessary buildings will soon be provided for them in the Hospital Compound. A Drill Instructor was sanctioned in the beginning of the year and all students now go through a course of both squad and stretcher drill. Recreation has not been neglected and games such as tennis and foot-ball, are popular amongst the students. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. ENTRICAN, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., Lieut.-Colonel, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.
