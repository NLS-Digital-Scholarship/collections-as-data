His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., I.C.S., Governor of Burma, kindly presided and distributed the prizes at the annual prize distribution of the school, and the presence of the Hon'ble Minister for Education at this distribution was a most welcome feature on the occasion. 8. Though still hampered by the want of a play-ground in the vicinity of the school, yet the activities of the school in the field of sport were in no way lacking as may be seen from the laurels won by the students in the various competitions detailed by Colonel Whit- more, I.M.S., in his Report. 9. The formation of the School Union is an asset to the Institu- tion, and I am glad to observe it has done its good " bit " during the Health Week Exhibition held at Rangoon. 10. I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Superintendent and his staff for the able and efficient manner in which they have discharged their onerous duties in spite of the several changes in the teaching staff which has evidently not impaired efficiency. Lieutenant-Colonel Whitmore's work as Superintendent has been excellent, and he has been ably helped by Major Passanha, and Dr. Lewis. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, P. DEE, Colonel, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.

MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 5 near future, give us an opportunity of teaching more efficiently and introducing practical work. Forty-five Third year students went to Madras on the 6th April 1923 under charge of Civil Assistant Surgeon D. R. Lewis to undergo three months' training in practical midwifery at the Government Maternity Hospital, Madras, and they returned on the 9th July 1923. One lady student Miss A. Tardival underwent practical Midwifery training at the Dufferin Hospital, Rangoon. Indoor and outdoor games have been zealously played. The students competed in the B.A.A. tournaments in Football, Hockey, Tennis and the Annual Athletic Sports They won again the Junior Challenge Cup and were runners up in the Junior League Football Competition. Four of our students played for Rangoon in the District Football Challenge Cup and helped to win the Beehive Trophy. They were runners up in the Tennis Doubles Handicap. This is the first year the school entered the Hockey competition, they drew in almost all matches. The Third year students won the Inter-year Football Shield. The Fourth year won the Squad Shield and Medals and the Second year the Stretcher Shield and Medals. A proper playing ground for the school is still a sad want; but until the Municipal grounds are ready, we will have to carry on a hand to mouth existence. I am glad to say that during the year the general vitality of the school has been well maintained, which was shown by the zeal and energy displayed by the students in taking a very active part in the Health Week Exhibition. Their part of the Exhibition was organized and run by the School Union, to the members of which my thanks are due. A. WHITMORE, Lt.-Col., M.D., I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Government Medical School, Rangoon.

They won the Junior Challenge Football Cup for the third year in succession, the Junior League Football Cup, and the Junior Hockey Cup. The fourth-year students won the Inter-year football shield and medals. The fourth year won the squad shield and medals and the third year the stretcher drill shield and medals. A suitable playing ground for the school is still a sad want. Arrangements are being made to convert the vacant ground in the old hospital compound into a sports ground for use of the students. During the year the general vitality of the school has been well maintained which was shown by the zeal and energy displayed by the students in taking a very active part in the Health Week Exhibition. The students gave a fine gymnastic and muscular display at the annual entertainment held in December 1924, which was run by the Medical Students' Union. J. FULLER GOOD, M.B., Lt.-Col., I.M.S., Superintendent, Burma Government Medical School, Rangoon.

EXAMINATIONS2 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE BURMA result of the Intermediate examination was so unsatisfactory was that this batch of students admitted in the previous year, formed the last first year class it was proposed to admit, and had in consequence been treated with too great leniency in the Primary examination (of 23 all passed). The school was closing down, and it was desired not to keep the classes in Preliminary Science open for a handful of failures, so the whole batch was allowed to pass, some at least should not have been allowed to do so. The consequence of the leniency is seen in the high failure rate in the Intermediate examination of April 1927. PART II. 2. Vacation.3 GOVT. MEDICAL SCHOOL, RANGOON, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28. 1927.

This resolution has been forwarded to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals and a small Committee has been appointed to go into the matter and to submit recommendations for improving the course. It is hoped that the Committee will report in time to enable a start to be made on sound lines at an early date. The expedient of teaching the students of the school in the same building and in the same departments as the students of the Medical College in so far as the subjects of Anatomy and of Physiology are concerned has proved at any rate justifiable and it is not going too far to state that with better co-ordination and with raising the standard of teaching in the Burma Government Medical School the advantages would be such as to justify the expedient and to improve the quality of medical aid in the out-stations of the Districts and in the District headquarters also.

The students competed in football, tennis and hockey of the Burma Athletic Association. The first year students won both the inter-year Squad and Stretcher- bearer drill shields and medals. The third-year students won the inter- year football shield and medals. The attempt to include courses of Botany and of Zoology in the curriculum has been beneficial to the students, but it was found that this prejudiced the teaching in Physics and in Chemistry which could not be completed within the time allotted to the four subjects. It has therefore been decided to substitute for the courses in Botany and in Zoology an elementary course in Biology consisting of one lecture and demonstration per week throughout the session. The improvement in the teaching of the subjects of Physiology and of Anatomy continues and has been maintained during the year under review. L. A. H.

I also wish to acknowledge the keenness and energy displayed by the Lecturers, Assistant Lecturers and Demonstrators in the discharge of their respective duties, and I must make special mention of the name of the late Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. Jones, D.S.O., I.M.S., whose untimely death at the close of the session was a great loss to the school. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. A.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Public Health Department,MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.( ii ) Final Examination Part II, 27 out of 66 passed (41 per cent), as com- pared with 66 per cent in the previous year. These results may be regarded as satisfactory except in the case of Part II of the Final Examination, in which the failures in midwifery were absolutely and relatively high, being 25 out of 42 candidates, or approximately 60 per. cent. This matter is receiving attention. 5. There was a decrease, as compared with last year, of Rs. 1,020-7-6 in the receipts (Rs. 6,488-11-6) which is largely due to a decrease in the tuition fees in consequence of the smaller number of private students. On the other hand, the expenditure showed a reduction of Rs. 9,422-15-6 which was mainly due to the reduced cost of stipends and of allowances to Lecturers. The total expenditure was Rs. 61,201 (in round figure) as compared with Rs. 70,624 in 1932-33 and Rs. 87,483 in 1931-32. The question of reducing the large gap between receipts and expenditure was examined during the year, and, as a temporary measure, it has been decided to discontinue, with effect from the commence- ment of the next session, the grant of stipends and to enhance the tuition and other fees. 6.

RESOLUTION ON THE Report on the Working of the Burma Government Medical School, Rangoon. For the Year 1935MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.( 2 ) factor since many of the staff of the school are employed not only in the hospital but also in the Medical College. Furthermore, the Rangoon General Hospital serves as a practical teaching institution for both the College and the School. Also some members of the staff of the School are performing duties outside the School, the Hospital and the College. It will thus be seen that in Burma to assess or to calculate the cost per student of the school to any appreciable degree of accuracy will not be possible. Calculations have therefore perforce been made in this year's report on the same basis as last year.

In this connection it may be noted here that in the past the expenditure statement of the Annual Report used to understate the expenditure by omitting the salary of officers such as Assistant Lecturers, Hostel Master and two Sub-Assistant Surgeon demonstrators. It has been rectified in this statement which shows the actual expenditure during 1939-40. The statement shows under " Receipt " an increase which is due to increased tuition fees received. Decrease under " Expenditure " is mainly due to decrease in expenditure under contingencies. The proposal for the transfer of the Burma Government Medical School from Rangoon to Mandalay is still under consideration of Government. Lieut.-Colonel R. C. Phelps, M.B. (Toronto) I.M.S., was Superin- tendent of the School till 11th May 1939 (A.M.), when he was relieved by Lieut.-Colonel A. Ba Thaw, M.B., Ch.B.,I.M.S. The latter continued as Superintendent of the school till the end of the year under review. U Po Saw, M.B.B.S. (Rgn.), was the Hostel Master of the School throughout the year. My thanks are due to Lieut.-Colonel Phelps, I.M.S., Lieut.-Colonel A. Ba Thaw, and Dr. U Po Saw and also to other members of the staff of the school for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties during the year under report. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, R. H. CANDY, Colonel, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Burma.
