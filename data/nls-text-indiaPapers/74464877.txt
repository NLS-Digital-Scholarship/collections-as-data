REPORT ON PLAGUE IN THE PUNJAB FROM OCTOBER 1ST, 1901, TO SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1902. This report deals with the fifth season of plague in the Punjab,  i.e., from October 1st,   1901, to September 30th, 1902. A brief review of the epidemic as a whole will first be given, after which the out- breaks in each British district and in Native States will be separately described. The description of the outbreaks in most British districts has been compiled from the reports submitted by Deputy Commissioners and Plague Medical Officers; subjects are thus dealt with both from the administrative and medical points of view. Separate reports by Civil and Medical Officers were not received from Native States : in most instances reports were submitted by Medical Officers. As the epidemic under report is the first that has run its entire course, under conditions which left the decision as to the measures they would adopt for their protection almost entirely to the people themselves, it has been considered advisable to describe as fully as possible, without going into too minute detail, the outbreak in each district or State, and to give the opinions and recommendations ex- pressed by Civil and Medical Officers, with regard to measures for dealing with plague as the result of their own experience. 2. During this year 267,581 cases of plague, with 174, 041 deaths, were reported in the British districts of the Punjab, and 51,352 cases, with 46,348 deaths, in the Native States, the total for the Province being 318,933 cases and 220,389 deaths. The epidemic was the most severe and widespread that has hitherto occurred in the Punjab, both cases and deaths exceeded by more than 20 times those of all the four previous outbreaks put together. Outbreaks occurred in 16 British districts and 8 Native States, while, except for a few imported cases, the disease had been previously limited to 8 British districts and 2 Native States. These particulars will be better appreciated by a reference to the table (No. 1) which is given on the opposite page, and to the two maps preceding it. In the table are shown the number of plague cases and deaths which have been reported in the British districts and Native States of the Punjab from the first appearance of the disease in October 1897 to the end of September 1902. It will be seen that in these five years the province has lost 2,29,621 of its inhabi- tants from plague alone. Of the two maps just referred to, one shows the distribution of plague in the Punjab from October 1897 to the end of September 1901, the other during the year under report. In these maps infected areas and places are hatched in red, those in which only imported cases of plague occurred are hatched in black.. Review of the epidemic, 3.    The epidemic of 1900-01, although  it  died  down   during   the hot   weather, did not entirely  disappear, and  there  was  no period of   complete  freedom  from   plague,  as there had been towards the end of the hot weather in previous years. October 1901.On October 1st, 1901, 4 districts-Jullundur, Hoshiarpur, Gurds- pur and Silkot-were already infected, and by the end of the month plague had broken out in the Shahpur and Ludhina Districts, and in the Native States of Patila and Kapurthala. In these 6 British districts and 2 Native States 3,393 plague cases and 1,448 deaths occurred during the month.
?2 November 1901.-During November plague increased in the districts and States already infected, and the Lahore District was also declared infected. The number of infected districts and States, with the number of plague cases and deaths, during the month and from the commencement of the year under report are shown below :- Infected Districts.

January 1902.-In January 1902 plague increased in all districts and States previously infected, and epidemics commenced in the Ferozepore District and in the Native States of Kalsia and Mler Kotla. The City of Lahore also became infected during the month. Infected Districts. Infected Native States. DURING JANUARY 1902. FROM OCTOBER 1ST, 1901, TO JANUARY 31ST, 1902.   Cases. Deaths. Cases.

?3 February 1902.-Plague continued to increase during February 1902 and outbreaks occurred in the Gujrnwla District and in Bahwalpur and Jnd States. Imported cases also occurred in the towns of Delhi, Amritsar and Karnl. Infected Districts. Infected Native  States. DURING FEBRUARY 1902. FROM OCTOBER 1ST, 1901,  TO FREBRUARY 28TH, 1902.   Cases.

Plague increased greatly in all infected British districts and Native States, except the Bahwalpur State, in which there was a slight decline. The Amritsar, Gujrt, Jhang and Mooltan Districts and the Native State of Nlgarh became infected, and imported cases of plague occurred in the towns of Delhi, Karnl, Kaithal, Nrpur and Bhiwni. As will be seen from the abstract table below no less than 68,434 persons died in the Punjab during this month from plague alone :- Infected Districts. Infected Native States. DURING MARCH 1902.

The Karnl District, which had hitherto escaped with imported cases, at last became infected ; but the outbreak in the Bahwalpur State came to an end. Imported cases occurred in the Jhelum, Rwalpindi and Montgomery Districts and the Native State of Bhagt. Infected Districts. Infected Native States. DURING APRIL 1902.

?4 May 1902.-There was a marked fall in the number of plague cases and deaths in May, and, except for an imported case at the Sadr, the Shahpur District was free of the disease. Imported cases occurred in the towns of Jhelum and Dera Ghzi Khan and in the Bhakkar and Leiah Tahsls of the Minwri District. Infected Districts. Infected Native States. DURING MAY 1902.

The Ludhina District suffered most severely : there were outbreaks of plague in 665 of the 869 villages of the district, and nearly 50,000 persons, rather over 7 per cent. of its population, died of plague alone. Silkot came next, with over 900 infected villages and 34,000 deaths from plague ; after these the Ambala, Jullundur, Gurdspur and Hoshirpur Districts were most severely affected in the order named. Bearing of the people in the presence of plague. In- fluence of the epidemic upon agriculture, trade, etc. 5. The people of the Punjab have a reputation for sturdy independence, which was fully supported by the bearing of the inhabitants of districts infected with plague during the year under report. Even in districts which suffered most severely from the ravages of plague, the people were not easily aroused from their fatalistic attitude. In most places the disease was looked upon as a visitation of Providence, to which human resistance was considered to be use- less, and in some cases-especially by Muhammadans-as impious. An increased devotion to religious exercises was observed among some communities, and in many instances villages trusted to the charms and incantations of their spiritual advisers in preference to the counsel of Government officials, often with disastrous results to themselves. In only a few instances did anything of the nature of a panic occur, and only among Hinds. The contrast between Hinds and Muhammadans in this respect has been noticed by several district officers, it having been mentioned that while the Hinds in some in- stances fled, leaving their sick unattended and their dead to be disposed of by others, the Muhammadans prided themselves on their devotion to their plague-stricken brethren, and made it a point of honour to attend the funerals of those who died of plague. Agriculture. In no district did the epidemic cause any noticeable interference with agricultural operations, though, in some instances in which entire households had been swept away by plague, or only orphan children survived, fields would have been left untilled and crops unreaped but for the kindly help of friends and neighbours. Trade. In some places in which outbreaks of plague were severe and led to the flight of a considerable population of the trading com- munity, trade was temporarily disorganised, but only for a short time. Litigation. Litigation in some districts was in abeyance or greatly diminished during the height of the epidemic, this being due in many in- stances to one or both parties of suits having succumbed to plague.
?6 Crime. While plague had the effect of   diminishing litigation an  increase  of crime was re- ported in many badly-infected   districts.    This increase was chiefly due to   thefts   of  property lying unprotected in evacuated houses, and as these thefts were   often  not  discovered   for considerable periods, the crimes frequently escaped detection. Attitude of the people towards plague measures. 6.    The attitude of the people towards plague measures, though it  differed   slightly in different districts   and  at different periods of  the  epidemic,  may best be described  by saying that those measures were most adopted which involved the least amount of official interference, and that as a rule none were resorted to until forced upon the people by bitter experience. As no official compulsion was used there were no conflicts between officials and the people, though the latter often regarded the former with suspicion, declaring that the measures, such as disinfection or inoculation, were but means of spreading plague in order to get rid of the surplus population. Such measures as were adopted by the people themselves-as for example, evacuation, or arrangements for preventing the access of strangers to villages-were but rarely carried out thoroughly and consequently were often without much benefit. Climate, soil and water-supply. 7.    A reference to the second of the maps prefixed to this report will show that almost the whole   of the   Province   east   of   the   river Jhelum and   south of the Himalayas was infect- ed with plague, with the exception of the most southernly portion bordering for the most part on the Bikaner desert. The climate of the whole of this area is very similar, but the soil and water-supply vary considerably in different districts and in different parts of the same district. '1 hose districts which have been referred to as having suffered most severely are all included in the submontane area. the water-supply of which is good, and the soil pro- ductive. Next to the submontane districts the Lahore and Ferozepore Districts were most badly affected, and in these districts, although the natural water-supply is not so good, there is a large amount of irrigated land. References will be found in subsequent portions of this report to variations in the severity of the outbreaks in different parts of certain dis- trict, for example, to the comparative immunity from plague of that part of the Ambala District situated in the foot-hills and of a part of the Sialkot District in which the water was at a depth from the surface. It is there pointed out that the difference is probably due more to the diminished density of the population, resulting in the one area from the inferior quality of the soil, and in the other from the scarcity of water than to these conditions themselves. It would seem most probable that this conclusion applies to the Punjab as a whole ; for, though in cer- tain districts with a dense population, as for instance the Amritsar District, the outbreaks of plague were comparatively small, yet the statement in the main holds good, that those areas suffered most from plague the population of which was densest, and this not merely because there were more persons to fall victims to the disease, but because in areas in which the distances between villages were generally less than a mile, there was much greater inter-communication than in areas in which-as in parts of the Ambala District-the villages consisted of a few huts scattered on the hillsides remote from other hamlets, or in which-as in parts of the Sialkot District-a visit from one village to its neighbour involved a journey of 5 or 10 miles. Measures tak'n with a view to prevent  outbreaks of plague in infected places. 8.    Surveillance over new arrivals from infected places was but sparingly  exercised except in Simla, where special arrangements existed. In many districts the villagers availed themselves of the  power  of  refusing access to persons from   infected  places,  sometimes with  success, though in most instances their efforts were rendered futile owing to the absence of concerted action. Arrangements for obtaining information. 9. Arrangements for obtaining information.    The arrangements for obtaining information were much the same throughout the Province.    Lambardars   and    Chaukidars   re- ported plague  occurrences   to   Patwaris   who recorded them and furnished returns,    in   some districts  to  Civil,   and, in   others,   to   the Medical authorities. In no district was it possible to exercise a sufficient check over the returns ; indeed, in most districts no attempt was made to do so. On the whole, however, District Officers were satisfied that the returns submitted indicated very fairly the number of deaths from plague. In many districts a tendency to conceal plague cases at the commencement of outbreaks was noticed. this changing later to a disposition to report all deaths as having been due to plague. The effect of these circumstances on the value of the returns is noticed in the reports on the districts concerned. Evacuation. 10.    The value of evacuation of infected houses and villages as a measure of checking outbreaks of plague is well recognised by the people of the Punjab, and  was   the   measure most commonly resorted to by the inhabitants of infected villages.
?7 Extent to which observed. In nearly every infected district it was resorted   to   more   or less.    It  has  already been    mentioned    that   evacuation    was   but rarely   carried   out    thoroughly.    In   only    a few instances did the entire population of villages go into camp, and in still fewer did the people take their belongings into camp with them and refrain from visiting their houses. Difficulties. District Officers have pointed out  in   explanation   of  the failure  of the   people   to avail themselve fully of a measure, the value of which they understood, and which involved no official interference, that during the cold weather evacuation of their houses entails real hardship upon the poorer classes, and that the difficulty of making suitable shelter not only for themselves but for their cattle is often insurmountable. At all seasons, too. persons who leave their houses have to choose between the difficulty of taking all their belongings into camp with them, and the danger of leaving them at the mercy of thieves. This danger is greater in partially evacuated villages and naturally affects most seriously those whose possessions are greatest. Effects. Imperfect as it was, however, evacuation appears to have been of considerable bene- fit,     the    benefit     varying    in    proportion   to the thoroughness with which  this   measure was carried out. It is recorded that in some villages in badly-infected districts outbreaks of plague were averted by the prompt evacuation on the discovery that rats were dying of plague, the same is said of individual households. Employment of cordons and guards. 11.    In very few instances the villagers placed cordons around evacuated villages to prevent   the  return   of   persons   from   camp, and also to protect property left in the villages. The placing of guards over evacuated houses was more commonly observed than the measure just referred to, but even this was not common. The measure most commonly adopted for the protection of property left in villages was that of leaving a member of each family- generally an old man-in the house. Segregation. 12.    In only very rare instances were any arrangements made for   the   segregation of plague patients or contacts. The occasions on which this measure was resorted to were almost completely limited to them in which persons suffering from plague arrived at uninfected places. The prompt segregation of such persons and their attendants undoubtedly prevented out- breaks of plague in certain places. The extent to which people accepted medical treat- ment. 13.    The extent to which people accepted European medical treatment was so small as to be negligible. With very few exceptions plague patients and their friends preferred the treatment of Hakims   and   Vaids,   though in a few places in which Medical Officers were well known  to  the people and had obtained their confidence their advice and treatment were sought for and appreciated. Disinfection by official agency. 14.    Although in districts which have suffered severely from plague the advantage of disinfecting infected   houses   and effects is be- ginning to   be  appreciated by the people, the trouble involved by even the simplest method of disinfection has very greatly inter- fered with its adoption. This was especially the case with disinfection by official agency. Chemical disinfection of houses was but sparingly resorted to in any district. and very few villages were completely disinfected by chemical means. The measure is not a popular one as it involves serious interference with the domestic privacy of the people owing to the invasion of their houses by disinfecting gangs, besides putting them to the inconvenience of removing all the property from the houses. It was therefore in but comparatively few instances that the conditions prevailed under which chemical disinfec- tion was likely to be effective, and under which by the orders of Government it was only to be carried out. It may be remarked that even had the attitude of the people towards chemical disinfection been the opposite to what it was, it would probably have been beyond the resources of Government to disinfect chemically every house in which a case of plague occurred. In Statement No. 10 (Appendix C) are shown such details regarding the number of villages and houses disinfected and the expenditure incurred in connection therewith as were given in the reports of Plague Medical Officers.    It will be seen that 148 villages were
8 completely and 116 partially disinfected. In addition to this a number of bouses and rooms were also disinfected. The expenditure on this measure, as shewn in the statement, amounted to Rs. 62,058 ; including the districts of which particulars are not given it probably amounted to about Rs. 63,000. It should be noted, however, that the expenditure in some districts was incurred in the purchase of stocks of disinfectants of which but little was used. The cost per house of chemical disinfection varied in different districts, and, on account of the circumstance just mentioned, it cannot be computed with any accuracy from the figures given in the statement. The chemical disinfection of personal effects was even more unpopular than that of houses, and was accordingly less resorted to. The results of chemical disinfection varied in different districts, this variation corresponding in most instances with the degree of thoroughness with which it was carried out, and with the extent to which it was accompanied by other measures, such as evacua- tion. Of some towns, it is said, that no further cases of plague occurred in houses after chemical disinfection ; while of others it is reported that houses had to be disinfected two or three times. Disinfection by official agency was carried out in accordance with the provisions of memorandum on disinfection. The coloured 1 in 1,000 solution of perchloride of mercury was used in all districts, except Amritsar, for the disinfection of houses. Phenyle of a strength of 1 in too was used for the disinfection of clothing and other personal effects.    This disinfectant was also used in the Amritsar district for houses. Popular methods of disinfection. 15.    When the people refused disinfection by official agency they sometimes adopted measures of their own.    These methods includ- ed the making of holes in the roofs of   houses, lighting fires on the floor, fumigating with sulphur, camphor or neem leaves, white- washing or " leeping" the walls of infected rooms and exposing infected clothing and other articles to air and sunshine. Although the opportunities of estimating the value of popular methods of disin- fection were but few, it is believed by District Officers that these methods were not without benefit. Desiccation. A stove invented and patented by Dr. Bhagat Rm, Sawhney of Jammu and used by him during the epidemic  of   plague   there   for desiccating infected houses was used in a   few towns:  most of these   stoves   were   the  property   of   private   individuals. Steam disinfectors. 16.    The only steam disinfectors used in connection with plague in the Punjab were a " Thresh Disinfector "     of the fixed type, and a portable  " Equifix Disinfector." The former of these was used at the inspection posts at Klka and Tra Devi. The latter was first employed at Ambala City where it was much appreciated: it was afterwards transferred to the Tawi Inspection Post Investigations were made during the year under report to deter- mine which of the many patterns of steam disinfectors was most suitable for use in towns and inspection posts in the Punjab. As the result of these enquiries ten ' Bowman " dis- infectors were ordered from Messrs. Richardson and Cruddas of Bombay; but none were delivered until after the end of September 1902. Disinfection Dept, 17.    In accordance with the orders contained in Punjab Government letter No. 333 dated 28th February   1902, a Central Disinfec- tion Dept was  established   at  Jullundur   City for the testing and supply of chemical disinfectants, the preparation of concentrated solution of perchloride of mercury and the supply of these articles and of disinfecting appliances to Plague Medical Officers and others. The Central Disinfecting Dept was opened in September 1902, but as early as April 1902 supplies were issued from it. Full reports concerning the Dept have been submitted separately. Inoculation. 18.    The   number of anti-plague   inoculations   performed in the  Punjab   during the year under report was 318,565.     Details of the number   of   inoculations   performed   in   each tahsil are given in Statement No. 1 (Appendix A). The number performed in each month and by each Medical Officer is shown respectively in Statements Nos. 6 and 8 (Appendix B). The number of persons of different races or castes inoculated during the year is shown in Statement No. 7 (Appendix B). A reference to Statement No. 1 (Appendix A) will show that inoculation was most resorted to in districts which suffered most from plague, only about 6,100 persons having been inoculated in districts in which outbreaks were comparatively slight,
?9 A comparison of Statements 2 (Appendix A) and 6 (Appendix B) will show further that the demand for inoculation increased and diminished part passu with the rise and fall of plague. It will be noticed that over 24,000 inoculations were performed in September 1902. The majority of these inoculations were performed in the Ambala and Ferozepore Districts in connection with the scheme for extensive inoculation operations during the plague season of 1902-03. Comparison with previous years. The number of inoculations performed in  the Punjab during each year from October 1st,   1897, to September 30th, 1902, is  shewn below:- October 1st, 1897, to September 30th,  1898 3,918 ,, 1898 ,, 1899 9,184 ,, 1899 ,, 1900 293,628 ,, 1900 ,, 1901 197,278 ,, 1901 ,, 1902 *318,565   Total  822,573 It will be seen that the number of inoculations performed in British Districts during the year under report exceeds that of any previous year, except 1899-1900. In that year very- special efforts were made to induce most of the population of the Nawashahr and Garh- shankar Tahsils of the Jullundur and Hoshiarpur Districts to be inoculated. During the year under report, however, although facilities were afforded as far as possible for the in- oculation of such as desired the operation, no special efforts were made to induce the people to be inoculated, except in September, to which reference has already been made. The figures for the year indicate therefore the spontaneous demand for inoculation on the part of the people. If anything, an estimation of the demand for inoculation based upon these figures would be rather below than above the mark ; for, as will be seen later, the Medical Officers in certain districts were unable to meet the rush for inoculation which occurred when plague was raging. Attitude of the people towards inoculation. 19.    The attitude of the  people towards  inoculation in  certain   districts  will  be evident  from  what   has   just   been reported. Speaking generally, it may be said that before plague began to spread widely and after its decline, the demand for inoculation was small in all districts, and it was only great in those districts which suffered severely from plague. Until the people became familiar with inoculation all sorts of objections were- raised against it, and the most absurd rumours prevailed as to its evil effects. Some of the objections were reasonable enough, such, for instance, as the discomfort produced by inoculation during the hot weather, or as the inability of the very poor to afford the two or three days' enforced idleness following the operation. The rumours as to the ill effects of inoculation, which ranged from sudden death to impotency, had no foundation in fact and would seem to have been the outcome of thoughtlessness or malice. No objections were raised on religious grounds to inoculation per se, though it was, of course, objected to by those persons already referred to, who regarded all attempts to protect themselves from a heaven-sent pestilence as impious. Muhammadans as a rule resorted less freely to inoculation than did Hindus ; this being partly due to their more fatalistic ideas and partly to the objection of certain classes to permit their women to be inoculated by men, though it will appear from that section of the report which deals with the Ambala District that in one instance when arrangements were made for a Lady Doctor to inoculate purdah women, the women preferred to be inoculated by the Medical Officer of the district. Methods adopted for inducing its acceptance. 20.    Except in   September 1902, no  special   measures  were taken   to   induce   the people to accept inoculation.    The benefits of the measure were of course explained   to   the people by District Officers, but no inducements were held out and no pressure was exer- cised in order to promote its acceptance, and, as before stated, the inoculations performed were carried out   in response to the   popular demand. Arrangements for carrying out inoculation. 21.    But brief reference is here necessary to the arrangements made  for  carrying out inoculations ; these varied in different dis- tricts and with   the demand for the operation. In most badly-infected districts Medical Officers toured among plague-stricken villages, in some visiting each village that asked for inoculation, and in others halting at places to which the people of neighbouring villages came for inoculation. * NOTE.- British Districts 235,776 318,565  Native States                82,789
?10 Method of its performance. Records. 22.   The method of performing the operation calls for no  description  here.    The records concerning inoculation were similar to those described in the reports on inoculation for 1899-1900. though it should be stated that (c)wing partly to the relative weakness of the staff and partly to the conditions which have been referred to in dealing with the leading information, it is not possible to attain or maintain as  complete records concerning inoculation as in former years. Effects of inoculation. 23.    From what has  been stated above it  will be  evident that  the statistical   evi- dence of the  value  of  inoculation during the year under report is very incomplete. In only very few instances were data obtainable for comparing the incidence of out- breaks of plague upon inoculated or uninoculated communities living under otherwise similar conditions. A comparison based upon the total figure of the Province would be of no value, because on the one hand in some districts only isolated cases of plague occurred among large populations, and in the others a large number of inoculations were performed after outbreaks of plague had ceased. Such data as were obtained are dealt with in the reports of the districts concerned, but it may be said here that in nearly every instance inoculated communities suffered much less severely from plague than the unin- oculated. The number of attacks and deaths among inoculated persons are shown in State- ments 1 (Appendix A) and 9 (Appendix B) in the latter of which the number and fatality of attacks at varying periods after inoculation are shown. In Statement No. I it is shown that of the 235,776 persons inoculated in the British districts, 881 were attacked with plague, of whom 309 died. The figures are included in those of the total number of cases and deaths from which they must be deducted to show the number of cases and deaths among uninoculated persons. These amounted to 266,700 and 173,732 respectively. The fatality of attack among the uninoculated was 65.14 and among the inoculated 35.07. Attention may be drawn here to the remarks made by several officers that although plague occurrences among uninoculated persons may have been concealed, the people promptly brought to light all such occurrences among the inoculated. However doubtful therefore the value of the statistics concerning plague occurrences may be, there seems little room for doubting that the figures showing the fatality of attacks among the inoculated are fairly correct, and unless it be held that the number of unreported cases of plague among the uninoculated was so great as to materially reduce the figure showing the fatality of attacks among this class, that the inoculated persons who were attacked with plague had nearly twice as great a chance of recovery than the uninoculated. Should it be held that a very large number of cases among uninoculated persons were concealed, the comparison of the incidence of plague attacks among uninoculated and inoculated becomes more unfavourable to the former. In Statement No. 9 (Appendix B) the 881 cases of plague among inoculated persons are shown according to the period which elapsed between inoculation and attack. The figures shown for each period in different districts are often too small to be of much value, but when grouped are sufficiently large to permit of comparison being made between them. It will be seen that though the figures for different districts vary considerably, the fatality of attacks among the inoculated is much less at all periods except during the first week after inoculation than among the uninoculated in every district, and that taking the figures for all districts together attacks even during the first week after inoculation were slightly less fatal than attacks among uninoculated persons. It would appear from the statement that the protective value of inoculation against death from plague increases up to three months and then declines, though even after four months the inoculated are better off than the uninoculated. Infection. Manner in which  the  infection of  plague is con- veyed. Human agency. 24.    All officers, Civil and Medical, were convinced that plague is almost invariably conveyed from one place to another by human intercourse, either directly by persons suffer- ing from the disease or indirectly in infected clothing and bedding or other personal effects. Rats. The only other possible carrier  of infection mentioned in the district reports is the rat, and the instances  in  which  it  appeared more probable that villages had been infected by rats than that the disease had been introduced by human agency were very few. The statements made in the reports of most badly-infected districts that in many villages rats died before any human beings were attacked cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that infection was introduced by rats because it has to be considered along with the equally prevalent statements in the reports of district officers that the earlier cases of outbreak were usually concealed. From the facts recorded in certain reports of the migration of rats from infected to uninfected villages, there can, however, be little doubt that these animals do occasion- ally introduce the infection of plague into previously uninfected villages.
?II Merchandise. No undoubted instances of the conveyance of infection in grain or merchandise were recorded during the year. Recrudescence. With regard to the reappearance of plague in villages as opposed to the reintroduc- tion of   infection    very   little  is  said  in   the reports.    That the   virus of   plague  can   and does lie dormant during the hot weather months and that it regains its activity with the approach of the cold weather, experience in the Punjab renders it almost impossible to doubt. Where or in what condition the virus exists during its stage of lessened activity and what are the conditions necessary to enable it to again attack human beings, are questions which cannot be answered at present. Dissemination of infection through infected places. That  human agency is largely responsible for the dissemination of infection within  infected  places  is  borne   out  by the district  reports though most officers agree that once a village becomes infected rats play a very important part in spreading infection from house to house and it would seem as if, in many instances, villages would have escaped with only imported cases of plague had it not been for the conveyance of infection by rats from infected houses to others, the occupants of which had no communication either direct or indirect with the occupants of previously infected houses. Contraction of plague by human beings  and other animals. No  facts  were  mentioned  by  any  Medical   Officer as having been observed with regard   to  the   manner   in   which   plague   is contracted by human beings and other animals. The extent to which rats or other animals have suffered from plague. Relation as to time between rat mortality and outbreaks of plague among human beings. 25.    The subject of mortality amongst rats in plague-stricken places has already been referred to.    In  most instances plague among  rats has apparently preceded outbreaks among human beings. As above stated, however, it is likely that the first cases of plague m  many villages were either overlooked or concealed, and that the priority of the disease among rats was often only apparent. The interval stated to have elapsed between the date when the death or sickness of rats was first noticed and the occurrence of plague among human beings varied from a few days to a month, though a week is a period very commonly mentioned. In some instances it was definitely stated that rat mortality was observed only after a strong outbreak of plague among human beings. Relation    between   extent   of   rat   mortality   and severity of outbreaks of plague among human beings. But few officers have dealt with the relation   between  the  extent of  outbreak  of plague among  rats  and   human   beings.    It is recorded   Of   some   villages   in   which    the  of outbreaks of plague among human beings.                                  outbreak   or  plague  was   very  severe   that rats also suffered greatly, but it would seem   that while  the  extent  of  outbreaks among human beings varied greatly rats were usually almost exterminated by plague. Measures for dealing with rats. In very few instances were any measures taken to get rid of rats.    Hindus objected on religious grounds to killing these animals, and   others    preferred  not   to do so,  some saying that rats were useful as a warning. Notices were issued in many districts ordering the people to avoid touching dead rats and to burn them where found, but little heed appears to have been given to this order. Plague among other animals. Besides rats, squirrels were observed to die  of  plague   in several  places ;   reports were also received  of the  death of cats and dogs from plague as   the result of   eating rats died of the disease.    Some villages attributed the deaths   of  oxen,  buffaloes,   sheep  and goats to plague. Influence of local conditions, 26.    Except as regards the seasonal nature of plague and  as regards the difference in the extent  of  outbreaks in   certain areas which have already  been  referred to,   little mention is made of the effect of local conditions upon the course and extent of the epidemic and no further remarks are here necessary upon this subject. Variations in the type and seventy of plague. 27.    Variations in the type and fatality of plague in different districts and at differ- ent seasons will be dealt with below. Type and severity of the disease. Everywhere the bubonic type of  plague  prevailed.    The  number of cases  of  the pneumonic or septic type of plague was very small.    Statement No. 5 (Appendix A) shows the number of cases and deaths reported as having been due to the bubonic, pneumonic and septic types of plague respectively. These particulars are wanting in the case of the Jullundur,  Hoshirpur, Silkot, Lahore, Ambala, Gujrnwla, Amritsar, Karnl and Jhang
?12 Districts, and the statement is thus incomplete. The figures given are probably not of very great value, for although they shew that the bubonic was in excess of other types of plague the extent of the excess as shown in this statement is probably less than actually occurred. The unreliability of the figures is further shown by the comparatively low fatality of attacks of pneumonic plague, this being only 70.34 per cent. as compared with 6882 per cent, of bubonic plague. The fatality of attack of the septic type of plague-80.37 per cent.-though higher than that of the other types is lower than is usually observed. The figures are to be most probably accounted for by the inclusion in plague returns of many cases of pneumonia and malarial fever. The cases in which bubos were reported to have occurred in the femoral and ingunal regions have been shewn together under the heading " Groin " and it was apparent from the returns that the distribution between these two portions was not recognised by the persons-Patwrs and others-by whom cases were reported. 28. The variations in the severity of plague as judged by the fatality of its attacks in different districts are shown in Table No. 2- below :- Table No. 2 showing the number of Plague Cases and Deaths in each infected district of the Punjab from October 1st, 1901, to September 30th, 1902, with the percentage fatality of attacks.

The fatality of attacks in the Ludhina District was 73.44, Gujranwla coming next with a fatality of 67 61 ; the outbreak in this district was, however, a comparatively small one. The usual fatality, if such an expression can be used of plague in the Punjab, would seem to be between 55 and 67. per cent., that for all attacks in British districts having been during the year under report 65.04.  Although the variations may have been partly due to differences in the freedom with which plague occurences were reported in different districts, there are reasons for believing that the-virulence of the disease did vary in different districts. This subject is dealt with in the reports on certain districts. 29. In Table No. 3 are shown the variations of the case mortality of plagae in each month of the year under report.

?14 Variations at different seasons. There was a steady and almost regular rise in the fatality of attacks from 42?18 per cent. in October to 68?11  per cent.  in April, then a decline, broken by a sharp rise of 73?47 per cent, in June. The apparent increased fatality of attacks in June is most probably explained by the record in this month of the deaths of persons attacked in May, the figures of cases for June being so comparatively small that the addition of a small number of deaths would make a considerable difference in the apparent percentage fatality of attacks. Variations  among  different races  or   castes    and  sexes 30.    In Statement No. 3 (Appendix A) the number of attacks and deaths among males and females of  different races and   castes are  shown for all districts except those of Ambala and Lahore, particulars concerning these two districts not having been supplied by the officers concerned. No case of plague occurred among Europeans in the British districts of the Punjab during the year under report, but a European male was attacked in the Patila State and recovered. From the particulars given in. Statement No. 3. (Appendix A) a table No. 4 below has been prepared showing the totals under the different heads and certain calculations based. upon them. Excluding Native Christians, the figures for which are so small as to be easily Susceptible of error, it will be seen that the classes that suffered most from plague-as judged by the fatality of attacks-were high caste Hindus, Brahmins, Rjpts and Khatrs being included in the term, among whom the percentage fatality of attacks of plague was 70'27. Muhammadans suffered rather more than " Other Hinds", i.e., mostly Jts, agricul- turists, the fatality of attacks among these two classes having been respectively 64'04 and 62 43 per cent. Mahammadans suffered rather less than all Hinds taken, the case mort- ality among which was 66'33 per cent. It may be pointed out that the fatality among Muhammadans   was very  nearly   the same as among Chamrs and sweepers, all being meat-eating classes. In all the above classes women were more liable to attacks of plague than men, though in the case of high caste Hinds the extra liability is very slight, and it will be noticed that among this class the fatality of attacks was greater among males than among females contrasting in this respect with other classes of Hinds. This difference is probably to be accounted for by the sedentary and in-door lives which many of this class-such as shop-keepers-share with the women ; while the males of other classes of Hinds being mostly agriculturists live out-door lives, their women folk staying at home. Muhammadan females suffered considerably more than males, both as regards their liability to attack and death, more so than in the case of any other class, for which the seclusion under which they live is most probably responsible. Among Chamrs and sweepers although females  were more  liable   to attacks   than males, the fatality of attacks among them was less. As far as they go, the figures for Native Christians show not only that the fatality of attacks among females was less than among males, but that the former were less liable to attacks of plague.

?16 Variation at different age periods 31. The number of plague attacks and deaths at different age periods is shewn in Statement No. 4 (Appendix A). This state- ment also lacks details concerning the Lahore and Ambala Districts. The total figures for each age period with percentage calculations upon them are shown in Table No. 5. It will be seen that at ages between 20 and 50 the fatality of attacks is lowest- being 61.08 per cent.-and that it increases regularly in both directions : 80.39 Per cent  .of attacks among infants, and 76.31 per cent. of attacks among persons over 60 being fatal.

It should be stated that the European Medical Practitioners who arrived in September in connection with the inoculation operations of the following year are not included in the statement, but Civil Surgeons and Assistant Surgeons who performed the duties of Plague Medical Officers in addition to their own.

?17 Captain E. Wilkinson, I. M. S., was appointed as Chief Plague Medical Officer with effect from March 20th, 1902. He had previously discharged the duties of this office in addition to those of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner and continued to do so until July 1st, when he was relieved of the latter duties by Lieutenant W.F.Harvey, I. M. S. From July 9th to October 6th, 1902, he officiated as Sanitary Commissioner. Financial.   33. In statement No.12 (Appendix E) is shown the direct expenditure on plague operations in certain districts of the Punjab :  details of certain districts including Lahore and Ludhina are not available. The figures, it should be stated, were obtained from Plague Medical Officers and Civil Surgeons and refer chiefly to expenditure in connection with  measures with which these officers were more immediately concerned.

Recommendations.                                        34. A number of recommendations and suggestions concerning plague administra- tion by various officers are given in the portions of the report which deal with dis- tricts separately, but are epitomised below. All are agreed as to undesirability of compulsory measures, though many would give large power to the people in order to enable them to take measures to protect themselves against the introduction of infection by persons coming from infected places. Some would extend the right of refusing access to such persons to the smaller municipali- ties which partake more of the nature of villages than of towns, while all are agreed as to the benefit of evacuation. Some would offer every inducement to the people of villages to resort to it by the provision of huts for the very poor-and for the cattle-and would provide guards for evacuated houses; others would leave the arrangements for evacuation entirely to the people themselves, trusting to the well-to-do to provide for the wants of the poor. Certain officers recommend th exercise of compulsory powers when but for an insignificant minority a whole village would be evacuated and one officer proposes to charge such minority for all guards over property left in evacuated villages. Nearly all officers, Civil and Medical, consider that the chemical disinfection of villages except in the very earliest stage of infection should be discontinued. The measure is unpopular and the expense is out of all proportion to the results attained. Some officers would abandon disinfection by official agency altogether even in towns, but these form a very small minority. While disapproving of chemical disinfection by official agency, most officers point out the desirability of some method of disinfection that could be applied by the people themselves Some recommend desiccation, others the free distribution of phenyle or some similar disinfectant the use of which the people understand and appreciate. Opinions regarding the value of inoculation as a means of dealing with out- break of plague are unanimous-many regarding it as the  most valuable of all such measures, and most advocate the provisions of facilities for inoculation. A few officers recommend the grant of a subsistence allowance of a few annss daily to such persons as are too poor to afford enforced idleness for a day or two following in- oculation.
?18 Delhi Division. HISSAR DISTRICT. 35. Five plague cases occurred this year in the Hissar District, of which 4 were imported and the 5th a suspicious one at Bhiwni. Every necessary precaution was taken in accordance with the existing rules to keep the patients under isolation and the houses occupied by them were duly disinfected by the Civil Surgeon. There having been only imported plague cases in the District, no special medical staff was deputed to the District for plague duty, but the Medical Officers concerned performed plague duty in addition to their ordinary one. DELHI DISTRICT. 36.    Of plague in the Delhi District during the year under report the Deputy Com- missioner and Civil Surgeon write as follows :- " There have as yet been no indigenous cases of plague in  either Delhi City  or District. " Between the months of February and. June 1902 II cases were discovered, and these were refugees from Patila, Ludhina, Ambala and Klka, 2 of whom were removed from trains. Of these 11 cases 9 resulted fatally. The houses infected were disinfected by a staff despatched under the orders of the Civil Surgeon. Disinfection (a)    " The houses in several cases were   disinfected by the Assistant Surgeon   with perchloride of mercury and in the others by the practitioners attending the sick. The people were averse to disinfection. " The friends of the sick refused to have them removed or to evacuate their houses. " All possible precautions were taken in view of the possibility of an epidemic. The city was divided into wards and sub-committees appointed for each ward, under whose orders gangs of scavengers attended to the general cleanliness of the town, includ- ing the interior of private houses where such interference was necessary. Chaudhris were selected from the various mohallas, and a net-work of supervision introduced, so that ready information might be given of all cases. Information.                             (b)    " Information concerning plague attacks and deaths was received through the ward members    and    medical    practitioners    who treated the cases. " Notices in simple language were circulated throughout the town containing advice regarding plague, and people were informed that arrangements had been made at the Civil Hospital for inoculation. This latter notice, however, met with no response, and only 4 persons were inoculated. There was a strong local feeling that the railway approaches of Delhi should be protected by inspection posts, but the proposal did not meet with the approval of Government. In view of the Darbr of next year, it is probable, however, that a further representation will be made by the Municipal Committee in this connection at the beginning of the cold weather. Types of plague.                                   (c)    " All the cases of plague were of the bubonic variety, but there were a number of very suspicious cases in Delhi in which the patients were taken ill suddenly and soon became insensible, dying in one or two days. These were in the first instance taken as cases of plague of a virulent form, but on post mortem examination made in two of the suspicious cases it was found that the cases were of cerebro-spinal fever. " No   plague  cases  were treated at the Hospital ;   they  were treated by their  own physicians. (d) " The Civil Surgeon of the District performed plague duty in addition to his ordinary duties, with one Hospital Assistant specially deputed for plague duty in the District." KARNAL DISTRICT. Review of epidemic.                                                37.    Plague broke out in the Karnl District for the first time during the year under report.    There were outbreaks of   plague in two tahs is, Thricsar and Kaithal, and some imported cases occurred in the town of Karnl.
?19 Altogether 566 cases of plague with 333 deaths occurred in the district during this year.

?20 The following account of the epidemic in the Karnl District is extracted from the  report  of Lieutenant Corry, I. M. S., the Civil Surgeon :- " The first case of plague in the District appeared in Karnl City on the 14th Feb- ruary 1902. Between this date and the 2nd April 1902 seven cases altogether were re- ported in the city, all of which ended fatally. " These cases were proved to have been imported from the Ambala District. No other cases occurred, in the Karnl Tahsl during the time this report covers. "In the Thnesar Tahsl plague was first reported on the 15th February in the town of Thnesar. Two cases occurred, both of which were imported from the Ambala District, and ended fatally. In the town of Ldwa, in this tahsil, three cases were reported on the 7th March. " These were also imported from the Ambala District, and two of them ended fatally. "In the Kaithal Tahsl one case occurred at Pehowa on the 12th March and one on the 23rd April. " Both these cases were imported from Patila State and ended fatally. " So far the cases were all imported, and the disease did not spread any further. Thnesar Tahsfl.                                    (a)    " From the 11th April to 15th May six cases of plague with three 'deaths occurr- ed in the village  of  Mohri in the Thnesar Tahsl. " These cases were not imported ones, but the disease was contracted in the villages of Mohra and Shahpur in the Ambala District, the former village being only one mile dis- tant from Mohri. Some days before the actual outbreak of the disease rats were observed to die in the village. It is hard to say whether the disease was actually first contracted in Mohra, or the village infected from Mohra as there is a great deal of inter-communication between the inhabitants of the two villages, and they lie so close together. " The outbreak ceased on May 18th, by which time 48 cases with 36 deaths had been reported. " Seven other villages were infected in this tahsl, the total number of plague cases and deaths in the tahsl during the year being respectively 228 and 132. "No disinfection of houses was carried out. Kaithal Tahsil.                                      (b)    " The first villages infected here were Mayn  and Baran, the former from 3rd April to 7th May, during which time 61 cases with 28 deaths occurred,  and the latter from 4th April to 12th May, 43 cases with 28 deaths occurring.    These villages were infected from Patila State. " On the 12th April the disease broke out in the town of Kaithal ; between this date and the 26th May 90 cases with 59 deaths occurred "There were outbreaks of plague in-five other villages, all of which received their infection from the Patila State. 331 plague cases with 194 deaths occurred in the Kaithal Tahsl during the year under report. Attitude of the people.                 (c)    " Generally speaking, the epidemic caused very little alarm amongst the people, and  all   plague measures  were  resisted  by them to a very considerable extent. preventive pleasures.               (d)    " No measures at any time were taken to prevent the outbreak of plague in unin- fected places, nor was any surveillance over arrivals from infected places resorted to ex- cept as noted below. " Only in the case of the village of Mohri did the inhabitants try to prevent persons from infected places from entering their village, and in this case they were not successful, as people were reported to have entered by night. Measures for obtaining information. (e)    " The arrangements for obtaining information regarding plague cases were very imperiect.    Cards in the vernacular containing  instructions for the reporting of cases of plague were circulated to the Tahsildrs and to the Lambardrs and Patwrs of villages. These latter sent in daily reports to the Civil Surgeon, whilst the former sent in consolidated daily reports.    In the case of Kaithal and Arnauli, where there were Hospital Assistants, reports
?21 were also sent by them, but in no case did these reports agree, nor was there sufficient medical supervision to say whether or not all the cases reported were really cases of plague.    There were no methods taken to check the plague returns received. Evacuation.                                     (f)    " Evacuation, as far as information can be obtained, was only carried out in the case of the village  of Mohri, and that imperfectly.    Even here isolation was not maintained, but communication with the village kept up.    In spite of this the measure seemed to have been effective, as no case was reported as occurring amongst those who left their houses. Guards. (g)    " In no case was a guard maintained over evacuated dwellings. Segregation.                 (h)    " In Ldwa, Thnesar and Pehowa in the case of the imported cases segregation was observed. In Karnl and Kaithal segregation   huts were built. In the case of Karnl 5 out of the 7 imported cases were removed to these when discovered. In the case of Kaithal only one person was segregated, and this proved to be not a case of plague. In no case did the people accept medical treatment. Disinfection.               (i)   " Disinfection of houses was only carried out in the town of Kaithal : 22 houses in all were disinfected and  these only after  the cessation    of   the   plague.      Disinfection of effects was carried out in the case of the 22 houses mentioned, and the effects of the imported Thnesar cases were also done ;   but these were the only attempts made in the district. "Houses were disinfected with a solution of 1 in 1,000 of mercuric chloride to which green colouring matter had been added. In the case of furniture, clothes, etc., a milky solution of phenyle was applied in the same way. " No effects of disinfection were observed, as it was not carried out on a sufficiently extensive scale to give definite results. Inoculation.                   (j)    " Only 35 people were inoculated in the district, and these consisted of a few Europeans with their servants, one Assistant Surgeon, and some of those employed at the Mission Hospital. Rumours concerning inoculation. " The feeling against inoculation in the district was widespread, the people believing that it had little or no effect in preventing the disease. Some believed that it caused impotency, some death, and others simply objected to it on account of the ' fever ' it caused. To account of the fact that Europeans did not suffer from inoculation they state that different bottles containing a different vaccine are kept for them. No means were employed to induce the people to accept inoculation. One syringe and a supply of vaccine was kept in the possession of the Civil Surgeon. " None of those inoculated contracted the disease, but there are not sufficient data to form an opinion on the beneficial effects of this measure. Here is given a table showing the number of persons inoculated monthly, and the number performed by each inoculator :- Name of Inoculator. October. November. December. January. February. March.

Methods of infection.                           (k)    " The first cases of plague in the district were simply imported ones,' the people actually  infected  with  the   disease   coming and settling in the District ; but from none of these was the disease observed to spread. Later on the disease was conveyed to the infected villages of the district by the inhabitants of these villages actually contracting plague whilst on visits to infected villages outside the district. " No facts have been ascertained regarding the dissemination of the disease through individual villages, or how human beings and animals actually were infected. Effect of local conditions.            (l)    " Local conditions such as climate, soil, water-supply, etc., were not observed to influence the epidemic in any way, as these conditions were practically similar in all the infected places. " In Kaithal more cases occurred than elsewhere in the district, but this was pro- bably due to the greater proximity of the houses and the free intercourse between indivi- duals which this entails. As regards season, the epidemic was at its height in the month of May, and practically ceased on the approach of the hot weather. Mortality among rats.                                                       (m)    " In most of the infected places rats were observed to die from 3 to 4 days before the appearance of the disease amongst human beings. " No measures with regard to rats were taken,  and no relation as to extent was observed between the outbreak amongst rats and human beings. Types of plague.                  (n)    " There are no data as to the proportion of bubonic to the other forms  of  the disease.    The disease was equally severe at all periods of the epidemic,  and no special class seemed to be more liable or immune than another. " No treatment was employed, as it was refused by the people." Recommendations.                  (0)    Neither the Deputy Commissioner nor the Civil Surgeon  make any suggestions regarding future plague policy. Reo ommendations. The Civil Surgeon of the district did plague duty in addition to his ordinary  duties, with one temporary Hospital Assistant specially detailed for plague duty in the district. AMBALA DISTRICT. Review of epidemic.                38.    The Ambala District was visited by a very severe epidemic of plague during the year 1901-02.    Plague first broke out in Manchi, a village of 600 inhabitants in the south of  the Rpar Tahsl, on November 17th, 1901. The disease spread rapidly, and by the end of April 1902, 185 villages out of a total of 359 in this tahsil had been attacked. The epidemic in the tahsil ceased in June by end of which month 185 villages had been infected and 12,422 cases with 9,349 deaths from plague had occurred. The Kharar Tahsil was infected on December 14th, an outbreak of plague having been discovered at the village of Basin on December nth. This village served as a focus whence infection spread widely and rapidly ; in a short time 132 of the 371 villages of the tahsil were infected with plague. Except for 10 cases in July and 6 in August, the epidemic in the Kharar Tahsil ceased in June. A recrudescence occurred in September, when 52 cases with 31 deaths were reported. During the year 9,841 plague cases with 7,859 deaths occurred in this tahsil. The first infection of the Ambala Tahsil occurred on December 24th, 10,02, when a case of plague was discovered in the Ambala Cantonment. Before the end of the epidemic 71 villages out of a total of 296 were attacked in the tahsil. The outbreak ceased in June. The town of Garhi in the Nringarh Tahsl became infected in February, and the disease spread to 11 villages in the neighbourhood. Infection was carried to the town of Jagdhri at the end of March, but the outbreak of plague there was a mild one, and the disease spread to only one village in the neighbour- hood. Mr. Maynard, the Deputy Commissioner, writes:- " Half the district (the Rpar and Kharar and half of the Ambala Tahsils) was seriously involved : all the towns of any importance except Sadhaura were attacked : and infection extended from the north-west to the extreme south-east and into some villages of the Naringarh Tahsl."
?23 Owing to conditions which will be presently referred to, it is not possible to give a table showing the weekly progress of the epidemic in the Ambala District. The monthly progress of the disease will be found in Statement No. 2, Appendix A. It will be seen that the epidemic reached its highest point during March, when 13,027 cases of plague and 10,011 deaths occurred. These figures are largely in excess of those of any other month, and nearly half the mortality of the epidemic occurred during this month. There was a very rapid decline in the number of plague cases in May, and, though the district was never quite free from the disease, the cases and deaths in July and August were very few.    In September, however, a considerable rise occurred. (a) Of the course of the epidemic in different parts of the district, Mr. Maynard writes :- " In the Kharar and Rpar Tahsls the disease spread like a flood in February and reached its height in March, and the mortality dropped by 57 per cent in April In Ambala the spread did not begin till March, and the figures for April nearlv doubled those of the former month ; and in May they were more than double those of the Kharar and Rpar Tahsls combined Yet the Ambala Cantonment became infected only about a week later than the first village in Kharar." The outbreaks of plague in some towns and villages were very severe. At Basin, a village of 263 inhabitants, 74 persons were attacked with plague and 64 died-nearly a quarter of the population being carried off. The village of Chni Kaln lost 22 per cent, of its population of about 1,700 in 21/2 months, and the destruction of one-fifth or one-sixth of the population of villages was not uncommon. The towns of Rpar, Kharar and Bibil lost about 9 per cent, of their population from plague, and Karauli, a small town with a population of 3775, lost 700 of its inhabitants. In the town of Klka, however, although the outbreak commenced in February and did not cease until June, only 73 cases of plague occurred. Bearing and attitude of the people.     (b)    Of the bearing of the people in the pre- sence of the epidemic Mr. Maynard writes : - " When  an   outbreak is  apprehended there  are  signs   of    religious    revival.     A Granthi is installed under a canopy  or  in  the Bearing in the presence of the epidemic. village  rest-house  to  recite   the    Scriptures : " Havan " is freely practised ; public prayers are offered in the village mosque ; hard work is done on the excavation of the tank ; the poor of the neighbourhood are collected and fed. The lower deities or demons are also not forgotten ; fakirs are summoned and highly fed for the performance of charms ; the village site is surrounded with a circle of stakes, with demons' heads roughly carved on top to serve as supernatural guardians. " Panic appeared in some places, but the only wholesale exodus took place from the Ambala Cantonment. The Sadr Bazr being closed and trade temporarily at a stand- still, the cantonment natives (most of whom have their permanent homes elsewhere) went away to await better times. One or two prominent individuals elsewhere disgraced themselves by flight, and there was a general tendency for those who had relatives in uninfected places, and no special business to detain them to seek refuge elsewhere. " Muhammadans rarely, if ever, neglected their sick or feared to perform the funeral rites of the dead. The same uniform courage was not shown by Hinds. The sick were sometimes deserted. The Sirhind Canal was the last rest of many of the dead ; and it was not uncommon for the plague officers to come across corpses as they, rode from one centre of sickness to another. " Amid this terror and forgetfulness of natural ties, a noble piety was shown by certain Hindu volunteers who took it upon themselves to burn or bury the neglected dead.  One of these men said to me : ' My brethren may cut me off from huqqa and water, I shall not be cut off from God.' A prominent Hindu pleader at Ambala broke his arm when helping to carry the body of an unknown woman to the burning ght. In some places however it was necessary to pay high wages (in one instance as much as seven rupees to four men) to those who removed the dead." Attitude towards plague measures.      The attitude of the people towards  plague  measures  was  at  first  chiefly  one  of suspicion,    though  this   diminished   with   the spread of the disease.    The attitude  of   differ- ent classes, however, varied. Of the Sikhs, Mr. Maynard writes :-" They seem to have had an instinctive appreciation of the good intentions of Government which other people lacked "; while of other classes he says :" Rajpts devoted to purdah continued unyielding for the most part. Brahmans were generally hopeless, having (as a Jt explained) a special kind of jealous pride which forbids their taking advice, and nearly half of the Brahman community
?24 in the little town of Karauli was wiped out in consequence. The market gardening classes, Ml's, Sains, Kambohs, Rains and the like, whose hard and sordid lives on tiny holdings seems to stunt the faculties, preferred to take their own way in many instances Soldiers on pension, or on leave from their regiments, not infrequently exerted a malign influence." The attitude of leading men also varied. ' None offered opposition, many were apathetic and few helped heartily. Some set a good example without being able to induce others to follow it. This Mr. Maynard remarks was partly due to the suspicion of the poorer classes that the principal men were trying to curry favour with the authorities, though as a matter of fact they were influenced by a more vivid realization of the danger. Mr. Maynard adds that " The .semi-Europeanised and educated classes were uniformly reasonable. Some most valuable assistance was given by the pleaders of Ambala City, and a member of the same class did a good deal to popularize inoculation in the town of Rpar." (c) With regard to the effect of the epi- Effects of the epidemic on trade, agriculture, etc. demic on trade, agriculture, etc., Mr. Maynard writes :- Trade.                                          "     The winter trade of the  cantonment shopkeepers   was seriously injured by the epidemic,   owing to the   closing  of  the  Sadr. Bazr to all who had not permits.    Elsewhere trade suffered by the diminution of intercourse, the deaths of clients and customers, and the general depression which the calamity produced. I anticipate a diminution of about 16 per cent. in the income tax demand. ' Liquor contractors benefited because spirit is regarded as a prophylactic. Agriculture.                                                                  " Agriculture suffered but little.   The autumn crop had been reaped before the epidemic began and it had  passed its  zenith  before  the spring harvest. Litigation and crime.  Treatment of plague orphans. Education                                  Litigation almost ceased while plague continued, but crime was   encouraged by the unprotected  state   of   property   in   evacuated villages, and thefts and burglaries were numer- ous.    Civil cases were postponed, but most criminal cases were disposed of after the prisoner, and  witnesses  had  been quarantined for ten days.    Some families were wiped out altogether leaving property to be dealt with as unclaimed ; and many left only minor orphans, whose goods were temporarily taken charge of by the  executive  authorities  pending  settlement   of  the question of guardianship. "Schools   were  always closed   in infected places,   and   the school masters when not employed as branch post masters utilised for work connected with the plague administra- tion." Measures taken with a view to prevent outbreaks  of (d) The people were strongly advised by Measures taken with a view to prevent outbreaks  of  the Deputy Commissioner to protect themselves plague in uninfected places. the Deputy Commissioner to protect themselves by excluding strangers, and of this he writes : - " The desirability of excluding;  persons   from  infected places   was   everywhere   un- derstood, and in  some villages  their   exclusion Attempts to exclude persons from infected areas. was   vigorously   enforced.    But   the selfishness of influential individuals, the lack of cohesion and organized authority in most communities and the pressure of social obligations combined with the natural apathy of the majority to frustrate in some measure the promptings of prudence. There were cases in which men forcibly intruded themselves or their relatives upon an unwilling village, or reluctantly admitted dangerous guests, whom they would gladly have excluded if they could have pleaded an order of Government against their admission. Nevertheless outbreaks were in a few instances averted, and in many instances deferred, by the efforts of the people to protect themselves. It was a common thing to find roads diverted so as not to pass directly through a village, and the wells were often very closely watched owing to an impression that the disease is communicated through water." No mention is made of the surveillance over arrivals in towns. (e) In addition to the measures adopted by the people themselves, caste and other gatherings were prohibited by the Deputy Commissioner, who writes : - " Caste gatherings, including wedding barts, were prohibited except by special sanction. A number of applications for sanction were refused, and in some cases the orders were violated. The bart is undoubtedly a very dangerous vehicle of disease, and "several outbreaks are traceable to local marriages. The people who were not personally interested in the festivities were often very eager to have them prohibited."
?25 Methods of obtaining information. (f)       Very little is said either by.  the Deputy Commissioner or the  District Plague Medical Officer as to  the   methods by which information concerning plague occurrences was obtained.    It appears, however, that the methods were  similar  to those of other districts, though less complete. With reference to this subject the following remarks of the Plague Medical Officer and the Deputy Commissioner may be quoted.    The former writes :- " It is not necessary to go into details of each village,-indeed the details in most cases are not forthcoming. Much of the information which we tried to collect was given by irresponsible people living in the villages, and we had neither the time nor the opportunity to verify their statements " Commenting on the value of the statistics concerning plague in his district, the Deputy Commissioner writes :- " Except in the Ambala Cantonment (where there was wholesale concealment both of cases and deaths in order to avoid compulsory segregation), the statistics of deaths from plague are everywhere approximately correct. But the value of the figures for plague seizures varies very greatly. In many places it is known that non-fatal cases were not re- ported. Even when all distrust of the intentions of the authorities had been removed, individuals were inclined to be reticent about sickness in their households, partly to prevent the neigh- bours from shunning them and partly to forestall difficulties over the funeral rites of the dead. Mild cases were often not recognized as plague, and when evacuated villages scattered over wide areas, as they sometimes did, the reporting agency was not always reliable " Evacuation.              (g) ' Evaculation was very generally adopted, though the degree of thoroughness with which  it  was  carried  out  varied   greatly   in different villages and among different classes. In some towns and villages all that people did in the way of evacuation was to live on the roof of their houses, and Mr. Maynard considers that the mortality in the town of Ambala was probably reduced by the measure.    He adds : - " It is an undoubted palliative, but is apt to loose efficacy because of the temptation to which people living on their roofs are subject to visit their rooms and keep their clothes and other belongings there." Captain James writes :- " It was common to see a whole village or a large section of it hurrying out into huts and shelters in their fields on the outbreak of plague in the village. Some nearly always stopped in, others only slept outside at night, and finally, as confidence was again resorted, back would come those who first went out." Mr. Maynard devotes considerable notice to the subject of evacuation ; the following are extracts from his remarks. After remarking upon the difficulties attendant upon evacuation during the cold weather, Mr. Maynard notes :- " As soon as the warmth began, the Jt, whether Sikh or Hindu, who makes up the bulk of the agricultural population in the affected tracts was ready to live in the open, and in most cases to provide his own shelter ; and his Muhammadan brother of the Sutlej Valley, who has heard for several years past of the experiences of the Hoshiarpur District, was fairly ready to follow his example." The opposition to evacuation on the part of Rjpt Brahmans and the majority of the shopkeeping classes is noticed, though there were some exceptions among the last- named class. " Townsmen," Mr. Maynard remarks, " will never turn out," though he adds that the town of Kharar was more than half evacuated. Mr. Maynard goes on to say :- " The conversion of the rural pouplation to evacuation, as a counsel of perfection, is the best possible evidence of its efficacy, and this conversion was complete. " As knowledge spread purely agricultural villages commonly abandoned their houses immediately on the discovery of dead rats, and in some instances did so merely because neighbouring villages had become infected. At one time half the country side on the direct line between Rpar and Kharar was out in camp, though deaths from plague had occurred in a few villages only." Of the difficulties connected with evacuation, Mr. Maynard notes: - " Rain and cold weather are the greatest obstacles to evacuation. In most villages the people have little spare clothing for themselves, their cattle undoubtedly suffer much from exposure, and it is impossible to provide satisfactory hutting for large numbers." He also remarks on  the  great  difficulty  in  evacuating  for   men  who  have  many belongings, and notes :- In the days of police cordons, property was fairly  safe  even  when removed into camp or left in a deserted town or village.
?26 " Now evacuation invites the thief,   both  professional  and  casual,  and burglaries of varying degrees of seriousness were numerous." Two other difficulties are also noticed by Mr. Maynard.     He writes :- " It is not always easy to induce people to stay out long enough. Two or three days without a fresh case encourage them unduly, and there was one very melancholy instance of premature return, when a village which had turned out cheerfully and escaped very lightly in consequence went back too soon and was decimated. " Again, under the permissive system there is almost always a minority which declines to leave an infected site ; and there are always individuals who continue to revisit their homes or keep their cattle there. The people outside are very nervous about those who stay in, and suspect them of pilfering. The recalcitrant minority creates two 'other difficul- ties. There is no real isolation of the people outside, and evacuation loses part of its effect and becomes discredited. Moreover, as the disease continues among those who stay in, or revisit the village, those who stay out do not get the full benefit   of their   sacrifice . and become disheartened by long delay." That evacuation was beneficial in checking the outbreaks of plague will be evident from what has been recorded above : its efficacy varied in accordance with the thoroughness with which it was carried out. Cordons and guards. (h) Of the employment of guards for evacuated villages the Deputy Commissioner notes :- " In one or two instances the people themselves contributed for extra watch and ward. When I realized the position I sanctioned the payment from District Funds of one extra chaukdr for every fifty vacated houses in partially evacuated villages, but more than this should be done, if money can be spared, and arrangements should be made to supply police on payment-" Segregation of sick and contacts.              (i)    As in the case of evacuation, the extent to which segregation of sick and contacts was observed varied very greatly.    Hinds were generally speaking  much more careful in this respect than Muhammadans.    Mr. Maynard notes :- " The Muhammadans of the towns prided themselves on showing the complete- ness of their trust in God by associating closely with infected persons. In the Ambala City I was assured that they at one time decided to ostracise any of their number who showed caution in this respect." In the villages, Mr. Maynard writes :- " There was very wide divergence of practice. In some places the panic was so severe that one family would hardly venture near another, and in one place I found the improvised shelters of the refugees scattered broadcast over miles of country. Each man feared his neighbour. In other places it was impossible to disentangle the sick from the health camps." Disinfection. Attitude of the people towards disinfection.  Extent to which chemical disinfection was 'adopted. Review of the measure.  (i)The following remarks concerning disinfection are abstracted from Mr. Maynard's  report.    It should be stated  that  the   opinions expressed by  Mr.   Maynard  are supported by Captain James. It should also be added that when chemical disinfection was adopted it was carried out in accordance with the directions contained in the Memorandum on Disinfection, the green  in 1000 solution of perchloride of mercury being used for the disinfection of houses and phenyle I  in too for personal effects. Special gangs of disinfecting coolies were employed, who worked under the supervision of an Assistant Surgeon. The attitude of  different  classes towards disinfection will   appear  from  the  extracts given below, but it may be remarked  here that where   persuasion  failed,   orders  were  usually successful in inducing objectors to accept chemical disinfection.   On this point Mr. Maynard notes : - " After the resources of persuasion had been exhausted, I passed a good many formal orders in Ambala town requiring people to facilitate disinfection on pain of prosecution. Most of them needed but a gentle push to send them over the line of submission ; but till the push came there was a good deal of trouble and delay, which impeded and restricted the operations. " In the Rpar   Tahsl,   33 villages were disinfected completely and ten partially. and in Kharar 14 were completely disinfected. In the city of Ambala 807, and in Rpar town 1,143, houses were disinfected, the number in the  latter  case making   up  nearly  the whole of the town.    Many houses in the towns of Jagdhri and Kalka underwent the process, and
?27  two villages completely and one partially in the Naringarh Tahsl. The operation consisted in washing down the inside of the rooms and furniture with acidulated mercury solution coloured with green aniline dye. Clothes and articles likely to be damaged by the solution were dipped in strong phenyle solution. The effects varied in direct ratio to the completeness of the operation. When a whole village was disinfected, after evacuation, it remained free throughout the remainder of the epidemic. Where, as in Klka and Ambala City, it was only possible to disinfect the actual house, and in some places only the actual room in which the patient lay, the result was small and the disease reappeared either there or in the near vicinity. Objections to disinfection.  Practical objection  to  the  use  of  perchloride of "Some   Hinds   objected   to   green,   as  a  Muhammadan  colour.    Many Muham- madans objected to the perchloride of mercury altogether,   until a " fatwa " was obtained from the local theologians and circulated on lithographed broad-sheets commending perchloride as unobjectionable. The theologians declined to make a pronouncement with regard to the phenyle. Phenyle leaves a slight odour and the Prophet forbade the faithful to worship with clothes that smell of onions or anything similar. So boiling in plain water was substituted for phenyle in the case of those who raised the religious question. " Disinfection with perchloride is  totally  unsuited  to  operations on  a  large   scale in rural tracts. It is extremely expensive, it requires supervision by a skilled agency, and therefore can only be done very slowly, and it mercury. therefore can only be done very slowly, and it is impossible  to   persuade  people   to stay out of their houses for long after the disease appears to have stopped, so that whatever is done ought to be done at once. Under the voluntary system, moreover, some corners will always remain untouched, even if the strength of the staff is sufficiently increased to get round the large number of villages that await their coming ; and an incomplete operation is likely to fail and discredit altogether the means employed. In one or two villages in Rpar there were complaints that the cattle died from licking the disinfected walls."  Other methods of disinfection. Desiccation. Equifex Disinfector. (k)    Of the methods of disinfection adopted by the people themselves Mr. Maynard notes :- " The making of holes (mogs) in the roofs of kacha houses is a practice which the people understand. Left to themselves, they make the holes too small, and close them up too early ; but it is not difficult to school them on these points. "The burning of nm leaves and wheat straw over the floors was carried out in some villages which could not,   or would not, wait for the skilled disinfectors. " The notion of killing germs by sunlight and fresh air commended itself to many : because it is a regular native practice to sun the best clothes of the family at certain seasons in order to keep out the moths. " Some experiments were tried in Ambala  City with a desiccator. The results, however, are not reported. " An Equifex Disinfector was in use for a time in  the  city  of  Ambala,  and   people seemed willing enough to have clothes disinfected in it.    A  returned   Hji   said   it   was like   the machine   in  use at  Kamrn,  and  this   made it popular among Muhammadans." Both  the  Deputy  Commissioner  and  the  Plague   Medical   Officer emphasize  the desirability of some methods of disinfection which, besides  being efficacious, should   also be cheap and harmless and suitable for application by the people themselves. The Deputy Commissioner also notes the popularity of phenyle.    He writes :-" One is frequently asked for ' falain ' or ' lasswli dawi,' the medicine that turns water  white  as milk." Inoculation by the District staff.  (l)   The total number of inoculations performed in the Ambala District by the District staff was 48,350     Of these 37,722 were perform- ed up to the end "of July 1902, and it is  to these that the remarks given below refer. In this number are included 1,381 inoculations of resi- dents in Patila territory and 1,381 of inhabitants of the Kalsia State and of other British districts. 489 inoculations were performed in August and 10,147 in September 1902. These last formed part of the inoculation operations undertaken in connection with the plague epidemic of 1902-03. Of the inoculations carried out up to the end of July 1902 Captain James writes :- " The great feature of the measures carried out against plague in this district is undoub- tedly the anti-plague inoculations. It has been extremely popular in the western part of the district. Wherever plague has been most prevalent, there inoculations have also been largely resorted to. Morinda Thna suffered most with 10,277 cases. In this thana 6,931 persons were inoculated. Then follows Kharar Thna 6,892 cases, 8,340 persons inoculated :; Ambala Thna 5,728 cases, 5.527 inoculations ; Rpar Thna is exceptional in having only 2,010 cases and as many as 7,427 inoculations. The .people came in here from villages before the disease had reached them.''
?28 The following description of the inoculation operations in the Ambala  District   is taken from Mr. Maynard's report :- " The first inoculations were performed at the request of a Sikh village in the Rpar Tahsl about a month after the commencement of the epidemic. This example fired the neighbours, and it was soon found that people near the Patila border were apply- ing to the Assistant Surgeons of that State to inoculate them. Captain James, the Civil Surgeon, was at that time tied to head-quarters by the charge of a Jail. He was relieved about the middle of March, and a Medical Missionary (Dr. F. V. Thomas, M.B.), arrived from Gurgaon to assist in the work. For some time the work of the inoculators in the Rpar and Kharar Tahsls was limited only by their physical capacity to deal with the crowd of applicants. On two or three occasions work was stopped by the pressure of the multitudes, and it was necessary to surround the operators with barriers and even to employ police to keep a clear space. Whole villages turned out and tramped, men, women and children, miles to find the inoculator. Many people presented themselves twice or three times. The clerks could not fill in the registers and certificates fast enough. Work could have been found for five times the available staff, though some assistance was given at Rpar by a lady doctor (Miss Eltzholtz), and at the later time some Assistant Surgeons were trained to assist. " Meanwhile the system was being introduced into the south of the district by the work of Lieutenant-Colonel Esmonde White and Captain Blackham in the Cantonment, to whom many persons had recourse from surrounding villages. Later on the Civil Surgeon performed a number of inoculations in the city of Ambala, assisted by Miss Carleton, M.D. Captain James enjoys an extraordinarily high reputation with the people, and many ladies were inoculated by him in preference to the lady doctor. To the confidence which he has established the district owes the remarkable popularization of the process. In Jagdhri town a notable fashion established itself among the children, both girls and boys, of coming alone, and apparently unprompted, to the Town Dispensary for inoculation. Of the 11,000 odd inoculated by Dr. Thomas, M.B., in the Kharar Tahsl, it is remarkable that 3,000 were women. The only class which held aloof was the Muhammadans of the towns, but there was no organized resistance or boycotting of inoculated individuals." On the subject  of  accidents   attending in- Accidents attending inoculation. oculation operations Captain James writes:- "The accidents attending the operations were practically \ill\. Not a single case of abscess following the puncture was reported. In eight cases, in spite of special precautions being taken to prevent it, persons actually suffering from plague or developing it on the day of inoculation came to our notice. It probably did little harm, but, it is needless to add, it could not have done the patients any good." As in other districts, so in Ambala there were all sorts of stories   current  as  to   the evil    effects    of    inoculation.    Mr.   Maynard writes :  - " There   was   much   nervousness    about  inoculation  among  people who  had not seen it done.    The  needle   was  a  yard  long ; False stories about inoculation.          you died immediately after the  operation : you survived the operation just six months and then collapsed ; men lost their virility and women became sterile ; the Deputy Commissioner himself underwent the operation and expired half an hour afterwards in great agony ; and other like nonsense. It was a favourite story that payment for the operation would be demanded sooner or later. Pains were taken to contradict these stories." Captain James also mentions a check to inoculation which occurred owing to a report that a child had died from its effects.    He writes : - " In the beginning of April there was a sudden check to the inoculations on account of an apparently healthy child dying the day after being inoculated. But on investigation it was proved that it had died from plague. The father admitted that in his office, where he worked during the day, several rats had died and one was actually found on the same mat on which the child used to sleep, during his office hours. All the other people inoculated with the same bottle at the same time as the boy developed no bad symptoms. There was therefore no reason to suspect the prophylactic. However, the rumour did much harm, and it took some time to reassure the people. They ultimately came in in numbers to be done." Owing to the defective   reporting  of  plague  occurrences    which  has  been noticed previously, it is not possible to make a   detailed estimate  of  the results of  inoculation.     Such Information as could be obtained is given in the following extract from Captain James' reports. it will be seen from this that the measure was most beneficial.    Captain James notes :- " The benefits of inoculation were most marked both in preventing attacks from plague as well as diminishing the death-rate among those attacked after inoculation. Among the 37,722 persons inoculated only 105 subsequently contracted the disease. That is to say only a or 3  out of every  thousand  persons  inoculated subsequently  got plague..   Taking the
?29 whole uninoculated population of the whole district and including the eastern thns, which were never infected, we find that out of every thousand persons no less than 38 contracted plague. This shows that the inoculated are ten times safer than the uninoculated. If we turn to the actual list of those attacked as given underneath- Table showing the number of days after inoculation, persons attacked with Plague. DAYS AFTER INOCULATION.                        on day of  inocu-                         2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 lation 8 9 13 7 6 7 3 3               1 1 1 1  2 1 3 2    1               1st week 53 cases.       3rd week 12 cases.       2nd week 14 cases,       4th week 8 cases.       6th week 2 cases.       5th week 7 cases.       7th week 4 cases.       Note.-Besides these, ore  person  was attached  55 days after inoculation, another 57, a third 68 and a fourth 90  days after   in- oculation.   The details of the remaining 1 case is unknown. we find that 30 people shewed signs of plague within 72 hours of being inoculated, after which the drop in the attacks is a large one. These 30 ought certainly not to count, as they were probably all infected before inoculation. This would reduce the number of attacks to about .2 per cent., which probably represents the correct number. " The effect of inoculation is also well marked in reducing the mortality in the disease Among   the  uninoculated  the   case   mortality  was  as high   as   76   per   cent.,   or   about  . 10 per cent, above the average death-rate for this disease in former years ; while among   the inoculated it was only 41.9 per cent., i e. .23 per cent, below  the  usual average, and 34 per cent, below that of the uninoculated in the same epidemic. " These results are so marked that, taken with similar results obtained elsewhere there is little room for doubt as to the efficacy of the prophylactic. It only remains to add that the inoculations were carried on in the height of the epidemic and among the most severely infected villages." Methods of  infection        Plague in grain.                                            (m)    No reference is  made  either  by  the Deputy  Commissioner or by the Plague Medical   Officer as to the manner in which the infection of plague    is disseminated through infected places or contracted by human beings or other animals, though in the case of rats the Deputy Commissioner surmises that they may contract the disease by eating infected grain, as will appear from the extract from the Deputy Commissioner's report, given below : - On the subject of the conveyance of infection to places previously infected from plague, Mr. Maynard remarks that in no instance is the process of the importation of plague otherwise than by human agency. He notes that in the commencement of  the outbreak, the district was threatened by several centres of infection from British Districts and the Patila State, also that the first infection of the district probably came from a Ludhina village and the second from Sirhind Bassi in the P atila State. He adds " it matters little, for in January infection flowed in like a rising tide from all quarters." The Ambala Cantonment became infected at Christmas probably by a tailor from the Jullundur District, and became the source of infection of the town of Ambala, Kharar, Jagdhri and many villages in the Ambala Tahsl. Although Mr. Maynard records the want of proof of the carriage of infection by other than human agency, his report does not afford any information as to whether infection was usually conveyed directly by persons suffering from plague or by infected clothing or other personal effects. That infection could be carried by clothes was however recognised by the people fairly soon, and in all towns the practice of burning clothes of persons who died of plague was introduced, and was acquiesced in by sweepers who had previously suffered severely from taking the abandoned clothes of the dead. Mr. Maynard is inclined to the opinion that infection may be carried in grain, for he writes :- " The frequency with which  plague made  its first appearance,   or its worst ravages, among grain-dealers and porters or others who handle grain,   and   in   the   neighbourhood   of grain markets, is noteworthy. Rats were often attacked first. I suggest the explanation that they contracted infection from grain, which, being cooked before its consumption by human beings, did not affect the latter."
30 Influence of the local conditions on the epidemic  (n)   The influence of season upon the spread of plague has been noticed in the review. of the epidemic.    Owing to causes already men- tioned an accurate estimate of the extent of local variation in the incidence and fatality of plague is not feasible. Mr. Maynard notices the comparative mildness of the outbreaks in towns and villages situated in the low hills bordering the district on the north.    He writes :- " It is noteworthy that no village in the belt of country just below the Siwliks suffered at all severely.    The sub-soil water level in this tract is generally very low." Mr. Maynard also notes that- " I observed less liability to virulent disease in the clay lands than in the sandy and loamy tracts. It may have been merely a coincidence that field rats were far less prevalent in the former than in the latter."                                                                                      Rat mortality (o)    Of mortality among rats Mr. Maynard writes :- " As already observed, mortality frequently commenced among rats. In Klka the first cases occurred among shopkeepers, of whom two were attacked. After an interval of about ten days deaths were noticed among rats. A little later again the disease showed itself in epidemic form among human beings. In the case of Jagdhri town, where few of the people died, there was extremely heavy mortality among rats." Mr. Maynard also mentions an extraordinary increase in the number of field rats before and during the epidemic, and a great mortality among these animals in the south of the district during May. It is also noticed that squirrels were often infected with plague, and that the people believe that dogs, jackals and cats also suffered from the disease. Deaths of buffaloes, bullocks and donkeys have also been attributed by people to plague, and at the end of June heavy mortality among kine was reported to have been carried in the Naraingarh Tahsl by a disease caused by swellings. No mention is made of any measures taken with regard to rats. Type and severity of disease.           (p)     Of the type of the    disease,  Captain James notes that the disease was almost entirely bubonic in character: a few pneumonic cases were recorded. The severity of the disease has already been noticed. Liability and immunity of classes.                       (q)    With regard to the prevalence of plague   among  different classes of  the   com- munity, Mr. Maynard notes :- "Hindus, as a whole, suffered less than Muhammadans, who are more permeater with the spirit of resignation to destiny. This difference in the susceptibility of the two communities was specially marked among agriculturists. But Rjpts   of both religions, even when most impracticable in their attitude, were generally less severely visited than their neighbours -a circumstance which I attribute to greater personal and domestic cleanli- ness.    Sikhs were fortunate, because almost always reasonable. " Brahmans generally died like flies when plague got among them ; but in two villages where they were persuaded to leave their houses, they got off lightly. It has been suggested that both Brahmans and Banias suffer severely because they spend so much time," nearly naked and shoeless, exposing a large surface of unprotected skin. " Handicraftsmen of all kinds, weavers, potters, leather-workers and the like suffered very much, because the nature of their work made it hard to persuade them to move. Women, particularly at the age when they are most rigidly kept within doors, were very susceptible, but here again the Rajpts  often seemed to be an exception to the rule " Official and semi-Europeanised clas ses were almost immune. Recommendations.    General considerations.  Exclusion of persons from infected areas.                                (r)    Captain James makes no suggestion except as regards popular methods of  disin- fection which   have already been quoted.    Mr. Maynard, however, devotes considerable atten- tion to the subject of future plague policy and makes some valuable   suggestions which   are embodied in the extracts from his report given below :- " The measures authorised by Government   are  now   in some respects behind, rather General considerations.  than   in   advance   of,   what   general   opinion would   approve.    It   must   be   realized   that- people cannot altogether protect themselves. A community that is not completely organized for self-government hardly knows what it wants, and certainly cannot enforce its will without external help. It is not fair that it should be at the mercy of selfish or reckless individuals. " The existing rules recognize the right of villagers to   exclude persons from infected areas. They do not  specifically  authorise  the enforcement of this right by Government  officers ; but I have taken it for granted that the one thing implies the other, and, when asked to do so by headmen, I have forcibly excluded persons whom they found themselves unable to expel. If this procedure is right, it ought to be definitely sanctioned. It certainly has the stroug support of public opinion.
?31 " In towns the right to exclude persons coming from infected areas is specifically withheld. This is undoubtedly felt as a grievance. It is apparently held that surveillance over arrivals is a sufficient precaution, but arrivals are not reported. Surveillance is a farce, and in the crowded and often kacha buildings of our little towns plague spreads like fire in straw, unless a case is isolated without a moment's delay. " I do not at present recommend the use of physical force to effect the exclusion of any person from a town. But I can find no reason why, on the complaint of a person occupying adjoining premise, an uninoculated new arrival from an infected area should not be subject to prosecution, with t e alternative of immediate withdrawal. Section 204 of the Punjab Municipalitie Act furnishes a convenient precedent. New arrivals in uninfected streets or mohalls of an infected town should be placed on the same footing with new arrivals from other infected towns or villages. Cases were not uncommon in which frightened neighbours came to me with the complaint that so and so had brought his family from an infected house to live next door ; but unless Section 269 of the Indian Penal Code covers the case (which is not always clear) there is no remedy at present for this palpable wrong. " We shall be following the line of least resistance if we draw a sharp distinction between those   ho in any way spread disease and those who stay at home and suffer. " There need be no fear of alienating public sentiment by drastic measures against the former. Quarantine camps.                   Order prohibiting intercourse between infected and  uniniected villages. Arrangements to permit of the isolation  of villages  in threatened tracts. Coercive measures against recalcitrant minorities in rural areas, especially with regard to evacuation. Encouragement  of   evacuation   by   provision of chaukdrs. Permission to  store valuables  in  treasury strong rooms.          " Traders and persons with urgent business could avoid molestation by undergoing inoculation, and now that this operation has been so widely popularized there is no hardship in requiring this.    I would, however, for the present, provide for the case of those who  wish to   visit    uninfected    places,    by   establishing quarantine  camps  for  departures   outside   all infected centres of importance. These camps would be entirely voluntary, but any one who underwent a ten days' course in one of them would receive a certificate securing him against interference. " A definite order  prohibiting  intercourse  between   infected and uninfected villages would furnish to waverers the required excuse for evading inconvenient and dangerous social obligations. There would be no public sentiment against the enforcement of such an order by prosecution if a complaint by the headman or by a stated number of the inhabitants of the threatened village were made a condition of the initiation of proceedings. The isolation of villages in threatened tracts can be encouraged by  the provision of facilities for the supply of necessaries (including  liquor and such simple remedies as Hakims liquor and such simple remedies as Hakims and    Baids    prescribe     for     their     patients). Assistant Commissioners on plague duty should be invested with the powers of Additional District Judges for the reception of plaints, so that limitation may not run out before the plaintiff can "get to court, and they should be accompanied by petition-writers, salaried in consideration of the risk run., and licensed to sell stamps. Unless the postal staff has been generally inoculated, letters should be delivered through the agency of the plague staff. These and the like measures are not new, but I am doubtful how far the precedents of 1897 and 1898 are acted on, now that methods have changed and the trouble is more widespread.  " Rural opinion would welcome coercive measures against recalcitrant minorities, and the Deputy Commissioner should be empowered Coercive measures against recalcitrant minorities in to order the evacuation of villages by beat of drum in cases where a strong majority is clearly in favour of this course. I would not employ physical force in the event of disobedience, but prosecute offenders under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. The threat of prosecution would always suffice if the cases for coercion were well selected. I would never use the power in cold or rainy weather, nor in villages which approach to the status of towns, nor without providing hutting materials. If it is feared that zealous Deputy Commissioners might abuse it, the authority could be given to Commissioners and delegated by them at discretion.  " For the encouragement of evacuation it is better to spend  money on the, payment of chaukdrs than on the provision of huts The majority can always make shift to but themselves, but the removal or safe custody  of property   is a very serious difficulty.    In cold weather, the provision of sacking to protect the cattle, and extra blankets for the people, will often turn the scale in favour of evacuation. The rule which prohibits deposit of the  valuables  of  private  persons  in treasury strong rooms should be relaxed, and locked  and sealed receptacles should be received on the  same  terms   (except  payment)   on . which banks receive valuables for safe deposit.
?32 Encouragement of popular methods of disinfection.       " Stress may with advantage be laid on the opening up of large holes  in  kacha roofs for purposes of ventilation, because the practice fits in well with rural ideas:    Other tendencies that can be used in planning a mode of disinfection that does not require skilled supervision, are the readiness to sun clothes in order to keep out moths and to burn wheat straw or nm leaves over the floors and the popularity of phenyle as a disinfectant." (s)    The following medical officers and subordinates were employed on plague  duty in the district :- Staff and Establishment. Encouragement of popular methods of disinfection. 1.    Major C. H. James, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon and Plague Medical Officer. 2.    Lieutenant McInnes, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon and Plague Medical Officer. 3.    Major Hickey, Temporary Medical Officer. 4.    Temporary Assistant Surgeon Key, Temporary Medical Officer. 5.    Captain Blacker, Temporary Medical Officer. 6.    Temporary Assistant Surgeon Bharucha. 7.    Temporary Assistant Surgeon Nazr Husain (was attached to Kalsia State) and 6 Hospital Assistants. The following were attached to the Klka Plague Inspection Post :-- 1.    Captain Eates, Temporary Medical Officer. 2.    Miss J. Mendietta, Temporary Medical Officer, and one Hospital  Assistant and one Dhi. SIMLA DISTRICT. 39. There were 66 cases of plague with 45 deaths in the Simla District during the year 1901-02. Of these 65 cases with 44 deaths occurred in the Cantonment of Subthu and I fatal case in Simla itself. Details are not available regarding the outbreak at Subthu, though it is known that it was limited to the native occupants of the bazr. The first case occurred in August 1902, and the outbreak had not ceased by the end of the year under report. The single case which occurred in Simla was reported on August 23rd, the death of the patient having been discovered on that day. The patient had come from Subthu on August 15th, and his name had been only registered at the inspection post at Tawi, where, however, he had stated that he came from a neighbouring village. The man had lived in the top storey of a house in the bazr, a little below the Town Hall, the remainder of which was chiefly occupied by durzies. All these persons together with some occu- pants of an opposite house who were believed to have had relations with the patient were quickly removed to the segregation camp which had been kept in readiness and the whole house disinfected, with all the personal effects of the occupants. The chemical solution of perchloride of mercury was used for disinfecting the house, and clothes and other personal property were taken to Tara Devi and disinfected in the steam disinfector there. As no further case occurred among the persons segregated, they were permitted to return to their houses after the expiry of ten days. While in the segregation camp each adult received a subsistence allowance of 4 annas and each child 2 annas daily. Arrangements were made by the Civil Surgeon for offering inoculation in the early part of the Simla season, but this caused a panic " among the coolies and the wildest rumours prevailed in the neighbouring Hill States leading to the refusal of many villages to allow their children to be vaccinated. It became necessary therefore to discontinue inoculation operations in Simla, and only 345 persons were inoculated.  Measures for the protection  of  the  hill stations  in the Simla District. (a)    With the object of preventing the spread of plague to the hill stations in the Simla District, railway and road inspection posts Measures for the protection  of  the  hill stations  in were established at Klka, and arrangements the Simla District.          were   made  for  the    inspection    of    persons entering these hill stations and for their surveillance for some period after their arrival. These arrangements, in the case of Military Cantonments, were made by the Military authorities ; in the case of Simla they were under the control of the Punjab Government. (b) The following report on the inspection posts at Klka and on the arrangements for the inspection and surveillance of arrivals at Simla were written by Mr. H. D. Craik, Assistant Commissioner, who was at first in charge of the posts at Klka and was afterwards
?33 Measures relating to travellers. Road traffic.                     transferred to Simla, where  he was  previously  engaged  in  supervising  the  arrangements for the surveillance of persons coming from infected areas :- ROAD AND RAILWAY INSPECTION POSTS AT KALKA. "I arrived in Klka on January 13th, 1902.    At this time I found the town  of Klka free   from  plague,   and  the  system in   force for inspection of travellers was as follows :- 1.    Railway travellers.-The inspection   at the station was under the supervision of Captain Eates, I. S. M. D., who received his orders from the Deputy Commissioner, Simla. The system in force was that laid down in Part III (a) of the Plague Hand-book. This practically meant that all persons who were not actually suffering from suspicious symptoms were allowed to proceed after a cursory medical examination. The power given to the Inspecting Medical Officer by paragraph 5 of the rules to detain people whom he considered " specially dangerous " was, prior to my arrival, rarely or never exercised. As, however, by the middle of February the Ambala District and practically the whole of the Punjab from Ambala to Silkot was plague-infected, and as there appeared to be a great risk of the plague being carried up to Simla, if more effective measures were not taken, I ordered Captain Eates to make use of the power given by paragraph 5 in practically all cases of arrivals from infected areas. A large number of arrivals were thus detained daily in the segregation camp close to the station. At first the period of detention was ten days, but later the numbers grew so large that it had to be considerably reduced. As, side by side with the  railway traffic, there was  also  a large  number  of  travel- lers arriving daily by road at  Klka  on  their way to Simla and other  hill  stations,   it  was obvious that, as long as the latter were allowed to pass through without any supervision, the detention of railway travellers was of little use as a measure to guard the hill stations. I therefore gave orders that all travellers by road should be detained daily at the police post on the Klka-Ambala Road till I saw them myself. I visited this post twice daily and personally passed orders on every arrival. The numbers amounted to 200 or 300 bullock carts daily, about the same numbers of camels, and perhaps 100 to 150 foot- passengers. This was in March and April ; in January and February the figures were not of course so high. The majority of cartmen and camel-drivers were allowed to proceed after medical examination, as in most cases they had come from villages at so great a distance that 8 or 9 days must have been spent on the journey and the risk of infection was therefore reduced to a minimum. Later, as the area of infection spread, the number of cart and camel-drivers detained were much larger. Foot-passengers who may have stopped at infected villages on the way from their houses were in most cases detained. After this system had been in force for a short time, the numbers detained became so large that the period of detention had to be reduced from 10 to 7 or even 6 days. Even then the numbers in camp were becoming unwieldy, and I therefore decided to start work- ing the Thresh Disinfector, and to give all arrivals from infected areas the choice of remain- ing in quarantine for the whole period of incubation, or of remaining for 24 hours, and then being allowed to go after their clothes had been disinfected, provided of course they had no suspicious symptoms. This system worked excellently. Practically all detenus preferred to be allowed to go after disinfection, and only those were detained, for 8 or 10 days, who came from villages close by, known to be badly infected, or were for other reasons consider- ed specially dangerous. The choice between disinfection and detention was also given to arrivals by train, and nearly all of them chose the former.    No pressure was used in any case. I am aware that strictly speaking the detention of arrivals by road is not anywhere authorized in the Plague Rules. The principle is, however, recognised by paragraph 33 of the regulations for villages. Disinfection was only resorted to as the number of arrivals from infected areas was so large (perhaps 300 or 400 daily would be inside the figure) that it was impossible to detain all, and disinfection- was a purely voluntary alternative from first to last. Moreover, it seemed to me that the maintenance of a strong inspection post and elaborate disinfecting appliances at Klka was a waste of money, if nothing was done except to make all passengers submit to a cursory medical examination. The rules applicable to Klka, as laid down in the Hand-Book, did not contemplate the state of affairs that existed this spring, when practically every village in the Kharar and Rpar Tahsils, below Klka was infected, besides every district from Karnl to Silkot, In any case the success of the system seems to me to be its own justification. Two or three cases of plague were actually discovered among travellers, and two or three deaths occurred in the quarantine camp ; while no case of plague occurred in any hill station, till after the system had to be discontinued, after the occurrence of a number of indigenous cases in Kalka itself. Early in March, however, the Deputy Commissioner of Simla refused to sanction further expendi- ture on detention and disinfection of travellers, in view of the expressed opinion of the Government of India stated in paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Resolution on the Report of the Plague Commission quoted in the Plague Hand-Book. At the same time, as he consider- ed it urgently necessary that the interest of Simla should be guarded, he referred the matter to Government, and His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor sanctioned the continuance of the system enforcing either disinfection or detention of all arrivals from infected places,
?34 The arrangements as described above continued in force till the end of April, when, owing to the outbreak of indigenous plague in the town of Klka itself, it was considered that the disinfection of arrivals there was an illusory measure for the protection of Simla, and it was accordingly ordered that the system of disinfection at Klka should be stopped and the Thresh Disinfecting machine despatched to Simla." INSPECTION POSTS NEAR SIMLA.  (c)    The arrangements in and near Simla are described by Mr. Craik as follows :- " There were disinfection stations at Tara Devi on the Klka road and Tawi on the old road leading to Klka vi Kasauli. At Tara Devi there is a 'Thresh' Steam Disinfec- tor and at Tawi an " Equifex" (smaller) machine. The clothes of all arrivals from infected areas and localities were disinfected in these machines, and the travellers were then, their names having been recorded, allowed to proceed to Simla. " The only exceptions to the rules for disinfection were- (a) travellers by tonga ; (b) tonga drivers ; (c) drivers and guards of Government Bullock Trains. " The names of class (a) were, however, recorded at the disinfection posts. " Besides the two disinfection posts described above, there was an observation post 31/2 miles from Simla on the Mashobra road, but as it was found that no travellers from infected areas ever come into Simla by this road, it was abolished in August 1902. " The road leading into Simla via Kasumpti was also occasionally patrolled by the police. No regular guard was however kept on this road, the police visiting it at irregular intervals 4 or 5 days in each week. The number of travellers arriving by this route was insignificant. " The names of all arrivals, whether from infected or uninfected areas, were recorded at the two disinfection posts. All arrivals, with the exception of travellers by tonga and the Government Bullock Train Staff, were given certificates at these posts to the effect that their clothes have undergone disinfection or do not require it, and they were instructed to give up these " parchas " on arrival at Simla to the Mohalladr of their Mohalla. " The system of surveillance over arrivals in Simla was organised as follows :- " The native part of the station was divided into 20 wards, for each of which there was a Ward Member, a Native. The disinfection posts supplied the police daily with a list of all new arrivals, and the police in turn handed to each Ward Member a list of the new arrivals in his ward. The Ward Member had to find each of these new arrivals and to give to the police, as a proof that he had done so, the certificate given to the travellers at the disinfection post. If the Ward Member could not produce the requisite number of certificates from his ward, it was clear that he had not found all the new arrivals, and the police there- upon searched for them. The Ward Members had instructions to see all new arrivals daily for 10 days after they came to Simla. " The agency employed was thus in the main voluntary ; the system worked very well, and the surveillance exercised was an effective one. "Europeans and their servants, not living in the native parts of the station, were kept under observation for 10 days after their arrival by the police. A small force of police was detailed specially for this duty, and were instructed to make daily visits to the houses of new arrivals. Europeans themselves were not personally inspected, as this was not necessary, but natives living in the compounds of Europeans' houses were. " Tonga drivers and the Bullock Train Staff were kept by the Post Office authorities m the limits of the Post Office premises, and were not allowed to go into the bazr. These arrangements were left entirely to the Post Office authorities. " Cartmen and ekka-drivers who only stayed in Simla as a rule for 24 hours were kept under surveillance by a staff of vaccinators under the Health Officer, Simla." The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague inspection duty in the district :- 1.    Captain E. L. Perry, I. M. S. 2.    Dr. C. V. Naidu and 7 Hospital Assistants and 2 Dhis. Note.-Dr. Doyle, Health Officer of the Simla Municipality, was also employed on plague duty.
?35 Jullundur Division. KANGRA DISTRICT. 40. There was no epidemic of plague in the Kngra District during the year under report. There were, however, 5 imported cases, 4 coming from Gurdspur District and 1 from Ludhina. All these five cases were fatal. No measures to prevent the importation of plague into the district were taken except in the Dharmsla Municipality, where a Hospital Assistant was placed on extra duty to inspect all arrivals from the plains. This inspection was only in force from May 20th to July 31st, 1902. The five imported cases were all segregated as soon as discovered, and the houses in which they had lived were well disinfected ; the other inhabitants of the house were segregated for ten days and then disinfected. No inoculations were performed in this district. There were reports from two villages in the Dera Tahsl of slight mortality amongst rats, but this was not followed by any outbreak of plague. All five cases of plague were of the bubonic type. There having been only imported plague cases in the distinct, no special medical staff was detailed for plague duty, but the Hospital Assistant, Nrpur Dispensary, did plague duty in addition to his ordinary work. HOSHIARPUR DISTRICT. 41. There was no complete cessation of plague in the Hoshiarpur District during the hot weather of 1901, and by October 1st several villages in the Garhshankar Tahsl were infected ; the Hoshirpur and Una Tahsls became infected during this month, but with the exception of a few imported cases the Dasya Tahsl remained free of plague until February. The epidemic was very severe and widespread in the Garhshankar and Hoshirpur Tahsls, but less so in the Una and Dasya Tahsls. The difference is probably due in the case of the Una Tahsl to the scattered nature of the population, the villages consisting chiefly of such groups of houses in the low hills compared in this tahsl. To the late commencement of the epidemic in the Dasya Tahsl is probably due to the comparatively small number of plague cases and deaths. Details of the outbreak in each tahsl are given below. It will be noticed that while the disease was most widespread in the Garhshankar and Hoshirpur Tahsls, the case mortality was highest in the Una and Dasya Tahsls :- Tahsls.

?Bearing and attitude of the people. (a)    With regard to the bearing of the people in the presence of the  epidemic  the Deputy Commissioner notes as follows :- Bearing in the presence of the epidemic " The attitude of the people with reference to  the  disease has  in the Garhshankar Tahsil been one of oriental submission to  the inevitable.    In the   other parts of  the   district which   were  newly   infected this   year  some signs  of panic  were visible at the time of  the outbreak in the case of some villages, but the people soon settled down quietly. " The disease has generaly caused some increase in charity and a more frequent resort to devotional exercises." The Plague Medical Officer says :- " The people look upon plague as a visitation of Providence as a punishment for the sins of the people and bear the calamity resignedly. They say if it is the will of the heaven they should die, no one can help it." Of the attitude towards plague measures the Plague Medical Officer notes :-- Attitude towards plague measures. " The attitude of the people generally towards  plague measures is one of  distrust  or dislike.    They resent the interference,   though when  argued with  they admit   the  truth   of what we say that everything we do is for their good, but they are more prone to believe what mischief-makers tell them to the contrary." The Deputy Commissioner notes : - " It may, I think, be said that the definite adoption of a policy of non-compulsion and comparative laisser faire has commended itself to the great majority. In the early part of the year there was some slight audible tendency on the part of the people of tracts which had not hitherto been attacked to cry out for a reversion to the old policy as regards in- fected tracts, but the gradual advance of the disease towards themselves and the likelihood of their coming within the scope of compulsion checked the tendency." Effect on trade, agriculture, &c.  The Deputy Commissioner states that he  has   not  been  able   to   discover  that  the  disease had any material   effect  on  the  pros- parity   of  the    district    or   that   business  or agriculture were dislocated to any  untraceable extent.     There was  no scarcity   in   labour whatever or any substantial changes in litigation or crime. Preventive measures. (b)    The Plague Medical Officer remarks that a great deal was done by the people to prevent    outbreak   or  plague, and  considers that  but for this the  spread of plague would have been even greater than it was. It is stated that the people avoided visiting infected villages and postponed marriages and visits of condolence and other social obligations. Many villagers also attemped to prevent the entrance of persons from infected places until they had been segregated for ten days under the provisions of Punjab Government Notifica- tion No. 1086, dated 5th September 1901. With regard to this, however, the Deputy Com- missioner notes :- " During the outbreak in the summer of 1901 exclusion of such persons under the rural quarantine rule was fairly common, but with the change in plague policy this pre- caution was less often adopted. No doubt fear of the disease operates to a considerable extent on the people in the direction of inclining them to avoid infected places, to hesitate in inviting and receiving friends and visitors and to postponing marriages and social functions ; but it has not, I think, led to any general and organized action for preventing contact with infection." Information. (c)    Information   regarding   plague  occurrences    in   villages    was   obtained  from Patwrs,    who   were  required  to  maintain registers of plague  attacks  and   deaths  and to submit daily reports of infected villages in their halquas, to the Plague Medical Officer, through the Executive Officer ; lambardrs and chaukidars were responsible for reporting plague cases and deaths to the Patwrs. The Patwrs registers were checked by Girdwars. With regard to the reporting of plague occurrences the Plague Medical Officer notes :- " It must be noted here that all our statistics this year concerning plague attacks and deaths are unreliable owing firstly, that Patwrs do not think this as one of their ordinary duties, and secondly, by being unprofessional they make many mistakes.    In the case of some
?38 villages, cases having no buboes have not been shown as plague at all, being returned as fever, pneumonia or delerium. In other cases all kinds of diseases have been put down as plague, i.e., once plague became epidemic." The Deputy Commissioner considers that there was a decided tendency on the part of the people to conceal first cases, though reporting during the subsequent progress of the epidemic showed an improvement ; deaths were more fully reported than cases. Evacuation. (d)    The  Deputy Commissioner and the   Plague  Medical   Officer concur  that  the people appreciate the  benefits  of evacuation, Evacuation.                                                      Mr. Fagan remarking  that this  is    especially the case in the Garshahankar Tahsil, which has had a long experience of plague. Even so, however, very few villages, only 14 altogether, were completely evacuated but partial evacuation was very generally adopted. In a few instances people left their houses on the occurrence of mortality among rats, and this action combined with the disinfection of the houses in which rats had died prevented an   outbreak of plague among the people. While complete evacuation was very beneficial, the Deputy Commissioner remarks that even partial evacuation has had noticeably good results in checking outbreaks even where disinfection has not been carried out. Cordon and guards. (e)    In a few villages  guards were em-  ployed to protect property left in the houses. Segregation.  (f)    Little or no attempt  was   made  to segregate   plague  patients  and  contacts.  Mr. Fagan remarks :- " The plague patient has continued to live as usual in his home with the other mem- bers of the family. Indeed under the normal conditions of native rural life nothing else is to be expected." Medical treatment. (g)    European medical treatment was  not asked  for, except by the  people  of two villages, the   people   preferring    to   trust    to their own Hakims. Disinfection. (h)    The Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer concur in stating that chemical   disinfection   by Government  agency is unpopular; it is not the measure  itself which is objected to, but, as the Plague Medical Officer says " They do not wish their houses to be spied into and their household goods spoiled by outsiders. " Forty-one villages were, however, disinfected by Government agency according to the rules in the Plague Hand book ; 13 of these were completely disinfected-and the clothes were also disinfected-and 28 partially ; altogether 2,110 houses, consisting of 7,234 rooms, were chemically disinfected. No recrudescence occurred in villages entirely disinfected. Popular methods of disinfection. The Plague Medical Officer mentions that the  people themselves in   numerous   cases adopted  their  own  methods   of  disinfection, Popular methods of disinfection.                                                                                                    such as washing, smoking fires in their  rooms " to smoke out the ' Devi, ' " the fires being maintained for several days, making the temperature of the rooms fairly high, making holes in the roofs, white-washing walls and ' leeping ' floors.    A few burnt sulphur or frankincense in infected rooms. Inoculation (i)    Thirty thousand four hundred forty-eight inoculations  were  preformed in the year under report, 127 villages  contributing to this total.    The Deputy Commissioner remarks that this was in spite of various rumours against inoculation, as for example, that it injures the eyesight, causes paralysis, hastens outbreaks of plague, renders death  more likely, and that Medical Officers are pecuniarily interested in the measure. Gujars and Jts accepted inoculation more freely than other classes, Muhammadan Rajputs and Pathns objecting to it : most chiefly with regard to their women on account of the pardha system. Some Pathns said it was contrary to their religion to be inoculated, but no other classes objected to it on religious grounds. The Deputy Commissioner states that the measure is decidedly unpopular, this being chiefly due to actual dread of the operation ; people defer submitting to inoculation until plague is actually in their midst,, and the attacks among persons incubating plague at the time of inoculation is likely to produce an un- favorable impression. With reference to the attitude of the people towards inoculation, Mr. Fagan remarks :- " Personally I do not anticipate any rapid and widespread popular conversion in favour of inoculation. To do so would be, it seems to me, to overestimate considerably the mental progress which the agricultural masses have made ; and so far as my experience goes the urban is even more averse to inoculation than the rural population. We may provide facilities on an extensive scale, but I do not think that the people will use them until they have in the process of time learnt by actual experience the benefits of inoculation as they have those of vaccination."
?39 Inoculation was decidedly beneficial. The Deputy Commissioner gives a table, which appended below, showing the incidence and fatality of plague in 48 villages :-  Population. Cases. Deaths. Case mortality. Percentage of attacks to population. Percentage of deaths to population. Inoculated 10,579 82 17 20.1 0.8 0.16 Uninoculated  56,302 3,448 1,956 56.7 6.1 3.5 The table below gives details concerning the incidence and fatality of plague in ten villages in which a considerable proportion of the inhabitants had been inoculated prior to the outbreak of the disease. The results shown in this table are very favourable to inoculation. Table showing the highest percentage of Attacks to population and of fatality to attacks in the Hoshirpur District.

(j) As already stated there was no interval of freedom from plague in the Hoshirpur District immediately preceding the epidimic under report. The village of Ajnoha in the Garhshankar Tahsil which had become infected in May 1901 and did not become free of plague until October 1st, 1901, served as a furnace from which a large number of villages derived their infection. Another focus was Balchour in the south-east part of the Garhshankar Tahsl which derived its infection in July from a village in the Nawashahr Tahsl. Infection was introduced at many villages by refugees from the Jullundur and Ludhina Districts. In most cases the infection of the villages was clearly traced to human agency the virus being conveyed either in the bodies of plague patients or in personal effects. Fairly conclusive evidence to the effect was obtained by Dr. Datta in the case of 66 village. Once a village became infected rats played a considerable part in disseminating the disease. In some cases where a recrudescence of plague occurred it was noticed that rats died before any case among human beings.
40 In only one instance it was alleged that plague was carried from one village to another by rats. Of this case the Plague Medical Officer notes :- " In one village, Katha, it was suspected that perhaps rats were the cause of its first infection, as the people of the village complained that the Adhkra people had thrown (out of malice) dead rats in their streets during night and had infected it." The Deputy Commissioner remarks that no case of infection through grain or raticle of merchandise was satisfactorily established. Influence of local conditions. (k)    Except with regard to the  seasonal  variation of  plague, but slight reference is made to the influence of the  local  conditions  upon the epidemic. Mortality among rats and other animals. (l)    Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer state that mortal- ity among rats has  been  invaried throughout all infected villages.  It is  reported that out of 299 infected villages in the Garhshankar Tahsil rats died in 15 before human beings were attacked. The imigration of rats from infected to healthy villages has not been noticed, but on this subject the District Plague Medical Officer makes the following remarks:-- " Frequently rats have suddenly disappeared from infected villages and have return- ed after subsidence of plague. They must probably go to fields and not to villages. The reason for this supposition is twofold,-firstly, nowhere sudden increase of rats has been noticed in any healthy village before its being infected; and secondly, rats, when they find comfortable homes elsewhere, are not likely to return to their native homes." In villages in which rat mortality preceded plague among human beings the interval varied, but three to ten days were frequently said to have elapsed between the deaths of rats in a house and attacks of plague among the inmates. No relation was noticed between the extent of rat mortality and the severity of out- break of plague among human beings. Dogs and goats were stated to have died from plague. In one village two goats and two bullocks were stated to have died in consequence of eating poultice which had been applied to the buboes of plague patients. Type and severity of disease. (m) The Plague Medical Officer reports that owing to the widespread of plague and the insufficiency   of the   reporting   agency, no records  as   to   the   number  of attacks of the different types of plague, bubonic, pneumonic, septennic and of the mortality attendant upon each variety. The bubonic type was most common in certain villages ; the pneumonic type pre- vailed and in  others the mortality was very high. No unusual features of the disease were observed. Classes attacked. (n)    No   special liability of particular classes to attacks of plague was noticed, except  perhaps   in the   case of  Rajput females,   this being attributed to their   confined  and under life.    Women on the whole were more liable to attack. Of persons employed on plague duty only two were attacked, both disinfecting coolies, one of whom died. Recommendations. (o)    The  Deputy   Commissioner  and the Plague Medical Officer agree in increasing the employment of hakims for the treatment of plague-stricken, with the hope of gaining the confidence of the people. They also agree in considering chemical disinfection in villages to be of little use. The District Plague Medical Officer advises its abandonment, saying " the people will not have it." Both recommend the distribution of phenyle, though the Plague Medical Officer admits that much of it would be waisted, and the Deputy Com- missioner remarks that-" From a Police point of view the widespread introduction among the people of a poisonous substance is perhaps to be deprecated." Mr.   Fagan   notes " inoculation is undoubtedly the    main-probably the only-pro-     tective measure available for combating plague." He points out, however, the difficulty that the poor classes, who depend for their daily food upon their daily labour in submitting to inoculation, which involves some days, enforced idleness, and he agrees with Dr. Datta that a gratuity  of   I   anna  a  day  up to a
?41 maximum of 4 annas per family should be paid by Government to all poor persons of certain labouring classes who undergo inoculation. Finally Mr. Fagan says- " The true policy, I venture to think, is to adopt an attitude of sympathetic helpfulness, especially as regards inoculation, so far as this is consistent with the prudent expenditure of public funds, and the avoidance of all dislocation in social, commercial and administrative arrangements." (p) The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:- 1. Dr. D. N. P. Datta, Civil Surgeon, in addition to his ordinary duties. 2. Assistant Surgeon Jagat Narin. 3. Assistant Surgeon Uttam Chand, with 5 Hospital Assistants and 4 Com- pounders. JULLUNDUR DISTRICT. Review of epidemic. 42. There was no entire cessation from plague in the Jullundur District between the season under report and the preceding one, such as used to be the case in previous years. On the 1st October 1901 there were 20 villages remaining infected and 162 cases remaining under treatment. Up to the present season the disease was chiefly confined to one tahsl (Nawashahr), but, owing to the discontinuance of all compulsory measures and the consequent free inter- course between infected and non-infected localities, it has now spread over the whole of the district. The villages above mentioned were situated in the Nawashahr and Phillour Tahsls. Jullundur City became infected in November and the Nakodar Tahsl in December 1901. The Nawashahr and Jullundur  Tahsls remained infected throughout the. year under report and cases were returned from the Phillour and Nakodar  Tahsls in every month except August. During the season of 1900-01 from 1st October 1900 to 30th September 1901 there were 178 villages infected with 3,678 cases and 1,762 deaths ; during the present season there have been 673 villages infected with 32,873 cases and 18,959 deaths. The number of infected towns and villages and of plague cases and deaths for each tahsl is given below :- Tahsil. Number of  towns and villages. Population. Number of infected  towns and villages. Population. Cases. Deaths. Nawashahr  277  196,339 258 242, 226 8,436  3,636 Phillour 225 192,860 211 204,910 13,511  8,333 Jullundur  412  305,976 144  218,164 7,571  4,516 Nakodar  312  222,412 60  81,880 3,355  2,474  Total 1,226 917,589 673  747,180 32,873  18,959 It will be noticed that while infection was most widespread in the Nawashahr Tahsl the fatality of plague was considerably less in this than in any other tahsl. The table below shows the number of infected villages, cases and deaths weekly throughout the year under report.

This was maintained in April, but there was a considerable decrease in May followed by a rapid fall in June, July and August, only 12 cases and 3 deaths occurring in the last-named month.
?43 In September the disease again began to increase. All tahsls became infected. Although the monthly figures are highest in March, the weekly figures show that the disease reached its climax in the week ending April 5th, during which 1,988 persons were attacked with plague ; the highest number of deaths in any week occurred in the week immediately following that just mentioned, in which 1,245 persons died of plague. There were outbreaks of plague in Jullundur City and Cantonment at the head- quarters of all tahsls and in the Municipal towns of Rhon, Banga, Nrmahal, Kartrpur ; details are given below :- Name of place.

Besides these two mentioned several villages suffered from two outbreaks-a few villages were infected three times during the year-including Aur, which has been particularly unfortunate, having been infected every year since the first appearance of plague in the district in 1897. Particulars concerning some of these villages, infected more than once, are given in the table below :-

(a) The Plague Medical Officer writes that the people were, distinctly, more afraid of plague than of other infectious diseases which occur in the district such as small-pox or cholera, and yet displayed carelessness and indifference towards initiating preventive or remedial measures, except in a few instances, when fright induced the evacuation of villages. Attitude towards plague measures. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that although the people were afraid of plague they were fatalistic in the attitude, especially the Muhammadans. In villages the people attended to their sick and dead, but in Munici- palities the dead were often left for several days in houses from which the occupants had fled and had to be disposed of by the Municipal authorities. Their attitude, in the greater part of the district, towards plague measures is not actively antagonistic, and they believe that measures advocated by the Government are intended for their benefit. Money-lenders and banis are, however, almost all opposed to plague measures. Effect on agriculture, crime, &c. With regard to the effect of the epidemic on agriculture, labour, crime, litigation, &c., the Deputy Commissioner remarks as follows :- " Plague has had no marked effect in the way of interruption of agriculture, care of orphan children, scarcity of labour. As to crime, the death-rate among women has been unusually high, and it is possible that female infanticide may cease for a while in some villages. The police report that living in byres outside the village during plague out- breaks has taught the people to construct stills and do illicit distilling at their wells outside the village, but this was always a common offence in this district. As to litigation, parties have been often unable to attend on account of sickness in their families, and suits by heirs regarding property of deceased persons have increased." Precautionary measures. (b) Very little was done to protect healthy places from infection. The inhabitants of a few villages attempted to prevent the access of passengers, but the powers given to the people by Notification No. 1086, dated 5th September 1901, were but sparingly exercised, and in villages where attempts were made to adopt this precaution exceptions were made in favour of persons visiting relatives. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that the exclusion of persons from villages is almost impossible, as relatives and those who care to pay can always get in. Information. (c) Information regarding plague occurrences was obtained in the case of villages through Patwrs, who were required to main- tain a register containing the names and the particulars of persons attacked with or died of plague and to send daily reports of the number.
?46 of plague cases and deaths to the Plague Medical Officer. These reports were sent by post in the case of villages at a distance from the head-quarters of the Plague Medical Officer. Zail- drs and lambardrs were held responsible, for seeing that plague cases and deaths in their zails and Villages were reported. In Municipal towns ward members and mohalldrs were responsible for reporting plague cases and deaths in the wards and mohalls. Registers of plague occurrences were maintained by the Municipal Muharrirs who submitted daily reports to the Plague Medical Officer. The Deputy Commissioner states that on the whole plague cases were fairly reported. The first six or eight cases in a village were often not brought to light at first, the people hoping that if no more cases occurred, the village might not be declared infected and there would be no use of submitting daily reports. He adds that Municipal Committees, especially those of Rhon and Nakodar, gave no help in reporting plague occurrences. In Jullundur City cases were for a short time at first reported by an observation agency ; afterwards the people themselves reported cases and deaths freely. Evacuation. (d)    Evacuation was freely resorted to, but in most cases was only partial.    Only   17 Evacuation.                                                        villages were completely evacuated, but  about 40 were almost completely  evacuated,   only  a very small minority remaining. In several villages the people camped on the roof of their houses or moved into sheds on the  outskirts of the village.    In no case were the contents of houses completely removed and people frequently visited their houses to fetch necessaries. In the case of Jullundur City about 6,000 persons went into camp at various times. Hindus evacuated more freely than Muhammadans. As plague spread it was more usual for the neighbours of infected families to go into camp than for the plague-stricken families to leave their houses. It was impossible for more than 6,000 persons to go into camp at once, as there was not room in the neighbourhood of the city for them to encamp on. Land there is very valu- able, and the Municipal Committee was obliged to rent land for the poor to encamp upon. Cordon and guards. (e)    No  cordons or guards were employed for the protection of property in evacuated  villages or to prevent persons returning to such villages from camps. Isolation and segreation. (f)    In  a few instances attempts were made to isolate the  sick  by  removing them to cattle - sheds or to huts   outside   the   village ; segregation of contacts was not observed. Medical treatment. (g)    European treatment was but rarely asked for and then  only   in  villages.    Major Hodgkins believes that the sick  would   gladly                                                                          accept   Government  medical   treatment   if it were supervised by Europeans, and thinks that but for the opposition of a few leading men more applications for European treatment would have been made. Disinfection. (h)    Both the Deputy  Commissioner and the Plague  Medical  Officer mention that chemical disinfection was  unpopular  and  the disinfection of personal effects being  especially objected to. Forty-nine villages were, however completely disinfected and 68 partially. The Plague Medical Officer considers that the objection to chemical disinfection is primarily due to the trouble involved in emptying houses. When complete and accompanied by evacuation, chemical disinfection was beneficial. In Jullundur City some 5,000 rooms were chemically disinfected with good results. Chemical disinfection was carried out by trained disinfecting gangs under the supervision of Hospital Assistants, the instructions in the Plague Hand-book being followed. In Jullundur City, however, a few rich persons made their own arrangements, paying for the disinfectant perchloride of mercury and phenyle themselves. In places where chemical disinfection was not adopted the people sometimes lit large fires in infected rooms. (i)    The Plague Medical Officer reports that inoculation was not  carried   out to any Inoculation.                                                        great extent in the year under report. As, "however, 27,344 persons were inoculated in spite of the fact that Medical Officers O nly visited villages for the purpose of inoculation in response, to written applications, the extent to which the measure was availed of cannot be considered as unsatisfactory.
?47 Both the Plague Medical Officer and the Deputy Commissioner agree that the attitude of the people towards inoculation is distinctly favourable. Major Hodgkins observes that there were no religious or sound objection to it, but that the real Objection to it is the fever and discomfort following the operation. Mr. Le Rossignol says that although the belief in the efficacy of inoculation is gaining ground, it is difficult to persuade people to accept it until plague breaks out among them, and inoculation is generally asked for when the outbreak has run its course, hence making it difficult to estimate its efficacy. The Deputy Commissioner mentions two villages-Jasso Mazra and Mazri,- in both of which a large population of the inhabitants were inoculated when plague was rife, with the result that the outbreak ceased almost immediately. Information is not availabe for insti- tuting a comparison between the condition as regards the incidence and fatality of plague of inoculated and uninoculated proportion of the population of infected villages. There are records of 89 attacks among inoculated persons with 41 deaths, or a case mortality of 46.07 per cent, as compared with a case mortality of 57.67 per cent, among the uninoculated population. The ratio of deaths to attacks at different periods after inoculation is shown in Statement No. 9 (Appendix B). Infection. (j)    The spread of plague was very largely due  to  human   intercourse, having been carried from place to   place  either by  persons suffering from or incubating the  disease or   in personal effects, chiefly clothes and bedding.    Once introduced into a  town   or village  the spread of the disease was in a large measure due to rats. The Plague Medical Officer says : " four-fifths of the villages infected reported excessive deaths among the animals prior to the outbreak of the disease among human beings." It is probable, however, that in most instances the rats derived the infection from human cases that were not reported, or from plague-infected effects, and that the epidemic among human beings -as opposed to the previous isolated cases-were largely dependant upon the outbreak among rats. In some instances it appears probable that rats actually conveyed the plague from an infected village to a neighbouring healthy one. Infulence of local conditions, climate, &c.  (k)    The effect  of climate upon plague has been incidentally  referred to in describing the course of the  epidemic.    With  regard to other conditions Major Hodgkins remarks :- " It has not been practicable to make any comparison with respect to the influence of sanitary surroundings, water-supply, and habits of the people, as they are, practically, similar throughout the district. As regards soil, however, there is some reason to believe that .where it is of a sandy nature with the sub-soil water within a few feet of the surface, the conditions are not favourable to the prevalence of plague. Statistics of 22 villages in the Bet-a tract bordering the Sutlej River and about 20 feet below the remainder of the   district-and  22  others  on  the  higher land,   appear  to   strengthen  this  view." Mortality among rats and other animals. (l)    Reference  has    already  been   made  to  mortality  among  rats.     The   Deputy Commissioner notes : - " In villages infected during the previous season plague generally makes its re-appear- ance first among the rats. Rats begin to die from 3 to 7 days before human beings are attacked. In villages infected by imported cases rats die after the first few cases among human beings. " In Jullundur City the mortality among rats was very great and the disease was to a great extent spread by rats. The Plague Officer has seen as many as fifty dead rats taken out of a single roomed shop while it was being disinfected. " The city sweepers kill many rats ; but the general public are averse to taking their lives and content themselves with catching them alive in traps and letting them loose in another part of the city." The Plague Medical Officer says- " There is no record of a high percentage of attacks among human beings where the mortality among rats was excessive, nor is there evidence of relationship one way or the other. " The headmen of villages and medical subordinates on plague duty were enjoined to instruct the people as follows. Rats found dead were not to be touched with the naked hand, some kerosine oil was to be poured over the body, which was then to be covered over with some dry grass or twigs and burned and buried on the spot found, if practicable."
?48 Type of disease. (m) The bubonic type of plague prevailed throughout the district, only a few cases of pneumonic plague and none of the septicmic type were brought to notice. Major Hodgkins, remarks that the disease was of a much milder type among the majority of those attacked towards the end of this epidemic. The severity of the disease varied greatly in different parts of the district and in different towns and villages. As has been already said, although the disease was most widespread in the Nawashahr Tahsl, it was not so severe. The incidence of attacks of plague to the population of infected towns and villages in the Nawashahr Tahsl was only 3.48 per cent. as com- pared with 6.59 per cent. in the Phillour Tahsl and the fatality of attacks in the Nawashahr Tahsl was only 43.10 per cent. as compared with 73.74 per cent. in the Nakodar Tahsl. It is possible that in the Nakodar Tahsl the reporting of plague cases was not as complete as in the Nawashahr Tahsl, but it is believed that will account for only a small amount of the difference between the case mortality of plague in the two tahsls. Particu- lars of each tahsl will be found in Statement No. 1 (Appendix A). The table below gives the particulars of certain villages in which the incidence and fatality of plague was high : - Table showing particulars of outbreaks in certain villages in which the incidence and fatality of plague were highest in the Jullundur District.

If this be so, however, the incidence of attacks to the population must be higher than is shown. Classes affected. (n) It is reported that Hinds and Sikhs suffered more severely than Muhammadans ; the percentage of attacks to population among the former has been 4 while among the latter it was only 2. In Jullundur City, however, the Arains suffered more than other classes, and this is attributed by the Deputy Commissioner to the fatalistic attitude of the people and their insanitary mode of living, many of these keeping manure heaps in the court-yards of their houses. The Hindu shopkeepers in the Jullundur City suffered but lightly, and the circum- stance is quoted by the Deputy Commissioner as showing that little infection can be caused by merchandise. No unusual features of the disease were noticed, and the Plague Medical Officer remarks that the number of cases treated was so small that no comparison could be made of different methods of treatment.
?49 Remarks and suggestions. (g)    The   Plague   Medical   Officer has no remarks   or  suggestions to  make, but Mr. LeRossignol, the  Deputy  Commissioner, writes as follows :  " The old measures were decidedly repugnant to all the people in this district. Many natives who seemingly gave us their support secretly worked against us and prayed for the day when the measures should be abolished. " Under the present conditions most zaildrs and some of the lambardrs give great assistance. Municipal members gave no help whatever. Bans and Khatris in rural tracts are obstructive. In Jullundur City the ward members and chief men worked well during the first month-and-a-half of the outbreak, and after that did nothing at all. After the Lieutenant-Governor's Darbr in March nearly all the chief men ceased to do any work, some because they had got their reward and others because they had got no reward. " In the district any return to the old order of things is impossible. The disease must be allowed to run its course with a minimum of damage. Disinfection in rural tracts should be totally discontinued. In the cold weather extensive opportunities for inoculation should be given and the chief men should be encouraged to get the people to adopt it. " The Jullundur Municipality has come to the end  of  its  resources,   and  will,   next plague season, have perforce to content itself with the provision of a hospital. " The old chhappars will be issued, but no new ones will be available.    It seems to me that the reporting of plague cases in each village entails very great but useless labour. " The plague deaths can always be collated from the chaukdrs' books, and if it is necessary to have statistics of cases as compared with deaths for the purpose of checking the value of inoculation, I think that these statistics might be collected in the case of, say, six representative villages in each tahsil. "This modification would bring great relief." Staff and establishment. (h)    The following Medical   Officers  and  subordinates   were  employed  on    plague duty in the district : - (i)    Major H. C. Hodgkins, Temporary Medical Offier. (2)    Captain G. Browse, I. M. S. (3)    Dr. Beley, Temporary Medical Officer.. (4)    Dr. Karm Singh, Temporary Medical Officer.

The following review of   the   epidemic   in  the   Ludhina   District   is taken   in extenso from the admirable report of  the  late Dr. Fateh Chand who   carried out   the duties of Plague Medical Officer in addition to those of Civil Surgeon. "The district has just passed through a terrible outbreak. It lasted from October 1901 to July 1902, and was exceptional for its far and wide extension and alarming death-rate. Out of 845 villages in the district, 653 and all the five Municipal towns were attacked, and the total loss of life amounted to 47,951. "The epidemic had three "epochs." The "first epoch" was of gradual growth and rise of the plague. It extended from the latter part of October 1901 to the middle of February 1902. The "second epoch" was that of the "climax" and activity and it lasted up to the first week of May 1902. The third was of its abrupt " decline " and cessa- tion. This continued to July 1902. The total duration of all the three epochs was nine months, and that might be called the " life of plague " or the " plague season " of the district. " In the case of villages and towns a similar range of epochs was noticed, but their individual duration was shorter. The total period of plague in villages of ordinary size was. 10 to 12 weeks and of towns 14 to 18 weeks. But the length of this period was subject to variations as the place was attacked in the first epoch of the epidemic or in the succeeding stages. Those that were attacked early had it longer than those attacked during the climax.
?50 Brief history pf its invasion.  "The first case of plague occurred at Dholewl in Samrla Tahsl on the 22nd October 1901. This village is about 36 miles from the head-quarters and within the distance of 4 miles from the town of Bassi in the Patila Territory where plague had been going on for some time. The infection was brought from this town through human intercourse. On the 29th October the villagers agreed to put the sick in huts and to segregate the contacts. A few days after the infection was carried to the village of Sohwi, a mile-and-half away, and these two villages formed the first focus of the plague outbreak in the Samrla Tahsl. " On and about the 4th November a village called Salimpur, just adjacent to Sidhwn, where plague had broken out in previous summer, became infected by a dhobi who had been going to villages across the Sutlej in the Jullundur District. The other theory with regard to the break-out of the disease in this village is that it was a recrudescence of the plague from Sidhwn. This formed the second focus in the Jagraon Tahsl of the district. " The third place infected was Nrpur in the Bet of the Ludhina Tahsl, and this place got its infection through a Brahman boy, also from Jullundur District. This occur- red on the 9th December, and by this time three focii had been established at three different corners of the district in each tahsl. The disease went on unchecked, extending round each centre from one village to the other, and by the end of December the number of villages reached to 19 with 873 cases and 547 deaths.  " At about this time another independent centre in Bet came into existence, and it was the village of Borey Kaln. The infection originated from a village in the Jullundur District. From the above it would appear that the main wave of infection ran into the district from Jullundur side and settled itself at three different points in the Bet, and it; invaded the tahsls of Jagraon and Ludhina. The tahsl of Samrla had already been overtaken from the Patila Territory. Considering the time of the year so favourable for plague these four independent currents of infection were strong enough to overrun the district and devastate it. " Up to this time all the towns remained free, but among the villages the disease had been spreading so fast that by the end of January the number of infected villages rose to 69 and cases and deaths to 3,757 and 2,495 respectively. The progress of the disease went on rising every day, so much so that at the end of April the number of villages swelled up to 588 with 60,646 cases and 44,800 deaths. This was the termination of the  climax  of the disease, and from this stage it began to dwindle down rapidly, and before the end of June the infection was reduced to almost nil.

?52 " The number of deaths per day was very high during the months of March and April, so much so that on the 17th day of March there were 1,984 cases with 1,637 deaths, and in the week ending 29th March we have the record of 7,763 cases with 5,967 deaths." (a). All the five Municipal towns in the district were infected and suffered severely, the aggregate mortality amounting to 7 per cent. of their population. Details are given below :- Name of town. Population. Case. Death. Percentage of death to population. Percentage fatality of attacks. Rekot 10,225 1,331 944 9.23 70.92 Khnna 4,004 618 547 13.66 88 5 Ludhina 48,885 3,080 2,241 4.58 70 92 Machhiwra 5,656 909 550 9.52 58.4 Jagraon 19,871 2,730 2,162 10 77 79.19 Rekot was infected early in January 1902, and remained infected for 15 weeks, - the disease ceasing on April 19th. Muhammadans suffered more than Hinds, as they refused to evacuate, while most of the Hindu population went into camp, though they did not altoge- ther abstain from visiting their houses for daily necessaries. The outbreak in Khanna Town commenced on January 25th, and ceased during the third week in April. The spread of the disease was very rapid, and during the week ending March 1st, 163 cases with 140 deaths occurred. The population were panic-stricken, and with the exception of the Muhammadan quarters the town had a deserted appearance in the latter part of the epidemic. Plague broke out in the Ludhina Town on January 25th. Previous to this 5 imported cases had been discovered and had been promptly dealt with, the patients being segregated and the house they occupied disinfected. For about six weeks the disease was confined to the northern half of the town, princi- pally inhabited by Hinds. At first the progress of the disease was slow, but it increased very rapidly during March, and during the week ending March 29th not less than 472 cases with 317 deaths occurred. After this the number of attacks and deaths declined, and by the end of May the epidemic was particularly at an end, having lasted 18 weeks. The severity of the outbreak varied in different mohallas, those inhabited by Muham- madans suffering most. In one mohalla alone 411 cases and 285 deaths occurred; in another mohalla inhabited by Kashmirs no house escaped, and in some houses as many as six per- sons died. The number of cases among Muhammadans was 1,771 and 1,296 deaths, and among Hinds 996 and 774 deaths. The Plague Medical Officer notes: - " Nearly one-third of Hindu population left the town and went to other places. Several respectable families evacuated and went into vacant bungalows in the Civil Lines and took shelter under canvas and grass huts. Muhammadans neither migrated nor evacuated and remained where they were. " Great difficulties arose in the disposal of Hindu corpses. People were unwilling to carry their dead. Hired carriers had to be employed, and at one time even sick were left to themselves and to die by their own rela- tives. In the case of Mussalmns, on the other hand, feelings of sympathy for sick and dead grew stronger and stronger as the disease became severer and severer. Sick were tended carefully and the dead were given well-attended burials. " One of the many causes that contributed towards the spread of the disease was the constant shifting of families from house to house ; whenever a house became infected its occupants went into another and thence into another, and so on." Machhiwra Town was infected on February 10th, and the disease lasted 17 weeks Of the epidemic in Jagraon Town Dr. Fateh Chand notes :- "The town is the second in size in the district, and its formation differs. The Hindu portion is of pucca buildings and bazrs and is by itself. The Muhammadans occupy ' Agwars.' They are detached mohalls that hem the main town like a horse shoe. Total population is of 19,871 souls. Muhammadans predominate.
?53 infection and progress. " The disease did not break out here in epidemic form till the first week of March. The infection ran into the town from Khnpur on one side, Ludhina on the other, and from the Bet villages on the third. First of all Chamrs were attacked. The course of the disease was very rapid. In four weeks the number of cases swelled up to 665 and deaths to 375, and in the 5th week ending 29th March the cases for the week amounted to 609 and deaths to 397. In the following week cases fell down to 496 and deaths went up to 491, and this was the highest figure ever reached in a week and was too terrible for a town of this size. Luckily soon after that the "decline" set in. Its term was short and abrupt. The plague was over before the middle of May. The total attacks were 2,730 with 2,162 deaths. The percentages of deaths to population and of deaths to cases were 10.77 and 79.19 respectively." Classes and character of the people, their bearing in the presence of the epidemic and attitude towards plague measures. (b)    The  majority of the  population    consists   of   Hindu  agriculturists.    Of 653 infected villages, 371 were inhabited chiefly by Hinds and 292 chiefly by Muhammadans. Bearing in the presence of the epidemic. Hindus were much more disposed to adopt precautionary measures, such as evacuation and the avoidance   of contact with  the  sick, than were Muhammadans. Mr. Silcock writes :- " The first villages attacked were chiefly Hindu, and a state of panic ensued among the Hinds, who in many cases fled abandoning their houses and their sick, and great difficulties were experienced in many quarters in discovering the dead bodies and having them burnt : the cases are not rare where the sick were abandoned by all their friends and relations and the dead bodies were not discovered for 2 or even 3 days and the funeral arrangements had to be carried out by strangers, and in not a few cases Hinds had to be buried and not burnt. It is commonly reported that one of the chief reasons why the Muhammadans, refused to leave their homes was that they had observed these actions of panic among the Hinds and determined that they at any rate would not abandon their sick, and that the first fatwa issued by a Ludhina Maulvi against evacuation had its origin in this feeling. 1 have reason to believe that this report is true : it is unquestionable that the attention and care given by Muhammadans to their sick was remarkable, and it was always a point of honour even at the height of the epidemic to attend the funerals of all friends and relations." Both Hinds and Muhammadans placed greater faith in the dictates of their spiritual advisers than in the counsels of Government officers. Muhammadans accepted only such measures as were advocated in the ' fatwas ' of leading Maulvs, and Hinds were frequently victimized by wandering " Sdhs." With regard to Sdhs, Dr. Fated Chand writes: - " The dodges they played to deceive ignorant villagers were very amusing, and one of them was that they used to take a number of wooden pegs, coloured their tops with red paint, stuck them down into the ground round the village from one gate to the other, burnt fire with frankincense, &c, at the gates, recited certain 'mantras' or verses of their own and performed certain physical distortions. Having done so, they took a goat or a buffalo and painted its forehead and tail, they passed the animal through the streets of the village, and having received their promised presents in coin and kind they quietly decamped with their treasure and never appeared again in that village. The results for the villagers who were innocently deceived turned out disastrous in each case after their return into their houses.    Plague re-appeared with greater violence and carried away its victims in heaps." Flight from infected places was very common.    Dr. Fateh Chand notes : " In villages it became an accepted practice that wherever plague broke out those who had friends elsewhere went over to them with their families loaded in carts with their chattels, &c. In towns the exodus has been a favourite step, to such an extent, that nearly one-third population of Jagraon and about the same of Ludhina left their homes, some migrated to places of pilgrimage, and some to other large towns of the Province, such as Amritsar, Lahore, Delhi and Mooltan. In the case of villages this exodus was one of the most potent causes that helped-the propagation of plague far and wide in the interior of this district." Attitude towards plague measures. Mr. Silcock notes :- " No compulsory measures  of  any  kind  were  attempted   in  the district, and the attitude of the people has been naturally quiescent." The villages opposed segregation  and disinfection, and  these  measures  were  early abandoned.                                    .
?54 Effect of the epidemic. (c)    Mr. Silcock writes :- Effect on the general prosperity of the district. " The effect of the epidemic on  the  towns was  an utter paralysis of trade  for the time being, but this only lasted from about the 1st of March to the 15th of May, and  the effects have not been permanent.    At present a stranger would not be aware that there had. been an epidemic. "In villages the interruption of business or agricultural operations was not very marked : the harvest ripened almost at the height of the epidemic, and the crops were in all instances harvested without any apparent difficulty: in cases in which all the male members of a family had died, the neighbours gave the necessary help. " Considerable difficulty was experienced at several places where the death-rate was high, notably at Jagraon and in a lesser degree at Ludhina, in obtaining cloth for robing the corpses or wood for burning them. All the cloth and wood available were quickly exhausted in the towns and large villages, the shop-keepers and contractors who usually provided these articles had closed their shops and godowns and fled : special arrange- ments had consequently to be made and supplies obtained from other sources. " It is not anticipated by the Tahsldrs and Revenue officials that any difficulty will be experienced in paying the present revenue or in cultivating the ground for the kharif crops. Sowing is in progress all over the district, and no difficulties have been reported. The number of mutations which have been rendered necessary through plague mortality is 8,868. Such a large number undoubtedly must have made very considerable changes in the village life, but it has not been necessary to take any action except with regard to children who were left orphans. These number 1,000 and in all cases arrangements have been made through the nearest relations or (where no relations can be found) through the Zaildrs and Lambardrs for the custody of the personal property and cultivation of the land. State of litigation and crime. " During the months of March and April civil litigation almost ceased.    No one who could possibly avoid it came to Ludhina during those months : the civil institutions for the four months of February to May this year were only 1,886 as against 3,851 in 1901, a decrease of more than 50 per cent. " Crime on the other hand increased very considerably, chiefly in burglaries and thefts from unoccupied houses in the half-deserted villages. The number of offences against property reported during the same four months as attributable to plague is 186. " Under the circumstances it is impossible to take any preventive measures, and it has been almost signally impossible to obtain convictions or to trace the offenders, since in most cases the thefts, &c, were only discovered long after their occurrence when people re-opened their houses. " There are several cases of thieves, who had broken into infected houses, having caught the disease and died." Precautionary measures. (d)    Almost the only measure adopted by the people themselves to prevent outbreaks of plague in infected villages was the adoption of quarantine.    Orders were issued on December 14th to all Lambardrs informing them they were authorised to  detain all strangers outside their villages for 10 days. Mr. Silcock notes: - Village quarantine. u Threes-hundred and  thirty-six  villages  made arrangements   to  exclude  strangers from their limits, and of these 140 escaped plague, while in 196 the efforts made were unsuccessful,. These efforts were however of a very incomplete nature, and in many of the villages though actual strangers were excluded, yet the relations of any resident of the village, fleeing from an infected village were after more or less obstruction allowed in, especially if the person asking admittance happened to be the relation of a Lambardr or other influential person in the village. "The want of union in the village, the ignorance of how far they would have been justified in law in forcibly opposing entrance, the absence of any distinct order from Govern- ment that entrance should be refused, and the absence of any provision for appointing or paying chaukdrs were great obstacles in the way of success. " On the other hand, again there were many villages where during the height of the epidemic there was a regular state of seige and not even a Knngo or a tahsil chaprs could obtain admission.    These villages generally escaped infection." Arrangement for obtaining information. (e)    At first Medical subordinates were sent to infected villages and were required to maintain registers of plague cases and deaths and to submit daily returns to the Civil Sur- geon.  As plague spread, however, the Medical staff was unable to cope with the duty of reporting plague occurrences, which was then arranged for by the Civil authorities. Patwrs were then required to submit daily plague reports. At first these-were submitted to the Civil  Surgeon,  but  in  spite of the entertainment of temporary clerks the office of the Civil
?55 Surgeon broke down under the work of compiling statistics from over 300 daily plague reports. Patwrs then sent their reports to the tahsl Offices, in which tahsl reports were prepared : these were sent daily to the Civil Surgeon, who prepared from these the district daily plague reports. However when the epidemic was at its height, it was impossible to maintain accurate records. Mr. Silcock notes :- " In March during the height of the epidemic the recording and "reporting agencies both broke down, and for a week or 10 days the death figures reported cannot be relied on as exhaustive. When, as was the case in many villages, the Lambardrs were dead, the chaukdrs dead, and the villagers scattered in isolated groups all round the villages, and the Patwrs, who were the reporting agents, afraid to venture outside their own village, it is not to be wondered at that the statistics should be defective. " Cases have been recorded as they were reported, but during March and April it was practically impossible to obtain any sure approximate statement of cases. Even in the town of Ludhina deaths could only be discovered by counting the funerals which passed out of the  octroi posts and by stationing men at the various burying grounds and burning ghts." Evacuation. (f)    With    regard    to   evacuation   the Deputy Commissioner notes :- " Evacuation was the measure generally adopted by Hindu villages. It took place sometimes as soon as rats began to die, but more frequently when several cases had occurred among the inhabitants. This action was very marked during the height and the close of the epidemic : at the commencement the people had no experience and did not believe in the advantages of evacuation. There are numerous instances of fakirs having induced the people to remain in on the ground that they had performed the necessary expiatory ceremonies and that the village was safe ; and other cases in which even villages that had evacuated were induced by these fakirs to return. In all cases the results were disastrous, but the fakir had got his money and vanished. In the end the fakirs were, I understand, unable to obtain any credence. " With Muhammadan villages the case was different. Very few Muhammadan villages went out, and in cases where the villages had a mixed population, when the Hindu inhabitants went out, the Muhammadans remained in and suffered accordingly. " The reason was that the village Mullahs were all strongly opposed to evacuation, and on the strength of a verse in the Qurn proclaimed that any Muhammadan leaving his house would be a ' Kfir '. " This teaching originated, it was understood, with the leading Maulvs of Ludhina Town, but when they were reasoned with well and were shown the harm their teaching had caused, they gave this opinion publicly that the view in question had been misunderstood, and that its real meaning was that people should not abandon their houses and fly to some other villages and so spread the disease, and that it was in no way opposed to people leaving their houses and living outside the village, provided they did not go into the village limits. "' Fatws ' were obtained from these Maulvs and printed and distributed among the Muhammadan villages, and Muhammadan officials were sent to talk to the village Mullahs and people and let them know what the decision of Ludhina was ,on the point. As far as' can be seen at present the difficulty has been overcome and I am informed by influential Muhammadans that when the plague season comes round again all Muhammadan villages will be ready to evacuate." Extent of evacuation and its effects. Mr. Silcock writes :- With regard  to  the  extent  to   which  evacution   was   practised   and   its   effects " Thirty-three villages were evacuated completely when rats began to die, and these all escaped plague. u One hundred and seventy-four villages were evacuated completely, after there had been cases of plague, but many of these did not go out until the disease was well established, and the result was that there were numerous deaths in camp of persons who had become infected before they left the village. The recorded statistics show that in these 174 villages there were 1,184 deaths before evacuation and 3,360 in camp afterwards. "Three hundred and fifty-six villages were partially evacuated, and the recorded deaths in these villages are 29,587 in the village and 8,187 in camp. The word ' partially  must be here taken to mean anything from 1/12th to 2/3rds, and without knowing the actual proportions it is not possible to found any argument either for or against evacuation on the difference in number between those who died in the village and those who died outside. " One hundred and thirty-five villages only, out of the 653 attacked, elected to remain in. The deaths in these villages are reported to be 3,665 only : this works out as 6.10 per cent. only on the population of the villages, a very low percentage when it is considered that the mortality percentage for the whole district is 7.10.
?56 " Out of a total therefore of 698 plague villages, 563 were evacuated, either com- pletely or partially, and as this evacuation was entirely voluntary on the part of the inhabit- ants it appears self-evident that the people fully recognize the benefits of evacuation and are prepared to accept it and utilize it as the chief plague preventive. It is, however, well known that in most of the ' partial evacuations ' and even in some of the 'complete ' the evacuation was as has been already stated during, at any rate, the first half of the epidemic little more than nominal. In a large number of cases the villagers, though they had moved into camp, were continually going backwards and forwards to their houses and even on occasions sleeping there, and it was the invariable custom to take the dying or the dead back to their* houses and prepare them for burial inside the houses. One case, that of the village of Rahwan which showed the most remarkable figures of 32 deaths before evacuation and 301 deaths in camp, I have had specially investigated and I find that all the mortality is to be attributed to the causes above mentioned : the villagers themselves now state that the heavy mortality arose from their own fault, and that they did not know the danger they were incurring. " During the second half of the epidemic villagers were much more careful : they had become aware that if they wanted, when out in camp, to keep free from the disease, they had to cut themselves entirely free from the village or at least from the inside of their- houses. If the present statements of the people are to be believed, there can be little doubt that in case of another epidemic the practice of complete evacuation will be almost univer- sal, and the outside shelters will be more substantially constructed, and a strict guard will be kept to prevent people in camp entering the village. The difficulty of dealing with the cattle during the months of December and January will be the only obstacle, and it will be only temporary. It is, however, a difficulty for which there is no remedy : the people will not during those months keep their cattle out at night, and in many villages there is no cattle shelter except in the dwelling house itself : it is under these circumstances impossible to expect that all intercourse with the village site will be or can be dropped : the only course is to endeavour to make it as slight as possible. " Segregation. (g)    Segregation of sick and contacts was observed in very few instances only,   and then   only   at    the   commencement   of   the epidemic, and  among  Hinds, it was a point of honour with Muhammadans to attend the funerals of all friends and relations. Treatment. (h)    With regard to medical treatment, Dr. Fateh Chand writes :- Nearly everywhere people preferred their own hakm and other natives, and through- out the epidemic European method of treat- ment was not asked for." Disinfection. (i)    With regard to chemical  disinfection Mr. Silcock writes :- " The main feature of the treatment of the epidemic in this district may be said to have been the almost entire absence of disinfection as far as villages were concerned and its entire uselessness in towns. I do not know what may have been the results in other dis- tricts, but here it is held to be proved that the use of chemical disinfectants is only a waste of time and money. No villagers asked for disinfectants or would have anything to say to it in any shape or form. " Disinfection has clearly no effect in lessening the mortality or shortening the duration of the epidemic, and these two defects combined with the strong objection to it manifested by the people, are in my opinion quite sufficient to cause it to be classed among the measures that should not be taken in case of recrudescence of the disease. " It would in fact appear to be fairly well established that during the virulent stage of the disease it is dangerous to re-occupy a house, no matter how it has been disinfected ; while after the virulent stage is passed, re-occupation after the very simplest disinfection is accom- panied with very little danger. This is really what is held to be in the district the conclu- sive argument against chemical disinfection. " These remarks are borne out by the Civil Surgeon who, although he states that he believes in the efficacy of chemical disinfection to destroy the infection of plague, holds that it is of little use when carried out under the conditions which prevailed in the Ludhina District. Speaking of the attitude of the people towards the measure Dr. Fateh Chand writes :- " They made every attempt in their power to destroy the efficacy of disinfection. They did not allow all the effects of their rooms to be disinfected either with mercury or with phenyle, nor they were willing to sufficiently expose the articles to sun before being restored to their places. The other bugbears in the case of houses were granaries, and in the case of effects, valuable clothes, woollen and silken. The other block people raised against disfection was the eagerness to get back into their houses immediately the gang has walked out. They would not listen to any reasons, and the result was that the houses were re-infected and had to be re-disinfected more than once. This involved waste of time and money on the one side .and disbelief in disinfection on the part of the people on the other."                                                                                             .                                -
?57  Chemical disinfection when adopted was carried out according to the instructions contained in the Memorandum on Disinfection. A disinfecting gang was obtained from the Central Disinfection Dept, Jullundur City, and placed in charge of a Hospital Assistant. Dholewl, the first village to be infected, was chemically disinfected under the supervision of the Civil Surgeon, and the infected houses in two neighbouring villages were also disin- fected, but in consequence of the opposition of the people to the measure chemical disinfec- tion was abandoned in villages. Chemical disinfection was, however, carried out to a certain extent in all Municipal towns except Mchiwra. For reasons already referred to, however, it was not very efficacious. The number of houses and rooms disinfected in towns and cost of chemicals and appliances used is shewn below :- Name of town. Number of  houses disin- fected. Number of  rooms disin- fected.

Popular methods. The only methods of disinfection adopted by the people themselves were the burning of big fires in infected rooms and white- washing their houses before re-occupying them. These measures were only adopted in a comparatively few instances. Inoculation. (j) Thirty-one thousand five hundred and twelve inoculations were performed in the Ludhina District during the year under report. Of these 18,075 were performed in the Ludhina Tahsl, 7,315 in the Jagraon and 6,122 in the Samrla Tahsl. Inoculation operations were not commenced until February 1902. A distinction is made between the inoculations performed before and after April 16th. In the first period inoculations were limited to the town of Ludhina and of it Dr. Fateh Chand notes:- " The total number done in the period was 10,646, and these operations were performed by the Civil Surgeon and the Assistant Surgeon of the Civil Hospital. Plague was at its ascendency at the time and people were in great alarm. The townspeople took to it kindly in the beginning. They were nearly all Hinds. Their eagerness for it was so much that after the work of the afternoon used to be over the Civil Surgeon was invited to private houses where women and children of the street gathered and got themselves inoculated. This state went on for a few days. The number of volunteers from the town began to decrease, but flocks of villagers poured in from all sides and from villages far and near and demanded prompt inoculation. Their zeal was so great at the time that every one wanted to be operated before the other, and they fought their way out to the table. Altogether people of 177 villages in various numbers were inoculated in this period." After April 16th four inoculation parties were formed " to itinerate through the whole district and bringing inoculation to the doors of the people." In this period 17,568 inocula- tions were performed. Until about the middle of May, i. e. as long as plague was epidemic, there was considerable willingness to submit to inoculation, but afterwards the attitude of the people altered and the inoculation parties then met with little success. The Deputy Commissioner writes :- " The great object aimed at during the present inoculation campaign has been to have if possible several people at least inoculated now in every village in the district, to act as living examples afterwards of the absence of risk in the operation. This has been practi- cally accomplished now, and there is hardly a village, however distant, in which some half dozen or so of men at least have not been inoculated. " The timidity among the villagers is however still very great : in one group of villages operations were entirely put a stop to, because a Patwri who came forward to be inoculated in order to show to his village that there was no danger, was seized with a sudden faintness
?58 after the operation and remained unconscious for several hours. The same thing occurred in another group of villages where a Zaildr, who had been inoculated and who had asked for some lotion for his arm, had pure carbolic acid applied by a Compounder by mistake ; the arm swelled up to an extroardinary size ; the people took fright, and there was naturally no more inoculation in that neighbourhood." The Civil Surgeon states that the general attitude of the Hinds has been throughout for inoculation both during the epidemic and after subsidence. In the latter period, however, they sometimes declined inoculation on the grounds that they were too busy with their harvest or that the weather was too warm or that the effects of inoculation only last for six months ; they would come for it when winter commences. With  regard to  Muhammadans the  Deputy  Commissioner notes :- " As with evacuation so with inoculations, the Muhammadans have been found the most difficult to deal with. Their opposition in this case does not appear to arise so much from any religious prohibition as from a stolid unreasoning objection to any precautionary measures against what they regard as a heaven-sent pestilence or punishment." The Muhammadan population of the Bet were particularly averse to inoculation, and some of the leading Maulvs of Ludhina Town had themselves and their families inoculated with the hope of overcoming the prejudices of the poorer classes. Some of the objections were due to false rumours as to its harmful effects. These rumours were these,-inoculation robs one of the sexual powers, affects his eyesight, and gives him unusual sensations of the heart. Results of inoculation. From what has been mentioned with regard to the  reporting  of plague occurrences, it will be evident that the results of inoculation are but imperfectly ascertained. Among the 10,646 persons inoculated during the course of the epidemic 70 persons were reported to have been attacked with plague of whom 52 died-a case mortality of 74.29 per cent., which is higher than that of the district which on the whole, is 7276 per cent. The Civil Surgeon states that many of those inoculated who contracted plague were attacked within a few days of the operation when they were probably already incubating the disease. From the figures given and from considerations already mentioned it would appear likely that many attacks of plague among inoculated were not brought to light. With regard to the prospects of the extensive adoption of inoculation  by the people, Mr. Silcock writes : - " Judging by their present attitude, I do not think there is any ground for expecting that the people of this district will come forward in any numbers for inoculation during the autumn or winter months: this opinion is shared by all persons whom I have consulted on the subject. Inoculation, causing as it does high fever and a general disturbance of the system, is naturally disliked by every one, and I do not think that this dislike will be overcome, until the danger is very imminent, until in fact the epidemic is well established. The choice of the villagers will lie between evacuation and inoculation, and as matters are at present, that choice will be overwhelmingly in favour of evacuation." Infection. (k)    From what has been stated in reviewing the. course of the epidemic it  will have been seen that the infection of plague was intro- duced into the Ludhina District, there having been a history of direct personal infection in them of the four first " foci " of the disease. On the subject of infection the Deputy Commissioner, who in his remarks confirms those of the Civil Surgeon, writes : - " The cause of infection has been enquired into in each of the 653 villages affected, and it has practically in all cases been easily traced to human agency : there is generally a history of some one having gone to an infected village to visit sick relations or transact business and of his or her having brought back the disease with them or on the other hand a history of refugees from infected villages having been allowed admission." Mr. Silcock proceeds to say:- " There is no history of the disease having been conveyed in articles of food or merchandise, but when it is seen that in 563 villages, out of the 653 affected, rats died first (i.e., before any case occurred) and that in many instances the persons who are charged ' with bringing the disease were not attacked themselves, it appears to be amply proved the disease is conveyed not in the body but' in or on clothes or some other medium. A notable case of infection by clothes occurred in the Jagraon Tahsl where in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to keep out the disease from the tahsl (an isolated building two miles from the town) rats began to die and the tahsl had to be immediately vacated. It was found on investigation that a Police Sergeant, whose wife had died of plague a month or so before, had brought some of her clothes in his box and had taken them out to air. No case of plague among human beings occurred, but there is little doubt that the place had become infected."
?59 With regard, however, to the remark that "as rats died first it appears to be amply proved that the disease is conveyed not in the body but in or on clothes or some other medium," reference may be made to what has been stated in a previous part of this report that it seems likely that in many cases in which mortality among rats has appeared before outbreaks of plague among human beings, the disease has actually been introduced in the person of some human being whose attack of plague was either unrecognized or was not brought to light. Mr. Silcock considers that the only theory that would appear to fit all the facts of conveyance is infection by fleas and advocates a more thorough investigation into the facts connected with it. He holds this opinion, however, on the supposition that the " microbe cannot be kept alive on clothes for more than 7 or 8 days "-a supposition, however, which has little evidence in its support. Both   Dr. Fateh  Chand  and  Mr. Silcock  call  attention  to the mild case of plague which occur during the hot weather.    The latter notes :- " I think it desirable to call attention to the fact that although the district is now free from official plague, it is not free from a modified form of it. There are a number of cases through the district where buboes are occurring without any fever or other symptoms of plague and where the patients (if they can be called so) go about their work without any inconvenience. There appears little reason to doubt that this is real plague in a very diluted form and that it is one of the ways in which the disease is kept alive in villages during the autumn and winter months." Although mention is made of the occurrences in the large number of villages of rat mortality before outbreak of plague among human beings, no instance is recorded of the actual conveyance of infection of plague from one village to another by rats. The evidence that rats are largely disseminators of plague in villages already infected is very great. This will appear from what is mentioned below with reference to rat mortality. (l)    With regard to mortality among Plague among rats and other animals. rats the Deputy Commissioner notes :- " In 14 villages, although rats died of plague, the  village site was not evacuated and no plague occurred among human beings. '' In 33 other villages  rats died, the village was  evacuated, and no case  of  plague. occurred. " In 563 plague-stricken villages rats died before any case occurred among men. " In only 88 villages, out of the total 698 affected, did cases occur among human be- ings before it was observed among rats. " There was an appreciable interval in most cases between the death of rats and the outbreak of plague : all through the district in fact the death of rats acted as the danger signal : those who took the warning escaped ; those who waited generally got plague." Dr. Fateh Chand remarks :- " The connection of the rats dying prior to plague outbreaks has been so recognised. in the district that it is looked upon as a sure  ' pilot '   of plague epidemic in a locality." Dr. Fateh Chand also .notes :- " The death of rats in plague-stricken villages has been nearly absolute. They dis- appeared from every village while plague still existed in them. This shows that plague is much more fatal to them. In many villages they have not yet re-appeared, and in those where they have re-appeared the period of absence after subsidence of plague has been- as long as three months or so." He also notes that where rats re-appear they are all ' youngsters.' As regards measures for the destruction of rats, the Civil Surgeon notes:- " No particular step was taken to catch and destroy rats. The general feeling to such an undertaking shall now be considered unjustifiable by the people, as they have recognised the value of their presence, and look upon their death as a sure message of the onset of plague and would be at a loss in the event of their absence."  With regard to plague among other animals, Dr. Fateh Chand states that he has himself seen squirrels suffering. He states that they were paralyzed in the posterior half of the body.    In  some places they died after plague had been some time among the people. The deaths of cats and dogs were noticed in some badly infected villages, these deaths being attributed to their having eaten rats that died of plague,
?6o Dr. Fateh Chand adds :- " It is also rumoured that sheep and goats, as well as cows and buffaloes, suffered from big suppurating lumps in their necks during the epidemic in some villages. Personally I have not seen any case of this kind." Mr. Silcock quotes this attitude of the people as one argument against any general campaign against rats. It should, however, be mentioned that but for the outbreak among rats, it seems likely that many villages might have escaped epidemic of plague, or would have at any rate suffer- ed less severely than they did. Type and severity ef the disease. (m)    The  severity  of the   epidemic  in  the   Ludhina  District  has  already been mentioned.                    The case mortality has been shown as 72.76 per cent., and if it be argued that this apparently high rate of mortality is due to imperfect reporting of cases it only shows that the people suffered more than has been recorded. The Civil Surgeon notes that the percentage of deaths to the census population was 7.1 and to the population of infected villages 9.26. He also gives the following table showing the percentage of death to the population of the infected villages :- In 274 villages the mortality was under 5 per cent. " 149  above   5 per cent. and under 10 per cent.      " 125  " 10 " " 15 " " 64  " 15 " " 20 " " 33  " 20 " " 25 " " 4 " " 25 " " 30 " " 3 " " 3 " " 35 " " 1 " " 40 " " 45 " The proportion of deaths to the population of each tahsl was as below :-       Per cent. Samrla  ...   ...    ...     ...   8.2 Ludhina ...   ...    ...     ...   6.9 Jagraon  ...   ...    ...     ...   6.3 The Deputy Commissioner remarks that the mortality of each tahsl corresponds with the order in which it became infected. The mortality in towns has already been given. Dr. Fateh Chand states that the bubonic type of plague prevailed throughout the epidemic, but that at its commencement cases of septic and pneumonic plague were frequently- observed. Neither of these forms were recognised at first by the people or their hakims as being plague, nor would they accept the diagnosis of Medical Officers, but accused them of being " manufacturers" of plague, for the septicimus form of plague was attributed to fever and then the pneumonic form to ordinary pneumoni. Referring to the latter type Dr. Fateh Chand notes :- " A very interesting feature in regard to pneumonic variety has been noticed that, in spite of its being highly infectious, it remained confined to three or four families in a street in villages where it made its appearance. Those families were swept away in whole, and no more cases of this nature were heard of thereafter." The number of cases of the different types of plague and the frequency with which buboes occurred in different positions are given in Statement No. 5 (Appendix A). Classes attacked. (n)    The poor classes-village menials-suffered most 9.9 per cent,  of these  classes    of the  population   having   died   of   plague.                                               Next came the Muhammadans, of whom 7.87 died, and lastly Hinds with a mortality of 6-71 per cent. The Civil Surgeon notes :- " Of the minor sections of community, 'Lohrs', ' Tarkhns,' 'Jhnwars ' and 'Chamrs ' fell victims to the disease more than other classes. This also is due to the theory of exposure to infection. In a village every one has something to do with his ' Tarkhn ' and ' Lohr.' In the same way it is ' Jhnwar ' and  'Chamr ' that has to serve and go to every one's house." Women of all classes suffered more than men. This is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the circumstance that they stay in doors more than either men or children, attend to the sick and pay visits of condolence, and are thus more exposed to infection.
?61 The greatest number of deaths occurred in persons between 20 and 50 years, thus forming the majority of the population ; the case mortality of these cases was 69.2 per cent. Although attacks among persons over 60 were comparatively few, the fatality of their attacks are very high, 87.7 per cent. Very few infants under one year were attacked, and this coupled with the fact that they are much exposed to infection through their mothers leads Dr. Fateh Chand to the conclusion that " if there is any degree of immunity from plague at any age, it is in infants." Unusual features. Treatment. No unusual features of the plague were noticed, nor were any methods  of treatment found to be especially favourable. The treat- ment adopted by hakims consisted chiefly of the application of leeches to buboes or horn cuppings and scarifications  with or without the application of heat, usually in the form of hot bricks.  Recommendations. (o)    The    Deputy      Commissioner     notes :- " The suggestions that I would make for the treatment of another  epidemic are the following :- (1)  That all villages be directed to impose quarantine on approach of the disease, and that every assistance be  given  them  to  render  it  effective by the appointment of extra chaukdrs and by utilizing the provisions of Section 269, Indian Penal Code. (2)  That minor Municipalities which differ very slightly from villages be  allowed  to impose a similar quarantine. (3)  That no attempts at segregation or chemical disinfection be made in either towns or villages. (4)  That when plague has invaded a village, every inducement be offered to  effect a complete evacuation and every assistance be given through appointment of extra chaukdrs to guard the village entrances, and through the provision of shelter in camp for  the  poorer portion of the population either from the village malba or a Government grant. (5)  That in case of any portion of the village declining to evacuate,  the  pay  of the extra chaukdrs be realized from such portion alone. (6)  That  all arrangements regarding reporting deaths, quarantine and evacuation be left in the hands of the revenue authorities alone. (7)  That if the Medical authorities can certify that any person inoculated  may  with- reasonable safety remain in an infected village,   inoculation  be  pressed  during the  winter months. (8)  That if they cannot so certify, inoculation be not attempted." He is supported by the Civil Surgeon with regard to Nos. (1), (2) and (4) of these suggestions. Dr. Fateh Chand also recommends that persons who do exceptionally good services in the cause of inoculation should be rewarded substantially, and that it should be the duty of every Zaildr to persuade people to accept inoculation. Mr. Silcock followed up the recommendation made in his report by a letter to the -Commissioner of the Jullundur Division, No. 272, dated Ludhina, July 11th-15th, 1902, of which certain portions are reproduced below as being of interest or  importance :- " * * * with the exception of a few attempts at disinfection, plague camps, &c., made 'at the commencement, the disease was allowed to pursue its natural course unchecked. The people were given the best advice available and were then left to follow the bent of their .own inclinations as to how far they would follow it. " It may therefore be accepted that this district affords an almost complete object lesson of the course which the epidemic, if unchecked by any action on the part of Govern- ment, will follow, and of the extent to which it will spread. " The price paid for this lesson however has been 50,000 lives, and I hardly think that Government can afford to pay so heavy a price a second time. It is often said that the death-rate of plague is not so very exceptional when compared with that of malarial fevers, but I have examined the fever figures for the autumn of 1900, which is held here to have been the worst year in the memory of the present generation, and I find the total deaths during the four months from September to December to have been 18,559. It is therefore very clear that there is no comparison between the mortalities from these two diseases ; and that plague which has almost decimated the population of this district in three months can hardly, with safety, be allowed to follow its course unchecked. Some action is certainly called for, and the only question can be as to the direction in which it should be taken,
?62 " Compulsory measures of any kind are of course out of the question:  the disease is now so widespread that, even if such measures were advisable, it would be impossible to enforce them. The only method, therefore, by which we can hope to restrict or moderate the epidemic, is by helping the people to take their own measures against it and by directing their efforts into the proper channels ; it is not sufficient to only tell them what to do. village communities are so split up by factions, intrigues and personal malices, that it is useless to expect even a large majority in any village to be able to impose its will on all the residents, unless there is some sanction of law or executive authority behind it. The people at the height of the epidemic were thoroughly frightened and were ready to adopt almost any" measures that appeared likely to give them a chance of escape, but in only rare instances were they able to carry them out with that unanimity and completeness which was required for success           * * *. " There are admittedly only 4 known ways of dealing with plague-(1) quarantine; (2) evacuation ;   (3) disinfection, either with or without evacuation ; and (4) inoculation. "Now the village communities are strongly in favour of quarantine, are ready to accept evacuation as a necessary evil, will have nothing to say to disinfection in any shape or form, and thoroughly dislike inoculation : this at any rate is the state of feeling in this district. " It would appear to follow therefore that if efforts are to be made to help the people to help themselves, they can be only or mainly in the direction of quarantine and evacuation. As to chemical disinfection it has been thoroughly discredited in the past epidemic; the people have always been opposed to it, and now I think that even the Civil Surgeon and the Medical subordinates, who had the practical management of it in the epidemic have lost faith in it.                    " It is somewhat difficult of course to get rid of one's prejudice in its favour, but the facts observed in the past six months here would seem to prove its uselessness.                *          *             *           *              *               *                  *               *                                                                           " I am therefore strongly opposed to chemical disinfection at any stage of the epidemic. " Inoculation stands on a  different footing, but the experience of the last three months, i. e. since the inoculation campaign started in this district in April, does not lead one to be very hopeful regarding it. The people, while in a state of panic, will welcome almost anything which seems likely to act as a preventive and numbers came forward in April while the disease was still raging, but during May and June, when it was on the wane, the numbers grew less and less, until there is now practically not only no demand for it, but no willingness to submit to it. " It may be accepted that if plague breaks out again with equal virulence, there will be a demand for inoculation in next March and April, but I very much doubt there being any willingness to accept it during the autumn and winter months. The disease in other words will have to become epidemic before inoculation will be generally accepted, and "therefore it can hardly be held to be a means of preventing its spreading. " There only remain then the 2 measures, quarantine and evacuation, and it is princi- pally with a view to have these rendered efficient that I write. "According to the present Plague Rules any village can impose a 10 days' quarantine, and according to the present law any one evading or forcing the quarantine guard can be punished under Section 269, Indian Penal Code," but the villages were provided with no machinery for enforcing quarantine, and orders were received that no prosecution under Section 269 should be instituted without sanction of superior authority. " It is needless under the circumstances to say that in only a small proportion of vil- lages was quarantine effectual. As a matter of fact 336 villages made quarantine arrange- ments and out of that number only 140 succeeded in keeping plague out, but the fact that 140 villages did succeed in keeping it out is of considerable importance. " There is no necessity to take the arrangements out of the hands of the villagers themselves, or to compel any village to set up quarantine if it did not wish to do so, but there can be no harm in (1) letting it be known by proclamation, &c, that Government strong- ly approves (if this is the case) of it, and wishes each village to make arrangements for it ; (2) allowing the Lambardrs to appoint and pay out of the chaukdri cess so many extra chaukdrs as may be required for effectual quarantine ; and (3) letting it be known that the Lambardrs will be supported, and that any person evading or forcing the quarantine will be severely punished under Section 269, Indian Penal Code. '' These are the measures I would suggest as to quarantine. " Evacuation  is  regarded by the villagers as the only remedy when plague has suc- ceeded in entering the village, and if the obstacles in its way were removed,  would  be  very . largely availed of.
?63 " Of the 653 villages attacked by plague in the last epidemic, 174 evacuated com- pletely and 353 partially. This action was perfectly voluntary, and it is therefore clear that there is a strong feeling among the people in favour of evacuation. " The obstacles in its way are- (1)  The great difficulty the village communities find,  when  left  to  themselves,   of coming to any unanimous decision about anything. (2)  The knowledge among those who wish to go out that the disease will continue among those that stay in, and that therefore they may be kept  out in  camp indefinitely. (3)  The difficulty of disposing of their valuables, clothes, house furniture, &c., out in camp. (4)  The strong objection to  leaving their  houses,  with  their grain, fodder, &c., unguarded and in case of only partial evacuation at the mercy of those  who stay in. (5)  The difficulty among the poorer classes of obtaining shelter outside or of follow- ing their various occupations. " These are the objections raised by the people themselves, and they are, I think, to a great extent well founded, but I have little doubt that a little pressure and a little assistance would overcome most of them. " The difficulty about valuables, &c., in camp is a very slight one : as a matter of fact the people have arranged about them in the past and can do so again, and there have been very few cases of thefts of valuables out in camp, while thefts in abandoned houses have been very numerous. " To protect unoccupied houses a number of extra chaukdrs might be appointed and paid from the cess : this will be fairly effectual in case of villages wholly evacuated, but will not be so in cases of those only partially evacuated. In the case of the latter undoubtedly a large number of chaukdrs would be required, and to provide their pay and at the same time to put pressure on those who remained behind to go out, I would propose that the pay of these extra chaukdrs be furnished by those only who refuse to go out. " The difficulty of providing shelter for the poorer classes can only be met by requiring the Lambardrs to provide it at the cost of the village malba or by Government making a grant for the purpose. " In a large number of villages during the last epidemic no difficulty was found, and in a certain number the richer classes provided materials, but there are a considerable number of villages in certain parts of the district where materials (such as thatching grass, chari or timber) are not available, and supplies would require to be sent from other villages. " Considerable difficulty would probably be experienced in preventing peculation if Government made a grant, but the difficulty is not insuperable, and I have little hesitation in saying that something in this direction should be done."

The Ferozepore District was declared to be infected on January 30th, 1902, when an outbreak of plague was discovered in a Review of epidemic                                   village of Badnal of 2,000' inhabitants in the Zra Tahsl. There is no doubt, however, that infection had been introduced some time pre- viously, as by the date mentioned 22 deaths had occurred. Badnal became the source of infection of a larger number of villages in the neighbour- hood. On March 14th a new centre of infection in the Zra Tahsl was established at Malsin, a village of 1,038 inhabitants, near the head-quarters of the tahsil. The Zra Tahsl remained-infected until July 26th, 1902. There were outbreaks of plague in 30 villages : 3,489 plague cases and 2,538 deaths occurred. The Moga Tahsl also became infected during January 1902. Plague having broken out at the village of Ajatwl on January 25th, the outbreak was not reported however until February 12th. A severe epidemic of plague followed which, though it died during the hot weather, had not ceased by the end of the year under report. Sixty villages were infected and 6,796 cases-of plague with 3,792 deaths occurred. Four of the above villages were situated in the Mnjha ilqa in which 163 cases with 72 deaths occurred.
?64 Two imported cases of plague occurred in Ferozepore City on April 3rd, 1902 : these were followed by some indigenous cases. Owing, however, to prompt measures the disease did not become epidemic, though dropping cases occurred throughout the remainder of the year under report. Altogether 22 cases with 12 deaths occurred. The progress of the disease, week by week, is shown in the table below :- Table showing the Course of the Epidemic of Plague in the Ferozepore District weekly from the beginning of October 1901 to the end of September 1902.

The highest number of deaths recorded in any week occurred in that ending April 12th and numbered 736.
?65 The epidemic rapidly declined after the middle of May, and in July only 15 cases Were recorded. No village became infected during August, but three were infected during September with 25 cases and 11 deaths. The incidence and fatality of plague varied greatly in different villages : details of certain villages are given in the table below. It will be seen that in several villages over a quarter of the inhabitants were attacked with plague. One village, Talwandi Malyn, lost a quarter of its population from this disease :- Table showing Particulars concerning certain villages in which Outbreaks of Plague were severe.

(a). The population of the infected tahsls consists principally of Jts and Sikhs, a very suspicious and conservative people, not to be driven, though trustful where the confi- dence has been gained. Their attitude in the the presence of the epidemic was one of sullen resignation. At first all classes were absolutely determined not to accept any of the measures recommended by Government. The Jt Sikhs were convinced that their great physical strength safely guarded them against plague, and it was not until they became thoroughly scared at the mortality amongst them that anything could be done with them. Mr. Levi notes : " The Jt Sikh, however, did observe the precaution of not hanging around funeral pyres, but the Musalmns all through crowded around their corpses with customary fanaticism." The leading men behaved very differently in different villages. A few appreciated the facts that Government was working for the benefit of the people, while a certain number were actively opposed to plague measures. As a rule there was no panic in infected villages, the sick were properly attended to, and the dead promptly disposed of. In the village of Talwandi Malyn, however, which has already been referred to, the people lost their heads and did not make proper arrange- ments for the disposal of their dead. Corpses were left about the village and were eaten by dogs, with the result that the dogs also died. Contrary to the experience of most other districts the attitude of the trading classes in the Ferozepore District was satisfactory. Mr. Miller, the Deputy Commissioner, writes :- It is pleasing to think that Arors and Baniys have done good work during the last cold weather. The Zra shop-keeping community are specially to be commended. This kept plague out of the place altogether."
?66 (b). With regard to the effect of the epidemic on trade, agriculture, &c., Mr. Levi notes :- Effects on trade, &c.  " The outbreak was not of sufficiently long duration, nor sufficiently widespread to very severely affect trade agricultures or the  labour market. Orphans were on the whole fairly well looked after, many having property owing to the deaths of their parents. In some cases in which it was feared that they might be neglected, they were periodically weighed before the Plague Executive Officers." There was an increase in crime. Mr. Levi notes :- " Thefts were very numerous from evacuated houses, and owing to the fact that they were as a rule discovered some time afterwards were almost impossible of detection. If one party in a village refused to evacuate, it generally spent its time in looting the houses of those who had gone out. In one village this was varied by the practice of setting their houses on fire. In all such cases detection and conviction is difficult, as the actual eye witnesses are necessarily partisans of the perpetrators." Precautionary measures. (c). In many villages an attempt was made to exclude strangers, in some excellent watch was kept, and these, though in the centre  of the infected area, escaped scatheless. The difficulty of maintaining such watch and ward is commented on both by the Plague Medical Officer and the Executive Plague Officer. The former writes: " People of one village often visited infected places where they had relations and by this means brought in the infection"; and the latter remarks : " It is a difficult business and can only be carried out by Lambardrs of great influence who don't mind being unpleasant to their neighbours." Mr. Millar writes : - " It is, however, very difficult to keep out women from villages. As has often happened a woman lost her husband by plague in Ludhina District and came to her relations in Moga Tahsl. To the credit of many villages it can be said that regular segregation was insisted on. The woman was kept outside the village for a week or so. This sort of thing should be encouraged." Methods of obtaining information regarding plague occurrences. (d). Village Lambardrs and Chaukdrs  were responsible for reporting plague cases and deaths to the Patwrs who maintained registers and submitted them through the Tahsildrs. With regard to the records of plague occurrences Mr. Levi writes :- " I believe all deaths to have been faithfully reported, but cases in which patients recovered were undoubtedly suppressed. This has been especially the case in May and June when every village has been anxious to show a clean sheet ; thus the case mortality for June is quite unreliable, and, had all non-fatal cases been reported, would probably have been under 30 per cent." Evacuation.  (e). In the beginning of the epidemic evacuation was the measure against which the people most absolutely set their force.  Mr. Levi writes :- "They were firmly convinced that once they evacuated, their village would be invaded by a host of plague officials, and they would not be allowed to go back to their villages for at least six months. The more it was explained to them that they would remain their own masters in the matter, the more suspicious they became. However, when once a start had been made, most villages evacuated to a greater or less extent, and with the exception of Talwandi Malyn; Baddowl and Himmatpura and Rajina, there was in the end no village some of whose members did not evacuate. " As to evacuation, without going into the history of the outbreak in every village, it is impossible to define the extent to which it was carried out. In some villages a few houses only made a pretence of moving out and kept up continual intercourse with the infected site, and in others, on the first death, the whole population moved out bodily, appointed a watchman or two, and never came back till the outbreak had subsided and the village had been chemically disinfected. Between these two extremes every gradation was observable:  it is not even possible to classify villages in order, as in some all the people evacuated in a half-hearted manner, and in others one section retired to the fields and cut off its con- nection with the remainder who stopped in and died. The effect of the population going out was a marked decrease of the disease. The happiest results were obtained by a village or patti which went out at once and stopped out, in which case in general the disease was confined to their more foolish brethern who stopped in. " It may now be confidently stated that the inhabitants of both tahsls are now convinced of the efficacy of evacuation, and in future if they do not adopt it, it will be only because of mutual jealousies or fear of thefts from the abandoned houses."
?67 Cordon and guards. (f).  On the subject of guards, Dr. Mahoney writes :- " In some instances where villages were evacuated, or partly evacuated, a system of watchmen were appointed by the Lambardrs and Zaildars to guard the property of these people, yet a considerable amount of property was stolen which had a deterring effect." Segregation. (g). Segregation of the sick was only carried out in few instances in the early part of the epidemic when Mr. Levi remarks : " It was often most effectual. When plague spread this measure was abandoned, partial and complete evacuation of village being adopted. in its place." Medical treatment. (h). The people preferred the treatment of their hakims to that of Government Medical Officers. Only 3 persons applied for European medical treatment. (i). But little disinfection was performed in the Ferozepore District. On this subject Mr. Levi writes as follows :- Disinfection " No disinfection of any sort has been carried out except by official agency with the prescribed solution. A gang of disinfectors numbering 54 was kept up at Dharamkot, and the rules of Government were strictly observed, that disinfection was to be regarded as a benefit to be conferred ; in all cases a written application was received before any opera- tions were commenced. The gang was regarded with the greatest suspicion, and it is a firm article of faith with the zamindrs that when plague is over and done with, the cost of disinfection will be collected from each village with the revenue. The operations per- formed were of two kinds-(i) disinfection of a few houses in an early stage accompanied with evacuation of those houses; and (ii) total disinfection accompanied with complete evacuation. There were many operations of the first sort, and if evacuation was prompt they were nearly always successful. Such disinfection was only carried out in villages in which the people were doing their best to keep out the plague-infected and in which a case had slipped in by defeating their vigilance. Complete disinfection was carried out in 10 villages. In all cases the population had completely evacuated, and in most cases operations were deferred till the outbreak had practically subsided, in order to prevent possible re-occu- pation before the disease had died out. All those villages remained free, and none of them have yet been re-infected. The greatest care was taken in each case that no opportunity could arise for the disinfection gang to annoy the villagers, and there is reason to hope that the suspicion with which official disinfection was regarded has in those villages and surrounding villages been allayed ; and that this measure will be largely sought in the future." Details as to the number of houses desinfected and the staff employed in connection with this measure will be found in Statement No. 10, Appendix C. No mention is made either in the Plague Medical Officer's or the Executive Plague Officer's Report of the disin- fection of clothing and other Personal effects. Inoculation. (i). Owing to insufficient Medical staff it was not possible to commence inocu- lations until the end of April. Mention has been made in a previous report of the inoculations performed in May '90', when a few persons from a large number of villages were inoculated in order to serve as examples. This appears to have obtained its object, for by the end of July, i.e., during the remainder of the epidemic, 15,830 persons were inoculated. Particulars are given in State- ment No. 6 (Appendix B). Both Dr. Mahoney and Mr. Levi refer to the rumour and alarming stories that were current about the effects of inoculation. Dr. Mahoney states that stories were spread by mischievous persons that a great many people died from inoculation, and Mr. Levi notes that it was fairly believed that cost of inoculation was subsequently to be recovered ; the difficulty caused by this belief was to a certain extent overcome by making the certificates ' free.' Dr. Mahoney remarks that the people had no social or religious objection to the measure, but that they evinced considerable interest in it, asking how the fluid was prepared, how it acted, and so forth. In villages where the measure was new a few women and children were at first put forward to undergo the operation and when satisfied as to its effect others came forward for inoculation. The inhabitants of different villages also made inquiry of each other as to the result of the measure, and as these were satisfactory the people began to accept inoculation freely. During the subsidence of the epidemic, when the weather was very hot, the people com- plained that inoculation produced high fever.
?63 However 4,539 inoculations were performed in August and 7,323 in September, bring- ing the total number of inoculations performed during the year under report to 27,892. As inoculation operations were carried out from the most part after the subsidence of plague or in uninfected villages, conditions do not exist for estimating the extent of the immunity conferred by it. Only 5 cases of plague among inoculated persons were re- ported, all but one of which recovered. With reference to the future prospects of. inoculation Mr. Levi notes :- Prospects  in the autumn. " With regard to prospects  of inoculation in the autumn,   they may be considered  to be very favourable * * *. But there is no doubt all inoculations  in   the Zra and Moga Tahsls should be done  by  an European.    The people will never consent to any other arrangement; and the mere  presence of a native  inoculator makes  the people hang back altogether." Infection. (k). Where obtainable, information almost invariably pointed to the infection of vil- lages by human agency either by refugees from infected villages or by residents of uninfected villages contracting the disease when visiting relatives and introducing it into their own villages on their return. The introduction by infection of clothes from infected villages was also recorded. Infection was brought into the village of Badowl and Ajatwl, the first to be infected in the Zra and Moga Tahsls respectively by refugees from Ludhina. It is stated that  infection was deliberately  introduced  into  some  villages  by  their neighbours. Mr. Levi writes :- " A large number of villages were infected from the village of Badowl. The Lam- bardrs of this village, who are peculiarly unscrupulous, had lately wronged a certain fakir in the matter of some land, and plague, when it broke out there, was universally attributed to this cause. To remove the stigma of this and to show that the disease was due to other causes the Lambardrs organised a campaign of infection of clean villages. In this way they succeeded in infecting at least ten villages and probably more, generally by nocturnal visits." Dr. Mahoney suggests the probability of infection through grain.    He writes :- " The Banis and grain-dealers were also often the means of carrying the infection by importing infected grain and other produce from other villages where it was often sold at half  or less than  the ordinary market  price." It is possible however as the grain was brought from infected villages the persons bringing it may  have themselves carried infection. Although rat mortality was very common, no reference is made of rats having either introduced the infection of plague into villages or spread the disease within infected villages. The Plague Medical Officer, however, suggests that plague was sometimes introduced into houses by  dogs and  cats which had eaten  infected rats. Influence of local conditions. (l).    No  reference  is    made  to  the  influence    of the climate, soil or water-supply as the causes and extent of the epidemic. The effect of season has already been men- tioned. The Plague Medical Officer writes that the insanitary conditions of the villages and the lack of personal cleanliness of the people-the women especially-were very favourable to the spread of plague. Mortality among rats. Mr. Levi writes :- (m).    The subject  of rat  mortality has  already been  referred  to.    On this subject " Mortality among rats was universal in all villages. The mortality was generally observed after the occurrence of the first case : rats then died more rapidly than human beings and as a rule in one or two weeks all the rats in the village were dead. In villages which were very promptly evacuated the disinfectors subsequently found the houses full of dead rats.    As a rule the rats all died in the villages, whether the outbreak was mild or severe." Mention has also been made of dogs dying of plague, after eating human plague- infected corpses. Dr. Mahoney also states that cats and dogs were exterminated in some villages owing to their having eaten rats dead of plague. Type of disease. (n).    The   disease  was   chiefly of the bubonic type of plague. It was not observed that any class had any special liability to or immunity from attack of plague. Of the 54 men employed on disinfection work only 1 was attacked who recovered.    All the disinfectors had been inoculated, some twice and others three times.
?69 Treatment. (o).    No   methods   of   treatment were found to give favourable results. It has already been mentioned that the people preferred treatment by their own hakms. Dr. Mahoney states that the hakims usually treat to suppress the buboes by the application of leeches or hot sand fomentation, and when this was unsuccessful they tried to produce suppuration by applying the juice of the madar or ak plant. Recommendations. (p).    Mr.   Millar considers  that   prompt   evacuation   is  really  the  best remedy for plague, and with reference to it he writes :- " Persuation was useless as there were factions in the village.    An order  would have been acted upon by all.    This was at first             *              *              * " I am opposed to the policy of non-interference read literally. In a case where all factions and jealousies could be stifled by the Deputy Commissioner's verbal order it is rather a pity such an order could not be given. Of course I do not advocate any use of force, nor  would one give  an order unless it was generally desired.    *        *        *         " If a few men are punished-Section 269, Indian Penal Code-when they have acted in opposition to the wishes of the village, this would very much strengthen the hands of the village community. If the Lambardrs of a village of themselves come and lay a com- plaint under Section 269, Indian Penal Code, 1 think it might be enquired into." Mr. Millar further considers that " a Zaildr, Sufedposh or even Lambardr who prevented evacuation should have some sort of punishment,'' and he proposes to keep a book in which to enter names of such men remarking that everybody of any importance has some ambition, something he wants-chairs, sufedposhi, zaildri, Government employ- ment for relatives, and so on. If they knew there was a black book in which names were actually recorded, there would be much less opposition in order to satisfy private grudges and enmities or to diminish the   influence   of a rival. While thinking that punishment should be inflicted upon influential men who oppose such measures as evacuation, Mr. Millar advocates the granting of rewards to prominent helpers. He considers that a liberal granting of rewards, particularly to Lambardrs, is advisable. Next to prompt evacuation Mr. Millar considers that inoculation is the only remedy. He dwells however  upon the necessity for care in carrying it out, remarking that - " The people are of a most suspicious temperament. They will not be driven, and any attempt  to drive them  will end   most seriously, probably in actual violence." Finally, Mr. Millar insists upon the necessity of employing only European officers, Executive and Medical, for plague   duty in the Ferozepore District. Staff and establishment. (q).   The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district :- (I)  Dr. H. C. Mahoney and 3 Hospital Assistants. Plague in Ferozepore City. (r).    As has been mentioned two cases of plague with  deaths occurred in Ferozepore City during the year under report. The first case occurred on April 3rd and was imported from Ludhina. Precautionary measures. On the occurrence of plague the  city was divided into   five sanitary wards,  members being appointed for each ward ; two hakims - one a Hindu, the other a Muhammadan-were, also appointed by the Municipal Committee. A list of persons  coming  from   infected  villages was kept by each Octroi Muharrir, and the people were watched by the Sanitary staff. Information. For reporting cases and deaths a Muharrir was appointed to whom plague occurrences were reported by coolies appointed for this purpose. The Sanitary staff was also required to report all deaths daily. Evacuation and segregation. The   people  of  infected quarters were  unwilling to evacuate their houses, but a few imported   cases were removed by their friends to plague huts  for treatment. Disinfection. Nine houses-6 infected and   3   bordering on infected houses-were   disinfected, a mate and 8 disinfecting coolies being  employ- ed on the work. Inoculation. Notices  in  English   and  Vernacular were issued by the Deputy Commissioner and Civil   Surgeon  advising   the   people    to   be inoculated.    240 persons were inoculated. No mortality among rats was noticed. Rat mortality.
?70 Lahore Division. MONTGOMERY DISTRICT. 45.    Only 2 cases of plague, neither of which were fatal, occurred in the Mont- gomery District during 1901-02. Both of these cases were imported from Rewind into the village of Jandoka in Gugera Tahsil in April. The patients were segregated, their clothes and bedding burnt compensation being given, and the infected' houses thoroughly disinfected. Captain Buck, the Deputy Commissioner, writes that the people acquiesced in all the arrangements made. There being only imported plague cases in the district no  special Medical staff was detailed in this district. LAHORE DISTRICT. 46. Plague made its appearance in the Lahore District for the first time during the year under report.  All four tahsls were infected as well as the city of Lahore. Excluding the city of Lahore 20,006 cases of plague with 9,280 deaths occurred; in the city of Lahore there were 208 cases with 120 deaths: The outbreaks in the city of Lahore and in the rest of the district will be noticed separately; that in the city of Lahore being dealt with last, as it did not commence until some time after the district had become infected. Plagus in the Lahore   District  excluding the city  of Lahore Review of the epidemic. The following account of the epidemic in the Lahore District consists chiefly of extracts from the report of Mr. Atkins, the Deputy Commissioner, supplemented, where necessary, by information supplied by Assist- ant Surgeon Vidya Ntha Singh, the Plague Medical Officer:- " The disease was first discovered in this district in Lulini, a village of 6,300 inhabit- ants in Kasr Tahsil, on the Lahore Ferozepore road, some 10 miles north of Kasr. It ap- pears that in April or May some labourers from Silkot District came and stayed for some time in huts near the road close to the Police Station. There appear to have been some deaths among them and after they left, some deaths occurred among females living in the neighbourhood where these people had stayed. It was not till October that the death- rate began to be noticeably high and the suspected presence of plague was first reported by Mr. M. Crosse, Inspector of Schools. The place was visited at once by the Sub-Divi- sional Officer, the Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner in succession, but the people could not be induced to adopt evacuation or disinfection. Four hundred and eighty six cases of plague and 236 deaths were reported to have occurred here. The disease was communicated by visits of condolence to the neighbouring village of Khanoharni and similarly to other villages in the neighbourhood. The principal centre of the disease in this district has been in the Lahore and Kasr Tahsls along the Ferozepare road within 8 or 10 miles of Kana Kcha and Lulini. Another infected area extended from Lahore down the river as far as Chung and a third' area was on the Shekhupura road round the large village of Shekhupura. The Chunin and Sharakpur Tahs Is did not suffer much. The disease broke out in Kasr in December 1901 in one muhalla which was turned out and the houses disinfected. For a time it appeared that the town was saved, but some 15 days later it appeared in a neighbouring house which had taken in some of the undisinfected belongings of the people who had been turned out. In the town of Chunin the disease appeared, but took no hold. The only other town of considerable size is Patti where a few cases occurred." In Statement No. 1 (Appendix A) are shown the number of infected villages and the number of cases and deaths from plague in the different tahsls of the Lahore District during the year under report. Statement No. 2 (Appendix A) shows that the disease increased till it reached its zenith in April. After the middle of May it died away with great rapidity and in June very few cases were reported. The epidemic ceased in August, no cases having been reported in September. It was noticed that in each village the course of the disease was usually the same. There were a few cases at first, then an interval followed by a more violent attack. The disease then diminished in that village Lulini, the first village to be attacked, had its most violent attack in January and February. Then the disease died away and the village was nearly free in April when the district was getting worse. Similarly, Kasr almost got rid of. the disease in May, having its worst time in April. A noticeable feature of the epidemic of plague in the Lahore District is the comparatively low proportion of deaths to attacks This is only 46.50 as compared with 65.04 in the whole of the Province and 73.44. in the Ludhina District.
?71 There is little reason to suspect that plague cases were reported more or deaths less freely in the Lahore than in other districts, and this lowered case mortality can thus only be explained by the assumption that the disease was less severe in the Lahore District than in most other parts of the Province. This is borne out by experience in certain villages and in the town of Kasr where most of the cases of plague were seen by Medical Officers and in which the fatality of attacks was lower than usual the percentage fatality of attacks was 48.99, 50.67, in Bhija 40.47, in Raypur 42.62 and in but few villages in which cases of plague were verified by Medical Officers was the percentage of deaths to attacks over 50. The severity of the disease varied greatly however in different villages, in some of which the outbreaks were very severe, as regards both the proportion of the population attacked and the case mortality. In the subjoined table are given particulars of certain villages in which the outbreaks were especially severe.

The people their bearing in the presence of plague, and their attitude towards plague measures. (a) The population of the infected villages consisted for the most part of agriculturist Sikhs and Muhammadans who have-the Sikhs especially-a reputation for independence of character. Owing to canal irrigation, the lands of most villages are well cultivated and the people are fairly well off. Bearing. Of their bearing in the presence of the epidemic the Deputy Commissioner writes:- " People have now pretty well come to regard plague, as they do other diseases, as the act of God. But for a long time it was ascribed to the Sirkr working through the ' dktar log.' The most general idea was that Government had found, from the Census and from the occurrence of recent famines, that the population was too large and consequently had given a sort of contract to the doctors to kill off so many lakhs. " There was a very widespread impression that doctors or doctors in disguise were going about putting poison in wells. In very many villages guards were placed over drinking wells which were watched day and night. A survey party working in Chunin was assaulted in one village and had difficulty in other villages as they were thought to be doing something to the wells. To a considerable extent these impressions have now disappeared.
?72 " When plague first appeared people regarded it as an ordinary disease and did not attempt to avoid contact with the stricken nor shrink from disposing of the dead in the ordinary way. But as the disease spread in a village there was in many cases a panic. Many people ran away from badly stricken villages and the dead were left to lie without burial till they grew too offensive to be endured." Assistant Surgeon Vidya Ntha Singh writes  :- " The majority of the people believed that doctors were the chief men who spread the plague and this some believed they did for their own living and maintenance, for if plague died out many of them would be discharged from Government service. The people therefore hated the sight of medical men in their villages, and believed that on their first entry into a village they sow broadcast somehow the seed of the disease." Attitude. It may be inferred from the passage just quoted that the attitude of the people towards plague measures was one of considerable hostility. This indeed was the case for some time until, in fact, the ravages of the disease had severely alarmed them. Even then, the measures advocated by Government officials were but sparingly adopted and in any case more by Sikhs than by any others. Effects of the epidemic on agriculture, &c (b) Of the effect of the epidemic on trade, agriculture, &c., the Deputy Commissioner- writes as follows:- " There has not yet been any change in the material prosperity, though in some villages some of the land must have remained uncultivated. I do not think there has been any noticeable effect on litigation or crime. No difficulties about orphan children have come to notice." Measnres to prevent outbreak of plague in uninfect- ed places. (c)   Of the measures taken by the people themselves to  prevent outbreaks of  plague among them; Mr. Atkins writes:- " Uninfected villages in infected neighbourhoods became after a while a little careful about admitting people from infected villages, and in some cases where the proprietors were strong and could co-operate they appointed chaukidrs to keep people out. Such precautions were however usually very ineffectual in most villages as the particular friend of the visitor would wish to admit him and the others were not united enough to prevent him." In no place were any arrangements made for the  exercise of surveillance over arrivals from infected places. Arrangements for obtaining information. (d) Of the arrangements for obtaining information concerning plague occurrences the Plague Medical Officer writes:- Arrangement for obtaining information   of attacks and deaths. " The following arrangement was adopted for obtaining information concerning plague attacks and deaths. The Lambardrs of each infected village were held responsible for making a daily report of their circles of fresh attacks and deaths to the chaukidr who communicated the matter to the Patwri who entered in a register and submitted a copy to the Plague Officer either by a special messenger or by post- cards printed and distributed to them beforehand. The checking of these returns was possible in the beginning, but afterwards when the number of infected villages rose high and the work increased it became impracticable and was abandoned." The Deputy Commissioner remarks:- " On the whole, there is reason to think that in the district cases have not been much concealed after the people learnt to recognise it and after they were satisfied that no com- pulsory measures would be taken." In the town of Kasr a hakim and a muharrir were appointed for the reporting of plague occurrences. The muharrir maintained a register of cases and deaths reported to him by the hakim and this register was presented daily to the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the dispensary who visited all patients. Somewhat similar arrangements were made in other Municipal towns. Evacuation. (e) Of evacuation the Plague Medical Officer writes that it was not adopted to any great extent or with any degree of thoroughness. The Deputy Commissioner remarks:- " In a few cases villagers were persuaded to resort to evacuation, but, as a rule, they took the infection with them and finding that they had not immediately escaped, they returned to their villages. In many cases zamindrs who had wells to go to went out to live on
?73 them, but' otherwise there was little in the way of-evacuation. After the weather grew warm in April many people lived in the fields, but there was usually the difficulty of leaving their houses unguarded. In no case did Khatris leave their houses, and I do not think that any villages were completely evacuated except two or three hamlets belonging to Nwab Fateh Ali Khn."                                                                                        *   S .   Cordons and guards. (f) No cordons or guards were employed over the sites of evacuated villages. In the town of Kasr the inhabitants of the first muhallas to be infected went into camps, and such of their property as they did not take with them was taken charge of by the Civil authorities and stored by them in a house over which a guard was appointed. Lists were prepared of the property deposited by each family, and on the re-occupation of the houses the property was restored to the owner after it had been disinfected. The effects of evacuation, even where only partial, are noted by the Plague Medical Officer to have been beneficial in the case of several villages, and he notices some instances of striking benefit resulting from evacuation combined with the disinfection of infected houses. Segregation. (g) The segregation of sick and contacts was but very rarely observed, though the Deputy Commissioner mentions that in a few cases where early information was received the first cases of plague were segregated by the efforts of Plague Officers and even by villagers of their own accord, with beneficial results. Medical treatment (h) The Plague Medical Officer states that medical treatment was offered, but was not accepted by the people. Disinfection. (i) Of  chemical  disinfection the Deputy Commissioner writes:- " Chemical disinfection was largely resorted to in Kasr Town where the people showed themselves on the whole in sympathy with our measures. In the few cases that occurred in the smaller Municipal towns, chemical disinfection was done more or less by order, though no formal order had to be passed. Government buildings were also chemically disinfected. The only villages in which there was chemical disinfection were a few in Kasr Tahsil. In these cases, it was not accompanied by evacuation, but it seems to have stopped the disease till fresh infection was imported. " Chemical disinfection was in all cases done by a special gang under an Assistant Surgeon. Disinfection is not popular, but is asked for by a few intelligent people usually in towns or large villages, when their houses are infected by the disease, or by dead rats." Assistant Surgeon Kidr Nth Bhandri, who was in charge of the disinfection operations in the town of Kasr, states that every infected house in Kasr was chemically disinfected, though all were not completely evacuated. Altogether 711 houses, consisting of 2,865 rooms, were disinfected with perchloride of mercury solution. Of these houses 26 were disinfected at the request of the occupiers on account of the death of rats in them. Cases of plague occurred after disinfection in 27 of the 685 infected houses : all these cases occurred either within 2 or 3 days after disinfection or after a considerable interval ; and this was not attributable to imperfect disinfection. In the town of Kasr personal effects were also chemically disinfected at the com- mencement of the epidemic: no mention is made of the disinfection of personal effects in villages. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that the attempts at disinfection by fire by the people themselves were very feeble and ineffective. Inoculation. (j) The number of inoculations performed in the Lahore District outside the City and Municipality of Lahore was 11,274. Of the attitude of the people towards it, the Deputy Commissioner writes:- " People were at first greatly frightened of and opposed to inoculation. All sorts of rumours were started about it. " The operation was supposed by different people to cause death, impotency, leprosy or plague. It is still far from popular. What has been done has been done largely by official pressure." And the Plague Medical Officer remarks:- " The most common objection put forward by Muhammadans was that to try to run away from death is sin. They think that plague is certain death ordained by God and to inoculate  with a view to avert it is sin."
?74 Of the measures taken to induce its acceptance Assistant Surgeon Vidya Ntha Singh writes:- " In order to enlighten the understanding of ignorant mass with regard to the pre- ventive effects of inoculation, a few meetings were convened in Kasr Town and lectures were given by Assistant Surgeon Kidr Nth Bhandri and other educated Municipal members and residents of the town. In villages also attempt was always made to collect them in one place and preach on the good effects of inoculation." As to the effects of inoculation but few statistics could be collected. Of the 16,023 persons inoculated in rural areas 100 were known to have been attacked with plague, of whom 14 died. In the town of Kasr only 6 persons of the 934 inoculated were attacked with plague, of whom 1 died. Most of the persons inoculated in Kasr were occupants or neighbours of infected houses. No ill effects were known to have followed inoculation, though during the hot weather the people complained that much fever followed the operation. Infection. (k) Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer record that the infection of plague was almost invariably con- veyed by human intercourse either in the bodies of persons suffering from the disease or in clothing or other personal effects. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that there was no reason to think that plague is conveyed in grain or food or articles of merchandise, and speaking of rat mortality he states that it was usually noticed after plague had broken out in a village, so that rats have not apparently been the usual means of conveying infection. In this connection however the following extract from a report written by Assistant Surgeon Kidr Nth Bhandri of Kasr is of considerable interest, as it indicates that the in- fection of plague was conveyed by some other means than direct human intercourse. It will be noticed that he considers that infection was not brought to his house by rats as it was at some distance from the town, but that it was conveyed in some ' bhoosa' from an infected village. It should be stated, however, that the Assistant Surgeon's house is only separated from the town by a few hundred yards. The Assistant Surgeon writes as follows:- " I myself and my family had a narrow escape from plague. I discovered two dead rats in my house on 22nd February 1902, which made me vacate the house and take up my residence in tents. Next day I found 24 dead rats in the house and others on subsequent days. The house was disinfected by mercury lotion, was white-washed and was kept vacant for about two months. My house is at a distance from the town and the infection was not brought by the rats. The infection was brought to my house through ' bhoosa' which I received from a village which was not declared infected at the time, but on subsequent enquiry I found out that there had been a few cases of plague in that village. I discovered- dead rats in my house five days after the arrival of the ' bhoosa'." That when the infection of plague has been ever introduced into a town or a village it is disseminated by rats appears to be well established by the experience of the Lahore District. The Deputy Commissioner remarks :- "Mortality among rats usually occurred, or was reported, after the plague had appeared, but before the disease became general in a village." The Plague Medical Officer writes:- "That rats migrate from an infected village to a non-infected one has not been observed by any one, but that when one house becomes infected the rats from this one, infected all the adjoining and neighbouring houses, is a matter which there is reason to believe is of daily occurrence." And Assistant Surgeon Kidr Nth Bhandri records that in Kasr- " The infection was also conveyed by the rats from one house to the other and several rats used to be found dead in the streets and the infected houses every day. It has been found that the rats began to die first and the human beings were attacked afterwards." Of the manner in which plague is contracted by human beings or other animals, little mention is made. Assistant Surgeon Vidya Ntha Singh, however, notices that it is apparently not ingested as officials on plague duty had to get most of their food including milk and water from infected villages for some months, but that none contracted plague. Influence of local conditions. (l) The Plague Medical Officer remarks that the spread of plague in the Lahore District was retarded by the extreme cold of December and January and the extreme heat of June.
?75 He notices that the outbreaks were less severe in villages on dry sandy soil than in those the soil of which was moist and clayey. He also states that those classes suffered most from the disease who lived amidst the most insanitary surroundings such as Chamrs and sweepers. Mortality amongst rats. (m)  Reference has already been made to mortality among rats. This was observed in almost every infected village and it usually occurred between 10 and 20 days before the disease assumed epidemic proportions. The  Deputy  Commissioner remarks that the proportion of attacks was usually higher in villages in which rat  mortality occurred than in those in which it did not, though no relation was observed between rat mortality and the fatality of attacks among human beings. No definite evidence was obtained of plague among other animals. The Plague Medical Officer writes:- " No  measures were taken  by people to kill rats. With Hinds rat killing is as great a sin as killing a man." Type of plague. (n)   The bubonic type of plague prevailed, though cases  of pnuemonic and  septic plague were also observed. The Plague Medical Officer writes:- "The rush of the work did not allow of the means and opportunity of collecting statistics from which to calculate the ratio of one to the other." Classes affected. As already mentioned, it was remarked that plague affected Chamrs  and sweepers. Other menial  classes also suffered badly, and women of  all classes suffered more than men. Commenting on these facts Mr. Atkins says:- " The probable explanation is, that the menials are poor and live in smaller, more crowded and dirtier houses. They often sleep on the ground, they could not go out, and live on their wells as zamindrs often did. Women are more in the house than men, go about more with bare feet, often wear clothes touching the ground, and lead less healthier lives." No special features of the disease were noticed, and as already mentioned no opportunities for observing the results of medical treatment were afforded. Recommendations. (o)   The Plague  Medical Officer makes no suggestions, but Mr. Atkins writes with reference to the management of plague operations:- " The proper way, in my opinion, is to  put the local officers on special duty and - relieve them by officers sent for the ordinary Tahsil or District work. " If one talks to them first about the ordinary affairs of the village and gets them talking one can then lead up to plague and they are not nearly so shy and reserved about it. The Tahsildr of the tahsil and the Extra Assistant Commissioner who is doing bad livelihood cases can do much more with the people than a man who goes on special plague duty." The  Commissioner, Mr. Younghusband, endorses these remarks. Staff and establishment. (p) The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:- (1) Assistant Surgeon Vidya Ntha Singh. (2) Assistant Surgeon Hari Ll Basu. (3) Assistant Surgeon Umro Beg and 1 Hospital Assistant and 1 Compounder. LAHORE CITY AND MUNICIPALITY. 47. The first outbreak of plague in the City and Municipality of Lahore occurred during the year under report. It was fortunately a mild one, only 208 plague cases with 120 deaths having been reported, and of these 38 cases, 22 of which were fatal, were imported from other infected places. The following account of the outbreak is compiled from that given in the report of the Deputy Commissioner, who states that he was able to adopt the report of Mr. Calvert, City Magistrate of Lahore, almost unaltered:- "The first cases of plague reported within Municipal limits were in Muhalla Sathan in the city near the tahsil, on 10th January 1902. Plague had appeared in the district in the preceding November and meanwhile all the necessary preparations had been made. The matters of Sanitary Sub-Committees, hospitals, disinfectors, and special conservancy staff had been attended to and the Municipality was well prepared for the outbreak.
?76 City-Muhalla Sathn. "The infected houses were disinfected within 24 hours of the outbreak becoming known, and the work of disinfection was extended to  neighbouring  houses with  considerable success, for, though  13  of the  16  indigenous cases that occurred in the first  three months were from this muhalla, the cases always occurred just outside the disinfected area. Kcha Hingnn. Plague was carried from this muhalla to Kucha Hingnn, Sa Bazr,, in the very heart of the city, but vigorous disinfection stamped this out and no cases have since been reported from this locality. " From 18th January to 12th March not a single indigenous case of plague was reported in the city and it was not until the beginning of April that any considerable number of cases were reported either in the city or elsewhere within Municipal limits. "Leaving Muhalla Sathn, the most severe outbreak occurred in Landa Bazr where 30 cases occurred between 18th April and the end of May: these cases were either among the shop-keepers or the sweepers in the neighbouring muhalla. There were altogether ten keepers of eating-houses who became ill, and most of these cases occurred in Landa Bzr. Some of these shop-keepers lived in Chohatta Wasti Bhagat just near Wazr Khn's Chauk, and an outbreak here at the beginning of June was only checked by the hot weather. Anrkali. " In Anrkali there were a few imported cases in February and March, but it was not until 10th April that, in Dhobi Mandi, there was any serious indigenous plague; in the course of the next two months practically the whole of Anarkali became infected, but Dhobi Mandi (18 cases) and Butcher Khna (15 cases) and their immediate neighbours suffered most. Villages and Civil Station. " The villages within Municipal limits and  the Civil Station were hardly affected. Plague firs tappeared in Mozang on 29th January, being directly imported from Kahna: it was at once stamped out by vigorous disinfection: there was an attempt to hide the first death. This village then escaped till April when a few more cases occurred. There were a few cases in Garhi Shhu and Rjgarh in June: the zamndrs of both villages are Arins who are related to those of infected villages outside Municipal limits." Attitude of the people. Effect of the epidemic upon trade, &c. (a) The attitude of the people towards measures is described by the Deputy Commis- sioner as one of suspicion and passive opposi- tion. In one instance a man was prosecuted for refusing to have his house disinfected and evacuated. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that the man had been undoubtedly insti- gated in his opposition by others and an attempt was made to raise a subscription to defray the expenses of the revision of his case in the Chief Court. The movement was, however, very quickly snubbed out of existence by the general public feeling. As the outbreak was not severe it did not produce much alarm and did not interfere with trade or other matters. Measures taken to prevent  outbreaks   of  plague   in uninfected places. (b) The precautionary measures which were adopted on the approach of plague have already been referred to in the review of the epidemic. It should be added that on the. ap- pearance of the disease in the city a Health Officer was appointed whose duties were mainly connected with plague operations. Captain E. S. Peck, I. M. S., was the first officer so appointed. He arrived on February 4th and left on July 11th, 1902, when he was succeeded by Major H. C. Hodgkins, I. S. M. D. (retired). There was no organised system of surveillance over arrivals from infected areas, but imported cases of plague were reported by muhalladrs. For a short time after the discovery of plague in Lulini an observation post was maintained near the octroi post on the Feroze- pore road, but it was discontinued as not being in accordance with orders of the Govern- ment. It is recorded that the only precautions the people took of their own initiation were that in a few instances residents of street or muhalla tried to turn out or refuse admission to imported cases or brought pressure to bear upon indigenous cases to go to hospital or leave Lahore. A few people used phenyle and others lit fires in their houses. Methods for obtaining information concerning plague occurrences. (c) Among the duties of members of the Sanitary Ward Committees was that of re- porting all plague occurrences in t heir respective wards. These obtained information from mu- halladrs and others and sent daily reports' to the Health Officer, who personally verified all cases except where objections were raised, by the patients or their friends.
?77 The mortality returns were checked by men posted at the burial grounds and burning ghts, who made enquiries as to the disease from which deceased persons had suffered. The reporting of cases appears to have been fairly satisfactory, although it is recorded that some of the members of Municipal and Sanitary Ward Committees connived at the con- cealment of cases. That there was not much concealment appears most likely that the mortality from all causes during the epidemic was not very greatly in excess of the average mortality for the previous five years, and that in spite of concurrent outbreaks of small-pox and measles and inspite also of a considerable influx of refugees from other infected places. Evacuation. (d) Except in the case of a few Arns in Bzr Hakmn  and Muhalla  Sathn who voluntarily left their infected houses and went to live near their wells on the river bank, no evacuation was practised at Lahore. Segregation of sick and contacts. (e) In only a very few instances was segregation of sick and contacts observed. As has been seen hospitals were provided and in a few instances the indigenous cases were induced to go to hospital by the pressure brought upon them  by their neighbours, but this was all that was done. Medical treatment. (f) European medical treatment was asked for very rarely, the people preferring to be treated by hakms and baids. Disinfection : Chemical disinfection. (g)  Chemical disinfection was carried out at first vigorously and was applied only to houses in which cases of plague had occurred in those adjoining them, but afterwards, owing to the opposition of the people towards it, it was confined to houses whose owners consented to its being done and to badly infected localities such as the Dhobi Mandi and Landa Bzr.  In these places it was carried out in a wholesale way. The coloured solution was unpopular, and several people offered to do their own disinfection rather than have their houses messed about by the official gang. Altogether 1,688 rooms were disinfected. The effects of disinfection were satisfactory: in no instance did plague re-appear in a house that had been disinfected, and in referring to the muhalla first infected Mr. Calvert notes: " Though 13 of the 16 indigenous cases that occurred in the first three months were from the muhalla, the case always occurred just outside the disinfected area " Popular methods. Reference has already been made to the use of phenyle, and to the lighting  of fires in their house, by a few people. Inoculation. (h) Only 4,749 inoculations were performed in Lahore during the year under report, and the  figures include a  large number of villagers who came in considerable numbers to be operated upon  Inoculation was begun on January 13th at the tahsil, but in spite of as much publicity as possible there were very few volunteers. There were the wildest rumours as to the effects of the operation, persons were reported to have died of it, and it was said to have produced impotency, blindness and other ills. During April and May, owing to the people having learnt by experience that the rumours were unfounded, a considerable number came forward for inoculation, but much harm was done by the publication in a native paper about the middle of May of state- ments that two persons had died from the effects of inoculation. Enquiries proved that the statements were false, but it was some time before the confidence could be restored. Result of  inoculation. No cases of plague were reported  among inoculated persons, nor was there any other instance of any injury following the op- eration. The statistics of inoculation in Lahore  City and Municipality will be found in the subjoined table.

(i) It has already been mentioned that infection was first introduced into Lahore City by a woman from  Silkot. Other centres of infection were caused by refugees from the muhallas first attacked and from other infected places. Human intercourse was largely responsible for the spread of infection through the city, but it is recorded by Mr. Calvert that in several quarters no human beings were attacked until 8 or 10 days after mortality among rats was ob- served, the first victim sometimes being a person who had handled the dead bodies of the rats. In the case of the first infected muhalla however-Muhalla Sathn-rat mortality was not noticed until a month after the occurrence of the first case of plague. Effects' of local conditions. (j)   But little reference is made in the Deputy Commissioner's report as to the effect of local conditions upon the course and extent of the epidemic.  The most remarkable feature of the outhreak is that in spite of infection having been introduced into several parts of a thickly crowded city like Lahore, the sanitary condition of which leaves much to be desired, in spite also of the attitude of the people to all measures for dealing with the dis- ease which rendered their effective performance in many instances impossible, the mortality from plague was not much greater than it was. Plague among rats or other animals. (k) Reference has already been made to mortality among rats: no other animals were noticed to have suffered from plague and no measures were taken for the destruction of rats. The Municipality offered a reward of 1 pice for every two rats destroyed, but in no case was the reward claimed. People usually threw the dead bodies of rats found in their houses into the streets, whence they were removed by the Municipal sweepers and burnt. Type and severity of the  disease. (l)   The cases of plague which occurred in Lahore City and Municipality were nearly all of the bubonic variety, only one case of septic plague having been recorded and was for the most part of a mild type, the fatality of indigenous cases having been only 47.11 per cent, The disease was entirely confined to the native community and chiefly to the poorer classes; with this exception no special liability to or immunity from attacks of plague on the part of any particular classes were noticed.
?79 Recommendations. (m) The Deputy Commissioner recommends that complete arrangements for inocu- lation should be made in the cold weather, and thinks that if the operation ever became fashion- able the demand for it would be great, and if not met would result in a loud outcry. He supports Mr. Calvert and Captain Peck in recommending that chemical dis- infection should be restricted in the city to houses the owners of which ask for it. The Commissioner, however, dissents from this opinion; he points out the favourable results that have attended the disinfection of infected houses during the epidemic and compares the state of six months' plague in Lahore with three months' plague in Gujrnwla, where little or no disinfection was carried out. In the Civil Station the Deputy Commissioner considers disinfection should be insisted on. The Deputy Commissioner considers the employment of European Officers on plague operations in the city inadvisable, but with this also the Commissioner disagrees, and re- marks "that except for European supervision, advice, remonstrance and encouragement, there would probably have been no exception at all " to the general uselessness of the Sanitary Ward Committees. Mr. Atkins concludes: " Regrettable as it is we must wait till the people learn by suffering before we can help them as we would." AMRITSAR DISTRICT. Review of the epidemic. 48. Although imported cases of plague had occurred in the Amritsar District on a few occasions since the first appearance of the disease in the Punjab there was no epidemic of plague in this district until the year under report. This year however in addition to an outbreak in the city 59 villages were reported as infected with plague. The following table shows the number of infected places and the number of plague cases and deaths in each tahsl :- Tahsl. Population. Cases. Deaths. Remarks. Amritsar City 161,039 189 118  Do. Tahsl 164,462 1 706 1,054  Tarn Tran do. 325 576 1,154 630  Ajnla do. 209 869 96 35   Total 860,946 3,145 1,837  Of the epidemic Mr. Maclagan, the Deputy Commissioner, writes:- "Excluding a case or two in the city the first appearance of the plague was in the middle of March when it broke out almost simultaneously in the city itself, at Bath (on the road between Jullundur and Tarn Tran), and at Pakhanpura (on the road between Gurdspur and Amritsar). It extended to some villages near Bath, and then broke out in a group of villages in the immediate south-west of Amritsar City and in the city itself. By the beginning of May it had taken a hold on a fairly large tract south-west of the city and then crept up along the Ajnla road towards Ajnla. The disease was never however at all serious in the Ajnla Tahs 1, where it soon died out. In the end of June it disappeared from the Tarn Tran Tahsl and subsequently existed only in Amritsar City and in the neighbourhood of Pakhanpura on the Gurdspur road, where it had begun in March."

?81 Although the epidemic was not very extensive or severe, a few villages suffered seriously both as regards the incidence and fatality of plague. A list of such villages is given below. It will be seen that in one village Ibban Khurd 20 per cent. of the population was attacked with plague :- Table showing the highest percentage of attacks to population and of fatality to attacks in the Amritsar District.

The people their bearing in the presence of plague, and their attitude towards plague measures. (a) Of the classes and character of the population, Colonel Mulroney, the Civil Sur- geon of Amritsar, writes that in most villages they were mixed communities of agriculturists -Hinds, Muhammadans and sweepers. Bearing. In city and in some villages, where the outbreaks of plague were severe, consider- able alarm was shown by the people, many of whom fled: flight was especially noticeable on the part of the Mrwri residents of the city. The Deputy Commissioner writes that the dead were disposed of in the ordinary way, but the number of mourners was generally much smaller than usual, and in the city the city persons ready to remove corpses were Bikneri coolies. Attitude towards plague measures. Everywhere, though less in the city than elsewhere, rooted dislike was shown by the people to official interference. Effect of epidemic on agriculture, &c. (b) Of the effects of the epidemic on agriculture, &c., Mr. Maclagan writes : - "Agriculture was not affected in any way by the plague. A few schools were closed for a time and a few cases in the law courts were postponed in consequence of the outbreak, but no serious inconvenience was felt in these directions. The city trade was, however, to some extent affected especially that in cloth which is conducted by Mrwr traders and the owners of shops in the Mrwr quarters lost a good deal of rent. The octroi for May fell off a good deal, but nearly recovered in June." Measures to prevent outbreak in uninfected places. (c) The exclusion of outsiders was tried in several villages, but as it was carried out by the people themselves, the success was only partial. Surveillance over outsiders was not exercised in the city or elsewhere. Information. (d) Information regarding plague occurrences was obtained from Patwrs who submitted returns for the Civil Surgeon. These returns were checked as regards deaths by comparison with the Patwrs' returns. The Deputy Commissioner remarks that in every part of the district, including the city, there was a tendency to conceal cases, and that outbreaks were in many instances only detected by a comparison of the mortality returns with the normal. Evacuation. (e) Very little was done in the way of evacuation.
?82 The Deputy Commissioner writes :- "Evacuation was not much resorted to, the educated classes, retired military men, &c., sometimes left their homes, and cases were noted in which men left the village site and lived on wells. In some villages the people adopted a suggestion of the Civil Surgeon's and lived on their roofs." Segregation. (f) No mention is made of the effect of such evacuation as was adopted. The Civil Surgeon states that the segregation of sick and contacts was not observed at all except in the city and only in the cases of attacked persons who were treated in the Municipal Plague Hospital ; he adds that medical treatment was not accepted in villages and only to a slight extent in the city. Disinfection. (g) Very little disinfection was done and was chiefly confined to the city. The only village in which more than one or two houses were disinfected was Bath ; this being the first infected village, an attempt was made to carry out disinfection thoroughly, but owing to the opposition of the people, operations had to be discontinued everywhere except in the city, where many infected houses were disinfected. There was strong objection to any sort of disinfection by official agency.  Altogether 214 houses were chemically disinfected, of which 136 were in the city of Amritsar and most of the remainder in the village of Bath. Phenyle 1 in 100 was the only disinfectant used both for houses and personal effects.  Of the results of disinfection Colonel Mulroney writes that out of 136 disinfected houses in the city only 3 became reinfected, while in the village of Bath 18 per cent. of the disinfected houses became reinfected. The Deputy Commissioner mentions that a few villagers bought phenyle and attempted disinfection themselves, but that these cases were very rare. Inoculation. (h) Inoculation was confined to the city of Amritsar where 1,508 persons were inoculated. Of these Colonel Mulroney notes 279 were  Policemen and 350 School boys and Teachers. Colonel Mulroney states that there is no objection to inoculation on religious grounds, but the people dislike it and in villages it is believed that inoculation causes the spread of plague instead of checking it.  The table given below shows the number of inoculations performed by each operator in the Amritsar District, monthly: -  Names of Inoculators. March. April. May.   June.   July.   August.  September.

Infection (i) Infection was in every case believed to have been conveyed by human intercourse. The Deputy Commissioner writes that there was no reason to suspect the conveyance of the disease by grain or food.
?83 Influence of local conpitihns. (j) Nothing particular was noticed concerning the influence of the local conditions in the villages; in the c ity the disease was chiefly limited to over-crowded and badly- ventilated qurters. Rat mortality. (k)  Mortality among rates was, the Deputy Commissioner notes, observed in every severe outbreak. It occurred from a week to a fortnight and was followed without an interval by the outbreak itself. There were no data to show whether severe mortality among men was concurrent with special mortality among rats. Colonel Mulroney states that although rat mortality was observed in many houses in the city, in only a few instances was it followed by the occurrences of plague cases. Type and severity of the disease. (l) Nearly 90 per cent. of these cases of  plague was of the bubonic variety, of the remainder  about  half  were pneumonic  and  half septicmic cases. Classes affected. (m) Plague attacked all classes, but the most affected were Mrwrs (in the city), Telis, Banis and others following in-door occupa- tions.  Women and children suffered more than men.  No person on plague duty was attacked. Treatment. (n)  Colonel Mulroney mentions that leeches were found for the relief of pain in buboes, applied six at a time and repeated if neces- sary on the third day. Recommendations. Mr. Maclagan writes:- " The only suggestions that I would venture to make on the basis of the experience of this small outbreak are- (1)    that anything approaching to compulsion either as regards disinfection or  as regards inoculation should be carefully avoided (2)    that the Medical staff employed should as far as possible be natives of this part of the Punjab, whom the people will understand and trust." The  latter recommendation is  strongly endorsed  by the Commissioner, Mr. Younghusband. Staff and establisement. (0)    The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:- (1)    Lieutenant-Colonel T. R. Mulroney, I.M.S., Civil Surgeon, in addition to his ordinary duties. (2)    Assistant Surgeon  Ri  Bahdur  Mehr Chand, in addition to his ordinary duties. (3)    Assistant Surgeon Keron Chandra Singha and two Hospital Assistants. GURDASPUR DISTRICT. Review of epidemic. 49.    The epidemic of plague in the Gurdspur District during the year under report originated as a recrudescence of the disease after the subsidence  of the epidemic of the previous year-the first to occur in the district. By October 1st, 1901, 17 villages in the Shakargarh Tahsl were already infected, and in December the disease appeared in the Batla and Gurdspur Tahsls ; it was not until February that the Pathnkot Tahsl became infected. The epidemic was a severe one. There were outbreaks in 765 villages and towns, and 25,868 cases of plague with 16,479 4eaths occurred.

?85  From Statement No. 1 (Appendix A) it will appear that the Shakargarh Tahsl suffered most, and it will be seen from the foregoing table that the epidemic increased gra- dually until December 1901, declined slightly during January 1902, again began to increase. in February, and culminated in March. There was a rapid decline from June to August. In September, although only two tahsls, Gurdspur and Pathnkot, were infected, the number of cases increased to 119, the recrudescence having begun. The severity of the outbreaks varied greatly in different villages. A table is given below in which are shewn the particulars of those villages in which the incidence or fatality of plague was more than usually high:- Table showing particulars of certain villages in the Gurdspur District in which the outbreaks of plague were especially severe.

(a) Of the bearing of the people in the presence of the epidemic and of the attitude towards plague measures and of the effect of the epidemic upon trade, &c., Major Dallas, the Deputy Commissioner, writes:- " Until there is a very severe outbreak of plague in a village, the people are generally very apathetic and as a rule do not seem to concern themselves at all, and even when it comes nearer home to them they are not at all inclined to adopt any measures which give them trouble, or interfere with their customs. There have been no complaints about the burial of the dead or case of orphans. With so many deaths in a district there must of course be some dislocation of business, but there are many large towns or centres of trade in this district, and so I cannot say that business has been very much interfered with, nor do I notice any very great diminution in crime or litigation." Preventive measures. (b) A large number of persons fled from the town of Gurdspur when plague was severe there. Very little was done to prevent outbreak of plague in uninfected places. In very few villages was any attempt made to exclude persons from infected places, though the Deputy Commissioner heard of " one village which placed some of their members on the road with a pile of grain to be distributed to beggars and fakrs who were to be requested to take something and pass by the village without entering it." Surveillance over arrivals in towns was in no case observed. Arrangement for obtaining information of plague occurrences. (c) Patwrs were responsible for recording and reporting all plague cases and deaths in their halks. These registers and returns were checked by Girdwars and other mem- bers of the Revenue staff.
?86 The Deputy Commissioner considers that when a village was declared to be infected all cases were reported, though there is no doubt that cases of plague were at first suppressed as "the people do not like to think that their village is plague-infected." Although the returns from some villages make it likely that all cases were not reported-in some instances the number of cases and deaths reported being the same, yet the statistics of the whole district, which show the case mortality to have been 63.70, do not indicate any concealment of cases. Evacuation. (d) Evacuation was very generally resorted to, though it was often only very partial. Even when families went into camp they kept up a constant communication with their houses, either to fetch necessaries or to look after their property. Moreover if cases occurred among females in camp they frequently returned to their houses saying that it was better to die in their own houses than outside. The Deputy Commissioner remarks:- " During the cold weather no doubt evacuation causes some hardship and at the slightest excuse of course they are ready to run back to their houses, and so undo any good they may have done by evacuation." A certain Maulvi preached against evacuation, saying that it was equivalent to emigration which was opposed to the tenants of the Moslem faith. His preaching influenced a certain number of villages, but the Maulvi afterwards changed his view. As to the effect of evacuation both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medi- cal Officer state that it is beneficial even when only partial, and Lla Labhu Rm, Execu- tive Plague Officer, has prepared a statement in which are compared the incidence of fatality of plague in a number of evacuated and non-evacuated villages. This statement is epitomised in the table given below:-  Number. Population. Cases. Deaths. Attacks per 100  of the population. Case mortality  per cent. Evacuated villages. 11 2,552  94  66 3.67  70.21 Non-evacuated villages 11 8,742 1,304  914  14.91  70.09 The figures given in this table show that while evacuation had no appreciable effect upon the case mortality of plague, the incidence of plague attacks was more than three times as greater among the inhabitants of non-evacuated than among those of evacuated villages. No mention is made as to the effect of evacuation upon the deviation of out- break of plague in villages. Cordons and guards. (e) No cordons or guards were employed to prevent access to evacuated villages or to protect property left in them. Segregation. Medical treatment. (f) The Plague Medical Officer reports that absolutely no segregation of sick and contacts was observed, but that European medical treatment was accepted freely. Disinfection. (g) Chemical disinfection was not generally adopted. It was not often asked for and was frequently only partial. More was done in the Shakargarh Tahsl where the people were more familiar with it than in other part of the district. The number of rooms disinfected was 6,186; of these 2,462 were in the Shakargarh, 3,432 in the Gurdspur and 292 in the Batala Tahsls. The coloured perchloride of mer- cury solution was used and disinfection was carried out by trained gangs. The effects of partial disinfection were not very satisfactory, but when carried out completely, disinfection was very beneficial and cases are recorded of outbreaks having been completely stopped by prompt and thorough disinfection. Popular methods. The people tried to disinfect their houses by replastering the walls and floors, by lighting fires on the floor of infected rooms and by making holes in the roofs and walls of the houses. Phenyle was very popular and the people asked for it to mix with the clay with which they plastered their houses.
?87 Inoculation. (h) A considerable number of inoculations was performed in the Gurdspur District during  the year  under report. Altogether 22,805 were done.  Of these  654 were per- formed in September by officers especially engaged for inoculation operations. Statistics of inoculation in the Gurdspur District will be found in Statement No. 6 Appendix B. The attitude of the people towards inoculation was at first one of distrust and dislike and for the most part they only resorted to it either during an outbreak of plague in the villages or when in imminent danger of one. Later they showed some confidence, and Major Dallas considers that the operations have been fairly generally popular. The Executive Plague Medical Officer remarks that in the Shakargarh Tahsl during the height of the epidemic the Medical-Officers could hardly cope with the demand for inoculation. The same rumours that have been mentioned as prevailing in other districts were also current in Gurdspur, namely, that inoculation produced blindness and impotency; that different kinds of fluids were used for different classes of persons, the people being given the worst, and so forth. Some persons-Rjpts and Brahmins-considered that their pardah system did not permit of their women being inoculated by men; others-chiefly, the Executive Plague Medical Officer remarks, Mullahs and Brahmans, who had a personal interest in the num- ber of persons dying-preached against inoculation as being against their religions. Among the objections raised against inoculation were that during the harvest the people could not spare the time to be inoculated; a similar objection was frequently urged by the very poor who said that they could not afford to remain idle for two or three days while suffering from the effects of inoculation. The method adopted for rendering the acceptance inoculation was the constant preaching of it by all the principal officials of the  district. The Plague Medical Officer; though he does not furnish detailed statistics, reports that effects of inoculation were most beneficial and mentions instances of villages the inha- bitants of which had been inoculated and reinoculated after three months escaping plague altogether, although completely surrounded by infected villages in one of these re-inoculat- ed villages which was situated only a few yards from a badly infected village and in which mortality among rats was observed. In no instance was any harm observed to follow inoculation. Two hundred and six inoculated persons contracted plague, of whom 63 died, a case mortality of only 30'58 per cent., less than half that of the general plague fatality in the district. Among the 1,143 persons inoculated in Gurdspur City, 1 man contracted plague and died. Infection. (i) As has already been said, the outbreak of plague in the Shakargarh Tahsl was in all  probability a recrudescence of the disease, and as stated in the report for 1900-01 it is probable that plague never died out in the tahsl. Infection was conveyed chiefly by human agency.  Major Dallas writes:- " There can, I think, be no doubt that the infection was brought to Bholeke and Saleh Chak from the Shakargarh Tahsl, and I think in the case of Bholeke it was brought by Ghumrs (carriers). As regards Parthenon, I am however, not so sure. It is true that Bambil and Basarwn, the first villages in that tahsl infected, are on the same side of the Ravi main stream as Shakargarh, but they are also close to the Jammu border, and I believe that plague was very bad there at the time also, and there is always a certain amount of traffic passing through Bambil  to and from Jammu. " Lla Labhu Rm gives instances in which the germs are supposed to have been carried in merchandise or goods, but I should be inclined to doubt this without further proof. If this were the case I do not understand how some of our large towns into which goods must come from plague-infected areas have escaped so long. Batla itself in this district did not become infected until June and yet goods from all parts of the district were taken there. " I cannot say that I have noticed any cases of rats or other animals carrying the germs from one village to another, though if they can do so from one house to another I see no reason why they should not do so from one village to another, if the villages are close enough."
?88 When due to human agency infection was most commonly conveyed by persons suffer- ing from or incubating plague, they being either residents of uninfected villages who had contracted the disease elsewhere-after attending the funerals of relatives who had died of plague or fugitives from infected places. Instances are mentioned in which infection was introduced by personal effects- first breaking out in the houses of persons who had received clothing or other articles from i nfected villages, and attacking persons who had not been exposed to direct infection. Of the manner in which infection is disseminated in infected places the Deputy Commissioner writes:- " Rats no doubt play an important part in carrying the disease from one house to another in the same village, and generally these animals have been found to be the first to be infected in a village. Deaths among them have generally been noticed about a fortnight or three weeks before such have occurred among human beings." The statement that rats have generally been found to be the first to be infected in a village does not necessarily mean that infection was introduced by them, and though it probably does mean that the animals are more susceptible to the disease than is mankind. The Plague Medical Officer suggests that plague is contracted through open sores, and the Deputy Commissioner attributes the greater liability of women to the disease to their being much in their houses in which they invariably go about barefooted. Influence of local conditions. (j) The Plague Medical Officer remarks that low-lying villages suffered most, though it may be noted here that the epidemic was most severe in the Shakargarh Tahsl which is by far the hottest and driest of the four tahsls of the district. The Deputy Commissioner notes that in this tahsl plague began to decrease before it did in the other tahsls which were colder and damper. Referring to the seasonal subsidence of plague, Major Dallas writes:- " The reason for the decrease in the hot weather is, I think, no doubt, due to the fact that people are less in their houses when it is hot than when it is cold. Even in the spring I noticed after a shower of rain, which cooled the atmosphere considerably, there was always a rise in the number of cases, as of course the people used their houses more." It should be remarked, however, that the lessened activity of plague during June, July and August cannot be altogether attributed to the more open-air life of the people, for, except during the stress of work during the harvest in April and May, the extent to which women live indoors is probably much the same all the year round; and during and immediately preceding the rains men are probably more indoors than at any other season. Moreover, the lessened activity of plague during the hot weather and rains in the Punjab is as well marked in towns as in villages, and as in towns the occupations of the people are mostly such as keep them indoors, the weather has comparitively little influence upon their habits in this respect. Mortality among rats or other animals. (k) Rat mortality was universal in infected villages, and in some villages it was observed that dogs, cats and squirrels died along with the rats. The Plague Medical Offi- cer believes that plague manifests itself among human beings about 8 days after the first dead rat is found in the premises. The Executive Plague Officer remarks that in some villages where rat mortality was very great the outbreaks of plague among human beings were very severe. Dr. Manook states that he has used a mixture consisting of equal proportions of Plaster of Paris and flour for the destruction of rats with satisfactory results. Type and severity of the disease. (l) The bubonic variety of the disease prevailed and cases of pneumonic or septic plague were only very occasionally met with. With regard to the variation in the severity of the disease at different seasons, Dr. Manook notes: "It was noticeable that in April and May when the hot winds were experienced the severity of the disease was less, viz., less mortality among the patients." This, however, is not borne out by statistics as will be seen from the following figures which give roughly the case mortality of plague in the Gurdspur District for each month of the epidemic:- Months.                 Octr. Novr. Decr. Jany. Febry. March April. May. June. July.. Augt. Septr. Case mortality ... 62 56 67 64 67 59  69 65 71 68 73 61 It will be noticed that the only months in which the case mortality exceeded that of April were June and August. The number of cases and deaths in June and August were
?89 however so small (314 cases with 224 deaths in June and 30 cases with 22 deaths in August that percentages based upon them are not as valuable as those based upon the larger figures (4,250 cases with 2,918 deaths) of April. It is possible too that the high death-rate in the months of June, July and August may be due to a number of cases not having been recognised as plague. Classes affected. (m)    The classes who suffered most from plague were chiefly menials or others whose duties required them to attend in one way or other upon infected persons-water-carriers, Brahmins, Mullahs, barbers and Achrajs, or who lived indoor lives, such as shop-keepers, carpenters and shoe-makers, or who were very poor, such as Chamars-while Gujars, Rjpts, Pathans and Syads were reported to have suffered less than other classes. Women of all classes suffered more than men. Treatment. n)  Dr. Manook  found that  the  early incision of buboes gave very favourable results. Recommendations. (o)    Major Dallas is not much in favour of partial disinfection of villages, though he considers that total disinfection would be most advantageous.  He considers that inoculation is the most important measure yet devised for dealing with plague. Dr. Manook recommends that a fund should be placed at the disposal of Medical Officers for distribution to the very poor when inoculated in order to prevent their suffering  loss from the enforced idleness for a day or two following the operation.  Dr. Manook also recommends that the prevention of persons who negligently  spread plague should be more freely resorted to. Dunera Inspection Post. (p) In order to  try and protect the  hill station  of  Dalhousie from infection, a Plague Inspection Post was established at Dunera on 24th April 1902.  At first this was a Disinfection  and  Inspection Post, but latterly it was only an  Inspection Post. No actual case of plague was detected, and no cases of plague were imported into Dalhousie Staff and establishment. (q) The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:- 1.    Dr. G. Manook. 2.    Assistant Surgeon Bashrat Ahmad. 3.    Assistant Surgeon Garish Chandra Chatterjee. 4.    Assistant Surgeon Chandra Shikr with 2 Hospital Assistants, 3 Compounders and 2 Dhs. Ri Bahdur Sobha Rm, Civil Surgeon, with 1 Hospital Assistant, 1 Compounder and his District Native Supervisor of Vaccination and 2 Vaccinators, did plague duty in addition to ordinary duties. Note.-Assistant Surgeon Chandra Shikr with 1 Hospital Assistant and 2 Dhis was posted to the Dunera Plague Inspection Post, but he was relieved by Assistant Surgeon G. C. Chatterjee afterwards when he reverted to Civil duty. SIALKOT DISTRICT. 50. The Silkot District suffered severely from plague during the year 1901-02, 51,914 cases with 34,137 deaths having been reported. Of these 1,685 cases and 862 deaths occurred in the city, 89 cases with 69 deaths in the cantonment of Sialkot, and 50,140 cases with 33,206 deaths in the rest of the district. It was recorded in the Plague Report for 1900-01 that there was no complete dis- appearance of the disease during the hot whether of 1901, though the extent to which it prevailed was not accurately known. By the beginning of October 1901 plague was known to exist in several villages in the Zafarwal Tahsl, and before the end of these months 20 villages were infected. In November plague appeared in the Silkot and Pasrr Tahsls, the Raya Tahsl became infected in December, and the Daska Tahsl in January 1902. The epidemic came to an end in June, no case Laving been reported during July August and September 1902.
?90 Statement No. 2 (Appendix A) shows the number of infected villages, plague attacks and deaths in the district throughout the year. The spread of plague was gradual until January 1902, when a considerable increase took place which continued until the 3rd week in April, 3,652 cases with 2,418 deaths having been reported in the district (exclusive of the city and cantonment) during the week ending April 19th. Towards the end of May the disease began to decline rapidly, and the epidemic came to an end in the last week of June. The progress of the disease differed in different tahsls. In the Zafarwl it reached its maximum in February ; in Raya the highest number of cases and deaths occurred in March ; and in the Pasrr, Silkot and Daska Tahsls the disease occurred in April. Only the Raya Tahsl became free from the disease before June : the last case in this tahsl occurring in May. In the table below are given particulars of certain villages in which the outbreaks of plague were very severe. The severity of the disease varied gradually in different places, both as regards the incidence and fatality of attacks of plague. It should be stated, as will appear later, that the information on this point is very imperfect -: Table showing particulars of villages in the Silkot District in which outbreaks of plague were especially severe.

?91 Besides the  city and cantonment  of Silkot the  head-quarters of the Zafarwl Pasrr, and Daska Tahsils were infected as well as the towns of Chobira in the Zafarwl Tahsl, Sambril, Jmoki and Sumbhowla in Daska Tahsl, and Kila Soba Singh in the Pasrr Tahsl.

(a)    The Plague Medical Officer states that, although greatly alarmed at the spread of plague in their midst, the people gave themselves up to fate and refused to adopt even simplest measures to check the disease, many declaring that all precautionary measures were futile. Added to this was suspicions on all officials of the district. The Deputy Com- missioner, however, remarks that the attitude of the people has been satisfactory, and that the people are beginning to recognise that plague is not brought about by the efforts of doctors and contractors for their own ends. A considerable number of persons, chiefly Bhbrs, fled from Silkot City when the epidemic was severe: flight also occurred from some other infected towns and villages. In a few cases the Hinds, both in the city and elsewhere, abandoned their dead in their flight, and the Municipality of Silkot employed a gang of Jhiwars to cremate dead bodies thus abandoned. Effect on trade, agriculture, &c. (b)  With regard to the effect of the epidemic on trade, agriculture, &c., Mr. Tollinton writes :- " The outbreak of plague undoubtedly had a depressing effect on business in the city. Many Bhabrs and shop keepers removed themselves and their families to non- infected places. A few children were left orphans in the city and were taken to the city poor-house. Cultivation suffered to a certain extent in villages, but the lands of the dead were invariably cultivated. Several cases of organised crime were reported, bodies of villagers sacking and looting the houses of money-lenders who had fled from the plague. There were also doubtless many such cases which were not reported." Precautionary measures, (c)    Very little was  done by the people of infected places to protect themselves from plague. The villagers did not attempt to prevent the entering of persons from infected places, and the only towns in which any efforts were made to exercise surveillance over arrivals were Pasrr and Nrowl.
?92 At Pasrr these efforts, which were due to the influence of the Tahs'ldr, Mr. K. C. Singha, were not long maintained, and the town became infected in January. In Nrowl, however, through the influence of the Reverend C. M. Gough, of the Church Missionary Society, the action of the local Plague Committee was more Sustained, with the result that the town escaped an outbreak of plague although it lay surrounded by infected villages, one of which was only two miles distant. (d)    With regard to the arrangements for obtaining information  concerning plague Arrangements for obtaining information of plague  occurrences Dr. Jones writes:- occurrences. " In this district the usual procedure is for the Lambardr to give information respect- ing any suspicious deaths' in his village through the Patwrs. When he fails in this duty an unusual number of deaths is reported from the thna to the Tahs'ldr. ''The Tahsildar informs us of all such suspected villages and these are then inspected. " Men were appointed to bring in daily reports-each  one  having so many Patwri circles." Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer state that the reporting of plague cases and deaths was very imperfect. The latter writes;- "From examination of the chaukdrs' books it is found that there is a variance be- tween the village books and the deaths sent in by Patwri as being due to plague. Neither are correct, for there are but few put down as plague in the books, and on the other hand, the returns sent in daily have all the deaths occurring on that day put down as plague." The Deputy Commissioner does not consider that there has been much wilful concealment of plague cases except in the initial stages of outbreak in villages ; afterwards cases were freely reported. Evacuation. (e)    The extent to which evacuation was adopted and the thoroughness with which it  was carried  out  varied  considerably  in different villages.  Only a few  villages were completely evacuated. The circumstances of two of them, Aminshah and Bhalolpur, are of interest. Both a population of 331 and both in the Pasrr Tahsil. In the case of Amin- shah the people remained in camps until chemical disinfection of their houses was com- pleted, and only 7 deaths occurred. At Bhalolpur on the other hand, although the people evacuated the village on the first appearance of plague, they returned ten days later owing . to the preaching of a Mullah, and 17 persons died of plague. Partial evacuation which consisted chiefly in those who had wells going to live at them was fairly common, though less in the Silkot Tahsl than elsewhere. In some cases huts were offered to the people, but were often refused, together with all Government aid. Everywhere Hinds evacuated their houses more frequently than Muhammadans, many of the latter objecting to this and other measures on religious grounds owing to the preaching of the Mullah. Even when partial, evacuation was observed to be beneficial, and it was chiefly on account of this observation that such people as did so went to live at their wells. Cordon and guards. (f)    No cordons or guards were employed in connection with evacuated villages. Segregation of sick and contacts. (g) Except in the town of Zafarwl, where, owing to the exertions of the local plague authorities a few persons suffering from plague were segregated with their attendants in the early stage of the outbreak, the segregation of sick and contacts was nowhere adopted. Medical treatment. (h)  In no  case was European medical treatment accepted. (i)    Except in the city comparatively little disinfection, chemical or other, was done Disinfection.                                                   in the Silkot District.
?93 In Silkot City 713 houses, nearly all of them infected, were chemically disinfected. Only 24 villages were completely disinfected by chemical means ; details are shown in the following table ; in addition a few houses were disinfected in some villages at the the request of their owners:- Table showing the number of villages and houses disinfected in the Silkot District.

Dr. Jones mentions some villages in which plague was completely stopped by it, and states that it was very rare for a death to occur in any town that had been disinfected. Captain Hugo, on the other hand, states that though on the whole chemical disinfec- tion was beneficial in Silkot City, several disinfected houses again became infected. He attributes this chiefly to the fact that owing to the opposition on the part of the people personal effects were not disinfected. Whenever employed chemical disinfection was carried out in the manner prescribed in the memorandum on disinfection, and except in one village, where the people asked to be allowed to do their own disinfection, it was performed by a trained gang. In this village- Jandila-disinfectant.s and appliances were supplied, and one trained coolie was employed with any five villagers, the work being done under the supervision of a Hospital Assistant. The result in this instance was not very satisfactory. Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer note that chemical disinfection is unpopular in the district. The former writes:- "Whether the rooted prejudice of the people against the prescribed disinfectant which they say is poison, or against disinfectors whom they suspect of searching for their buried treasure, will ever disappear it is impossible to say." And he adds:- " The only remaining traces of animus in people's minds against plague officials are directed against disinfectors." Dr. Jones mentions that in some places the disinfection has been threatened and hustled off, though requests for disinfection had been received from these villages. In one village, Depoke in the Zafarwl Tahsl, there was a disturbance owing to one section of the village continuing disinfection and the other opposing it: the latter prevailing. In the city of Silkot, however, chemical disinfection of houses was popular except in the early stage of the outbreak, the people understanding its effects and appreciat- ing its benefits. Some people even paid for disinfection by official agency; others bought the materials and carried out the disinfection of their houses themselves. Chemical disinfection of personal effects was very rarely accepted, though a few persons in Silkot City had their effects disinfected with phenyle. In some villages disinfection of rooms by desiccation or by making holes in the Popular methods.                                             roofs was practised with good results. Inoculation, (j)  The total number of inoculations performed in the Silkot District during the year under report was 17,603, of which 1,047 were performed in the city and 16,556 in the rest of the district Among the persons inoculated in the city were many who had come from neighbouring villages, and with these exceptions none of the inhabitants of villages in the Silkot Tahsl were inoculated.
?94 A large proportion of the inoculations in the city, 739, was among persons connected with various missionary bodies-the majority of which were inoculated twice. The number of inoculations performed in each tahsl was as follows :- Raya   4,319 Daska   4,333 Pasrr     4,244 Zafarwl   3,621 Silkot (excluding city)   39   Total 16,556 Of the attitude of the people towards inoculation Dr. Jones remarks that they are beginning to understand that inoculation confers a certain degree of immunity and are gradually getting less frightened of it. He does not mention whether any objections were raised against it on account of religious obligations or social customs, but Captain Hugo mentions that this was not the cause in the city, saying that the people were afraid of inoculation as it was a new thing. Owing to the circumstances which have been mentioned when referring to returns of plague occurrences, much difficulty was experienced in obtaining statistics showing the results of inoculations. Dr. Jones remarks, however, that deaths among inoculated persons are reported. The statistics given by Dr. Jones are embodied in the following table:-   Tahsl. Population. UNINOCULATED. INOCULATED.

Further statistics regarding inoculations in the Silkot District are given in Statements Nos. 5 and 9 in appendices. Infection. (k) Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Plague Medical Officer, while agreeing that human intercourse is the most important feature in the spread of plague, are of opinion that the disease is also conveyed not only within infected places, but from infected to unin-
?95 fected villages by plague-stricken rats. With regard to human intercourse Dr. Jones remarks that on spreading from village to village plague rarely makes a jump of more than 10 miles. He instances as means by which infection is conveyed-visits of condolence or from funeral rites especially by females, when people from uninfected villages either contract the disease or bring any infected clothing, and their admission to uninfected villages of persons who have fled from infected places. Regarding the part played by rats in the dissemination of plague, Mr. Tollinton writes:- " Rats have been noticed immigrating from an infected to an uninfected village in the immediate neighbourhood and dying on the way. Some must have survived: others were found dead on the outskirts of the uninfected village." Also Dr. Jones, who has apparently devoted considerable attention to this subject, writes as follows:- " No constant relation between the extent of rat mortality and attacks of plague among human beings was observed, though in some villages, particularly in Jmke, where there was great mortality among rats, it was noticed that human beings suffered very severely from plague.  Rats, I believe, play an important part in   (a) infecting villages, by the rats of one village emigrating to another village, or even some infected rats of one place mixing with rats of a non-infected place, for it is known that rats do or can infect one another by mixing with one another without any contamination of food; (b) rats secondly form a part in infecting- (1) by contaminating their food; individuals (2) by infected vermin. When they die, these vermin naturally . leave them and make for anything that has life. " Most frequently when a new tahsl becomes infected, the infection is nearly always carried by human agency, rats dying later ; but later on, when the disease becomes fully established, rats die from 2 to 30 days before the men and are always put down by the villagers as the source of infection. " It is rather curious how all the first villages in Daska Tahsl gave a clear history of infection by human agency, and in no place could one get a history of death amongst rats until after the men; and later on how no such history could be obtained the cause of infection being put down to rats. Below are given the first villages infected as A and then a few villages in March-not picked but according to date of infection as B :- A.-Examples of human infection. Name of village.

Dr. Jones does not adduce any facts in evidence of the manner in which plague is contracted by human beings and other animals, but in the case of human beings he surmises that infection may be introduced into the body by pediculi and other body vermin which in his opinion would soon leave a dead body for a living one. He also considers that infection may be introduced by means of infected food or may be inhaled especially in the dust of dried-up sputum of pneumonic plague cases or may enter the body through cuts and abrasions, especially of the hands and feet. Influence of local conditions. (l) The influence of climate and season upon the course and extent of the epidemic in the Silkot District has been immediately noticed already. Of the influence of soil and water-supply Dr. Jones writes as follows:- " Plague was as virulent in Daska if not more so than in any other tahsl. Yet it is an interesting fact that it only attacked the upper two-thirds of the tahsl, the lower third and adjoining territory of Pasrr Tahsl south of Satrah entirely escaping. Now, was this only chance this one-third of the tahsl escaping because infection was not carried there ? I am inclined to think that there is a peculiar factor, and an important one, here, causing ' absence of overcrowding,' "The soil of this part is of quite a different nature to other parts and is only able to be used to cultivate rice. Wells are sometimes miles apart, and water is very scarce. Thus each zemndr possesses very large tracts of land in order to get sufficient to eat and pay his way, and moreover the villages are small and far between. " Hence the nature of the ground forbids overcrowding, and thus tends to check the spread of plague. Moreover, distance from village to village is another important factor against plague, which, owing to the nature of the ground we have here and not elsewhere in the tahsl." It will be seen in the instance quoted that, although the immunity from plague of the third of Daska Tahsl was probably due to the difference between the conditions of its soil and water-supply from that of the remainder of the tahsl, the influence executed was an indirect one, and acted by restricting the density of population and the amount of houses in towns. With reference to the effect of country surroundings of the people upon the epidemic, Dr. Jones calls attention to the immunity from plague of the numerous missionary communities scattered throughout the Silkot District. He remarks that the only difference between the native converts at Daska, Pasrr and other places, and their unconverted relatives in the surrounding villages, is that the former pay more attention to cleanliness, both of the persons and the dwellings, and that their dwellings are better ventilated and less crowded than that of ordinary villages. Yet while plague was raging in the surrounding villages the Christian converts remained unscathed. Without, however, in any way deducting from the value of personal cleanliness and sanitary surroundings as protection from plague, it should be pointed out that Dr. Jones has overlooked another and perhaps more important cause of immunity of these missionary communities from plague, namely, the almost complete absence of intercourse between them and the plague-stricken population by which they were surrounded.
?97 Rat mortality. {m)    The extent to which rats suffered from plague and their relation as to time and extent between outbreak of plague among these animals and human beings has already been referred to. No mention was made of plague among other animals. Dr. Jones states that the people were advised and encouraged to destroy rats, but that nothing was done, as the Muhammadans looked upon plague a visitation of Prov- idence and the Hinds object to destroying the life of any animal. The proportion of bubonic to other forms of plague in the Silkot District is shown in Statement No. 5 (Appendix A).  It will be seen that the bubonic type prevailed. Of the variations in the severity of the disease Dr. Jones writes:- " The virulence of plague varies without rhyme or reason in the various villages infect- ed, sometimes appearing among Mussalmns and sometimes amongst the Hinds according to the caste that first got the infection. " It appears in a most virulent form in one village, another village may become infected form this and have it in a mild form, and vice versa. " In some places-as Jmke-I saw some cases of mild or ambulatory kind, and yet no place had it more virulently than Jamke. " Again, appearing virulently, it leaves suddenly or gradually without any change in the condition or circumstances of the people. " Raya Tahsl became infected before Daska. Yet it kept to a few villages in the north and north-west sides of it, whereas in Daska, appearing later, it spread like wild fire and hung on later in this tahsl than others." Classes affected. (n) Except for the greater prevalence of plague among the poor and among women,, no special reference is made by the Plague Medical  Officer as to  the  liability  to   or immunity from plague of any special classes of the population. Captain Hugo, however, writes that in Silkot City the Khatris and Bhbra com- munities suffered most, and it is mentioned in the Deputy Commissioner's report that more Hindus died in proportion to the population than Muhammadans. Among the latter the classes that suffered most were Arns, Lohrs and labourers. In Silkot City 2 disinfecting coolies were attacked, one of whom died: neither had been inoculated. No universal features of plague were noticed and no opportunity occurred for observing the effects of treatment. Recommendations. (o) The Deputy Commissioner recommends the extensive adoption of inoculation; he also recommends the holding of a darbr at which rewards and sanads should be given to those who signally interested themselves in plague matters. Among the recommendations made by Dr. Jones was the issue to Lambardrs and others of printed sheets of instructions regarding plague, the importance of cleanliness and of avoidance of intercourse with infected places, a desirability of destroying rats, and of avoiding touching bodies of those animals recently died of plague, the necessity for special care to avoid infection from pneumonic cases of plague and other preventive measures. Dr. Jones also recommends the grant of rewards to Zaildrs and others as stimulants to exertions in connection with plague and the employment of officials, such as Nib Tahsldrs, on plague duty and on ordinary district work. Staff and Establishment. The following Medical Officers and sub- ordinates were employed on plague duty in the district:- (1)  Dr. L. Jones, L. M. S. (2)  Assistant Surgeon Mathra Ds. (3)  Assistant Surgeon D. N. Mukhopadhya, with one Hospital Assistant  and   two Compounders. GUJRANWALA DISTRICT. 51. Plague appeared in the Gujrnwla District for the first time during the year under report. The three tahsilsof Wazirabad, Gujrnwla, and Khngah Dogran, including the head-quarters of each tahsl, were infected, and 3,319 cases of plague with 2,244 deaths occurred.
?98 The first case-a fatal one-occurred in the smalltown of Hfizabad, the head-quarters of the tahsl of that name, on November 14th, 1901, having been imported from Kila Sobha Singh in  the  Silkot  District.  Prompt measures saved the town  from infection. The first place in which an outbreak of plague occurred was Ibbrnwli in the Wazirabad Tahsil, where the disease was discovered on February 2nd, 1902. The outbreak was a severe one, and 159 cases of plague with 114 deaths occurred among the 1,501 inhabitants of the village. Ibbrnwli became a centre of infection for the neighbourhood. The town of Wazirabad, with a population of 18,240, became infected on March 22nd, 1902, the outbreak not ceasing until June 30th. One hundred and forty-three plague cases with 122 deaths were reported here. There was an outbreak in 3.3 villages and towns in the Wazirabad Tahsil, with 1,728 cases and 1,095 deaths. The towns infected besides Wazirabad itself were Sodhra,-population 5,313, cases 211, deaths 125 ; Akalgarh,-popu- lation 4,961, cases 58, deaths 43; and Rmnagar,-population 7,131, cases 14, deaths 3. The town of Gujrnwla (population 29,315) was the first place to be infected in the tahsil of that name. Plague broke out here on April 1st, 1902, and between that date and August 13th, 436 cases with 400 deaths were reported. Twenty-two places, including the towns of Gujrnwala and Eminabad, were infected in the Gujrnwla Thsil, and 1,254 cases of plague occurred with 957 deaths. Only 3 cases with 2 deaths occurred at Eminabad. The Khngah Dogrn Tahsil became infected on April 2nd, 1902, when the disease appeared in the village of Shahkot. Only five places were infected in this tahsl, including the tahsl head-quarters, where 2 cases with 2 deaths occurred. There were 337 cases of plague with 192 deaths in this tahsil. Tearing and attitude of the people.- ( )   In his report the Deputy Commissioner,  Dwn Narindra Nth, remarks that although the people feared plague, no panic was caused by the epidemic and fatalistic ideas prevailed. The attitude of the people towards plague measures was fairly satisfactory, and the inhabitants of many villages adopted the advice of the authorities, at any rate in town. No reference is made to any effect upon agriculture or trade, and the epidemic was so small that its effects in the report was likely to have been very slight. Measures taken to prevent outbreaks of plague. (b)    In the early part of the epidemic some villages adopted the suggestion of the Deputy Commissioner of putting guards on the approach to prevent the entrance of persons from infected places. In Gujrnwla Town surveillance over new arrivals was made for some time, and the Deputy Commissioner suggests that this had the effect of keeping some people away, though he admits that the surveillance exercised was imperfect and like the village guards was ineffective. He writes " when persons were determined to come, there was no effectual barrier." Printed copies of the rules authorizing villages to refuse admittance to persons from infected places were circulated to Zaildrs. Methods of obtaining information. (c)  Plague occurrences were reported by Patwrs in the  Gujrnwla tahsl. The returns of some villages were checked by Medi- cal Officers, but no check appears to have been exercised on these returns from the remainder of the district. No reference is made to concealment of cases, though from the high case mortality shown by the returns of several places it was probable that many non-fatal attacks were not reported.
?99 Evacuation.    Segregation. (d) Very little was done either in the way of evacuation or segregation. The Deputy Commissioner  remarks  that segregation  was incomplete , in almost every instance. No European medical treatment was accepted. Disinfection. (e)  Disinfection of infected houses was carried out in several villages and in the town of  Gujrnwla, where 746 houses were disin- fected. The chemical solution of perchloride of mercury was used and was applied by trained disinfecting coolies. The measure was not popular, and the green colour of the solution  was  especially objected to in the town of Gujrnwla.   Its effects were believed to be beneficial. Inoculation. (f) Only 1,958 persons were inoculated in the Gujrnwla District during  the   year under report, and of these 347 were inoculated in Gujrnwala Town. The Deputy Commissioner observes that it was difficult to persuade people to be inoculated. He mentions that the general impression is that it involves an unnecessary trouble, and that people are inclined to put off inoculation to the time when the disease actually breaks out. No injury is reported as having followed inoculation, and no inoculated  person was attacked with plague. Infection. (g) Plague was introduced into the Gujrnw'ala District from the neighbouring district of Silkot, Ibbrnwli, the first infected village, being on the boundary. The town of Gujrn- wla was infected by refugees from Silkot and Jammu. Within the district the disease was spread chiefly by human intercourse, though the Civil Surgeon is of opinion, from the fact that mortality among rats was frequently observed in villages before plague occurred among human beings, that these animals also conveyed infection from one village to another in addition to discriminating it throughout infected villages. Cases were noticed of persons having been attacked with plague shortly after handling dead rats. Local conditions. (h)    Local conditions were not observed to have any influence on the course of the epidemic. Plague among rats and other animals. (i)   As stated above rat mortality was very general in infected villages. Rats were often observed to die in great numbers " from 7 days to a month " before the appearance of plague among human beings. No relation was noticed as to the extent of plague among rats and among human beings. It is stated that rats were caught in traps and their bodies burnt.  Cats are said to have died of plague after eating rats died of the disease. Type and severity of the disease. (j)    The bubonic type of plague prevailed, though it is stated that pneumonic and septic cases were observed at the commence- ment of the outbreak. Classes affected. (k) The poorer classes suffered  most from  plague.  In Gujrnwla  Town  Mahrs (Hindu water-carriers), Bhabrs and Kashmris were chiefly affected. Recommendations. (l)   No recommendations were made either by the Deputy Commissioner or the Civil Surgeon. (m)  The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on plague  duty Staff and Establishment.                                       in the district :- (1)    Lieutenant W. Weston, I.S.M.D., Civil Surgeon. (2)    Assistant Surgeon Ashtosh Datta and one compounder.
?100 Rawalpindi Division. GUJRAT DISTRICT. 52. The Gujrt District was visited by plague for the first time during the year under report, appearing first in a village on the Silkot border early in March 1902 and shortly afterwards in the town of Gujrt. The disease spread to all the tahsl of the district. Outbreak also occurred at Lla Msa and at the towns of Jallpur Jatn and Shdiwl. The epidemic came to an end in July, but early in the following month it again made its appearance in the town of Gujrt which had been free of the disease since the latter part of June. The following table shows the number of infected places, and of plague attacks and deaths in each tahsl:- Tahsl.  Population. Number of infected towns or villages. Population of infected villages. Cases. Deaths. Gujrt  290,839  17  36 786  616  364 Gujrt Town  19,048  1  19,048  82  34 Khrin  242,687  9  8,454  104  76 Phlia   197,974  4   5,561  126  79  Total  750,548  31  69,849  928  553
?101 It will be seen from the table below that the epidemic beginning in March remained until the end of May, after which it rapidly declined, disappearing altogether at the end of July to break out again early in August :-        WEEK ENDING SATURDAY.

?102 Of the course of the epidemic Mr. Baron, the Civil Surgeon, writes:- " The first case of plague occurred in the village of Kaon on 1st March and was found to have been imported from the Silkot District on which it borders. " The village contains 459 inhabitants, and there were 83 cases with 59 deaths. " From Kaon the disease spread to the adjoining villages of Rmbridnwla, Bhilowl, Surakhpur, Jiowanjal and Thatta Msa. " Bahwal was another centre of disease; infection was brought to this village from the Jammu territory. The disease was at first confined to the Hindu portion of the community, afterwards attacking the Muhammadan quarters and on to the adjacent village of Awna. "Another centre of disease was Lla Msa. Here plague broke out in a tannery, situated some 300 yards from the bazr and railway precincts, the disease having been introduced from Wazirabad. The employs scattered in all directions, carrying disease with them amongst other places to Shdiwl, where the outbreak was very severe indeed ; 138 people died of it. Jaklin in the Phlia Tahsil was also attacked with one or two other villages in the same tahsl." Mr. Estcourt, the Deputy Commissioner, writing in July 1902, states that plague never became epidemic in Gujrt Town, all the cases that had occurred up to that time having been imported. When the disease re-appeared in August, however, it became epidemic, 62 cases with 25 deaths occurring during August and September as compared with 20 cases with 9 deaths between March and June. (a)  The people of the Gujrt District are chiefly Muhammadan agriculturists. Of the bearing, attitude and of the effect  of the The people and their bearing in the presence of the     epidemic upon agricultural trade, Mr. Estcourt epidemic and their attitude towards plague measures.      writes :- " As a rule the people were extraordinarily patient while the disease was epidemic in the villages. Their attitude was entirely that of acquiescence. They were willing to take almost any steps they were advised to take so long as some one in authority was present to see it carried out, but if no one was there to see it carried out, they let things go as they were before and did nothing. The Behrpis of Bahwal did more than any others to prevent the disease spreading and only gave way in the face of very severe duststorms. The Hinds of Lla Msa and Shdiwl showed the greatest fear of the disease and fled in all directions as soon as they saw the plague had come to stay. The bazrs at both places were practically closed throughout the epidemic, but as soon as it ceased the bazrs were as full of life as before, and every one returned. Shdiwl is a place of 7,445 people, but when the epidemic was at its height I doubt if there were 2,000 people there. No hindrance to agriculture was caused, nor was there any increase in crimes or litigation. At Bahwal wood was supplied by the District Board to assist the Behrpis to cremate their dead." (b)    With regard to measures taken with a view to prevent outbreaks of plague in un- infected places Mr.Estcourt notes:- Precautionary measures. " The serious outbreak of plague in the Silkot District and in Jammu Territory and the general exodus from both these places made it certain that Gujrt could not hope to escape visitation of plague this year, and during the cold weather all villages were informed of the power they had to prevent persons from plague-infected areas coming into their villages. This privilege was largely availed of, and it was one well understood by the people generally, and to a large extent people from Jammu and Silkot found it difficult to get an entrance to villages unless they were related to  some influential people in the village." In another portion of his report, however, Mr. Estcourt, remarks that the customs of the people were so strong that the danger of contact within infected persons is disregarded as soon as any of their relations were attacked with plague. It is not stated anywhere by the Deputy Commissioner or by the Civil Surgeon that surveillances over arrivals from infected areas were examined in any town in the Gujrt District. From certain remarks of Mr. Estcourt, however, it would seem that some arrangements of this nature were carried out in Gujrt Town. It has been mentioned that all cases which occurred in the town up to the end of June were imported from other places and Mr. Estcourt states that arrangements were made as far as possible through ward mem- bers of the Municipal Committee who segregated their patients in the houses in which they lived.
?103 Methods of obtaining  information concerning plague occurrences. (c)   Information of  plague occurrences in villages was supplied through Patwrs by Lambardrs. The Civil Surgeon, states that in almost all cases the outbreak was first verified by himself or his subordinate. No other check on the returns was exercised. Mr. Estcourt writes:- " I do not think there was any tendency to conceal cases of plague; in fact a number of cases were reported to be plague which were subsequently diagnosed not to be plague." He   mentions however that in some villages in which the pneumonic type of the disease prevailed the people could not be got to believe that plague was amongst them. Evacuation. (d)   Of evacuation Mr. Estcourt writes :- " At both Kaon and Bahwal in the first instance, the people were induced to evacuate their village, but the evacuation was not complete: in nearly every house the oldest man was left behind to act as a chaukdr, and people got supplies from their houses daily. The result was that though the plague was checked to a certain extent, it did not die out, and as soon as the people returned to the village during a storm, the disease broke out again with increased vigour. In no other cases was even partial evacuation carried out except slightly at Shdiwl. Miss Joss, a Missionary lady working at Shdiwl, induced all the Native Christian community to leave their houses completely and formed a camp for them on a site given by a zamndr. A few other people also used chhappars which were sent for the village. At Jaklian every effort was made to induce the people to leave the village, but without success. In many cases the people agreed to leave the village, but procastinated, and when it came to the final point, absolutely refused to leave the village. Segregation. (e)  With the exception of the segregation in their own houses of imported cases in the town of Gujrt to which reference has already been made, there was no segregation of sick or contacts in the Gujrt District. Huts were built outside Gujrt Town for the purpose of segregating plague patients and their attendants, but no body could be persuaded to use them. Disinfection (f)   Preparations were made  or carrying out disinfection on a large scale in the Gujrt District at the beginning of the epidemic ; two disinfecting gangs were fully equipped and a stock of disinfectants laid in. Chemical disinfection. Very little chemical disinfection was done on account of the objection on the part of the people to vacate their houses, and it was particularly limited to places where isolat- ed cases of plague had occurred and the patients had either died or recovered. In Gujrt Town 28 houses and at Lla Msa the railway station and four shops were disinfected. No objection was raised to disinfection. In Shdiwl and a few other places phenyle was used for the disinfection of their houses by the people themselves, and a supply was kept by the Civil Surgeon for selling to the people at cost price. Popular methods of disinfection. In some villages and in the town of Gujrt, a few people tried to disinfect their houses by whitewashing them and by sprin- kling lime on the floor. Others lit fires in infected rooms, and the Deputy Commissioner remarks that the heat generator made in Jammu was well known in the district and thought highly of by the people. Inoculation. (g) Only 1,253 persons were inoculated in the Gujrt District during the year under report. Of these 1,116 were inoculated between March and June and 137 in September. With the exception of 37 persons who were inoculated at Shdiwl and 46 at Lla Masa, inoculation was confined to Gujrt Town where it was performed at the dispensary. The persons inoculated at Gujrt included most of the officials and a number of school boys; the Zaildrs of infected villages were also inoculated. Such inoculation as was confined at Shdiwl was due to the influence of a Missionary lady, who had herself inocu- lated as an example. The persons inoculated at Lla Msa were all railway employs. No inoculated person was attacked with plague, with the exception of one instance, in which an abcess formed at the seat of inoculation; no injury was observed to follow the operation.
?104 Infection. (h) As has been seen, the infection of the plague was introduced into the Gujrt Dis- trict from the neighbouring infected district of Silkot and by refugees from Jammu. In every instance infection appeared to be conveyed by human intercourse, being introduced into new uninfected places either by the refugees from infected places or by residents who had contracted the disease while on a visit to relations suffering from plague. The people of Dhaman in the Khrin Tahsl complained that plague had been in- troduced into the village by means of grain which had been collected from shop-keepers at Lla Msa, loaded on a bullock, which for propitiatory ceremonies was let loose to carry away the disease from Lla Msa and was captured by certain Kumhrs of Dhaman, amongst whom plague broke out. Mr. Estcourt remarks, however, that Kumhrs do a great deal of carrying trade of vegetable between the villages and the shop-keepers of Lla Msa amongst whom plague was violent. Local conditions. (i) No reference is made to the effect of local conditions upon the course and extent of the epidemic; it is most probable that the reason for the comparatively small extent of the epidemic in the Gujrt District is due to the lateness of the season at which infection was first introduced. Mortality among rats. (j) Mortality among rats is stated to have preceded outbreak of plague among human beings in most places. Mr. Estcourt, how- ever, remarks that at two villages, Kaon   and Bahawal, where the pneumonic type of plague at first prevailed, no special mortality among rats was noticed. At Shdiwl, Jakla and Lla Msa, at all of which places severe outbreaks of plague occurred, rats died in large numbers. At Lla Msa the number of dead rats was very large, and frequently the owners of shops left their shops locked, and a large number of dead rats were found in these shops, when they were again opened. No measures were taken to destroy rats ; the people were advised to pour kerosine oil on the bodies of rats found in or about their houses and to burn them on the spot. No other animals were observed to have died of plague. Type and severity of the disease. (k)  Except in the villages of Kaon and Bohwal which have already been referred to and which were the first places to be infected in the district, the bubonic type of plague pre- vailed. In these two villages the first cases of plague occurred were of the pneumonic type. It is recorded by the Deputy Commissioner that the people of Kaon were persuaded to leave their houses and live at their wells, and by March 30th, by which time 28 cases with 25 deaths occurred, it appeared that the outbreak had ceased. On April 9th, however, there was a severe duststrom and the people returned to their houses before they had been disinfected. Plague again broke out among them, but this time only bubonic cases occurred. The difference in the fatality of attacks between the pneumonic 89.28 per cent. and the bubonic 64.15 per cent. type of plague is noteworthy. Classes affected. (l)   Except at Lla Msa where plague was chiefly confined to Hindu shop-keepers and at Shdiwl where the Hinds suffered more than Muhammadans, no classes were observed to be especially liable to or immune from attacks of plague, though everywhere except at Lla Msa and Shdiwl women suffered much more than men. Mr. Escourt suggests that among agriculturist classes men are less exposed to infection than women, as they are at work on their lands all day, but this difference in the liability to exposure does not exist in the case of Hindu shop-keepers who by sitting in the shops all day are exposed to infection equally with their women. No person on plague duty was attacked with plague. Recommendations. (m)  Mr. Estcourt, referring to the  difficulty that was experienced  at Shdiwl in getting infected shops opened for disinfection, owing to their owners having locked them up and fled, considers that power should be given to open such locked premises in the presence of such responsible persons, such as a Tahsldr or Nib Tahsldr, for the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting them. Mr. Estcourt also refers to the complaint of certain small Municipalities, such as Kunja and Dinga, that they were not permitted to refuse access to persons from infected places, as in the case of villages, arrangement could, he thinks, be quite well made by these petty Municipalities without causing much inconvenience. Staff and Establishment. (n) The Civil Surgeon of the district did plague duty in addition to his ordinary duties with one Hospital Assistant and one Compoun- der especially deputed for plague duty in the district.
105 SHAHPUR DISTRICT. 53. Plague first made its appearance in the Shahpur District in October 1901 when an outbreak occurred in the village of Rakron, a village of 1,392 inhabitants in the Bhera Tahsil. It is situated close to the border of Gujrt District whence its infection was probably derived. The outbreak was not reported by the villagers, and was only discovered in February 1902, when the Deputy Commissioner, while touring in the neighbourhood, noticed the high death-rate in the village, and asked the Civil Surgeon to make enquiries. The Civil Surgeon at once proceeded to Rakron and diagnosed plague in its pneumonic form. By the time 393 cases with 183 deaths had occurred. The village was evacuated after some delay and disinfected, and no further cases occurred. The only other outbreak of plague in the Shahpur District was at Alpur, a village of 1,430 inhabitants, close to Bhera. The disease was brought here in January 1902 by some women returning from a visit of condolence to some relations in Silkot District. Twenty-seven cases with 15 deaths occurred here. The disease is reported to have been of the pneumonic type. The same arrangements were made here as at Rakron, with the exception that the village was only partially evacuated. With the above exceptions all the cases which occurred in the Shahpur District were imported from other districts, the number of reported cases amounting to 435, of which 206 were fatal. The following table shows the distribution of all plague cases and deaths in the Shahpur District during the year under report :- Table showing certain details concerning Places infected with Plague in the Shahpur District from October 1st, 1901, to September 30th, 1902.

?106 In every instance these imported cases were promptly reported, and except of Jahanabad all the patients were segregated and the infected houses chemically disinfected. The patient at Jahanabad was a Sub-Overseer in the Irrigation Department. He suffered from only a mild attack of plague and returned to Amritsar before he could be segregated, the building which he occupied was however disinfected. Attitude of the people. (a) From what has been noted above it will appear that the attitude of the people to- wards plague measures was satisfactory. Mr. Bird, the Deputy Commissioner, remarks that the people were generally willing to act on advice offered them, and instances came to light when the people of healthy localities would not admit into their villages or have any contacts whatever with persons coming from infected areas. With this exception, plague made no difference in the habits of the people. The Civil Surgeon states the people preferred their own methods of treatment; the people of Rakron were rejecting the services of a hakm appointed by the Deputy, Commissioner for their benefit. Disinfection. (b) In the village of Firka the people themselves attempted to disinfect their infected houses by lighting fires on the floors and burn- ing sulphur. Disinfection was carried out according to the instructions contained in the memo- randum on disinfection : 112 houses were disinfected. Inoculations, (c) Only 856 persons were inoculated in the Shahpur District during the year. Most of these operations were performed in March and April. The Civil Surgeon remarks that the high temperature of the season was a bar to inoculation in the summer months. Inoculation was chiefly limited to the educated classes, officials, and others. The Civil Surgeon remarks that the " illiterate entertained many absurd ideas " on the subject of inoculation. Infection. (d) In every instance the infection was carried by human intercourses. Local conditions. (c) The Civil Surgeon remarks that the dry soil of the infected places probably pre- vented the spread of plague. Although this may have had some effect, it is possible that it is chiefly due to the attitude of the people towards plague measures, and the promptness with which cases were segregated that the small extent of the outbreak in the Shahpur District is low. Rat mortality. (f)  Rats were reported to have died at Rakron immediately before human beings were attacked.  In no other places was unusual mortality  among rats observed, and no other animals were attacked with plague. T ype and seventy of plague. (g)  As noted above, the cases of plague at Rakron and Alipur were reported to be of the pneumonic variety.  All the imported cases were of the bubonic type. It should be pointed out however that the fatality of attacks at Rakron 46.7 per cent. and at Alipur 55.5 per cent. is much lower than that usually observed in cases of pneumonic plague. It has been mentioned that the disease at Rakron was not reported for some months after its first appearance, and it would seem probable that most of the cases which were not seen by the Civil Surgeon were of the bubonic type of plague, and it is possible that cases of other diseases may have been returned as plague. Staff and Establishment. (h) The following Medical Officers and subordinates were employed on  plague duty in the district:- (1)    Mirn Bakhsh, Utrid, Civil Surgeon. (2)    Assistant Surgeon Shiv Das. Note.-Civil Hospital Assistant Rm Chand did plague duty in addition to his ordinary duties. JHELUM DISTRICT. 54. No indigenous cases of plague occurred in the Jhelum District during the year under report. Two imported cases were discovered and segregated immediately on their arrival. In one case the patient was the wife of a sawr of the XVIth Bengal Lancers, who had been on leave in Ludhina. In the other the patient was a small boy whose parents died of plague in Lla Msa. In neither cases did the disease spread, as prompt and effectual measures were at once taken. The first of these cases occurred on 16th of April and the patient dying a few days later, and the second on May 3rd, 1902.
?io7 In addition to the above cases a plague case in a convalescent state was reported to have occurred at Pind Dadan Khan, from Gujrnwla, and a suspicious case occurred in the house of a shop-keeper in Jhelum City in August 1902. The patient at his own request was permitted to return to the Gujrt District from whence he had just previously arrived. RAWALPINDI DISTRICT. 55. Only two cases of plague, both imported, both fatal, occurred in the Rwalpindi District during the year under report. The first occurred in Rwalpindi Cantonment on April 4th, 1902. The patient was the daughter of a Havild r of the 3rd Punjab Infantry, who with his wife and family had recently arrived from the Ludhithna District. These with other persons coming to the regiment from infected places were segregated by the regimental authorities and the girl developed plague while so segregated. All precau- tions were taken, and no further case occurred in the cantonment. The second case of plague occurred in the Murree Bazr on April 20th. The patient was a Bania who had arrived a few days previously from a plague-infected village in the Silkot District. This man and his family were promptly segregated, the house and its con- tents disinfected, and on the death of the patient his clothes and bedding were burnt. (a) A plague inspection post was established at the 17th mile of the Rwalpindi-Murree Road under Punjab Government Gazette Noti- Inspection of travellers                                               fication No. 75o, dated 25th April 1902.    Lists of travellers passing up this road showing places from which they had come were sent daily to the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Murree Sub-Division and to the Civil Surgeon, Murree, also to the Deputy Commissioner and Civil Surgeon at the head-quarters of the district. Besides this, the Police examined travellers arriving from plague-infected areas at the Rwalpindi and Chak Lla Railway Stations. In the first instance inspections were made at the former station only, but it having been brought to notice that many travellers from infected areas, in order to escape the inspection at that station, alighted at the Chak Lla Station and continued their journey on foot to their homes in the Rwalpindi District, it was deemed necessary to place Policemen on duty there for the safety of the Rwalpindi Cantonment and City. No cases of plague were detected either at the Road Inspection Post or at the Railway Station. The following Medical staff was employed on plague inspection duty on the Murree Road Inspection Post:- Assistant Surgeon Shankar Ds, who on being relieved by Assistant Surgeon Satesh Chandra Nth Ghosh, reverted to his civil duties at the Murree Civil Hospital, and two Hospital Assistants and two Dhis. The Civil Surgeon of the district supervised the working of the post.
?108 Mooltan Division. MIANWALT  DISTRICT. 56.    Only 2 imported cases of plague occurred in the Minwli District  during the year 1901-02.  The first of these cases was the mother  of the Assistant Station Master of Karor who arrived by train from the Silkot District on April 30th, 1902, suffering from plague.  She was immediately segregated with her family and attendants, whose personal effects were disinfected; the railway quarters were also disinfected. The second case was the wife of a postal sorter in the Railway Mail Service, who was brought by her hushand from Lla Msa to Bhakkar on April 28th, apparently while suffering from plague, for when seen by the Assistant Surgeon on May 3rd she was almost convalescent. All the occupants of the infected houses were removed to the Segregation Camp, and the house and its contents disinfected. In addition to the house mentioned above four other houses were disinfected in the Minwli District during the year under report. These were houses to which persons had come from infected places in other districts. None of these persons were attacked with plague, but the Civil Surgeon on hearing of their arrival persuaded them to have their houses and effects disinfected. Disinfection of houses was in all cases carried out with the chemical perchloride of mercury solution: clothing and other personal effects were in some cases boiled in phenyle. JHANG DISTRICT. 57.  The Jhang District became infected with plague for the first time in March 1901. On March 6th two youths,-sons of a shop-keeper at Chiniot Road who had recently returned from Silkot, were taken ill with a disease afterwards diagnosed as plague ; they both died, as did their parents a few days later. Between the date mentioned and the end of the year under report 311 cases of plague with 176 deaths occurred. Except for two latal cases that occurred at Chiniot Road in September, the district was free of plague from the end of May onwards. The number of towns and villages infected numbered 25,-11, including Chiniot Town were in the Chiniot Tahsil, 11, including the towns of Lyallpur and Chiniot Road, were in the Lyallpur Tahsil, and 3 in the Toba Tek Singh Tahsil.  Most of these villages are situated on the Chenab Colony.  These particulars, as well as the number of cases and  deaths in  each tahsil, are shewn in the table below:- Tahsil.

?110 Bearing and attitude of the people (a) The Executive Plague Officer, Lla Sobha Rm, remarks that many of the inhabi- tants of the newly-populated part of the district, to which, as has been mentioned, plague was chiefly confined, were formerly residents of the previously infected districts of Jullundur, Hoshirpur, Gurdspur and Silkot. They were therefore familiar with plague and with the methods formerly adopted for dealing with it. The people were frightened of plague; they took very little trouble to protect them- selves from it, although he mentions that some villiages attempted to keep out persons from infected places with considerable success. Except for the stoppage of the grain market for a few days at Chiniot Road, the epidemic had no noticeable effect upon the prosperity of the district. Information. (d)    Information concerning plague occurrences was obtained through Lambardrs and Patwr's, and was checked by Revenue officials and Hospital Assistants. At first two sets of returns were maintained, one by the Executive and the other by the Medical authorities. There were considerable discrepancies between the two sets of returns, and the former was discontinued. It is stated that, except in the early stages of an outbreak in a village, cases were freely reported, the Civil Surgeon remarking that as the people began to realise that no compulsion whatever was employed, they had no reason to conceal cases of plague. Segregation. Evacuation. Disinfection. Inoculation. (c)    Evacuation was practised in very few instances, and was never complete. Segregation of sick and contacts was not observed, and no chemical disinfection or ino- culation was.carried out. The Executive Plague Officer considers that even such partial evacuation as was practised had beneficial results. Of disinfection, the Civil Surgeon writes:-Disinfection could not be resorted to, as the people objected to vacate their houses and give scope for a fair and thorough disinfection, but they carried out sulphur and cow-dung burning by way of substitute, which they found  more convenient and believed to be just as effectual. No inoculation was done in the Jhang District during the year under report. The Civil Surgeon provided himself with the necessary apparatus and prophylactic, and advocated the measure, but no one came forward for the operation. Infection. (d)    The infection of plague was invariably carried by human intercourse.   As has been seen, it was introduced in the first instance from Sialkot to Chiniot Road.  This place is a railway station and grain market, and from it infection was carried to the town of  Chiniot. Both these places became a focus of infection to neighbouring villages. There was no evidence of the conveyance of infection by grain or articles of merchandise. The Executive Plague Officer remarks that, although Chiniot Road is a grain market, grain is collected here from villages in the neighbourhood, not distributed to them. Influence of local conditions. (e) Local conditions of climate, soil and water-supply are stated to have had no influ- ence on the course of the epidemic. That the disease was chiefly. limited to the irrigated tract is probably due to the comparatively small and scattered population of the remaining parts of the district. Rat mortality. (f)    Of mortality among rats, the Executive Plague Officer writes:-A universal rat mortality was observed generally before the out- break of plague among human beings, in almost all the infected places. In some places it was observed after the outbreak, particularly in Chiniot Town. No interval was usually observed to occur between the death of rats and the   outbreaks of plague among human beings. Type and severity of plague. (g)    The bubonic type of plague prevailed throughout the epidemic, though in the early part of the year some cases of pneumonic plague were observed.  The  Civil Surgeon suggests that this type of plague may have been due to climatic conditions, as it disappeared as the weather grew warmer. Classes affected. (A)    Except in Chiniot Town, where the disease was confined to the Hindu grain- dealers of a particular mohalla, no classes were observed to experience  any special liability to or immunity from attacks of plague. Recommendations. (i)    The Executive  Plague Officer recommends that endeavours should be made  to induce the people to evacuate infected villages by  providing huts for the poorer classes, and that some methods of disinfection should.be devised as may make,it practicable for the people to have their houses disinfected chemically otherwise than by official agency.
?III The Civil Surgeon concludes that, in view of the suspicion with which all measures taken by Government for dealing with plague are viewed by the people, it would be well to withhold assistance until it is asked for. (i)    The Civil Surgeon of the district, Assistant Surgeon Mirza Ashgar Ali, and three                                                Hospital Assistants of the  district, did plague Staff and establishment.              duty in addition to their ordinary duties, with one Hospital Assistant specially detailed for plague duty in the district. MOOLTAN DISTRICT. 58. The following account of plague in the Mooltan District is extracted from the report of Captain Ainsworth, I. M. S., the Civil Surgeon. It will be noticed that Captain Ainsworth is doubtful as to the nature of the disease in the village of Umarpur :- The symptoms he describes however are such as have been observed in the pneumonic type of plague (the pain between the shoulders possibly due to pulmonary inflammation) as is the high rate of fatality, 84.62 per cent. The facts that the disease did not spread widely or that mortality among rats was not observed, are not opposed to the conclusion that the disease was pneumonic plague, and these conditions have been found to be associated with un- doubted outbreaks of this type of plague in India and elsewhere, while the circumstances that plague was prevalent in the adjoining villages of the Bahwalpur State favour this con- clusion. At no time during the year under report did plague obtain a firm foothold in the Mooltan District. On the 15th May a true case of bubonic plague occurred in Mooltan City. It was an imported case from Wan Rdharm, Lahore District. The case and contacts were isolated in an old disused building some distance from the city. The house in which the man had been living was evacuated and disinfected. Strong solution of the phenyle was the disinfectant employed. After the patient's death, the contacts were kept isolated for ten days and their clothing, bedding, &c., disinfected before discharge. The house occupied by the patient and his attendants was subsequently disinfected, beds and bedding used by the patient were burnt and clothing disinfected. The man remained under the treatment of his own hakim. His family willingly submitted to segregation and disinfection measures,-but would   not consent to inoculation. The disease did not become epidemic; no other case occurred. In March a report was received that the Shujabad Tahs'l was infected with plague and that at Umarpur, a village near Jallpur, 6 cases with 5 deaths had occurred. Bahwalpur State at this time was declared to be plague-infected, and as Umarpur is near the Bahwalpur boundary it was thought probable that the disease had spread across. Umarpur was certainly infected from Uch in Bahwalpur. The first case to occur at Umarpur was a Maulvi who used to receive students from Uch. The Civil Surgeon visited the village and saw two or three cases. None of these were typical of plague, and throughout the epidemic in these parts no cases with buboes or pneumonia were noticed, and there was no mortality among rats. The symptoms observed pointed rather to some cerebral or cerebro-spinal affection, e.g., high fever with pain in the head, upper part of neck and between the shoulders, backache, vomitting, restlessness, delirium, and in- some cases convulsions. The disease did not spread with rapidity of plague. In Umarpur 3 cases occurred in two weeks in a population of 944. There were no imported cases. The Maulvi who was first attacked had not been away from the village for Weeks. No cases occurred among the students' who visited him from Uch. There was no panic among the villagers. They were advised to vacate their houses and live in chappars which were erected for them, and inoculation was offered. The disease however subsided and none of these measures were acted on. A hospital in charge of a Hospital Assistant was equipped near the village. Other cases of the same disease occurred in Jallpur itself and in a small basti near. These were imported cases from Bahwalpur State. In the Civil Surgeon's opinion this epidemic was probably epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, and not plague, but it was impossible at the time to settle it by bacteriological examination. The villagers at Umarpur are Syads and averse to any such measures. (a)    The following measures were taken to prevent plague reaching Mooltan. All passengers by rail from the south were inspect- Precau ionary measures.                                            ed at Khnpur.    Fairs which should have been held in this district in March and April were stopped by order of the Deputy Commissioner. Notices were issued to all Hospital Assistants, Thnadirs and Tahsldars to report any suspicious cases at once. Inoculation was not practised to any extent. Only 7 inoculations were performed during the year; probably there would be no difficulty about inducing the people to accept it if the matter were urgent. The subjoined table gives details of plague occurrences in the Mooltan District during the year.

REMARKS Regarding evacuation, disinfection, inoculation, &c. 1 Jallpur   5,149 11th March 1902  1st April 1902  6 4 66.66 Plague is believed to have come from Uch in Bahwalpur State.  The people, though constantly persuaded, did not like to desert their villages. The floors and walls of infected houses were scratched and removed. The clothes of the patients and their relations were disinfected with sajji. Three men were inoculated at Jallpur. 2 Bast Long   424 19th March 1902  29th March 1902  1 1 100   3 Shujtpur   2,352 17th March 1902  27th March 1902 5 3 60   4 Umarpur  962 7th March 1902 28th March 1902  13 11 84.62   5 Mooltan City  74,627 15th May 1902  28th May 1902 1 1 100 Infection came from Railway Station Wan Rdhrm       26 20

?14 There was a steady and almost regular rise in the fatality of attacks from 42'18 per cent, in October to 68.11 percent,  in  April, Variations at different seasons.                                    then a decline, broken by a sharp rise of 73-47 per cent, in June. The apparent increased fatality of attacks in June is most probably explained by the record in this month of the deaths of persons attacked in May, the figures of cases for June being so comparatively small that the addition of a small number of deaths would make a considerable difference in ihe apparent percentage fatality of attacks. Variations   among  different races  or   castes    and sexes. 30.    In Statement No. 3 (Appendix A) the number of attacks and deaths among males and females of  different races and  castes are     shown for alll districts except those of Amba!a and  Lahore, particulars concerning these two districts not having been supplied by the officers concerned. No case of plague occurred among Europeans in the British districts of the Punjab during the year under report, but a European male was attacked in the Patiala State and recovered. From the particulars given in Statement No. 3 (Appendix A) a table No. 4 below has been prepared showing the totals under the different heads and certain calculations based upon them. Excluding Native Christians, the figures for which are so small as to be easily susceptible of error, it will be seen that the classes that suffered most from plague-as judged by the fatality of attacks-were high caste Hindus, Brahmins, Rajputs and Khatris being included in the term, among whom the percentage fatality of attacks of plague was 70*27. Muhammadans suffered rather more than <: Other Hindus", i.e., mostly Jats, agricul- turists, the fatality of attacks among these two classes having been respectively &V04 and 62 43 per cent. Muhammadans suffered rather less than all Hindus taken, the case mort- ality among which was 66'33 per cent. It may be pointed out that the fatality among Muhammadans was very nearly the same as among Chamars and sweepers, all being meat-eating classes. In all the above classes women were more liable to attacks of plague than men, though in the case of high caste Hindus the extra liability is very slight, and it will be noticed that among this class the fatality of attacks was greater among males than among females contrasting in this respect with other classes of Hindus. This difference is probably to be accounted for by the sedentary and in-door lives which many of this class-such as shop-keepers-share with the women ; while the males of other classes of Hindus being mostly agriculturists live out-door lives, their women folk staying at home. Muhammadan females suffered considerably more than males, both as regards their liability to attack and death, more so than in the case ot any other class, for which the seclusion under which they live is most probably responsible. Among Chamars and sweepers although females were more liable to attacks than males, the fatality of attacks among them was less. As far as they go, the figures for Native Christians show not only that the fatality cf attacks among females was less than among males, but that the former were less liable to attacks of plague.

This state- ment also lacks details concerning the Lahore and Ambala Districts. The total figures for each age period with percentage calculations upon them are shown in Table No. 5. It will be seen that at ages between 20 and 50 the fatality of attacks is lowest- being 61.08 per cent.-and that it increases regularly in both directions: 80.39 Per cent. of attacks among infants, and 76.31 per cent. of attacks among persons over 60 being fatal.

?117 After plague had been present in the city some little time, these died in shoals until the drains became choked with them and the maggots crawled up in quantities over the floors from their dead bodies; yet none of the resident zenana ladies contracted the disease, and of the few women who did, it could not be stated for certain that they contracted it within the fort, as they could all have had intercourse with the outside. It is true that a number of these ladies were inoculated, but not all. Had the attacks been in any way proportionate to the mortality amongst rats none should have escaped It is true, however, that the mortality was high amongst those that suffered in the fort, as it is said only two, and they were inoculated, had mild attacks and recovered." At one time rewards were offered for the destructin of rats in Patila City, but this was after the outbreak of plague had subsided, when, it was stated, very few rats were left.  Only 33 rats were produced by claimants of rewards. No other animals are mentioned as having suffered from plague. (l) The type of the disease was  mainly bubonic.  From  what has been stated the  severity of the disease as shown by the fatality Type and severity of the disease.                             of attacks cannot be compiled with accuracy owing to the insufficient information obtained. (m) In concluding his report, Major Hendley Recommendations.                                                               writes as follows:- " For the future there seems to be no doubt but that the measures of most import- ance are in order as given-(1) Inoculation; (2) Restriction of intercourse; (3) Evacuation ; (4) Killing, of rats; (5) Disinfection. Of these inoculation is sufficient in itself, and if the people will only resort to it the remainder will not be found necessary, though they will always prove to be good assistants to it. Every effort should be made to make inoculation popular and to get officials and leading men of all sections to preach its benefits. The people in the villages should be encouraged to keep to themselves, and nothing will be more efficient for this purpose than to extend the provisions of the restrictions which they them- selves are well able to impose upon each other if a breach in a rule made by the whole village occurs. Every attempt should be made to kill rats during these months. Efforts are being made to catch them in traps, but owing to the objection the Hindus have to take life, there are great difficulties in the way. As regards evacuation and disinfection, I do not feel inclined to advise the expenditure of much money on either but in exceptional cases. " The experience in this State as regards evacuation is that the people should be left to their own devices. Any attempt to interfere is looked upon with great suspicion, and the offer of chappars is to most of them much the same as the threat of extortion would be." KAPURTHALA STATE. 61. The Kapurthala State became infected for the second time during the year 1901-02. Appearing on October 19th. 1901, in the village of Panchat in the Phagwara Tahsil, plague spread to several other villages in the tahsil and to the town of Phagwara. Altogether 42 villages and towns were infected in the Phagwra Tahsil, and 2,484 cases of plague with 1,559 deaths occurred between the date mentioned above and the 31st of May, when the epidemic ceased. On January 4th plague broke out at Dhaliwal, a village of 2,742 inhabitants in the Dhilwn Tahsil, about 6 miles from Kaprthala City, and 235 cases with 154 deaths occurred here, the outbreak ceasing in May. In spite of the severity of the disease in the villages, it did not spread, no other cases having been reported from this tahsil. The total number of places infected in the Kaprthala State during the year was 43, the number of plague cases reported 2,719, and of deaths 1,713. In addition some two or three cases suspected to have been plague occurred among new arrivals in Kaprthala City.  These were promptly segregated. (a) The measures taken for dealing with plague were similar to those adopted by the Punjab Government, and until the people realiz- Measures adopted to prevent outbreaks of plague.           ed that no compulsion would be employed they displayed the same dislike and suspicion of State interference as had been observed in British districts of the Punjab. Special measures were taken for the protection of Kapr- thala City; quarantine camps were established on the Kartrpur and Jullundur roads and guards were posted on the outskirts of the city to prevent the entrance of persons from infected places.
?118 The people of uninfected places generally attempted to keep out persons from infect-- ed places, but social and business relations often interfered with the success of these attempts. Measures for obtaining information concerning plague occurrences. (b) Information concerning plague occurrences in villages was obtained from Lambardrs. It is stated that although there was a disposition at the beginning of the season and in the  early stage of outbreaks in villages to conceal cases of plague, they were afterwards freely reported, though less so in towns than in villages. Evacuation. (c) Evacuation of infected villages was common though in most cases it was not com- plete, the people leaving most of their belongings in their houses and frequently returning to fetch supplies. The State provided huts, blankets and food for the very poor who evacuated their houses in accordance with the instructions of the Medical Officers. Segregation. Treatment (d) Segregation of sick and contacts was but sparingly observed.  The people preferred native to European methods of treatment. Disinfection. (e) Chemical disinfection was popular, the  people themselves applying for it, and almost all the infected villages and the infected quarters of the town of Phagwra were disin- fected by the coloured perchloride of mercury solution, applied by special disinfecting gangs. Phenyle was very popular with the people for disinfecting their clothes and persons. In a few instances the people attempted to disinfect their houses by desiccation, light- ing fires on the floors for this purpose. Inoculation. (f) Inoculation was not practised. It is remarked that it was not introduced at first, as Medical authorities in India were not agreed as to its protective properties, but that afterwards when the evidence in its favour grew stronger-especially from the experience in the Jullundur District-arrangements were made to offer inoculation, but by this time plague had begun to decline and no body came forward for inoculation. Infection. (g) The infection of plague was introduced from the adjacent villages in the Jullundur District, and was spread chiefly by human inter- course, often being brought to a village by persons who had attended the funerals of relatives dead of plague and had brought back clothes or other things from infected places. It is suspected that rats introduced plague into some villages as great mortality was observed among these animals in infected villages, the mortality among rats often preceding outbreaks of plague among human beings. NABHA STATE. 62. The Nbha State suffered from a severe epidemic of plague during the year under report. Appearing first in the Amloh Tahsil in November 1901 (but cases and deaths returned in December 1901), it spread widely, and in March invaded the Phul Tahsil and broke out in Nbha City in April. There were outbreaks in 156 places between November 1901 (but cases and deaths returned in December 1901) and June 1902, when the disease disappeared, and 11,769 cases of plague with 10,589 deaths were reported to have occurred. The Amloh Tahsil, which borders on the Patila State and derived its infection from there, suffered most. There were outbreaks of plague in 136 villages in the tahsil with 8,852 cases and 8,178 deaths. Infection was introduced into the Phul Tahsil from Rekot in the Ludhina District where 19 villages were infected and 2,622 cases with 2,213 deaths occurred. The city of Nbha became infected at the end of April 1902 by refugess from Patila.    The number of plague cases reported here' was 295 and of deaths 198.
?119 The table below shows the monthly progress of the epidemic. It will be seen that the disease increased until March and was at its worst in this and the following month : it decreased gradually in May, disappearing altogether in June :- Table showing the Seizures, Deaths and Discharges of the Plague Epidemic in the Nbha State, beginning from the month of December 1901 to the month of June 1902.

(a) Faiz Muhammad Khn, Chief Medical Officer of Nbha State, notes in his report that until plague became severe the people did not pay much attention to it, but at the height of the epidemic the inhabitants of many villages were panic-stricken and fled, leaving their sick uncared for and their dead unburnt or unburied. At first the people were not disposed to co-operate with the State authorities in measures for the suppression of plague, but when they realized that these measures were not compulsory they adopted them more freely. Effect of epidemic. (b) Agriculture suffered greatly and trade was dislocated for a time. Litigation de- creased, but crime, especially thefts, increased considerably, advantage being taken of property left unguarded in the houses of persons who had gone into camp or fled. Precautionary measures. (c) It is mentioned that the people of uninfected villages soon learnt to keep out per- sons coming to them from infected places and kept watch day and night for the purpose, many villages averting an outbreak of plague thereby.
?120 Information. (d) Information concerning plague occurrences was obtained through village officials. The Chief Medical Officer notes that the infor- mation thus obtained was not very reliable, for in the early part of the epidemic cases were concealed, while later many illnesses which were not plague were reported as such. Evacuation. Segregation. During the height of the epidemic evacuation was freely resorted to, and people learnt to avoid contact  with persons suffering from plague. In many villages people fled into camps on finding rats ill or dead of plague in their houses, many thus escaping the disease. Disinfection. (f) No chemical disinfection was carried out in Nbha State, but the people used various means to disinfect their houses, such as making holes in the roofs, lighting fires on the floor, scraping and white-washing the walls, and fumigating their rooms with  sulphur, camphor or burning ' nim ' leaves. Inoculation. (g) The Chief Medical Officer reports that 11,628 persons were inoculated in the Nbha State during the epidemic. Of these only 7 persons were reported to have contracted plague, 1 of whom was suffering from the disease during the time of the operation. Of the remainder 5 are reported to have died within 15 days of inoculation and 1 after a month. Infection. The people were at first strongly opposed to inoculation, but during the epidemic they resorted to it freely, partly as the result of the example set by State officials. As the disease died out, the demand for inoculation decreased and finally ceased. No accident was observed to follow the operations, though in a few persons the re-actionary fever was high. (h) The manner in which infection was introduced into the State has already been referred to; it was spread by human intercourse; there was no reason for suspecting that the disease was being conveyed by grain or other merchandise, except that in a very few instances it was thought that plague was introduced by straw from infected villages. Mortality among rats. (i) Sickness and mortality among rats was observed in many villages-often before outbreaks of plague among the people. It is mentioned, however, that the  people regarded mortality among rats as a warning of the approach of plague and that those who vacated their houses usually escaped an outbreak of the disease. Recommendations. (j) The Chief Medical Officer considers that all compulsory measures for dealing with plague are likely to be ineffectual, but recom- mends that every assistance should be given to those who are willing to receive it, mentioning especially the provision of huts for the poor who cannot make suitable accommodation for themselves when leaving their houses. He recommends desiccation as a means of disinfection of houses. KALSIA STATE. 63. The Kalsia State consists of two parts, one of which comprising the Bassi and Chachrauli Tahsils borders on the Ambala District ; the other part, the Chrilia Ilqa, is an island of villages in the Ferozepore District. Both portions of the State were infected with plague during the year 1901-02, and in both the plague arrangements were placed under the direction of the authorities of neighbouring British Districts, the Sardr and officials of the State cordially co-operating. A Civil Assistant Surgeon was lent by the Punjab Government to the State for employment on plague duty in the Bassi Tahsil.
?121 There were outbreaks of plague in 37 villages in the State, and 2,882 cases of plague with 2,170 deaths occurred. The monthly progress of the epidemic is shown in the table below :- Table showing Monthly figures by Tahsls in the Kalsia State from 1st October 1901 to 30th September 1902. Month. Tahsl.

Commencing early in January 1902, it lasted until the end of June, and 34 villages with a population of 16,501 were infected, and 2,583 cases of plague with 1,971 deaths occurred. The incidence of attacks to the population of infected villages was thus 15-65 per cent., and the percentage fatility of attacks was 76.30. The town of Peri Bassi, with a population of 4,643, suffered severely. This was the first place in the State to be infected, and the outbreak lasted until towards the end of May : 482 cases of plague with 412 deaths occurred here. Only three villages in the Chiraklia Ilqa were infected. These had a population of 4,798, and 299 cases with 198 deaths occurred. Plague did not break out in this part of the State until April 1902, and the outbreak ceased early in June. The arrangements for dealing with plague were similar to those in the adjoining British Districts, and no separate description is called for. One thousand three hundred and Forty-seven persons were inoculated in the Bassi Tahsl. The people were somewhat distrustful of the operation, and those that submitted to it only did so after an example had been set by the Sardar and the State officials. MALERKOTLA STATE. 64. Plague first appeared in the Mler Kotla State in January 1901, when two per- sons suffering from the disease came to the city of Mler Kotla from the Ludhina District. These two persons were promptly segregated, and no further cases occurred in the city; but in February plague broke out in three villages and the disease did not completely disappear during the year under report. During the year there were outbreaks in 56 villages and 2,217 cases of plague with 1,798 deaths occurred.
?122 The Superintendent of the State reports that although the people were very frightened of plague, they did very little to protect themselves from it, though the inhabitants of some villages took advantage of the power conferred upon them of refusing access to persons from infected places and thereby averted outbreak of plague. The State tried to diminish intercourse between infected and uninfected villages by having shops opened near infected villages where the people could obtain daily necessaries and by keeping guards on the high roads. BAHAWALPUR STATE. 65. Plague made its first appearance in the Bahwalpur State in January 1902, but was not reported until the following month. The outbreak was fortunately a small one and ceased early in April. The disease was limited to 45 villages, and only 336 cases of plague with 170 deaths were reported. The monthly cases of the epidemic are shown in the table below.

He soon died, and the disease spread first to his relatives and then to other persons in Uch and its suburbs, whence it was carried by human intercourse to other places,-Ahmadpur, the head-quarters of the tahsl of that name, and Bahwalpur itself being among the number. Bearing and attitude of the people. (a) The people co-operated with the authorities in measures for dealing with the disease, and to this is attributed the small extent of the outbreak. It is remarked that the "disease created no feelings of panic and nothing occurred to disturb the tranquility of the popu- lation." Precautionary measures. (b) The inhabitants of uninfected villages endeavoured to prevent the access of strangers, and Police guards were placed on the outlets of infected villages to restrict communication between their inhabitants and those of infected places. The remark is made that " although this was detrimental to some extent to trade and other business, it had the most beneficial effect in preventing the spread of the disease. " Information. (c) The Municipal Commissioner, Rses, Mohalladrs, Zaildrs and Lambardrs were held responsible for reporting plague occurrences, and no difficulty was experienced in obtaining information, as this is attributed to the knowledge of the people that no compulsory measures would be employed.
?123 Evacuation. (d) No villages were evacuated, but the people of some villages are said to have left them by day, during which fires were lighted in the houses, and to have returned at night. Segre- gation of sick or contacts was not observed, nor was chemical disinfection or inoculation practised. In some instances the people made holes in the roofs of their houses, or where these were of thatch the roofs were lifted half a yard from the walls to admit air and sun light. In some places also, as has been mentioned above, fires were lit in infected houses to dis- infect them. These measures are stated to have been very beneficial. Rat mortality. Mortality among rats was observed only at Uch, where plague first appeared, and where the outbreak was not severe. Deceas- ed rats were also observed here concurrently with the outbreak of plague among human beings. JIND STATE. 66. Plague appeared for the first time in the Jind State in February 1902, when it broke out in Sangrr City. The disease was limited to the city and to 12 villages in the Sangrr Tahsl. The epidemic ceased in June 1902, 761 cases of plague with 540 deaths having occurred. The table below gives the number of infected places, cases and deaths monthly throughout the epidemic.

The outbreak was at its height from the middle of March to the middle of April, declining rapidiy in May and ceasing in June. Some places suffered more severely than others. In Sangrr City, with a population of 11,852, where active measures were taken, only 61 indigenous cases occurred; while at Ghbadur, a village of 1,201 inhabitants, 364 persons were attacked with plague. The disease was concealed here for a long time, and the people could not be persu- aded to adopt any measures to check it  In this village several fields were left without owners, and the cattle had no one to look after them. Measures taken to prevent outbreaks of plague. (a) The people of uninfected villages placed guards on the approaches to prevent the entry of persons from infected places. Except in Sangrr Town where almost every case was promptly isolated and practically the whole city was evacuated and disinfected, very little was done to check the disease. No village was completely evacuated, but in some villages where a case of plague occurred the inmates of the neighbouring 6 or 7 houses went out into the fields, for a few days.
?124 (b)  In Sangrr City houses were disinfected with the coloured perchloride of mercury                                                                 solution, and later with phenyle 1 in 50,partly Disinfection.                                                           because the people believe that the green colour killed healthy rats and spread the plague infection, partly because the phenyle solution was more easily prepared and could be used for all kinds of things. Only three villages were chemically disinfected, the people refusing to vacate their houses. When people refused chemical disinfection they were advised to light fire in their houses and burn nm leaves and sulphur. (c) Dr. Dhingra states that inoculation was popular at Sangrr, and 2,655 persons in- Inoculation.                                                            cluding many pardah ladies were inoculated in the State. In the villages inoculation was not popular, and only about 200 villagers were inoculated. Only two inoculated persons contracted plague, both of whom recovered. No injury was observed ;to 'follow 'the operation, though many rumours were afloat as to its bad effects. (d) Dr. B. L. Dhingra, the Chief Medical Officer of the State, notes that infection was introduced and spread by human agency, infection                                                                 the first cases having  been imported into Sangrr City from Ludhina, and plague was introduced into villages later by persons from the Ludhina District and from the towns of Mler Kotla, Patiala and Nbha. He suspects that in some instances infection was conveyed by grain, as the disease appeared in villages shortly after grain had been brought from infected places, the grain having been stolen in some instances. It is mentioned, however, that the person who bought the grain was the first to suffer from plague, and it is more likely therefore that they contracted the plague in infected places than that they carried infection in the grain. (e) Mortality among rats was observed six days before the outbreak of plague Mortality among rats.                                              among human beings at Sangrur.    The rats first died in the wheat market, and Dr. Dhingra suspects that infection had been imported by the grain which had a few weeks previously been brought from infected villages Rats died in every street and lane in Sangrr, but in all cases in which evacuation was done immediately on the discovery of dead rats or dying rats no human being was infected. The contrary was the case when advice as to evacuation was not followed. In the villages rat mortality was observed to be simultaneous with the outbreaks of plague among human beings. Cats and dogs are said to have died of plague in these villages. NATIVE STATES UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENT, HILL STATES. 67. Of the Native States under the Superintendent, Hill States, Nlgarh and Baght were infected. In the former the first case occurred on 5th March 1902 and the last on 25th May 1902. In the Baght State there were only 4 cases in all, of which 2 were doubtful, but these were considered as having actually been plague cases. The first case occurred on 9th March 1902, and the last on 1st May 1902, though returned in April. (a)  The outbreak in the Nlgarh State was limited to the town of Nlgarh (population 4,027) where  between the date  mentioned Nlgarh State                                                                  above 263 cases of plague with 206 deaths occurred. Infection was probably introduced from Rpar. Very little was done by State authorities to check the outbreak. The Rja retired to Rmgarh Fort, and most of the State officials left the town. The only measures that appear to have been adopted by the people themselves were that about 300 persons went into camp for about 10 days, and that in a few instances the occupants of infected houses tried to desinfect them by burning nm leaves in the rooms. Mr. Craik, Assistant Commissioner, who was deputed to visit Nlgarh, reported that practically all the well-to-do people bolted, with the result that plague appears to have been more or less at a standstill and the poorer people were left in great want. (b) The cases of plague in the Bhagt State were all among employs of the Simla-Klka Railway. Two of these cases occurred at  Bhgat State.                                                                          Koti, and two at Jabli; all were fatal. In the case of Koti, the cases of plague (2 only) occurred among the railway gangs working near Koti Tunnel on March 9th. The gang affected had lately come from Klka, and must have brought the infection from that place, which is only 7 miles off Koti. In the case of Jabli, 9 1/2 miles from Klka on the Simla road, the two cases occurred in the family of Bbu Tehl Singh, Sub-Overseer, Jabli Sub-Division, Klka-Simla Railway. The disease is suspected to have  been imported by a Bania in a consignment of grain from some infected area.  Immediately after the arrival of this grain rats commenced dying.
?125 In the case of the Koti outbreak, the whole gang of coolies affected was isolated by the Assistant Engineer of the Simla-Klka Railway in a camp specially chosen by him and watched by Chaukdrs in his service. Similar precautions were taken by the Railway authorities in the Jabli outbreak, and it is undoubtedly owing to this that the disease did not spread. At Koti all rags, clothes, &c., belonging to the gang were burnt or boiled. The huts in which they were living were burnt; all houses, clothes, &c, of other gangs working in or near the Koti Tunnel were disinfected in phenyle or white-washed. The houses at Jabli in which the cases occurred were disinfected by official agency (vis., the Assistant Surgeon at Klka) with the prescribed solution of perchloride of mercury. The Assistant Surgeon was sent to perform this disinfection at the request of the Railway authorities. Punjab Government Press Lahore-24-2-04-404.
