?APPENDIX VII. MEASURES OUTSIDE THE BOMBAY PRESI- DENCY. CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL ABOUT SEGREGATION AND THE REVISED BENGAL PLAGUE REGULATIONS. No. 1. No. 286-T. M., dated Darjeeling, the 3rd June 1897. From-H. H. RISLEY,  Esq., C.I.E.,  Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal (Medical) Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. In Mr. Thornton's letter No. 1181 of the 2nd April, the Govern- ment of India suggested that either Dr. Lowson or Dr. Reade, who had worked at Hongkong during the outbreak of plague at that place, and had "given most valuable advice to the Government of Bombay," should pay a visit to Bengal for the purpose of advising this Government. In my letter of the 13th April, the Lieutenant- Governor expressed his wish to have the advice of Dr. Lowson on the question of the measures to be taken in the event of plague spread- ing to Calcutta. 2. Before this correspondence took place the Lieutenant-Gover- nor had already had under consideration the question of modifying some of the regulations issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, in the light of the experience gained in combating plague in Western India. That experience seems to show that the distinction between isolated cases and a well-defined outbreak, which was recognised when the Bengal Regulations Nos. 4 and 5 of 10th February were framed, cannot be safely maintained, and that whatever precautions may be authorised by law should be brought into force directly a single case occurs. Regulations Nos. 6 and 7 of the 12th March are, it is true, not based upon this distinction, but they are not as comprehen- sive as Nos. 4 and 5 of the 10th February, and in respect of segrega- tion they are far more severe. It also appeared desirable that the Bengal regulations should conform as closely as possible to those in force in neighbouring provinces.
4               Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.     [ APP. VII. 3.  While these points  were  being  considered,  representations were  received  from  the Muhammadan   community  and the   Indian Medical Association on the subject of  the  regulations,   and   it  came in  various ways to the Lieutenant-Governor's notice that some alarm had  been   caused  among both   Hindus   and   Muhammadans  by the prospect of the existing plague regulations, especially those relating to segregation, being brought into force.    In order to allay the apprehen- sions of the native community, without abating the stringency of the measures necessary to combat the plague successfully in this province, the Lieutenant-Governor caused a fresh set of rules to be drafted and circulated  to  a  number  of  representative Muhammadan gentlemen for opinion.    A deputation of Muhammadans was at  the  same  time received  by  the Secretary to this Government, who on two occasions discussed at great length with them and   with  the   Commissioner of Police,   Calcutta,   and the Chairman of the Calcutta Municipality, the points which they considered open to objection in  these   draft  rules. They  have  since submitted a memorial which, with the letter of the Indian Medical Association expressing the views of  the Hindu  com- munity,   is enclosed   in  original.    These  memorials have been fully considered, and the requests therein made have, as far as practicable, been given effect to in the enclosed draft Regulation No. 8.* 4.  Just as the regulation was ready for publication, Dr.   Lowson arrived   in   Bengal,   and   the Lieutenant-Governor thought it right to consult him on the subject.    After making a thorough   inspection   of Calcutta  and   Howrah  with  reference to the facilities for combating an outbreak of plague in either town, Dr. Lowson has   expressed  his views   on  the   subject of  segregation  in  the letter of the 1st June, copy of which is annexed.*    It will be seen  that in   his   opinion  the system of home segregation authorised by rule 31 of the draft regula- tion is likely to prove absolutely ineffectual in  the  event  of  even  a few  cases  of  plague occurring, and that to proceed on these lines is to  court  disaster.    The   Lieutenant-Governor  fully  recognises  the social   and   political  objections to   enforcing  immediate  removal   to hospitals  and   segregation  camps,  and at first he declined to modify the regulation to meet Dr. Lowson's views; but after once more  per- sonally  discussing the question   with him, Sir Alexander Mackenzie is driven to the conclusion that no system of home-segregation  could be  successfully  worked   in Calcutta.    It would seem to be unwise to reject the teaching of experience in a matter of this  importance,  and Dr. Lowson attributes   much  of the   mortality  in Bombay  to  futile efforts in this   direction   in   the   early  stages  of  the epidemic,   and failure  to  realise the  imperative necessity of isolating at the earliest * Not printed.

His  Honour  is  disposed, therefore, to substitute for rule 31 the following:- "If on examination of a sick person the Health Officer suspects that such person is suffering from or infected with plague, he may cause such person to be removed to a hospital, and may arrange for his detention, dieting and medical treatment therein. He may also cause the other occupants of the house in which such person resides to be removed to a segregation camp and to be detained under observation for ten days. "When particular castes or classes of the community have constructed at their own cost private hospitals and segregation camps, the site and plan of which have been approved by the Health Officer, and have arranged, to that officer's satisfac- tion, for the medical administration of such hospitals and camps, sick or suspected persons may, if they so desire and if accommodation is available, be removed to the private hospital or segregation camp constructed for the use of the caste or class to which they belong instead of to a public hospital or camp. "In both public and private camps and hospitals separate and suitable accom- modation shall be provided for females, and in the case of a female who, by the custom of the country does not appear in public, her parda shall be strictly preserved both in removal to the camp or hospital and during her stay there. The friends and servants of sick persons shall be permitted to accompany them to hos- pital, but shall be subject to the same rules as regards segregation as if they were sick themselves." 5. The Lieutenant-Governor believes that  the  above  rule  con- cedes   everything that   can   reasonably  be   demanded by the higher classes of Hindus and Muhammadans.    If, as Dr. Lowson has   urged, the  hospitals and   camps  are   established  in   available  open spaces near the houses of the sufferers, but little hardship  will  be   involved in   insisting  on   removal  thereto.    As, however, the Government of the North-Western Provinces has adopted what Dr. Lowson declares to be a hopelessly impracticable scheme    of  home-segregation,   and has  thereby  greatly  increased the political difficulty of introducing more stringent measures, I am  desired  to   submit  the  question  for the  orders  of  the  Government of India.    The Lieutenant-Governor is not prepared to adopt a system  which  the  expert   placed   at  his disposal  declares  to  be fatal in its results and condemned by all ex- perience.    There appear to be three possible courses open to us:- (1) To enact the draft  regulation  as   it stands, trusting  that the  plague  may  not reach Calcutta and Howrah, or, if it does, that the clause   requiring deposit of the cost as a condition  precedent  to  house-segregation  will deter all but a few families from applying for the privilege.    It may be   added that should an outbreak occur the panic would be so great that the most stringent  measures might then be  adopted without provoking resistance, but by the time the disease had spread to the extent of causing a  panic it would probably be too late for segregation to be of any use.

This will undoubtedly be unpo- pular, and it may be said that if Calcutta escapes plague the prejudices of certain classes of the people will have been excited to no purpose. This, however, is the course which, in the Lieutenant-Governor's opinion, ought to be followed, and it can be justified by the experience of Western India. (3)  To leave things as they are, relying on the rules  contained in Plague Notifications Nos. 6 and 7 of the 12th March for the legal means of dealing with plague cases. In Dr. Lowson's opinion, rule 2 of Regulation No. 6 and rule 3 of Regulation No. 7 are sufficient to secure the isolation of sus- pected cases. The reporting of cases has been provided for in the mufassal by executive order, and in Calcutta by rule 2 of Regulation No.7. The weak point of both regula- tions is that they make no provision for the immediate enforcement of the sanitary precautions contained in rules 17 to 20 inclusive of draft Regulation No. 8, but under executive orders issued some months ago, all the chief mufassal municipalities have done as much general clean- ing up as their funds permitted, while in Calcutta, as the Government of India are aware, a special staff has been employed since last October to remove accumulations of filth. If this course were adopted, the memorialists might be told that, as plague is now disappearing in the west of India, the Lieutenant-Governor does not think it worth while to modify the existing regulations. 6. I am to ask that a very early reply may be sent to this refer- ence. If the Government of India accept without material modifi- cation any one of the three courses specified above, I am to suggest that  orders   might be communicated by telegram.   The return of the papers enclosed in original is requested. No. 2. No. 1768, dated Simla, the 30th June 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal (Medical) Depart- ment. I am directed to address you in continuation of my telegram No. 1692, dated the 15th instant, on the subject of the proposed modi- fications of some of the plague notifications issued by the Govern- ment of Bengal under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.
APP. VII. ]      Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.               7 2.  It appears from your  letter  that the   Government of   Bengal has considered the modification of these notifications from two points of view.    In the first place His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor  consi- ders that the experience that has been gained   of  the   plague  shows that the distinction between isolated  cases and a  well-defined out- break which was recognised when the Bengal Regulations Nos. 4 and 5 were framed cannot be safely maintained, and that whatever precau- tions may be authorised by law should be brought into  force  directly a single case occurs.    It is pointed out that, although the subsequent Regulations Nos. 6 and 7 of the 22nd March are not based upon  this distinction, they are not as comprehensive as Regulations Nos. 4 and 5, and in respect of segregation they are far more severe. 3.   In   the  second   place  representations  were  received  by  the Government of Bengal from   the Muhammadan community and   the Indian Medical Association on the subject of the   regulations,   and  it came in various ways to the Lieutenant-Governor's notice that some alarm had been caused among both Hindus   and   Muhammadans by the  prospect  of   the existing plague  regulations,  especially  those relating to segregation, being brought into force.    After  considering the objections taken to the existing rules and consulting the heads of the native community, the Government  of  Bengal  drew  up   a  new draft regulation numbered 8, a copy of which is forwarded  with your letter.    Rule 31 of this draft deals with   the subject  of  segregation, and provides that the isolation of the sick may be carried out in, or in the immediate neighbourhood of, their own homes, if there is suitable accommodation for such isolation, and if a sum sufficient to  meet the probable expenses of isolation is   deposited.    Just  as  the regulation was ready for publication, Dr.    Lowson  arrived  in  Bengal and  the Lieutenant-Governor consulted  him  on  the  subject.    Dr.   Lowson expressed views strongly adverse to  the  proposed  system  of home- segregation which he considered likely to prove absolutely ineffectual in the event of even a few  cases of  plague    occurring.    His Honour the  Lieutenant-Governor, after   discussing  the   question  with  Dr. Lowson, was driven to the conclusion that no system of home-segre- gation could be successfully worked in Calcutta, and  is  disposed  to substitute for rule 31 of draft Notification  No. 8,  the  rule  set forth in paragraph 4 of your letter.    That rule provides for the compulsory removal of all persons suffering from,  or  infected with, plague to a plague hospital maintained  either  by the Government  or by some particular caste or class of the community.  His Honour the Lieutenant- Governor submits the question for the orders of the  Government of India with the remark that he is  not  prepared  to adopt a system which the expert placed at his disposal declares to be fatal in its resultsand condemned by all experience.
8               Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.      [ APP. VII. 4. I am in the first place to explain that Dr. Lowson is in no sense the representative of the Government of India. The Govern- ment of India have never expressed their adherence to his views, nor have they accredited him to Local Governments with the object of expressing to them the views of the Government of India. The Government of Bombay informed the Government of India that Dr. Lowson's experience had been useful, and suggested that other Local Governments might wish to avail themselves of it. The Government of India had no objection and circulated the suggestion. But it was no part of their intentions that the Local Governments should do more than consider on its merits any suggestion Dr. Lowson might make, and the danger of following his advice without giving full considera- tion to aspects of the question which would not occur to him is illustrat- ed by the tone of his letter of June 1st, and by his condemnation of the rules prescribed for the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. The form of the rules in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh was dictated by considerations with which Dr. Lowson was absolutely unfamiliar, and the Government of India can conceive nothing more dangerous than to rely in a matter of this nature on the advice of a medical expert who shows himself so little able to appreciate the position of the Governments in India as to be prepared to entirely ignore political reasons. 5. The Government of India wish it to be understood that it is for the Government of Bengal to thoroughly inform itself and finally advise as to what measures can be safely taken in the matter of segregation. It has, on the one hand, to consider the danger of the spread of plague and the question whether and to what extent home- segregation could be enforced. On the other hand, it must take into account the state of feeling in the province and the extent to which political disaffection and disorder are to be apprehended from the enforcement of a rule rendering every person suspected of suffering from, or being infected with, plague liable to be sent to hospital. The Governor General in Council, on the information at present before him, is disposed to agree that segregation is the best pre- ventive measure that can be devised, and that if it is to be enforced in a place like Calcutta segregation in hospital is essential for the greater part of the population likely to be affected. But His Excellency in Council considers that in carrying out any measures of segre- gation due regard should be had, as in the case of Europeans, to the position in society of those classes of the native community who can be relied on to take efficient measures with the object of preventing the spread of infection, and to other considerations of a like nature. 6. There is another respect in which it appears to the Govern- ment of India that the draft rule set forth in paragraph 4 of your letter
?APP. VII. ]     Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.                9 should be made more explicit, if it ever becomes necessary to intro- duce and enforce it. They consider that it should be clearly stated that the hospitals, whether Government hospitals or private caste hospitals, should be so arranged as to provide accommodation for the immediate family of the patients. The percentage of fatal cases among plague patients is so high that the Government of India cannot regard it as humane to separate the sufferers from their families and friends, and the Governor General in Council apprehends that such enforced separation of relations and friends may be at the bottom of much of the agitation against the rules requiring segregation, and that it leads to dangerous concealment of disease. 7. In paragraph 5 of your letter it was stated that three possible courses appeared to be open, and it was suggested that, if the Govern- ment of India accepted any one of these courses without material modification, the orders might be communicated by telegram. In my telegram No. 1692, dated the 15th instant, it was stated that the Government of India considered that the third alternative course-to leave things as they are-was the best. It appeared to the Govern- ment of India that, if His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor considered that the modified rule enforcing segregation in hospitals was neces- sary, it would be unwise to issue the rule in Notification No. 8, per- mitting home-segregation; and, on the other hand, that, as the great diminution of the plague in the Bombay Presidency has made the danger to Calcutta remote, it is unnecessary at the present juncture to excite disaffection by publishing a rule which it may never be necessary to enforce. At the same time it may be well to have the regulation in readiness should it ever be required, and the Governor General in Council will be glad to be favoured with any revised proposals His Honour may desire to make after he has considered the observations contained in this letter.

?10             Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.      [ APP. VII. 2.  In paragraphs 5 and 6 of the  first  letter the   Government   of India make certain  observations  and   suggestions as to the   general policy to be followed and the particular measures to be adopted in the matter of segregation. Paragraph 7 of the same letter explains the decision of the Government of India (which had already been communicated by telegram) in respect of the publication of the draft Regulation No. 8, which was submitted with my letter No. 206-T. M., dated the 3rd June 1897. It is further stated that it may be well to have the regulation in readiness should it ever be required, and that the Governor General in Council will be glad to be favoured with any revised proposals the Lieutenant-Governor may desire to make after considering the observations contained in your letter. 3.  In order to give all  classes of  the native community  in Cal- cutta the fullest opportunity of expressing their views on the question, representatives of the Bengali Hindus, the Muhammadans, the Jains, the Marwaris, and the Parsis were invited to meet the Medical Board on the 2nd September last, for the purpose  of  discussing  informally the draft rule relating  to   segregation,   which had   meanwhile been amplified so as to include the following concessions:- (1)  that relatives,  friends,   hakims, and  priests of  sick persons should be allowed free access to them during the day- time; (2)  that members of  the   family in attendance on a sick person should be admitted to hospitals, but should be required to sleep in suitable accommodation provided in the com- pound; (3)  that  the hospitals   need  not be in   remote  or inconvenient situations. 4.  The entire regulation was laid before the meeting, but the dis- cussion was confined to the   provisions relating to segregation,   and none of the other rules were objected to.    The representatives of the Bengali Hindus pressed for the recognition  of home-segregation on the ground that the  social customs of the people of Calcutta differed greatly from those of the people of Bombay, and the   Hon'ble   Babu Surendra Nath Banerjee   put  forward two   suggestions designed to bring about this result:- (a) "that the word 'hospital' in the rules should be held to mean any place or house, not being merely a room, with a courtyard, or, if standing apart, without a courtyard, which has been set apart with the approval of a com- mittee of three experts, of whom one is the Health Officer, for the reception of plague patients and their attendants, and which is not used as a dwelling-house;
?APP. VII. ]      Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.               11 (b) "that inmates of infected houses should be allowed to remain under observation ten days in any uninfected houses chosen by themselves and approved of by medical experts at their own expense." 5. The Lieutenant-Governor is clearly of opinion that neither of these proposals can be accepted. Their practical result would be to introduce home-segregation on a large scale, and to multiply the so- called "hospitals" to such an extent that no effective control could be exercised over the intercourse of plague patients and suspects with uninfected members of the community. At the same time the Lieutenant-Governor feels much sympathy with the desire of the upper classes of natives that in guarding against spread of plague in Calcutta as little violence as possible should be done to their social traditions and usages, and he is anxious to make every concession that is consistent with the paramount duty of preventing the spread of the disease. With this object rule 31 of the draft Regulation (46 * of that now submitted) has been further amended to the following effect:- 46. Segregation.-(1) If on examination of any person the Health Officer suspects that such person is suffering from or infected with plague, he may cause such person to be removed to a hospital, and may arrange for his detention, dieting and medical treatment therein. He may also cause the other occupants of the house in which such person resides to be removed to a segregation camp and to be detained under observation for ten days. In the case of  parda- nashin ladies a lady doctor shall conduct the examination. (2) When private plague hospitals or segregation camps have been provided and fully equipped by or for particular castes, classes, joint families, or associations of families, and the Health Officer, or in Calcutta two members of the Plague Commission empowered for this purpose by the President, have in writing ap- proved of the site, plan, furniture and arrangements for medical administration of such hospitals and camps, sick or suspected persons may, if they so desire and if accommodation is available, be removed to the private hospital or segregation camp constructed for the use of the caste, class or family to which they belong, instead of to a public hospital or camp. (3) In both public and private camps and hospitals separate and suitable accommodation shall be provided for females, and in the case of a female who, by the custom of the country, does not appear in public, her parda shall be strictly preserved both in removal to the camp or hospital and during her stay there. (4)  The relatives, friends, hakims, and priests of sick persons shall be allowed free access to them during the daytime,  subject only to such  precautions as the Health Officer may consider necessary. (5)  Members of the family of a sick person who are in attendance on him may also be admitted to the hospital, whether public or private, provided  that they shall sleep  in the compound   in suitable accommodation provided for the pur- pose, and not in the hospital itself. * Appendix IV.
?12             Measures outside the Bombay Presidency.      [ APP. VII. Explanation 1.-It is not necessary that hospitals provided in accordance with this rule should be constructed in remote or inconvenient situations. Explanation 2.-Persons desirous of taking advantage of clause (2) should at once communicate with the Plague Commission, and satisfy that body of their ability to provide adequate hospitals and camps when plague breaks out. Explanation 3.-Private hospitals and camps may be closed by order of the Plague Commission, if the Health Officer reports that medical attendance and segregation are not maintained to his satisfaction, or that the conditions on which such camps or hospitals were sanctioned are not complied with. 6.  It will be seen that, following the analogy of the second clause * of rule 12 of Regulation No. 4 of the 10th February 1897,   which was based upon a suggestion made by a native   gentleman  to   the Presi- dent of the Medical Board, the   system of   caste   and class hospitals, which has  worked successfully in Bombay, has  been extended under certain conditions to joint families or associations of  families.    This concession will render it possible for the upper classes of the native community to secure for themselves and their families complete privacy in the event of their being attacked by plague,   and being required, in the interests of the general public, to submit  themselves to   segre- gation; while at the same   time it will enable the Plague Commission (Medical Board) to see that the  privilege is not abused, and to limit the privilege to the classes referred to in the second clause of para- graph   5 of your letter of the 30th   June.    The  Lieutenant-Governor hopes that it  will be possible to   induce persons   intending  to  take advantage of clause (2) to come forward in time and communicate with the Plague Commission.    When plague actually breaks out it will be too  late to   make any but  the simplest arrangements,   and persons who   have  not organised  their private hospitals beforehand will find themselves compelled  to   resort to  those  provided   for the  general public. 7.  In other respects the draft  regulation is  based  for the   most part upon  the   corresponding   rules in   force in   the   North-Western Provinces,  which  have  been modified   so  as to   adapt them to  the administrative  arrangements  of Bengal.     The   only    points  which seem to require special notice are the following:- (1) Bengal Plague Notification No. 1 of the 10th February 1897 has been cancelled as being ultra vires in that it delegat- ed to the Medical Board powers which can only be exercised by Government. The opportunity has also been * "Provided that when the Medical Board is satisfied that suitable and sufficient accommodation for the complete segregation of infected and suspected persons and efficient medical attendance have been provided by an association of families, it may exempt such families from the provisions of this regulation. This exemption may be withdrawn if the Health Officer reports that medical attendance and segregation are not maintained to his satisfaction."

(2) Provision has been made in rules 4 to 14 and 25 to 28 for the subsidiary precautions referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter of the 14th October 1897. These rules have been drawn up in consultation with the Inspector- General of Police, and aim at combining the system hitherto in force in Bengal with that which has been adopted in the North-Western Provinces and Central Provinces. A double check will thus be exercised over the movements of travellers from infected areas, and to this the Lieutenant-Governor proposes to add the further precaution of inspection by an itinerant staff of railway police whose business will be to test the observance of the rules by occasional inspections. The arrangements now proposed appear to the Lieutenant-Governor to be very complete, and if supplemented (as recommended in my telegram of the 30th October ) by the device of issuing specially coloured tickets to persons travelling by rail from infected areas, will enable the medical officers in charge of the principal inspection stations at Khana, Katihar, and Khurda to pass many persons whom they might otherwise be inclined to suspect of having broken a journey which commenced in an infected area with the object of evading inspection. The annoyance of unnecessary examination and possible detention will thus be reduced, and the medical officers will be enabled to give more time to the examination of travellers from infected areas. (3) Rules 23 and 24 and 33 to 38 confer upon the Magistrate of the district and, in Calcutta, upon the Chairman of the Corporation extensive powers in respect of appointing Health Officers and their subordinates, cleansing houses and premises, abating overcrowding, providing hospitals, etc. Recent experience has shown that Municipal Com- missioners in Bengal cannot be trusted to take timely or vigorous action in respect of these matters. As the Government of India are aware, it was only by the strong- est pressure that the Commissioners of Calcutta were induced to sanction an adequate establishment for the removal of the large accumulations of filth brought to

VII. notice by the enquiries of the Medical Board; and at the present time, if plague were to appear in Calcutta, it would find the town without a Health Officer capable of dealing with such an emergency. The case of the adjacent municipalities is even worse. The Lieutenant-Governor has now before him a strong representation from the Chamber of Commerce on the subject of the insanitary condition of Serampore; and in most of the smaller municipalities near Calcutta on either bank of the Hooghly the state of things is equally bad. The only remedy is to appoint a Health Officer with a sufficient staff to put matters right; but the income of the munici- palities is small; they could not afford to pay separate Health Officers, and jealousy and party spirit are too strong among them for there to be any chance of their agreeing to combine to pay a Health Officer. In view of the danger to Calcutta arising from these insanitary areas, the Lieutenant Governor is satisfied that the time has come for Government to intervene and to empower the Magistrates of Howrah, Hooghly, and the 24-Parganas to take such measure as are necessary to enforce reforms. They will be instructed to proceed with due regard to considerations of economy; but however careful they may be, the Lieutenant- Governor apprehends that it will be necessary to supplement the resources of the municipalities by borrowing under the Emergency Loans Act. His Honour trusts that the Government of India will be able to find the requisite funds in the event of the Provincial Loans Budget being exhausted. 8. As regards paragraph 6 of your letter of the 14th October, I am to say that the wording of paragraph 4 of Mr. Oldham's letter No. 8o6-T. M., of the 21st September 1897, seems to have given rise to some misapprehension. The intention of that paragraph was to inquire whether the inspections in other provinces were conducted on the same lines as that carried on at Khana. At Khana it has at no time been the practice to detain all passengers coming from infected areas. Detention under observation has been confined to persons who were regarded as suspicious by reason of their appearance, or symptoms, or the dirty condition of their clothes or effects. It has extended occasionally to persons who could not be easily traced and who could not be relied upon to give notice of the occurrence of plague among them, and to emigrants and persons of the coolie class travelling in large bodies. Since the publication of
APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 15 the Venice Conference, most of the persons detained at Khana on the grounds detailed above have been kept under observation for a period of ten days reckoned from the date on which they started from an infected area. Inquiry was accordingly made in paragraph 4 of Mr. Oldham's letter, whether this precaution was enforced in other provinces. It was stated, however, in somewhat too general terms, and should have referred to " all suspected travellers," and not to all travellers without exception or qualification. g. I am to request that if the Government of India approve of the draft rule relating to segregation, and of the general policy on which the remaining rules are explained in this letter, permission to publish the entire regulation may be communicated by telegram. I am to add that if necessity should arise the Lieutenant-Governor will issue them without waiting for the orders of the Government of India. Hardwar. No. 4.

Gwalior, the 8th May 1897. The orders received. I. Under instructions from H. H. the Maharajah Scindia I left Gwalior on the 17th of March and proceeded to Khandraoni village, arriving there on the 18th, to enquire into a reported outbreak of bubonic plague. Description of Khandraoni village. 2. Khandraoni is a village situated in the Karera Tehsil of the Chanderi Subah, distant from Jhansi, Dattia, Dinara, and Karera, twenty, ten, seven and twelve miles, respectively. 3. The population according to the last yearly census taken in July 1896 was 558 (187 men, 157 women, and 214 children), of which only five were Mahomedans, the remainder being Hindus, principally Brahmins. 4. The total area of the village lands is 2,599 bighas, 3 biswas. The area under cultivation in the current year is 940 bighas, the c 3
?18 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. [ APP. VII. average cultivated area in normal years being 1,006 bighas, and the revenue demand for the whole year being Rs. 1,374-1-0, Imperial coin. 5. On the north and west the village boundary runs with that of the villages of Rao Mou and Ata of the Dattia State, while to the south and east lie the Gwalior villages of Panoha and Belloni. 6. On my arrival, on the 18th of March, I examined all the sick in the village, and the signs and symptoms present, together with the epidemic nature of the outbreak and its history, left no doubt as to the disease being bubonic plague. History of the outbreak. 7. From enquiries made from the Patwari and Lambardar of the village, it appears that, for some years past, several of the inhabi- tants of Khandraoni have been in the habit of going to Bombay and taking service there, re-visiting their village at intervals; and that amongst these were two Brahmins, Bindraban and Khoobi, the former being one of the Lambardars of the villages. 8. These men came straight from Bombay to Khandraoni, arriving there on the 9th of January last (three days before Makar Sankrant in the month of Poos). On leaving Bombay Bindraban was suffering from fever and Khoobi attended him while on the way, bringing him to Jhansi by rail, and from there, in a country cart, to Khandraoni, where he died five days after his arrival. Two days after Bindra- ban's death Khoobi fell ill and died in three days, and about a week after his death a native hakim of the village, named Nazar Mahomed, who had been treating Bindraban and Khoobi, was attacked with fever and died; and at the same time another native hakim, named Gopi, who had come from Karera to treat Nazar Mahomed, also succumbed to the disease. The plague then gradually spread amongst the inhabitants of the village, and up to the date of my arrival there had been 59 seizures, of which 47 had proved fatal. Instructions received from H. H.the Maharajah. 9. His Highness the Maharajah Scindia's instructions were that in the event of the plague being present every means should be employed- (1) to stamp out the disease in the village itself; (2) to prevent its spread to any other part of the State; (3) to treat the sick; and (4) to interfere as little as possible with the harvesting of the crops then in the ground. The principles on Which the 10. Being satisfied that the disease was bubonic plague, the following principles were accepted as a basis on which measures
?APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 19 measures taken were based. should be taken to carry out the above instructions to a successful conclusion :- (a) That the plague was due to a specific microbe. (b) That this microbe could be carried by the excreta of persons suffering from plague and by clothing, wooden and earthen articles of all descriptions and by food of all kinds, cooked or uncooked. (c) That the microbe once imported by any of the above agencies into a house, where conditions obtained which were favourable to its development, not alone established it- self in the floor, walls and roof of that house, but also in or on every article which that house contained. (d) That the conditions favourable to the development of the microbe were insanitary conditions of all kinds, especial- ly dirt, overcrowding and the absence of thorough ventilation and light. (e) That the microbe could not establish itself unless the above conditions were present, and that it was impossible for it to exist for more than a few days in any place which was free from insanitary conditions and exposed to the direct rays of the sun, and that very high artificial heat rendered it inert. Measures taken. 11. For the purpose of clearness in this report the following  measures based on the above principles are recorded, not in the sequence of their being given effect to, but in regard to the objects held in view, many of the measures being carried out simultaneously :- (a) An order was sent to the Officer Commanding the Karera Cantonment to march at once to Khandraoni with four companies of infantry and hospital establishment and equipment. The Tehsildar of Karera was also ordered to come to Khandraoni and arrange for such supplies as might be necessary for the troops and villagers. (b) In the meantime a nominal roll was made of all the inhabi- tants of the village, and it was found that the total num- ber present was 435. (c) These were each examined and were divided for the purposes of segregation into four classes, viz. :- Class I.-Those families who were perfectly healthy and amongst whom no case of plague or fever of any kind had occurred since the 9th of January (it was thought advisable to treat any case of fever as coming under the head of plague, as it was impossible from questioning the villagers

Class II.-Those families who were in good health, but amongst whom cases of plague and fever had occurred since 9th of January. Class III.-Those families amongst whom there were cases con- valescent from plague or fever. Class IV.-Those families, some of whose members were then suffering with plague or fever. Evacuation of village. 12. On the 19th of March four companies of the 6th Infantry having arrived from Karera, the inhabitants were ordered to go to their houses and remain there. Sentries were then posted on all the infected houses (i.e., of classes II, III and IV) as well as those of class I in their immediate vicinity, and strict orders were issued to prevent any persons entering or leaving those houses or taking any article therefrom. 13. The remainder of the inhabitants (i.e., class I, with the exception of those mentioned in paragraph 12) were then turned out of the village and surrounded by a cordon of sentries. This portion of the population were allowed to take any of their property which they wanted with them. 14. Classes II, III and IV as well as those of class I living in their immediate vicinity were then successively taken out of the village and segregated one from another by a cordon of sentries, those of class I hitherto detained being allowed to join the others of the same class. 15. These classes and those of class I above referred to were not allowed to take anything out of their houses, except the clothes they were wearing, as much bedding as was absolutely necessary for their protection from the climate, their money, ornaments and metal cook- ing utensils. 16. In carrying out this measure I took the precaution of visiting each house in turn, and saw that each family were placed in charge of an escort and conducted straight to the place appointed for their segregation, and that the order regarding the removal of any article other than those above mentioned was strictly adhered to. 17. The village having been evacuated, sentries were posted all round with strict orders to prevent any one from entering the village. Arrangenents for focd-3upply. 18. The following were the arrangements for feeding classes II, III and IV:- (a) Two Bunniahs were engaged from a neighbouring village, where it was ascertained that no plague was present, and
APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 21 the necessary supplies were also brought from the same source. (b) Both Bunniahs and supplies were placed under a guard, orders being given not to allow any of the villagers to come in contact with them, nor to allow the latter to mix with the inhabitants of the village. (c) The amount of grain, etc., necessary for each individual family was calculated and supplied once a day under the following arrangements. (d) The daily supplies were taken by a Bunniah under escort to the boundary of the segregation camp, where one member of each family was deputed to receive them. The supplies were then weighed and handed over, care being taken that neither the Bunniah nor his scales came in contact with the segregated inhabitants, the Bunniah was then marched back to the place allotted for supplies and again placed under the Commissariat Guard. Arrangements for hutting, et: 19. Arrangements were also made for the supply of chapper huts, charpoys, straw and blankets for hospital, and for the old and weakly portion of the community, while grinding stones for the por- tion of class I who were not allowed to bring these articles from the village were also supplied as well as new earthen vessels to all who required them. It may here be mentioned that there was little or no grain brought out of the villages, as those who were allowed to bring any had little or none to bring and were beginning to live on the current year's produce, some of which was then on the threshing-floors. Water-supply. 20. As the segregation camps were all situated along the banks of a small river which was the usual source of water-supply, no diffi- culty regarding this was experienced, but care was taken that the segregation camp of the healthy portion of the inhabitants was highest up stream, while that of the hospital was lowest. Compensation lists. 21. The owners of the infected houses as well as of those of the houses in their immediate vicinity were called upon to give lists of  property therein with a view to subsequent compensation; these were made out in my presence by the Patwari, and having been initialled by me, were handed over to the owners. The majority of the lists contained property of little value, but in two or three instances where the amount of grain, goor and ghee, etc., seems suspiciously large, the owner was taken to his house and made to show where the amount which he had written down was, and it was invariably found that only about half the stated amount was present. The necessary correction was made in the list and owner was again marched back to segregation camp under escort.
?22 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency, [APP. VII. Infected houses burnt. 22. With the help of a few policemen and chuprassies hay and other inflammable materials were then placed in the infected houses and those in their immediate vicinity, which were then set fire to and destroyed under my personal supervision; care being taken that nothing that could be burnt escaped. A short time after the houses were set fire to it began to blow half a gale, and a good many more houses than was intended were destroyed by fire, but this may be looked upon as an error of Providence, if such can be, on the right side. Every heap of refuse and litter in and round the village was also set fire to and burned as far as this was possible. The sentries placed over the infected houses were then withdrawn, the cordon round the village still remaining. 23. Every morning and evening a bugler blew "The assembly" for roll call and inspection in the several camps, any one showing signs of disease or debility being put apart for further examination after inspection. 24. It having been found that some of the people obtained their livelihood by daily labour and begging, these had to be put on free rations at the expense of the State, their ordinary means of livelihood being interfered with by their segregation in camp. Every effort was made to convince the people that the measures taken were entirely for their own benefit and with a view to stop the mortality amongst them. Compensation was promised for the unavoidable damage to their property and crops; they were made as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. Small luxuries, such as tobacco, etc., was given to them, they were urged and encouraged to scatter themselves as much as possible, to wash themselves and their clothing, and to keep the ground in their vicinity clean. It was, moreover, pointed out that it was absolutely necessary that the camp rules should be carried out in their entirety for the purpose of obtaining the full bene- fit for which they were formulated, and they were made to understand very clearly that, if necessary, these rules would be carried out by force. 25. The sentries were prohibited from entering the segregation camp, and were warned not to let any of the villagers approach within fifteen yards of their post. Measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. 26. The measures taken to prevent the plague from spreading to other parts of the State were as follows: - (a) The whole of the staff of civil officials, Suba, Tehsildar, chuprassies, etc., were removed from the vicinity of the village and located nearthe village Belloni, nobody, except the medical staff and the officers and sepoys engaged on
?APP. VII.] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 23 segregation duty, being allowed to remain within the boundary limits of Khandraoni village. (b) Nobody, without regard to his rank, business or occupation, was permitted to enter or leave the segregation camps or cross the village boundary without an order from me and without being accompanied by one of the orderly Havil- dars detailed for this duty at my camp, and orders were issued to the sentries that under no pretext whatsoever was this rule to be broken, and to make this further cer- tain, entrance to or exit from village boundary limits on segregation camps was absolutely prohibited, except at one place appointed for this purpose. Considerable incon- venience no doubt arose from this rule, but it was early recognised that the strict observance of this rule was of the most vital importance, and it is satisfactory to be able to state that, with one exception which fortunately was followed by no ill-result, but of which due notice was taken, no instance of this rule being broken came to my knowledge, and that the Officers Commanding the Troops, Sir-Suba, and other officials set a good example by their strict adherence to this rule. (c) A list containing the names of every village within a radius of ten miles from Khandraoni was made out, these villages were divided into circles of four or five villages, each according to the distance between them, and each circle was placed in charge of a policeman whose duty it was to collect daily reports from the Patwaris of each village. The reports to contain the following in- formation:- I.-Whether there were any sick in the village, and if so, the nature of their sickness. II.-Whether any one had arrived or left the village since last report, and if so, where they had come from or gone to. (d) On comparing the census of Khandraoni, taken in July 1896, with the number of people present when the roll was made out, it was seen that there was a considerable decrease in the population, even allowing for the number who had died of plague and other cause during the preceding eight months. A return was therefore called for from all villages within ten miles radius showing, if any one from Khandraoni had arrived in the village since the beginning of January, and if so, whether they were
24 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. [ APP. VII, still there, a list of their names with dates of arrival being also asked for, enquiry was also made from the inhabi- tants of Khandraoni itself as to the whereabouts of any one who had left the village since the arrival of the Brahmins, Bindraban and Khoobi, from Bombay. (e) Orders were issued that if there were any persons who had come from Bombay since July 1896, or from Khandraoni since the 1st of January 1897, such persons were to be segregated outside the village until inspected by the medical officer. (f) A list was called for giving the names of any of the inhabi- tants of villages who might then be in Bombay, and orders were issued that their relations in the village should write and tell them that they were prohibited from coming back to the State during the continuance of the plague at Bombay. (g) Orders were issued to the inhabitants of all villages within ten miles round that no person from Khandraoni or Bombay was to be admitted into the village; moreover, they them- selves were prohibited from coming to Khandraoni, and they were also told that, except for any very urgent reasons, they were to remain at their own village for at least a month. (h) The villages all round were inspected, those in which there were people who had come from Khandraoni and Bombay being taken first, and no case of plague was found to be present amongst them. False alarms were at first of fre- quent occurrence, as the daily reports contained many cases, whose symptoms, roughly described by the Pat- waris, might be those of plague; these were inspected without delay, and though doing so entailed many long rides, still there was satisfactory compensation, inasmuch as none of these cases thus inspected proved to be plague. (i) Supplies for the sepoys were brought from outside into their camp, which was pitched about a mile from the villages under escort. The carts were unloaded, and the cart and cartmen at once conducted outside village limits. The supplies for segregation camp were in a similar manner brought to the places appointed for the Bunniahs near which no villager was allowed to approach.
?APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 25 Arrangements for treatment of sick. 27. The arrangements for the treatment of the sick were as follows:- (a) The Hospital Assistant and medicines were ordered with the troops from Karera. (b) Chapper huts were provided for each patient, the huts being placed about 20 yards from one another, clean straw being placed on the ground, separate chappers were made for the other members of the patient's family who were allowed to attend upon their own sick, but were discour- aged from coming in any number to the sick huts. (c) Charpoys with blankets, etc., were supplied, suitable food was cooked for all patients either by a member of their own family or by a Brahman who was appointed as a cook or water-carrier. 28. There being few patients in hospital, nobody, except the Medical Officer, Assistant Medical Officer and Hospital Assistant, were allowed to enter the segregation camps. 29. A mehtar was entertained for the hospital segregation camp, and was not allowed to go outside it until it was finally broken up. 30. When a patient died the body was cremated, all the patient's clothes, charpoy, hut, etc., being burnt, compensation for clothes being paid to the relatives. 31. The mode of supplying the hospital camp with food has already been noted. Non-inter- ference with harvest. 32. There was at first considerable difficulty in carrying out the: instruction issued regarding non-interference with the harvesting of the crops, as on the arrival of the four companies of infantry from Karera it was found that the total strength amounted to only 204 sepoys, and it was impossible to cover the amount of ground within village limits with the number of sentries at my disposal. I therefore telegraphed to Gwalior to send four more companies of infantry from Lashkar, and in the meantime I had perforce to keep the inhabitants in segregration camp of a necessarily confined area; H. H. the Maharajah's promptness in acceding to my request and in despatch- ing without delay four companies of the 10th Infantry of a strength of 232 sepoys placed me in a position to carry out H. H.'s instruc- tions regarding the crops. 33. The line of sentries round the segregation camp were thrown back to the limits of the village boundary, and the people of class I were then at liberty to harvest their crops at their leisure, with the exception of those lying within segregation camps of classes II, III and IV; and after ten days in segregation camp, those of class II, no case of plague having occurred amongst them, were also allowed to C4
?26 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. [ APP. VII. harvest their crops and were amalgamated with class I in so far as the limit of their camp was concerned. 34. The crops of classes III and IV were harvested under the direction of the Assistant Tehsildar attached to the Suba's camp. 35. The villagers of Billoni who had a few fields just inside the Khandraoni village limits were allowed to work under a guard; they cut their crops in one day and took them outside the chain of sentries, not having come in contact with the Khandraoni villagers in any way. 36. It was thought well to defer cleaning up the village until the infected houses, as well as the sanitary site, had been exposed to the disinfecting action of the sun and air for at least three weeks, and thus prevent the danger of persons engaged in cleaning the village from contracting the disease. Cleaning and disinfecting village. 37. The following were the arrangements made for cleaning and disinfecting the village:- (a) A number was affixed to every house in the village and a list of the owners was made, the houses being divided into classes to correspond with those into which the inhabitants had been divided in the first instance, except that class II was amalgamated with class I. (b) The owners of class I were then required to clean their own houses, and, for this purpose, were divided into working parties of not more than ten persons in each, each working party being supplied with phowras, baskets, etc., to clean away dirt and rubbish, and lime for the purpose of white- washing the houses inside and outside, and were placed in charge of two sepoys who were ordered to see that this work was thoroughly and quickly carried out, and that all rub- bish was removed to a distance and burnt as far as possible, that the working parties did not enter houses other than their own, and that every evening they marched them out- side the chain of sentries posted round the village, and saw that the phowras, baskets, etc., were deposited in the place assigned to them under a guard. Rest from noon to 2 o'clock was allowed, and the work was daily inspected in order to see that it was properly done. (c) As the people of classes III and IV were still segregated from the rest of the population and remained so until the camp was finally broken up, working parties were engaged to clean their houses from which the dbris was first removed, the floors were then dug up to the depth of one and a half feet, the walls were scraped, and both were
APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 27 thoroughly sprayed with disinfectants by means of a fire- engine, worked by hand, brought from Gwalior for this purpose. (d) In the meantime the working parties were engaged in clean- ing up the village generally, every one employed being paid daily, and the working parties being all under the supervision of sepoys told off for this purpose; no slouching was allowed, and the work was carried out sys- tematically and continuously until I was satisfied that the village was cleaned as far as any Indian village could be. Segregation camp broken up. The village having been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and no case of plague having occurred since the 1st April, and those who had been under treatment being now recovered, the segregation camp was broken up on the 29th April. But before this was done every man, woman, and child in the hospital segregation camp, was obliged to bathe and to exchange the clothes they were wearing for new ones, which were supplied free. 38. The hospital huts, patients' clothes, blankets, charpoys and all other articles of a combustible nature were burnt, the only things brought out of the hospital segregation camp by its occupants being money, jewellery, metal cooking utensils and the new clothes given to them. Arrangements were made for a Hospital Assistant with medicines to remain at the village for one month from the breaking up of the camp, and he was directed to hold periodical inspections and to report the result. The harvest having been gathered, and there being many in the village who obtained their livelihood by daily labour or begging, relief works were started for the former, and free rations were continued to those of the latter who were unable to work. A project is being prepared for a " Bund" in the vicinity of the village, and the making of this will not only give work to the inhabitants for some months to come, but will also enlarge the area of cultivation and form an increased source of revenue to the State. General remarks. 39. The effects of the measures taken were too successful to allow  of any extended study of the disease, as besides the eleven cases  admitted on my arrival at the village, only four more admissions took place, and those within ten days from the information of the segrega- tion camps. Of the total, 15 cases treated, 4 died, i.e., 26.6 per cent. of admissions, while the mortality before the segregation camp was formed was 79.6 per cent. of seizures. The symptoms and the signs of the disease did not differ from those which have been observed during the present epidemic in Bombay, a fatal termination being preceded by pneumonic symptoms and great prostration, while in
?28 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. [ APP. VII. all the cases that recovered general debility was very marked feature. In one or two instances the wounds caused by opening the bubos, healed very slowly, and in one patient, who was convalescent for some time and quite free from fever, a small swelling appeared on the forearm, unaccompanied with pain or inflammation, but over which distinct fluctuation was present, it soon, however, disappeared by resolution. In another case the only sign present was a bubo in the groin, no fever or constitutional disturbance of any kind being pre- sent, and the patient was otherwise healthy and well nourished; this I would classify as "Pestis ambulans" (even at the risk of being considered Irish), the patient being a child of four months old. With regard to the statement that, though rats are very susceptible to plague, their enemy, cats, are immune, it may be interesting to note that a dead cat was found in one of the infected houses, but the fact that it died of plague was not verified by microscopical examination. Compensation payable to the villagers. 40. The loss for which the villagers have to be compensated is classified as follows:- I.-Damage done to rabi crops. II.-Re-roofing the infected houses which were burnt down. III.-Loss of property which was burnt in the houses. 41. In order to explain fully the process of calculating compensa- tion and to make the figures clear, the different classes of compensa- tion above enumerated are separately dealt with and classified state- ments of same are appended to this report. Damage to Rabi crop. 42. The area cultivated with rabi was 250 9/20 bighas, composed of 290 fields of 101 cultivators, out of which 1243/20 bighas were held by the zamindars of the village as their Khud Kasht, and 1266/20 bighas were cultivated by tenants on cash or grain rent. 43. The crop was generally barley and masur, mixed. gram and wheat being sown in a few fields. Nearly two-thirds of area sown with rabi crops were irrigated, the remaining one-third being unirri- gated: and on this, as the soil is mostly pondwa and inferior kanker, the crop was naturally bad, but on the irrigated portion an average outturn of five maunds per bigha was estimated. 44. When the plague segregation camp was formed the crops were ripe and had been partly cut and removed to the threshing-floors, the remainder of the crops then in the ground being afterwards cut by the owners who had access to their fields, those crops belonging to people in hospital segregation camp being cut through the agency of labours employed by the State for this purpose. 45. In this way the damage done to the standing crops was not great, and was due altogether to the cattle straying into the fields.
?APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 29 This damage occurred owing to the small strength of the troops available for sentry duty when the camp was first formed, rendering it impossible to allow the villagers access to their fields and so prevent damage from cattle; neither was it possible, for sanitry reasons, to keep the cattle within segregation camp, as they numbered 1,500, nor could arrangements be made for their food. This state of things, however, only lasted for a couple of days, until the arrival of the four companies of infantry from Lashkar. 46. There were some instances, which will be enumerated here- after, in which the people were not allowed to cut their crops at all, and they were completely damaged, compensation in full being allowed. 47. As all the crops had been cut before the compensation list was made out, and therefore the damage done could not be estimated from an inspection of the standing crops, the following course was taken to estimate the loss incurred. The average outturn of the village was found by selecting seven khalians of different kinds of grain and belonging to different known fields both irrigated and un- irrigated, and having them threshed, cleaned and weighed; from this an estimate was formed of the produce of each field. Enquiry was then made as to the average outturn of five adjoining villages having similar advantages and similar soil as Khandraoni, and also the average outturn of the perganna, and comparing the existing produce of the Khandraoni fields, with the average outturn of the adjoining villages and of the whole of the perganna, an estimate was formed of the loss of grain in each field and its equivalent in rupees was cal- culated at the market rate obtaining in the village. 48. The instances in which the crops were completely damaged, and in which it is proposed to give compensation for the full value of the crop according to the average outturn of the village, are as fol- lows:- (a) Nos. 5 and 6, area 11/20 - bighas, cultivated by Murli Dhar, Brahmin, who was not allowed to cut his crops, because the fields were situated inside the hospital segregation camp, where he had no admission. (b) Barley store of Madho Singh, son of Bhansi, the produce of No. 265/1 and 514, area 216/20bighas which was burnt as infect- ed grain. (c) Mohwa crop of Dhalip Singh, Lambardar, who, being in hospital, was not allowed to gather it. 49. The yearly revenue demand on the village is Rs. 1,374-1-0, out of which the zamindars have only paid a four-anna instalment
?30 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency, [ APP. VII. before the plague outbreak, and the remainder Rs. 1,039-15-0 is in arrears ; and in order to relieve, as far as possible, the zamindars from the revenue demand, it is proposed to deduct the uncollected rents of tenants' lands from the compensation payable to them for the damage done to their crops, and to credit it to the revenue due from the zamindars ; having done this, so much of the compensation payable to the zamindars for their Khud Kasht sufficient to satisfy in full the ratable revenue demand of each individual co-sharer, according to the figures obtained from the Patwari, is also credited ; or where a full adjustment of the revenue demand was impossible, on account of the compensation falling short of the revenue demand,. the whole of the compensation payable was taken in part payment. In this way Rs. 768-2-0, Imperial coin, can be realized out of the revenue demand payable to the State without any burden on the pockets of the zamindars, who, in addition to being considerably relieved of the revenue demand, have the advantage of appropriating all existing grain and getting the surplus compensation. 50. The arrears of revenue then remaining uncollected would be Rs. 271-13-0, Imperial coin, due from the co-sharers who had no Khud Kasht of rabi, or whose compensation for Khud Kasht fell short of the revenue demand ; and having regard to the disastrous effects of the plague outbreak, it is recommended that this amount should be allowed to stand over for two years, after which it could be collected by easy instalments. 51. The classified statement A, appended to this report, shows the value of the loss in the average outturn of the crops of each man, the amount of revenue realized from him, and the compensation pay- able, if any, after deducting the revenue demand. A summary of this statement is as follows :-  Rs.  A.  P. Value of crops in Raja Shahi coin 1,100 9 9 Deduct revenue in do. 834  11  9 Compensation to be paid under this head after    deducting revenue 265  14  0 52. Statement B, appended to this report, shows the distribution of the arrears of revenue over the four Pattas into which the village lands are divided, and the account within the Pattas will be made by the Patwari afterwards, having regard to the arrears which were originally due from each of the co-sharers and to the amount realized out of the compensation of his Khud Kasht and his tenants' lands by the method here proposed.
APP. VII. ] Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. 31 Compensation for houses. 53. This class of compensation refers only to persons whose houses being infected, or contagious to those infected, were burnt. 54. In order to make an estimate of the cost of re-roofing the houses, measurements of each roof were taken, and the amount of wood required for this purpose and also for doors, etc., was noted; an estimate was then made of the different kinds of materials required for each roof, and the cost of re-roofing calculated at the local rate, and adding to this the value of the doors and the cost of labour, the amount of compensation payable for each house separately was obtained. Most of the houses had tile roofing, the average cost of which at the village rate is Re, 0-1-7 per square yard, thatched roofing costing half as much more. Some of the houses had masonry roofs;  the cost of these has been calculated separately at local rates. State- ment C, appended to this report, shows detail of materials required and the compensation payable for each house. Compensation for loss oE property burnt in the hous- es. 55. Compensation under this head is payable only to those whose  houses were burnt. Lists of property in those houses which were to  be burnt were made out beforehand, but it was difficult to calculate  the compensation due to those villagers whose houses were acci- dently burnt on account of the gale which sprung up after the infected houses were set fire to; but as, before any of the houses were burnt, the people were given every opportunity of removing their cash and gold and silver ornaments and metal utensils, and most of those were removed by them or were made over to them from time to time as they were found in their houses, the only articles which were destroyed consisted chiefly of food grains, gur, ghee and clothing. The list given to the villagers in the first instance was called for, and all articles which had been removed by, or handed over to, them were struck out of the lists, and compensation for the remaining articles was then calculated. The lists which were filed by the owners of those houses which were accidently burnt, after this had occurred, were carefully gone through. The recep- tacles in which they said their grain, etc., was stored were inspected, their capacity ascertained, and an estimate thus formed of the com- pensation due. 56. Tabular statement D shows the compensation payable under the different heads, and, at a glance, how much each man is to get for the total loss suffered by him. 57. The amount is calculated in Raja Shahi rupees, as that is the coin current in the village. Conclusion. I cannot close the report without expressing my thanks to the officials who were detailed for duty with me at Khandraoni. The ssistant Medical Officer, Dr. Wagle, L. R. C. P. and S., Edinburgh,
?32 Measures outside the Bombay Presidency. [ APP. VII. rendered me invaluable assistance and spared neither time nor trouble in carrying out the duties entrusted to him. The Sir-Suba of Esagarh made excellent arrangements for supplies, etc., for the camp, until he was obliged to leave by sickness brought on by the extreme heat, after which his work was well carried out by Suba Sahib of Chanderi. I cannot too highly praise the work of Moonshi Jugal- kishore to whom the cleaning up the village was for the most part entrusted, as well as that of estimating the amount of compensation payable to the villagers for property destroyed and crops damaged. His report* is incorporated in this, and having gone over the figures, I am quite satisfied that his estimates are correct and equitable in every respect. The conduct of the troops (4 companies of the 6th and 4 com- panies of 10th Infantry) engaged on segregation duty was all that could be desired, and their strict obedience to orders contributed in no small degree to the result obtained, my thanks being especially due to Captain Eseri Singh, Commanding the 10th Infantry. Inspector of Police, Gayapershad, performed his duties to my entire satisfaction, Patwari Thakoorparshad of Khandraoni. Police Sepoy Ismail of Jigni. Do. late Mohamed of Karera. and the subordinate officials mentioned in margin also worked well. I trust the Darbar will recognize the work done by the above officials, the due performance of which, to- gether with the very full authority given to me by H. H. the Maharajah, enabled me to carry out H. H.'s instructions to what, I trust, will be considered a successful conclusion. * Not printed.

?APPENDIX VIII. MEASURES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION BY LAND. Correspondence regarding Land Quarantine. No. I. No. 276, dated Calcutta, the 13th February 1897. From -W. BANKS GWYTHER, Esq., Secretary to the Medical Board, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal Department. I am directed by the Medical Board to say that the following tele- gram has to-day been received from Bombay:- "Your yesterday telegram. Persons determined on pilgrimage will proceed Nassick Quarantine Camp, remain probably ten days, all others allowed going homes. Bengalis sent Howrah, Calcutta Police daily advised." It appears from this telegram that only those pilgrims who state they are determined to go on pilgrimage are detained under observa- tion at Nassick; while those who say that they wish to return to their homes are allowed to do so. In practice this obviously means that pilgrims who say they are not going to Mecca are able to go wherever they choose and may therefore spread infection indefinitely. In view of the great danger which the arrangements of the Bombay Govern- ment involve and the strong public feeling on the subject in Calcutta, the Board desire to urge very strongly that not only pilgrims but all persons leaving Bombay, Karachi or other infected places should be detained for 10 days under observation whatever statements they may make as to their intentions. We are aware that this proposal is a drastic one, but we submit that it is justified by the fact that Calcutta is now the only outlet for the trade of Northern India. No. 2. No. 1065-Medical, dated Calcutta, the 25th February 1897. From-H. H. RISLEY, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal (Medical) Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to submit, for the consideration and orders of the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a Resolution adopted unanimously by the Medical Board, Calcutta, indicating certain
?36 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII, measures which might be taken with the object of restricting pas- senger traffic between areas in the Bombay Presidency infected with plague and Bengal. With reference to this resolution, I am to say that the Lieutenant-Governor sees great difficulty in enforcing such a system as that proposed, and, in the case of European passengers and their baggage, the precautions suggested are probably superfluous. It is, however, undoubtedly invidious to make race distinctions. At the same time there is no disputing the fact that infection may very easily be carried in the bundles and baggage of native passengers who may themselves satisfy the medical inspectors. The Lieutenant- Governor would be inclined himself to advocate the detention at con- venient stations, just outside infected areas, of all passengers there- from for a period of 24 hours in order to enable careful medical inspection to be made and baggage to be disinfected. Mail passengers from Europe should be run through from the Docks without stopping in Bombay. Resolution adopted by the Medical Board at a Meeting held on the 22nd February 1897. "We think there is a strong feeling in Calcutta that, if possible, some measures should be taken with the object of restricting passen- ger traffic between areas in the Bombay Presidency infected with plague and Bengal. In deference to this feeling we suggest that the Bombay Government should be asked to consider whether- (a) Either a land quarantine for all passengers should be estab- lished at a point or points as close as possible to the infected areas, (b) Or third class passenger traffic should be suspended over a certain section of the lines communicating with infected places, and (c) passengers' baggage should be disinfected at quarantine stations. In the event of (a) being accepted, special arrangements should be made for passengers in transit from Europe, and they and their baggage should be passed through the infected area without stop- ping." Telegram No. 779-A., dated Calcutta, the 28th February 1897. No. 3. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. Government of India are advised that considerable danger of infec- tion exists from clothes and bundles carried by third class passengers
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 37 from infected area. They could not issue a notification prescrib- ing disinfection of such property when belonging to third class pas- sengers only, but it would be possible perhaps to issue notification prescribing disinfection except when medical officer thinks fit to declare it unnecessary. Government of India are advised that effici- ent disinfection could be effected by apparatus capable of producing steam at temperature of 24 and that articles exposed to steam at this temperature could be sterilized in an hour or less. Failing such apparatus caldrons could be set up and clothing boiled in them for similar period, or caldrons could be used as subsidiary to steam apparatus. Government of India think that, if arrangements for dis- infection can be made, it would be desirable to arrange for it at Anand, Bhusawal, Dhond and Hyderabad, or somewhere in neighbourhood, but would be glad to receive as soon as possible advice of Govern- ment of Bombay as to whether effective measures can be taken for disinfection, and, if so, at what places. In case this is feasible, would Bombay Government recommend any special exemption, and, if so, of what nature for baggage of travellers from Europe who leave Bombay at once oh arrival of steamer? Madras Government have asked Government of India to prohibit importation by railway or road of articles, importation of which by sea is prohibited by Home Department Notification No. 513. Govern- ment of India would be glad to learn views of Bombay Government as to this. No. 4. Telegram No. 658-P., dated the 4th March 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Your secret telegram of the 28th February. Disinfecting cloth- ing and baggage would be useful accompaniment of quarantine in this Presidency or suspension of third class railway passengers traffic in neighbourhood of frontier, but unless Government of India consider these necessary usefulness of former incommensurate with difficulty. Luggage in bags, bundles of passengers, not perhaps more in need of disinfection than clothes worn, but difficulty in the way of stripping would be large. In absence of road and rail quarantine and close- ness of numerous railway stations near disinfecting stations proposed measures could be evaded by passengers alighting at previous stations and after land journey re-embarking at subsequent stations. Dis- infection stores not speedily obtainable. Boiling would involve subsequent classing and sorting clothes. Trains would be delayed for hours. In view of possibility of incubation for nine days, infection by personal intercourse cannot be avoided except by quarantine. It
?38 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. is admitted proposed measure would discourage passenger traffic and anything having this effect will lessen the danger of spreading the plague. Nevertheless this Government see so many practical difficulties specially large establishment, which may be more usefully engaged elsewhere, that they deprecate adoption of the proposed measure unless Government of India resolve for protection of rest of India, seeing that incubation is nine days, to impose quarantine against this Presidency. Again if disinfecting clothes were recognised as neces- sary this Government would have to adopt if not only at frontier stations but also at numerous other stations for its own protection, and the difficulty in the way of efficiently working on a large scale would be so great that it would perhaps be (going) more satisfactorily to temporarily suspend third class railway passenger traffic altogether in certain places. Again if disinfection of baggage transmitted by rail were necessary, need for similar action regarding baggage leaving Bombay by sea would be evident. Should proposed measure be adopted Railway stations at which trains are emptied for medical inspection would be selected. Telegram No. 934, dated Calcutta, the 12th March 1897. No. 5. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. Your telegram No. 658-P., dated 4th, regarding disinfection and suggestion for imposition of quarantine. Government of India have given careful consideration to views of Bombay Government. In their opinion there are overwhelming objections to land quaran- tine. All experience including that at Sukkur recently proves that land quarantine cannot be made effective. If ineffective on a small scale it would be far more so if attempt were made to quarantine the whole of Bombay Presidency. Land quarantine must besides being ineffective give opportunities for oppression and extortion and may give rise to serious outbreaks of disease at quarantine stations. Delegates of British Government at Venice Conference have been instructed to press for principles of Dresden Conference and apart from objections above stated it would be impolitic at present time to give opportunity to European powers to urge greater restrictions on Indian trade by abandoning principle that quarantine does no good. For these reasons Government of India are not prepared to sanction quarantine against Bombay Presidency. They also think that, in view of these considerations, Resolution of Bombay Government, No. 1136 over 632-P. of 3rd instant, empowering District Magistrates to impose quarantine should be re-considered. They think that by careful observation of all arrivals from infected to uninfected parts
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 39 and by measures for thoroughly cleansing towns better results will be secured than by imposing quarantine. Stoppage of third class pas- senger traffic would be open to objection, that it would make invidious distinction between classes, would cause great inconvenience and hardship, and would not be effective or prevent chance of contagion by any persons who might choose to take first or second class tickets. Upon question of disinfection Government of India think, after carefully considering Bombay Government's representation, that fumigation by sulphur should for present be used at stations of Bombay Presidency nearest to frontier where inspections are made, the medical officer being authorised to use solution of carbolic acid or corrosive sublimate in cases of articles which seem to him specially dirty or suspicious. No. 6. Telegram No. 276, dated Lahore, the 4th March 1897. From-The Junior Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Several cases of non-imported plague have appeared at Sukkur and one or two at Hyderabad, and we hear that the attempt to estab- lish quarantine at Sukkur has been abandoned. Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick thinks it should be seriously considered whether, to check advance of disease into Punjab, quarantine say of ten days should not be estab- lished at some place within southern position of Punjab. Cordons being thrown out at right angles to railway and river extending a good way west into Dera Ghazi Khan District and east into Bhawalpur to prevent people getting round and evading quarantine. Such cordons are being established to stop pilgrims from Sind going to Sakhi Sarwar, and His Honour believes they could be made fairly effective; he, however, hesitates to carry out this without sanction of Government of India as no general quarantine for all comers seems to have been established elsewhere yet. No. 7. Telegram No. 935, dated Calcutta, the 12th March 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of the Punjab. Your telegram No. 276 of 4th, communicating opinion of Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick that it should be seriously considered whether in order to check advance of plague into Punjab, quarantine should not be established at some place within southern portion of Punjab cordons being thrown out at right angles to railway and thence ex- tending into Dehra Ghazi Khan District on west and Bahawalpur on east. Government of India have given careful consideration to this pro- posal. It is clear that there is danger to Punjab from existence of
?40 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. indigenous cases of plague at Sukkur, and Government of India desire to give Punjab Government every possible assistance in keeping disease out of province. But there are in their opinion overwhelming objections to land quarantine. They observe that Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick did not expect more than that it would be fairly effective and all experience in- cluding that at Sukkur recently proves that land quarantine cannot be made effective while it must give opportunities for oppression and extor- tion and may give rise to serious outbreaks of disease at quarantine stations. At Dresden Conference of 1893, majority of European powers condemned and quarantines and policy of Secretary of State and British Government has continuously been opposed to quaratine. Delegates of British Government at Venice Conference have been instructed to press for principles of Dresden Conference and apart from objections above stated it would be impolitic at present time to give opportunity to European powers to urge greater restrictions on Indian trade by abandoning principle that quarantine does no good. For these reasons Government of India are reluctantly compelled to refuse assent to establishment of land quarantine in Punjab against Sind. They think that widest discretion should be given to inspecting Medical Officer at Khanpur to stop any person who is at all suspicious whether by reason of his symptoms, appearance or dirty condition of his clothes or effects. The Lieutenant-Governor may also find it desirable to appoint other inspecting officers to inspect passengers proceeding by road or river and similar discretion should be given to any officers so appointed. By these measures and by making ar- rangements similar to those enjoined in Part I of North-Western Pro- vinces Notification of 12th February last under Epidemic Diseases Act and by simultaneously carrying out thorough clearing of towns in Punjab, Government of India hope that it will be possible to prevent disease entering Punjab. No. 996, dated Calcutta, the 17th March 1897. No. 8. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Financial Department. I am directed to state, for the information of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, that the Government of India have recently taken into their careful consideration, in connection with certain suggestions made by the Governments of Bombay and the Punjab, the expediency of enforcing a system of land quarantine against the plague infected areas. The Government of Bombay suggested that the Government of India might endeavour to protect the rest of India by imposing quarantine against the Bombay Presidency or by tempo- rarily suspending third class railway traffic altogether in certain places.
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 41 The Government of the Punjab suggested that quarantine should be established against Sind at some place within the southern portion of the Punjab, cordons being thrown out for a considerable distance at right angles to the railway and river. 2. After carefully considering these suggestions, the Government of India have decided that there are overwhelming objections to the imposition of land quarantine. All experience, including that of the recent attempt made by the Government of Bombay at Sukkur, proves that land quarantine cannot be made effective even on a small scale. It would be hopeless to endeavour to put in quarantine the whole of the Bombay Presidency or the large tracts which are infected with plague. The attempt to enforce land quarantine regulations would, besides being ineffective, give opportunities for oppression and extor- tion and might give rise to serious outbreaks of the disease at the quarantine stations. 3. The imposition of land quarantine is also opposed to the princi- ples which Her Majesty's Government and the Government of India have been continuously urging in respect of quarantine generally and which were accepted by the Sanitary Conference held at Dresden in 1893 so far as land quarantine goes. The delegates of Her Majesty's Government at the Conference now being held at Venice have been instructed to press for the recog- nition of the principles of the Dresden Conference. Apart then from the inherent objections to the adoption of land quarantine it would, even were it possible to hope that it might help to prevent the com- munication of plague from an infected to an uninfected area, be impolitic at the present time to give opportunity to the European Powers to urge for further restrictions against Indian trade on the ground that the Government of India had abandoned the principle of the inefficiency of quarantine. 4. The Government of India also consider that the suggestion that third class railway passenger traffic should be stopped is not one that can be adopted. It would make invidious distinctions between classes and would cause great inconvenience and hardship. It would also not be effective; it would offer no check to the spread of the disease otherwise than by railway and would not prevent the chance of infection being carried by persons choosing to take first or second class tickets. 5. It was determined at the Dresden Conference that medical intervention should be limited to an inspection of the travellers and to the case of the sick. It would then, in the opinion of the Govern- ment of India, be unjustifiable to detain passengers by railway merely c6
?42 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. on the ground that they come from an area infected with plague. But in determining whether passengers should be detained or not the widest discretion should be exercised by inspecting officers and any person who is at all suspicious either by reason of his appearance, symptoms or the dirty condition of his clothes or effects should not be permitted to proceed without being placed under observation. The Government of India also think that measures similar to those pre- scribed in Part I of the Notification No. 58-XVI-404-B., issued by the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh on 12th February last under the Epidemic Diseases Act, should be taken so as to secure a record of the arrival at their homes of all travellers from the infected area who are not, owing to their suspicious appearance, detained at the inspection station, and a prompt report of any sus- pected cases that may occur in the villages in which they live. In these measures and the vigorous cleansing of these towns lie, in the opinion of the Government of India, the most effective means of pre- venting the plague from entering a province. Telegram No. 937-G., dated Abu, the 16th March 1897. No. 9 From-The Agent to the Governor-General, Rajputana, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I have telegraphed to Bombay:-Begins. No. 936-G. Plague is endemic at Palanpur. Experience shows that unless railway traffic is regulated plague spreads from station to station. Two men from Palanpur have been stopped with plague at Abu road and if this continues plague may become endemic there and extend into Raj- putana. Palanpur people should I think be prevented from booking from Palanpur up country unless they have gone through quarantine at Palanpur. If His Excellency approves I shall be glad if this can be arranged. Ends. Telegram No. 1090, dated Calcutta, the 25th March 1897.  No. 10. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Agent to the Governor-General, Rajputana. Your telegram No. 937-G., dated 16th. Plague at Palanpur. Government of India are opposed to establishment of absolute quaran- tine against plague infected places. All past experience shows that such quarantine is certain to be ineffective and it causes great in- convenience and hardship besides giving rise to opportunities of oppression and extortion. Government of Bombay have been request- ed to prevent all suspicious persons from booking for Palanpur and you should detain and keep under observation all suspicious persons
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 43 from Palanpur. Other persons from Palanpur should be watched after arrival. The class of persons who when they enter a town can neither be traced nor depended on to give information of plague amongst them should be treated as suspicious. So also should all persons who are suspicious by reason of their appearance, symptoms or the dirty condition of their clothes and effects. No. II. No. 1149-G., dated Abu, the 27th March 1897. From-The Agent to the Governor General, Rajputana, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No. 1090, Sanitary, of the 25th instant. In my telegram No. 937-G., I did not mean to propose to establish absolute quarantine against Palanpur, but to stop booking from that station by requiring persons to go through quarantine before they were allowed to enter the train. My object was to check the rapid migration of persons from a plague- infected locality. The platform inspections which are carried out in Rajputana are-most useful if the plague-infected area is distant and there is consequently time for plague symptoms to appear before the passenger arrives at the inspection station. Now that the plague is established at Palanpur, it is obvious that, if unrestricted traffic is allow- ed, there is a great risk that passengers who are infected with plague may pass undetected through our inspection stations. A report has just been received of a sepoy from Deesa being detained at Bandikui as a plague patient. Placing impediments in the way of railway travelling from Palanpur will not be an effective protection against plague, but measure will be useful. The 246 third class passengers who as I reported booked from Palanpur seem more likely to convey infection than a number of persons travelling slowly by road. 2. The order which the Government of Bombay have been request- ed to issue, namely, to prevent all suspicious persons from booking from Palanpur will, I submit, meet the object which I had in view, if that Government construe the expression "suspicious persons" in the manner indicated in your telegram. It would be an additional precaution if the booking of third class passengers to up country stations from stations near Palanpur were prohibited. If persons booking from Palanpur are subjected to close examination and are liable to be prevented from travelling, people will no doubt travel by road to stations above or below Palanpur and book from there. It would be in the public interests to prevent this; but even if it is not prevented, the restrictions on booking from Palanpur will be good as the road journey in the open air will tend to disinfect the travellers.
?44 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. 3. I had already before the receipt of your telegram issued orders regarding the detention of suspicious persons arriving from Palanpur and the neighbouring stations. By the instructions conveyed in your telegram I understand that suspicious persons from Palanpur who alight at a station are to be detained and not that all suspicious persons from Palanpur are to be removed from the train and detained. Of course those who are suspicious by reason of their showing symp- toms of plague are removed from the trains; but I could not, except where a European Medical Officer is appointed, direct the removal of persons who are suspicious for the reasons mentioned in your telegram.

?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 45 2. I am to say that you are right in understanding that the in- structions conveyed in my telegram No. 1090-Sanitary, dated the 25th March, were to the effect that all suspicious persons from Palan- pur who alight at a station in Rajputana should be detained, and not that all suspicious persons from Palanpur, apart from those who are suspicious by reason of their showing symptoms of plague, should be removed from the train. 3. In paragraph 2 of your letter you allude to the danger of intending travellers eluding the observation at Palanpur Railway Station by making a road journey to a neighbouring station above or below Palanpur. To lessen this danger the Government of Bombay have been requested to examine and if necessary to detain suspicious persons leaving Palanpur by road at the time of leaving and on arrival at any neighbouring railway station in the manner prescribed in Rule No. 5 of the Rules published by the Government of Bombay in Notification No. 1728-1201-P., dated the 29th March 1897 (of which a copy is enclosed).

Your telegram 934, dated 12th instant. Suggestion as regards quarantine against this Presidency having been considered by the Government of India, this Government have nothing further to say on the point, but with regard to the second portion of your telegram this Government would venture to protest strongly against suggestion that quarantine should not be permitted in selected places. Villagers already in accordance with the custom of the country in dealing with cholera impose quarantine of their own accord against plague-infected villages in the Thana and Surat Districts. In some towns and places specially liable to infection limited quarantine has with good results so far been imposed by District Magistrates, Political Agents, etc. Quarantine, even if not thoroughly effective, checks large movements of people and persons flying from an area, where active remedial and disinfective operations are anticipated, will avoid going to a town where there is quarantine. Moving about should be prevented by all possible means. Quarantine need not be universal even when applied, but it is specially important to apply it to the class of people who when they enter a town can neither be traced nor depended on to give information of plague amongst them. Concealment of plague by such persons presents the greatest obstacles to suppressing an outbreak. Medical inspection though valuable does not detect cases that are

As regards third point in your telegram there is no intention of stopping third class railway traffic generally and this will not be done in any particular case without most cogent reasons. As respects disinfection of clothing of pas- sengers suggested by Government of India, this Government will en- deavour to arrange. Telegram No. 1089, dated Calcutta, the 25th March 1897. No. 16. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Depart- ment. Your telegram No. 975-P., dated 17th. Land Quarantine. Gov- ernment of India adhere to opinion that absolute quarantine at one place, against another, should not be established. They agree, however, that all suspicious persons should be stopped and placed under observation, and class of persons mentioned in your telegram who, when they enter a town, can neither be traced nor depended on to give information of plague amongst them, should be treated as sus- picious. Similar remarks apply to third class railway traffic. Only suspicious persons should be prevented from travelling or detained, but widest latitude should be given to inspecting medical and other officers in determining whether an individual is suspicious or not. With regard to particular case of Palanpur about which Agent to Governor-General has telegraphed to you, no suspicious person should be allowed to book from Palanpur, but absolute quarantine should not be established against Palanpur. Government of India will be glad to be kept informed of condition of affairs at Palanpur. No. 1167, dated Calcutta, the 29th March 1897. No. 17.

Telegram from the Medical Officer, Maharaja Scindia, dated 24th March 1897. and which were indicated in my telegram No. 934, dated the 12th March, hold good in the case of the imposition of quarantine by one local area against another local area. Such quarantine, besides being opposed to the principles that have been repeatedly affirmed by those who have most studied the subject, is sure to be ineffectual, to give rise to hardship and oppression, and very possibly it may foster outbreaks of the disease. The only circumstances under which the imposition of strict quarantine is possible and likely to be effectual is when the outbreak occurs in a small place, the inhabitants of which can be easily and surely isolated and then the isolation must be most carefully regu- lated and controlled and proper sanitary precautions must be taken. The recent outbreak in the village of Khandraoni in the Gwalior State affords an instance of this kind. An account of the outbreak and of the measures adopted to stamp it out is given in the correspon- dence which is forwarded with this let- ter for the in- formation of the Governor in Council. The circum- stances were exceptionally favourable in- asmuch as the village is small, it was found easy to isolate the in- habitants, and a Commissioned Medical Officer of experience was deputed to the spot, and the adoption of all possible sanitary precautions and the prevention of extortion and oppression thus secured. The larger the place and the less complete its isolation, the greater become the difficul- ties and the point is very soon reached when they are insurmount- able. 3. It is these considerations that have led the Government of India to consider that the rules framed for the protection of local areas

Rule 26 empowers District Magistrates, when they consider it necessary, to impose quarantine at any place or places against any other place or places. Rule 29 empowers District Magistrates, with the sanction of the Commissioner, to prohibit intercommunication between any place and any other places.

Read, A.M.S., Joint Plague Commissioner, dated April 1897, relative to the necessity for quarantine measures as a preventive against the spread of bubonic plague. Dated Bombay, the April 1897. From-SURGEON-MAJOR W. L. READE, A.M.S., Joint Plague Commis- sioner to the Government of Bombay, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay. With reference to General Department No. 1976-1449-P., views of Government of India regarding land quarantine dated 12th April 1897, I cannot but think that the principles of local and general quaran- tine should, for administrative purposes, be kept quite distinct, and
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 49 I would urge that in conceding the principles of land quarantine the Government of India would not be inconsistent in the view which I understand has been enunciated in their behalf at the Venice Confer- ence, with regard to the quarantining of arrivals from India at European ports. That plague follows the lines of human intercourse and is spread by human beings is written large in the Epidemiological History of the human race, and every succeeding epidemic, including the present one, amply bears this out; it can only spread along these lines. The great spread of the disease which has occurred in the Bombay Presidency is due to the hurrying crowds of panic-stricken people, who, as a rule, are rushing from the place of greatest infection, many in their fear deserting their dead and dying relatives; it is these panic-stricken people that it is so essential to catch, almost as much as an individual enveloped in flames, who, by his flight, not only in- jures himself, but may bring devastation on others. Unfortunately the bacillus of plague is not of a luminant nature, hence the necessity of quarantining all suspects. Absolute quarantine is an admitted hardship, it paralyses trade and dislocates the ordinary routine of every day life, it should there- fore be enacted in a common sense manner and interpreted in a spirit of expediency. By a liberal grant of what may be called sanitary passes, the hardships of quarantine can be largely mitigated. The scheme of quarantine is to impound all persons and effects, who, from the locality they come from, and also from the purport of their journey, are likely to be spreaders of the disease. If the power to sign sanitary passes was given to a certain number of responsible officials, the spirit and practical effects of quarantine would be enforced. Because quarantine is not made absolute it by no means follows that the measure is inoperative. Every plague case is a possible focus of infection and every person that is kept within quarantine limits is a possible centre of infection that has been repressed. There is no disease that can so readily be smothered in its initial stage, therefore an occasional case that may escape the scrutiny of the quarantine officials would do but little harm; it is when many escape that the disease becomes heightened up into epidemic dimensions and it becomes difficult to keep it in check. Local quarantine may be divided into:- (a) Camps of observation for people leaving an infected area to prevent the spread of disease into the districts. (b) Camps of observation for arrivals from infected districts to prevent the reinfection of a place already infected. c 7
50 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. (c) Camps of observation in districts which have not as yet been infected for arrivals from infected districts. In a well regulated quarantine camp, where strict disinfection and supervision is carried out, the fear of the spread of the infection is infinitesimal, and if it does spread it shows a badly regulated camp. This has been amply proved in the Poona segregation camp, where the average number of inhabitants have been as much as 800, and yet in the period of over a month only some 30 cases have occurred, and these were probably infected on arrival, for it must be remembered that these people were all relatives or friends taken from the infected houses. The non-success of the camps at Karrachi was due to the fact which I pointed out in my report on this place, that no preliminary disinfection had been carried out and no supervision had been exer- cised. They were camps minus any quarantine restrictions whatso- ever. There is evidence in several instances in this epidemic of infected clothes brought to a village previously clear and the plague breaking out, although the people who brought the clothes remained free from the disease. The ideal attitude of a populace in plague time should be one of quiescence, and it cannot be too earnestly impressed on all that this disease can be successfully fought in the place in which it occurs, and that every endeavour should be made to keep the people within the infected area until the fight is over. The principle of general sea quarantine is a much more involved question, and it will vary according to the tanacity of life of the bacillus which causes the disease. Fortunately the microbe, that is responsible for the spread of this disease, is a microbe of very small verile power; it is killed in weak antiseptic solutions, and recent bactereological investigations tend to show that this bacillus quickly succumbs to the attacks of the other non-pathogenic bacteria who are always present, that in fact infected clothing and rooms will in time disinfect themselves. In what time this auto-disinfection will take to carry out will be for future researches to show, but there is some evidence going to prove that this process is carried out in less than a week. That clean merchandise can become infected is highly improbable, that it can carry it for more than 24 hours is quite impossible, as the bacillus must perish for want of pabulum. This may be asserted with abso- lute certainty both from bactereological evidence and also the import- ant negative evidence that no case of the transmission of the disease to Europe through merchandise has been reported, or even so far as
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 51 my knowledge goes to Aden or Suez, although there was free com- munication between these Ports and Bombay. Had infection by means of merchandise been possible, it must have occurred, as it is in my personal knowledge that cotton bales in Karrachi were packed by a community who, at the time, were suffer- ing greatly from the ravages of the plague. It may therefore be affirmed that while local quarantine is necessary in combating the disease; that all evidence goes to prove that general sea quarantine is unnecessary, when the port of arrival is a week distant from the affected port, so that practically it may be said that quarantine out- side Indian limits ought to be unnecessary. I feel sure that it would be true and statesman-like policy to freely accept the fact of the communicability of this disease along the lines of human intercourse, a fact which stands out in every history of this disease, and moreover a fact that will be emphasised when the history of the present visitation comes to be written. Should this be accepted and acted on by the Government of India, it is quite certain that it would inspire the European Powers with a confidence that the true nature of the disease is known and acted on in India, and it would go a long way towards breaking down the pro- tective quarantine which at present exists and which is liable to be put on again in another epidemic of the plague in India. The communicability of this disease must be well known to all medical authorities on whom these Powers rely for advice, and the rigorous quarantine which has been enacted is probably largely due to the half-hearted acceptance of this fact on the part of the Indian authorities. I hope in this letter that it will not be considered that I have ex- pressed my views too frankly. I have done so from an honest con- viction of their truth. No. 20.

I am to add that the difficulty of redrafting these two rules so as to literally coincide with the views of the Government of India is so great that Government would prefer to keep their own rules with proper safe- guards against their abuse in practice. No. 1602, dated Simla, the 28th May 1897. No. 21. From-J. P. HEWETT, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 1680-P., dated the 27th April 1897, forwarding, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter from Surgeon-Major W. L. Reade, A.M.S., Joint Plague Commissioner, on the subject of quarantine measures as a preventive against the spread of bubonic plague. 2. Upon the question of land-quarantine the opinions of the Govern- ment of India have already been plainly expressed. They thoroughly approve of the detention of suspicious persons under observation, and fully recognise that such detention results in the detection of cases of which there is no outward and visible sign at the time the passenger is detained. But such detention is very different to the imposition of absolute quarantine or the absolute prohibition of inter-communication between different places such as are authorised in Rules 26 and 29, respectively, of the new edition of the General Rules under Act III of 1897, published in the Resolution of the Government of Bombay, No. 1728-1201-P., dated the 29th March 1897. It was pointed out in my letter No. 1289, dated the 14th April 1897, that the rules referred to are not in accordance with the instructions contained in this Department telegram No. 1089, dated the 25th March 1897, and this Department letter No. 1167, dated the 29th March 1897, and it was stated that the Government of India would be glad to learn whether the rules in question had been modified. A reply to this question is contained in your letter No. 2565-1979-P., dated the 11th instant, in which it is stated that the views of the Government of India, as contained in my letter No. 1167, dated the 29th March 1897, were communicated to all the officers concerned with the working of Rules 26 and 29, that absolute quarantine is not in practice imposed
?APP. VIII. ]                    spread of infection by land.                    53 and that the rules are worked in such a way as the Governor in Council believes would not afford ground for objection on the part of the Government of India. It is further stated that the difficulty of redrafting the two rules so as to literally coincide with the views of the Government of India is so great that the Government of Bombay would prefer to keep their own rules with proper safeguards against their abuse in practice. 3. In reply to these remarks I am to say that the Government of India regret that they must adhere to the opinion that is open to grave objection to maintain rules which authorise the practice, which they consider to be most mischievous, of imposing absolute quarantine, or the absolute prohibition of communication between different places, even though orders are issued explaining that the rules may not be carried out in their entirety. The Government of India are assured that it is unnecessary to recall to the Government of Bombay the orders that they have issued on the subject of land-quarantine and they have no doubt that these orders are now being obeyed. But they are unable to accept the view that it is not possible to give expres- sion to these orders in such a manner as to obviate the necessity of retaining Rules 26 and 29, which authorise an action which is really contrary to them. The subsidiary orders issued in the Resolutions of the Government of Bombay, No. 1976-1449-P., dated the 12th April 1897, and No. 2124-A.-1583-A. P., dated the 21st April 1897, are in accordance with the views of the Government of India, and I am to suggest that if orders issued applying the principles on which these resolutions are based to persons leaving an infected area by railroad or other means and to persons arriving at healthy places by any such means from an infected area there would be no necessity for retaining Rules 26 and 29. The Government of India trust that the Govern- ment of Bombay will now cancel these two rules. 4. I am in particular to remark that the Government of India are strongly of the opinion that it is undesirable to prescribe as in the case of the rules for Mahableshwar and Panchgani published in the Resolution of the Government of Bombay, No. 1496-955-P., dated the 17th March 1897, that all except certain exempted persons, who would no doubt be medically examined, should be treated as suspi- cious. The detention of persons likely to carry infection should be secured by giving to the medical officers deputed to inspect travellers the widest discretion to stop any person who is at all suspicious, whether by reason of his symptoms, appearance or the dirty condition of his clothes, or who comes from an infected locality and belongs to the class of people, who, on entering a town, can neither be traced nor are likely to give information of cases of plague occurring among

The general result in the two cases would probably not differ greatly, but the Government of India consider that inspecting by the inspection officer in the manner described above is the proper and the fair way of arriving at that result, and that it is most inexpedient to treat all persons except those belonging to certain exempted classes as suspicious. The Government of India therefore think that the rules for Mahableshwar and Panchgani referred to above ought to be modi- fied so as to be brought into accordance with their views expressed above. No. 22. Government of Bombay Notification No. 5391-3495-P., dated the 5th  October 1897. The following rules are sanctioned by Government under the Epidemic Diseases Act (III) of 1887 :- *1. When any town or village or group of villages has, in the opinion of the Magistrate of the District, become so seriously infected -with plague as to justify the measure, the District Magistrate may declare such town or village or group of villages to be an infected area and appoint one or more resident Plague Authorities, who should in- variably be persons of known and approved character and responsible position, for such infected area, and may give notice to the Railway Authorities at any station within 20 miles of such infected area not to book any passenger unless such passenger either produces a pass signed by a resident Plague Authority, or a certificate from such special officer as may be appointed in that behalf or, where no such special officer has been appointed, from the patel and village account- ant of his village (such village not being within the said infected area) that he is a resident of such village and has only just quitted it. 2. The District Magistrate may prohibit the departure of any person or classes of persons from an infected area, except under passes granted by a resident Plague Authority appointed by the District Magistrate, and may set up the gates, chowkies, etc., and, with the sanction of the Commissioner, employ the establishment necessary to enforce this order : provided that any person shall be entitled to a pass who has been segregated to the satisfaction of the resident Plague Authority (t) in charge of the segregation quarters for seven days without exhibiting any sign of infection. The pro- hibition mentioned in this rule must not be issued until segregation quarters have been erected outside the town or village.

When the District Magistrate has applied Rule 2 to any place or group of villages, no person from such place or from any village of such group may go and reside in any other place or village, whether within or without the same group, without a pass in that behalf from the resident Plague Authority. To spend a night in any place consti- tutes residence under this rule. It shall be the duty of every village officer to prevent persons from residing in his village in breach of this rule. District Magistrates should be instructed to issue notices, which should be posted up in every village chavdi, prohibiting the entry into the village site of any person coming from an infected area without a pass from the resident Plague Authority-if a resident Plague Author- ity has been appointed for such area-or the entry of persons show- ing any signs of plague. This notice, copies of which should be given to all officiating patels and village accountants, should state that the patel and village accountant will be dismissed if the order is dis- obeyed. * Notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, it shall rest with the District Magistrate, at his discretion, to exempt from the necessity of taking out passes persons who are merely returning from an infected area to their own village after bringing to market in such infected area articles of food or fuel; Provided that such return be within eight hours after arrival, and not after sunset, and that this exemption shall not apply to any such person who may have entered a dwelling-house within the in- fected area. 4. The passes to be issued by the resident Plague Authority may be of two kinds, either (1) general or (2) special. General passes may be given to agriculturists and others having occasion to make daily or frequent journeys by road, rail or boat from an infected area, and may be given for an indefinite period ; but they will not cover residence outside of the infected area, and will not cover journeys by rail unless that is expressly stated on them. In the case of agricul- turists, where the resident Plague Authority is satisfied that it is necessary for the whole family to go and work in the fields, a single pass may be given for the family, but there must be a separate pass for each person making a railway journey under a general pass. Special passes shall be passes permitting persons to leave the infect- ed area and reside elsewhere, and may be granted for households, * Inserted by Notification No. 5608-A.-3596-P., dated 14th October 1897.

General passes should be given freely, and in the case   of agri- culturists  working  in  the fields need not be revoked even should a case of plague occur in the family of the passholder.    It   shall   be  in the discretion of the District Magistrate to exempt all persons making frequent journeys by road or boat from the   necessity   of  taking  out general   passes, and to direct that only persons appearing to be leav- ing the infected area by road  or  boat to  reside   elsewhere  shall be detained at  the  chowkies  unless  they possess special passes.    All persons travelling in or with carriages and carts, or carrying luggage of  any kind,   or  having women and children with them (unless they are believed to be agriculturists) may be  presumed   to  be intending to go and reside elsewhere. 6.  Special passes may also be given freely, especially at the begin- ning of an epidemic, when the resident Plague Authority  is   satisfied that no case of plague has occurred in the house of the applicant, or in any adjacent house or among any of his relations or  associates:  pro- vided that the resident Plague Authority may always require the  dis- infection   in  a prescribed manner of all clothes and other articles to be taken away before a pass is given.    When the applicant is known or suspected to have been exposed to infection, the   resident   Plague Authority shall defer granting the pass until the applicant  has   been kept under medical observation (1) for a period which may extend   to ten   days, (2) or until the reasons for suspicion have disappeared.    In such cases disinfection of clothes, etc., should always be  insisted   on. In this rule applicant   includes   all   the   persons  in   a  household   on whose behalf a special pass is applied for. 7.  Every person appearing to be sick when applying for  a  ticket at a railway station booking  office,   or  passing a  chowki  outwards, shall  be   stopped   and   sent to   the   resident   Plague   Authority or a Medical Plague Authority, unless his pass specifies his sickness. 8.  When there is a town or   large  village   in   the   vicinity  of  an infected area, the District Magistrate may establish camps   of  obser- vation at such town or large village against persons coming from   an infected  area,   and   may   detain in such camps all suspected persons coming from   such area  without  passes  from   the  resident  Plague Authority. 9. The District Magistrate may appoint an inspecting Plague Authority to tour constantly about all villages within a radius of 20 miles from an infected area for which a resident Plague Authority has been appointed.

Nothing in these rules shall render it necessary for any  Euro- pean,   or any Government official, or any railway employ proceeding by rail on duty, to obtain any pass, special or general, and the District Magistrate may in his discretion extend this exemption to the families and attendants of such persons. No. 23. No. 2349, dated Simla, the 26th October 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT,  Esq.,  C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 1847-P., dated the 13th instant, on the subject of pre- cautionary measures to prevent the spread of plague from Palanpur, and to the rules issued by the Government of Bombay in the Resolu- tion, No. 5391-3495-P., dated the 5th instant, alluded to in your telegram. These rules for the control of the movement of people from infected localities have been carefully considered by the Govern- ment of India, and I am to convey the following remarks with regard to them. 2. In the first place it appears to the Government of India that although the wording of rules 5 and 6 is elastic, the general tenor of the rules is such as to give an indirect encouragement to land quaran- tine, and that the plague authorities charged with working them might easily, unless their action is very carefully supervised, utilise them for. c 8
?58                            Measures to prevent the                 [ APP. VIII. the imposition of such quarantine. The Government of Bombay are aware that the Government of India have been from the outset, for reasons which have been fully explained, strongly averse to the imposi- tion of land quarantine. This view has been endorsed by the recent Sanitary Conference at Venice, and must be strictly followed by the authorities in India. The Governor General in Council therefore considers it essential that the rules must be worked with discretion and under careful supervision, and that it is incumbent on the Government of Bombay to make arrangements to ensure that no action is taken under them which would amount practically to the imposition of land quarantine. 3.  In the second place the Government of India consider  that the form of the rules is open to objection, inasmuch as it exempts   certain classes of persons from their operation.    Thus, under rule  5, agricul- turists working in the fields may continue to use general passes even though a case of plague should occur in the family of the passholder, and rule 12 states that it shall not be necessary for any   European or any Government official, or any railway   employ  proceeding by rail on duty, to obtain any pass, and that the District Magistrate   may  in his discretion extend this exemption to the families and attendants of such persons.    The views held by the   Government of  India on   the subject of the form of rules to control  the   movement of people   were explained in paragraph 4 of my letter No. 1602, dated the   28th May 1897, with regard to the special case of the   regulations  for the pro- tection of Mahableshwar from the spread of infection. The Government of India are totally opposed to any interference with the ordinary avo- cations of persons who are not sick or suspicious, but in their opinion it is wrong to exempt special classes of persons from the operation of the rules.    The principle which should govern the   rules is that they should apply to all classes, but that detention should be enforced only in the case of such persons as are   considered   " suspicious "   by   the responsible officer in the exercise of the wide discretion   described in the Notification of  the Government of Bombay,   No.   3285-2425-P., dated the 15th June 1897.    I am to request that, with the   permission of the Governor in Council, the  form of the rules may  be   revised in the sense of these remarks. 4.  Rule 2 fixes the period of segregation for applicants for passes whom it is considered necessary  to detain   for  seven   days.    In  the opinion of the Government of India, this period should be raised to ten days, the term fixed by the  Venice   Sanitary  Convention.    It is not safe to permit the departure of a suspicious person until he has  been kept in segregation for the full ten days' period.   A similar alteration is required in rule II.
?APP. VIII. ]                  spread of infection by land.                       59 5. In conclusion, I am to say that the Governor General in Council is convinced that these elaborate rules for the control of the move- ment of people from infected localities will be powerless to check the spread of the disease unless they are accompanied by stringent measures to suppress the malady within the infected areas, Indeed it appears to His Excellency in Council that in the absence of such measures the compulsory detention of the inmates in infected localities will tend to foster the growth of the epidemic, and to establish plague foci whence the disease may spread with even greater virulence than if no measures had been devised to prevent the egress of the inhabi- tants. His Excellency in Council is therefore strongly of opinion that the most important object to aim at is, not the control of the movement of the people, but the adoption of such well-devised and stringent measures as will prevent the occurrence of plague cases from engendering fresh dangerous plague centres, whence the infec- tion will certainly spread in spite of all efforts to confine it. Experi- ence has shown that the measures upon which reliance may be placed to effect this end are in outline- (1)   The prompt detection of cases by (a) search parties, and (b) better registration of deaths. (2)  The removal of the sick to segregation hospitals. (3)   The detention in segregation of healthy occupants of infect- ed houses. (4)   The evacuation of infected quarters. (5)  The cleansing and disinfection of infected houses and quarters. (6)   General sanitary improvements,  such as the   abatement   of overcrowding  and   the   improvement of   ventilation   and drainage. His Excellency in Council is convinced that the general adoption of these measures in all places in which plague exists is essential, and the only means by which the danger of the general dissemination of the disease which now unfortunately exists can be averted. His Excellency in Council therefore trusts that every effort will be made to adopt these all-important precautions with general promptitude and vigour. In your telegram No. P.-1571-P., dated the 23rd Septem- ber, it is stated that district officers understand the necessity for evacuating infected houses in rural tracts, and that the rain had hitherto made the provision of segregation camps a matter of very great difficulty and in some cases impossibility. Now that the rainy season is over, this difficulty will have been removed, but the Govern- ment of India are without further information as to what steps are actually being taken to ensure the evacuation of infected houses and localities. They would be glad to receive an assurance that this, as
?60                          Measures to prevent the                  [ APP. VIII. well  as  the  other  necessary  precautions,  are being generally and thoroughly carried out. 6. With regard to the special case of Palanpur, I am to say that, subject to the remarks made in the preceding paragraph, the Govern- ment of India have no objection to the imposition of the Regulations of the 5th instant at Palanpur, and in especial the enforcement of the provision of rule I which deals with the subject of the railway pas- senger traffic. In your telegram of the 13th instant it is stated that the latter portion of my telegram of the 8th instant beginning " quarters at Palanpur " is not understood. The meaning of the pas- sage in question was that the Government of India desired to know whether the infected portions of the town of Palanpur had been evacuated and the residents detained in segregation. The Governor General in Council attaches the utmost importanee to the adoption of all possible means to stamp out the dangerous epidemic in Palanpur.

Government of India fear it will be impossible to arrange for passes to non-suspected persons at all stations from which booking is to be stopped, and arrangements proposed are not in accordance with views expressed in my telegram No. 1278 of 13th April. Would it not be possible to arrange for stoppage and isolation of all suspected persons at Rohri itself ? On the Shikarpur side the Indus crossing can presumably be guarded. Government of India would be glad to learn what arrangements have been made for cleansing Rohri, evacuating infected quarters and providing for infected persons there. Daily telegrams show 25 cases in Shikarpur District between 8th and 15th May. How many of these occurred at Rohri?

Meaning of suggestion in my telegram 1514 of 18th May that all suspected per- sons should be stopped and isolated at Rohri itself is that instruc- tions prescribed for Sukkur in my telegram 1278, dated 13th April, should be applied at Rohri for protection of Punjab and other places, namely, that all passengers booking at Rohri should be immediately examined, inspecting officer being given wide discretion to retain under observation all persons who are suspicious by reason of their symptoms, appearance or state of their clothes and all persons unable to give satisfactory addresses and who are not likely to be traced or give information of plague cases. If it is considered necessary to stop booking at stations in neighbourhood of Rohri to prevent evasion of inspection, Government of India would not object to this course; but this is all they can consent to, and they request that the prohibition against booking to the remainder between Rohri and Reti may be withdrawn.

There is serious risk of plague extending to Quetta, owing to number of arrivals here from Karachi and infected towns in Sind. Two hundred such arrivals in last five days. If plague reaches Quetta, it will probably extend to Afghanistan. It seems to me only effective means of prevention is imposition of quarantine. Jacobabad is imposing quarantine on all arrivals from Sukkur, Shikarpur, Kotri, Hyderabad, Larkana, and Karachi, and I would strongly recommend that similar quarantine should, with permission of Commissioner in Sind, be imposed at Jacobabad on all native third class and inter- mediate class passengers for Baluchistan from these places except perhaps servants of first and second class passengers. I could establish quarantine at Sibi, but though better than nothing this would not be nearly as effective as quarantine at Jacobabad, as pas- sengers might alight at intervening stations. With quarantine on railway passengers at Jacobabad, it should be almost impossible for disease to reach Baluchistan owing to intervening desert. I regard this as a matter of urgency as if done at all, it should be done at once before it is too late. No. 32. Telegram No. 1123, dated Simla, the 28th March 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan. Your telegram 100 of 26th, to Foreign. Government of India have in view of fact that land quarantine has always proved ineffective and that it affords opportunities for oppression and corruption and is likely to give rise to disease at places where it is enforced refused permission to establish it in other places in India. The fact that desert has to be crossed would render effective quarantine easier at Jacobabad than elsewhere, and in view of possibility of plague advancing by Baluchistan to Afghanistan the considerations stated above may in present instance be outweighed by political considera- tions. But if quarantine is to be imposed it should, in the opinion of Government of India, be imposed within British Baluchistan and not in Sind. Would it be possible to make arrangements at Jhatpat within your jurisdiction? If quarantine is imposed, it must, in the
?64 Measures to prevent the                  [ APP. VIII. opinion of the Government of India, apply to all passengers by whatever class they are travelling and whatever their race. And it will be necessary to establish at quarantine stations separate camps for each day's arrivals as well as hospitals and to provide for ten days' segregation. In other instances Government of India have, while refusing to impose quarantine, given widest discretion to inspecting medical officer to detain any person who may, by reason of his symptoms, appearance, state of his clothes and effects or in any other way, appear suspicious.

Also as numerous refugees from  Sukkur  were found alighting desert stations and fleeing Kalat territory orders have issued   stopping  them alighting  and requiring them to proceed Sibi first for inspection.   In my opinion no measures short of this will prevent plague reaching   Baluchistan.    They   have worked   well   and are cordially approved by all classes of community even by those whose families are detained.    There has not been one complaint   and number  in camp yesterday after fortnight's working was only 304.    This is maximum as exodus from Sind is decreasing. Measures adopted are less  rigorous than those   taken   by  Bombay Government in Sind towns like Jacobabad where local   quarantine   is enforced and in interests of this  province   I strongly   deprecate any relaxation.

No. B. P./472, dated Surat, the 23rd March 1897. From-The District Magistrate, Surat, To-The Commissioner, Northern Division. I have the honour to forward herewith a correspondence which has been handed to me by Mr. Judge, Assistant Collector of Salt Revenue. 2.  I am informed from various sources that  plague   is   spreading fast through Daman territory. There is, therefore, a great likelihood that the Pardi Taluka will be infected if immediate steps are not taken. 3.  Mr. Judge has been good enough to offer the assistance of  the whole of his Daman Frontier Guard. This guard is stationed along the Kolak river and the railway line and therefore commands the fords and the level crossings. It could, to a great extent, if not entirely, prevent the ingress and egress of any one to and from Daman territory out of or into the Pardi Taluka except as regards a few villages west of the railway line, which would have to take care of themselves. 4.  As part of the Daman territory (Nagar Haveli) lies east   of the railway line, I would suggest that Portuguese Government  officials going to and fro should not be stopped unless actually suffering from plague.    Thus the administration will not be interfered with and the chief objection from the Portuguese point of view removed. 5.  But officials apart, I respectfully, but urgently, ask your sanction to the establishment of a  cordon by means of the Daman   Frontier Guard round Daman territory and  the bit of the Pardi  Taluka lying west of the railway line.
?APP. VIII.]                  spread of infection by land. 67 It is not enough to say that our villages can protect themselves. For though they may prevent strangers from infected places entering their limits, they will not prevent their own inhabitants from resorting to Daman territory to drink (as they do daily in crowds) and returning home, thus bringing infection with them. 6. As you will remember, Dr. Lowson, Plague Commissioner, during his visit to Surat, spoke strongly in favour of cordons.

From-The Commissioner, Northern Division, To-The District Magistrate, Surat. The District Magistrate's proposals are sanctioned.

I beg to append copies of my letter to the Governor of Daman and of my notification. I may add that the notification has been published in Guzerati in all the villages which will be affected by this measure." Extract, paragraph 1, of a letter from the District Magistrate, Surat, No. 631-B.P., dated the 3rd April 1897. "I have the honour to report that during the week ending 2nd instant, the cordon stopping all intercommunication between all places lying within and on the Daman side of the Daman Frontier line of the Salt Department and all places lying without and on the other side of that line was established. The Governor of Daman having asked me to arrange for the importation of mhowra flowers into Daman, his request was complied with on condition that the mhowra flowers be carried in British carts from the Daman road station to a certain place on the cordon line and there be transferred to Portuguese carts." Extract, paragraphs 1, 5, 6, 7, of a memorandum from the Commissioner, Northern Division, No. 130-Police, dated the 12th April 1897. "1. As plague is raging in Daman and the arrangements there are quite disorganised, the District Magistrate of Surat has, with the sanction of the Commissioner, prohibited intercommunication between Daman territory and eleven villages of the British taluka of Pardi on the one side and the rest of the British territory on the other. The eleven British villages have been included with Daman, because they were for convenience left on the other side of the Salt Depart- ment Preventive line which has been utilised for the purpose of a cordon. The object of the department was to get a straight line, and with this view they sacrificed a corner of British territory and left it outside. *              *              *              *                *              * "5. The Commissioner is convinced that these people have a real case and that the cordon cannot be kept on just as it is. The whole difficulty can be removed for the present by shifting the preventive line, i.e., the cordon, on to the territorial frontier line, instead of the artificial course which it now takes. Mr. Judge has been good enough to consent to arrange for this.
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 69 "6. This line will be longer and involve more strain on the men. The Mamlatdar should therefore instruct the patels and people of the II villages to assist by patrolling their own borders. If they allow people to go from British territory to Daman villages to drink or for any other purpose, or to come from Daman into British villages, the old cordon will be reverted to. They should also assist in build- ing temporary huts for the salt guards. "7. The only expense involved will be in erecting these temporary huts, and if the people assist, the cost will be very small. It is impossible to estimate what it will be at present, but probably not more than one or two hundred rupees. It is hoped that Government will be pleased to sanction this expenditure and approve of action being taken at once." No. 716-B. P., dated the 10th April 1897. From-R. A. L. MOORE, Esq., District Magistrate, Surat, To-F. S. P. LELY, Esq., Commissioner, Northern Division. I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the whole corre- spondence that has taken place about the cordon that has been placed round Daman territory and that part of the Pardi Taluka that is west of the railway line and south of the Kolak river. 2.  It will be perceived that I imposed   the  cordon under rule 29 of the rules under the Epidemic   Diseases Act after obtaining your sanction. 3.  The object of the cordon was to prevent the spread  of plague from Daman, where it is admittedly raging into British territory. Plague is stated by the best authorities, e.g., Dr. Lowson, Plague Commissioner, to be contagious, and a cordon is the surest way to prevent contact. 4.  The accompanying papers  will show that I  have  treated the Daman authorities with due courtesy  and have made every conces- sion possible without making the cordon futile. 5.  The concessions now demanded by His Excellency the Governor of Daman are such as, if granted, would   render the  cordon  entirely inoperative. Moreover, they are not necessary as supplies can be brought to Daman by sea. It is true that I have made a concession by which mhowra flower may be brought from the Damaun road station to the cordon in British carts and taken from thence in Portuguese carts to Daman. But I have only done this in order to avoid any show of discour- tesy to the Portuguese administration, and to prevent the possibility of difficulties arising between them and their Abkari contractor.
?70 Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. It would be highly inadvisable to extend this concession to materials, such as rice, grass and firewood, for this would mean continued streams of traffic from British territory and from Daman meeting at the cordon. Carters mixing at the meeting place would become subject to contagion, and undoubtedly facilities would be afforded to persons wishing to slip across from Daman into British territory. 6.  I beg to invite your special attention  to the  proposals  of   His Excellency the Governor of Damaun- (a) that persons should be allowed to take supplies into Little Damaun where he admits plague is raging from and through British territory and should be allowed to return into British territory, though the Portuguese have them- selves entirely cut off communication between Little and Big Daman; (b) that the dhobies of Little Daman should be allowed to wash clothes (sometimes probably plague stricken) in British rivers while they are debarred from using the river that flows between Big and Little Daman. Translated into plain English, this means that to save certain Portuguese subjects from inconvenience, British subjects are to under- go risks that His Excellency of Daman himself and the rest of the Portuguese subjects refuse to face. 7.  As for the statement that plague is confined  to Little   Daman, this is doubtless accurate at present, but what certainty is there that it will remain so? Moreover, how can the frontier guard distinguish between persons coming respectively from Big and Little Daman? 8.  I should like to point out in conclusion that the cordon imposed surrounds not only Portuguese territory, but also a portion of British territory, namely,   that  part  of   the   Pardi Taluka lying west of the railway line and south of the Kolak river. It cannot, therefore, be said with truth that foreign territory has been more harshly treated than our own. Perhaps, I may add that there seems to be an error in the popula- tion of Daman territory as stated by His Excellency the Governor in his letter under report (vis., 70,000, seventy thousand) ; the popula- tion of the adjoining Pardi Taluka which has four times the area of Daman territory numbers in round figures 60,000 (sixty thousand) only. Possibly His Excellency meant to write 7,000 (seven thousand). This is an important difference when the subject of supplies has to be considered.
?APP. VIII. ]                  spread of infection by land. 71 No. 127-Police, dated the 12th April 1897. From -The Commissioner, Northern Division, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. *                 *                 *                 *                  *                 *                 * 3.  It is to be noted that, however strict the measures of the  Dis- trict Magistrate of Surat, they are not more so than those adopted by the   Governor  of   Daman  for   protection   against  his   own   people. Plague having broken out in  Little   Daman, he has shut  himself   up in   Big   Daman  and   absolutely cut  off    all   communication.    It   is difficult to be sure of the facts, but it is credibly asserted that one day last   week   there    were   40 deaths   in   Little   Daman,   and   that   no segregation is enforced.    It   is said  there are isolated sheds, but no one is   removed there   unless he has no friends.    Things being thus disorganised, it is only fair that the British authorities should protect their own people as severely as His Excellency the Governor protects himself. 4.  His   Excellency  asks   firstly   that   goods   coming  by   rail   for Daman   may be allowed   to pass there from the railway station.    At present no person is  allowed   to enter  Daman  territory across the cordon, except   (1)   postal runners, (2) Portuguese officials, (3) Portu- guese subjects armed with a pass from the Mamlatdar of Pardi which is  only  granted  on   a certificate  from  a Portuguese authority if he comes from Portuguese territory or  from   a   British  authority  if  he comes  from   British   territory   to the  effect  that he is a Portuguese subject.    This arrangement is not objected to by the Governor.    The importance to British interests   of   making it  strict  is   that if large numbers   of persons cross  the  frontier, many of them will certainly want to come back and will bring infection with them.    More especi- ally it is necessary to stop the crowds of people who go into Portu- guese territory for the sake of the cheaper   drink   to   be   got   there. Unless they are kept at home, they will certainly bring in the plague. 5.  No goods whatever   are   allowed    to   enter   Daman   territory, except mhowra flowers which are  allowed  to be brought up to the cordon in British   carts   and   then   unloaded   into Portuguese   carts. This  embargo against practically all imports is too absolutely  to   be maintained.    There are many well-to-do Parsi families and others  in Daman who in case of  illness get such things as ice, fruit, medicine, from Bombay and at all times will be  much  inconvenienced   if  shut off altogether.    The gross amount is likely to be very small and may be allowed to pass without any real danger, just as mhowra now  is. Goods   brought by  rail   from   Bombay   to    Daman   road    railway station   should   be  brought in   British   carts  to    the   cordon,   and then transhipped into Portuguese carts with separate bullocks and
?72 Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. drivers. With reference to the Collector's remarks that supplies may be brought in by sea, it should be noted that this mode of carriage is not always possible, and that in a few days more or less the sea route will be made difficult by the monsoon winds. 6.  Secondly, the Governor asks that  goods   may   be   sent out of Daman    vi   the    railway   station    of   Daman   road under  a  pass signed by his delegate.   This concession is quite unnecessary.    Con- sidering the present state of Daman,  it would be fraught with danger to British subjects, and  the  embargo   can cause little or no   incon- venience to Daman,  from  which there is little to export at this time, and that little goes by sea. 7.  Thirdly, he asks that firewood, grain and grass may be allowed to pass from   the   outlying   Daman   Taluka   of    Nagar   Haveli into Damaun   across  the   cordon.    Now, this  is  a point  to be carefully considered.    The Commissioner has held a conference at Wapi   with a  number  of  persons  with  local   knowledge,   and   has ascertained that ordinarily a  very  considerable  traffic   in  firewood,   grain   and grass  flows into Daman from the east.    The Sirkarkun of   Customs, who has the best opportunities  of  knowing,   estimates   the   carts   at 100  per  day.    Now  it  is   clear  this  cannot be entirely stopped for long   without   causing  keen   distress.    There  are,   however,   some facts on the other side, (1) a good deal of grain   is not   for   local   use but  for   export   by  sea;   and   considering how little   claim  Duman has to consideration, this   might  be  stopped   for  a   while   without compensation ;   (2)   it   is  said by those who ought to know that by this time most  of   the   season's   grain and  grass has   already  gone into  Daman, and   that  in April and May little goes except firewood. Then, again, it is said (1) that firewood is selling  at half   the  usual price  east of the  cordon   because   large  quantities  are blocked up here, and (2)  that   it  is   getting  so  scarce at Daman that there is difficulty  in   burning the   dead.    The  whole question seems to   the Commissioner to   depend   on   what   the facts   are   at  Daman.    If the  price of  these   three  necessaries of life (grass,  grain  and fire- wood)   is going up   to  famine   pitch,   then   we are  bound  to  relax the  rule.    It  is  very   difficult   to   know   the  precise state of affairs in  Daman,  but  the   Commissioner   has   instructed   the   Sirkarkun, the   Mamlatdar,   and   the   Chief   Constable   to   make   independent inquiries ; and when they report distinct signs of distress, one or all of these commodities may be allowed to pass under the same precau- tions   as  already  adopted  for  mhowra  flowers.    If  necessary, the establishment must be increased and  every arrangement made  to prevent confusion and evasion.
?APP. VIII.]  spread of infection by land. 737 8. As to the fourth request, the Bhilad Railway station and Bamanpunja Naka should be on precisely the same footing and sub- ject to the same rules and relaxations as Damaun Road Railway station and its corresponding Naka. 9. As to the fifth request, there is no objection. 10. The settlement of the sixth request should be the same as for grass. The Sirkarkun, Mamlatdar, and Chief Constable should be on the lookout for signs of scarcity at Damaun. It is not the desire of Government to deprive the people there of meat, and when the price of meat rises to an excessive height, cattle should be allowed to pass in (but not out) on condition of changing attendants. 11. The seventh complaint about washing clothes, the Commis- sioner has not been able to understand. The Damanganga referred to by Mr. Moore is salt, so also is the Kalu. But the Portuguese dhobies have hitherto been allowed to resort to an upper reach of the Kalu within British territory, and also to the south bank of the Kolak. The local officers say positively that no change has recently been made. 12. The system of changing carts and cartmen is quite practicable as shown recently in the case of Pardi. Of course it will tend to diminish traffic, which is what is desired. The Commissioner is inclined to think it should be done not at chowky No. 15 but at the Chala Naka, for two reasons-(1) there is a superior staff at Chola and (2) it is desirable to keep the concourse at a distance from the village of Wapi. If it takes place near the village, many people will escape into the bazaar and the danger of infection from the Portu- guese carts is enormously increased. Undoubtedly the bundobust should be made at a distance from British population, i.e., a way out on the road at Chala. 13. It should be explained for the information of Government that the embargo is carried out by the salt preventive force along their preventive line which cuts off from the Surat and Thana districts, the whole of the Damaun territory except the Nagar Haveli, and also about eleven British villages. 14. The report of the Collector of Surat, with accompaniments, is appended. 15. The favour of very early orders is requested as the matter re- quires speedy handling as well as judicious.

In continuation of my letter No.M/370-P., dated 14th May 1897, I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, the accompanying copy of Memorandum by the Commissioner, Northern Division, No. police/205, dated 6th instant, relative to the danger of British territory being infected with plague from Damaun. Dated Camp Tithal, the 6th June 1897. Memo. by F. S. P. LELY, Esq., Commissioner, Northern Division. Various complaints have been made through several channels by the Portuguese authorities against the preventive measures adopted by the British Government against plague, but I submit the time has come when strong representations should be made in the reverse direction. We have far more reason to complain of them than they have to complain of us. 2. The position is briefly this. On the 4th March the first case of plague occurred in Damaun, and it rapidly spread until the daily mortality in a town of 8,000 people is said to have been 60 to 70. Up to this day the Government have done practically nothing to check its course. The Governor and all his responsible officers have persistently shut themselves up in the Fort and have done nothing personally. The only officer who ever visits the plague striken area is an " Administrator," who has no power to make himself felt and is virtually only a reporter. The medical attendance is most in- efficient. A doctor makes hurried visits every day from the Fort to the plague hospital, and a gentleman sent expressly from Goa has returned, being unable to get on with the authorities. Segregation is ordered but never enforced except in the case of friendless and low caste people who have no influence. Disinfection is a mere pretence. The whole working staff in Lower Damaun consists of
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 77 one Jemadar of Police and 18 sepoys. Being under on discipline, they devote themselves to making money, and allow the people to snap their fingers at orders. Mr. Judge informs me that the Govern- ment charges a fee of 14 annas for registration of deaths, but the Jemadar charges 4 annas for allowing non-registration, and naturally his receipts are the larger. A supply of lime for whitewashing was sanctioned and paid for, but ashes are said to have been substituted. The people flatly refused to go to the hospital and have been allowed to lie in their houses and die to the number, it is said, of 2,600 in a town of 8,000. 3. Thus Damaun is a standing menace to its neighbours- ourselves. It at present imposes on us the necessity of an observa.. tion camp supported by a cordon of over 300 men. If this was the temporary result of an epidemic which had been combated and crushed with the energy of a civilized nation, there would be nothing to say; but the action or rather inaction of the Portuguese leaves no hope of an early termination to all this cost and trouble. There are signs that the mortality in Damaun is abating, but as the houses remain infected they will continue to be centres of danger, and their occupants cannot be allowed to enter British territory without the greatest risk. There seems no end to it. 4. I am quite aware it would be useless to try to get the Portu- guese to enforce segregation on their Mahomedan and other unruly subjects. They have not the power to do it. But now that the disease is abating and will probably die out of local exhaustion, it is not too much to ask them to select some strong executive officer and give him powers to disinfect the houses and prevent a revival. Unless they can be induced to take this step, which amounts to an international obligation, there will be a source of plague on our borders probably for years. 5. Surgeon-Major Lyons having lately spent some time in Da- maun, enquiring into the results of inoculation, would probably be able to supply more information about the medical arrangements than if Government should wish to refer to him.

To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to reply to your telegram No. 1587 of 26th May last, regarding the measures to be taken on the Damaun Frontier, to prevent the spread of plague. At the same time, I am to forward
78 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. the relevant portions of a memorandum No. Police-212 of June 11th, 1897, by Mr. Lely, the Commissioner, Northern Division, and a copy of the plan of the Damaun Frontier which accompanied it. For a fuller understanding of the geographical position I am to invite reference to the trigonometrical survey sheets. The area referred to in Mr. Lely's memorandum lies on the west coast between 20 15' and 20 40' N. L. 2. The Northern Division, of which Mr. Lely is the Commis- sioner, comprises the districts of Thana and Surat, the seaboard of which has been so terribly ravaged by the plague. Now, happily the plague has ceased to manifest itself in epidemic form in either of these districts, but for months past the struggle to keep in check and then stamp out the disease has taxed the ingenuity and resources of Government and their officers to the utmost. In this period of difficulty and anxiety there has been, I am to inform you, no officer who has shown greater determination, more varied resources and sounder judgment than Mr. Lely. In effecting measures which have neces- sarily caused great inconvenience, no one has succeeded better in carrying with him and securing the co-operation of the people them- selves. No one has shown greater anxiety to temper the rigour of rules when practically feasible. Mr. Lely therefore is an officer who not only possesses in common with several other officers in this Presi- dency, a thorough practical knowledge of the general nature, the effects and the means of combating the plague; but who has special qualities of judgment and temper that make his advice of the very highest value. 3. At ordinary times the communication between the British villages and those in the territory of Damaun is free and constant; not only by reason of the contiguity of the villages and the kinship and caste brotherhood of their inhabitants, but because a large num- ber of persons habitually go from British into Damaun territory to drink the liquor which is much more cheaply bought there than at the shops on the British side of the frontier. One of the great les- sons of the spread of the plague in Western India is that its cause is almost if not exclusively the movement of people out of infected into uninfected areas. When once Damaun became infected therefore the danger to the villages of the Pardi Taluka became extreme. 4. Mr. Lely has shown with what remarkable success the people of that Taluka had protected themselves against infected British vil- lages; he has shown how the Damaun authorities attempted to pro- tect their territory and how owing to administrative weakness they failed. The British authorities had then a double object lesson before
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 79 them: on the one hand, the success of an efficient system of observa- tion and detention of suspicious persons; on the other, the terrible danger of a lax and inefficient system. His Excellency the Governor in Council fully concurs with Mr. Lely that if at this time the local British officers had failed to act with vigour and determination, they would have much to answer for. 5. In the telegram to which I am now replying it is stated that the Government of India entertain strong objections to the cordon which has been drawn between Damaun and British territory. It is possible that all the circumstances of the case are not fully under- stood. I have commented on the freedom of communication at or- dinary times; this however is personal communication; for customs purposes there exists a preventive force which patrols the frontier to prevent the illicit transport of commodities. This frontier is thirty eight miles in length and can be easily crossed at any point. The cordon is in fact merely the use of the existing force with some tem- porary addition to prevent persons crossing the frontier in such a way as to evade observation. Without this precaution whether the whole of the Damaun territory or only portions of it are regarded as an in- fected area and whether all or only certain persons coming from that infected area are to be regarded as suspicious, there will be no means of watching all who cross the frontier and of detecting those who are suspicious and require to be detained. 6. The account of the system of detention as now worked given in paragraph 10 of Mr. Lely's memorandum shows that none of the measures enforced are open to serious objection. They do not attempt the stringency of measures allowed by the Venice Sanitary Conven- tion of 1897, in Part III of which it is laid down that "each Govern- ment is at liberty to close its frontiers to passengers and goods." It will also appear that the restrictions on the transport of goods are only such as are necessary to prevent the conveyance of infection. Goods are allowed to be transported without restriction provided arrange- ments are submitted to, which prevent the passage of infected carts and drivers into British territory. 7. It would no doubt be possible, were they available, to appoint Commissioned Medical Officers to various points on the frontier to stop suspicious persons. But this would not do away with the neces- sity for using the frontier force as the agency for directing all traffic into the channels where it must come under observation; and it would not, as the Commissioner shows, add very materially to the general convenience. It would, however, absorb one or more Commissioned Medical Officers whose services can be more usefully employed else- where, and it would involve the expense of erecting sheds, hospitals

From-The Commissioner, Northern Division, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. 2. First of all the net results may be summarized. The Pardi Taluka is the southernmost part of the Surat District. The next railway station to it on the north is Bulsar where 901 plague cases have occurred. The next Taluka on the North is Bulsar, where in all about 1,600 cases have occurred. On the south is the thinly popu- lated Mahal of Umbergaon in the Thana District, but beyond that the trunk railway runs through Dabanu, Bassein, and Salsette Talukas into Bombay, all of which country was reeking with the disease. In the month of March it broke out violently in Damaun. The deaths in Damaun town alone soon mounting up to 35 or 40 per diem in a population of about 5 to 8,000. Geographically this Portuguese posses- sion is a part of the Pardi Taluka and occupies its south-west corner. Large numbers of British subjects cross the frontier every day to drink at the cheap liquor shops and then return to their homes. The people on both sides are closely connected by intermarriage and by business and keep up constant intercourse. 3. In the midst of all these fires the 58,245 people of the Pardi Taluka have remained unscathed. Only a single indigenous case of plague has occurred, and that was a ward by in the segregation hos- pital at Pardi. There have been 24 imported cases. 4. In the first place it should be noted that the defence has been and is largely the work of the people themselves. In the month of February the Commissioner being in those parts called meetings of the people in Pardi town and in Wapi, the next most important village and railway station. He explained to them that if they would escape the fate of Bombay they must themselves protect their hearths and houses, and that they should resolutely keep out every stranger until it was proved by observation that he was free from infection. This suggestion was taken up so warmly that the people prevented even the staff of the Divisional officer who had been on tour in infected villages of Bulsar from entering the town of Pardi. Round many of the villages a line has been drawn with religious ceremonies which could not be crossed by any stranger. No doubt the inclination is to treat every one as "suspicious" without further ado, but the spirit of selfhelp displayed is highly gratifying and greatly tends to lighten the work of Government officers. Government would hesitate to break it down and insist on the villagers receiving within their gates
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 81 in a time of epidemic a man whom they honestly feared to be dangerous. It would be a terribly highhanded thing to do, for no one can positively say at such a time who is or is not the bearer of infection. 5. The Collector's orders have supplemented the determination of the people. The main points have been as follows. For Pardi town and railway station ten days' observation for all suspicious persons under the eye of the local medical officer, an experienced and capable men. As a fact very few people are allowed to pass as free from suspicions. Also goods coming in from or going to infected places are bound to change carts and drivers on the way. Here, again, it was practically presumed that every place was infected until it was proved otherwise, and with reports of plague from every quarter this could scarcely be called unreasonable. The protection of Pardi was the chief object of the campaign at first, for it was the gateway of the Taluka. At the next most important railway station, Wapi (Damaun Road), there was a segregation hospital with a special qualified medical officer. At the next, Udwada, there was also a hospital, and examination of passengers was made by the Patel with the assistance of local practitioners. At Bhilad it was done by the Patel. Meanwhile in all the villages the Patels were authorized to detain suspicious strangers at a distance for 10 days' observation. This as a fact was interpreted by the voluntary action of the people themselves to mean exclusion of all strangers except in special cases, and the result has been the saving of the district. 6. For some time Damaun territory was free from plague, and many refugees from stricken Bulsar being refused admission into British villages betook themselves in that direction. The Portuguese authorities had placed a cordon on the frontier to stop them, but it was corrupt and ineffective. Persons from Bombay and Bulsar carry- ing the plague in their clothes and kit were allowed to pass in, the consequence being that the fate which the people, aided by their Government, were resolutely warding off from themselves in the surrounding British territory, fell with terrible force on Damaun. At the end of February the crew of a ship who arrived from Karachi were allowed, in defiance of nominal rules, to land at night and a case soon after occurred among them. About the same time a woman who had come from Bulsar fell ill. From these beginnings the disease rapidly spread throughout the month of March, until in April it is credibly reported that in the small town of " Big Damaun " alone there were 60 to 70 cases per day. 7. The British villagers, though it would cause them inconveni- ence, wished to see all communication cut off, and if the position be C II
82 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. considered, it can scarcely be denied that if the local officers had not acted strongly, they would have had much to answer for. The con- stant intercourse going on with the stricken area for drinking, social and business purposes has been noticed above. Damaun town is very dirty and the annual home of cholera. The local authorities are so powerless that, if the Commissioner is rightly informed, they cannot even fine a sepoy without a reference to Goa. The police force is small and notoriously corrupt. The villages outside Damaun being almost all alienated, the Central Government is practically unable to enforce its orders in them even if it gives any. Lastly, His Excellency the Governor furnished the best evidence of his opinion about the right thing to do by absolutely segregating himself and his staff in the fort on the south side of the river. He stopped the ferry and so cut off all intercourse with his capital (Little Damaun) and the rest of his territory, receiving complaints and issuing orders by post only. 8. Fortunately there was to hand an admirable agency for pro- tecting British territory in the persons of the Salt Preventive Force usually employed on the frontier to prevent smuggling. It was under the command of Mr. Judge, Assistant Collector of Salt Revenue, a most useful and reliable officer, well supported by Messrs. Dart and Smyth and later by Mr. Shepherd, all Inspectors of Salt Revenue. A sketch of the frontier is appended in which the red line shows the cordon as it is ordinarily maintained for salt and customs preventive purposes. For the sake of simplicity and economy it is straightened so as to leave outside two corners of British territory. As all British subjects were entitled to protection at such a time as this if it were possible to give it, the cordon was transferred to the real frontier (the blue line) to provide for the greater length of which the guard was increased by 60 men-from 260 to 320. 9. The plague preventive line was first established on the 30th March. At first the stoppage of communication was too absolute, but this was a fault on the right side. The mortality in Damaun was steadily increasing. The operations of the Portuguese Government against it were left to a force of one Jemadar of Police and 18 men. They substituted ashes as a disinfectant for lime. The Government charged a fee of 14 annas for registration of a death, but they took a bribe of 4 annas for allowing non-registration. Partly through corruption and partly through feebleness they allowed all classes to snap their fingers at the orders to segregate and disinfect. Conse- quently the hospitals remained practically empty while the people died in hundreds in their houses. The Musalmans would not even
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 83 let the so-called "Sanitary Officer" walk about the town. The fol- lowing is written by Mr. Judge from personal observation:- "The plague being left unchecked worked frightful ravages in the town, whole families were swept away, people died in the fields and were devoured by vultures, or on the sea shore, and were washed away to sea or in their houses and were left to rot there. Some were attacked with plague and no traces of them can now be found, robbery and arson became common, houses were looted without check, sheds burnt down, money lenders refused to trade and shop- keepers closed their shops. The people were in despair. On one occasion a gang of 1,000 men tried to force the cordon, but being firmly met by Mr. Smyth, an officer under me, with a body of armed men, and tactfully treated, they returned to Damaun for the purpose of seizing the ferry and attacking the Governor in his fort, to whose imbecility they attributed their misfortunes, and it was with the greatest difficulty that some leading men persuaded and cajoled them to abandon their designs. While these horrors were being enacted in Damaun the Governor and his staff, protected by all the available troops, remained inert and panicstricken in the Fort and never once put foot in Lower Damaun. "Out of a population of about 8,000 souls, about 2,600 have been swept away up to the present." 10. The cordon arrangements have been much modified since the beginning, but they have now for some time been in force as fol- lows:- (1) All Portuguese subjects are allowed to pass into Damaun without question, and also all others who have reasonable cause for going there. All are warned that they run the risk for having to remain under observation on their return, and this is an effectual check. The only classes who are prevented from entering Damaun territory are the British villagers who want to go to drink on the cheap and then return home. It would be madness to allow them to go to and fro, and they are peremptorily told they must stay at home during the present danger. They quite acquiesce in the reasonableness of this. (2) All persons not suspected, such as persons from Big Damaun where the Governor's Fort stands, are allowed to pass out of Damaun territory after medical examina- tion, but all who come from Little Damaun and neigh- bouring villages are treated as prim facie suspicious,
84 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. Considering what a fostering sink of plague this area is, no other presumption is possible. For all suspicious persons comfortable residential sheds have been provided on the road as marked on the sketch map. They are provided with a provision shop, good well water, and isolated hospital for cases of sickness. Their clothes and kit are divided into two heaps-one to be burnt or sent back at the option of the owner, and the other to be disinfected by boiling. After selecting a suit of clothes that has been boiled and dried, the owner goes to a healthy shed and after taking a disinfecting bath he puts on the clean clothes and throws those he was wearing over the fence, whence they are taken up and boiled. He remains for 10 days under observation and is then allowed to go if found to be healthy. The Commissioner, on paying a surprise visit recently to the camp, found the inmates most cheerful and happy. No complaints were made. This is also the testimony of the Collector. There was ample accommodation for those who had come up to date. At the moment there were about 75 in residence. To provide for a larger afflux at the beginning of the rains, preparation was ordered to be made for another shed. (3) On the passage of goods there is absolutely no embargo. Passes have been granted to 12 agents selected by Mr. Judge and the Governor of Damaun who are allowed to take delivery of parcels at the railway stations and bring them into Damaun. The only limitation on goods of any kind is that at the two frontier stations of Chola and Patherpunja they must change carts and cartmen. The Commissioner can certify the arrangements to be simple and effective. They are necessary to prevent infected carts and drivers from passing into British territory. As inspection is possible at only two nakas the traffic is limited to the two routes, but this causes no inconvenience at all, for under the Land Customs Act these are the only two roads open in ordinary times, 11. Finally the Commissioner begs to submit that- (1) Whatever precaution is taken, it cannot be enforced over 38 miles of open country without a cordon. Hence a cordon is absolutely necessary unless plague is again to be let loose. (2) Passage from Damaun through the cordon is only allowed to suspected persons on one route. To establish
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 85 observation camps at other points would involve more ex- pense and would be less acceptable to the people because the supervision would be less efficient. The one route through Chola can be easily used by the whole of Damaun, and Mr. Judge and his assistants are able to permanently stay there and look after things. (3) Government may supply a Commissioned Medical Officer, but the advantage will not be obvious. The present medical officer knows his work and he acts with the immediate personal assistance of Mr. Judge. This sup- plies all the guarantee which would be afforded by a Commissioned Medical Officer and is less expensive. The Commissioner's own opinion is that the presence of Mr. Judge who has had many years' experience and more- over holds command of the salt sepoys is far more valu- able than that of a young doctor new to the country. Supersession too would be a poor return for his excellent work. (4) It has been explained above that only those are detained who are reasonably regarded as "suspicious," that the camp of observation is quite large enough at present, and further provision is being made for possible further needs; and that no restriction exists on the transport of goods except what is in practice a slight precaution against the spread of infection.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 76o-P., dated the 17th June, on the subject of the measures taken on the Damaun frontier to prevent the spread of plague. 2. I am to say that the Government of India are glad to learn that the originally stringent measures which were imposed against Damaun have been relaxed, and that they consider that the existing arrange- ments reported in your letter and enclosure are not open to objection. In particular I am to say that, as the Government of Bombay are satisfied with the medical arrangements at the inspecting station, the Government of India do not desire to press for any change in this respect. 3. I am, however, to remark that the present information is not in all respects complete. It does not show, for instance, when the
86 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. relaxations and improved arrangements were introduced, nor how many persons are allowed to pass without detention, nor does it answer the question contained in my telegram of the 26th May asking for how many persons accommodation has actually been provided in the obser- vation camp. The Government of India consider that the Commis- sioner of the Northern Division should have furnished full information on these points in order that they and the Government of Bombay might be in the best position to judge how the arrangements are working. 4. The Government of India will also be glad to know that assur- ance the Government of Bombay have that the guard of 320 men, of whom not more than 150 could be on duty at the same time, have effectively guarded a frontier of 38 miles, and how the British vil- lagers assisted in rendering the guard effective. 5. In conclusion I am to forward, for disposal, under the orders of the Governor in Council, a petition* from Ardeshir Sorabjee, Post Walla, purporting to be on behalf of the inhabitants of Lower Damaun, complaining against the arrangement on the frontier. No. 44. No. 1816, dated Simla, the 13th July 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. I am directed to refer to your letter No. 759-P., dated the 17th June, forwarding, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a Memorandum by the Commissioner of the Northern Division relative to the danger of British territory being infected with plague from Damaun. 2. The Commissioner suggests that the Portuguese authorities should be asked to select a strong executive officer and to give him powers to disinfect the houses in order to prevent a revival of the pestilence. He considers that unless the Portuguese authorities can be induced to take this step, Damaun will probably remain a source of plague infection for years. 3. The Government of India agree that it is very desirable that steps should be taken to thoroughly clean and disinfect Damaun, and that unless this be done there will be danger of a recrudescence of the disease in Damaun spreading infection over the border. They will therefore be glad if the Government of Bombay will address the Governor General of Portuguese India on the subject and will endeavour to persuade him to cause the necessary measures to be thoroughly carried out. * Not printed.

In reply to the questions put in the Government of India's letter No. 1788* of 7th instant, forwarded under your No. 998-P. of 18th idem, I have the honour to report as follows. 2. It is difficult to give the exact dates of the introduction of the various relaxations and improvements in the preventive measures against Damaun, as they were made from time to time as experience warranted. The whole of the present system, as described in my No. 212 of 11th June, was established before the date of the Govern- ment of India's telegram of 26th May. 3. Freedom to bon fide Portuguese subjects to enter Damaun was allowed almost from the first, but the Commissioner's first written order to that effect is dated 21st April. The camp of observation was established on 9th May under my letter to the District Magistrate, dated 21st and 27th April, which set forth the instructions of the Government of India. The free passage of goods coming by rail sub- ject to the one condition mentioned in my report was ordered in my letter of 21st April to the District Magistrate. Agents to take delivery of goods, and the passage of cattle were appointed on 3rd May and preceding dates. On the 30th April intimation was person- ally given by Mr. Judge to the Governor of Damaun (1) that goods from the railway, and also grain, grass and fuel would have free pass- age subject to the one condition of change of cart and driver on the frontier, (2) that persons coming from the infected town of Damaun would be regarded as prim facie suspicious, but would be given ample opportunity of proving themselves free from infection, and would, in case of their doing so, be allowed to pass. 4. The number of persons allowed to pass out of Damaun, without detention, is approximately 400 up to date.
88 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. 5. As to the extent of accommodation provided, I was under the impression that the 10th paragraph of my report gave as accurate information as was possible in stating that there was ample room for those who had come, up to date, and that the number was then about 75. As the people, from choice, live together in family or caste groups and as much as they can in the open air, it is not possible to state its capacity in definite figures. The average number of inmates for the last three weeks for which I have received reports are 86, 34, 51, and for these there is ample room. Since my last visit the accommoda- tion has been increased, and is now calculated to be sufficient for 100. 6. With regard to the questions asked in paragraph 4 of the Gov- ernment of India's letter, I have the honour to quote the following from Mr. Judge's recent report:- "Along the whole 38 miles to be guarded, a path, about 10 feet wide, was demarcated by boulders and clods of earth, and the path roughly cleared and made practicable for patrolling by night and day. Along this path there are 39 chowkeys taken into use (including 17 new ones), thus giving chowkeys about one mile equidistant from one another. The men off duty were not allowed to leave the chow- keys, excepting with leave from their Amaldar, and, as the chowkeys are in most cases visible from one another, this ensured a guard visible to each other in the day. At every mile two sentries were put on duty between each chowkey during the day, and consequently with the men off duty at the chowkeys at every 552 yards there was a man on watch during the day. The whole force went on duty at night. Advantage was taken of the conformation of the territorial frontier and the existence of two tidal rivers to decrease sentries in one direc- tion and increase them in another, and along the principal part to be guarded, I was enabled to place eight men per mile and in the other about six men per mile at night and half these men went on sentry-go, while the other half went to sleep on the line at places selected by myself and equidistant from one another. By these means at approxi- mately every 1/4 of a mile there was a man asleep and likely to be awakened by persons or vehicles passing, and in the 440 yards between each sleeper there was a sentry patrolling. Where roads bisected the cordon, modifications were made by placing a chowkey or sentry post, etc., to guard them. At every other chowkey there was an Amaldar placed whose duty it was to see that the men went on duty during the day, and twice every night he had to patrol over his sub-division of two miles called Naik's beat and see the sentries were alert. The line was again divided into four divisions called Jamadar's patrol and each division place
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 89 under a Jamadar (three Jamadars and one senior Havildar being utilized) who had to see that orders were carried out, occasionally visit the line, and once in every 24 hours either by day or by night at irregular hours go over the whole of their division. The line was again divided in two major divisions and placed under the Inspec- tors who had to visit their respective beats on four nights and two days during each week and at such irregular hours as they deemed fit. The Inspectors, each, also had a small detective party under an Amaldar who could be utilized by being sent out to pay surprise visits along the line, or should any particular sentry or beat come under suspicion could be sent out quietly to watch behind the said sentry or beat, and arrest any one improperly let through. As such an arrest would lead to the dismissal of the offending sentry, and possibly to his prosecution, no sentry was safe if he attempted to accept a bribe. * * * * * * * You will thus see that the line being strongly guarded by sentries, about 1 to 1/4 of a mile, constantly patrolled by Amaldars, and regularly visited by the supervising staff, it was absolutely impossible for per- sons to get across during the day unperceived and next to impossible for them to do so at night. Now as all the roads were guarded, and as ordinary passengers would not be able to find their way over the fields at night and when in addition to finding their way, they would have had to evade a strongly guarded cordon, it will be seen that the task of crossing the cordon was, for ordinary persons, rendered impossible at night also even for healthy persons. About 40 persons who attempted to evade the cordon at various times were detained and prosecuted and convicted. The villagers assisted in making the patrol path and erected the "Kacha " mandwas required on moving the line forward to the terri- torial frontier. No persons have been arrested as having evaded the cordon by villagers, but the patels, etc., were put on the watch for them and would have done so had the necessity arisen, as they and their villa- gers, after they realized the danger from contagion or infection, became extremely keen on keeping their villages " free from strangers." The best proof of the efficiency of the cordon and the co-operation of the villagers is the immunity of the Pardi Taluka, and especially the frontier British villages when compared with the 3,000 cases of plague that have occurred within the Damaun territory. c 12

With reference to your letter No. 4 of the 5th instant, I have the honour to enclose a note which I have made showing the preliminary requirements for isolation and quarantine sheds. The contents of this note might, I think, be communicated to the authorities concerned in the case of Rewari and Bhatinda. Suggestions for Hospital sheds. I think that the hospital sheds might be 18 feet by 6 feet, with side walls 8 feet high, and a sloping roof, the centre pole of which would rise say 6 feet above the wall. This would accommodate 4 patients, giving over 600 cubic feet of space to each. I would have a doorway 6  4 feet provided with a mat door in each side wall and an opening about 2 feet square, with a mat shutter at each end, placed about 5 feet from the ground. Taking each bed as 6  4 feet, there would be 4 feet between the beds, while each would be 2 feet from the wall, and a central pas- sage 6 feet wide would be provided between the feet of the beds.
APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 91 These rough sketches show the general idea and how the beds would be placed. The walls should be of reeds or thatch, not mud. Such walls allow perflation of air, and with sufficient bedding would not be too cold. * A moveable screen of thatch, 6 feet by 5, should be kept in readiness, so that if a female patient were admitted, privacy could be effected. * An observation shed for two beds should be also provided, say 18 feet by 8, with but one door. A hut of similar construction about 12 feet square would be needed for the Hospital Assistant.  A small thatch-work enclosure, without a roof, and about the size of an ordinary 'necessary' hut, should be placed a few yards from the hospital sheds.  At first two beds in the hospital shed and one in the observation ward need only be equipped. For each bed 2 pairs of sheets, 3 country blankets, 1 mattress and I pillow each filled with straw would suffice. For European patients, a tent would be most suitable, in which a newar cot with a durrie, a rezai, 4 sheets, 2 pillow covers, 3 blankets and 2 cotton pillows would be at first necessary, also a chair, a com- mode, urinal, and 'necessary' tent.

92 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. found by inspecting Medical Officers at Khanpur, Sher Shah, Raewind, Rewari or Bhatinda to have symptoms of bubonic plague:-The Com- missioned Medical Officers who will be stationed at Khanpur and Rewari will exercise their discretion in determining whether any such person shall be detained or sent on to the next Civil Surgeon. Much will depend on the facility of obtaining proper food, nursing, etc. The Motamid of the Bahawalpur State has been requested to arrange at once for a tent and necessary furniture, cooking utensils, etc. at Khanpur, and a copy of the note of requirements forwarded with your letter No. 34, dated 7th January 1897, will be sent to His Highness the Nawab of Bahawalpur and to the Commissioner of Delhi. 2. The Hospital Assistants at the three other inspecting stations will not be authorized to detain European or Eurasian passengers. Such persons if suspected to be suffering from plague should in His Honour's opinion be carried on in the train to the nearest Civil Sur- geon, their fellow-passengers being dealt with in accordance with Railway rules on the subject. On arrival at the nearest civil station the European or Eurasian plague patient should be taken to an isolation hospital and treated by the Civil Surgeon, who would be prepared for his arrival by a wire from the Hospital Assistant. 3. The nearest civil stations will be:- (1) In the case of Khanpur and Sher Shah: Mooltan. It is understood that you wrote some time ago to the Civil Sur- geon to arrange for an isolation hospital there. (2) In the case of Raewind: Lahore. Here also it is understood that arrangements for an isolation hospital are being made. (3) In the case of Rewari: Gurgaon. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Commissioner, Delhi, who will be asked to arrange in consultation with you for an isolation hos- pital there. (4) In the case of Bhatinda: Ferozepore. The Commissioner, Jullundur, will be similarly addressed, but I am to ask you to consider whether in this instance it might not be prefer- able to arrange for the patient to be sent back to Hissar. 4. You have been asked to communicate direct with the Agent, Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. I am to suggest that you should inform him of the contents of this letter. 5. I am to enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Manager, North-Western Railway, No. 30-C., dated 6th January 1897, intimating the instructions issued by him for the examination of passengers from Karachi and Sukkur.

In respect of regulations under section 2, sub- section 2 (b), regarding inspection of travel- lers by railway, Governor General in Council desires to make the following remarks for consideration of Local Government. It is essential that medical inspection of passengers in trains coming from direction of infected districts shall be complete and this can only be effected by removal of passengers to platform and individual inspec- tion there by medical officer. The regulations should provide for this.   The    Governor    General in   Council considers that, subject to   opinion  of   Local Government,    such    inspection    might  take place at following places:- Madras.-Perambur and Guntakal, to each of which places a Commissioned Medical Officer should be appointed. Appointment of these officers need not interfere with subsidiary inspections reported in your telegram of 2nd instant. Bombay.-Kaliyan, Anand, Hubli, Karachi, Bhusawal and at some place on Bombay-Baroda line not far from Bombay, possibly Palghar. * Reprinted in Appendix IV.

It seems to the Government of India that inspection now perform- ed at Sukkur by Assistant Surgeon might more usefully be performed at Ruk. Central Provinces.-Itarsi and Bilaspur. The Government of India think that Commissioned Medical Officer should be appointed to former place and will place one at your disposal, if you are unable to appoint one. The work at Bilaspur should be done by Civil Sur- geon. North-Western Provinces and Oudh.-Naini and Jhansi. A European Military Assistant Surgeon should be appointed to Naini and a Commissioned Medical Officer at Jhansi. Government of India will provide men if North-Western Provinces Government is unable to do so. These arrangements need not supersede any subsidiary inspections of less complete character ordered by North-Western Provinces Government at other stations. Punjab.-Government of India think that Commissioned Officer now at Khanpur should be removed to Raewind, and the one at Rewari to Bandikui. Also that hospital assistant at Sher Shah should be moved to Mahmud Kot as more suitable place.

The Governor General in Council does not at present  propose to issue any regulations under section 2, and intends  that   Local Governments should issue them where they are required.    I am, how- ever, to say with reference to section 2, sub-section (2)  (b), that   His Excellency in Council is of opinion that it is essential that the medical inspection  of passengers  in   trains   coming  from  the  direction   of infected  districts should  be   complete and   that  this can   only be effected by the removal of the passengers to the platform and indi- vidual inspection there by the medical officer.    For this purpose  the Governor General in  Council thinks that a Commissioned Medical officer should be appointed at Assansole, and I am to ask that, if   His Honour  the   Lieutenant-Governor   has   no objection,  this  may  be arranged for.   The special inspection at Assansole need not interfere with any subsidiary inspections of a less complete character at other places which the Lieutenant-Governor may prescribe.    The  Govern- ment of India think that it would be undesirable to construct an  isola- tion hospital at Assansole where there is a large community connected with the railway, but a small hospital for suspected cases, and separate huts for the accommodation of persons suffering from plague, should be provided at same place in the neighbourhood to be approved by the Lieutenant-Governor. 3.  I am to suggest for His Honour's consideration whether it may not be desirable to give assistance to the Port Health  Officer in   the conduct of his duties at the present juncture,  either   by  associating with him the Protector of Emigrants or in some other manner.

Letter from the Chairman, Bombay Plague Committee, No. 3798, dated the 8th June 1897:- "The exodus from Cutch Mandvi to Bombay which, until recently, was all by boat will, when the rains set in, it is anticipated, be by way of Wawania to Mandvi and thence to Bombay by rail. Owing to the fact that it is not possible to so carefully examine passengers by rail as by sea, it is feared, that the exodus may be a serious menace to Bombay during the rains. "2. I beg, therefore, to suggest to Government that a quarantine camp be established at Ahmedabad. At this camp all passengers from west of Wadhwan should be detained eight days as is now done in Bombay for all Cutch Mandvi people arriving by steamer. The camp should be capable of holding at least 500 people, might be constructed of bamboos, jowlis and mats, as has been done in Bombay. " 3.

Demi-official letter from the Chairman, Bombay Plague Committee, dated the 16th June 1897, to the Private Secretary  to   His  Excellency   the Governor:- " Your letter of 11th June, with accompaniment (telegram of 5th June, we have carefully considered the matter, and we look at it in this way. " 1. Quarantine can be imposed if a ship has touched at an infected port or is itself infected. "2. The vessels which now bring Cutch Mandvi people do touch at Salaya,. which is itself a heavily infected port, and it was to stop that traffic that the quarantine rules against vessels were proposed. During the rains no Cutch Mandvi people can arrive by sea in any Karachi vessels except the ones that call at Salaya, as steamers will not put in at any Cutch or Kathiawr ports except Salaya, and even that port is a dangerous one in the south-west monsoon. Therefore there need be no quarantine against Karachi vessels unless they touch at Salaya. "3. As, however, Shepherd and Company have now decided only to run one steamer a fortnight from Karachi vi Salaya; and as the Venice Conference Rules apparently do not, even in the case of vessels less than ten days out from infected port, contemplate strict quarantine against the vessel itself, we think that our proposal to quarantine vessels from ports between Karachi and Diu may, for the present, be shelved, and passengers from such ports be treated as now, i.e., segregation in camp on shore, and vessels given pratique after disembarkation of the passengers. The fact also that vessels conveying infected people and cargo should not be treated more severely than trains under similar circumstances should be taken into consideration. "4. It should, however, be remembered that after the cessation of the rains free communication will again take place between Bombay and all Cutch and Kathiawar ports, and it would be well if rules were drawn

The above, I think, will meet the case and keep us prepared for any emergency." Letter to the Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Abkari, No. p--86o-P., dated the 1st July 1897 :- " I am directed to forward the accompanying copy of a letter from the Chairman, Bombay Plague Committee, dated 16th instant, on the subject of the protection of the port of Bombay from plague infection from Cutch ports and to request that the necessary rules may be drawn up, in consultation with such officers as you may deem neces- sary, as suggested in the concluding portion of the Chairman's letter." "Memoranda to the Chairman, Bombay Plague Committee, the Commis- sioner, N. D., and the Collector of Ahmedabad, No. P. -902-P., dated the 7th July 1897 :- Forwards, for information, the following copy of a memorandum of the measures for protecting the Kathiawar State from plague infection from Cutch : - "In view of the recent virulent outbreak of plague in the Native State of Cutch, it has been necessary to take special precautionary steps to prevent the introduction of plague into other parts of the Presidency. At the commencement of the outbreak the principal danger lay in the infection being carried by passengers leaving Cutch ports by steamer or craft, and measures were accordingly adopted to detain under observation all persons arriving at Bombay, Karachi, and other ports in the Bombay Presidency, who might, in the opinion of the local Plague Authorities, be considered 'suspicious.' It has also, however, been found necessary to consider the means that should be adopted for watching and regulating the traffic from Cutch into Kathiawar by the following routes, which were available :-  Cutch Side.

Letter from the Chairman, Bombay Plague Committee, No. 4922, dated the 29th July 1897:- " In reply to your letter No. P.-1064-P., dated 27th July 1897, I have the honour to report that, on receipt of your telegram No. M.-214-P., of 20th April, I communicated with the Commissioner of Customs, the Chairman, Port Trusts, and the Port Health Officer regarding the steps to be taken for quarantining vessels from Cutch Mandvi; and I beg to attach a copy of the Rules which were then drawn up." RESOLUTION.-These papers may now be recorded. 2. The Chairman of the Bombay Plague Committee should be informed, with reference to Rule 4 of the rules forwarded with his letter No. 4922, dated 20th July 1897, that Government rely on him to submit, in good time, for approval, the rules for quarantine against Cutch which he has proposed to draw up and hold in readiness for future contingencies. NOTE OF INSPECTION BY SURGEON-MAJOR-GENERAL WARBURTON, OFFICIATING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE. No. 52. No. 331, dated 4/6th April 1897. I beg to submit the following note on my recent visits to first class plague inspection stations. 1. Khana.-I arrived at 5-11 P.M. and left at 6-20 P.M. on 24th March. Surgeon-Captain Dyson, Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, and Surgeon-Captains Calvert and Jay-Gould, and Surgeon-Lieutenant Peck, the three officers posted here for inspection duty, met me at the station and showed me over the segregation camp, a very accurate
?APP.

The distribution of water by pipes and more efficient steam- ing arrangements will shortly be completed. There had been 364 admissions to date and there were 22 suspects in the camp at the time of my visit, two of whom were in hospital, one suffering from pneumonia and the other from chicken-pox. I saw the passengers in the 6-20 P.M. train inspected and was satisfied with the thoroughness of the inspection. Seven first and second class and 363 third class passengers were examined. No complaints were made. So far no cases of plague have been discovered. The lowest number of passengers inspected on any one day was 1,799 and the highest 4,067. The lighting arrangements were defective, but electric light will soon  be  in   operation  at  a special   inspection   platform which was nearly completed and at which only trains from up-country will stop. 2.  Manikpur.-I reached this station at 6 P.M. on the  25th   and remained there till 9-14 the next morning. Only two trains from the Bombay direction-one at 7-24 A.M. and the other at 7-5 P.M -are examined each day. There are no night trains. I was present at the inspection of two trains, the total number of passengers examined being 360, of whom about 15 per cent. were from the Bombay Presidency. The examining staff consists of one Commissioned Medical Officer, Surgeon-Lieutenant Dawes, and a native female nurse ; the former examines all the men and feels the pulses of the females, whose examination is completed by the nurse. The examinations were carefully made. There were no purdah women and no complaints. One hospital assistant is in charge of the segregation camp and is present at inspections to take over any suspects or plague cases that may have to be detained. The camp consists of tents and huts for Europeans and natives with hospital properly isolated, but as only two suspects had so far been detained, the hospital assistant has had little to do. The small number of " suspects " at this station is probably due to effective inspections at Jubbulpur and Itarsi. The drinking water is here the great difficulty. Europeans get theirs from Allahabad and natives use water from the railway well and a neighbouring tank, both of which are drying up. The station is badly lighted. The medical officer keeps no diary. I have directed him to do so, entering the number of passengers examined each day, especially c  14

The staff is sufficient and no new passenger is allowed to enter the train till the inspection is completed. 3. Itarsi.-Surgeon-Colonel Hutcheson, Sanitary Commissioner, Central Provinces, joined me at Jubbulpur, where I learned there is a platform inspection of all passengers from the Bombay direction, conducted by a Native Assistant Surgeon and hospital assistant, but I did not consider it necessary to remain and see how it was done. We reached Itarsi at 6-45 A.M. on 27th and left again at 9-40 A.M. The staff here consists of a Commissioned Medical Officer, Surgeon-Captain Bourke, a female hospital assistant for examining passengers, a Native Assistant Surgeon and Hospital Assistant for camp and other duties. Hospital and segregation arrangements for Europeans and natives are sufficient, except that a hospital for women is required, and the camp is well situated and water-supply satisfac- tory. There is an incinerator for the destruction of excreta and other infected substances. There are no means of disinfecting clothing or bedding except by boiling, but so far suspected articles of this kind have been burned. I have suggested that some clothing and bedding should be kept in stock to replace any destroyed. There were 10 men and 3 women suspects in camp, and since 17th February, when Dr. Bourke assumed charge, 49 have been detained ; none of these have developed into plague cases, though a plague case, which proved fatal, was taken out of the train on February 16th. Before that 10 cr 12 cases are said to have occurred, but the information is not reliable and there are no records. Three trains are examined here daily, at 8-10 A.M., 4-35 P.M. and 9-49 P.M , so that there is no night duty. Dr. Bourke calculates that about 500 passengers are examined daily. I saw the examina- tion of the 8-10 train in which were 121 passengers and was satisfied with it. I also examined on my return on 30th in the 4-35 P.M. train. On this occasion the carriages had not been locked at the last stop- ping place, and passengers were able to get out before examination. I drew attention to this. I discovered at this station that passenger carriages are attached to goods trains on various railway lines and not being scheduled the presengers thus conveyed are likely to evade inspection. 4. Bhusawal was reached at 5-3 P.M. on 27th and I remained there till 9-35 P.M.

About 700 passengers are examined each day. The staff consists of one Commissioned Medical Officer, two Military Assistant Surgeons and five hospital assistants, and I found hospital assistants assisting at the inspections. I saw the two evening trains examined. The inspections were carefully performed. I also visited the segregation camp, where there was accommoda- tion for 20 plague cases and 5 suspects. There were 2 suspects under observation and three cases recovering from plague under treatment: 11 other cases of plague, making 14 in all, of whom 7 had died and 4 had been discharged cured. The water-supply was said to be satisfactory, but the roofs of the huts were too thin to be a protection against the sun. This was about to be remedied. The staff I considered unnecessarily large, but I learned afterwards at Kalyan that the Commissioned Medical Officer and two hospital assistants were under orders for transfer. One of the remaining hos- pital assistants might with advantage be replaced by a female hospital assistant as there is none here. I was examined here on the 30th in the 9-16 A.M. train. The examination appeared sufficient. 5.  Nagpur.-We arrived here at 8 A.M. and left at 7-20 P.M.  on the 28th.    Three trains are examined here daily, at 8 A.M., 4-30   P.M. and 10 P.M. and from 400 to 500 passengers inspected. The staff consists of a Commissioned Medical Officer, Surgeon- Lieutenant Hammond, a Native Assistant Surgeon, female hospital Assistant, and an hospital assistant. I saw the examination of the train in which we arrived and was satisfied with it. I also visited the segregation camp which had been opened on 15th February with accommodation for 24 men and 8 women. At the time of my visit there were six cases under observation with four dependants. One case in hospital suspected to be plague but diagnosis not confirmed. Before the opening of the camp there had been two cases of plague with one death and one recovery, but no cases had occurred since. There is a good water-supply and the huts suitable and well situ- ated. 6.  Kalyan.-As I found I had a day to spare, I decided  to  visit Kalyan and wired accordingly to the Surgeon-General with the Bom- bay Government.    I arrived there at  6 P.M. and left again at   11-40 P.M. on the 29th.
?108                        Measures  to prevent the                  [ APP. VIII. I was by the courtesy of the Surgeon-General, to whom my thanks are due, met by Surgeon-Major Street, D.S.O., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, and Surgeon-Captain Prall, Acting Secretary to the Surgeon-General, also by the two commissioned Inspecting Medical Officers, Surgeon-Lieutenants Walton and Dixon, and shown over the segregation camp. The morning report showed that there were 15 persons in the observation sheds and 19 cases in the plague sheds. From 13th February to 29th March 301 passengers have been de- tained. Of these 250 were suspects. About 98 appear to have been plague cases with 63 deaths, 16 discharged cured and 19 remaining under treatment. The above figures are, perhaps, not quite accurate as some deaths from other causes appear to have been mixed up with those from plague. Twenty scheduled trains have to be examined daily, but I could not find out the mumber of passengers inspected. The staff consists of two Commissioned Medical Officers, two Military Assistant Surgeons and nine hospital assistants, besides six sepoy attendants. There are 11 policemen in charge of the camp. An additional Commissioned Medical Officer is under orders to join, as the inspection work here is necessarily very hard and trying. I was present at the examination of three trains and found them carefully and properly conducted. The camp is on ground which will become a swamp in the rains and I am told that the only suitable position in the neighbourhood is the military encamping-ground. Efforts are being made to arrange for proper disinfecting apparatus. The water-supply from a well is said to be good. I learned here that another first class inspection station is about to be started at Manmad, the junction of the Dhond and Manmad Railway. There is, I understand, ample room for a large segregation camp here, and should it be found necessary to detain all passengers from Bombay, this would be a suitable place for such detention. 7. Jhansi.-I arrived here at 2-55 A.M. and left before 4 A.M. on 31st, and I saw Surgeon-Lieutenant Robertson make a very thorough inspection of the passengers in my train. Five trains are inspected here daily-At 1-45 A.M. and 2-45 A.M. from Bombay, 3 A.M. and 12 noon from the Gwalior direction and 9-30 A.M. from Manikpur. Dr. Robertson has been here since February 8th. The arrangements made for preventing passengers booking at Jhansi from entering the train before the inspection is completed are

No plague cases have reached so far south as Mysore, and action up to date has been practically confined to inspection work in the Mysore State. No special staff has been detailed for plague duty, the idea being that the officials carrying on the inspection work could afford relief in an emergency until the occurrences of fresh cases rendered it necessary to organise a complete hospital staff. There are inspection stations at Harihar and Yaswant- pur outside Bangalore on the Southern Mahratta Railway. At each of these places, where all trains from the north are examined, there are a hospital assistant, midwife, cook, bhisty, and ward cooly, and sheds to accommodate six patients. There are also sheds at four other stations on this railway, which are in charge of the Hospital Assistant of the adjoining dispensary should cases occur. The necessary staff, male and female, could be at once either sent from Bangalore by train or taken from dispensaries in the neighbour- hood should the necessity arise. The Senior Surgeon, Mysore State, is fully alive to the desirability of having female attendants for women sufferers. In most cases, however, the only attendants available would be Hospital Assistants for men and midwives or females on the vaccinating establishment for women. At Bangalore Cantonment the inspection arrangements are in charge of the Residency Surgeon; he is assisted by the Municipality male and female medical subordinates. Here also our endeavours are entirely protective. Temporary sheds have been provided for plague cases, and the necessary hospital establishment of male and female attendants could be provided at two hours' notice. The inspection arrangements are, I believe, thorough and all Medical Officers agree that they comprise all that is necessary. At present all local notifications under the Epidemic Diseases Act have been adopted by the Mysore Durbar, and district officials have ample powers thereunder to deal with any outbreak of plague in the interior of the State.

NOTE BY SURGEON-CAPTAIN DYSON, SANITARY COM- MISSIONER OF BENGAL, ON THE ARRANGEMENTS AT THE PLAGUE OBSERVATION CAMP AT KHANA JUNC- TION ON THE EAST INDIAN RAILWAY. No. 68. Dated the 12th March 1897. The accompanying plan of the quarantine encampment will ex- plain how it has been laid out. It will be seen that it is divided into three portions, vis., (1) the plague hospital; (2) the contact camp; and (3) the suspect camp. The plague camp consists of- (a) two structures, 45' x  16",  which   are   the   native   plague hospitals. (b) six rooms, 10' x  10", for the families of the patients, and (c) eight rooms, 8' x  10", for the hospital attendants. There  is also a small pucka  house   for   European   cases, and accommodation for mehters and domes with a  separate clear water tank for their use. A Horbury's iron latrine is provided, also Larymore's stool in- cinerator, and there is a pure water-supply from iron tanks. The water for these tanks is obtained from a pucka well, carefully covered in, by a lift and force pump, and is thence distributed to the tanks by iron pipes. Each tank is fitted with a brass turncock, and provided with a wash-out plug for purpose of cleaning and disinfection and a
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 119 covered-in manhole. There is accommodation for 40 plague cases. The beds are of iron, and thus can be quickly disinfected with a paraffin torch. Thalas and battis made of iron (Jail pattern) have been supplied for feeding purposes, as they also can be quickly disin- fected by heat. In the contact camp there are 75 huts (68 completed to date) 10' x 8, for two persons. There is thus accommodation for 150 persons. This camp also is provided with a Horbury's latrine and an iron tank for water-supply. It is surrounded by barbed wire fencing. The suspect camp-75 huts, 10' x 8x, at two persons per hut- provides accommodation for 150 persons. The camp is provided with a Horbury's latrine, and a pucka well is being rapidly constructed. The camp is surrounded with a barbed wire fencing. Quarters for the Hospital Assistants and other officers are in course of construction, A new shop for the bunniah is being built between the suspect and contact camps. All the huts in the contact and suspect camps are numbered for convenience of registration. Inspection.-The inspection staff consists of two medical officers of the Indian Medical Service and two lady doctors. One medical officer and one lady doctor are on duty together. Owing to the number of trains passing through at night, no arrange- ment can give more than one night in bed out of every two. Hence the duty is very severe, and the inspecting staff will have to be in- creased, or a breakdown may be expected. Daily roster.-The following table will show how the 24 hours are divided into watches so as to give each inspecting officer one night's rest out of two :- Daily roster. 9th March 1897  8 A.M. to 12 noon  Dr. Culvert.

?App. VIII. ]                  sircad of infection by land.                    121 are required to alight and be examined-males by the medical officers and females by the lady doctors. A European station master, a European police sergeant, two head constables and nine constables attend each train. Of these, three constables are stationed on the up platform to see that no person gets out on the wrong side of the train. In addition there are a number of railway khalasis present to open locked compartments, assist passengers to alight, etc. If any one is contumacious and declines to submit to the examination, time is not wasted arguing with him, but he is locked in and the carriage is cut off, and put into a siding, he being liable to the railway com- pany for any loss or inconvenience they may sustain on this account. On the arrival of the train, ropes with hooks attached are fixed on to both ends of the first carriage and are held tight by the police. Male passengers are ranged in one or two rows nearest the ropes and fac- ing the train. Female passengers are ranged on the platform near the train and facing it; their backs are thus turned towards the men. It has, however, been decided to examine them in future between purdahs or kanats, so as to shield them altogether from the public gaze. Care is taken to avoid wounding their feelings in any way, and the police are not allowed to handle them at all. The police sergeant or station master having reported that the compartments are empty, inspection of each passenger and his ticket begins. Ina large number of cases their axill femoral, inguinal regions, and parotid glands are examined, and the temperature of all suspicious cases is taken. Whilst the inspection of carriage No. 1 is being made, car- riage No. 2 is emptied and the passengers prepared for inspection, and so on. After inspection passengers re-enter their compartments, women going first. No one is allowed to wander up and down the platform. Railway carriage or com- partment from which sus- pects are taken might be rapidly disinfected before being allowed to proceed. This need not take many minutes. W. P. W.,-13-3-97. Suspects from Bombay.-Passengers' tickets are examined at Asan- sole. As a result of that examination, the Sub-Inspector of Railway Police, Asansole, wires in advance to the medical officer and the Ins- pector of Police at Khana Junction the number of Bombay passengers, the class in which they are travelling, and in the case of third class passengers, the num- ber of their carriage. The tickets of third- class Bombay passengers are made over to the guard of the train, and they themselves are put in the last carriage for easy disposal. Passengers from Bombay, Poona, or other infected centres "suspected" by the medical officers are detained, and with their   baggages are   handed  over to a constable for   safe   custody  until   the   examination   of   the   train   is c 16

If the medical officer has any serious doubt about a case, he orders the carriage from which it is taken out to be cut off and im- mediately disinfected. On the departure of the train, the medical officer takes charge of the suspect's ticket, notes down the name, age, sex, caste, place of residence, and infected place from whence the "suspect" has come and the number of train from which he was removed. The station master on duty hands the Inspecting Medical Officer a slip showing the number of passengers examined (a) 1st and 2nd, (b) all other classes, (c) total. The inspection is then complete, and the train is allowed to go on. Disposal of suspects.-The "suspects" and their effects are then handed over to the European police sergeant on duty with any special instruction the medical officer may desire to give, and the latter arranges for their escort to the camp. The camp staff consists of- 1  Military Assistant Surgeon. 3 Civil Hospital Assistants and medical staff-cooks, bhistis, mehters, etc. On arrival at the camp the "suspects" are made over by the police constable to the Assistant Surgeon in charge, who tells them off to their proper camp, locates them in a numbered hut, provides them with bedding, i.e., straw, mat, or taktaposh as desired, explains the rules of the camp, and finally leaves them in charge of the Hospi- tal Assistant in charge of that particular camp. The Hospital Assist- ant examines them, takes their temperature, and is responsible that the first signs of any illness are reported, that they are present on various parades, and that their wants as regards water, food, etc., are attended to without hurting their caste prejudices. The information regarding the "suspects" noted by the Inspecting Medical Officer is made over to the camp clerk and duly entered in the "release diary" of the officer in charge of the camp, and their tickets are duly filed until their release. Camp.-The camp is under the immediate control of the Assistant Surgeon, who parades the menial servants, tells them off for duty, inspects the latrines, trenching ground, water-tanks, etc., daily super- vises the morning and evening roll-call of all quarantined persons, keeps a daily register, giving the names of all admissions, the camp and the number of the hut in which they have been placed, the date on which their clothes were disinfected, and how the suspects were finally disposed of. He also brings before the medical officer in charge each morning the persons who are to be discharged that day for a final examination by that officer, and finally hands them over

He is also in charge of all stores and equipments and their issue,   brings to the notice of the medical officer persons who   are destitute and have to be fed at Government expense.    He keeps a daily report book for the information of the medical officer in charge.    The  medical officer in charge being on inspection duty every other night and part of each day has to rely greatly on the Assistant Surgeon in   looking after the camp.     He, however, personally each morning, having  given orders the previous evening, examines all  suspects paraded   for   discharge, and, after satisfying   himself   as   to their  health,   countersigns  their railway   tickets   which   have been   filed   in the  office at the   time of admission.    Subsequently he inspects the camp in company  with the Assistant Surgeon and Hospital Assistant,   and sees   all quarantined persons, listens to complaints,  etc.,   etc.    At the   time   of his parade all suspects are summoned by a gong and stand in front of their huts. To facilitate these orders being carried out by persons unaccustomed to discipline, the bunniah's shop is closed during this parade and open again immediately after it. At present the camp contains no plague cases, and therefore also no contact cases, but it contains a number of coolies doing construc- tion work. Under the above circumstances very strict quarantine cannot be enforced. Once, however, construction is finished, the various camps can, at any moment, be strictly segregated and com- munication stopped. On completion of the new bunniah's shop between the "suspect" and "contact" camps, separate hours will be fixed for the occupants of each camp to obtain their daily supplies. With a view to keeping the camps as dry as possible, suspects are not supplied with bathing water, but are allowed to bathe in the large tank at two separate ghats, constables being stationed over each ghat to prevent any water (which is not fit for consumption) being carried away for drinking or cooking purposes. Police.-The police force on duty consists of- 1   European Inspector of the Bengal Police. 2  Sergeants of the Railway Police. 2 Constables of the Railway Police. 11  Head Constables of the Bengal Police. 72 Constables of the Bengal Police. Of these, 2 sergeants, 4 head constables, and 18 constables are employed on platform duty in two batches, 3 head constables and 24 constables are employed on sentry duty in camp, and the remainder on miscellaneous duty, on escort, arms, lines and reserve.

This suspect absconded on the 5th instant, was arrested at Dum-Dum on the 7th instant, and was back in camp in custody on the 8th instant. Statistics.-Inspection began on the 15th February, and the average daily number of passengers examined is 3,027. The total number of suspect passengers who have been detained in camp up to date is 273, and the maximum number quarantined on any one day was 135. These figures are largely due to the followers of the Gloucestershire Regiment, 71, and to two ships' crews paid off in Bombay, viz., 43 and 33 respectively. Disinfecting apparatus.-Pending the arrival of a more elaborate disinfecting apparatus, which will be ready by the end of the month the following arrangements have been made. A steam-boiler has been set up in which steam up to 50 lbs. to 100 lbs. pressure can be generated. Steam from this boiler is passed into an iron tank, in which the clothes to be disinfected are hung on iron rods. This is a "current steam" disinfector only, the tank not being made to stand pressure. The clothes are steamed for 20 minutes. Since the bacillus of plague is non-mobile, non-sporing, and is killed by expo- sure to a temperature of 60 C. for 5 minutes (Klein) or by exposure to a temperature of 80 C. (Kitasato), I believe the above procedure to be sufficient, provided too many clothes are not introduced into the tank at once. In practice it has been found that, owing to the trying nature of the work, the tank becomes very hot. The Hospital Assist- ant who has been placed in charge of the disinfection is inclined to overload it with clothes, so as to finish his work quickly and get away from the heat surrounding the engine and boiler. If the number of suspect cases should increase, we will probably have to obtain the loan of the services of a European non-commissioned officer or other European who may be trusted to implicitly carry out the orders given him, since the disinfection of clothes is important, and should be thoroughly carried out, and this under native supervision must always be a matter of doubt. I attach copies of the general rules which have been prescribed for the guidance of medical officers in charge of quarantine camps in Bengal, and also for the disinfection of infected railway carriages. General Rules to be observed by Medical Officers in charge of quar- antine Plague Camps in Bengal. 1. The camps are to be divided into three parts, vis.:- 1. The plague camp.                       2. The contact camp. 3. The suspicious camp.
?APP. VIII. ]                    spread of infection by land.                     125 2.  The   plague   camp,   as its   name   implies, should be   used as a hospital for actual cases of plague.    In the vicinity of this camp there are huts for the accommodation of relatives and attendants of the sick. 3.  In the contact camp all persons found   travelling  in   the  same railway carriage with a plague case should be segregated. 4.   In the suspicious camp all persons who appear to be   ill, but in whose cases a diagnosis cannot be arrived at   immediately, should be segregated and their symptoms carefully watched. 5.   In the event of a considerable number  of   people being segre- gated, care should be taken to  keep each day's batch  separate from the others. 6.  Quarantine will last   for  seven   days;   the   date of  departure from an infected locality should be taken   into   consideration in   this calculation. 7.  The Inspecting   Officer   will   meet all   trains from up-country and will carefully inspect all the passengers.    The railway compart- ments should be opened one by one, and the persons travelling in it should be locked in it again before examination of the next   compart- ment is made.    In this  respect, however,   the  Inspectig Officer will exercise his discretion with regard to 1st and 2nd class passengers. 8.  Rope barriers will be found useful for examination purposes. 9.  An infected carriage must  be cut off  at once and   thoroughly disinfected after the removal of the passengers to the various camps. The carriage should first be   scraped down with soap and water, and then washed over with a solution of hyd. perchloride, 1-2,000. 10. All infected clothing, bedding and articles which cannot be readily disinfected must be burnt. 11. Registers must be kept in each camp showing the date of admission, name, age and sex, daily condition, treatment and, finally the result, and a daily abstract of this should be submitted to the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal. 12.  On the death of any person   the medical  officer  will   make a careful inventory of any property he may have, and shall forward the same to the District Magistrate after thorough   disinfection,   if   there is no relative at hand.    Foul clothing should be burnt.    The   medical officer should use his discretion in this respect. 13.  The plague   excreta  should  be  carefully  disinfected   with a solution of  perchloride   of mercury,   1-2,000.    Sawdust should  be added in sufficient quantity to allow of its being burnt. 14.  Care must be taken to see that the dead are properly and com- pletely disposed of.

The medical officer should understand that   he is   responsible for all arrangements-medical as well as sanitary-and in addition to the above rules, which are only given for his   general guidance,   he should exercise his discretion in all matters not provided for here. 16.  He  should   listen   to   any   reasonable   complaints   from the people who are segregated, and do all he can  to rectify  their  griev- ances. 17.  He is also responsible and should therefore see personally to the quality of the food and water-supply for the persons detained  at the plague camps.

Proposal of Lieutenant-Governor that tickets issued from infected places should be coloured red. Government of India have carefully considered this suggestion. They fear that as soon as it became known that a red ticket marked the holder as suspected, passengers would evade the purposes of the scheme by first taking ticket to place within uninfected area and then alighting and booking again. It appears to Government of India to be undesirable to do any thing that will make passengers endeavour to hide real place of departure and evade inspection. Government of India therefore propose as alternative that all station masters should be furnished with list of infected places and that ticket collectors should be required to stop

Your telegram No. 580, Sanitary, dated 19th. Arrangements proposed place too much power in hands of ticket collectors and station masters, and persons required to give names and addresses can evade by giving false ones or going to a place other than that of address given. Effective watch could not be kept over persons in rural tracts; proposed arrangements might, however, be tried in Bri- tish India. I would suggest regulation that no person shall book from place in infected area except to place where platform inspection held at latter place, persons arriving from infected area to be quaran- tined, persons booking for inspection place not to be allowed to leave train elsewhere, names and addresses can be taken if neces- sary when booking. This would restrict traffic from infected place which is desirable. Special exemptions from regulation could be given by Government officer to European officers and persons who could be quarantined at inspection station, and quarantine might be limited to inspection stations within, say, 36 hours' journey from infected area.

In view of your suggestion we propose a rule that station masters should require all passengers coming from infected stations to give names, addresses, business which has brought them to the station and intentions regarding future movements. The infected stations might be considered for the present to be all stations in the Islands of Bombay and Salsette, also Kalyan (on account of Bhiwandi cases), Bassein, Bulsar, Rander, Kirkee, Poona and Ghor- puri. We might require a station master to send a copy of his list every day to the nearest mamlatdar who should forthwith instruct the headman of the village or the Secretary of the Municipality to watch such persons and send a report if he gets ill or departs within ten days.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 591, dated the 19th February 1897, in which the Government of India propose, with a view to keep the necessary watch on travellers by rail from infected places in order to prevent their disseminating plague, that all station masters be furnished with a list of infected places, and that ticket collectors should be required to stop all passengers presenting tickets from infected stations. Further, that such passengers should be required to give their names and addresses and such an account of themselves as will enable their future move- ments to be watched. The Government of India desire to be informed of the views of the Lieutenant-Governor on this suggestion. 2. In reply, I am directed to say that although the Lieutenant- Governor doubts whether, in practice, the system proposed will render it possible to keep any real control over persons coming from infected areas, or to follow their movements, it may tend indirectly to reduce the chances of plague spreading by deterring a number of people from travelling at all. The Lieutenant-Governor thinks that the Railway authorities should also be told to watch whether people alighting from trains remain about the station premises with a view to re-booking. No. 80.

Various methods have been under consideration for checking as far as may be practicable the spread of infection from districts affected with Bubonic Plague to other parts of India. 2. It has been suggested that, with the co-operation of the various railway administrations, arrangements might be made by Local Gov- ernments at all stations outside such districts to watch the movements of passengers arriving from infected areas, until, owing to the expiry of the period of incubation, the danger of infection had ceased. The following limits are at present pres- cribed:- Bombay to Surat. ,,    to Dhond. "    to Manmad. Poona to Alandi. Karachi           to Pipri.

The Government of India therefore desire that all passengers, from stations within the limits prescribed in the margin (or such other limits as may from time to time be communicated by the Government of India to the railway administrations concerned, shall, on arrival at stations outside the limits named and other than those at which a medical inspection of passengers is being carried out, be required by the railway station staff to furnish to the police, or other agency which the Local Administrations may designate for the purpose of giving effect to these orders, their names and addresses, and such other particulars as may be required for the maintenance of the necessary check on the proceedings and movements of such 4.

At the smaller stations it may be possible to arrange with the railway administrations that the station staff shall, in the absence of any special agency, record the names and addresses of passengers who alight holding tickets from the stations within the prescribed limits, and that the station staff shall supply information as to their number and any particulars that may seem important {such as any attempts that may be noticed to avoid detention by alighting and rebooking) to the next inspecting station or any central authority which the Local Governments may designate.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 224-R.T., dated the 6th March 1897, intimating that the names and addresses of all passengers by rail from certain areas in the Bombay Presidency and Sind should be recorded on arrival in these Provinces at places other than those at which a medical inspection of passengers is being carried out. 2.  I am to say in reply that the names   and addresses of  all  pas- sengers from the Bombay   Presidency and   Sind, who alight  at the twelve stations in these Provinces to which   medical   officers are   ap- pointed are at present being recorded in accordance with  the orders of the 26th February 1897, of which a copy is enclosed.   These orders were issued in accordance with the views of  the Home   Department, as expressed in its telegram of 20th February.    His   Honour did not propose to extend this system to other places in the Provinces partly because at such places the only person to make the record  would   be a Railway Police officer or (where  there   are   no   Railway  Police) a railway official, over whose action there would be little or  no control and partly because a system has been  organized   in these   Provinces for reporting in every village and town   the arrival   of a  person   from the Bombay Presidency or Sind.   The record at twelve stations of the names and addresses of passengers was supplementary to this system, and the experiment has not proved a success.    It is   found   that pas- sengers give false names and addresses, and that  there is   no means of detecting this at the time.      The   provision   of taking names  and addresses is so far quite useless and a mere waste of time in the vast majority of cases. 3.  For the  reasons  above stated,  the   Lieutenant-Governor  and Chief Commissioner would  prefer not   to  extend   the  system in the manner indicated in your letter under reply.

In the Lieutenant- Governor's opinion it will be sufficient to arrange that at Chapra, Dinapur, and Chakardharpore, the stations where tickets are checked, the Railway Police should take down the name, address and destination of any person holding a ticket from any one of the infected stations (a list of which is given in the letters from the Government of India, Public Works Department, quoted above), and should report these particulars to the District Superintendents of the Districts for which the passengers are bound. I am to request that you will issue orders accordingly.

DISINFECTION   OF    THE   BAGGAGE   OF   PASSENGERS TRAVELLING BY RAILWAY  FROM   PLAGUE-INFECTED AREAS. No. 90. No. 970, dated Calcutta, the 6th March 1897. From-J. P.   HEWETT,   Esq.,  C.I.E., Secretary  to the  Government  of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. I am directed to state, for the information of the Governor in Council, that the Government of India have been considering the subject of the disinfection of the luggage of passengers travelling by railway from areas in which plague prevails. Infection maybe spread as easily by the contaminated clothes and personal effects of passen- gers as by the passengers themselves, and the disinfection of suspi- cious articles is therefore a necessary adjunct to the medical inspec- tion of passengers which is made at the principal railway stations  along the lines of communication from infected districts. I am to convey the following remarks regarding the nature and extent of the disinfection which is required in order to be effective, and the manner in which it should be carried out. 4. By the Dresden  Convention of   1893, the   principles  of  which are being supported by the delegates of  Her Majesty's   Government of India at the Conference  at Venice,   disinfection   is  obligatory   for dirty linen,   rags,   clothes and   other goods  forming  part of  luggage being conveyed from a contaminated   district, provided   that the local sanitary authority considers such  articles to   be   contaminated.    The most effectual method of  disinfection   is   to   boil   the   articles  to   be disinfected in water or to subject them to   the action of   steam.    At Khana on the East Indian Railway, where special arrangements have been made for the disinfection   of  baggage,   the Government of India are informed that the steam is generated by a large engine on wheels. The steam is passed through a pipe   into a  400 gallon   water  tank, inside of which   are twelve   iron  rods  on   which   the articles   to   be disinfected are suspended.    Access   to the   interior  of  the   tank   is obtained through a manhole at the top,    The tank is provided with a safety valve and a tap for the purpose of letting  off the water which accumulates.    A cooking range is about to be added to the apparatus, and the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal hopes to have  a disinfector on the latest   approved   principles   constructed   within   three weeks. Until arrangements can be made for   disinfecting by boiling water or
?APP. VIII.]                  spread of infection by land.                        137 steam, articles of luggage can be disinfected by placing them in a solution of two parts of hydrochloric acid and one of corrosive sublimate to 1,000 parts of water for an hour and then drying them in the sun or by artificial heat, preferably the former method. It is not necessary to disinfect in this manner the clothes and personal effects of persons who are not themselves suffering from infection or show suspicious symptoms unless such clothes and personal effects are dirty or in such a condition as to raise a suspicion that they may be contaminated. In all such cases, however, disinfection should, the Governor General in Council considers, be carried out at a railway station near the frontier of the Bombay Presidency and Sind on each of the railway lines leading from those Provinces to other parts of India, and the medical officers at places where disinfection takes place should be instructed to exercise the widest discretion so as to render it quite impossible that articles which may be contaminated shall be passed without being disinfected. It is very desirable that the disinfection should take place at some station at which the train arrives during the day, amongst other reasons because sunlight itself acts as a strong disinfectant. 3. In cases in which the disinfection necessary under these orders cannot otherwise be completed, it will be necessary to detain a por- tion of the passengers until the departure of the next train. No. 91. Telegram No. 1388-P., dated the 9th April 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay,  General   Depart- ment, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Your letter 970 of 16th March about disinfecting clothes con- sidered by our Surgeon-General and special Medical Committee who report that any disinfection scheme will entail detention of pas- sengers for at least 24 hours in observation or quarantine camp, and think detention should extend to seven days as Director General states is done at Khana. Are Government India prepared to impose suitable and sufficient restrictions on railway booking at stations on both sides of disinfection stations ? Otherwise disinfection and detention can be easily evaded by alighting at another station and taking short land journey before re-booking, and it would be wasteful and useless to buy apparatus, employ staff and establish observation camps proposed by Surgeon-General. As to duration of delay caused by disinfection, our experience shows it takes four hours at Karachi and less than one hour at Ahmedabad. c 18

From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Deparlment. Your 1388 of 9th. Government of India understand that Bom- bay Government do not accept view of their Surgeon-General and Special Medical Committee that disinfection scheme will entail deten- tion of passengers for twenty-four hours. Time taken in disinfect- ing will, it appears to Government of India, depend on amount of plant used. It will now be probably impossible to make prompt ar- rangements for disinfecting by steam, and the Government of India suggest the simple plan of boiling all suspected articles. Boiling pro- cess should not take more than quarter of hour and drying process an hour. Orders as to description apply only to articles regarded by the medical officers as suspicious and will be carried out at places where medical inspection of passengers takes place. It is not necessary to detain train or all passengers while this is being done. Passengers with suspicious effects must be detained till disinfection is complete, unless it is considered that they are themselves suspi- cious, when they should be detained until the medical officer is satis- fied that they may proceed. Government of India trust that arrange- ments will be made as soon as possible to carry out disinfection. They recognise that some people may evade it, but no scheme for stopping progress of plague is free from this objection. With reference to Bombay Government's suggestion as to imposition of restrictions on booking at stations on both sides of disinfecting stations, would it not meet Local Government's wishes if names of all suspicious persons leaving train at stations within twenty miles of disinfecting stations on one side were taken and given to station masters at stations within twenty miles on the other side with ins- tructions not to re-book them ?

I am directed to address you, in continuation of my telegram No. 1302, the 15th instant, on the subject of disinfection of the lug- -gage of passengers travelling by railway from areas in which plague prevails. 2. It was stated in my telegram that it will now be probably im- possible to make prompt arrangements for disinfecting by steam,

It was also stated that the boiling process should not take more than a quarter of an hour and the drying pro- cess another hour. I am now to furnish the following details of the procedure re- commended in the cleansing of infected articles, which, if carried out thoroughly, will, the Government of India are advised, afford practical security :- (1)   All articles which the medical officers considered   to  be   in- fected or suspicious, subject to the exceptions noted in clauses (2), (3) and (4), should be boiled for ten minutes   in  a   solution   of   carbolic acid (1-40).*    The temperature of the solution   will   of   course   be temporarily lowered by each article that is plunged into   it,   so   that precaution is necessary, not only to see that each   article   is   so   un- folded as to be exposed in every part,  but   that   every  part  is   sub- jected to the boiling temperature for the   full   ten minutes.      On   re- moval from the boiler, articles should be dried in the sun for at  least an hour. (2)  Articles made of leather, of wood and glue, etc., which would be injured by boiling, should be   soaked   in,   or   thoroughly   mopped with a solution of perchloride of mercury     and   dried   in   the   sun. When it is considered necessary, such articles may,   in   addition,   be washed with a warm 5 per cent. solution   of  carbolic   acid   and   soft soap. (3)   Metallic articles, which may   be   unsuited   to   treatment   by boiling, should be washed and   scrubbed  with   a   warm   5   per  cent. solution of carbolic acid and soft soap and dried in the sun. (4)   Articles capable   of   conveying  infection,   which cannot   be treated in any of these ways, should be burnt. * Carbolic acid solution for boiling should be of the strength of 21/2 per cent., and that for washing 5 per cent. The carbolic acid should be of good commercial quality and free from admixture with tar oils.   The solution of perchloride of mercury should be of the strength of  1-1,000 with either 10-1,000 of common salt or 5-1,000 of hydrochloric acid added. It should be coloured blue with aniline or indigo, to prevent accidents, and should not be exposed to contact with metals. It is desirable to make the solution fre- quently, in comparatively small quantities at a time, and with as pure water as possible. A good solution recommended by the English Local Government Board can be made as follows:- Half an ounce of corrosive sublimate, one fluid ounce of hydrochloric acid and 5 grains of commercial aniline blue, in three gallons of water (strength, 1 of mer- curic chloride in 960).
?140 Measures to prevent the                    [ APP. VIII. 3.  The question of the size and cost of boilers has been consider- ed in connection with the supply of boilers for disinfecting the kit   of European soldiers.    It has been found that a boiler of  15   cubic   feet contents is sufficient for the disinfection of the kit of a single   soldier and that a 15 cubic feet boiler could be constructed   for   Rs.   120,   a 27 cubic feet boiler for Rs. 170 and a 40 cubic feet boiler for Rs. 200. The effects of a native railway passenger will on an average be much less than the kit of a European soldier, and the Government of India have no doubt that the Government of Bombay will not find   it   diffi- cult to determine the size and number of the boilers   to   be   provided at the stations where disinfection takes place. 4.   In the rainy season the  boiling   process   may,   owing  to   the difficulty of drying the clothes, be less easy   to   carry  out.      It   may then be necessary to construct an apparatus for artificially drying the clothes,  and the Government of India   will be  glad   if  the   Govern- ment of Bombay will take this question   into consideration now,   so that arrangements may be made before the rains begin.

CROSTHWAITE, Assistant Commissioner, Dis- infecting Officer, To-The Deputy Commissioner, Mooltan. In compliance with the instructions contained in letter No. 366-S., dated 17th June 1897, from the Junior Secretary to the Government of the Punjab, to the Commissioner and Superintendent, Lahore Division, I have the honor to submit a comprehensive report on the arrangements for disinfection of passengers at Khanpur, to which Surgeon-Lieutenant Milne, Inspecting Medical Officer, has added a supplementary report. Preliminary arrangements. 2. (a) In obedience to telegraphic orders received on the 4th April, I left Mooltan and arrived at Khnpur on the 5th. Although no definite orders had been received, I was informed by Surgeon- Lieutenant Milne that it was intended to establish a disinfection post in Khnpur. Pending receipt of orders I decided after consulta- tion with Surgeon-Lieutenant Milne, to have the camp site cleared, as it was covered with jungle. This site had already been selected by Surgeon-Lieutenant Milne. Sardr Ata Ulla Khn, Chief Judge of Bahwalpur, had arrived at the same time as myself. I arranged with him that the State authorities should collect labour, as none was
?APP. VIII. ]                  spread of infection by land. 143 obtainable locally, and also collect hutting material for the Hospital and Detention lines. I also entertained a Munshi and Chaprsi or Orderly. (b)  No orders   were  received on the 6th, but   on  the   advice   of Mr.   Ritchie, District Loco.    Superintendent, Sukkur, it was decided to build the detention   lines of  unserviceable   sleepers.    I   therefore placed myself in communication with   Mr.   Royal   Dawson, the   Sub- Divisional Officer, who at once placed sleepers at my  disposal.   Over 3,000 unserviceable   sleepers were lying at Khnpur   itself.    During the day  the  camp was   partly  cleared,  and   the sites  of  the lines, latrine, etc., roughly fixed.    Surgeon-Lieutenant Milne estimated that lines for 500 men and   50 women   and   children   would   be  required. Building was then commenced.    I wired to the Deputy Commissioner, Mooltan, for camp servants and also for   information as   to supply   of clothes, etc., procurable, none   of  which  appeared procurable on   the spot.    I also applied to  His Highness the   Nawb through the Chief Judge for two Havildrs and twenty   men   of the  State   Infantry.    I then reported to  the   Deputy Commissioner  (my No.   D.-30,   dated 7th April 1897) the steps taken.    Mr. Rennie, as District Magistrate, had already deputed to   me   full powers under Notification   No. 350, dated 8th March 1897, pending the issue of orders. (c)  On the   7th full   instructions    were    received.    These   were contained in the printed Proceedings of the Plague Conference  held at Lahore on the 3rd   April  and in   a  demi-official letter  dated   the 5th, from the Junior Secretary to   the  Government,   Punjab,    I was able to report that   most  of  these   instructions   were already  being carried out, particularly as regards- (i) Separate hutting of men and women. (ii) Site and size of camp. (iii)  Latrines. (iv)  Supplies. (v) Servants. (vi)  Clothing. By the evening lines were ready for 40 women and children and 100 men. The water-supply had been settled ; dry earth latrines were ready, and shops established. I therefore notified to the Manager, North-Western Railway, that detention would commence next day. (d)    On the morning of the   8th detention  was commenced.    As the tanks had not arrived, disinfection was carried out by boiling in a

Before evening quarters for 200 men were ready and temporary arrangements as to establishment completed. Site of camp. 3. The position of the detention lines, disinfection tanks, etc., etc., is shown in Map A.* The instructions given in paragraph 9, Conference Proceedings, were followed as far as possible, but the side of the Railway opposite the station is south of the line, and not east of it. The State boundary is drawn in accor- dance with their own revenue map and actual possession. The entire Camp, Hospital, etc., lie within British territory. The site was particularly well suited for disinfection purposes, unless its lowness be considered a disadvantage, though these hollows, from which the station has been raised, are not liable to be flooded. The Canal Railway Line and high land to the south made well marked bounda- ries and lessened Police work considerably. The bund running between the men's and women's lines was an unmistakable advantage. The latter could not be seen at all from the former (vide section on G. H., Plan B). The water-supply was conveniently close and the disinfection tanks excellently situated. The sanitary aspect of the camp has been dealt with by the Inspecting Medical Officer. Hutting. 4. (a) Sleeper huts were completed and ready for 200 men and 40 women and children on the evening of the 8th. By the 13th quarters for 375 men, 40 women and children, Special Hut, Police Lines, Office, Hospital Assistant's hut, Intermediate Quarters, Latrines, Bzr and Servants' quarters were complete. The first Police Lines were of grass. These had to be replaced later with sleeper huts of an improved pattern (see Plan B),* as they were twice blown down in storms. The waiting shed, office verandah, etc., were all additions, though most had been originally contemplated. The fact that the harvest was dead ripe forced me to allow all the " chers " or ' corvee ' labourers to go at the earliest opportunity. Most were dismissed on the 12th, the rest on the 13th. (b)  Plan B gives  a  detailed   plan  with   sections,   elevations,   etc. The main feature of the lines was the cell unit; composed of one side, back and roof, dimensions as in margin, height 8' 6" at back, sloping to 7' 6" in front. Each cell fitted to the next gave a separate " kotha." The women's lines contained 10 cells, morning lines 1, 2 and 3 (see Plan B) 17 each, evening lines 4, 5, 6 and 7, 12 NOTE.-For  disinfection  advantages  of  cell   system,   see    Inspecting   Medical Officer's Report. * See map in Vol. IV, page 18.

The building was done as follows :-The cell or line of cells was marked out with pegs and string. Between each two pegs was one task to which one man was allotted. All could work simultaneously. The dotted line gives the earth removed (to the width of a " khi " blade) ; the arrows the direction digging proceeded in to a depth of 2' to 2' 6". When the earth had been removed the sleepers were simply stood up in the trenches and the earth rammed back. Any Munshi can lay out the tracings and any person supervise the work. The number of sleepers required for any given line of cells is 31x + 10, x being the number of cells. The total number of sleepers used was 6,003. Of these about 150 were cut up for struts. The remainder are practically of the same value as when received. The iron dogs used (vide Plan B) were made of rod iron procured from Mooltan. Roofs were composed of sleepers laid broadways, the cross beam being always a " bridge sleeper." These can be recognized by their creasote coatings. Over the roof was laid "serkhna " grass, and this was " lepped " with mud. In receiving sleepers, care should be taken that they are stacked into piles of hundreds before delivery. This I omitted, and found it a cause of trouble afterwards. (c) The advantages of sleeper huts over grass huts are as follows:- (i)  more quickly erected; (ii) less expensive; (iii) better protection against the sun; (iv)  possibility of disinfection; (v)  comparatively no danger of fire. It was objected that disinfection would be difficult. Surgeon-Colonel Raye, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, decided that, under ordinary circumstances, copious syringing with a solution of  1:1,000 of corrosive sublimate would be sufficient. This has been carried out. A Holborn garden force pump, cost Rs. 5, supplied by the North- Western Railway Stores Department, has been found very useful. The subject has, however, been fully dealt with by the Inspecting Medical Officer. (d) The final pattern of latrine consisted in a long trench from 3 feet to 4 feet deep, the width of a country spade, or khai, in width; this was partitioned off at every two feet by a two foot square screen, c  19
?146 Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. and the whole was enclosed by a high screen. The trench as used was gradually filled up with dry earth mixed with a little carbolic powder. When full, a new trench was dug and the screens shifted. The small two foot screens gave a certain amount of individual privacy. Before they were put up 1 received some complaints on this score. Police arrangements. 5. (a) Before receiving the orders referred to in paragraph 2 (c) I had indented on the State for two havildrs and twenty men of the State Infantry. I received two sergeants and 12 men of the ordinary State Troops. These were employed on the three picquets shown in Map A. I found it convenient to assume the nullah and high land as camp limits, and placed the picquets accordingly. These picquets did not visit the detention lines except to make reports or to join hands with Police patrols. Their main duties are detailed in Appendix A. In addition one sergeant or havildr and one sepoy met each train to deal with local passengers. (b) On the 8th April 2 sergeants and 20 constables arrived from Mooltan. Their sentries are shown in Map A and Standing Orders as part of Appendix A. Their other duties were to assist in maintaining the Camp Orders or Rules. This they were fairly successful in, but the passengers were somewhat hard to manage at times. On one or two occasions large bodies of native soldiers (in one case over 100 Pathans of the Biluch Regiments) were in the camp. They had no native officer with them. The standing feud between the native soldier and policemen is always liable to lead to trouble. (c) Three sergeants and nine constables acted as train patrols. These arrived on the 5th May. One sergeant and three constables accompanied each passenger train up. Goods trains were from time to time accompanied by two constables. Their operations were checked through the reports of the ticket collectors, copies of which, through the courtesy of the District Traffic Superintendent, Sukkur, were placed at my disposal. Camp Standing Orders. 6. (a) The Camp Standing Orders or Rules regulating the arrangements of the camp are given as Appendix B. All passengers were directed to make themselves acquainted with these rules. Those who could not read stood to hear some literate person read them. Their existence was frequently justified. In obedience to the wish of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, I made no use whatever of my magisterial powers beyond an inquiry into the circumstances of the case of Kishan Chand (my letter No. D.-2, dated 2nd May, and sub- sequent correspondence.) The Standing Orders, however, contained a warning that disobedience of their provisions would bring the offenders within the scope of Section 188, Indian Penal Code.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 147 (b) In addition to these Rules the " Reasons for Disinfection," given as part of the same Appendix, were posted throughout the camp. Passengers inquiring why they were detained, a numerous and usually well-educated class, were referred to them for explanation. It is believed that these reasons, in default of better, were usually accepted as sufficient. Discussion as to the expediency of detaining any particular passenger, and the consequent waste of time, were avoided. Daily routine. 7. The Camp Time-Table was as follows :- Sunrise ... First inspection of clothes [vide paragraph 9 (a)]. A.M. 7-11 ... Arrival of 23 Up Mixed [vide paragraphs 9 and 11 (b)].. " 7-45 or 8 ... Inspection of clothing by Inspecting Medical Officer and Disinfecting Officer [vide paragraph 9 (b) and (c) and Supplement- ary Report]. ,, 9 ... Inspection of passengers [see Supplement- ary Report]. " 10 ... Disinfection tanks opened [see paragraph 8 (e)]. " 10-30 ... Clothes distributed [see paragraph 8 (e).] P.M. 5-30 ... Second inspection of passengers and their entraining [paragraph 8 (b) and (c) and Supplementary Report]. " 6-20 ... Arrival of 7 Up Mail [see paragraph 11 (b)].  Disinfection. 8. (a) At sunrise the Camp Hospital Assistant saw that all kits belonging to men, passengers of the mail train on the previous even- ing, were opened up and laid in the sun. (b) At 8 A.M., the passengers by the 23 Up Mixed having been escorted to the lines and their clothes laid out, I inspected all their kits, selecting clothing, etc., to be steamed, sun disinfected or des- troyed. As each passenger's property was inspected, he was ordered to take the clothes to be steamed at the tanks; clothes to be sunned were placed on the cell roofs or on charps; clothing to be destroyed was handed over to the sweeper. (c) On arrival at the tanks the clothes were laid lengthways and tied in the middle, not rolled up in a cloth. A brass number was attached to the clothes and the duplicate retained by the passenger. Companions frequently made one bundle of all their clothes. Before leaving their clothes each passenger was supplied, if he desired it,
?148 Measures to prevent the                      [ APP. VIII. with a "langocha" or waist cloth. The Camp Hospital Assistant was responsible for these arrangements, but he was frequently super- vised by Mr. Taylor, the Loco. Foreman. The passenger next bathed either in the tank or under the Engine Hydrant (vide Plan B) as taste or caste advised. He then returned to the lines to await inspection (see Supplementary Report). (d)  Though under   the instructions   of  the   Plague   Conference clothes were supposed to be provided, yet in practice no other clothes beyond " langochas " were ordinarily   supplied  or  asked   for.    Most passengers  had   spare   clothes,   but many preferred to remain in the "langocha " only until   after   inspection.    Men   of   the  better   class sometimes asked for clothes, and these were   at once   supplied   from the Store.    The "langochas" were washed daily and frequently  dis- infected. Ordinarily no caste prejudice was shown as to their use, and Hindu and Muhammadan used them indiscriminately. Some of the Nanak-panth Sikhs, especially Turkhans, and a few Akalis, who wore the " Katch " or short drawers, objected to the "langocha." Short drawers of the correct pattern were kept in stock and issued them, their old ones being destroyed. A few Muhammadans objected to their clothes being steamed on the ground that they were " Namazai." This objection was easily overcome by allowing them a tub of cold water in which to rinse their clothes after disinfection. (e)  The tanks were closed for an hour.    After  re-opening   half an hour was allowed for the tank to cool and the   clothes  were   then taken out, the brass labels collected and the clothes returned to their owners.    Any case of injury to the clothes or loss was at once noted by the Hospital Assistant and reported to me for award of compensa- tion.    These cases were very few in number. (f) (1) The tanks used were four in number. At first disin- fection was carried out by boiling in a small tank over a wood fire. Mr. Ritchie, District Loco, Superintendent, however, fitted this tank with a steam injector which kept the water constantly above boiling point. The use of this tank was discontinued when the camp received the two large tanks. (2) The second tank was received from Lahore on the 10th April. This tank was only 4' x 4' x 4'. Its small size rendered it practically useless. On its arrival it was unprovided with a safety valve; the bottom cock was an inch above the bottom, and rust and dirty water accumulated, spoiling clothes. These defects were NOTE.-If these arrangements were continued in the cold weather, blanket, coat and trousers would become a necessity. "Langochas" can only be considered a hot weather arrangement.
?APP. VIII. ]                  spread of infection by land. 149 cured, but after about a month's use it commenced leaking at the seams. Its small size did not allow of more than 12 kits being placed in it, and the stays in it prevented the extrication of the clothes in any other way than with an iron hook. This caused delay and in- jury. Each steaming lasting an hour, the day's passengers would never have been disinfected. (3) At my request Mr. Ritchie, District Loco. Superintendent, provided (within 24 hours) two metre guage water tanks, inside measurements 131/2' x 21/2' x 6'. These were fitted with large man- holes and wood-lined. The wood work, besides saving injury to the clothes from rust stains, divided the interior into 6, leaving a central passage which allowed the tankman free access to all parts of the tank interior. The manhole covers were fitted with double safety valves, allowing the air to enter the tank as it cooled. These were regulated at 61bs. Each tank would hold about one hundred and twenty kits. (4)   All three tanks connected with one pipe, each having a cut- off cock, allowing any or all to be used. (5)   The   cost of the small tank was Rs. 322-6-4.    The total ex- penditure on the other two Rs. 427-2-7.    The advantage   in   employ- ing the  latter  is  obvious.    The  larger   the tank is, the quicker and easier the work of disinfection. (6)   An additional tank was made at Lahore 8 x 8 x 4 feet,   at a   cost   of Rs.  428.    It  has  not been considered advisable to bring this down to Khnpur, the present two metre guage  tanks   disposing of the work satisfactorily.    The question of cost has been referred to Government. (g) The pressure of steam in the tanks was 61bs. The tempera- ture within them presumably from 225 to 230 F. The time of expos- ure to its effects one hour. The Inspecting Medical Officer has disposed of the efficacy of the disinfection in his Supplementary Report. (h) The furnace used for destruction of the clothes was of my own design and somewhat primitive. I was unable to get any design to work on. It was practically an open iron grating with mud walls round, and three indraft apertures in them below the grating. The clothes were placed on the grating and a handful of grass ignited below. The pile was kept at a blaze and nothing was left, but a handful of ashes. This was removed daily and buried. Compensation. 9. (a) During the inspection of clothes (see paragraph 8 (b) I was accompanied by my Head Clerk with a rough Compensation Register
?150 Measures to prevent the                      [APP. VIII. and some tin tickets of the form shown in the margin. As any proper- ty was destroyed, compensation in clothes or cash was at once awarded and entered up in the rough register, the owner receiving a tin ticket As soon as the men appeared at inspection, which took place directly after, the clothes or cash was given them and the ticket redeemed. The Compensation Register had been previously written up and check- ed. If the man's whole property or much of it was destroyed he was provided with the new clothes first. It was impossible in practice to carry out the instructions received to pay the compensation as it was awarded. (b)  The women's   clothes were   disposed of  by   the   Inspecting Medical Officer and Female Hospital Assistant.    The rough   register was brought  to  me   before   entry  in  the   Compensation   Register- Clothes were then issued from store and money paid over  to Hydari Begum, Female Hospital Assistant, who distributed it. (c)  In awarding compensation   I   have   endeavoured to  give fair awards, but somewhat in favor of the owner.    Consequently my award has only once or twice been objected to and then when a money award. (d)   A full statement of all clothes destroyed and   issued   between the 8th April and 8th July is added  to  this   report  as   Appendix C. The men's clothes were made up of  "kadr"   or country  cloth at   13 yards the rupee.    Women's and children's clothes of "mrkn" at  11 yards, and " sussi " at 9 yards.    The cloth was procured and made up locally.    The  Female Hospital   Assistant supervised the   making of all clothes for women   and   children.    The men's   suits of   " kourta," " pyjma," " waistcoat" and " sfa " were all of one size.    Their being too large for the majority of the recipients was not   regarded   as   any disadvantage.    Suits for women and children were made  in   varying sizes.    Blankets were purchased at Mooltan at a cost of   Re.   1-5-10 each, including carriage.    Rezis were not kept.    Owners of old and tattered ones willingly  accepted blankets.    The total cost,  including tailors's bills, etc., of actual clothes was Rs. 356-13-6, of blankets  Rs. 342-4-6, giving the total cost of compensation in clothes as Rs. 699-2-0. Details  as to numbers, etc.,  is   supplied  in Appendix C.    The cost of making up men's suits was Re. 1-6-0 " kourta," the same for "pyj- mas" 6 pie a cap, 9 pie a " waistcoat."   The women making up clothes were  paid   5   annas a  day.    The actual cost of the  " kourta"   and "pyjmas" made up was  12 annas.    The   women's clothes   varied extremely. Train arrange- ments. 10. (a) When the disinfection post was first started and   deten- tion enforced, the only precaution taken was that the doors of the 3rd
?APP. VIII. ]                spread of infection by land. 151 class and Intermediate carriages were locked at Rahm Yr Khn and Kot Samba.    This   precaution  was  intended  to prevent   any passenger evading inspection by the Inspecting Medical Officer,  and had been in force some time.    Before detention commenced  a tele- gram (demi-official, dated 7th April 1897)  was   sent  to   Government, asking whether booking to Kot Samba, Rahm Yr Khn and Sadq- abad could not be stopped, as there was, in the absence of all restric- tions, every possibility of passengers evading detention by leaving the train at those stations.    It was not considered necessary to   take any such steps at the time.    I subsequently again asked (my demi-official dated 13th April 1897) that  no 3rd or  Intermediate class   passenger be allowed to alight between Reti and   Khnpur, and that   all   such passengers who had   booked   to   the   intermediate   stations  be   first compelled to pass through the Disinfection   Post   at   Khnpur.    This step was at first considered unnecessary.    At a later stage,  however, in consequence of certain cases of evasion having occurred,   Notifica- tion No. 823, dated  29th   April  1897, was published.    Under  this notification all  3rd and   Intermediate   class   passengers   booked   to stations between Reti and Khnpur are first brought to Khnpur and then returned after disinfection.    Over 5 per cent. of the   number  so disinfected have afterwards proceeded towards Mooltan.    It is   only reasonable to suppose that the number endeavouring to evade deten- tion would have been much larger.    Many of this 5   per   cent.    have admitted to me that they had purposely booked short.   It is, however, clear that a strip of country or section of railway must be kept closed if it is desired to ensure   the   disinfection   of  all   persons   travelling from infected districts by rail.    It is true   that  the   State   stationed disinfection posts at the   stations   below Khnpur,   but   until  these were reorganized by Surgeon-Captain Heard, Medical Adviser to His Highness the Nawb, their proceedings were simply farcical.    Under present arrangements if a man alights at Reti and marches to   Firoza beyond Khnpur, there can be  little   doubt   as  to the   state of  his health.    At present with the out-booking stopped   and  the   roads in the State thoroughly   patrolled,  there   can   be   little   chance of  any body of travellers from infected districts getting into the Puniab. Detraining of passengers and removal to the Lines. II. (a) The actual arrangement for detention of passengers is as follows. On the arrival of the evening train the Inspecting Me-  dical Officer and Disinfecting Officer see each carriage. The former  examines all 1st and 2nd class passengers. Any to be detained are locked into their carriages. The Camp Clerks then enter up the Nos. of tickets and passengers' names and parentage: those of the women are entered up in a separate slip by the Female Hospital Assistant, which is afterwards copied into the Camp Registers. One 3rd class
?152 Measures to prevent the                       [ APP. VIII. compartment is reserved for railway servants on duty, Fuel Contractors, State Excise Contractors, Post Office officials and others travelling locally on duty. These men's passes are examined and they are let out. The outgoing train stands on line No. 2 (see Map A) and in this are the disinfected passengers. Two constables are placed between the two trains to prevent any one slipping out of the incoming train. On the completion of the Inspecting Medical Officer's examination the whole train is taken out to No. 5 line (see Map A), the 1st and 2nd class passengers and contents of Brake and Postal Van having been previously transferred, though the use of this latter step is not very apparent, so long as neither Postal officials, bags, nor contents of Brake Van, are disinfected. The Camp Clerks, Hospital Assistant and all Police on duty accompanied the train to No. 5 line. On its arrival there the remaining passengers were entered in the Register and the male passengers conducted to the detention lines by the Disinfecting Officer and quartered. The women were taken by a separate route to the Women's Lines by the Female Hospital Assistant and the Dhai. The camp water-carriers attended to carry the women's baggage, etc. (b) On the withdrawal of the incoming train the outgoing train was brought on to the platform and was generally despatched before the incoming passengers were clear of their train. This was a distinct advantage, as the passengers quickly resigned themselves to their stay in the lines when they found the other train had already left. Women's enclo- sure. 12. The women's lines were, as originally directed, placed entirely under the charge of Hydari Begum, Female Hospital Assistant under the supervision of the Inspecting Medical Officer. Every effort has been made to avoid any inconvenience or discomfort to the women. Women of the better class with their husbands have been, so far as possible, allowed the use of the intermediate quarters (see Plan B), which is also under Hydari Begum's charge. I would point out in this connection that it is not practicable to use sweeper women to carry clothes, as recommended by the Plague Conference. Many castes would consider the clothes defiled and decline to receive them again. But the women's lines have been dealt with fully by the Inspecting Medical Officer. I have only to add that Hydari Begum has made herself thoroughly respected and liked by all with whom she has been brought in contact. A woman of less strength of char- acter would never have been able to manage the women's enclosure with half her success. Water-supply. 13. (a) The camp has been dependent for its water-supply on the Railway tanks. These are two in number, measure each 51' x 138' x
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 153 5', and contain 45,5621/2 gallons. They are filled by the pumping engines from the two wells shown in map A. The water is considered good by the Inspecting Medical Officer. The supply has through- out been sufficient though care had to be taken latterly as the wells ran low. On the 10th April Mr. Ritchie laid water on into the centre of the camp and supplied a standpipe and tap. This has been most useful. It has not been possible to have a drain from the standpipe. A pit was dug, where the water collected under it, and lined with ashes. This was baled out twice a day and disinfectants thrown into it. (b) A reserve moveable tank, Jacobabad pattern, holding 3,490 gallons, was lent by the railway authorities. The water was used for washing purposes. It was filled from the engine hydrants. (c) The daily consumption of water exceeded 6,000 gallons, the bathing tank alone using 4,000. Food-supply. 14. (a) The State supplied one bania for the camp. He was  found by the city and received, I am told, Rs. 75 a month from the other traders. As, however, the station food contractor eagerly set up a rival shop, it is probable that business was good. A weekly price list was obtained from the Krdar and prices regulated by it (vide Camp Standing Orders). (b) The food supplied was not of the best quality, nor could good food always be procured. Summary justice, however, in the shape of destruction of all supplies condemned by the Inspecting Medical Officer, kept the supplies as good as they could be. Vegetables were scarce and of bad quality. Mutton almost unprocurable and very bad. Goat's flesh equally bad. Under the Inspecting Medical Officer's advice the sale of meat within the lines was forbidden. The pur- chase of liquor or drugs was prohibited. Liquor in the possession of passengers was sometimes stored in the office till their departure. The railway icemen were encouraged to sell rated waters and ice to passengers in the lines. Establishment, 15. (a) The strength of the establishment is given as an appen- dix. Their ordinary duties have already been described in various paragraphs. (b) Many of the establishment had only one suit on their arrival. A second suit at half price was supplied them from the stores. Their clothes were disinfected once a week. Care should be taken that the sweepers do not collect rags, etc., thrown away by passengers. Here the huts were inspected weekly. c 20
?154 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. (c) Some of the establishment first entertained was found to be unnecessary. The final numbers as shown in Appendix D are the minimum strength with which 200 travellers can be disposed of daily. (d) Considerable difficulty was experienced by the Deputy Com- missioner, Mooltan, in obtaining men, even at the high rates offered, the terrible death-rate amongst municipal servants in plague centres being the deterrent. (e) I have already drawn attention to the excellent work of Hydari Begum. The Head Clerk, Abdul Karim, has also worked very well, and his industry has been marked. Fazl Din, Hospital Assistant, has carried out the duties entrusted to him satisfactorily. Accounts and Registers. 16. The following list gives all the Camp Accounts and Registers. The form of those marked with an asterisk is given in Appendix E:- (a) Cash Book, containing in addition record of cheques issued and cashed- (One copy in English.) ( Ditto Vernacular.)

The total expenditure is shown in the Abstracts Statement, Appen- dix F. The total number of clothes destroyed and given as compensation, in Appendix C. General remarks. 18. Fire arrangements.-No cooking was allowed inside the cells. With sleeper huts there was comparatively little fear of fire. Each cell contained one or more ghurras, which were kept filled. A small fire-engine was also kept in the Engine House and would have
?APP. VIII.] spread of infection by land. 155 been at once available (see Plan B). Five buckets were also kept at the station and at the wood piles. The latter were kept filled. Five fire buckets were kept in the Women's Lines. Lighting.-Large station lamps were used. These were supplied by the North-Western Railway Stores. Charpoys.-It was impossible to supply all passengers with char- poys. The banias and one contractor were allowed to hire out charpoys at 3 pie the night or 6 pie the 24 hours. A certain number of reserve charpoys belonging to the lines were entrusted to the contractor, who hired them out, receiving 2 annas per rupee as his share of the profits. This brought in a small amount, but more than their value. The Women's Lines were supplied first with charpoys. Gcvernment servants on sick leave were supplied free. Caste prejudice.-The question of caste prejudice, re disinfection, has already been discussed. It was found advisable to reserve one line for Hindus, one for Muhammadans and one for Native soldiers. Sweepers were allotted a distinct line. Certain Hindus, Vishs and down-country or Purbyiah Brahmins objected to drinking the tank water. They were not allowed to fetch other water, as this would have been from the nearest nallah. It was understood that the protest relieved their conscience. Attitude towards plague precautions.-Generally speaking the average passenger considered the precautions worse than the disease. They would have preferred no action whatever being taken. The native railway officials were actively or passively hostile. Languages.-It is advisable to have Pashtu and Persian speaking men among the Camp establishment. Both my Munshi and Orderly spoke Pashtu. I found some acquaintance with Persian and Pashtu useful. Conclusion. 19. I have in conclusion to particularly thank the management of  the North-Western Railway for their ever-ready help and for their support to measures that frequently tended to kill traffic and cause loss of revenue. To Mr. Ritchie, District Loco. Superintendent, Sukkur, I am especially indebted for his help and advice. Among the minor railway officials, Mr. Roach, Station Master, and Kali Charan, Assistant Station Master, have helped me in every way. I have also met with much help from Mr. Taylor, Loco. Fore- man, who has devoted much of his spare time to superintending the actual disinfecting arrangements. Mr. Donohue, Permanent-Way Inspector, has aided me frequently in building operations.
?156 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. I beg finally to draw the attention of Government to Surgeon- Lieutenant Milne's cordial co-operation in all matters connected with the camp, even where I had no right to ask his aid. His advice has been of the greatest use to me throughout, and the whole sanitary arrangements of the camp have been entirely in his hands. Report B. I ( to company Disinfection/30), dated Khnpur,-July 1897 From-SURGEON-LIEUTENANT C. J. MILNE, M.B., I.M.S., Inspecting Medical Oficer, Khnpur, To-The Deputy Commissioner, Mooltan. I have the honour to forward the following supplementary report to that herewith submitted by Lieutenant J. G. Crosthwaite, the Disinfecting Officer, who has been associated with me in the work of retarding the spread of the plague into the Punjab from Sind since the 5th April 1897: - 1. In accordance with instructions received from the Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals I arrived at Khnpur on the morning of the 19th January and assumed charge of my duties as an Inspecting Medical Officer at once. The work done between that date and the date when detention commenced will be embodied in my final report to be submitted by me to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals in the Punjab when my duties here are terminated. 2. On the 31st March I received a letter No. 1240, dated 3oth March 1897, from the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, enclosing a copy of a letter (No. 510, dated 26th March 1897) from the Junior Secretary to Government in the Punjab. In this letter the Inspecting Medical Officers at the chief places of inspection in the Punjab were requested to report on the time required by them to inspect trains, and also to suggest any alteration in the method of inspection. I replied to this in my No. 39-A., dated 2nd April 1897, in which I suggested the detention of all passengers (and the disinfection of their kits) for 24 hours at least if a ten days' detention could not be enforced. The suggestion to detain, etc., the passengers thus made seems to have met with the approval of the Plague Committee, who met in Lahore on the following day, April 3rd, as on the evening of that date I received a telegram stating that such had been adopted. Next morning, April 4th, I received a demi-official with preliminary instruc- tions with regard to the detention, but pending the arrival of the Assistant Commissioner and the Bahwalpur representative, I could do nothing but go over the ground where the camp could be formed. This I did, and the site chosen was fully approved of by the others on their arrival on the 5th. The subsequent proceedings are fully
?157 APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. detailed by Mr. Crosthwaite and I have but to supplement his remarks with the following notes. The site of the camp. In the selection of a site for the camp in question-proximity to  the engine shed-the source of our means of steam disinfection, etc.  had to be chiefly considered. Very luckily the ground alongside of the shed and a continuation eastwards of the lowlying waste ground wherein the hospital was placed, presented so many natural aids to such a camp as ours that its selection was at once justified. That the site is a healthy one may be judged from the fact that among all the staff who are permanently resident there, including the police, there has only been one case of illness requiring admission to the hospital, and only very few cases of any sort (chiefly among the Police) requiring any attention whatever. The huts. 4. The points in connection with the housing of the persons in  rows of sleeper huts such as has been carried out, to which I wish to refer, may be classed under the following heads :- (a) With reference to the occurrence in them of cases of suspicious or actual plague and how the hut was to be rendered free of further infection. In my demi-official dated April 16th, to the Inspector-General of SECTION OF HUTS. A. Before extraction of the infected one.   *  *        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12    * *        B. After the demolition of the same. 1 2 * 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Civil Hospitals, I explain- ed the method we had decided to adopt in the event of such an incident occurring. It was that the section of the row of huts be extracted and the sleepers forming the roof and walls of the section be burnt. The ground on which the hut had stood was to be dug up and treated similarly to that on which a case had died in the hospital. Represented diagram- atically supposing A. in the row of huts 1 -12 a case of plague had occurred in No. 4, then all the sleepers between the points marked by a red cross were to be taken out and burnt. Fig. B. shows the appearance the row of huts would present after the demolition of the infected one.
?158 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. (b) The monthly disinfection of the huts by syringing with I : 1,000 corrosive sublimate solution. This necessary procedure was rigorously carried out as directed by Surgeon-Colonel Raye. One hundred gallons of such a solution were required in order to disinfect the 118 huts in the camp. This involved roughly the expenditure of 1lb. of the antiseptic in question. (c) The huts as a protection from the elements. (1) The temperature.-With regard to the heat, the position of the huts (facing the east) and the solidity of their roofs were a considerable protection from the hot rays of the midday and afternoon sun. Still, as the month of May progressed complaints as to the heat were not infrequent, and one or two cases of slight fever were probably due to the same. The erection of the Inspection Chhappar under which a considerable number of the detenus could accommodate themselves during the day has been found to greatly alleviate these conditions. (2) Rain and Storms.-These are of very rare occurrence, but this year have been more frequent than for many years past. Rain unaccompanied by wind gave no trouble, but when wind was present the front row of huts as a rule suffered, the others only leaking slightly and to an inappreciable extent. The addition of a small verandah cover of sarkhna grass which has been suggested would be of immense help not only as a protection from rain, but also aiding the protection from the sun. Should the camp be likely to continue for any length of time, this addition will be undertaken. I am strongly of opinion that sleeper huts made in the form carried out are infinitely more satisfactory than grass ones for such a purpose as ours has been. The water-sup- ply. 5. In addition to the abundance of the supply we have been very fortunate in having water of such excellent quality. The standpipe laid down into the centre of the camp by Mr. Ritchie proved a great boon to all concerned. The pipes conveying it were carefully covered, and cool water has been procurable at all times during the day. The tank supplied by the railway was a most excellent reserve for cases of emergency, but has rarely been put in requisition. Should a similar camp ever be formed again on a larger scale, such tanks would be of extreme importance, but it would be necessary to erect some sort of a structure over them so as to prevent the water getting so hot as to be unfit for drinking purposes. The general sani- tary arrange- ments. 6. (I) The lines themselves were kept scrupulously clean. The moment the passengers had evacuated them at 5 P.M., the whole of the sweepers were enjoined to overhaul the lands thoroughly.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 159 (2) As regards the important matter of latrines, the system originally suggested and adopted was that of an enclosure in which a number of receptacles were placed. These when soiled were to be carried away at once to the trenches, which were some 70 yards distant, by the attendant sweepers. But this method was quite impracticable. After the arrival of the train the latrines were so crowded that do what the sweepers could they were unable to do their work quickly enough to be satisfactory, and the smell, etc., gave rise to frequent complaint. We then made the long trenches over which the men could sit, and this system has proved admirable. The trenches are two in number, each 50 yards long, and about 80 men can use them at once. All that the sweepers have to do is to run along the line and throw in earth and carbolic powder. Since this system has been in vogue there has not been the slightest odour apparent. The trenches have been visited daily once or twice by either the Hospital Assistant or myself. For the reception of urine, a number of flat gumlahs, one foot in diameter, were placed in the latrines. They were filled with sawdust (an idea suggested by reading Dr. Poore's paper in the Journal of State Medicine for January 1897). No smell was caused, and at the end of the day the sawdust was burnt. I have reason to think, however, that the men used trenches for urination to a great extent. (3) A "pucca" incinerator not being considered advisable we built a small cutcha one in which condemned clothes and the other refuse of the camp were burnt. The disinfection of clothing. 7. Since the tanks were erected disinfection by steam of the men's  clothing at least has been adopted on all occasions. Prior to this boiling or steeping in antiseptic solutions were employed, and these methods have been continued with regard to the women's clothing in the majority of instances. Women travelling alone could not be prevailed on to part with their clothing, and so steam disinfection was only used when they were willing to hand over their clothes to their husbands, etc. I regret very much that I was unable to obtain a thermometer by which the exact heat in the tanks could be ascertained. From various observations (Parkes' Hygiene, vide pages 440 et seq., etc.) I have calculated that with our pressure of 6lbs. the temperature in the tanks rose to 220-230 F., probably nearer the latter figure. Taking the latest authority on the subject, Dr. W. R. Smith in his paper on steam disinfectors in the May number of the Journal of
?160 Measures to prevent the. [ APP. VIII. State Medicine, we find him stating "that many of the pathogenic organisms (i.e., the non-spore bearing ones) have their thermal death- points for 10 minutes exposure at or below 60 C. (140 F.)." As the plague bacillus is a non-spore bearing pathogenic organism similar to the ones he mentions, I have but little doubt in stating that our steam disinfection at six pounds pressure for an hour was thoroughly efficacious with regard to the disease in question. Great care was taken, too, that the clothes be loosely tied up and loosely packed so as to ensure the penetration of the steam. The ablutionary arrangements. 8. One of the hollow spaces between the rails near an engine- house used for working at the under parts of an engine proved, when filled with water from the adjoining hydrant, to be a most excellent swimming bath. Many of the men, however, preferred the shower bath afforded by the hydrant, and either method was perfectly satis- factory. The medical inspections. 9. All trains coming here from Karachi were inspected on arrival. Obviously sick persons were removed to the hospital at once and the remainder of the 3rd and Intermediate passengers were carefully observed as they passed from the train into the landis. First and second class passengers were invariably examined on the platform and passed, unless their condition or the state of their clothing was absolutely prohibitive. The persons booking from Khnpur were similarly inspected. Every day at 9 A.M., after all clothes had been handed in for disinfection and every person had bathed, a thorough inspection of every person took place. Many cases of slight fever, especially in the earlier days, were detected, and these were either detained in special huts built for the purpose, or, if considered necessary, were taken to the hospital. When a passenger had thus been disinfected, bathed and passed, he had Khnpur stamped on the back of his ticket. At 5 P.M., the passengers from the preceding mail and mixed trains were let off, each person being observed as he left the landing and his ticket examined for the stamp noted in order to assure us that the conditions of his detention had been fulfilled. From April 8th to July 8th, 13,876 persons had been detained-, etc., in the landis. In addition to this I inspected about 5,794 others on the platform, making a grand total of 19,670 inspected during that time. Out of that number it was found necessary to admit into hospital under observation as suspicious 19 persons. Nine of these were actually sick, the remaining ten being their companions.

The nine cases are certified in the Admission and Discharge Book of the hospital as follows : - Remittent Fever 4 Malarial cachexia 1 Bronchitis 1 Tubercle of lung 2 Heat apoplexy 1 TOTAL 9 All of these recovered with the exception of one of the cases of tubercle of the lung admitted into hospital in a moribund condition on the 4th July and who succumbed on the 6th. No case of actual plague was detected during the period. The last case which affords grounds for the suspicion that it was a case of so-called pneumonic form of bubonic plague (so ably described by Childe and others, the reading of whose experiences bias me in this opinion) was a man who died on the 9th April and who was admitted with symptoms of fever and bronchitis on the 7th. Every case admitted into hospital was treated with the same pre- cautions which would have been observed in undoubted cases of bubonic plague. A sepoy of the 25th Bengal Infantry proceeding on sick leave met with an accident at Hamai station. He arrived here suffering from acute synovitis (right knee) complicated by a suppurating wound which fortunately did not communicate with the joint. Dr. Rave permitted his admission into the Railway Hospital on the 25th April, and under treatment there he recovered so as to be able to proceed on his journey on the 15th of May. In addition to these no less than 155 cases of fever were detected. These were trivial and mostly due to the heat of the journey, etc. Retention in the huts for the purpose built midway between the hospital and the landis for two or three days sufficed to prove the nature of the case, and these patients were discharged as soon as they had recovered. None of them ever required transference to hos- pital. Surprise has been expressed at the small number admitted into hospital, but people are oblivious to the fact that natives, or in fact any one, will rarely travel when sick, and certainly not at such a time as the present, when detention, etc., were being- enforced.

?162 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. of the female enclosure. Mr. Crosthwaite requested me, as he had so much to do with the men, to generally supervise all matters connected with the women and children. Female Hospital Assistant Hydari Begum met the trains along with ourselves and took charge of the women's carriage at once. After detention commenced no inspection of women took place at the station, except in the case of 1st and 2nd class passengers, who were examined in the carriages. When the train had reached the siding, the women were taken off by the Assistant and her staff to the zanana. There she made her inspection, reporting at once if any of the women were ill, etc. At the same time that the clothes inspection took place in the male landis, the Assistant and her staff made a complete examination of the women's kits. Clothes to be destroyed were separated from those for disinfection and this being done, the Assistant sent for me to come and decide compensation, etc. On the occasions of my entering the zanana, the purdah women were placed in a screened hut, and queries, if necessary, transmitted through the Assistant. Disinfection was carried out by boiling or by soaking in corrosive sublimate solution. Women very rarely trusted their clothes out of their sight even to their husbands, etc., but as often as possible this was done and the steam tank employed. Male passengers who had women- kind in the " zanana " were only allowed to converse with them at some distance from the entrance to the enclosure. They were freely permitted to do this as often as they chose. With the exception of myself when summoned and accompanied by the Assistant, I have reason to believe that the rule excluding all male passengers from the precincts of the zanana has never been transgressed. No cases of serious illness have been found among the women. A weakly infant born before its time and only 2 or 3 weeks old died shortly after its arrival at Khnpur on a very hot day. The matter was reported, and the usual precautions taken. On no less than two occasions have women been admitted into the zanana with babes born in the trains, and to these, as to all the passengers who came under her, was every possible attention paid by Hydari Begum irrespective of caste, creed or status. I really cannot speak too highly of Hydari Begum's services. In a trying position she has shown both ability and tact. Note.-There was a small latrine for females (see maps) near the zanana. This was worked on the original trench latrine system and proved satisfactory.

Food. II. The matter of food has been a most serious one for every-  body here. It is seemingly impossible to get good fresh meat during the hot weather. The shop-keepers were allowed at first to provide meat, but as daily complaints were made by the passengers, I in- quired into the matter and was compelled to prohibit its sale in the lines. Vegetables are scarce and of inferior quality, and what was more serious, the atta, etc., sold by the banias had more than once to be condemned. All the best of the food-stuffs at Khnpur are ex- ported, and the matter of the provision of a sufficient and good supply of food-stuffs ought to be primarily considered when such a camp is formed again, essential as it is to the health of all concerned. Conclusion. 12. I have in conclusion to thank Lieutenant J. G. Crosthwaite,  Assistant Commissioner, I.S.C., for his many kindly services to me during our stay here together. He has worked indefatigably and has exhibited the most marked interest in the details of the work, much of which lay entirely beyond his province. Additional Note.-Two days after Mr. Crosthwaite had handed over to me I was relieved by Surgeon-Captain H. Smith, to whom I showed all the details of the work, and who is now carrying it on.

From-The Chief Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, the accompaying copy of a letter No. 136-XVI-404-B.-164, dated the 8th March 1897, and enclosure, to the address of the Agent, Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, on the subject of the disinfection of carriage used by a person suffer- ing from a contagious disease. No. 136/XVI-404-B.-164, dated Allahabad, the 8th March 1897. From--The Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. To-The Agent, Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2107-T., dated 24th February 1897, forwarding a copy of the rules in
?164 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. force on the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway for the disin- fection of a carriage used by a person suffering from a contagious disease. You say that these rules apply in the case of persons suffering from bubonic plague, and that they are considered adequate. 2. Rule 10 (f) of the rules in question provides that "when evacuations, etc., of the infected person have contaminated the floor or seats of a carriage, but not otherwise, it should be washed with carbolic acid solution, consisting of a wineglassful of carbolic acid mixed in a gallon of boiling water." This rule falls far short of the rules in force on other railways (for instance, the North-Western Railway, the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, and the Indian Midland Railway), which provide that when a carriage is being disinfected every portion of the woodwork must be washed over with boiling water, containing in each gallon a wineglassful of carbolic acid. It is obviously insufficient to wash the floors and seats only when they have been contaminated by evacuations, etc. Moreover, it appears from the rules in force on the Bombay, Boroda and Central India Railway that a carriage occupied by a person suffering from bubonic plague may be again brought into use immediately the disinfection has been completed. 3. As the ordinary rules on the subject of disinfection of carriages in force on the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway do not adequately provide, in the opinion of the Sanitary Commissioner of these provinces, for an emergency such as the present, and as you ex- press no intention of adopting the precautions considered necessary by this Government, the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner, acting on the opinion of his professional advisers, and being satisfied, that the procedure adopted by your railway is dangerously insufficient, is constrained to issue orders which have the force of law on the sub- ject under Act No. III. of 1897 for observance by railway officials of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, serving in these provinces. I am to forward for your information a copy of the orders issued, and to say that spare copies will be supplied for distribution and for affixing to notice boards at the various railway stations. The Railway Company, which comes under the definition of the word "person" used in sections 2 and 3 of Act No. III of 1897, will be held responsible for the due observance of the orders, and I am now to call upon you to take effective measures to secure compliance with the orders on the part of subordinate officials. 4. I am to remark in conclusion that rule 10 (g) of the rules forwarded with your letter under reply, which lays down that when disinfectants are required, application should be made to the District
?APP..VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 165 Traffic Superintendent for them, is not sufficient, unless care is taken that a proper supply of disinfectants is kept at each station for use, whenever occasion may arise. Orders issued under Act No. III of 1897 (vide G. O. No. 136/XVI-404-D.-104, dated 8th March 1897). In exercise of the power conferred on this Government by Noti- fication No. 302, dated 4th February 1897, of the Governor General in Council, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and Chief Commissioner of Oudh is pleased to make the following orders under Act No. III of 1897 (an Act to provide for the better prevention of the spread of Dangerous Epidemic Diseases) for observance by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway Com- pany within the limits of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh:- 1. When a case of bubonic plague has been detected in a rail- way carriage, the carriage shall be disinfected in the manner provided in the rules dealing with ordinary contagious diseases. 2. In addition, carbolic acid powder shall be sprinkled on the floors and seats, or the interior woodwork of the carriages shall be thoroughly washed with a solution of perchloride of mercury (1 in 1,000) or with, a carbolic acid solution (a wineglassful to a gallon). 3. The doors and windows shall then be thrown open, and the carriage kept in a siding unused for ten days. 4. A sufficient supply of disinfectants shall be kept at all stations. No. 98.

The Government of India have had under consideration the advisability of cleansing all vehicles conveying passengers and their
?166 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. luggage from districts affected with the bubonic plague to other parts of India, and are of opinion that the disinfection of all such vehicles is absolutely necessary as a precautionary measure against the spread of infection. 2. For this purpose it is considered imperative that vehicles in which suspected or declared cases of plague have occurred should be stopped at, and not allowed to run further than, either the station at which such cases are removed from the carriage or the nearest medi- cal inspection station,-preferably the former if the process of disin- fection can be promptly and satisfactorily carried out there,-while non-suspect vehicles should be disinfected at the medical inspection station nearest to the boundary of infected areas. This need involve  no detention to the latter beyond that necessary for their actual dis- infection, the inspection of the occupants and the disinfection of their baggage. 3. The Government of India accordingly desire that, subject to the foregoing remarks, the Administration (s) of the railway(s) under the control of the Government of /your control be requested to disinfect all vehicles conveying passengers and their baggage from areas infected with the bubonic plague in the following manner :- (a) Vehicles in which cases of plague have not been detected- Third and intermediate class carriages, goods, vehicles carry- ing passengers and luggage vans.-The interior woodwork, espe- cially the floors and seats, to be thoroughly washed with a solution of perchloride of mercury (1 in 1,000), or with a carbolic acid solution (a wineglassful to a gallon) applied with a mop ; the doors and windows to be opened and the vehicles exposed to the air, First and second class carriages.-The floors and woodwork to be treated as above, the cushions being also brushed and thoroughly cleaned. (b) Carriages in which cases of plague have been detected- (i) These, after being detached from the train, should be thoroughly washed with soft soap and lime-water. After an interval of two or three hours this should be washed off with plain water, and then the following disinfecting solution should be thoroughly sprayed all over the interior as well as the exterior of carriages by means of a syringe :- Corrosive sublimate  oz. Hydrochloric acid 1 OZ. Water 3 gallons.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 167 This solution should be allowed to dry on the carriages. Special care must be taken to direct the solution into all the cracks and crevices and jilmils. (ii) After disinfection, the carriages should be kept out in the open for 48 hours. They can then be brought into use again. (iii) In the case of first and 2nd class carriages, which afford greater facilities than third class compartments for the harbouring of plague germs, it will be necessary, if the carriages are contaminated, to burn the cushions and to disinfect the woodwork in the manner indicated above, and re-paint the interior. (iv) Any compartment in which a suspicious case has travelled should be sprayed with the above disinfecting solution before being allowed to proceed. No. 99.

From-The Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Prov- inces and Oudh, Judicial Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Please see my letter No. 172 of I7th March, forwarding copy of orders issued under Act III of 1897 for disinfecting in these provinces infected carriages of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. Similar orders were issued in cases of East Indian and Bengal and North-Western Railways. Other railways voluntarily issued similar rules. At instance of this Government His Honour was advised by sanitary experts that it was necessary for infected carriages to be kept unused for ten days. Lieutenant-Governor now finds that Govern- ment of India in Public Works Department letter No. 349-R. T., dated 21st April 1897, have issued instructions for disinfection which will supersede orders issued by this Government under the Act in particular. Disuse for 48 hours only is prescribed.

From-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Public Works Department, Railway Branch, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Public Works Depart- ment. With reference to your letter No. 349-R. T., dated 21st April 1897, I am directed to forward, for the consideration and orders of the Government of India, an extract of a report by the General Traffic Manager, Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company, No. 2136, dated 12th May 1897, bringing to notice certain difficulties on that railway in carrying out the orders contained in your letter quoted above. 2. The infected area for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway ends at Manmad Junction on the North-East and Dhond Junction on the South-East line and the medical inspection stations nearest to these on the boundaries of this Presidency are Bhusawal and Hotgi Junctions. 3. It must be understood that on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway if any carriage is found to have a case of plague in it or a suspicious case, it is at once cut off the train, and disinfected, in accordance with the rules, so that the train, at any time, consists of carriages of which there is no reasonable suspicion that they contain or have contained persons suffering from plague. 4. I am accordingly to ask if, in the opinion of the Government of India, all practicable and reasonable security will not be given- (a) if every carriage, in which a suspicious case is found, is at once cut off and disinfected ; and (b) every carriage, in which no such case has been found, is disinfected at the end of its journey. This it appears would give practical security whilst it would obviate the difficulties and delays that the present orders must cause, 5. As regards the other point raised, i. e., the burning of cush- ions and repainting the interior of first and second class carriages, paragraph 3 (b) (iii) of your letter. This is understood to apply only to carriages in which persons who are undoubtedly suffering from
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 169 plague had been travelling. Such cases would be exceedingly rare, and unless on medical inspection the passengers were found to be actually suffering from plague and were in consequence removed from the train, their detection would be practically impossible. I am to say that this Government of course understands that in issuing this order the Government of India were probably acting on expert advice; but I am to ask that this matter may be reconsidered. Railway cushions in India besides being often, if not generally fix- tures, are almost always covered with leather, universally so on the lines under the control of this Government, and they are also in general very dry. They are accordingly most unlikely to harbour plague germs and their destruction whilst a very costly measure and one which would render useless for a considerable time the carri- age to which they pertained, would apparently be productive of little real benefit. Extract paragraphs 1 to 6 and 8 from a letter No. 2163, dated 12th May 1897, from the General Traffic Manager, to Agent, Great Indian Peninsula Rail- way. With reference to the Resolution of the Bombay Government, No. 1207 of the 27th ultimo, as to the disinfection of all vehicles conveying passengers and their luggage from districts affected with the plague into other parts of India, copy of which you sent me under your memorandum No. B.-18-6560 of the 5th instant, I beg to point out that if the Resolution is carried out as it at present stands, it will disorganise the whole of the passenger train service. We cannot, for want of sufficient spare stock, keep spare trains at the places where the disinfection of all vehicles and of the luggage, whether they have contained a case of plague or not, has to be done. It is to be understood, I presume, that parcels are included in the term luggage. If the latter requires to be disinfected, the former certainly does also. 2. If we have to keep trains standing at the station until they and the passengers and their baggage and the parcels have been disinfected, very considerable delay will result. As you are aware, when a heavy mail steamer comes in, we have on occasion to run as many as three and sometimes four mail trains to the North-East line and two to the South-East line, and these require almost the whole of one available upper class stock, so that it would be impossible for us to have spare trains into which to trans- fer passengers, and therefore the trains will have to be delayed while they are being disinfected, which, in the case of many of them, will be late at night, during which passengers will have to remain on the C 22
?170 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. platforms, and, more especially in the monsoon, it will, I am sure, lead to great delay and much inconvenience to passengers. 3. I have also to draw attention to the third section of clause 6 of paragraph 3 in which the following appears:- "In the case of first and second class carriages, which afford greater facilities than third class compartments, for the harbouring of plague germs, it will be necessary, if the carriages are contaminated, to burn the cushions, and to disinfect the woodwork, in the manner indicated above, and to repaint the interior." It would seem that this is a very serious matter if we are requir- ed really to carry it out. I dare say the Locomotive Superintendent will have something to say as to this order to burn cushions and repaint the interior of carriages in which plague cases have been detected. But I may point out that the cushions are not in all cases loose, but are really padded backs, and in some cases padded seats, so that it means that the carriages will have to be dismantled by competent workmen, who will have to be employed for the purpose, at the place where the disinfection has to be done. 4. I have not issued any orders at present, and for the reason that I am of the opinion that what is asked is practically impossible and because I hope you will be able to ask Government to reconsider the order. We must of course disinfect all carriages in which cases have been detected, but, while that is troublesome enough, it is what we do now, and have always done, since the plague began. The burn- ing the cushions and repainting the interior of first and second class carriages seems not to be really necessary. 5. With regard to the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Rail- way action in the matter, they are more favourably placed than we are. The whole of their broad-gauge line is in the infected area, and passengers have always to change, in consequence of the break of gauge, at Ahmedabad. I find that they have proposed that at that place, which is within the infected area, the passengers shall change into the disinfected trains. But the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway are in an essentially different position on account of the break of gauge, to that in which we are placed, and I believe that the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway will protest if they are required to disin- fect their trains, and change the passengers at any station other than Ahmedabad, for they will then be in somewhat the same posi- tion as we are.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 171 6. The Government of India say that the orders need involve no detention to the vehicles beyond that necessary for the actual disin- fection, the inspection of the occupants and the disinfection of their baggage. But it seems to have been overlooked that this will take, with a train of sixteen or eighteen or twenty vehicles, such a delay as will upset all possible hope of punctuality, and our trains will miss connection with those of other railways at junctions, and the confu- sion will be very great. The insides of the carriages are to be washed with the prescribed disinfectant applied with a mop, the doors and windows to be opened and exposed to the air. This with the disinfection of the baggage which must first be removed from the carriages, and the subsequeut drying of the interior of the carri- ages and return of the baggage, cannot be done in a little while as seems to be considered possible by the Government. The public will decidedly object to return into carriages which are wet with this not agreeable disinfecting prescription. The difficulty will be all the greater at night, when especially first and second class passengers will object to being turned out in, during the rains, the downpour which we frequently have to encounter, and which of itself will make the drying of the carriages a long process. These are not fanciful objections but are real difficulties. * * * * * * 8. I hope, however, that the Government of India may be pleased to modify the instructions. No. 102. Telegram No. 462-R.

In reply I am to say, in continuation of my telegram quoted in the margin, that having regard to the fact that the plague has materially abated and that the risk has consequently diminished in the infected area on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Government of India have no objection to the relaxation of the rules in question to the extent proposed in paragraph 4 (a) and (b) of your letter on the distinct understanding that, upon any recrudescence of the plague in virulent form, the rules which have been prescribed in the Government of India letter No. 349-R. T., dated the 21st April 1897, should be rigidly enforced in their entirety: I am however to point out that the proposal in paragraph 4 (a) corresponds with the procedure stated in paragraph 2 of Government of India No. 349-R. T., as being the preferable alternative. A refer- ence on this point, therefore, would seem to have been unnecessary. 3. With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter, I am to say that, as clearly shown under heading (b), the rule regarding the burning of the cushions and repainting the interior of first and second class carriages, contained in paragraph 3 (b) (iii) of the Government of India letter of the 21st April last, applies only to undoubted cases of plague, and the measures prescribed by the Government of India should be enforced whenever, in the opinion of a competent medical officer, the person removed from a carriage was suffering from plague. 4. In conclusion, I am to say that the Government of India notice that, as stated in paragraph 4 of the enclosure to your letter under reply, the orders contained in their letter No. 349-R. T., dated the 21st April last, have been held in abeyance up to the present, and I am to request that, with the permission of His Excellency the Governor in Council, very grave notice may be taken of this deli- berate disobedience of orders.

RESOLUTION.-The following rules applicable to quarantine at Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar have been communicated to the Super- intendents of those places with a request that copies might be posted up at the quarantine stations and other conspicuous places:- Public Notice. The following temporary regulations are prescribed by Government under Act III of 1897:- 1. The Chief Plague Authorities at Mahabaleshvar shall be the Superintendent and Mr. H. N. Alexander, and at Panchgani the Superintendent and Surgeon-Captain Bedford. 2.  All medical subordinates working under   their orders and all officers or persons specially appointed by them in writing shall be plague authorities for the purposes of those and all general rules under Act III of 1897. 3.  Quarantine camps shall be  established at or near Panchgani and  Mahabaleshwar by the Chief Plague Authorities of those places and shall be managed by the  Chief   Plague   Authorities   or  persons specially deputed   by them for the purpose.    Every person placed in quarantine shall be bound to reside in the quarantine  camp  assigned to him or her and to obey the regulations framed by the Chief Plague Authorities for that camp. 4.  All persons coming up from the plains by any road or path shall be quarantined unless either specially or generally exempted. 5.  The following is a list of persons generally exempted:- (1)  All Government servants travelling on duty. (2)  All servants  of   Europeans   who  produce   certificates from their employs or a medical man that- (a) they have been inoculated, or (b) they have been in good health for ten days previously and will on arrival be sent to the Superintendent, or other officer appointed by him for the purpose, for medical in- spection at such times as the Superintendent prescribes. (3)   All villagers in good health coming up from adjacent villages where there is no plague with supplies. (4)  All cart-drivers in good health, provided, however, that cart- drivers coming from Poona vi Wai shall,  with any  passen- gers in their carts, be quarantined. (5)  All drivers and syces in   good health belonging to public and private conveyances (drawn by horses or mules).

(7)   All Native gentlemen and their families   in  good health tra- velling in conveyances drawn by horses or mules and going either to hotels or bungalows. (The Superintendent shall have power to decide whether a house is a bungalow or not for the purposes of these rules). (8)  All well-known and respectable traders in good health. N B.-By "good health" is meant "free from plague  or reason- able suspicion thereof." 6.  Special exemption may be made by the   Chief Plague  Author- ities, who   shall have wide discretionary powers and will in exempt- ing people be guided chiefly by the  facilities   available, in view of the person's   position or rank and his or her place of residence, for keep- ing him or her under observation, for preventing the  concealment  of cases of plague amongst such persons; and for checking the spread of plague if a case or cases should occur. 7.  In making special  exemptions Chief Plague  Authorities  may attach conditions to the exemption.   All persons thus  exempted shall be bound to comply with those conditions. 8.  All persons generally exempted shall be bound, if ordered to do so by any Plague  authority,   to present   themselves for medical examination at the places and times prescribed by that authority and for such number of days after arrival as may be prescribed. 9.  All persons shall be bound, if called upon to do so,  to submit to medical examination by a Plague authority   who is a medical man, to answer truly any question   put by any Plague authority, as regards names, addresses, health, baggage, and places recently visited. 10.  No persons coming up from the plains shall wilfully evade quar- antine or inspection at the posts established for the purpose.    Quar- antine shall continue for such period not exceeding eight days as may be ordered in  each case by the Chief Plague  Authority in charge of the quarantine camp.    Should a case of plague occur at a quarantine camp, quarantine may continue for such further period  not exceed- ing eight days as the Chief Plague Authority may order. 11. Persons coming from Panchgani to Mahabaleshwar shall not on arrival be subjected to quarantine, unless there is, in the opinion of a Chief Plague Authority, reason to suppose that they have escap- ed quarantine or inspection at the former place. 12. All occupiers of houses or managers of hotels shall be bound, when called upon by the Superintendent of Mahabaleshwar or

As regards the other matters referred to, they seem to be sufficiently provided for in the rules published with Government Reso- lution No. 1728-1201-P., dated 29th March 1897. No. 105. No. 979, dated Mahableshwar, the 8th June 1897. From-H. N.  ALEXANDER, Esq.,  Superintendent of Police,  attached to the Secretariat, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. In obedience with instructions conveyed in paragraph 4 of Govern- ment Resolution No. 1496/955-B., dated 17th March 1897, I took charge of the duties of Chief Plague Authority at Mahableshwar on the 18th March 1897. These duties terminated on the 29th May. Under the rules in force few persons were prevented from entering Maha- bleshwar direct: persons admitted, however, were subject to daily inspection at the Civil Hospital until eight days had elapsed from the time they had left their home. It was really only persons over whom it would have been almost impossible to keep any real supervision, who had to finish their eight days in the observation camps before they were admitted into Mahableshwar. I have the honour to sub. mit a few remarks on the working of these rules. 2. General arrangements.-On taking charge I at once began making enquiries regarding all the possible ways by which people might get into Mahableshwar and wrote to the Superintendent of Police, Satara, for police. Mr. MacTie supplied me promptly with 2 jamadars, 3 naicks and 27 constables, and this force, together with 2 jamadars and 5 constables already present on plague duty, enabled me to establish what I considered would be an effective protection to Mahableshwar. In consultation with Surgeon-Major Monks I arranged as follows:- (a) The Chorpani Camp continued to work as it was doing when I took charge. This camp is situated 21/2 miles from Mahableshwar on the Satara Road. It was, when I took charge, being used by Surgeon-Major Monks as an observation camp. His intention was to use it as such until plague cases appeared when it was to be turned into a hospital camp. Surgeon-Major Monks had caused a camp to be erected at Machutra, 41/2 miles from Mahablesh- war on the Satara Road, which was to be used as the obser- vation camp, when Chorpani became the hospital camp.
?176                            Measures to prevent the               [ APP. VIII. (b) The Ling Mala Post, 3 miles from Mahableshwar on the Panchgani Road, started by Surgeon-Major Monks, was maintained. To this post, however, I added two out- posts, one on Kate's point road which commanded foot paths leading from the Krishna Valley and one, about a mile from the Ling Mala Post in the direction of Panch-  gani, which commanded a small though much-used foot- path leading into Mahableshwar. (c) I established a post at old Mahableshwar to prevent persons coming up from the Krishna Valley and thus getting into Mahableshwar. (d)  I enlarged   the   small post  at Metalya, 4  miles from Maha- bleshwar on the FitzGerald Ght road, started by Surgeon- Major Monks, and added two outposts, one at the head of a much-frequented jungle path leading from Wara to the FitzGerald Ght road and one at the place where the Par Ght path crosses the FitzGerald Ght road. (e)  Lastly I established a post near Babington point which  com- manded paths leading up from the Royana Valley. The jamadars placed by Surgeon-Major Monks in charge of Chorpani Camp and Ling Mala Post remained in their places and jamadars were appointed at Metalya and Babington Point. These jamadars were instructed to submit to me daily reports showing who had came to their posts and how they had disposed of them. The Babington Point Post had little to do, as the paths leading up from the Royana Valley are hardly good enough for pack carriage and in consequence only persons coming up with supplies passed by this way. Neither had the Me- talya Post much to do as few passengers came into Ma- hableshwar from the Konkan. There was, however, a good deal of cart traffic with which the post had to deal. The brunt of the work fell chiefly on the Ling Mala and Chorpani Posts. 3. Inspection at the hospital in Mahableshwar and personal su- pervision.-On receipt of daily reports above alluded to, I entered all the names of those persons admitted in Mahableshwar in a book which I sent to the hospital the first thing in the morning. This book was extremely simple. In it was entered the name of the person and his residence in Mahableshwar, the place he came from, the date he left that place, the date of his arrival in Mahableshwar, and the date of his arrival in Mahableshwar, and the date up to which he had to
?APP. VIII. ]                 spread of infection by land.                       177 present himself at hospital. This book was returned to me in the middle of the day, and at a glance I could see who had failed to at- tend for inspection. I then either wrote to the people pointing out that either they or their servants had failed to attend, or sent the police round to ascertain the cause for non-attendance. I had con- siderable advantage in this part of my work, as I know the place well and also most of the European residents, and further, being a police officer, the local police assisted me in every way doing their work extremely well. In order to get correct reports I had, how- ever, at first to inspect my two chief posts, Lingmala and Choar Pani, generally twice a day. This continued till I was satisfied that the jamadars really understood their work. After that and till the end I found that one inspection of these two posts daily was sufficient. My other posts I visited when I could find time. 4. Measures to prevent oppression by the Police.-Mahableshwar is to a great extent dependent for its supplies on the villagers who come up the hill daily and who had to pass my posts. I was much afraid that such persons might be interfered with by the police, and I therefore made a point of frequently conversing with these people and asking if they had any complaints to make. There were a few complaints at first, but I was now able to put a stop to any unnecessary interfer- ence by the police, and all complaints ceased which speaks well for the discipline maintained by the jamadars. 5.  Dandeghar observation Camp.-This camp which was close  to Panchgani was opened on the 2nd April.    It was the duty of the offi- cer in charge  to settle  who was to pass into Mahableshwar and who was to remain in the camp.    He issued red tickets to those who were to  enter   Mahableshwar,   yellow  tickets   to  those   who had been in quarantine and blue tickets to cartmen.    Surgeon-Major Monks and I came to the conclusion that it would be wise to keep the Ling   Mala Post as a further check first, in case the officer at Dandeghar   should make any mistake, secondly,   because   people   might   evade   Dande- ghar, and thirdly because it was easier to ascertain  the   names and addresses of people near at hand than  to be  dependent  on a   place so far off as Dandeghar for  the   information.    In every respect   the place worked well. 6.   Cart traffic.-Cartdrivers with carts were under the rules ad- mitted straight into Mahableshwar.    They were directed, however, to move away as soon as possible after they had completed  their busi- ness.    As an extra precaution all cartmen moving from   the Konkan to the Satara District and vice vers, and who did not wish   to  stop c 23
?178                       Measures to prevent the                    [ APP. VIII. in Mahableshwar, were escorted through and not allowed into the bazaar. Persons were escorted through in a similar manner if they did not wish to stop in Mahableshwar. 7.  Machutra   Camp.-This    camp   was first  used   on   the   31st March.    It became the observation camp and the jamadar in   charge of Chorpani took charge of it.      It  remained   in   use   till   quarantine arrangements were stopped on the 29th of May. 8.  Plague case.-Only one case of plague occurred.    On the 27th March a Marwari and two women arrived from Poona  and were sent to the observation camp at Chorpani.   One of the women was suffering from fever at the  time,  which  proved to be ordinary fever.    On the afternoon of the 30th the other woman got  fever.    I heard of this on the morning of the  31st and, finding  that the   temperature was un- usually high, came to   the  conclusion that it was  probably a case of plague though no glandular swellings were then observable. Surgeon- Major Monks and  I agreed that it would be unwise to run any risks, and we settled to move all the persons, over 70 in number, who were under observation in the camp, to the Machutra Camp. This, with the assistance of the chief constable, I   arranged for, and by the evening the Machutra Camp  was in working   order.    The two   sick   women and their relatives were kept at Chorpani  and strict quarantine was observed at both   camps.    The  woman died of plague the next day and her corpse was burnt just  outside the camp.    The inmates of the camp were   detained  for nine days, and I am  glad to say no further plague cases occurred. 9.   Cholera case.-There was one case of cholera in the Machutra Camp which ended fatally. A man arrived from the Satara direction on the I5th May suffering with cholera.    He was   detained and   treated and there appeared to be every hope that he would recover, when   he suddenly got relapse and died on the 21st idem. 10. Persons under observation.-About 870 persons were detain- ed in the observation camps and 2,200 attended at the hospital for periods varying from one to eight days. 11. Observation camps.-The two camps erected here consisted of grass huts. In the Chorpani Camp there were two long wards partitioned off into rooms with some separate huts for attendants. The Machutra Camp consisted of huts divided from one another by a con- siderable space. I consider the Machutra Camp far superior of the two for quarantine purposes, as in the case of an infectious disease being discovered in a hut it could be destroyed, whereas in the case of works this was impossible. The Chorpani Camp was constructed as
?APP. VIII. ]                   spread of infection by land.                      179 an hospital, and it might be argued that only persons suffering from infectious diseases would occupy the rooms. This may be, so that I can only say that it was a great satisfaction to me, as it would be I fancy to any one actually engaged in plague work, to see any place or thing suspected of harbouring microbes destroyed by fire. As regards the huts themselves I consider that the walls and roof should be double. It is cold at night on the Mahableswar Hills and these huts were decidedly draughty. Single-sided huts are hardly sufficient protection against wind or rain. Fearing rain towards the end of May we had the huts at Machutra double walled and roofed. Surgeon-Major Monks had erected an air-tight chamber at Chorpani Camp for fumigating purpose, and at both camps appliances for boiling clothes were available. A good deal of work in this connection was carried out. 12.  Dodges  resorted to  by  the public   to   avoid detention  in camp.-The police has to keep their eyes open at the post  as people tried  all   sorts  of  dodges  to  get  past   them  and thus avoid being detained in the camps. The public soon learnt the rules and the first dodge was to say that eight days had elapsed since the person had left his home. In these cases it generally fell to my lot to determine when they did leave their homes. Knowing that local villagers could not get by the post without trouble, people would appear at the post carrying a bundle of grass or sticks and pretend that they came from close by. One man, a darzee, came up in a carriage drawn up by two horses. As he appeared a bit confused when asked for his address, he was detained, and it turned out that he was simply going to the bazaar and had managed to get a seat in a phton from Wathar for Rs. 2 with two other persons who had paid Rs. 3 each. In the slack time the proprietors of carriages are glad to take anything. Nearly everyone who was stopped had a piteous tale to tell showing how absolutely necessary it was for him to get at once into Mahableshwar. The orders given to the jamadar were simple. When they were in doubt they were to detain and report to me. This they did willingly as it took the responsibility off their shoulders. 13.  Hospital Assistants.-The work done by the Hospital Assist- ants both at the Civil Hospital, where the daily inspection went on, and at the camps and posts, where they were in medical charge, was extremely good.    They gave me every help and worked most cheer- fully.
?180                     Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. 14. Police Officers.-I think it right here to ask for some recogni- tion of the services of the jamadars in charge of the Machutra, Ling Mala and Metalya Posts. The two former had exceedingly hard work which they did very well. The latter had less to do, but still he was in charge of an important post, and what he had to do he did well. The Hospital Assistants on this duty got an addition of Rs. 15 per mensem to their pay, and I should be glad if Government would grant the same to these jamadars. This work was very hard and was really of a very responsible character; it was further work where subordinates are liable to be tempted and to misuse the powers given -to them. To the best of my knowledge and belief these three men were perfectly straight in their dealings, and I have no hesitation in saying that they did their work most efficiently.

RISLEY, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Ben- gal, Financial Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 1542-Sanitary, dated the 2oth May 1897, regarding the precau- tions necessary to guard against the introduction of the bubonic plague into the districts of Orissa, I am directed to submit, for the consideration of the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a letter from the Commissioner of Orissa, No. 91-M., dated the 20th April 1897, with which this correspondence originated. 2. In paragraph 5 of his letter the Commissioner lays stress on the danger of plague being imported into Orissa by pilgrims coming from the Bombay Presidency to Puri during the ensuing Car festival and being eventually communicated to Calcutta which has a constant and large passenger traffic with Orissa. These pilgrims will come to Puri either by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Nizam's Railway and East Coast Railway vi Wadi and Kondapalli, or by the Southern Mahratta line and East Coast Railway vi Hotgi and Dharwar. The Bombay Government have intimated that inspections at Dhond on the Dhond and Manmad Section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway are about to be discontinued, and the Resident at Hyderabad reports that the Medical Staff employed on plague inspec- tion at Wadi, the junction of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway with the Nizam's Railway consists of two hakims, one lady doctor and two dressers. Unless, therefore, the Government of Bombay have inspections at Hotgi and Dharwar which command the approach to the Southern Mahratta Railway, there will, after the Dhond inspec- tions are stopped, be nothing to prevent people from coming round by that railway and evading inspection at Kondapalli. They would no doubt be inspected at Bezwada, but it appears from your telegram
?APP. VIII. ]        spread of infection by land.                       183 of the 20th instant that inspections at this place  are conducted  by  a Civil Apothecary alone and cannot therefore be fully relied on. 3.  The most   effective   means   of guarding against  the   dangers arising from the influx of Bombay pilgrims to Puri would undoubted- ly be to prohibit the sale within the Bombay Presidency and Sind   of railway tickets to Khurda Road and all  stations on   the   East Coast Railway between that place and Bezwada.     If the Bombay  pilgrims want to get to Puri in any other way than by the  routes   mentioned above, they must go round by Calcutta.    In that case they will   have to pass the Khana inspection station on the East Indian Railway which commands the approach from the Bengal-Nagpur Railway,   and   will take so long over  the  journey that the normal period of  incubation will have expired before they reach Calcutta. 4.  If the Government of India  accept  this  view of the  matter, I am to suggest that  the   accompanying  draft notification   which  is based   on   the   notification   recently   issued in the   case of  Hardwar should be published by the Government of India under the Epidemic Diseases Act.    The Lieutenant-Governor does not think it necessary that pilgrims from other   parts   of   India   should be prevented  from visiting Puri provided   that   pilgrimage  from  Bombay and  Sind   is restricted in the manner proposed. 5.  Meanwhile I am to add, with reference to the concluding lines of your telegram of the 11th instant, that the Commissioner of Orissa has been requested to draw up a  complete   scheme  for  forming  an observation camp in which the pilgrims arriving for  the   Rath  Jatra from the direction of   Bombay  will   be  segregated   and   kept   under observation for 10 days. No. 91-M., dated Cuttack, the 20th April 1897. From-H. G. COOKE, Esq., C.S., Commissioner of the Orissa Division, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal Department. Copies of the enclosures are not sent herewith. I have the honour to enclose copies of a  letter  from   the   Magis- trate of Cuttack and of its enclosure, a letter from the Civil Surgeon of Cuttack on the subject of precautions necessary to guard against the introduction into Cuttack and, I may add, into   Puri   and Calcutta of the bubonic plague. 2. Bombay is at present something over four days' journey by rail from Cuttack, and the only place where any precautionary mea- sures are taken at present is Bezwada on the East Coast Railway, about 36 hours' journey by rail from Cuttack. The adequacy of the
184                        Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. means taken at Bezwada may be gathered from the fact that the Civil Surgeon of Cuttack receives letters and telegrams calling attention to people by name who appear to the medical officer at Bezwada to be suspicious or doubtful. 3.  As to the danger of infection being introduced from Bombay to this place, the Superintending Engineer of  the   Bengal-Nagpur Rail- way assures me that many of his   principal  contractors   are  Suratis, and that from thence will come as   many  as   four  or  five  thousand masons who will be employed on  the   great  bridges  that are   to  be built across the Mahanadi and other large rivers near Cuttack. 4.  Should the disease develop in Cuttack, there is a very appreci- able risk of its being carried thence to Calcutta, as there   is  a  large population of Uriyas constantly  going  to   Calcutta for   employment and returning after they have saved a little money and being replaced by others,   so  that   the   stream   of   emigrants   is  constant   towards Calcutta. 5.  There is even a greater danger than this which arises from the pilgrims to Puri who  are   recruited   to  some extent  from   Bombay. Should the disease break out at the great Car festival   at  that   place when thousands of pilgrims assemble, it might  be   communicated   to any part of India by the pilgrims on their return journey.    Amongst other places, Calcutta would be liable to this danger as pilgrims from Puri might elect to return that way to visit other places of pilgrimage, such as Benares and   Hardwar,   for   it  is   a   common  practice   with pilgrims to visit several sacred places in a single tour. 6.  There is no doubt that Jatni or Khurda Road station, which   is where the Puri branch of the East   Coast  Railway  leaves  the   main line, is the best place for examining and detaining  suspicious   cases, and I do not think that it would be possible to   make  the  conditions too stringent, especially in view  of the   Car  festival  in  July  next. The Khurda Road station is about four days   by   rail   from   Bombay, and as the disease takes at least seven days and possibly twelve days to manifest itself, no half measures such as appear to be   adopted   at Bezwada are adequate. Draft Notification. Whereas the Governor General in Council is satisfied that there is danger of an outbreak of plague if persons residing or staying in the Bombay Presidency or Sind assemble at Puri to attend the Car festival in the present month of June and the ensuing month of July.

No. 1690, dated Simla, the 14th June 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the  Government  of  Bengal,   Municipal (Medical) Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 275- T. M., dated the 31st May 1897, regarding precautions to guard against the introduction of plague into Orissa, with special reference to the danger arising from the influx of pilgrims from the Bombay Presidency into Puri, to visit the temple of Jagannath and to be present at the Car festival. 2. I am to say that it appears to the Government of India that now that the virulence of the epidemic has diminished the danger of so much infection reaching Calcutta through Orissa has been greatly reduced. The Government of India also understand that the number of persons from the Bombay Presidency who perform the pilgrimage to Puri is not large. Under these circumstances it appears to the Government of India that there is not sufficient reason to adopt the extreme measure of prohibiting the sale within the Bombay Presi- dency and Sind of railway tickets to Khurda Road and all stations on the East Coast Railway between that place and Bezwada. The pre- caution would also not be completely effectual since intending pilgrims c 24

The Government of India notice that the Commissioner of Orissa has been requested to draw up a complete scheme for forming an observation camp in which the pilgrims arriving for the Car festival from the direction of Bombay will be segregated and kept under observation for ten days, and it appears to them that this precaution combined with the usual pre- caution of inspection at certain places on the journey will be suffi- cient to guard against the danger. 3.  With regard to the subject of the inspection of the pilgrims on the journey.    The route vi the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Nizam's State Railway and the East Coast Railway is guarded by the first class inspection station at Hotgi and by the inspection station at Kondapalli, the arrangements  at  which   were   communicated  to  the Government of Bengal in my telegram No. 1542, dated the 20th May 1897.    The alternative and circuitous route   vi the   Southern  Mah- ratta Railway is   guarded   by  the   first   class   inspection   station   of Guntakal in the Madras Presidency, and as an   additional  precaution the  Government of   Madras  have   been   requested   to   increase   the strength of the inspection staff at Bezwada and to appoint a Commis- sioned Medical Officer to the place. 4.  In conclusion I am to say that the   Government  of  India  will be glad to receive in due course an account  of   the working  of  the observation camp to be established for  the   segregation   of   pilgrims coming from the direction of Bombay.    They would also  be  glad   to learn, in order to communicate   the  information  to   the   Government of Madras, over what dates the period of the Car festival will extend. No. 115.

THE SINGHAST MELA. Telegram No. 3580, dated Indore, the 10th April 1897.                        From-The Agent to the Governor-General, Indore, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. A religious fair, known as the Singhast Mela, is held once in twelve years at Ujjain and is usually attended by three or four hundred thousand, chiefly Sadhus and mendicants, from all parts of India. The period for this fair is from the 17th April to the 16th May 1897, the dates given being those of the full moon in months Cheth and Basakh. Arrangements were being made more than a year ago for the great influx of people expected at Ujjain, but, in October 1896, when famine threatened, Maharaja Sindhia issued orders prohibiting the Singhast Mela at Ujjain, and notices where printed by His Highness and for- warded to me for wide circulation. I sent copies in November 1896 to all Local Governments and Administrations and to all Railways in India, and reminders were sent in March 1897. In spite of all precautions, about fifteen thousand Sadhus have arrived from all parts of India, and it is impossible to prevent them from going to Ujjain. I have therefore in consultation with Sarsoobah of Malwa and with Sindhia's consent, arranged that these Sadhus shall bathe on 17th April in Sipra at Ujjain under strict rules as to encampment outside city, sanitary arrangements and promises of leaving Uj- jain on 18th April. These terms have been agreed to by the Mahants of each sect, who have bound themselves to enforce obedience of all their followers. It is most important that no more Sadhus or other mendicants shall be allowed to leave their homes or to travel towards Ujjain at present. No epidemic exists, but I cannot too earnestly urge the danger of situation if further gathering between 17th April and 16th May is permitted. I trust Government of India will move all Administrations and Local Governments to issue stringent

Yesterday the Rajputana- Malwa Railway are reported to have booked 400 from Rutlam and 1,000 from Barnagar to Ujjain, and Great India Peninsula Railway on 8th April booked 300 from Burhanpur. It must be understood that when Sindhia prohibited fair being held, all arrangements for water-supply, food, sanitary arrangement, etc., were stopped, and it is now impossible to meet requirements of more than the limited numbers now at Ujjain.

It is understood   from   your 3580,  April 10th, that the original   prohibition by   Maharaja Sindhia of the Singhast Mela was determined on account of scarcity and that present anxiety to prevent gathering in spite of prohibition arises from danger of epidemic.    Is this  accurate and   has   Maharaja adopted in

It seems desirable that Maharaja should take action indicated within his dominions before Government of India are asked to assist by taking action which is perhaps not au- thorised by ordinary law. No. 127. Telegram No. 3744, dated Indore, the 14th April 1897. From-The Agent to the Governor General, Central India, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Your telegram No. 1392, April fourteenth. The original prohibi- tion by Maharaja Sindhiaof the Singhast Mela was determined when it became clear that scarcity threatened; but danger of epidemic breaking out was always contemplated and was included in reasons for prohibition; the danger is not limited to Gwalior territory, for if epidemic disease appears amongst pilgrims at Ujjain, it will be im- possible to prevent its dissemination to those parts of India from which the pilgrims come and to which they will return; this is chief cause of my anxiety and of my request that Sadhus may not be allowed to pass through British districts on the way to Ujjain. Sindhia has adopted in Malwa measures analogous to provi- sions of Epidemic Diseases Act. The Mela at Ujjain is being con- trolled from point of view of epidemic; the last Singhast Mela in 1885 resulted in outbreak of cholera when deaths among pilgrims were estimated at twenty thousand and fourteen thousand deaths occurred among residents of town of Ujjain.

I have the honour to address you in continuation of my telegram No. 3580 of the 10th April 1897, regarding the Singhast Mela at Ujjain. 2. In the early part of 1896, very elaborate arrangements were made for the management of the large crowd that always attends this festival. In October 1896, however, in consequence of the impending famine and the increased danger to health which such a gathering would entail in these -circumstances, the Maharaja Sindia, at my suggestion, definitely decided to prohibit this Mela. Notices announcing this decision were accordingly issued by the Gwalior Darbar in English, Hindi, Urdu and Marathi, and distributed

The notice was as follows:- "Notice is hereby given that owing to the want of sufficient rain- fall and consequent failure of crops and great scarcity, the Singhast Fair, which was to be held in 1897 at Ujjain, has been stopped. "Should any pilgrims, in spite of this prohibition, arrive at Ujjain, they will not be allowed to stop there under any circumstances." 3. On the 2nd March 1897 a case of bubonic plague was discovered at the Ujjain Railway station, and thereupon I issued the accom-                         panying notice to  the Railway   Administrations Enclosure A. above mentioned, to all the   Political Agents in Central India for the issue of suitable instructions to the States in their political charge, to the States that are directly under my own political charge, viz., Indore, the Dewas States, and Bagli, to all Cantonment Magistrates and Officers Commanding Local Corps in Central India, to the Agent to the Governor-General in Rajputana for such action as he might consider necessary, and to all Railway Station Masters between Khandwa and Ujjain, between Ujjain and Rutlam, between Ujjain and Bhopal, between Rutlam and Neemuch. Of the Indore Darbar I requested to be informed at a very early date what measures they had decided to take in the matter, and I suggested that they should take steps to turn back at the limits of Indore territory mendicants and pilgrims travelling along the Khandwa- Indore and Agra-Bombay roads. The Indore Darbar has, however, never replied to, nor taken any notice of, my requests and sug- gestions, until a few days ago when the evil had assumed dimensions which were and are beyond control, as will appear from what follows. The Agents of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway, of the East Indian Railway, and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway assured me that the necessary instructions had been issued along those lines. 4. The Sar Subah of Ujjain had, on the 6th March last, arranged to have all arrivals at Ujjain turned out as they came in. He also informed me that the Subahs of the different districts had been instructed to turn back all large assemblages of Bairagis and Gosains on their way to Ujjain. At the same time he told me that several thousand Sadhus and the like had assembled at Indore with the express object of making a simultaneous rush on Ujjain when the time came.
192 Measures to prevent the                     [ APP. VIII. Both the Dewas States cordially assisted me and took effective measures to prevent the influx of pilgrims to Ujjain. Beyond this I have had no response to the endeavours I have made to prevent & gathering of Sadhus and others at Ujjain. 5. The information   about the collection of  Sadhus at Indore was quite correct, and, on the 23rd March last, having made several verbal communications on the subject to the Indore Minister and the Indore Enclosure B.          Vakil, I sent  a copy of the accompanying kaifiat from the Gwalior Vakil  to   the   Indore   Darbar and formally   requested   to be   informed what   measures   the   Indore Darbar had taken   or intended to take to prevent a sudden  influx of mendicants, pilgrims  and others   into Ujjain.    Receiving no answer but hearing that the Maharaja Holkar  was entertaining  and feasting Enclosure  C.           these Sadhus, I   addressed,   on   the 25th March last,   the   accompanying   letter  to  the   Indore Vakil. Enclosure D. Enclosure E. On the 26th   March,  I   sent  the   accompanying  telegram  to the Chief Commissioner, Central Provinces, to which I have not yet received any reply. On the 29th March, I heard from the Indore Vakil that orders had been received from the Maharaja Holkar " to disperse by force, if necessary, the whole assemblage of Sadhus and mendicants here, with the exception of one superior order of Sadhus who, however, do not number many." The Vakil added that " the Darbar now hopes to clear the town of these immigrants without delay." Finding that these orders were not only not carried out but that the number of Sadhus was steadily increasing, on   the   5th  April   I   addressed  the Indore Vakil in a demi-official   letter  No. 3363. Meanwhile I continued to make urgent verbal representations to the Minister and the Vakil of Indore, and on the 7th April, finding that nothing had been done, I again wrote an urgent reminder to the Vakil. 6. As the matter was becoming very urgent, I telegraphed to the Sar Subah of Ujjain to come to Indore and sent for the leading Mohants among the Sadhus, and on the night of the 9th instant at a personal interview, arranged with them the conditions specified in the accompanying telegram to the Resident at Gwalior. To these Enclosure F.          arrangements the Maharaja Sindia has given his consent and has issued the necessary in- structions to the Sar Subah of Ujjain. The Mohants have given assurances in writing that they will abide by these conditions, and trust that no harm may result from their presence at Ujjain.
193 APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 7. I found it impossible to insist on the Sadhus not going to Ujjain, because they had become very numerous, were intensely fanatical and determined to go to Ujjain at all hazards, and because 300 armed Sadhus had lately arrived from Burhanpore in the Central Provinces and others equally armed had left Rutlam for Ujjain. In these circumstances I thought the compromise I have made with the concurrence of the Maharaja Sindia was the most advisable in the circumstances, and I trust the Government of India will agree with me, 8. I am constrained to call attention to the apparent disregard of all the notices and warnings I have issued by those to whom they were addressed with the exception of the Officers and States in Central India. The Government of India are aware of the highly religious and even superstitious character of the Maharaja Holkar, and judged by his owe standards, it would hardly be reasonable to blame him for hesitating to encounter the terrors of ex-communication or the odium of the religious bodies who still have so much power in India. Enclosure A. Notice issued by the Agent to the Governor General in Central India on the 3rd March 1897. A fakir was found yesterday (2nd March 1897) at the Ujjain Railway station suffering from the plague (bubonic fever); he had come from Onkarnath on the Narbudda. It is probable that many mendicants and others will be coming to Ujjain from Bombay and other plague-stricken places; you are there- fore reminded that the Singhast Mela at Ujjain has been absolutely prohibited this year by the Maharaja Sindia, who has given strict orders that should any pilgrim, in spite of this prohibition, arrive at Ujjain, they will not be allowed to stop there under any circum- stances. I am directed to ask you to do all in your power to prevent such pilgrims coming to Ujjain and to co-operate to the best of your ability with the local authorities in their endeavours to stop any such influx into Ujjain. Enclosure B. Abstract translation of a kaifiat, No. 83, dated the 13th March 1897, from the Gwalior Darbar Vakil to the address of the First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General in Central India. I have received a kh\ill\t dated the 9th March 1897, from the Subah of Ujjain which is to the following effect, c 25
?194 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. The Singhast fair has been stopped this year. Strict orders have been issued to the police not to allow the Sadhus to enter Ujjain. The approaches to Ujjain and the halting places and the assemblage grounds are very strictly guarded. The Lambardars, Patwaris, and Chaukidars of all villages have been warned not to allow Sadhus to stop in their villages or proceed towards Ujjain, but to persuade them to return. Orders have also been issued to turn out any Sadhus who might have come secretly by other routes than recognised thorough- fares. A Sub-Inspector has been posted at the Ujjain station to see that the Sadhus and Fakirs who come by rail are made to go back. The result of all these precautions is seen in the fact that no Sadhu who has come from Maffassil to join in the fair can be seen at Ujjain. But it has been heard that the Sadhus and Fakirs of Indore and Dewas and of Indore and Dewas villages which adjoin Ujjain are awaiting to come to Ujjain to join in the fair. Some of these Sadhus have come by rail in twos and fours. It would be much better if steps were taken to stop this (in-coming) through the Illakadars and the railway officials. I beg to submit this kaifiat for orders and necessary action. Enclosure C. No. 3019, dated Indore Residency, the 25th March 1897. Demi-official from-CAPTAIN L. S. NEWMARCH, First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor General, Central India, To-The Residency Vakil, Indore. The Agent to the Governor General has learnt that two deaths occurred on the 23rd March among the Sadhus collected at Indore. I am to ask whether any report has been received by the Darbar of these deaths, and if so, what disease is reported to be the cause of death. It appears that, in spite of orders and warnings to the contrary, over 4,000 of these mendicants are still encamped at or near Indore, and it is said that these persons intend to visit Ujjain. The Darbar should clearly understand that the responsibility of allowing these mendicants to remain at Indore rests entirely upon them, and that they will be held answerable to the Government of India for any out- break of illness that may occur. The Singhast Mela at Ujjain has been positively prohibited by His Highness the Maharaja Sindia, and the entry of any pilgrims will most certainly be prevented (by force if necessary) into the city. In these circumstances the Agent to the Governor-General calls upon the Darbar to take immediate and effective measures for dispersing this assemblage of mendicants, which is certainly a source of great danger-during the present season and

From-The Agent to the Governor General in Central India, To-The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. Maharaja Sindia has, by proclamation issued last September, and recently repeated, prohibited the Singhast Mela at Ujjain which was to have taken place at end of April 1897. Notices have been sent to all States and to Railway authorities. In spite of prohibition large numbers of Sadhus continue to arrive at Indore from Onkar Mandhata and other places in Central Provinces. I shall be much obliged if you will kindly issue orders preventing Sadhus and other classes of mendicants from leaving Central Provinces for Ujjain. There are at present four thousand mendicants congregated at Indore, most of whom have come from Onkar and four hundred arrived here yesterday. Enclosure E. No. 3363, dated Indore Residency, the 5th April 1897. Demi-official from-CAPTAIN L. S. NEWMARCH, First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor General, Central India, To-The Darbar Vakil, Indore. I am desired to refer you to the correspondence ending with Colonel Barr's demi-official letter No. 3135, dated the 29th March 1896, and to ask you to be good enough to report whether the orders passed by His Highness the Maharaja for the immediate dispersal of the Sadhus congregated in the Indore City have been carried out, and also whether these Sadhus have left the city. I am again to request that you will let these men clearly under- stand that they will not be permitted on any account to enter the city of Ujjain or indeed to pass into His Highness the Maharaja Sindhia's territory. Enclosure F. Telegram No. 3550, dated Indore Residency, the 9th April 1897. From-The Agent to the Governor-General in Central India, To-The Resident at Gwalior. In spite of all precautions and prohibitions regarding Singhast Mela at Ujjain, at least fifteen thousand Sadhus will certainly go to

They agree to go under control of Gwalior Darbar officials under following arrangements, namely, to arrive Ujjain on evening of Sunday next, April 11th, to encamp outside city, and stay there until 18th April, on which day they bind themselves to leave and to disperse to their homes. They wish to bathe at the Ghats on 17th April, and after bathing to go to Angapat and Mahankal, but on distinct promise of leaving city that evening. I have discussed these arrangements with Onraet and the Subah of Ujjain, and I am of opinion that under the peculiar circumstances of the case no other or better arrangements can be made. Please explain this fully to Maharaja and ask him to give his consent and to issue necessary orders by urgent wire to Sar Subah at Ujjain. No. 129. No. 1309, dated Simla, the 17th April 1897.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1197- I.-A. of 26th March 1897, and to communicate the following remarks on the subject of the proposed measures against the exportation of plague from the Punjab into Afghanistan. 2.  In the first place Mr. Young desires to  draw   attention   to the fact that, notwithstanding the occasional importation   of  the   disease by travellers from Bombay and Sind,  there   have   up to   the   present time been no local cases of plague in the Punjab, with the exception of two which took place at Delhi some months ago in the house occu- pied by a recent arrival from Bombay who was himself infected. 3.  The province is protected by a system of inspection at  railway stations, ferries and road posts, of the general character of  which  the Government of India are already aware.   In addition to the inspection of   travellers   alighting   from   the   trains   at   a   large   number   of stations which include   all district head-quarters and   all cantonments on or near the line of railway and   all   terminuses   for   hill   stations, there are special inspections, at which all passengers are examined at certain points which have been so selected as to   enable   the work  to be done by   daylight.     Passengers   from   Sind   are   all  inspected   at Khanpur or at some neighbouring station, the actual place of  inspec- tion being varied from time to time to provide against the   practice of evading inspection   by marching   across   country.    All intermediate and third class passengers are now detained for 24 hours at Khanpur, in order to undergo the disinfection   of  their clothes   and   personal
?198 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. effects, and an Assistant Commissioner has been placed on special duty there to superintend the arrangements. A second line of defence against the danger from Sind is provided by inspection of all passengers either at Sher Shah or at Raiwind, all passengers of the Sind-Sagar line being inspected at the former place. Passengers from the Bombay direction by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India line undergo inspection either at Bhatinda or at Ferozepore according to the train by which they arrive, while those travelling by the East Indian Railway, after undergoing inspection at Ghaziabad in the North-Western Provinces, are again inspected either at the junction of Wazirabad or at Jhelum, according to the train by which they arrive. 4.  Passengers up to the Indus from Sind are stopped at the ferry of Mithankot and there examined.    Entry into   the   Dera   Ghazi   Khan district from Sind or from the Native State of Bhawalpur,   which lies on the opposite side of the   Indus,   is   prohibited, otherwise   than   by way of Mithankot or Rojhan, a road inspection  post   situated  at the extreme south of the district. 5.  A record is kept by the  police of all arrivals from the   infected provinces, and particular attention is paid to deaths occurring among such persons with a view to immediate   detection of cases of plague. It has been made legally incumbent   upon   certain persons  including village officials, householders and seraikeepers to   report   at once all arrivals from infected provinces and all suspicious  cases of disease. The District Magistrate and any 1st class Magistrate  or Commission- ed Medical Officer, to whom he may delegate   the   power,   has   legal authority to remove a plague patient   to hospital,   and   to   destroy or disinfect any building which he   has   occupied.    Many minor matters have also been provided for by Regulations issued   under the   Epide- mic Diseases Act, 1897, and it is believed that such machinery as  can be provided exists for the discovery and stamping out of the  disease as soon as it shows itself. 6.  So long as the Punjab is free from the disease, the protection of Afghanistan will be as efficiently secured by the measures adopted on the East and South frontiers of the province as by any special arrange- ments on the North and West frontiers.   Every effort is being made to detect cases which may be imported across the former frontiers, and if this province does not receive the infection it will not pass it on.    If unhappily the   Punjab or   any   part   of   it becomes an infected area, then the   Lieutenant-Governor  thinks   that apart from any measures which maybe taken for  dealing  with   such an area, it may be neces- sary in pursuance of the orders of the Government of India expressed in  their  letter under reply to establish an inspection cordon for the
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 199 special protection of Afghanistan. The detention in the province of all persons intending to go to Afghanistan would, in His Honour's opinion, be impossible, and for reasons similar to those given in your telegram No. 935, dated the 13th of March 1897, about quarantine on the southern border, impolitic; but it would be only right that our line of defence should be shifted behind the invaded area. Mr. Young suggests that we should await the development of events before deciding precisely what line to take up in such a case. As an ultim- ate resort the establishment of an inspection cordon at the ferries on the Indus (which could be made fairly effective owing to the rising of the river which must already have begun), or even the establishment of inspection posts at each of the principal passes into Afghanistan may be adopted, though it is manifest that either measure will if we have the plague upon us, most seriously tax the resources of the province and the latter alternative would afford but little prospect of success. 7.   Meanwhile the   inspection  of  all   persons alighting from the railway at  Peshawar,   Attock,   Khusalgarh,   Kundian,   Darya Khan, Ghazi Ght, combined with the measures taken at Khanpur, Sher Shah and Raiwind on the   North-Western   system  and   at stations on the Eastern and Southern frontiers, affords as good a prospect as can for the present be devised for preventing the exportation of plague  cases from the Punjab to Afghanistan. 8.   As regards  the   pilgrims from Nasik,   to   whom reference is made in your letter under  reply,   it   is understood that they have all dispersed.    An enquiry has been   addressed   to the Deputy Commis- sioner, Peshawar, on the subject, and the facts will be communicated to the Government of India when his reply is received. No. 132.  Extract from a letter from His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan,   to His Excel- lency the Viceroy, dated the 8th April 1897. As regards necessary precautions for the prevention of the plague, Your Excellency writes that we should endeavour to guard against the plague spreading from one place to another, and that if the plague should appear, which God forbid, in Afghanistan, I should inform Your Excellency with the least possible delay, so that with the aid of doctors measures might be taken to stamp out the disease. My kind friend, the proper measures are those which have been under- taken both by the illustrious British Government and myself, under which travellers are detained for a certain fixed number of days at each post and kept under observation, so that any person affected with this disease may not go from one country to another. But as everything lies in the hands of the Supreme Creator, I am offering prayers to Him that His   Exalted   Majesty may remove the
?200 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. life-destroying calamity from all countries of the world, so that all the creatures of God may remain safe from it. By the grace of God up to the present no sign of the disease has appeared in this country. But if it is predestined to appear here- after, the best thing would be to seek the grace and kindness of the Supreme Doctor. It has not been heard as yet that, under the treat- ment of the existing doctors, even five per cent. of the persons afflicted by such a disease have recovered. On the contrary I have heard that, with the exception of their burning the clothes and houses of the afflicted persons, they have not been able to administer any other remedy. Consequently, under these circumstances, it is better to invoke the aid of God by praying for His grace and kindness. REGULATIONS ENFORCED IN PERSIA. NO. 133. Translation of Rules regarding Sanitary posts to be  established on  the  frontiers N of  Afghanistan  and Baluchistan by Command of His Majesty Muzaffar-ud- Din Shah. (His Majesty the Shah) actuated by his Royal favour and kindness towards the subjects of the high Government of Persia hereby issues stringent orders that in addition to the steps already taken at the Persian Gulf ports for the prevention of the spread of plague from India to Persia the following measures shall also be adopted :-All along the frontier of Afghanistan and Baluchistan sanitary posts shall be established as detailed below :- (1)   On the frontiers of Afghanistan.-His Majesty the  Shah-in- Shah issues stringent orders that all roads, passages, mountain passes and paths shall be closed by means of troops-infantry and cavalry- with the exception of- I.-The main road coming northward from Herat to Meshed. II.-And the other main road  between   Kandahar   and   Birjand coming southward to Kirman and Yezd,  which   shall   re- main open. (2)   On the frontier  of Baluchistan.- Although  guarding  this part of the country is comparatively difficult, yet in   consideration   of the comparatively small traffic it is   not  very  important.    A   strong sanitary post shall be established on the road coming from   Baluchis- tan to Bampur and Bam, and a   number  of   Karawals   (guards)   and Karasuran (patrols) shall then take great care that not   a single soul shall cross except by this road, all other small roads being  closed.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 201 On each of these three roads which shall remain open, sanitary posts, consisting of cavalry, infantry and doctors, with all requisites, such as medicines and other things, etc., shall be established in Persian territory, and travellers and merchandise passing through those places shall be carefully inspected and examined, and, in case of necessity, placed under quarantine. Sanitary Posts. (1) Establishment of sanitary posts.-Sanitary posts shall be established at places near drinking water either in gardens or tents at least a thousand metres from dwelling houses or villages. Each sanitary post shall consist of the following officials:- I.-One head of department with officers and soldiers required for carrying out orders and looking after affairs. II.-Two doctors-one for inspection and examination of travel- lers and the other for the treatment of patients infected with plague in case of necessity. III.-Persons in attendance for carrying out the orders of doctors. The head of the sanitary posts and the doctors attached to his department shall be personally responsible for performing their duties properly and with great care. Especially the head of the sanitary post shall take care that the doctors perform their duties properly, carefully inspect and examine travellers and do not act against law in case they should be placed under quarantine or in case of merchandise being allowed to pass the sanitary post; similarly that different parties of travellers in the order of their arrivals be separated from each other, and those suffering from or suspected of being infected with the disease be formed into separate groups and not located with each other. The head of the sanitary post and the chief doctor shall submit separately a weekly report of their work containing an account of daily occurrences, numbers of travellers and patients and persons placed under quarantine to the Governor, who shall forward it to the Minister concerned. The articles necessary to be procured and kept ready at each sanitary post are as follows:- I.-A special tent for each head (of sanitary post) and other tents for troops and others. II.-A tent for storing medicines and articles necessary for disinfection, III.-A lazaretto divided into three different sets of tents (the number of these tents to vary according to the c 26
?202 Measures to prevent the [APP. VIII. importance of the road, the   number of   travellers   and the amount of traffic). IV.-A tent required for disinfection. V.-Articles required   for comfort   (furniture),   necessaries   of life, and supplies. VI.-A sufficient quantity of medicines and disinfectants. VII.-Some articles such as pails, earthenware vessels and   pans required for disinfection. (2) The following are the duties of the officials of sanitary posts:- The senior of the two doctors of a sanitary post shall inspect and examine travellers. The other doctor shall treat and look after persons suffering from plague, and besides this he shall undertake the work of disinfection. The latter with his attendants shall take up quarters quite apart from others, viz., he shall always live in the group of tents set apart for persons infected with plague, entirely separate and away from other groups of tents. These tents shall be at a distance of at least three hundred metres from the sanitary post. None of the persons belonging to this group of tents shall have any intercourse with the sanitary post, and their baggage and other necessaries shall also be quite separate. No one shall cross the frontier at night. The head of the sanitary post shall post necessary sentries and guards to detain travellers and arrivals till day-break, and in the course of the same day he shall determine how they are to be disposed of. When the travellers arrive on the frontier and their starting places and destinations are ascertained, the senior doctor shall examine them one by one, and without delay separate the persons with their baggage who are not to be allowed to cross or whom it is necessary to send to the sanitary post, from others. The other travel- lers who are not infected shall be placed under 15 days' quarantine, and, as far as possible, they shall be divided into several parties of a hundred each, the first arrivals taking precedence over those who arrive after them. During these 15 days, if anyone be seized with plague, he or she shall be sent, with his or her baggage, to the lazaretto; and the tent occupied by him or her shall be vacated and disinfected and then removed to another place. The companions of the patient shall be kept under observation for 15 days from the date of the appearance of the disease, and the site of the tent shall be cleaned very carefully. The second doctor and his attendants shall attend the patient, and, in case of death, the body shall be buried at the * 42 inches.             depth of a zar* at least, and, if possible, lime shall be sprinkled over   it.    In no   case  shall dead bodies be removed to distant places, and the deceased's property,
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 203 such as clothes and beddings, shall be burnt without delay. In case of the recovery of the patient he or she shall be placed under quaran- tine for a month, and his or her clothes and bedding shall be burnt. In case of a person being in indigent circumstances fresh clothes shall be supplied to him or her, and he or she shall be removed from the tent of patients to another tent. The site of the tents of patients shall be changed and cleaned at short intervals. Latrines shall be near the tents, but, as far as possible, on the side opposite to the direction from which the local winds blow. These latrines shall be narrow and deep ditches far away from drinking water, and shall be daily filled up after lime water has been poured into them. Filth and other things which cannot be burnt by fire, whatever they may be, shall also be thrown into latrine ditches. Arrangements for Supplies and Food. The Governors of districts shall issue necessary orders that a bazar shall be held near every quarantine post where rice, wheat, sheep, vegetables, and all other eatables and fodder required for man and beast shall be procured, stored, and always kept ready. Another bazar shall also be held for the Lazaretto quite separate and apart from the other. A list of prices of articles at moderate rates shall be proclaimed and hung up in order to prevent excessive charges. Poor patients shall be supplied with food and medicines free of charge. Great care shall be taken about drinking water, which shall not be allowed to be contaminated; especially corpses and clothes shall not be allowed to be washed in or animals permitted to enter and defile the spring or running drinking water. Persons infringing this order shall be liable to severe punishment. The best thing would be to fix separate spots for washing clothes and watering animals, and to take great care in cleaning and changing them at short intervals. Rules regarding Disinfection. I.-Clothes and baggage of plague-stricken persons shall be burnt without delay. II.-Clothes and baggage of healthy travellers shall be washed and disinfected before they are discharged from quarantine. (I) Means of disinfection- I. Burning. II. Boiling in water for an hour. III. Lotion of carbolic acid, five in a hundred, i.e., one miskal* in 20 miskals of water. * 2 1/2 miskals=1 tola
?204 Measures to prevent the [ APP. VIII. IV. Corrosive sublimate, one in thousand. V. Lotion of sulphate of copper, two in a hundred. VI. Lime water or liquor calcis.  6 ? lbs.  VII. Sulphur about a man to be burnt in an ordinary room. (2) Manner of carrying out disinfection- Burning articles by fire in an open place. Boiling (articles) in large caldrons. All chemical lotions can be prepared in any vessel, except the lotion of corrosive sublimate which spoils metals and which should, therefore, be prepared in glazed earthenware vessels or in vessels of the like kind a miskal of common salt being added to every man of the lotion. Lime water should be prepared by diluting a quantity of lime in the double quantity of water. For fumigation with sulphur.-Clothes and articles of that kind shall be hung up on ropes in a room, and pounded sulphur sprinkled on firepans full of fire (placed under them), all openings in the room being closed and crevices in doors, etc., plastered over with mud. The articles shall be removed after twenty-four hours - (3) Disinfection of certain different articles- I. Articles not made of cotton (such as drawers, handkerchiefs, socks, shawls, towels, and such like) to be disinfected with corrosive sublimate, or carbolic acid, or sulphate of copper, or to be boiled in water. II. Articles made of wool [such as banians, coats, trousers, over- coats, vests, cloaks (aba), and the like] to be disinfected with the above chemicals or to be fumigated with sulphur. III. Articles made of wax-cloth, leather, skin, or wood, or articles joined, glued, pasted or attached (to other articles) to be disinfected with the above chemicals, or to be fumigated with sulphur, but not to be boiled. IV. Clothes made of or lined with skins or furs, all kinds of skins and hides of animals shall not be allowed to cross the frontier (but in case it is necessary to pass them) they shall be kept for two days and nights in lotion of corrosive sublimate. V. Baggage, clothes and beddings of plague-stricken persons and articles of no value (such as chopped straw, grass, old clothes waste paper, rags, or remaining of medicines and food and the like) shall be burnt by fire which may be inflamed by pouring kerosine oil on it. VI. On the arrival of the post papers and important articles con- tained in it shall be fumigated with sulphur.
?APP. VIII. ] spread of infection by land. 205 VII. Tents occupied by plague-stricken persons shall be burnt after the abolition of quarantine. VIII. All other tents shall be washed by lotion of corrosive subli- mate. IX. For the disinfection of ground and sites of tents, the surface of the ground should be covered with dry dung soaked in kerosine oil which shall be set on fire. X. Discharges of patients and water used for washing shall be thrown into latrine ditches without delay, and every day, before they are filled up, lotion of green vitriol or sulphate of copper or lime shall be poured into them. XI. The vessels which are liable to be stained shall be of metal and every time after use they shall be washed with lotion of carbolic acid. XII. Doctors and their attendants and the comrades of patients and persons who have just recovered from illness shall first wash all their bodies several times with hot water and soap, and afterwards with lotion of corrosive sublimate. Their beards and hair shall be cut as short as possible, or at least washed thoroughly well with lotion of corrosive sublimate. First Warning. Travellers not abiding by the above regulations shall be turned back by force and not allowed to cross the frontier. Second Warning. Doctors and their attendants shall take great care in disinfecting themselves. If they take proper care and keep themselves clean, they are not liable to the disease and can enjoy immunity from it. For instance in India none of the doctors or their attendants, with the exception of only one, has been seized with the disease. Care should be taken in diet and heavy meals should be avoided, medicines like corrosive sublimate or carbolic acid should not be used in such large proportions as might make them poisonous.

In Home Department Resolution of 19th September 1878, after discussing the whole question of quarantine, and the action which has been taken from time to time on that subject in Indian ports, the Government of India laid down two leading principles: First, that a system of medical inspection is sufficient to meet the case of all vessels arriving with persons suffering from any disease which is endemic in this country; and secondly, that quarantine should be reserv- ed for occasions when there is danger of diseases being imported, which are either unknown or not commonly rife in India-such, for example, as plague and yellow fever. Local Governments and Admin- istrations were requested to submit draft rules in accordance with c 27
?210 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. these principles-one set for medical inspection which might, if it appeared necessary, be sanctioned under Act I of 1870, and would remain continuously in force; and another set for quarantine, which should be provisional, and would only be enforced, if occasion should arise, with the previous sanction of the Government of India. 2. Replies from the Local Governments, with sets of rules propos- ed by them, have been received; and in the meantime a despatch has also come from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India acknow- ledging the receipt of the Resolution of 19th September 1878. Lord Cranbrook expresses a hope that quarantine "rules may soon be drawn up which shall be consistent with the views of Her Majesty's Government and applicable to the whole of India." At the same time, he points out the importance of meeting the prejudices of other States as far as possible, so as to avoid the risk of restrictions being imposed on vessels passing through the Red Sea; and he adds- "With regard, however, to this point, I would especially impress on you that, if the Indian ports were known to be maintained in a thor- oughly sanitary condition, and if a complete system were in force of inspection of vessels arriving in port, including isolation of any persons on board who might be sick from disorders of an epidemic charac- ter, it is probable that the susceptibilities of other nations would be sufficiently met, and that all occasion would be taken away for the establishment of quarantine at any time in India." In a further des- patch (No. 22, dated 20th February 1879) on a kindred subject, the Secretary of State forwards with approval a letter from the Foreign Office, urging that the enforcement of misapplied quarantine rules at Indian ports "materially weakens the hands of Her Majesty's Govern- ment in protesting against bad quarantine arrangements at places be- longing to foreign powers." 3. Of the rules submitted by Local Governments, those for Madras were drawn up by a Committee; but the rules for medical inspection appear strict and complicated, and they are mixed up with the rules for quarantine proper. It is of primary importance that the two sets of rules should be kept quite distinct, both because this is more con- venient, and also because the one set is to be continuously in force, whereas the other set is to be specially sanctioned only when occasion arises. The Bombay rules are also open to some of the remarks stated above; and they might cause annoyance and hardship. The rules re- commended for Calcutta were drawn up by a Committee; but the two sets of rules have not been kept distinct as they ought to be, and they contain some provisions which could hardly be worked in prac- tice. The British Burma rules are simpler, but, if strictly acted on, they might do mischief without conferring any compensating benefit.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 211 The rules for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands make no mention of quarantine or medical inspection. They are intended merely to preserve discipline among the convicts, to prevent escapes and landing of forbidden articles. But the case of the Andamans is so peculiar that the requirements of that Settlement may be left out of account alto- gether. The case of Aden is under separate consideration. 4. After considering all the replies of Local Governments and the rules submitted by them, the Government of India have caused to be prepared, for the guidance of all Local Governments, two separate sets of rules, which are appended to this Resolution. These two sets of rules must be kept quite distinct from each other. The Quarantine Rules (Appendix B) can be, and are hereby sanctioned under Act I of 1870; but they will only be brought into operation very occasion- ally, with sanction of the Government of India, which must previously be obtained in each case. Such sanction will be given only in the case of plague, yellow fever, or some fatal epidemic not ordinarily prevalent among Indian populations. The Medical Inspection Rules (Appendix A), on the other hand, are intended for every-day use; they do not provide for any quarantine at all; and they should be regarded as executive orders of Government. 5. In conclusion, the Government of India take this opportunity of pressing upon the Local Governments concerned the great import- ance of attending to the sanitary condition of Indian ports, as urged by the Secretary of State, and also the good to be derived from seeing that all vessels leaving the port are well found in stores, &c., and are in every other respect in a condition favourable to the health of both passengers and crew. ORDER.-Ordered, that this Resolution, with the appended Rules, be forwarded to the Governments of Madras, Bombay, and Bengal, the Chief Commissioner of British Burma, and the Superintendent of Port Blair and the Nicobars, for information and guidance; and that a copy be forwarded to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. APPENDIX A. THE following Rules for the medical inspection of vessels are issued, for the guidance of Port Officers, Pilots, and Medical Officers of Ports, by the with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council: and they will take effect from the 1st June 1879 in the ports of I.-The master of every vessel on board of which there is, either among the passengers or crew, any case of cholera, small-pox, or other epidemic disease common in India, shall report such case or cases to the pilot or other boarding officer at the earliest opportunity, or, in the
?212 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. absence of a pilot or other boarding officer, shall hoist a signal, which shall be during the day flag R of the Commercial Code at the main and during the night two lighted lanterns, one over the other, at the fore. II.-The Port Officer, having received information from the pilot or other boarding officer, or by signal, that any case of such disease is on board, shall communicate the information to the Health Officer of the Port. III.-The Health Officer, as early as possible after receipt of this information, shall inspect the vessel, and more especially its sanitary condition; shall inquire into the circumstances attending the case or cases of the said disease; and shall arrange for the conveyance of all persons suffering from such disease to a hospital, unless the sick person or his friends can make adequate provision elsewhere. IV.-The latter part of Rule No. III is, however, not to be en- forced in the case of passengers bound for an onward port, unless under the clearest necessity; and of every such case a special report, explaining the reasons for the action taken, must be submitted to the Government, V.-Where the disease or diseases in question are limited to one or two cases, the vessel shall not be prohibited from taking up the usual place of anchorage in the harbour, nor shall the passengers be detained on board pending the inspection of the Health Officer; but the master of the vessel shall be held responsible that no passenger suspected of having such disease is allowed to depart before this inspection. VI.-Where cases have been more numerous than one or two, or when, from their occurring on pilgrim or emigrant ships, or for other special reasons, further precautions may be deemed advisable, the vessel shall anchor in the place appointed for the purpose; and none of the passengers shall be allowed to leave until the Health Officer has made his inspection. VII.-Vessels coming under this last rule shall be thoroughly cleansed and fumigated, under the directions of the Health Officer. In the case of small-pox, it shall also be his duty to vaccinate or have vaccinated all those on board who appear to require this protection and are willing to accept it. APPENDIX B. IN exercise of the power conferred by Act I of 1870, the following Rules for quarantine against plague or yellow fever have been made
?APP. IX.]                    spread of infection by sea. 213 by                     , with the previous sanction of the Governor  General in Council; they will take effect from the in the port of                                              :- I.-The commander of every vessel, including buggalows or other native craft, arriving from a port where plague or yellow fever pre- vails, shall, before entering the harbour, indicate by signal the port from which she has come. II.-Such commander shall not, without having first obtained per- mission as hereinafter provided, allow any communication either with the pilot boat, except orally, or with the shore, or with any other vessel or boat in the harbour. III.-Immediately on the signal of such arrivals being made, the Health Officer of the port shall go alongside the vessel, and ascertain by enquiry from the commander whether any person on board is then suffering, or has during the voyage suffered, from plague; and if such officer is satisfied by such enquiry that no such case has occurred, he shall by writing under his hand, to be delivered to the commander, permit free communication between such vessel and the shore, and with other vessels and boats in the harbour. IV.-If the Health Officer shall have reason to believe that any such case has occurred, he shall direct the commander to take the vessel to the quarantine anchorage duly appointed and notified by Government, there to remain for the space of fifteen days from the day of arrival in the harbour or from the date of the occurrence of the latest case of illness, and shall further direct the commander to pro- hibit during the said fifteen days all communication, except such as is hereinafter provided for, between such vessel and the shore, or other vessels or boats in the harbour.

?230 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. ship carries a qualified Medical Officer, quarantine shall be dispensed with, and pratique granted. If the vessel does not carry a qualified Medical Officer, he shall direct the Commander to take the vessel to the quarantine anchorage duly appointed and notified by the Commissioner in Sind, and there to remain for a period of eight clear days from the date of arrival in the har- bour. The Health Officer shall also direct the Com- mander to prohibit, during the period for which the vessel remains at the quarantine anchorage as aforesaid, all communication, except such as is hereinafter provided for, between such vessel and the shore or other vessels and boats in the harbour. IV.-If the Health Officer, as the result of the enquiry made under paragraph III above, shall have reason to believe at the time when the vessel arrives in the harbour that any person on board is suffering or during the voyage has suffered, from plague, he shall direct the Commander to take the vessel to the quarantine anchorage as afore- said, and there to remain for a period of fifteen days from the day of arrival in the harbour; and shall fur- ther direct that during such fifteen days' intercourse between the said vessel and the shore or other vessels and boats in the harbour shall be prohibited as provided in Rule III. V.-If during the period a vessel is at the quarantine anchorage aforesaid any case or cases of plague should occur on board, the said vessel shall remain in quarantine for a period of fifteen days from the date of termination of the last case either by death, recovery or removal from the Vessel and be subject to all the prohibitions provided for in Rules III and IV. VI.-When any vessel has been placed in quarantine as afore- said, the Health Officer may direct the removal of so many of the passengers and crew as may not be suffer- ing from illness, and whose services may not be required on board the vessel, to such particular spots as may from time to time be selected by the Commissioner in Sind as places of quarantine, there to remain for a period of eight days, or if the vessel has been placed in quarantine for fifteen days, for a period of fifteen days. If a case of plague occurs among such passengers and crew during

Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessels in quarantine to be subsequently removed by members of their crews. IX.-All vessels arriving at Karachi which may have communi- cated with vessels coming from Bombay, shall be subject- ed to the same rules as vessels arriving at Karachi from Bombay. No. 32.

These rules will be notified in the Calcutta Gazette and pub- lished in the newspapers as soon as sanction to their imposition is received in reply to this Department's telegram of the 18th instant referred to above. 3. As regards the Orissa ports, I am to say that vessels from Bombay rarely visit them, but to provide against such a contingency rules empowering the Port Officers of Chandballi and False Point to prohibit any communication with the shore in the case of vessels which have not been granted pratique at Colombo, or other interme- diate port, or which have suspicious cases of sickness on board, are being drafted and will shortly be submitted to the Government of India. There are no Health Officers at Chandballi or False Point and the course proposed seems the only one possible. Notification by the Government of India, Home Department, No. 359, dated No. 35.

?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 245 No. 49. Notification of the Government of India, in the Home Department, No. 28, dated the 14th January 1897. Rules at Rangoon against Karachi. The following rules for quarantine against plague which have been made by the Chief Commissioner of Burma in exercise of the power  conferred by section 1, Act I of 1870, with the previous sanction of  the Governor General in Council, are published for general inform- ation. The rules have effect from the 1st January 1897 as a temporary measure at the port of Rangoon:- I.-The commander of every vessel, including junks or other native craft, arriving from Karachi, shall, on arrival at the pilot brig, hoist a yellow flag and indicate by signal the port from which she has come. II.-Such commander shall not, except as hereinafter provided, allow any communication either with the shore or with any other vessel or boat except with the boat supplying a pilot from the pilot brig, and in that case communi- cation shall be limited to receiving on board the pilot, his servant, if any, and baggage. III.-The pilot shall not take such vessel higher than Elephant Point, but shall anchor it there until the Health Officer of the Port has visited it and ascertained by inquiry from the commander whether any person on board is suffering, or has during the voyage suffered, from plague.  If the Health  Officer is satisfied by such enquiry that no person on board is suffering, or during the voyage has suffered, from plague, the Health Officer may, by writing under his hand to be delivered to the commander, permit such vessel to haul down the yellow flag and proceed upwards in the port and hold free communication with the shore and with vessels and boats in port. Provided that, if the vessel has under- gone since leaving Karachi a quarantine, which is pro- perly proved, for not less than eight days at Colombo, or some other British port, the Health Officer shall grant such permission as aforesaid. If the vessel has not undergone eight days' quarantine at Colombo or some other British port since leaving Karachi, the Health Officer may direct the commander to take the vessel to the quaran- tine anchorage and there to remain for a period of eight days from the date of arrival in the harbour. In such case the Health Officer shall also direct the commander to prohibit, during the period for which the vessel remains at the quarantine anchorage as aforesaid
?246 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. all communication, except such as is hereinafter provided for between such vessel and the shore, or other vessels and boats in the har- bour. IV.-If the Health Officer shall have reason to believe at the time when the vessel arrives in the harbour that any person on board is suffering, or during the voyage has suffered, from plague, he shall direct the commander to take the vessel to the quarantine anchorage as afore- said, and there to remain for a period of fifteen days from the day of arrival in the harbour; and shall further direct that during such fifteen days intercourse between the said vessel and the shore or other vessels and boats in the harbour shall be prohibited as provided in Rule II. V.-If during the period a vessel is at the quarantine anchorage aforesaid any case or cases of plague should occur on board, the said vessel shall remain in quarantine for a period of fifteen days from the date of the last case occurring, and be subject to all the prohibitions pro- vided for in Rules III and IV. VI.-When any vessel has been placed in quarantine as afore- said, the Health Officer may direct the removal of so many of the passengers and crew as may not be suffer- ing from illness, and whose services may not be required on board the vessel, to such particular spots as may from time to time be selected by the Chief Commis- sioner as places of quarantine, there to remain for a period of eight days, or if the vessel has been placed in quarantine for fifteen days, for a period of fifteen days. If a case of plague occurs among such passengers and crew during any such period, they shall remain in a place of quarantine for a period of fifteen days from the date of the occurrence of the last case of such illness. VII.-Any mails or cargo which may be brought by any vessel so arriving shall be landed under such precautions as the Health Officer may deem necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. VIII.-It will be the duty of the Conservator of the Port to facili- tate the conveyance to all vessels in quarantine or such supplies of provisions, stores, and other articles as may be required by those on board. Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessels in quarantine to be subsequently romoved by members of their crews.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 247 IX.-All vessels arriving at Rangoon, which may have commu- nicated with any vessel coming from Karachi, shall be subjected to the same quarantine as vessels arriving at Rangoon from Karachi unless the communication was held after the vessel from Karachi was released from quarantine.

?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 249 (4) If a vessel arrives with a case of simple fever on board, the above rules-shall apply to her, but the detention shall be for a period of four days, subsequent to which, if no plague cases develope, she may be granted entry inwards.

Vessels arriving from such ports, even if no case of plague has occurred on board, shall not be granted entry inwards unless or until eight clear days have elapsed from the date of her departure from the aforesaid port. If the vessel arrives before the expiry of such eight days, she shall remain at the anchorage fixed for such vessels until such eight days have elapsed, subject to the condi- tions laid down in Rules 2, 5, and 6, after which, if no plague case is discovered on board, she shall obtain pratique. If plague is developed or has been developed before her arrival, all the above quarantine rules shall apply to her, her crew, passengers and cargo. MODIFICATION OF THE ADEN QUARANTINE RULES. No. 52.

APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 253 No. 65. No. 777, dated Bombay Castle, the 12th February I897. From-J. DEC. ATKINS, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. 1. Standard quarantine rules. 2. Standard quarantine rules with modifications of rule III (in ink). * 3. Report by the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs. 4. Report by the Advocate General. I am directed to forward herewith copies of the papers mentioned in the margin and to solicit instruc- tions as to whether any, and if so. what, changes should be made in the standard quarantine rules as sanction- ed for Aden, with a view to providing for the change introduced by Notifi- cation No. 583, dated 3rd February I897. 2. On the one hand it is desirable to make quarantine rigorous with a view to preventing the importation of plague into Aden. and also to preventing quarantine against Aden being imposed by foreign countries. On the other hand it is difficult and perhaps undesirable to interfere with ships using Aden as a port of call unless they land or tranship passengers at Aden or desire to have any intercourse with the shore. 3. If in Rule III, paragraph (t), of the standard rules the words "quarantine shall be dispensed with and pratique granted" are retained, certain difficulties arise. In the first place the new rule, which must be introduced to provide against the landing of passengers, is pro tanto a contradiction of this rule. In the next place it is not intended that quarantine of any kind shall be dispensed with or that any kind of pratique shall be granted, except in the event of a vessel having left Bombay ten days previously: and hence the retention of these words, notwithstanding the modification proposed by the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, might in practice give rise to miscon- ception and lead foreign countries to think that the quarantine arrangements at Aden were less rigorous than is intended and than is actually the case. 4. If on the other hand rule III, paragraph (I), is, modified as shown in ink in draft 2, special provision must be made for ships using Aden as a mere port of call. It is not intended to detain these ships against the wishes of their Commanders, but it is desirable to provide, until ten days have elapsed since their departure from Bom- bay, that they shall have no intercourse with the shore and no inter. course with other ships except at places appointed for, the purpose and subject to regulations for placing those shipsin quarantine. 5. Rule IV appears to require modification for the purpose of providing for the cases of ships using Aden as merely a port of call * Not printed.
254 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. and either desiring not to land passengers or to land them in quaran- tine: and also for the case of ships, whether using Aden merely as a port of call or not, which desire to tranship passengers to other ships in quarantine. 6. I am to invite attention to the recommendation of the Advo- cate General that the earliest opportunity should be taken of redraft- ing the rules. Report by the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, dated 5th February 1897. I have found it a difficult task to say how the proposed modifica- tions in these rules should be worded. The object in itself is simple, viz., as stated in the Gazette Extra- ordinary of the 3rd instant, to impose quarantine "on persons land- ing at Aden up to Io days from date of leaving Bombay or Karachi." Cf. telegram of Government of India, dated 2nd instant. 2. The first point is with regard to Rule III. As first altered (in ink) the rule would impose quarantine on all vessels from Bombay (or Karachi) coming to Aden, whether they landed persons at Aden or not. This would obviously go beyond the original intention of the amendment and would cause inconvenience. 3. There seem to be two ways of meeting the difficulty, either (a) to make rule of detention apply to all vessels (from Bombay or Karachi) adding a proviso in favour of vessels using Aden only as a port of call, or (b) to leave the Ist part of Rule III unaltered (allowing vessels showing a clean bill of health to go on their way) adding a proviso regarding the detention of all persons landing at Aden. * It is doubtful, however, whether  this rule is meant to apply (or is practically worked as applying) to vessels which do not wish to remain at Aden.  4. Both modes have been suggested. The latter would seem better to meet the original intention and to be the less cumbrous in form. Both modes, however, would leave Rule IV untouched, and this rule seems to require the detention of all vessels with plague on board, whether they wish to land passengers at Aden or not.* Moreover as soon as we begin to modify the wording of the rules, various practical difficulties seem to arise regarding the way in which vessels only calling at Aden (to land or tranship passengers) are to be distinguished from vessels staying there for a longer period. 5. After much consideration and after looking to the actual sane- tion contained in the telegram of the Government of India I would venture to suggest the following course.
APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 255 The rules may be left as they originally were with the following addition:- "X.-Notwithstanding anything contained in the above-mentioned rules, no persons wishing to be landed at Aden, Perim or the Somali Coast from vessels coming from Bombay (or Karachi) shall be per- mitted to be so landed except from the quarantine anchorage and at such particular spots as may be selected by the Resident as places of quarantine under Rule VI above. Such persons (if landed from vessel coming under Rule III above) shall remain at such places until a period of ten days shall have elapsed from the time of their departure from Bombay (or Karachi). If landed from a vessel coming under Rule IV above, such persons shall remain at such places for a period of I5 days from the day of arrival in the harbour. If a case of plague occurs amongst any such persons during such periods, they shall remain in a place of quarantine for a period of I5 days from the date of the occurrence of the last case of such illness." No. 10 of 1897. Opinion of the Advocate General, Bombay. I think the course suggested by the Legal Remembrancer will carry out the directions of the Government of India, and if the rules are not redrafted almost entirely, it is the best course to adopt. I would suggest that the rule proposed by the Legal Remembrancer be adopted for the present, but that the earliest opportunity be taken of redrafting the rules. As regards the wording of the proposed new rule, I would suggest that it should run " notwithstanding any thing contained in the above- mentioned rules, no persons from vessels coming from Bombay or Karachi shall land at Aden, Perim or the Somali Coast except from the quarantine anchorage et seq.," as in the Legal Remembrancer's draft.

Can Port Surgeon go on board a ship in quaran- tine without being compromised? Modified rule three would seem to conflict with Notification 583, which enjoins ten days' quarantine against infected ports to which both notifications alone refer. Inspec- tion of ships seems quite unnecessary so long as quarantine exists.- Ends. Port Health Officers MacCartie and Crimmin here agree that if Port Surgeon boards a ship in quarantine, he is compromised; we have therefore wired Aden pending further orders not to allow Port Surgeon to board any ships till ten days of quarantine counting from date of leaving Bombay and Karachi have expired. Orders solicited. The rules will require redrafting, and it is proposed to act on present rules as modified and partly superseded by Notification 583 till new rules can be drafted and submitted by Resident.

APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 265 enforced, vessels which have finished their loading and are otherwise ready to start will still be liable to a further detention of not less than 24 hours by having to wait for the port clearance until the Bill of Health has been granted by the Port Health Officer. The Cham- ber suggest that the provisions of this rule might be carried out with a minimum of inconvenience to the vessels if the loading of cargo (which is not inspected by the Health Officer) were allowed to be proceeded with until the last moment, and if the Health Officer were permitted to give the ordinary Bill of Health to enable the vessel to obtain port clearance and leave, provided that when passengers are carried, she be accompanied down the river by one of the assistants of the Health Officer, who shall inspect the ship and passengers and grant a final Bill of Health on board. 2. In reply I am to say that in order to meet the wishes of the Chamber as far as possible, Surgeon-Captain Jay Gould, at present an Inspecting Officer under the Epidemic Diseases Act at Khana Junction, will be appointed an additional Port Health Officer for the purpose of conducting the inspection of vessels under the Regulation, and Dr. Banks, the present Superintendent of Emigration, will be employed on the same work in addition to his own duties. The Port Health Officer will be instructed to arrange for the distribution of the work between himself and the additional Health Officers in such manner as may be convenient with reference to the departure of vessels. 3. The Collector of Customs has been authorised to grant port clear- ance under section 66 of the Sea Customs Act on a guarantee being given by the agents of a vessel that within 48 hours of departure they will produce a duplicate copy of the Bill of Health as finally granted, signed by the Port Health Officer or an additional Port Health Officer, and that if for any reason the Health Officer should refuse to grant the Bill of Health, they will bring the vessel back to her moor- ings. 4. As regards cargo I am to explain that although, as the Chamber observe, the Port Health Officer does not inspect the process of loading closely, the general nature of the cargo is stated in the Bill of Health, and in view of the apprehensions of foreign nations in respect of certain kinds of goods, it would not be advisable to omit all refer- ence to cargo. 5. For the reasons stated above, the Lieutenant-Governor does not consider it necessary to amend the Regulation, which corresponds closely to that in force in Bombay and Madras; but I am to express the hope that the appointment of additional Port Health Officers will remove the inconveniences complained of, c 34
266 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. No. 855, dated Calcutta, the 1st June 1897. From-W. PARSONS, Esq., Secretary, Bengal Chamber of Commerce, To-The HON'BLE H. H. RISLEY, I.C.S., C.I.E., Secretary to the Gov- ernment of Bengal, Financial Department. On the 28th May I had the honour to address to you the following telegram:-Telegram begins. Representations have been made to the Committee that clause 4 of Plague Notification Number 3 of 25th May will entail great inconvenience and delay to steamers sailing for foreign ports and also cause great inconvenience to passengers who would have to embark the day previous to vessel's sailing. Com- mittee trust His Honour will agree to hold working of clause 4 in abeyance until full representations have been made to Government.- Telegram ends. And have now to acknowledge receipt of your message of 30th ultimo in reply, reading as follows:-Telegram begins. Lieutenant-Governor cannot suspend rule 4 of revised Plague Notification 3 which is in force both in Madras and Bombay, but will consider any representations submitted.-Telegram ends. My telegram was despatched in consequence of an urgent repre- sentation made by the Committee of the Liners' Conference (which comprises all the regular lines of vessels sailing from this port) point- ing out that under rule 4 of Plague Notification No. 3 of the 25th May no cargo or passengers could be taken on board a vessel after the Bill of Health had been granted, and that if this rule were strictly enforced, it would mean, ordinarily, an extra delay of 24 hours to the vessel; possibly in the event of a vessel finishing her loading on Saturday, a delay of two days and occasionally if the vessel missed a tide by waiting for the bill of health and the port clearance, a delay of three, four or even five days according to the state of the river. 2. The Committee of the Chamber and the Committee of the Liners' Conference have no desire whatever to ask for a modification of any regulations which appear to Government absolutely essential to prevent the spread of plague, but, as pointed out in the letter received from the Secretary of the Liners' Conference, a copy of which I enclose, and which contains a very clear statement of the position as it appears from the point of view of steamers' agents, it was thought that possibly, when the present notification was issued, the full consequences in the way of pecuniary loss and personal incon- venience were hardly realised, and that a way might be found of altering the rule so as to minimise this loss and inconvenience with- out in any way increasing the risk of the spread of plague. The Com- mittee note from your telegram that the same notification is now in force both in Madras and Bombay; but they would point out that although a certain amount of inconvenience must also be experienced in those
APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 267 ports, the departure of vessels therefrom is not surrounded by the same difficulties as attach to a port like Calcutta, one hundred miles from the mouth of a dangerous tidal river. 3. The Committee would venture to suggest for the consideration of Government that the provisions of rule 4 might be carried out with a minimum of inconvenience to vessels if the loading of cargo (which is not inspected by the Health Officer) were allowed to be proceeded with as formerly until the last moment, and if the Health Officer were permitted to give the ordinary bill of health to enable the vessel to obtain port clearance and leave, provided that (if passengers were carried) she be accompanied down the river to any point which Government may indicate, either Garden Reach, Budge Budge, or, if necessary, Diamond Harbour by one of the Health Officer's assist- ants, who shall, as convenient, inspect the ship and passengers and grant a final bill of health on board. This course, it appears to the Committee, would, to a great extent, meet the difficulties which have now been submitted to Government, and I am instructed to add that the suggestion now made has the approval of Mr. Raker, the Collec- tor of Customs, and of Dr. Forsyth, the Health Officer of the Port. 4. The Committee in conclusion would venture to place before Government the personal experience of the Hon'ble Mr. C. Turner, Vice-President of the Chamber, who recently embarked at Madras on board the S.S. Goorkha. Mr. Turner writes as follows:- I was on board the S.S. Goorkha by 11-30 A.M. and all cargo work was stopped at 11-45. The Health Officer of the Port was on board and made casual examination of the passengers who, like myself, had embarked at Madras. He left the ship at noon to give his bill of health to the agents' clerk, who then had to take the bill to the Custom House and obtain a port clearance. At 12-30 we received notice that as the Health Officer had noticed passengers embarking subsequent to his inspection, he would not give the bill of health before making another inspection between 4 and 5 P.M. It appears that two second class passengers from Calcutta had left the ship early in the morning unknown to the Commander, and return- ed as the Health Officer was landing on the pier steps after leaving the Goorkha. I presume he watched them on board and then wrote to the Agents. We were thus detained pending the pleasure of the Health Officer to visit the ship again. He returned soon after 4 P.M., and we obtained port clearance at 5 P.M. The loss of this time meant arriving off Colombo on Wednesday morning instead of Tuesday even- ing, and was a clear twelve hours' loss to the ship on her home passage. The same thing may happen again at any time.
368 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Dated Calcutta, the 28th May 1897. From-The Secretary, Liners' Conference, To-The Secretary, Chamber of Commerce. In continuation of my letter of yesterday, and in response to the request of your Committee, I address you more in detail with regard to the new rules published in the Calcutta Gazette of 26th instant, page 608, respecting Bills of Health. Under these rules, paragraph 4, no cargo or passengers can be taken on board a vessel after the bill of health has been granted. To those conversant with the management of ships it would at once be apparent that, if this rule is adhered to, vessels must be detained 24 hours in port after they are ready for sea. But in order to make this generally clear, it may be necessary to explain that it has been the invariable custom to obtain the bill of health, port clear- ance, etc., while the loading is being completed, so that a vessel may leave the next morning. In the case of steamers, work usually goes on throughout the night and often up to the very moment of starting. Under the rule now issued this cannot be done, for a vessel com- pleting her loading, say this Friday evening, in place of clearing to- day and starting tomorrow, must wait until then for the bill of health which, when obtained, has to be presented at the Custom House for port clearance and if the vessel is foreign bound, taken to a Consul for countersignature. By the time all this is done it would be too late for a start and the ship must remain where she is till Sunday. In the case of a ship finishing her loading on a Saturday, two days would be lost, as a bill of health, or certainly a port clearance, could not be obtained on a Sunday, and the vessel would therefore be detained till Tuesday. It may be thought that a bill of health might possibly be obtained at a sufficiently early hour to enable the ship to leave the same day. But the bill of health is only a preliminary to the port clearance; and even when no Consul's signature is required, by the time the Custom House is open, the tide would usually be lost. There are frequently, moreover, two or more vessels clearing in one day, which would naturally delay the Health Officer. In the dry weather when the water in the river is low, it frequently happens that the larger steamers have to take in coals or cargo or passengers, or all three, at Diamond Harbour, after having cleared in Calcutta. Under the new rules a clearance could not be obtained before leaving Calcutta, and the difficulty of getting a bill of health, etc., for a vessel in Diamond Harbour is obvious.
APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 269 That the detention of a day or more must occur under the new rules is therefore evident, and this is a serious matter for all vessels; but the inconvenience to be expected will be most generally appreciated in the case of passengers. Instead of joining the ships as hitherto at the moment of departure, they will now have to go on board the previous morning to allow the Health Officer to make his inspection and issue his certificate, and they will have to remain in the ship at her moorings in practical quarantine for a day and a night. The Liners' Conference has every sympathy with Government in its endeavours to prevent the spread of plague; but it is thought that when issuing the present notification, the full consequences in the way of pecuniary loss and personal inconvenience were hardly realis- ed, and I am desired to request that your Chamber will lay the facts before the Secretary to the Government of Bengal with a view to some modification being made in the terms of paragraph IV. No. 81. No. 1774, dated Simla, the 2nd July 1897. From-R. NATHAN, Esq., Under Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal (Medical) Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.355-T.M., dated the 12th June, submitting for the information of the Govern- ment of India a copy of a letter from the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and of its enclosure representing the inconvenience caused to vessels by rule 4 of the revised Plague Notification No. 3, dated the 25th May 1897, together with a copy of the orders passed thereon by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor. 2. The orders give effect to a proposal of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce that the Health Officer should be permitted to give the ordinary bill of health to enable the vessel to obtain port clearance and leave, provided that when passengers are carried, she be accom- panied down the river by one of the assistants of the Health Officer, who shall inspect the ship and passengers, and grant a final bill of health. 3. I am to observe that the arrangements which involve the examination of passengers on board ship are opposed to the provisions of Chapter I, Section II, of the regulation appended to the Venice  Sanitary Convention of 1897. It was explained in paragraph 5 of my letter No. 1625, dated the 1st June, and in paragraph 3 (ii) of my letter No. 1674, dated the 9th June, that the Venice Convention requires the examination of all persons sailing on the vessels to be
270 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. effected on shore prior to departure. Under the terms of the Con- vention foreign Governments may extend their precautions to arrivals from uninfected portions of the country if the Government does not take measures to prevent the infection of ships leaving healthy ports. There is a possibility, probably regarded by the authorities in Europe as greater than it would be regarded in India, of infected persons com- ing from infected areas to embark at healthy ports such as Calcutta, and the Government of India therefore determined that an examination should be made of all persons embarking from a healthy port to Europe, with a view to ascertain whether they come from an infected area, and if so, whether they are infected or likely to be infected with plague. For the same reasons the Government of India consider that it is very desirable that the examination should take place exactly in the manner prescribed by the Convention. Furthermore if the examination is not made until the passengers are on board, then the discovery of a plague case will necessitate the vessel being treated as infected when she proceeds on her journey. 4. In view of these considerations the Government of India will be glad if, with the permission of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, the orders issued by the Government of Bengal are modified so as to require the examination of all persons sailing on the vessel to take place on shore prior to departure. The Governor-General in Council considers that with a sufficient staff of inspecting medical officers examination on shore in the manner prescribed by the Venice Conven- tion should not cause any serious delay in the departure of vessels nor any serious inconvenience to the passengers; and His Excellency in Council trusts that, if this has not already been done, arrangements will be made to minimise the inconvenience by the appointment of a sufficient staff.

No deck passenger who appears to the Port Officer to belong to the labouring classes shall be permitted to embark on board a vessel within the port of Tuticorin bound for a port in Ceylon, until he has satisfied the Medical Officer of the Government of that Colony stationed at Tuticorin that he has not within the preceding ten days resided in or visited a port of India infected by the plague and that he is free from infection with the plague and until the said Colonial officer has c 35
?274 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. so certified in respect of him. The Health Officer of the Port of Tuticorin shall not deliver a bill of health in respect of any such vessel, if there be on board any such passenger in respect of whom the Colonial officer has not certified as aforesaid. No. 84. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Madras of the 28th April  1897. Read again the following paper:- G. O., No. 86t-M., dated 10th April 1897. Read also the following paper:- Telegram from the Colonial Secretary, Colombo, to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Madras, dated 5th April 1897. Doctor Moraes appointed for duty Tuticorin. Government assumes that there will be no objection to his examining all passengers on board for Ceylon, none being allowed to land without his certificate. Order No. 999-M., dated 28th April 1897. Dr. Moraes has been deputed by the Government of Ceylon for duty at Tuticorin in connection with the examination of passengers for Ceylon from parts of India infected by the plague. Every facility will be afforded him for the inspection of persons proceeding as cooly emigrants from this Presidency, and no person of that class will be permitted to embark without a certificate from Dr. Moraes. A regulation will be issued to that effect accordingly. Other passen- gers may voluntarily present themselves before Dr. Moraes and obtain his certificate for use on landing in the Colony, but will not be required to do so. They should, however, be warned that they will be liable to be prevented from landing at Colombo unless they possess Dr. Moraes' certificate. The foregoing instructions do not in any way dispense with the necessity imposed on all passengers conforming to the existing plague and quarantine regulations. 2. The Collector of Tinnevelly will report how the Health Officer at the Port of Tuticorin assures himself that emigrants who profess to be Madrasi coolies from an uninfected district are really such and not travellers from an infected area passing themselves off as such coolies to evade the plague rules and regulations. He will also report in what manner, in his opinion, the Colonial officer who has been deputed to Tuticorin can best assist the local authorities in the necessary examination and enquiries on the point. 3. The following telegram will be despatched to the Colonial Secretary, Colombo:-"Your telegram, 5th instant. Orders under issue requiring all persons embarking as Madrassi cooly emigrants to procure Dr. Moraes' certificate. Other passengers may also volunta- rily obtain his certificate,"
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 275 REVISED MADRAS QUARANTINE RULES. No. 85. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Madras, Marine Department, No. 363, dated the 22nd April 1897. Read the following papers:- No. 689-S., dated Madras, the 18th March 1897. From-SURGEON-LIEUTEXANT-COLONEL W. G. KING, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, To-The Secretary to Government. Public Works (Marine) Depart- ment. With reference to G. O., Mis. 301-M., dated 26th February 1897, I have the honour to forward somewhat modified suggested regulations as to ports in connection with plague. For convenience of reference I forward an extract from my letter referred to in the Government Order quoted. Extract from letter from Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. King, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., Sanitary Commissioner for Madras, to the Secretary to Government, Local and Municipal Department, No. 434, dated 20th February 1897. With reference to telegram from the Chief Secretary, dated 1st instant, received by me on the evening of the 12th and to G. O. No. 165, dated 20th January 1897, I have the honour to submit, here- with, suggestions for the regulations in connection with the proposed Epidemic Diseases Prevention Act. 2. Most of the regulations suggested are justified as to precedent by English or Indian Law-several are merely transcripts altered to suit local requirements. In the case of the section referring to ship- ping, the wording is throughout practically that of the General Order* * To all Port Sanitary Authorities. (L.G.B. England), 1890. I would parti- cularly invite your attention to the re- gulations in this connection. Those issued by Government as a temporary measure in Fort St. George Gazette Notification, No. 30, dated 12th instant, seem to me most undesirable. The method adopted by these is virtually that of penning up the sick and healthy in an infected ship alike, notwithstanding the discretion given to the Medical Officer of Health. This course has not in practice proved successful. So long as men have money with free wills and means of locomotion, they will defy such measures of quarantine, and the very sense of safety which such apparently stringent measures elicit, conduces to failure. There is nothing more likely to hamper trade, and spread disease than a defective system of quarantine. Such measures are in strong contrast
?276 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. to those possible on land. If it were necessary to hem up sick and healthy alike in a ship, why not also so detain the occupants of a train ? No country has had more experience of these matters than England, but she has finally rejected such measures, adopting instead the liberal- minded regulations I have quoted. In short, I would advise on sea as on land the application of the method of "observation" which has al- ready been adopted under my advice by the Municipality of Madras and other municipalities throughout the Presidency. This system of observation must be supplemented by rapid action on the part of all authorities to secure a safe sanitary condition of each locality, and a sufficient sanitary staff to effect rapid segregation of all infected per- sons and matters. No. 110-G., dated the 23rd March 1897. From -COMMANDER H. A. STREET, R.I.M., Presidency Port Officer, Madras, To-The Secretary to Government, Marine Department. With reference to the proposals contained in letter No. 689-3, dated 18th March 1897, from the Sanitary Commissioner, which ac- companied Marine Department Memorandum No. 209-E., dated 20th March 1897 (enclosures herewith returned), I have the honour to make the following remarks for the information of Government, viz.:- (1) Regulations as to shipping.-I think that the definition given in clauses (2), (3) and (4) of section 3 of Indian Ports Act X of 1889 of the terms "Port officer," "vessel" and "Master" should be subs- tituted for the definition proposed by the Sanitary Commissioner. (2) Respecting the hoisting of flags. It is proposed that flag Q shall be hoisted on board of an infected ship, and that a black flag shall be hoisted below flag Q under certain conditions, but as it is proposed that a vessel shall be deemed infected with plague in which there is, or has been during the voyage, or during the stay of such vessel in a port in the course of such voyage, any case of plague, it would be necessary, according to the instructions contained in the concluding part of 1 (a), for the second flag to be displayed. If this is so, when should flag Q be alone shown ? With regard to the "black" flag, I would point out that vessels are not supplied with flags of that colour. I would suggest flag R (the flag used to denote the presence of cholera, small-pox or other epidemic disease on board ship) being used instead. Flag Q should be hoisted at the foremasthead instead of being displayed, as proposed, below the ensign where it would not be so distinguishable. No signal is proposed to meet the case of an infected vessel arriving at a port
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 277 after dark; I, therefore, propose that such vessel shall hoist, on com- ing to an anchor, one white light at the foremasthead and one red light at the mainmasthead. (3) I have no remarks to make regarding the proposals under the heading "regulations as to detention by Port officer." (4) Regulations as to Sanitary authorities.-In paragraph 6, the expression "Chief officer of the Port" is used; the term Port officer should be substituted. I have no further remarks to offer. Telegram No. 1290 (Sanitary), dated Simla, the 14th April 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Madras, Marine Department. Your telegram dated 3rd. Government of India agree to proposal of Sanitary Commissioner, Madras, that rules should issue under Act 3 of 1897 that all passengers from infected ship should be landed, sick being sent to isolation hospital. They are not however able to agree that healthy should be allowed to proceed to their destination and there kept under observation in accordance with general order of English Local Government Board of 1890, the reason being that one of principal objects of quarantine regulations imposed on Indian ports is to prevent quarantine in Europe of ships sailing from them, and if European powers understood that quarantine was not rigorously enforced at Madras, neither that port nor others at which vessels proceeding from it might touch on way to Europe would be regarded as uninfected. Healthy should therefore be detained under observation in suitable isolation shelter for ten days from date of landing or from last subsequent case. Clothing of passengers and other susceptible articles should be disinfected before passengers allowed to leave. Please send copy of rules for publication in Gazette of India stating date from which they take effect. Order thereon by the Government cf Madras. Ordered that the following notification be published in the Fort St. George and all Maritime District Gazettes:- NOTIFICATION. In exercise of the powers delegated to him by the Governor-Gen- eral in Council under section 2, sub-section (3) of the Epidemic Dis- eases Act, 1897, His Excellency the Governor in Council is pleased to prescribe, under the said Epidemic Diseases Act, the following temporary regulations to be observed in all ports of the Madras
?278 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Presidency. These regulations will come into effect from the date of publication thereof and will supersede the regulations now in force under Act 1 of 1870. Definitions. In these regulations- "Vessel" includes anything made for conveyance by water or human beings or of property. "Port officer" includes any person acting under the authority of Government in charge of Port discipline. "Master," when used in relation to any vessel, means any person (except a pilot or harbour master) having for the time being the charge or control of the vessel. "Sanitary authority" means the Collector of the district, and every Municipal Council and Local Board, the area under whose jurisdiction includes or abuts on any part of a customs port; and the jurisdiction of every Sanitary authority shall, for the purposes of these regulations, extend to seaward for a distance of three miles beyond low water mark on all parts of the coast line bounding the area ordi- narily under its jurisdiction. "Port Health officer" includes any duly qualified medical practi- tioner appointed by a Sanitary authority or by the Local Government to act in the execution of these regulations. For the purpose of these regulations, every vessel shall be deemed infected with plague in which there is, or has been, during the voyage then in progress or presently concluded, or during the stay of such vessel in a port in the course of such a voyage, any case of plague. I.-Flags to be hoisted by vessels infected with plague. 1. (a) The master of every vessel infected with plague shall, when within three miles of the coast of any part of the Madras Presi- dency, cause to be hoisted at the foremasthead the Commercial Code flag Q being a yellow flag, and shall keep the same displayed during the whole time between sunrise and sunset. If any person on board such vessel be at the time sick of the plague, the master shall also hoist the Commercial Code flag R below the yellow flag Q. Any such vessel arriving at a port after dark shall hoist on coming to an anchor one white light at the foremasthead and one red light at the mainmasthead. (b) He shall before arriving at an anchorage free his vessel from bilge water and pass fresh sea water over the parts that have been in contact with such bilge wate 1
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 279 II.-Regulations as to detention by Port Officers. 2. If a Port officer on the arrival of any vessel ascertains from the master of such vessel or otherwise has reason to suspect that the vessel is infected with plague, he shall detain such vessel, and order the master forthwith to moor or anchor the same in such position as may be appointed under regulation 6. 3. While such vessel shall be so detained, no person shall leave the same. 4. The Port officer detaining any vessel as aforesaid shall forth- with give notice thereof and of the cause of such detention to the Sanitary authority of the port. 5. Such detention by the Port officer shall cease as soon as the vessel shall have been duly visited and examined by the Port Health officer or, if the vessel shall, upon such examination, be found to be infected with plague, as soon as the same shall be moored or anchored in pursuance of regulations 6 and 10; provided that, if the examination be not commenced within twelve hours after notice given as aforesaid, the vessel shall, on expiration of the said twelve hours, be released from detention. In such latter case, the Port officer shall send immediate information to the Sanitary authorities of the port to which the vessel is bound or at which she is next about to call. III.-Regulations as to Sanitary Authorities. 6. Every Sanitary authority within whose jurisdiction a port exists shall, as speedily as practicable, with the approval of the Port officer, fix some place where vessels may be moored or anchored for the purpose of regulation ro; and shall make provision for the recep- tion of plague patients and persons suffering from illness removed under regulations 13 and 14. The place to be fixed as aforesaid, where any vessel may be moored or anchored for the purpose of regu- lation lo, shall be some place within the jurisdiction of the Sanitary authority, unless the Local Government otherwise orders, in which case the place so fixed shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be deemed to be within such jurisdiction. 7. It shall be the duty of the Port officer on the approach to the port of an infected vessel to make the fact known to the Port Health officer who shall forthwith visit and examine the vessel, in regard to which such notice shall have been given, for the purpose of ascertain- ing whether she is infected with plague. 8. The Port Health officer if he has reason to believe that any vessel which has arrived or is within the jurisdiction of the Sanitary authority, whether examined by the Port officer or not is infected with
?280 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. plague or has come from a place where plague prevails, shall visit and examine such vessel, for the purpose of ascertaining whether she is so infected; and the master of such vessel shall permit the same to be so visited and examined. 9. If the Port Health officer, on making such examination as aforesaid, whether under regulation 7 or under regulation 8, be of opinion that the vessel is infected, he shall forthwith give a certificate in duplicate in the following form, or to the like effect, and shall deliver one copy to the master and transmit the other to the Sanitary authority. He shall also give immediate information of the arrival of the vessel to the Sanitary Commissioner of Madras.

The master of any vessel so certified to be infected with plague shall thereupon moor or anchor her at the place fixed for that purpose under regulation 6 where she shall remain until the requirements of these regulations have been duly fulfilled. 11. No person shall leave any such vessel until the examination hereinafter mentioned shall have been made. 12. The Port Health officer shall, as soon as possible after any such vessel has been certified to be infected with plague, examine every person on board the same and in the case of any person suffer- ing from plague, or from any illness which the Port Health officer sus- pects may prove to be plague, shall certify accordingly. Every person who shall not be so certified by him shall be permitted to land and shall be detained under observation in a suitable isolation camp or other place for ten days from the date of his landing or from the date of the occurrence of the last subsequent case of plague which may occur among the persons detained in such camp or place, whichever date may be latest, after which he shall be released if certified by the Chief Medical Officer on the spot to be free from plague. 13. Every person certified by the Port Health officer to be suffer- ing from plague shall be removed, if his condition admit of it, to some isolation hospital or other suitable place appointed for that purpose by the Sanitary authority; and no person so removed shall leave such hospital or place, until the Chief Medical officer present at the spot shall have certified that such person is free from the said disease.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 281 If any person suffering from plague cannot be removed, the vessel shall remain subject, for the purpose of this regulation, to the control of the Port Health officer; and the infected person shall not be re- moved from or leave the vessel, except with the consent in writing of the Port Health officer. 14. Any person certified by the Port Health officer to be suffering from illness, which such officer suspects may prove to be plague, may either be detained on board the vessel for any period not exceeding four days, or may be taken, either immediately or at any time within the said period of four days to some hospital, observation camp, or ward or other suitable place appointed for that purpose by the Sanitary authority, and detained there for a period of ten days, in order that it may be ascertained whether the illness is or is not plague. Any such person who, while so detained, shall be certified by a competent Medical officer to be suffering from plague, shall be dealt with as provided by regulation 13. 15. The Port Health officer shall, in the case of every vessel cer- tified to be infected, give such directions and take such steps as may appear to him to be necessary for preventing the spread of infection, and the master of the said vessel shall forthwith carry into execution such directions as shall be so given to him. 16. In the event of any death from plague on board such vessel while detained under regulation 10, the master shall, as directed by the Sanitary authority, or the Port Health officer, either cause the dead body to be taken out to sea and committed to the deep properly loaded to prevent its rising, or shall deliver it into the charge of the Sanitary authority for disposal, if the former procedure be not in accordance with caste or race customs. 17. The master shall cause any articles that may have been soiled with plague discharges to be destroyed, and the clothing and bedding and other articles of personal use likely to retain infection which have been used by any person who has suffered from plague on board such vessel, or who, having left such vessel, shall have suffered from plague during the stay of such vessel in the port to be also destroyed; and if the master shall have neglected to do so before the vessel arrives in port, he shall forthwith, upon the direction of the Sanitary authority or the Port Health officer, cause the same to be destroyed; and if the said master neglect to comply with such direction within a reasonable time, the Sanitary authority shall cause the same to be carried into execution. 18. The master shall cause the vessel to be disinfected and every article therein, other than those last described which may probably be c 36
?282 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. infected with plague, to be disinfected or destroyed, according to the directions of the Port Health officer. 19. Provided facilities exist for obtaining suitable water in the port, the master shall, on the requisition of the Port Health officer, cause all tanks to be completely emptied and cleaned and disinfected in such manner as the Port Health officer may direct. 20. Any mails or cargo which may be brought by any vessel so arriving shall be landed under such precautions as the Port Health officer may deem necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. 21. It will be the duty of the Port officer to facilitate the convey- ance to all vessels detained under regulations 6 and 10 of such supplies of provisions, stores or other articles as may be required by those on board. Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessel, to be subsequently removed by members of their crews. 22. All expenses incurred by any Sanitary authority in carrying out these regulations shall be defrayed from Municipal or District or Taluk funds in such proportions as the District Collector may, subject to the orders of the Local Government, direct. 23. Any person disobeying or contravening any of the foregoing regulations shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and shall be liable on conviction to be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both.

Ordered that the following notification be published in the Fort St. George Gazette, and a copy forwarded to the Government of India for publication in the Gazette of India:- In exercise of the power conferred by Act I of 1870, and with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council, the rules for quarantine against plague made by the Government of Madras under the said Act are hereby cancelled by the Governor in Council. Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897. No. 87. Nos. 1623-26, dated Simla, the 1st June 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. The Secretary to the Government of Madras, Local and Municipal Department. The Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Marine Department. The Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma. I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of Bombay Madras a copy of a translation of the Convention framed at the Sani- Bengal  Burma tary Conference recently held at Venice for the purpose of consi- dering measures to prevent the spread of the plague. 2. The regulations prescribed by the present Convention are based on the conclusions of the Sanitary Conferences of Venice, 1892; Dresden, 1893; and Paris, 1894; these conclusions have been modi- fied to meet the special pecularities of the plague, and in accordance with modern scientific views regarding sanitary precautions for the prevention of the spread of epidemic disease. 3. The following are the most important points in which the pre- sent Convention differs from the previous Conventions on which it is based:- (i) The fact that the period of incubation in the case of plague may be considerably longer than in the case of cholera has led to several important modifications. By the Venice Conference of 1892 the period of incubation for cholera was fixed at five days. Proposals have been made to fix the period of incubation for plague as high as fifteen days, but the period which has been adopted by the Conference for the purpose of the plague regulations, is ten days.
?284 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. (ii) The list of articles of commerce which may be considered "susceptible" has been considerably increased; but it has been left to the option of the Governments concerned to allow or prohibit the importation of the commodities, on the "susceptible" list, no article being subject to abso- lute prohibition. (iii) It provides that the modern principles of disinfection should be substituted for the obsolete system of land quarantine, but, with a view to the protection of countries which may find it difficult to thus protect their borders, each of the Governments who are parties to the Convention is at liberty to close its frontiers to travellers and merchandise. (iv) It embodies the provisions of the Paris Convention on the subject of the regulation of the pilgrim traffic, but in several respects those provisions have been altered in the directions for which the Government of India have con- tended. A separate communication will be sent on this subject. 4. The first chapter of the Convention deals with the measures for the prevention of plague which are to be adopted outside Europe. In the first place, it is laid down that the Governments who adhere to the Convention are to notify to other Governments the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and must communicate to them a statement of the measures of prevention that are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. This requirement as to notifi- cation is, however, subject to certain important conditions. Thus the area to be deemed infected is strictly limited to the actual dis- trict, town, village, etc., where the disease prevails; and no locality is to be deemed infected merely on account of the importation into it of a few cases of plague which have led to no diffusion of the malady. 5. The Regulations next deal with the measures to be taken on the departure of vessels from infected ports. It is laid down that every person sailing on the vessel must be examined on shore imme- diately before embarkation by a medical officer appointed by the Government and that the Consular authority interested in the'ship may be present at the inspection. All infected and suspected articles must be subjected to careful disinfection on shore and in the presence of the Government medical officer in accordance with the rules for disinfection prescribed in Chapter III of the Annexure to the Con- vention and no persons showing symptoms of plague may be per- mitted to embark.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 285 Rules have been issued by the Governments of Bombay, Madras and Bengal under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which have been in force for some time, prescribing precautions to be taken on the departure of vessels. The rules framed by the Government of Bom- bay, which are in force at the ports of Bombay and Karachi, pres- cribe medical inspection and the removal from the vessel of any per- son suspected to be suffering from dangerous epidemic disease. The rules framed by the Government of Madras, which are in force at the principal ports of the Presidency, authorise the grant of a bill-of- health after medical inspection, the removal of any person suspected to be suffering from plague or not to be free from plague infection, and the disinfection of the infected portions of the ship. The rules framed by the Government of Bengal, which are in force at the port of Calcutta, prescribe medical inspection, the removal of persons suffering or suspected to be suffering from plague, and the detention of the vessel from which such persons have been removed for a period of seven days, after the lapse of which the vessel may proceed if no fresh case has occurred. In order that the obligations imposed by the Convention may be fulfilled at an infected port it is essential that the medical inspec- tion and disinfection should be conducted exactly in the manner pre- scribed by the regulations and summarised above. The Government of India consider that it is also desirable that all non-professional attendants and relatives of any persons, who on examination appear to be suffering from plague, shall be prevented from embarking. If after the medical examination has been completed and all the passen- gers and crew are on board, a case of plague occurs, the patient and his non-professional attendants and relations must be landed and isolated on the first opportunity. The ship will then become an infected vessel within the definition given below in paragraph 7. Although the ports of Madras and Calcutta are not infected, the Local Governments have, with the approval of the Government of India, made the special rules for medical inspection referred to above, and in the opinion of the Governor General in Council, it is desirable that they should be assimilated, in the case of vessels sailing for ports out of India, as far as possible to those which will, under the terms of the Convention, have to be adopted at the infected ports of the Bombay Presidency. Bombay I am to request that the rules issued by the Government of Madras Burma may be altered in accordance with these instructions. The rules
?286 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. should be made applicable to all infected ports in the Bombay Presidency. 6. The rules regarding pilgrim-ships which form the next portion of the regulations will, as stated in paragraph 3 above, be dealt with in a separate communication. 7. The regulations for the control of the general traffic in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal are based on the threefold classification of ships into healthy, suspected and infected adopted in the Venice Con- vention of 1892, with the modifications rendered necessary owing to the period of incubation in the case of plague having been fixed at ten days. Healthy vessels are those which have left an infected port for ten days or more and have had no case of plague on board; suspected vessels are those on which, though cases of plague have occurred, no fresh case has occurred within twelve days; and infected vessels are those on which plague has been present within twelve days of arrival. The period of twelve days is arrived at, as in the case of the seven days' period in the Convention of 1892, by adding two days to the period of incubation. A healthy vessel thus becomes entitled to free pratique at a port at which it arrives ten days or more after leaving an infected port, but the adoption of this period has the serious result that fast vessels sailing from Bombay will arrive at the Suez Canal before pratique can be granted. This difficulty has been satisfactorily overcome by permitting healthy vessels to pass through the Canal in quarantine and to complete in the Mediterranean the ten days necessary to receiving free pratique at a port of arrival. Vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine may, subject to the use of electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and passengers may embark in quarantine at that port. The rules for infected and suspected ships follow those of the Venice Convention of 1892. Vessels carrying a doctor and a disinfecting stove are allowed to pass through the Canal in quarantine after, in the case of infected vessels, landing those suffering from plague and persons who have been in actual contact with the sick or with infected articles and after disinfection of the infected compart- ment of the vessel. Vessels without a doctor and disinfecting stove are detained at Moses' Wells. Such vessels if suspected are detained for the period required for disinfection and for ascertaining the con- dition of the ship's health, while, if infected, the passengers are detained on shore under observation for a maximum period of ten days. The medical and sanitary staff at Moses' Wells is to be in- creased for the purpose of carrying out these regulations.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 287 8. The last matter to notice in the chapter of the regulations dealing with the measures to be adopted against the plague outside Europe is that of the measures to be taken in the Persian Gulf. The conclusions of the Conference on this question differ greatly from those embodied in the Paris Convention. Healthy vessels reaching Ormuz before the expiration of ten days since they last touched at a port infected with plague must either complete that period at Ormuz or may, after medical inspection, continue their voyage up the Gulf or the Shatt-ul-Arab, provided they do so in quarantine for such term as is required to complete the ten days. The same provision will apply to suspected vessels, that is vessels on which there has been a case of plague, but no fresh case for twelve days, subject to sub- mission to certain processes of disinfection, etc., at Ormuz; and infected vessels will, after landing their sick, together with those persons who have been in actual contact with them, and after disin- fection of that part of the vessel deemed to be infected, likewise have permission to proceed on their voyage in quarantine. The final arrangements as to the sanitary station at Ormuz are to be a matter of agreement between the Turkish aud Persian Governments, and until these arrangements are completed a temporary sanitary station will be established on one of the islands in the Straits of Ormuz. 9. The second chapter of the regulation deals with the measures to be adopted by the European Governments who have assented to the terms of the Convention. The provisions relating to notification have been mentioned in paragraph 4 above. Allusion has also been made in paragraph 3 to the regulations regarding the importation of merchandise. This matter requires some further notice. The following are the commodities which are classed as susceptible and the import of which may be prohibited: (1) Used body linen, clothes, bedding and other personal effects. (2) Rags, including rags compressed by hydraulic pressure and transported in bales as merchandise. (3) Used sacking, carpets, and old embroidery. (4) Green and untanned hides and skins. (5) Animal refuse, claws, hoofs, horsehair, hair of animals gen- erally, raw silk and wool. (6) Human hair. The prohibition of import is only to be enforced at the option of the Government concerned. The only articles which must of neces- sity be subjected on arrival to any precautionary measures, such as disinfection, are clothing, bedding and similar articles, which have
?288 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. been actually worn or used, and which are carried as ordinary lug- gage, if they have been brought from an infected area and are consi- dered by the local sanitary authority to be contaminated. The Government of India do not consider it necessary to add to the list of articles, the import of which by sea from infected ports into other ports in British India is prohibited in Home Department Noti- fication No. 513, dated the 17th February 1897, and the bringing of which from the Bombay Presidency and Sind into other parts of British India is prohibited in Home Department Notification No. 1033, dated the 22nd March 1897. This remark applies only to the import of articles from the Bombay Presidency and Sind for use in other parts of India. In reciting the obligation imposed on the coun- tries which are parties to the Convention to confine their precau- tionary measures to goods coming from the infected local area, it is stated in Chapter II, section III of the Regulations, that this obligation only exists on the express understanding that the Government of the infected country takes the necessary measures to prevent the exporta- tion of susceptible articles derived from the infected area. In other words, a Foreign Government would be liberty to decline to receive articles classed as susceptible coming from a clean port unless mea- sures are taken in India to prevent the exportation from that port of susceptible articles coming from the infected area. The orders con- tained in the Home Department notifications of February and March last alluded to above only partly fulfil this condition since they only refer to used apparel and bedding, rags, waste paper and used gunny-bags. All Foreign Governments have not, however, availed themselves of the option of prohibiting the import of all the articles classed as susceptible even from Bombay itself, and the decree of the French Government of the 16th April 1897, which was published in the Gazette of India of the 22nd instant under Home Department Notification No. 1545, dated the 21st instant, and is based on the Venice Convention of 1897, only prescribes prohibitory and precau- tionary measures against goods derived from the infected area. The decree only forbids the importation into France and Algeria of rags, animal refuse, claws and hoofs coming directly or indirectly from the infected local area. Raw and manufactured wool is admitted after disinfection, and this restriction is only imposed when the commodity comes directly from the infected area. Used and new linen, wearing apparel, personal effects and bedding and raw hides, coming directly or indirectly from the infected area, are admitted after disinfection. The decree further provides that any vessel coming from an infected area, or having on board any of the articles coming within the des- cription given above may only enter certain specified ports. In these
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 289 circumstances and in view of the optional nature of this part of the regulations, the Government of India do not propose at present to issue orders in addition to the orders of February and March last, with the view of prohibiting the exportation from clean ports of articles included in the "susceptible" list and coming from the Bombay Presidency and Sind. But if the Governments of Madras, Bengal and Burma, after consulting the mercantile community, consider that prohibitive orders should issue with regard to all or any of the susceptible articles for the protection of clean ports, the Government of India will be prepared to consider proposals with this object. It is to be remarked that new gunny-bags are not in the list of articles classed as susceptible by the Conference. 10. The portion of Chapter II which relates to traffic by sea and the measures to be adopted at ports of arrival is of great interest, not only because of its direct bearing on the conditions of intercourse between India and Europe, but also because it contains the conclu- sions of the Conference on the important subject of the quarantine of vessels. The threefold division of vessels, referred to above, is maintained in this chapter. The regulations respecting infected vessels are that the sick are to be landed and isolated, and the remainder of those on board to be subjected, at the discretion of the local author- ity, either to "observation" or to "surveillance" for a period which is not to exceed ten days from the occurrence of the last case of plague. The term "observation" means the detention under obser- vation of the person either on board a ship or in a place of segre- gation on shore. Persons subjected to "surveillance" are not to be isolated, but are to be allowed to proceed at once to their destination where they are to remain under medical supervision. In the case of an infected ship the dirty linen and other effects of the passengers and crew which the local sanitary authorities may consider likely to be contaminated, must be disinfected. So also must the parts of the ship where the sick have resided, and the local authorities may require a more extensive disinfection to be carried out. Lastly the bilge-water must be thrown out after disinfection and fresh drinking-water supplied. In the case of suspected vessels, a medical inspection and the same process of disinfection, discharge of bilge-water and supply of fresh drinking-water is prescribed. It is further recommended that the crew and passengers should be subjected to "surveillance" for a period of ten days from the date of arrival of the vessel. Pratique is to be given at once to healthy vessels, but it is also provided that, at the option of the local authority, the precautionary measures enforced c37
?290 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. in the case of suspected ships, except the disinfection of the vessel, may be required; and it is also recommended that the passengers and crew should be subject to "surveillance" for a period sufficient to complete a term of ten days from the date of departure of the vessel from the infected port. 11. The quarantine rules made by the Governments of Madras, Bengal and Burma under the powers conferred by section 1, Act I of 1870, with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Coun- cil to protect their ports from being regarded by the European powers as infected, prescribe fifteen days' quarantine for all vessels in which a case of plague is found on arrival, or on which it is believed that a case has occurred during the voyage, with this exception that the rules for Calcutta apparently prescribe only eight days' quarantine in the latter case. In the Bombay Presidency all the principal ports are infected and the Government of Bombay have issued special rules regarding inspection, segregation and disinfection at these ports, Under the rules of the other Maritime Governments no communica- tion may be held with other boats or vessels or with the shore whilst the vessel remains in quarantine, but the Health Officer may direct the removal of so many of the passengers and crew as may not be suffering from illness, and whose services may not be required on board, to places of segregation on shore where they are required to complete the period of quarantine. If a case of plague occurs whilst the quarantine is in progress, quarantine recommences for a further period of fifteen days. The period of fifteen days' quarantine was fixed in view of the possibility that some of the Governments in Europe might not regard quarantine as effective if it were prescribed for a shorter period, but now that the Conference has authoritatively pronounced that the period of incubation may be taken at ten days, the period of observa- tion should be reduced from fifteen to ten days. The quarantine rules in the case of vessels on which there is a case of plague at the time of arrival, or on which it is believed that a plague case has occurred during the voyage, should also be modified in accordance with the regulations framed by the Conference for infected vessels. The Government of Madras have already revised their rules in a similar direction. The Governor General in Council lays special stress upon the undesirability of detaining the sick and healthy on boardship to- gether. The sick should be landed and treated in an isolation hospi- tal and the healthy should be landed and detained under observation in suitable segregation shelter for a period of ten days from the occur- rence of the last case. The disinfection and other precautionary measures prescribed by the Conference should also be complied with,
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 291 12. The quarantine rules framed by the Maritime Governments differ somewhat from one another as regards the treatment of vessels on which no case of plague has occurred during the voyage. Their general purport is to the effect that eight days' quarantine may be imposed at the absolute or limited discretion of the Health Officer unless pratique has been granted at Colombo or some other inter- mediate port. The maximum period of detention of a vessel on which the Health Officer is satisfied that no case of plague has occurred should be ten days from the date of departure from the infected port. If the Health Officer is not satisfied that there has really been no case on board or if ten days have not elapsed since the date of departure from the infected port, the vessel may be detained, at his discretion, up to this period. In any case in which a vessel is given free pratique less than ten days after her departure from the infected port, the Health Officer should be empowered, on the analogy of the rules for the observation of persons travelling by railway which have been framed by several of the Local Governments, to detain under observation in a suitable place of segregation, up to a maximum of ten days from the date of departure of the vessel, any person landed from the ship whom he may consider to be in any way likely to carry infection. Any articles of clothing or other effects belonging to the persons detained or to other persons which by reason of their dirty condition or otherwise may be considered likely to be contaminated, should be disinfected. Discretion may be given to the Health Officer to apply the other provisions regarding disinfection, etc., prescribed by the Convention in the case of suspected ships. The Local Government may also make such arrangements as are possible for the surveillance of persons who are not detained, on arrival at their destination. Free pratique granted at Colombo or other intermediate port should be recognised. I am to request that, with permission of His Excellency the Governor of/His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Bombay/Madras/Bengal/Burma, the quarantine rules in force in Bombay/Madras/Bengal/Burma may be modified in accord- ance with the above remarks, and that a copy of the revised rules may be forwarded to this Department for insertion in the Govern- ment of India Gazette. 13. The Government of Bombay have at present under consider- ation the revision of the rules for the port of Aden. In making this revision the conclusions of the Conference should be borne in mind. In view of the position of Aden as the port of call for Europe the

GENERAL RULES FOR   THE   PREVENTION OF   THE INTRODUCTION AND SPREAD OF THE PLAGUE. CHAPTER I. Measures to be taken out of Europe. I. NOTIFICATION. The Government of each country which adheres to the present Convention will notify to the Governments of the other countries, by telegram, the appearance of any case of plague in their territories in accordance with section I, Chapter II, "Measures to be taken in Europe." Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the same chapter are also applic- able out of Europe. It is also desirable that the measures prescribed for countries in Europe in order to keep the signatories of the Convention informed of an outbreak of the plague, and also the means adopted to prevent its propagation, and importation into uninfected countries, should be applied in other countries.

MEASURES APPLICABLE BOTH TO ORDINARY VESSELS AND TO PILGRIM SHIPS. 1.  Compulsory individual medical inspection, by day, on shore,  at the time of embarkation, during such period as may be   necessary,   by a doctor appointed by public authority, on each person sailing on the ship. The Consular authority interested in the ship may be present at this inspection. 2.  Compulsory and rigorous   disinfection,  on    shore,   under   the superintendence   of    a doctor  appointed   by   public    authority,   of every contaminated or suspected article in the manner  prescribed   in paragraph 5, Chapter III of the annexure to this Convention. 3.  Prevention of the embarkation of any person showing symptoms of plague. PILGRIM SHIPS. 1.  When there   is   plague  in the   port,   embarkation  on   board pilgrim ships must not take place, until the pilgrims collected in groups have been subjected to an inspection sufficient to ascertain that none of them are suffering from plague. It is to be understood that in carrying out this measure each Gov- ernment may take into account local considerations and conditions.* 2.  Pilgrims must possess the means absolutely  necessary  for  the accomplishment of the   pilgrimage, for the voyage out and   for the return voyage and for the sojourn in the holy places, if local  circum- stances permit of this rule being enforced. MEASURES TO BE TAKEN ON BOARD PILGRIM SHIPS. SECTION I.-General Rules.

The persons charged with the care of plague patients may alone have access to them, and the sick must not be brought into contact with the other passengers. All bedding, carpets and clothes which have been in contact with the sick should be immediately disinfected. The observance of this rule is specially enjoined in the case of the clothes of persons attending the sick, which may have been con- taminated. Those of the abovementioned articles which are not valuable should be thrown overboard, if the ship is not in harbour or in a canal, or else burnt. Other articles should be carried to the stove in impermeable bags washed in a solution of corrosive sublimate. The excreta of patients must be received in vessels containing a disinfecting solution. These vessels should be emptied into the latrines, which must be rigorously disinfected after each discharge of matter. * The Conference having learned the nature of the ho pital accommodation which must be provided in accordance with rule 53 of the rules framed under the Pilgrim Ships Act by the Government of India, recommend their adoption in substitution for article 24. Extract :- The hospital accommodation shall be provided on the upper deck either in the poop or in a deck-house. A permanent hospital shall be provided containing not less than six bunks, and having a deck area of at least 144 superficial feet and dimensions of not less than 864 cubic feet. On every pilgirim ship on which there are 50 or more female pil- grims, there shall be a separate permanent hospital, containing not less than two bunks with a deck area of at least 72 superficial feet and dimensions of not less than 288 cubic feet, which shall be reserved for the use of women an 1 children under 12 years of age. The hospitals shall be lighted and ventilated to the satisfaction of the Inspector and shall be proivided with permanent raised floors or platforms at least 4 inches off the deck. They shall be made as secure as any other duck-house, and the roof shall be well caulked and covered with painted canvas. No case of small-pox, cholera, yellow fever or plague shall on any account be treated in a permanent hospital. Materials shall be carried for the construction on the upper deck of a separate temporary hospital for the treatment of such cases of sickness as it may be considered desirable specially to segregate (such as small-pox, cholera, yellow fever or plague). The part of the upper deck upon which such hospital shall, if required, be erected shall be pointed out by the Inspector. It shall be constructed on the same principles as the permanent hospital, and the superficial area of the floor shall not be less than 144 square eet.

Art. 42.-These rules must be posted up in the language of the nationality of the ship, and in the languages commonly spoken by the pilgrims, in a conspicuous and accessible place, on board every pil- grim ship. III. MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE IMPORTATION OF PLAGUE. (1)  BY LAND. The measures to be taken, on land, with respect to travellers and goods from regions infected with plague, should conform to the sanitary principles laid down in this Convention. Modern methods of disin- fection should be substituted for land quarantine. For this purpose stoves and other means of disinfection should be established at selected posts on the routes followed by travellers. Similar methods should be adopted on railways, constructed or in course of construction. Merchandise should be disinfected according to the principles adopted by this Convention. Each Government is at liberty to close its frontiers to passengers and goods. (2)   BY SEA. A.-MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN THE RED SEA. Art. 1.-Healthy ships.-(a) After the medical inspection, ships passed as healthy, will be allowed to proceed at once, whatever the nature of their bill-of-health. The ship must, however, have completed, or must complete, ten full days from the date of departure from the last infected port at which she has touched. The only treatment the authorities of the port of arrival may apply to such ships, consists in the measures prescribed for suspected ships (medical inspection, disinfection of soiled linen, pumping out the bilge- water, and substituting good drinking-water for that stored on board). (b) Ordinary healthy ships will be allowed to pass through the Suez Canal, in quarantine. They will complete in the Mediterranean the ten days' period of observation. Ships carrying a doctor and a stove will not be disinfected before the passage in quarantine. Art. 2.-Suspected ships.-Suspected ships are those on board which there have been cases of plague at the time of departure, or during the voyage, but no new case for 12 days. Such ships will be
?APP. IX.]                spread of infection by sea.                         303 treated in a different manner according as to whether or not they have on board a doctor and disinfecting apparatus (stove). (a)   Ships having a doctor and disinfecting apparatus   (stove)   ful- filling the required conditions, will be allowed to pass through the Suez Canal, in quarantine, in accordance  with the rules   prescribed for the passage. (b)   Suspected ships, having neither  doctor nor disinfecting appa- ratus (stove) on board, will, before being allowed to pass through the Canal in quarantine, be detained at Moses' Wells for the  time neces- sary to disinfect soiled   linen,   personal   linen and  other   susceptible articles, and to ensure that  the ship is in a sanitary condition. Passage in quarantine will be permitted in the case of a mail boat, or steamer specially adapted for passengers without a disinfecting apparatus (stove), but with a doctor on board, if the local authority is satisfied by an official statement, that sanitary measures and measures of disinfection have been properly carried out, either at the time of departure, or during the voyage. Free pratique may be given at Suez, after disinfection, in the case of mail boats or steamers specially adapted for passengers without a disinfecting apparatus (stove) but with a doctor on board, if the last case of plague took place more than 14 days before the date of arrival and if the sanitary state of the ship is satisfactory. In the case of a steamer having a healthy passage of less than 14 days, passengers for Egypt will be disembarked at Moses' Wells and isolated for the time necessary to complete ten days; their soiled linen and personal effects being disinfected. They will then obtain free pratique. Steamers having a healthy passage of less than 14 days and requiring free pratique for Egypt will be detained at Moses' Wells for the time necessary to complete ten days; they will undergo the prescribed disinfection. Art. 3.-Infected ships, that is to say, those with plague on board, or on which cases have occurred within 12 days. These are divided into ships with a doctor and disinfecting apparatus (stove), and those without a doctor, and without a disinfecting apparatus (stove). (a) Ships without a doctor and a disinfecting apparatus (stove) will be detained at Moses' Wells and persons suffering from plague will be disembarked and isolated in a hospital. The disinfection will be thoroughly carried out. The other passengers will be disem- barked, and isolated in as small groups as possible, so that if plague breaks out in one group, the whole party will not be affected. The soiled linen, personal effects and clothes of the crew and passenger, and the ship, will be disinfected.

It is to be understood that this does not require the discharge of the cargo, but only the disinfection of that part of the ship which has been infected. The passengers will remain ten days at the quarantine station at Moses' Wells; when the cases of plague have occurred several days previous to arrival, the term of isolation will be diminished and will vary according to the date of the occurrence of the last case. Thus if the last case occurred 9, 10, 11 or 12 days before arrival, the term of observation will be 24hours; if it took place 8 days before arrival, the observation will be for 2 days; if it took place 7 days before arrival, it will be for 3 days; and so on according to the table given below. (b) Ships with a doctor and disinfecting apparatus (stove).-Ships with a doctor and disinfecting apparatus will be detained at Moses' Wells. The ship's doctor will state, on oath, what persons on board are suffering from plague. These patients will be disembarked and segre- gated. After their disembarkation, the soiled linen of the other passengers and of the crew will be disinfected on board. If the plague has only attacked the crew, the disinfection will be confined to the soiled linen and bedding of the crew. The ship's doctor will also declare, on oath, the portion or com- partment of the ship occupied by the patient or patients, and the section of the hospital to which they were removed. He will also state, on oath, what persons have been in contact with the plague patients, since the appearance of the malady, either directly or by contact with objects capable of transmitting infection. These persons only will be considered as suspected. The part or compartment of the ship, and the section of the hospital in which the patients have been located, will be thoroughly disinfected. By " the part of the ship " is meant the cabin of the patient, the adjoining cabins, the passage to these cabins, the deck, and the parts of the ship in which the patient or patients have been lying. If it is impossible to disinfect the part or the compartment of the ship, which has been occupied by persons attacked by the plague, without disembarking the persons declared to be suspected, these per- sons will either be put on another ship specially set apart for this pur- pose, or will be disembarked and detained in the quarantine buildings, but not in contact with the patients, who will be placed in the hospital.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 305 The duration of this detention on board, or on land, for the pur- pose of disinfection, will be as short as possible, and must not exceed 24 hours. The suspected persons will be kept under observation either on their own ship, or on a ship provided for this purpose ; the duration of this observation will vary according to the following table :-- When the last case of plague occurred on the 1 2th, 11th,   10th  or 9th  day before arrival at Suez.  The observation will be for 24 hours.  If it has occurred on the 8th day before arrival at Suez ...  2 days. ,, ,, ,, 7th ,, ,, ,, 3 ,, ,, ,, ,, 6th ,, ,, ,, 4 ,, ,, ,, ,, 5th or 4th day ,, ,, 5 or 6 ,, ,, ,, ,, 3rd or 2nd ,, ,, ,, 7 or 8 ,, ,, ,, ,, 1st day ,, ,, 9 ,, Passage in quarantine may be permitted before the expiration of the periods stated in the above table, if the sanitary authority deems it possible ; it will, in any case, be permitted on the completion of the disinfection, if the ship leaves behind, in addition to the sick, the persons classed above as suspected. A pontoon, with a stove on board, may be brought alongside the ship to hasten the process of disinfection. Infected ships seeking free pratique in Egypt will be detained for ten days at Moses' Wells, dating from the last case on board, and will undergo the prescribed disinfection. The time taken in disinfecting is included in the term of obser- vation. organisation for carrying out the measures of observation and disinfection at suez and at moses' wells. 1. The medical inspection, prescribed by the regulations, of every ship arriving at Suez will be made by one of the doctors of the station. Arrivals from infected ports will be inspected by day. 2. There will be seven doctors-a Principal Medical Officer, four doctors and two assistants. Should this medical staff be found in- sufficient, the services of the naval doctors of the different Powers will be utilised, under the orders of the Principal Medical Officer of the sanitary station. 3. The medical officers must have a regular diploma, and should be selected from amongst those who have gone through a special course of epidemiology and bacteriology. C 39

The pay of the assistants will be at the  rate   of   6,000   francs a year, the pay of the four doctors will be at the  rate of 8,000   francs a year, rising to 12,000  francs,   and the pay of   the Principal   Medical Officer will rise from 12,000 to 15,000 francs. 6.  The   disinfecting   and   quarantine   station   of Moses' Wells is under the authority of the Principal Medical Officer at Suez. 7.  When patients are disembarked at this place, two of  the   Suez doctors will be posted there,   one   to   tend  the plague   patients,   the other to tend persons not suffering from the plague. 8.  The number of sanitary guards will be 20.    One   of  them will be in special charge of the disinfecting apparatus at Moses' Wells. 9. The disinfecting   and   quarantine  station of Moses' Wells will be provided with- (1)   At least three disinfecting stoves, of which one will be placed on board a pontoon. (2)    A new segregation hospital  containing   12 beds, for the sick and suspected. This hospital will be so arranged that the sick and suspected,  and men and women, can be separately segregated. (3)   Barracks, hospital tents, and ordinary tents, for the use of the persons disembarked. (4)  A sufficient number of baths and washing-places. (5)  The buildings required for the usual offices, the medical staff, the guards, etc.; a magazine and a laundry. (6)  A reservoir for the water-supply. The passage, in quarantine, of the Suez Canal. 1.  Permission to pass the  Canal   in quarantine   is   granted by the sanitary authority at Suez; the Board must be immediately   informed when such permission is given.    In doubtful cases, the decision rests with the Board. 2.  A telegram must be at once sent to the authority appointed by each Power.    The telegram will be sent at the expense of the ship. 3.  Each Power will prescribe penal rules for those vessels,   which depart from the course declared   by the   captain, and enter   without license one of the ports of  that Power.    Exception will  be made in the case of absolute necessity or if the vessel is compelled to put into port for shelter.

The fol- lowing questions will be put to the captains of all ships arriving at Suez from the south and must be answered on oath:- Have you   any  supernumeraries,   stokers  or   other   hands not included in the ship's roll or in the special register ? What is their nationality? Where did you embark them ? The sanitary doctors must satisfy themselves as to the presence' of these supernumeraries, and if they find that any of their number are missing, they must inquire carefully into the cause of their absence. 4.  A sanitary officer and two sanitary guards will go on board, and accompany the ship as far as Port Said; their duty is to prevent com- munication, and to see to the   execution   of the   measures   prescribed for the passage of the Canal. 5.  Passengers may embark   at   Port  Said,   in quarantine,   but all embarkation and disembarkation,   and   all  transfer of  passengers or cargo, is forbidden during the passage of the Canal from Suez to Port Said. 6.  Ships   passing,   in   quarantine,   must   make   the journey   from Suez to Port Said without trying up. In case of the vessel running aground, or being compelled to tie up, the necessary operations must be carried out by the staff of the ship, all communication with the staff of the Suez Canal Company being avoided: Transports passing through in quarantine must do so  only by day. If they are compelled to pass a night in the   Canal, they must anchor in Lake Timsah. 7.  Ships passing in quarantine are forbidden to stop at Port Said, except in the cases provided for  in paragraphs 5 and 8.    The opera- tion of  revictualling must be carried out with the means on board. All stevedores and other persons who have come on board the ship will be isolated on the quarantine pontoon. Their clothes will there undergo the prescribed disinfection. 8.  When it is absolutely necessary for ships, passing in quarantine, to coal at Port Said, they must do so at  a   place, to  be   fixed   by the Sanitary Board, where the   necessary isolation   and   sanitary   super- vision can be secured.    When effective supervision is possible, and all contact with the people on board can be avoided, the coaling  may  be

Measures to be taken in the case of ships arriving in Egypt from an infected port by way of the Mediterranean. 1.  Ordinary healthy ships, coming from a European   or Mediter- ranean infected port, wishing to pass the Suez Canal, will  be allowed to do so in quarantine.    They will continue their  voyage,   remaining under observation for ten days. 2.  Ordinary healthy ships, wishing to land in Egypt, can put in at Alexandria or Port  Said,   where  the   passengers   will complete   the period of observation, either on board, or in the Lazaretto   of Gabari, as the local sanitary authority may direct. 3.  The measures to be taken as   regards   infected  and   suspected ships, coming from an infected European or Mediterranean port,   and desiring to call at an Egyptian port, or to pass  the   Suez   Canal,   will be settled by the Sanitary Council, in accordance with the regulation adopted by this Convention. These measures must, before they can be carried out, be accepted by the different Powers represented on the Board. They will regulate the conditions to be imposed with regard to ships, passen- gers and goods. The Board will, similarly, submit to the Powers a code of rules dealing with cholera. These two codes should be submitted as soon as possible. Sanitary supervision of Pilgrims in the Red Sea.

The dura- tion of these operations, including the disembarkation, and embarka- tion, should not exceed 72 hours. If no case of plague is reported during the operations, the pilgrims will be re-embarked immediately, and the ship will proceed to the Hedjaz. Suspected ships, that is to say, those which have had a case of plague on board, at the time of departure or during the voyage, but no fresh case for 12 days, will be treated as follows: the pilgrims will be disembarked; they will wash or take a bath in the sea; their soiled linen, and any portion of their personal effects or baggage, open, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, to the suspicion of being contaminated, will be disinfected, the bilge-water will be pumped out; and the parts of the ship inhabited by the sick will be disin- fected. The duration of these operations, including the disembarkation and embarkation, should not exceed 72 hours. If no case of plague is reported during the operations, the pilgrims will be immediately re-embarked, and the ship will proceed to Jeddah, where a second medical inspection will take place on board. If the result is favour- able, and the ship's doctor declares on oath that there has been no case during the passage, the pilgrims will be at once disembarked. If, on the contrary, any cases of plague have occurred during the voyage or on arrival, the ship will be sent back to Kamaran, where she will undergo the treatment for infected ships. Infected ships, that is to say, those having cases on board, or having had them within 12 days, will undergo the following treat- ment:- The plague patients will be disembarked and segregated in the hospital. The disinfection will be thoroughly carried out. The other passengers will be disembarked and isolated, by groups, as small as possible, so that if the plague breaks out in one group, the whole party will not be affected. The soiled linen, the personal effects, and the clothes of the crew and passengers and the ship, will be disinfected. The local sanitary authority will declare if the discharge of the heavy baggage and cargo is necessary, and if the whole ship must be disinfected, or a portion only. The passengers will remain at Kamaran for 12 days; when the cases of plague occurred several days before arrival, the period of isolation may be diminished and it may vary according to the date of occurrence of the last case, and the orders of the sanitary authority.

It is desirable that the arrangements at Abu-Sad, Vasta and Abu-Ali should be completed as soon as possible. Reorganisation of the sanitary station of Jebel-Tor. The Conference confirms the recommendations and views expressed on previous occasions and   leaves to   the   Sanitary Board   the   duty of carrying out the improvements.    The Conference also considers- 1. That it is necessary to supply the  pilgrims with good drinking- water, either from a local source or by distillation. 2.  That it is desirable that   all  food   imported  by   pilgrims from Jeddah and from Yembo, when there is   plague in  the Hedjaz, should be disinfected as a suspected commodity, or completely  destroyed, if it appears to have deteriorated so as to have become dangerous. 3.  That steps should be taken to prevent   pilgrims   bringing  with them leather bottles  from  Jebel-Tor.    They   should   be  replaced by earthenware vessels or by metal cans. 4.  That each section should be provided with a doctor. 5.

(2) The Homeward voyage. Art. 1.-Any ship coming from a port of the Hedjaz or from any other port on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, infected with plague having on board pilgrims or any similar collection of persons bound for Suez or for a Mediterranean port, must proceed to El-Tor, there to undergo the prescribed observation as detailed below. The disembarkation and disinfection of passengers, baggage and susceptible goods will then be effected, as well as the disinfection of personal effects, and of the ship. Art. 2.-Ships bringing back pilgrims will only be allowed to pass through the Canal in quarantine. Egyptian pilgrims after leav- ing El-Tor must disembark at Ras Mallap, or some other place appointed by the Sanitary Board, there to undergo three days' observa- tion and a medical inspection, before being given free pratique. In the event of a suspicious case occuring on board during the voyage from El-Tor to Suez, the ship will be repulsed to El-Tor. Art. 3.-Agents of navigation companies and captains of ships are warned that, after the completion of the observation at the sani- tary station of El-Tor and at Ras Mallap, only Egyptian pilgrims will be permitted to leave the ship, in order to return to their homes. Only pilgrims with a certificate of residence, issued by an Egyptian authority, and in accordance with the prescribed form, will be recog- nised as Egyptians or as residents of Egypt. Specimens of this form will be deposited with the consular and sanitary authorities of Jeddah and Yembo, where agents and ships' captains can inspect them. Non-Egyptian pilgrims, such as Turks, Russians, Persians, Tuni- sians, Algerians, Moors, etc., may not, after quitting El-Tor, be dis- embarked in an Egyptian port. Navigation companies' agents and captains are, therefore, warned that the transhipment of non-Egyp- tian pilgrims, either at Tor, Suez, Port Sad, or Alexandria, is for- bidden. Vessels having on board pilgrims belonging to the nationalities mentioned in preceding paragraph will be treated according to the rules for non-Egyptian pilgrims, and will not be permitted to enter any Egyptian Mediterranean port. Art. 4.-If it is not reported that plague exists in the Hedjaz, or has existed during the pilgrimage, vessels will be subjected, at Jebel- Tor, to the rules prescribed at Kamaran for healthy ships. c 40

If plague is reported to exist in the Hedjaz or to have existed during the pilgrimage, vessels will be subjected, at Jebel-Tor, to the rules prescribed at Kamaran for infected ships. The plague patients will be disembarked, and isolated in the hos- pital. The disinfection will be thoroughly carried out. The other passengers will be disembarked, and isolated by groups, as small as possible, so that if the plague breaks out in one group the whole party will not be affected. The soiled linen, personal effects, and clothes of the crew and passengers, and the ship, will be disinfected. The local sanitary authority will declare if the discharge of the heavy baggage and cargo is necessary, and if the whole ship must be disinfected, or a portion only. All the pilgrims will be kept under observation for 12 full days, counting from the day on which the operation of disinfection was com- pleted. If a case of plague occurs in any of the groups, the period of 12 days commences for that group from the day on which the last case in the group is reported. Art. 5.-Ships coming from an infected port of the Hedjaz or from any other port on the Arabian Red Sea coast without having embarked pilgrims or any similar collection of persons and without having had any suspicious cases during the voyage, are placed in the category of ordinary suspected ships. They will be subjected to the preventive measures and treatment laid down for such ships. If they are bound for Egypt, they will be kept under observation, at Moses' Wells, for ten days, counting from the date of departure, and will, in addition, be subjected to all the measures laid down for suspected ships (disinfection, etc.), and will only be given free pratique after a favourable medical inspection. It is to be understood that if these ships have had any suspicious cases during the voyage, they will be placed under 12 days' observa- tion at Moses Wells. Art. 6.-Caravans of Egytian pilgrims must, before entering Egypt, undergo rigorous quarantine at El-Tor for 12 days; they will then be sent to Ras Mallap, and there kept under observation for 5 days, after which they will only be granted free pratique after a favourable medical inspection, and disinfection of their effects.

The trans-shipment of pilgrims is strictly forbidden in Egyptian ports. (2) Ships coming from the Hedjaz or from an Arabian Red Sea port, with a clean bill-of-health, not having on board pilgrims or any similar collection of persons and on which no suspicious cases have occurred during the voyage, will be given free pratique at Suez, after favourable medical inspection. Art. 8.-Ships leaving the Hedjaz with a clean bill-of-health, and having on board pilgrims bound for a port on the African coast of the Red Sea, may call at Suakin, there to undergo three days' observa- tion, all passengers being disembarked and detained in the quarantine encampment. Art. 9.-Caravans of pilgrims arriving by land will be subjected to medical inspection and disinfection at Moses' Wells. Sanitary measures to be taken on the departure for the south of pilgrims from the ports of the Hedjaz. The ports of embarkation should be provided with sufficient sanitary appliances to enable pilgrims returning to their homes to be subjected to measures similar to those which are enforced on the departure of pilgrims from ports beyond the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. The application of these measures will be optional, that is to say that they need not be applied unless the consular authority of the country to which the pilgrims belong, or the doctor of the ship on board which they embark, considers it necessary. B.-MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN THE PERSIAN GULF. I.-Sanitary rules for vessels entering the Persian Gulf. Any ship with plague on board, or on board which one or more cases have occurred within 12 days, will be considered infected. Any ship on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure, or during the voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for 12 days, will be considered suspected. Any ship, even though coming from an infected port, which has had no death, or case of plague on board, either before departure, during the voyage, or on arrival, will be considered as healthy.
?316 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Infected ships will be subjected to the following rules:- (1) The sick will be immediately disembarked and isolated. (2) The other persons on board should also, if possible, be dis- embarked and kept under observation, for a period varying according to the sanitary condition of the ship, and the date of the last case, but which must not exceed ten days. (3) The soiled linen and personal effects of the crew and passen- gers, which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority of the port should be considered as infected, will be disinfected, as also the ship, or the contaminated part of the ship. A more thorough disinfection may be ordered by the local sanitary authorities. Suspected ships will be subjected to the following measures:- (1) Medical inspection. (2) The soiled linen and personal effects of the crew and passengers, which, in the opinion of the local sanitary authority, may be regarded as contaminated, should be disinfected. (3) Disinfection of all parts of the ship which have.been inhabited by patients or suspicious cases. A more thorough disinfec- tion may be ordered by the local sanitary authority. (4) Pumping out the bilge-water after disinfection, and the substi- tution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board. (5) The crew and passengers should be kept under observation for a period of ten days, commencing from the date of the last case on board. Healthy ships will be given free pratique at once, irrespective of the nature of the bill-of-health. Such ships must, however, in all cases, have completed, or must complete, ten full days from the date of departure from the last infected port at which they have touched. The only measures the authority of the port of arrival may apply to healthy ships are those prescribed for suspected ships (medical inspection, disinfection, pumping out the bilge-water, and the sub- stitution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board). It is to be understood that the appointed authority of the port of arrival may always demand a declaration on oath from the doctor, or failing him, from the captain, that there has been no case of plague on the ship since her departure. In deciding on the extent to which effect is to be given to the measures prescribed above, the authorities of the port should take into consideration the fact that there is a doctor or a disinfecting apparatus (stove) on board the ships coming under the three headings mentioned above.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 317 Special measures may be prescribed for ships in an insanitary condition. Goods arriving by sea should be treated in the same way as goods transported by land, as regards disinfection, prohibition of import, transit, and quarantine. Any ship objecting to submit to the obligations imposed by the authority of the port is free to put back to sea. The disembarkation of goods may be authorised after the follow- ing necessary precautions:- (1) Isolation of the ship, crew, and passengers. (2) Pumping out the bilge-water after disinfection. (3) Substitution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board. The disembarkation of passengers wishing to land may also be authorised, on condition that they submit to the measures prescribed by the local authorities. II.-Sanitary posts in the Persian Gulf. There are two places in the Persian Gulf suitable for the estab- lishment of sanitary posts-one in the Straits of Ormuz (the Island of Ormuz, the Island of Kishm, or, failing these, a place to be settled in their vicinity); the other at a place to be settled in the neigh- bourhood of Bassorah. The sanitary post in the Straits of Ormuz should be provided with at least two doctors, sanitary officers and guards and appliances for disinfection. A small hospital should also be constructed. A big lazaretto and apparatus for disinfecting goods should be constructed at the post near Bassorah with a medical staff of several doctors. Before entering the Persian Gulf, ships must touch at the sanitary post in the Straits of Ormuz. They will there be subjected to the sanitary measures prescribed by the rules. If there are any plague cases on board, the sick will be disembarked. Ships wishing to proceed at once up the Shatt-el-Arab will be per- mitted, if the period of observation is not completed, to continue their voyage, through the Persian Gulf and the Shatt-el-Arab in quarantine. A sanitary officer and two sanitary guards, taken on board at Ormuz, will keep a watch on the ship as far as Bassorah, where a second medical inspection will be made, and the necessary disinfection will be carried out. Ships wishing to disembark passengers or goods at Persian ports will be permitted to do so at Bushire, when suitable sanitary arrange- ments have been made; until then, they must land their passengers and goods at Ormuz or Bassorah.
?318 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. It is to be understood that a healthy ship will be granted free pratique at the ports of the Persian Gulf ten days after the date of departure from the last infected ports at which she has touched, pro- vided that she is shown to be healthy on arrival. The sanitary posts at Ormuz and Bassorah will be under the con- trol of the Constantinople Board of Health. The Ottoman and Per- sian Governments will come to an agreement with regard to the post at Ormuz. Until the Ottoman and Persian Governments have arrived at this agreement, a sanitary post will be established as a temporary measure in one of the islands in the Straits of Ormuz, and the Board of Health will post doctors and sanitary guards at this place. These guards will accompany ships passing in quarantine up the Shatt-el- Arab to the post established in the neighbourhood of Bassorah. The Constantinople Board of Health will also organise without delay sanitary posts at Khanikin and Kizil Dize, near Bayazid, on the Perso-Turkish and Russo-Turkish frontiers. CHAPTER II. Measures to be taken in Europe. SECTION I.-Measures to be taken to keep the Governments which are parties to the Convention acquainted with the existence of an epidemic of Plague, and with the means taken to prevent its spread and its importation into healthy countries. Notification and subsequent communications. The Government of an infected country must notify to the other Governments the existence of all cases of plague. This measure is essential. It will only be of real use, if the Government of the infected country is itself informed of cases of plague and suspicious cases occurring in its territory. It cannot, therefore, be too strongly impressed on the different Governments that doctors should be obliged to report all cases of plague. The notification should state the existence of cases of plague, the places where they have occurred, the date of their appearance, the number of cases reported, and the number of deaths. The notification should be made to the diplomatic or consular agents in the capital of the infected country. In the case of countries not represented there, the notification should be made, by telegram, direct to the foreign Governments. This first notification should be followed by subsequent regular communications, with a view to keep the Governments informed of the
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 319 course of the epidemic. These communications should be made at least once a week. The reports concerning the outbreak and course of the disease should be as complete as possible. They should, in particular, state the measures taken to check the spread of the epidemic and should give, in detail, the preventive measures adopted, with regard to- sanitary or medical inspection; isolation; disinfection; and the measures prescribed with regard to the departure of ships, and the export of susceptible articles. It is to be understood that neighbouring countries reserve to them- selves the right to make special arrangements, with the object of organising an exchange of direct information between the principal administrative officers on their frontiers. The Government of each country must publish, immediately, the measures which it decides to adopt with regard to arrivals from an infected country or local area. The information must be at once communicated to the diplomatic or consular agent of the country affected, resident in the capital. In the absence, in the capital, of a diplomatic or consular agency, the communication should be made direct to the Government interested. The withdrawal of the measures, or any modifications which may be made in them, must be communicated in the same manner. SECTION II.-Conditions under which a local area* is to be con- sidered infected or healthy. Any area in which a case of plague has been officially reported to exist will be considered to be infected. Any area in which plague has existed will cease to be considered as infected when it is officially reported that no death or fresh case of plague has taken place for ten days after the recovery or death of the last case, provided that the necessary disinfection has been carried out. Preventive measures will be taken in the infected territory as soon as cases of plague are officially reported. These measures will be discontinued as soon as it is officially stated that the area has again become healthy. * A local area means a portion of the territory of a country placed under a recog- nised administrative authority; as, for instance, a province, a Local Government, a district, a department, a canton, an island, a commune, a town, a village, a harbour, an area reclaimed from the sea, etc., whatever may be the extent and population of the portion of territory.
?320 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. It will not be necessary to apply these measures on the occurrence of a few imported cases if there is no diffusion of the malady. SECTION III.-Necessity of restricting to the infected local areas the measures taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic. The precautionary measures should be confined to the infected tract and the Governments concerned should only apply them to per- sons and goods from infected areas. But the obligation to restrict precautions to the infected area exists only on the express condition that the Government of the infect- ed country takes the necessary measures to prevent the exportation of susceptible articles derived from the infected area. No restrictive measure should be enforced against persons and goods from an infected area, if they left it at least five days before the occurrence of the first case of plague. SECTION IV.-Goods and articles which may be considered "suscep- tible" with reference to the rules regarding the prohibition of import and transit, and the rules regarding disinfection. I-Import and transit. The following is a list of the susceptible articles and goods, the importation of which may be prohibited:- 1. Used linen, clothing, personal effects and bedding. When these articles are carried as baggage, or in consequence of a change of abode (household goods) they are subjected to special treatment. Soldiers' and sailors' kits, returned to their country, after their death, should be treated in the same way as the articles named above. 2. Rags, not excepting rags compressed by hydraulic force, which are carried as merchandise in bales. 3. Old sacking, carpets and old embroidery. 4. Raw hides, untanned and fresh skins. 5. Animals' refuse, claws, hoofs, horse hair, hair of animals gene- rally, raw silk and wool. 6. Human hair. The transit of susceptible goods or articles packed in such a way that they cannot be handled on the way should not be forbidden. Similarly, when merchandise or susceptible articles are transported in such a manner that they cannot have come into contact with infected objects during the journey, their transit throngh an infected local area should not bar their importation into the country to which they are consigned.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 321 The rules regarding the prohibition of the import of susceptible goods and articles will not be applied in cases where it is proved to the satisfaction of the appointed authority of the country to which they are consigned that they were despatched at least five days before the occurrence of the first case of plague. Merchandise must not be kept in quarantine on land frontiers. Absolute prohibition or disinfection are the only measures which may be taken. II.-Disinfection. Baggage.-Disinfection will be compulsory in the case of soiled linen, wearing apparel, clothes and articles carried as personal baggage or household goods, coming from a local area, declared infected, and which the local sanitary authority deems contaminated. Merchandise.-Disinfection will only be enforced in the case of merchandise and articles which the local sanitary authority considers contaminated, or whose importation may be prohibited. It rests with the authorities of the country to which the articles are consigned to settle the manner by which and place in which disinfec- tion should be carried out. The disinfection should be carried out so as to injure the articles as little as possible. Each country will settle the question of the compensation to be paid for damages resulting from disinfection. Letters and correspondence, printed matter, books, newspapers, business documents (not including parcels received through the post), should be subject to no restriction or disinfection. SECTION V.-Measures to be taken on land frontiers. Railway traffic. Travellers. Passenger carriages and mail and luggage vans should not be detained on the frontiers. If a carriage is infected, it should be detached from the train to be disinfected, either at the frontier, or at the nearest stopping place, if this can be arranged. Goods vans should be treated in the same way. Land quarantine will no longer be enforced. Only persons pre- senting symptoms of plague should be detained. This principle does not affect the right of each country to close, if necessary, any part of its frontiers. The railway staff should keep a watch on the travellers' health. Medical intervention will be confined to an inspection of the travel- lers, and the care of the sick. c 41
?322 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Where there is a medical inspection, it will be combined, as far as is practicable, with the custom-house inspection, so as to detain the passengers as short a time as possible. On the arrival of travellers from an infected area at their destination, it will be found very desirable to keep them under supervision for 10 days, counting from the date of departure. The measures to be taken in regard to the crossing of the frontiers by the railway, and the Post Office staff should be settled by the administrations concerned. They should be arranged so as not to interrupt the regular service. Governments reserve to themselves the right to take special measures with regard to certain classes of people, especially- A.-Gipsies and vagabonds. B.-Emigrants and persons travelling or crossing the frontier in large bodies. SECTION VI.-Special rule for Frontier Tracts. The regulation of the frontier traffic, and of the questions involved in this traffic, as well as the adoption of exceptional measures of supervision, must be left to special arrangement between neighbouring countries. SECTION VII.- Water-ways, rivers, canals and lakes. The task of regulating by special arrangements the sanitary rules for water-ways must be left to the Governments of the countries bor- dering such water-ways. SECTION VIII.-Ocean traffic. Measures to be taken at ports. Any ship with plague on board, or on board which one or more cases have taken place within 12 days, will be considered infected. Any ship on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure, or during the voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for 12 days, will be considered as suspected. Any ship, even though coming from an infected port, which has had no death, or case of plague on board, either before departure, dur- ing the voyage, or on arrival, will be considered as healthy. Infected ships are subject to the following rules:- 1. The sick will be immediately disembarked and isolated. 2. The other persons on board should also, if possible, be disem- barked and kept under observation or surveillance * for a period * Note.-The expression "observation" means isolation of the passengers, either on board a ship, or in a lazaretto till they have obtained free pratique. The expression "surveillance" means that the passengers will not be isolated; they will at once obtain free pratique, but on arriving at their destination they will be kept under medical surveillance.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 323 varying according to the sanitary condition of the ship, and the date of the last case, but which must not exceed ten days. 3. The soiled linen and personal effects of the crew and passengers which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority of the port, may be con- sidered as infected, will be disinfected. 4. The bilge-water will be pumped out after disinfection, and good drinking-water will be substituted for the water stored on board. 5. All parts of the ship which have been inhabited by plague patients should be disinfected. More thorough disinfection may be ordered by the local sanitary authority. Suspected ships are subject to the following measures:- (1) Medical inspection. (2) Disinfection; the soiled linen and personal effects of the crew and passengers, which, in the opinion of the local sanitary authority, may be regarded as contaminated, should be dis- infected. (3) Pumping out the bilge-water after disinfection, and the substi- tution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board. (4) Disinfection of all parts of the ship which have been inhabited by plague patients. More thorough disinfection may be ordered by the local sanitary authority. It is recommended that a watch should be kept over the health of the crew and passengers for ten days from the date of arrival of the ship. It is also recommended that the crew should not be allowed to land, except on duty. Healthy ships will be given free pratique at once, irrespective of the nature of the bill-of-health. The only measures which the authorities of the port of arrival may enforce with regard to such ships consist in those which are prescribed in the case of suspected ships (medical inspection, disinfection, pump- ing out the bilge-water, and the substitution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board), except that the measures prescribed for the disinfection of the ship itself may not be enforced in the case of healthy ships. It is recommended that the crew and passengers should be kept under medical supervision for ten days from the date on which the ship left an infected port. It is also recommended that the crew should not be allowed to land except on duty. It is to be understood that the appointed authority of the port of arrival may always demand a declaration, on oath, from the doctor
?324 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. of the ship, or failing him, from the captain, that there has been no case of plague on the ship since her departure. In deciding on the extent to which effect is to be given to the measures prescribed above, the authorities of the port should take into consideration the fact that there is a doctor, or a disinfecting appara- tus (stove) on board the ships coming under the three headings men- tioned above. Special measures may be prescribed for crowded ships, particularly for emigrant ships, or any other ship which appears to be in an insanitary state. Goods arriving by sea should be treated in the same way as goods arriving by land, as regards disinfection, prohibition of import, transit, and quarantine. Any ship objecting to submit to the obligations imposed by the authority of the port will be free to put back to sea. The disembarkation of goods may be authorised, after the following necessary precautions have been taken:- (1) Isolation of the ship, crew and passengers. (2) Pumping out the bilge-water after disinfection. (3) Substitution of good drinking-water for the water stored on board. The disembarkation of passengers wishing to land may also be authorised on condition that they submit to the measures prescribed by the local authorities. Each country should supply at least on port on each of its seaboards, with the organisation and equipment necessary to enable it to receive a ship, whatever its sanitary state. Coasting vessels will be subject to special rules, to be drawn up conjointly by the countries concerned. SECTION IX.-Measures to be taken with regard to ships coming from an infected port and ascending the Danube. Until the town of Sulina is provided with good drinking-water, the sanitary condition of ships ascending the river will be subject to thorough sanitary supervision. Overcrowding of passengers will be strictly forbidden. Ships entering Roumania by the Danube will be detained for medical inspection, and until disinfection has been completed. Ships arriving at Sulina must, before being permitted to ascend the Danube, undergo one or more medical inspections by day. Each morning, at a given hour the doctor will satisfy himself as to the state of health of all persons on the boat, and will not permit it to enter the
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 325 river, until he is assured that their condition is satisfactory. He will deliver, free of charge, to the captain or master, a sanitary passport, bill-of-health or certificate, the production of which will be demanded at the subsequent stations. There will be a daily inspection. The detention at Sulina of healthy ships will not exceed six days. Contaminated clothes will be disinfected on arrival. Drinking-water of good quality will be substituted for water of questionable quality that may be on board. The bilge-water will be disinfected. The measures above indicated will only be applied to arrivals from ports infected with the plague. It is to be understood that a ship coming from a healthy port may, if it does not wish to submit to the restrictive measures indicated above, refuse to embark travellers from an infected port. The rules for suspected and infected ships will be the same as at other European ports. CHAPTER III. Instructions regarding the method of disinfection. 1. Personal effects, rags, infected bandages, papers, and other articles without value should be destroyed by fire. 2. Under-clothing, bedding, wearing apparel, mattresses, carpets, etc., which are contaminated or suspected should be disinfected in stoves at normal pressure, or at a pressure of from one-and-a-half to two degrees, with or without the presence of steam. Before a stove is passed as efficient for the purposes of disinfec- tion, it should be subjected to a test, with the aid of a signal ther- mometer, showing the moment when the temperature in the middle of a mattress rises to at least 100 (Centigrade). To ensure that the disinfection is effective, this temperature must be maintained for from 10 to 15 minutes. 3. Disinfecting solutions- (a) Solution of corrosive sublimate, of 1 part in 1,000, with the addition of 10 parts of chloride of soda. The solution should be coloured with aniline dye or indigo. It should not be placed in metal vessels. (b) A 5 per cent. solution of pure crystallized carbolic acid, or 5 per cent. of crude commercial carbolic acid, in a warm solution of soft soap.
?326 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. (c) Fresh slaked lime.* 4. Special instructions to be observed in the employment of dis- infecting solutions. The linen, clothing and articles soiled by the excreta of patients should be soaked in the solution of corrosive sublimate. The solution of pure carbolic acid, and the solution of soap and carbolic acid are equally suited to the purpose. The articles should remain in the solu- tion for at least six hours. Articles which cannot be subjected to the temperature of the stove (100 Centigrade) without injury, such as leather goods, wooden articles stuck together with glue, felt, velvet, silk, etc., should be washed with the solution of corrosive sublimate; coins can be dis- infected with the solution of soap and carbolic acid. Persons engaged in nursing the sick should wash their hands and faces with the solution of corrosive sublimate, or with one of the carbolic solutions. The carbolic solutions will be useful more particularly for dis- infecting articles, such as metals, instruments, etc., which can neither be subjected to a temperature of 100 Centigrade, nor placed in con- tact with corrosive sublimate. Slaked lime is particularly recommended for disinfecting excreta. Expectorated matter should be burnt. 5. Disinfection of ships with plague patients on board. The cabin or cabins, and all parts of the ship occupied by the sick or suspected, should be cleared out and all articles in them should be treated as described above. The partitions should be disinfected with the solution of corrosive sublimate with an addition of 10 per cent. of alcohol. The washing should commence from the top, horizontally, and be continued down- wards, so that the whole surface of the partition becomes covered with a coating of minute drops. The boarding should be washed with the same solution. Two hours after, the walls and flooring should be washed over with plenty of water. 6. Disinfection of the hold of an infected ship. * To get very strong slaked lime, take lime of good quality, slake it, by moisten- ing it gradually, with half its weight of water. When the operation is completed, put the powder in a carefully corked receptacle, and place it in a dry spot. As each kilo- gramme of lime absorbs 500 grammes of water in order to become slack, it acquires a volume of 2 litres 200, and it is sufficient to dilute it with double its volume of water, say 4 kilogrammes 400 grammes to obtain a whitewash which will be of about 20 per cent. strength of lime.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 327 To disinfect the hold, sulphate of iron, in quantity sufficient to neutralise the sulphurated hydrogen, should first be thrown in, the bilge-water should be pumped out, and the hold washed with sea- water. Solution of corrosive sublimate should then be thrown in. The bilge-water should not be pumped out while the ship is in port. CHAPTER IV. Precautionary measures recommended for ships on departure, during the voyage, and on arrival. Note.-Plague appears to be transmitted by the excretions of the sick (from the air passages and bowels), by the morbid products of the disease (pus), and consequently by means of linen, clothing, and soiled hands. I.-Measures to be taken on departure. 1. The captain should be careful not to embark persons suspected to be suffering from plague. He should refuse to receive on board dirty or suspicious linen, personal effects, and bedding, and, generally, all dirty or suspicious articles. Bedding, wearing apparel, personal effects, etc., belonging to persons suffering from plague should not be taken on board. 2. Before embarkation the ship should be put in a state of perfect cleanliness and she should, if necessary, be disinfected. 3. It is essential that the drinking-water taken on board should be obtained from a source free from all possible contamination. Water is not dangerous if it is distilled or boiled. II.-Measures to be taken during the voyage. 1. Every ship should have a special place reserved for the segre- gation of persons attacked by contagious disease. 2. If there is no such place on board, the cabin or other place, in which a person is attacked with plague, should be isolated. Only those attending the patients should be admitted. Such attendants should be cut off from all contact with the other persons on board. 3. The bedding, linen, and clothing which have been in contact with the patient should immediately, and in the patients' room, be soaked in a disinfecting solution. The same measure should be taken in the case of the clothing of the persons who have access to the patient which may have become polluted.
?328 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Articles which are of no value should be burnt, or thrown over- board, if the ship is not in port or in a canal. Other articles should be carried to the stove, in impermeable bags, sprinkled with a solution of corrosive sublimate, so as to avoid all contact with surrounding objects. If there is not a stove on board, the articles should be soaked in the disinfecting solution for six hours. 2. The excreta of the sick should be collected in vessels, into which a glass of the disinfecting solution above described has been previously poured. 3. The vessels should be at once emptied into the latrines which should be disinfected each time. 4. The places occupied by the sick should be carefully disinfected according to the rules previously laid down. 5. Corpses should be wrapped in a shroud impregnated with cor- rosive sublimate and thrown into the sea. 6. All the preventive measures taken during the voyage should be stated in the log, which should be submitted to the sanitary authority immediately on arrival in port. 7. The measures should be applied to everything that has been in contact with the sick, irrespective of the gravity and result of the illness. III.-Measures to be taken on arrival. 1. If the ship is infected, the persons attacked should be disem- barked and segregated in a place set apart for the purpose. Those who have had access to the sick should be considered as suspected. 2. All contaminated objects and articles, such as clothes, bedding, mattresses, carpets, and other articles which have been in contact with the sick, the clothes of those who have been in attendance on them, the articles in the patients' cabin, and in any cabin and on the deck, or parts of the deck where the sick have been placed, should be disinfected. CHAPTER V. Administration and Control. Powers of the Constantinople Board of Health (Red Sea-Persian Gulf-Perso-Turkish, and Russo-Turkish frontiers). I. The execution and control of measures against the spread of plague, prescribed by this Convention, are entrusted, in exercise of the powers of the Constantinople Board of Health, to the Committee
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 329 established by Article 1 of Annexure IV of the Paris Convention of the 3rd April 1894. It should be explained, however, that the mem- bers of this Committee will be taken exclusively from the Constanti- nople Board of Health, and will represent the Powers which have accepted, or may hereafter accept, the Sanitary Conventions of Venice, 1892, of Dresden, of Paris, and of Venice, 1897. 2. The proper working of the various sanitary establishments, prescribed by existing rules, is entrusted to the corps of diplomaed and duly qualified doctors, of disinfecting officers, of experienced sub- ordinates and of sanitary guards rec-uited from among persons who have performed military service as officers or non-commissioned officers, as provided for in Article 2 of Annexure IV of the Paris Convention. 3. The expenses of the establishment of permanent and temporary sanitary posts, as contemplated by this Convention, are, as regards the construction of the buildings, debitable to the Turkish Government. The Constantinople Board of Health is authorised, in case of emer- gency, to advance the necessary money from the reserve fund. In this case, it should supervise the construction of these establishments. 4. The Constantinople Board of Health should also organise with- out delay, the sanitary establishments at Khanikin, and Kizil Diz, near Bayazid, on the Perso-Turkish frontier, out of the funds which are now placed at its disposal. 5. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of Annexure IV of the Convention of Paris of 1894 may be utilised for carrying out the present rules. Powers of the sanitary, marine, and quarantine Board of Egypt. 6. The expenses involved in the measures prescribed for in the rules contained in this Convention may be met by the following measures, which the Conference recommends, not only to meet the new requirements at Moses' Wells, but also to defray the cost of the increase of the staff under the Sanitary Board:- (1) The prorogration, with the consent of the Powers, of the Khedival Decree of 20th December 1896 (fixing the 1st July 1897 as the date for the application of the reduced tariff for lighthouse dues) until the difference betweeen the receipts of the present tariff and the reduced tariff has reached the sum of 4,000 (Egyptian). The sum thus realised will be devoted to extraordinary expenses (new arrangements at Moses' Wells). (2) For ordinary expenses (increase of staff) an annual payment by the Egytian Government to the Sanitary Board of a sum of 4,000 (Egyptian), which can be deducted in advance from the surplus of the lighthouse service fund remaining at the disposal of the Govern- ment. c 42
?330 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. From this sum, however, there will be deducted the value of a supplementary quarantine tax of P. F. 10 (piastres tariff) to be collected from each pilgrim at El-Tor. In the event of the Egyptian Government finding difficulty in meeting its share of the charges, the Powers represented on the Sanitary Board will arrange with the Khedival Government to ensure the participation of the latter in the estimated cost.

The draft rules for the port of Bombay, submitted by the Com- missioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Abkari, comply with the requirements of the Venice Convention, except in one particular: they do not provide that the medical examination of each person sailing shall be on shore. They are, however, in the opinion of this Govern- ment, suitable and effective. 3. The most important to other countries, the most difficult to this Government, of the sanitary measures for ships sailing from infected ports, is the individual medical inspection of each person sail- ing. The labour involved in conducting this inspection is immense. In April and May of this year upwards of 162,000 outgoing persons were medically examined at the port of Bombay. The efficiency of the examination was extraordinary. As far as is known, plague was prevented from entering any ocean-going vessels leaving the port of Bombay, except the pilgrimship Pekin and transport Dilwara: and in the case of the latter vessel the Port Health Officer had not been
APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 331 entrusted with the medical inspection of the class of persons amongst whom plague appeared. The Governor in Council cannot leave this particular aspect of the matter without expressing to His Excellency the Governor General in Council his appreciation of the admirable work done by Dr. MacCartie and his staff during the past six months; and his opinion that by reason of Dr. MacCartie's very wide, probably unique, experience in the matter, that officer's views on medical inspection are entitled to the most earnest consideration. The first point to notice particularly is that in the case of ordinary steamers and especially those sailing to European and Colonial ports, the chief danger of infecting the vessel arises, not from the passen- gers, but from the crew. There seems to be little room for doubt that the expression "each person sailing on the ship" used in the Convention includes the crew. But, however that may be, it is essen- tial that the crew should be inspected; unless the lesser source of danger alone is to be guarded against and the greater left unchecked, But herein lies the absolute impracticability of inspection on shore. The reasons are so clearly pointed out in the papers accompanying this letter that they need no further elaboration. Indeed no statement of reasons is needed to show that in the case of vessels sailing from the stream, the inspection of the crew cannot be on shore at the time of embarkation. The fact is patent. 5. This Government therefore are compelled to ask that the Con- vention should be so modified as to allow of inspection on shore or on board, as the circumstances of any particular port may render necessary. The power of suggesting modifications in the Convention is reserved to the contracting parties. It should, this Government consider, be exercised in this particular instance for two reasons. The first I have already fully explained, it is the practical impossibility of a complete inspection on shore. The second is that there is not neces- sarily any loss of efficiency involved in an inspection on board. Dr. MacCartie shows how time after time he had members of the crew cf a vessel removed for observation, how a certain number eventually de- veloped plague; and yet that on the vessels from which they had been removed no more cases of plague occurred. It seems to be practically demonstrated that the early stage of plague is not one in which the disease is communicable by the patient, and consequently the removal from a vessel of a person suffering at an early stage of the illness accompanied by the removal of those in attendance on him and his and their effects is a thorough safeguard to the vessel and those on board. Even at a more advanced stage effective disinfection of the portion of the vessel a plague patient has been in contact with, in ad- dition to the other measures, would secure the vessel and those on board from danger. As a matter of experience, however, it is found
?332 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. that cases on boardships are discovered at an early stage. These considerations taken with the results of the inspection of outgoing vessels from Bombay throughout the time when plague was at its worst demonstrate that the Bombay method of inspection is not want- ing in efficiency and need not be changed. 6. The argument of expense, though important, is not one which this Government consider it desirable to urge as a ground for modify- ing the provisions of the Convention. They rely on the thorough efficiency of the method practised in Bombay, and on the practica- bility of that provided by the Convention. 7. The Bombay Government agree with Sir James Campbell that when plague cases have become very few in Bombay the inspection rules should be applied to certain classes of vessels only. So long, however, as Bombay remains an infected port, within the meaning of that expression as used in the Convention, individual medical inspection must be made of every person sailing in each vessel pro- ceeding to any port of a country which is a party to the Convention. As regards vessels proceeding to other ports whether within or out- side India, the inspection can be altered or discontinued at will. I am to enquire whether it is the wish of His Excellency the Governor General in Council that no such alterations or discontinuance should be made without previous reference to the Government of India, and to this enquiry I am to request that, if the Government of India see no objection, an answer may be sent by telegram; for it is to be hoped the time is near when the inspection of vessels proceeding from Bom- bay may in some cases be relaxed or discontinued. 8. I am to add that Sir James Campbell appears to be in error in stating (paragraph 10 of his letter No. 3070 of 2nd July 1897) that "under a recent order of the Government of India letter No. 1623, dated 1st June 1897, the Local Government rules regarding the inspec- tion of ships are to be adjusted to the Convention rules." It is under- stood that the order quoted applied only to the assimilation, to the requirements of the Convention, of the rules for the inspection of vessels proceeding to ports out of India from Madras and Calcutta.

From-SIR JAMES MACNABB CAMPBELL, K.C.I.E., I.C.S., Acting Com- missioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Abkari, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. VENICE CONVENTION. PLAGUE INSPECTION BY SEA. Outward and Inward. With the help of Surgeon-Major MacCartie, the Health Officer of the port by whom the rules have been drafted, I have the honour, as directed in your No. 3188 of the 9th June 1897, to furnish the following information.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 333 2. To adjust the procedure at Bombay with that laid down in the Venice Convention, as explained by the Government of India in their letter No. 1623, dated 1st June 1897, two sets of rules A outwards and B inwards are required. 3. The details of rules B inwards are taken from the regulations enforced by Government at Aden and Karachi against arrivals from plague-infected ports. The means of segregation now available in Bombay make it possible to provide for the accommodation and treat- ment of from 600 to 800 infected or suspected arrivals, a total which is not likely to be reached, except at such times as pilgrims from the Hedjaz may be returning to Bombay in infected ships. At the same time it is to be noted that segregation is available only in the city itself. Bombay at present has no means of detaining in any quaran- tine camp outside the city of infected or suspected arrivals. 4. The details of rules A outward are in the main in agreement with the existing procedure in Bombay. With few exceptions the arrangements in force since 6th February last can be continued with such slight modifications as will bring them more exactly in agreement with the conclusions of the Venice Conference. In drawing up these rules we have felt uncertain how far it is the intention of Government to order the inspection of every vessel which leaves Bombay for any port. It seems necessary to leave it open to Government to decide that when plague cases in Bombay have become very few these rules should apply to certain classes of vessels only, say those bound for Europe. 5. The only important exception to the general conformity is that while it has been the practice in Bombay to inspect the passengers and crew of outgoing vessels either on shore or on board, as the other necessary arrangements regarding the departure of the ship made possible, the Convention Rules as noted in Government of India No. 623, of 1st June 1897, paragraph 5, contemplate no inspection of out- going passengers and crews except on shore. 6. An examination of the conditions under which vessels leave Bombay shows that it is not advisable, that it is not even possible, to enforce a rule which makes all outgoing medical inspection an inspec- tion on shore. 7. In Bombay vessels start from one of three places- (1) The outer wall of the dock. (2) The docks. (3) The stream. In the case of vessels starting from the outer wall of the dock the passengers are now, and, since plague inspection was started early in February 1897, have been, inspected on shore in sheds specially
334 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. arranged on the dock wall. The crews of those vessels, that is of vessels that start from outer wall of the dock, are mustered and exa- mined on board before the passengers are allowed to enter the ship. In this way only can the stokers, foreman and other members of the crew who are on duty be inspected without the risk of delay or of accident. It might be possible to arrange to inspect the crew in batches on shore. But the annoyance and risk of such a procedure are clear and the practical merit of the precaution is not apparent since the crew have been already on board, and if one of them on inspection is found to be suffering from plague, he must be considered to have infected the ship. In this connection I would venture to draw attention to the fact that the inspection of the crew is of more importance than the inspection of the passengers. Returns show that of the inspections during April and May 1897 more than one half were inspections of members of crews (86,938 of 161,406). And it is evident that specially in the case of vessels for Europe, the shore life and surroundings of the passengers are more wholesome than those of the crew. 8. The difficulties in the case of No. 2, that is of departures from the dock, are more serious than in the case of No. 1, departures from the dock wall, since these difficulties affect passengers as well as crew. Under the rules no inspection can take place at night. The state of the lading or of the tide not unfrequently compels a vessel to leave the dock at night. Vessels which in any voyage may have to leave the dock by night sometimes carry 500 to 600 passengers. If the passengers and crew have to be inspected on shore a building must be secured in some central position in the docks with separate rooms and retiring rooms for men and for women. Even though necessary quarters are provided a further set of difficulties remain. If the vessel leaves the dock during the night how can the passengers be controlled. The docks are about 13/4 miles round. To use the only available latrines passengers must be allowed to move about the docks. What is to prevent a passenger taking advantage of this freedom to pay a visit in the town? Again when the ship starts what security is there that the passenger who passed sound the evening before is the same passenger who leaves Bombay ? A strong body of special police might help to keep irregularities within bounds. Such a force would be costly and, considering the peculiar characters of the duty, they could hardly be expected to be markedly efficient. These objections are urged in the case of passengers who leave the dock by night. The same objections apply in some details with more, in other details with less force, in the case of crews who start during the night. 9. In the case of No. 3, departures from the stream, the objections to a shore inspection either of passengers or of crew are still stronger.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 335 Separate inspection rooms, perhaps at Ballard pier, would have to be provided, and to control passengers starting from the stream would be still more difficult than to control them during a night departure from the dock. But it is in the case of the crews of the larger vessels leaving Bombay from the stream that the difficulty of arranging a shore inspection practically becomes an impossibility. The India or other large mail steamer in the stream ready to weigh anchor has a crew of 332 men. That the whole of this mass of men can either in block or by detachments be sent on shore for medical inspection is a proposal which, so far as I can judge, is not practicable. Rules, page 3, paragraph I-I. 10. I am therefore hopeful that the principle which the Venice Convention has been pleased to adopt, namely, that each Government may take to account local considerations and conditions, may be declared to include in Bombay such boardship inspection as local circumstances have proved to be necessary. That in fact the concession of board- See General Rules, page 3, Note. ship inspection granted by the Venice Convention in Batavia to pilgrim ships may be applied in Bombay to the less rigid treatment required in the case of ordinary passengers. It may be objected that in Bombay the concession of boardship inspection is unnecessary, seeing that all pilgrims are inspected on shore. The reply is that in Bombay to make the shore inspection of pilgrims possible restrictions regarding the berth occupied and the hour of sailing have to be enfor- ced which could not be made applicable to ordinary passenger ships. 11. The chief argument in support of the concession of board- ship inspection is neither the saving of expenditure nor the smooth- ing of difficulties. The chief argument in its favour is, since its introduction in early February, the notable success of the Bombay system of inspection partly on shore, partly on shipboard. During the past four months the outward plague inspections by sea have been February 79,623, March 91,779, April 80,608, and May 81,398. Of this total of 333,408 inspections in no single case, for the S. S. Dil- wara was inspected by the military authorities, did plague appear after any of the vessels left Bombay. 12. With a record so favourable to the local alternative system I trust Government may be pleased to move the Government of India to allow the existing port-shore, port boardship inspection to continue as the sole concession to the local conditions of Bombay which the experience of several months has shown to be necessary. With this hope I have the honour to forward a set of rules A, out- ward, drafted by Surgeon-Major MacCartie, which I consider will carry out the directions of the Venice Convention, except in as far as in
?336 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. accordance with the existing Bombay practice, they permit inspection on shore or on boardship according to the circumstances of each case. 13. Along with the general summary contained in this letter of the grounds for continuing the system in force in Bombay, I have the honor to submit a memorandum from Dr. MacCartie, stating in detail the evidence in favour of alternative boardship inspection. All the considerations on which the Health Officer of the port lays stress seem to me of practical importance. They form a valuable record of his special experience of the system of inspection required in Bombay to guard against the outward and inward spread of plague by sea. A.-OUTWARD. Rule I.-No vessel shall leave the port of Bombay for any of the following ports. Until she has been inspected by the Health Officer of the port, and the master or person in charge of such vessel has obtained a bill-of-health or certificate from such officer that the master or person in charge, officer and passenger (if any) of such vessel are free from plague: provided that, in the case of a vessel that has called at Bombay from a port outside the continent of India en route for some other port, and which has on arrival a clean bill-of-health and has had no communication with Bombay, except through any person or persons who shall have embarked there, the inspection of such vessel by the Health Officer of the port may be limited to the medical examination of such person or persons so embarked, and the bill-of-health or certificate required by this rule shall only certify that such person or persons is or are free from plague, and such certificate may be in the form of an endorsement on the bill-of-health furnished to the vessel at the last port of call prior to arrival at. Bombay. For the purposes of this proviso the Collector of Customs and the Port Health Officer are empowered to decide what shall constitute communication with Bombay. Rule II.-Should the Health Officer of the port be of opinion that any person on board of, or about to sail on, any vessel so in- spected is suffering from plague he shall refuse to give a bill-of-health or certificate as aforesaid unless and until such person together with his or her attendants and relatives, and their baggage and personal effects have been removed from the vessel, and the vessel has been disinfected in such manner as the Health Officer of the port directs; and such removal and disinfection shall be noted on the bill-of-health. The baggage and effects of such persons as are removed from or
?PP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 337 prevented from sailing in any vessel under this rule shall be dis- infected on shore in such manner as the Port Health Officer directs before such baggage and personal effects are permitted on board any vessel. Rule III.-After the master or person in charge of the vessel has obtained a bill-of-health or certificate under the provisions of these rules, no person or cargo or goods of any kind shall be embark- ed or disembarked before the vessel leaves the port of Bombay, unless such vessel is again inspected by the Port Health Officer and another bill-of-health or certificate obtained from such officer by the master or person in charge of the vessel. Rule IV.-No port clearance shall be delivered to any vessel unless and until the master or person in charge thereof shall produce the bill-of-health or certificate to be obtained as aforesaid, and it shall be the duty of customs officers to refuse delivery of the port clearance until such master or person in charge shall produce such bill-of-health or certificate and such bill-of-health or certificate comes within the provisions of rule V. Rule V.-Vessels not leaving port before 6 A.M. of the day follow- ing the medical inspection may not leave without re-inspection. Rule VI.-The medical inspection of vessels and passengers shall be carried out between sunrise and sunset. Rule VII.-The Government of Bombay may appoint any person or persons by name or by virtue of office, Health Officer or Health Officers of the port for the purpose of these rules as regards any class or classes of vessels and may cancel any such appointment. Rule VIII.-Should the Port Health Officer prevent the embarka- tion or sailing of any persons under these rules, such person or persons may be kept under observation in duly appointed places until free from any suspicious signs or symptoms of plague, and actual plague cases may be removed to such hospitals as are appointed for the purpose. Rule IX.-Disobedience of any of the above rules I, II, III, IV, V, and VIII will subject the offender, and all persons aiding and abetting him to a prosecution under Indian Penal Code. B.-INWARD. In exercise of the power conferred by Act III of 1897, His Excel- lency the Governor in Council is pleased, with the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council to make the following rules and to publish the same for general information. These rules have effect c 43
?338 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. from in the port of Bombay as a temporary measure- I.-The commander of every vessel, including buggalows or other native craft arriving at Bombay from shall, before entering harbour, hoist a yellow flag; or shall, if entering port at night time, show the quarantine light sig- nals, viz., 3 lights, red, white and red at the main. He shall indicate by signal the port from which the vessel has come, and shall keep such flag and signals hoisted until permitted to take them down as hereinafter provided. The pilot on going alongside a vessel from shall direct the flag or lights prescribed above to be hoisted, if this has not already been done. II.-Such commander shall not without first having obtained permission, as hereinafter provided allow any communi- cation except orally, with the shore or with any vessel or board excepting with the boat supplying pilots, and in that case communication shall be limited to receiving on board the pilot, his servant and baggage. III.-On such arrival being signalled the Health Officer of the port shall as soon as possible go alongside the vessel and ascertain by enquiry from the commander, and by careful individual medical examination of the passengers and crew, whether any person on board is suffering or has during the voyage suffered from plague, or whether any death has occurred during the voyage from unknown or suspicious causes. If the Health Officer of the port is satisfied by such enquiry and examination that no per- son on board is suffering, or during the voyage has suffer- ed, from plague, and that no death from unknown or sus- picious causes has occurred during the voyage, and that the vessel has been ten clear days out from pratique shall be given at once, subject to the directions of the Health Officer of the port as to what, if any, proce- dure of disinfection shall be carried out. Should ten clear days not have elapsed between the date of the vessel's departure from and its arrival at Bombay, it will be within the discretion of the Health Officer of the port (to refuse pratique until ten
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 339 clear days have elapsed since the vessel's departure from or until all persons on board have been subjected to me- dical supervision at an appointed place during such period as will complete ten days from the date of the vessel's departure from For the purposes of this rule the Health Officer of the port may domand a declaration on oath from the medical officer or in his absence from the commander that there has been no case of plague on the ship since her departure from IV.-If, as the result of the enquiry and examination made under rule III, the Health Officer of the port shall have reason to believe or suspect that at the time the vessel arrives in the harbour any person is suffering, or during the voyage has suffered, from plague, or that any suspici- ous death has occurred, he shall direct that such person, together with all his or her baggage and personal effects other than such contaminated or infected articles as the Health Officer of the port directs to be destroyed, be removed to such place as is appointed for the purpose, there to remain until permitted to leave by the medical officer in charge of such place. After such removal the Health Officer of the port may direct the commander to take the vessel to such quarantine anchorage as is appointed for the purpose, there to remain for a period of ten days, and he may direct that whilst at the aforesaid anchorage all communication, except such as is herein- after provided, between such vessels and the shore or other vessels or boats in the harbour, shall be prohibited. Under this rule the period of quarantine for vessels which on arrival are found free from cases of plague, but on which a suspicious death has occurred during the voyage should be limited to ten days from the date of such suspicious death. V.-If, during the period, a vessel is at the quarantine anchorage aforesaid any case or cases of plague should occur on board, the said vessel shall remain in quarantine for a period of ten days from the termination of the last case either by death, recovery, or removal from the vessel, and be subject to all the prohibitions provided in rules III and IV.
?340 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. VI.-When any vessel has been placed in quarantine as aforesaid, the Port Health Officer may direct that so many of the passengers and crew as may not be suffering from illness, and whose services may not be required on board, the vessel shall be removed to such place as may be appoint- ed for the purpose there to remain for such time as will complete a period of ten days either from the date of departure from or from the date of the occurrence of the last plague case, and under such directions as the Port Health Officer may lay down as to disinfection of the personal effects of the said passengers and crew. After such removal the vessel and the effects of such persons as have remained on it shall be disinfected in such manner as shall be laid down by the Port Health Officer. VII.-Any mails, baggage or cargo which may be brought by any vessel so arriving shall be landed under such pre- cautions as to the Health Officer may seem necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. VIII.-It will be the duty of the Port Officer to facilitate the conveyance to all persons in quarantine of such supplies of provisions, stores, and other articles as may be required. IX.-All vessels arriving at Bombay, which may have communi- cated with vessels coming from-shall be subjected to the same rules as vessels arriving at Bombay from No. 591 of 1897 Note by Surgeon-Major MacCartie on Government of India letter No. 1623, Home Department, dated 1st June 1897 (Sanitary). In order to bring the rules now in force at Bombay against the export and import of plague within the lines laid down by the Venice Sanitary Conference, two sets of rules must be considered:- I.-Those to be enforced as regards departures by sea. II.-Those against arrivals by sea. I.-Departures. 2. The two points of difference between the Bombay rules at present in force and the Venice Regulations are- (a) Venice rules insist on medical inspection on shore before embarkation of each person sailing on a vessel: whereas
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 341 the Bombay rules permit of inspection on shore or on boardship as the case may be. (b) Inspection on shore of contaminated or suspected articles is compulsory under the Venice rules and is not mentioned in the Bombay rules. A third point of difference is the wish of the Government of India expressed in paragraph 5 of their letter No. 1623 of 1st June, that the attendants and relatives of infected cases should be prevented from embarking. 3. The order to inspect on shore each person sailing on the ship would seem to include crews as well as passengers, and if that is the intention, its inclusion in the Bombay rules will be difficult, if not impossible, for the following reasons:- A very large number of vessels do not enter the docks. They load and unload in the stream and their crews therefore live on board, but communicate freely with the shore either by visits to the town or by contact with shore people who load or unload the vessels. If these crews have to be brought on shore for inspection, great expense, trouble, and delay will be thrown on shipowners with no compensating advantage, for, if any member of them is found at the inspection of shore to be suffering from plague, he must be considered to have already infected the ship he has come from. The largest P. and O. vessels always sail from the stream and have crews numbering from 300 to 340 men. All these have free communication with the city for many days before departure from Bombay. Are they to be brought on shore for examination on the day of sailing, as would seem to be intended by the rules of the Venice Conference, and if so, what sanitary object has been attained by a transfer from ship to shore at great expense, inconvenience and delay to the owners, and at considerable risk to the ships thus deprived of their crews ? The same objections apply though in a lesser degree to such vessels as sail direct from the wet docks. Although the question of expense may not arise, there is a maximum of inconvenience and no apparent compensating sanitary advantage. 5. How important is this crew question will be seen from the return of persons inspected prior to their departure from Bombay by sea during the months of April and May last, the only two months for which the returns have as yet been made out. In April 80,008 persons were inspected, of whom 42,141 were crews. In May 81,398, of whom 44,797 were crews. It is thus evident that the crews of vessels have been even more numerous than the passengers, and that the transfer of an average of
?342 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. over forty-three thousand a month to shore for inspection would have been impracticable, and as regards any sanitary object, such as the prevention of infection on a departing vessel, useless. 6. It is to be hoped then that the expression "every person sailing in the vessel must be examined on shore" which occurs in paragraph 5 of Government of India letter No. 1623 of 1st June 1897, will not be held to include the crews of vessels. 7. On the other hand, the inspection of all passengers on shore will be possible, although extremely difficult and very expensive as will be seen from the following remarks. In accordance with the Venice Regulations, Bombay, as long as indigenous cases of plague occur there, will be bound to inspect all outgoing persons; but it is the opinion of many medical men of standing that plague will, as cholera had done, become endemic in Bombay. There is therefore a possibility if not a probability of the Local Government having to provide an inspecting staff to prevent the export of plague cases, commensurate with the enormous human traffic between Bombay and other ports. To estimate what staff is necessary for this purpose is of course impossible until it is known whether the regulations as to inspection refer only to vessels bound for Europe, or are to apply as at present, to all persons leaving Bombay by sea for anywhere. If the latter, then a staff sufficient to inspect some 80,000 people a month will be necessary. Such a staff has been in existence since the 6th Feb- ruary, and consists of- 1 Port Health Officer, 1 Additional Port Health Officer, 3 Commissioned Medical Officers, 3 Assistant Surgeons, 1 Hospital Assistant, 2 Lady Doctors, and services of one other Lady Doctor on at least two days of each week, and in addition to the above, three qualified medical officers who worked under the supervision of the Customs Department, chiefly in connection with the inspection of small native sailing craft. The above staff was really too small, and the work was only satisfactorily done by working at a pressure which is only possible for a limited time, which left absolutely no margin for sickness or accident, and necessitated hours of duty lasting on too many occasions from 5-30 A.M. to 7 and at times 8 P.M. with a very brief interval for breakfast, whilst it was found necessary on English mail days to supplement that staff by enlisting the services of at least two and sometimes four of the Professors of the Grant Medical College.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 343 The necessity for a large staff is not merely because so large a number of persons have to be inspected, or because vessels sail at all hours and from different anchorages or berths in a large harbour, but also because plague is a disease which compels a most rigid inspection of all persons who present themselves for examination. Its main and chiefest signs are fever and bubos, and accordingly any man with fever or with bubos becomes an object of suspicion, has to have his temperature taken and be examined practically naked. During the inspection of departing passengers by sea in February, March, April and May, the numbers placed on one side for temper- ature observation ranged from 20 to 25 per cent., and as many as a dozen thermometers were in use at the same time. 8. Therefore as long as plague exists, the Local Government will require a very large staff to examine outgoing vessels, for, even if there are but few cases of plague in the city, every one departing from Bombay must be looked upon as a possible plague case, and will have to be most rigidly examined ; for no Port Health Officer can be expected to sign a bill-of-health which certifies to the absence of plague from amongst crew and passengers, unless he is satisfied that all that is humanly possible has been done to ensure that the bill-of-health is an honest one. 9. It becomes, then, important to consider how the inspection of outgoing persons from Bombay can be managed without the Local Government having to undergo a very heavy expenditure ; and, as I submit, the expense of an inspecting staff will, if all persons are to be examined on shore, as directed in paragraph 5 of Government of India letter No. 1623 of 1st June, be so great as to practically be prohibi- tive. 10. In discussing the question of shore inspection, the starting points of steamers must be remembered. Vessels sail from- (1) Berths alongside banders or docks harbour walls. (2) From the wet dock. (3) From the stream or open harbour. As regards class (1) there is no difficulty. The passengers of this class are even now examined on shore in sheds belonging to the Port Trust, and specially arranged for the purpose, and are then passed direct into their vessel, and these passengers are those most likely to be infected, being those who travel by Shepherd's steamers and the British India boats bound to Kathiawar, Cutch and Karachi. As regards classes (2) and (3), the difficulties and expense of inspection on shore at once become manifest, even if the passengers only are considered.
?344 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. They are- (a) Increased staff necessary. (b) Considerable outlay required to erect suitable buildings with separate compartments for the inspection of men and women, and retiring rooms for the more private examina- tion always necessary in plague inspections. (c) The difficulty of controlling the movements of passengers after inspection. (d) An increase of staff will be necessary more especially in the case of vessels sailing from the stream, because in addi- tion to the inspection of passengers on shore, the vessels and crews (if it is permitted to examine the latter on board) must also be inspected, and even if the crews are not to be inspected on board, the vessels must still be examined, and their sanitary condition enquired into. The importance of this sanitary examination of vessels cannot well be exaggerated, and has always been admit- ted here and given a prominent place in the Government bills-of-health. If passengers may be examined on board, then vessel, crew and passengers can all be examined in one place and by the same staff. It follows that more men and more time will be required if the ship has to be examined at one time and the passengers at another. (b) Outlay for erection of buildings. Two such buildings will be necessary, one for passengers embarking on vessels of class (2) placed at some central position of the wet docks and a second situated at, say, Ballard pier, for passengers em- barking in vessels of class (3). The necessity for these buildings disappears if passengers may be allowed to embark before inspection. (c) Difficulty of control of passengers after inspection. This is very apparent in connection with vessels leaving the wet docks and the stream. Vessels sail from the docks according to tidal conditions both by day and night, and some of them carry from five to six hundred native pas- sengers. Such a vessel may be timed to leave her berth at 4 A.M. Her passengers can be inspected on previous evening on shore. They have then to be escorted to their vessel, and, on boarding it find that all the ship's water closets are closed, as they are by rule. This compels to resort to the dock latrines. Who is to prevent them, when they have left their ship for this purpose, from visiting city ? After they have been inspected on shore, who is to guarantee
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 345 that those inspected are those who ultimately sail in the vessels ? Under a system which permits inspection on board the passengers would be embarked at sunset, the vessel would leave dock at 4 A.M. and anchor in the stream, where at 6 A.M., her passengers would be inspected, and the vessel sail away immediately the examination was over. The same difficulty, but more intensified, exists in the cases of vessels lying in the stream. Who is to control the passengers between Ballard pier and vessels lying all over the harbour and often several miles from Ballard pier ? This difficulty of control of passengers may be got over by a sufficiently large police force, and special barges on which to convey persons to the various ships, but native sepoys are sometimes ineffi- cient, and not always beyond the reach of bribery. 11. The difficulty and expense of compulsory shore inspection will of course be much lessened if the rules of the Venice Sanitary Conference are held to apply only to vessels leaving Bombay for European ports, but they will exist even then to a very appreciable extent. 12. It now remains to show that the system at present in force in Bombay, which permits of inspection on boardship or on shore as the conditions demand, has not been attended with any ill conse- quences and has, as regards the prevention of the export of plague to other countries, worked satisfactorily. Since 6th February, 1897, when the Government order for the inspection of all vessels leaving Bombay came into force, only one plague case as far as is known got away from Bombay by sea, viz., that by the S.S. Dilwara hired transport. Before that date two plague cases occurred in the pil- grim vessel Pekin after departure from Bombay. In both those cases passengers were inspected on shore prior to embarkation, and in the Dilwara instance had the inspection of passengers been made on board at the time when the Port Health staff visited the vessel for examination of the ship and its crew, the plague case which had been inspected two days previously on shore might possibly have been discovered. The arrangements for the medical examination of pas- sengers by troopships are made by the military authorities, the Port Health staff only inspecting crews and vessels. The Dilwara and Pekin were therefore infected vessels, and the latter vessel carried over 1,000 of perhaps the most insanitary and dirty people, who travel by sea, pilgrims-yet the disease did not catch on, nor did the passengers on board these very crowded vessels suffer in health from the fact that plague cases were amongst them. During the inspection on boardship from February up to date, many persons e 44
346 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. have been removed from outwardbound vessels as suspicious cases. Some of these developed plague after removal, but in no instance did the disease appear amongst those who remained on the vessels. They sailed away and no more plague occurred from which it would seem that the circumstances of a sea voyage are inimical to the plague microbe: and that people affected by manifest plague, or in whom the disease is incubating, may be on boardship without danger to the rest of the passengers, unless, indeed, the number of infected ones is very great. The compulsory inspection on shore then does not seem to be an absolute sanitary necessity, whilst it has been shown that it can only be carried out by a system which will neces- sitate a very large expenditure of time and money. 13. (B) Disinfection on shore of contaminated or suspected arti- cles. This can be carried out under the Bombay system. An infected case on board a vessel may be removed with all his baggage, as now is done to an observation camp, before leaving which kit can be and is now disinfected: and the vessel or parts of it where the case lay can be also dealt with. 14. The rules marked A (outward) drawn up in consultation with the Commissioner of Customs, and forwarded by him to Government, accordingly, are worded so as to permit of inspection on boardship as well as on shore, whilst in other respects they are adjusted to meet the requirements of paragraph 5 of Government of India letter No. 1623 of 1st June. They also provide for the segregation of actual plague and suspicious cases in plague hospitals and observation camps re- spectively and for disinfection of vessels and baggage. An opening has been left in rule I, so that it can be made appli- cable to all vessels leaving Bombay for anywhere or to vessels bound for certain ports only, e.g., Europe, Africa, etc. II. 15. The rules marked B (inward) have been drawn up according to the instructions laid down in paragraph 12 of Government of India letter No. 1623 of 1st June, 1897, and it is proposed that they should be applicable to vessels arriving at Bombay from any infected port, Indian or foreign. Under them certain places for quarantine camps outside the city will be required, and it should be noted that no such places at present exist which are suitable for the purpose: whilst the Plague Committee's segregation camps inside the city are temporary and will not provide accommodation for from 600 to 800 people, which must be considered insufficient when it is borne in mind that one pil- grim ship alone, the Pekin, may arrive from an infected port such as Jeddah with more than 1,000 passengers.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 347 No. 3070, dated Bombay, the 2nd July 1897. From-SIR JAMES MACNABB CAMPBELL, K.C.I.E., I.C.S., Acting Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Abkari, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. In continuation of my letter No. 2915 of 24th June 1897, I have the honour to forward copy of the Collector Mr. Kennedy's views and the remarks which, after consulting the Health Officer of the port, I would offer in support of our original constructions. 2. I see no need for drawing up rules for the definition of the differ- Collector's paragraph 4. ent classes of vessels suggested by Mr. Kennedy in his paragraph 4. As sug- gested in my paragraph 4, it seems to me the better course to leave it to Government, in accordance with changing conditions, from time to time, to decide to what vessels and port the rules shall apply. 3. In this paragraph, Mr. Kennedy assumes that the crew are not Collector's paragraph 5. to be examined on shore. He con- siders that the rule should be drawn up on the assumption that the Venice Convention sanctions the board- ship inspection of crews. I agree with the Health Officer of the port in doubting whether the framers of the Convention rules intended to have the crew examination on boardship. Our reasons are - (a) The use of the expression " cumpulsory medical inspection Convention, Chapter I, of each person sailing on the Rule I, Notification II,  page 3- ship. (b) The use of the phrase, in paragraph 5 of the Government of India's letter under reply, "All passengers and crew are on board " implying that the crew have been out of the ship, presumably for inspection, and further implying that the Government of India's definition of person sailing in a ship includes both crew and passengers. (c) If the details laid down in the Convention rules for the inspection of passengers do not apply also to crews, then the rules contain no provision for the inspection of that most important section of those who sail in ships, who, I agree with the Health Officer of the port, are more likely to be infected than passengers for Europe. The question of the relative danger from passengers and from crew is treated at length in paragraph 12 below. Collector's paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 Under Filgrimships, paragraph I, Chapter I, page 3. 2. The Collector holds that, as the Convention rules enjoin shore inspection, this procedure must at all risk and cost be adopted. I venture to think that the exemption granted, in
348 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. the case of Batavia, shows that if satisfied of the necessity or of the advantage of any local system, the Convention are ready to modify their requirements. I also venture to think that the Health Officer of the port has shown that apart from the serious difficulties, the existing mixed board and shore inspection is on sanitary grounds better than the proposed rule forbidding any inspection except on shore. Collector's paragraph 9. 5. In reply to the Collector's objection that, if the local system is introduced, other countries may raise difficulties on the ground that shore inspection has not been carried out in Bombay, I would remark that the Government of India can protect themselves by informing the signatories to the Convention beforehand of the proposed alterations and giving reasons for their adoption. Collector's paragraph 10. 6. The Collector sees no impossibility in shore inspection. I venture to think that if crews are not exempted shore inspection will be impossible. And further that shore inspection of passengers, though possible, will be very difficult and very costly. Collector's paragraph 11. 7. The Collector notices that in Bombay shore inspection already exists in the case of pilgrim ships. In paragraph 10 of my letter I have explained that in Bombay the shore inspection of pilgrims is carried out under restrictions which could not be enforced in the case of regular passenger ships. I would further point out that the average yearly number of pilgrim ships leaving Bombay is 20; and that, com- paratively insignificant as that number is, the inconvenience caused to the ordinary traffic of the dock by the special procedure connected with the departure of pilgrim ships is very marked. Collector's paragraphs 12 and 13. 8. The Collector selects the case of a Peninsular and Oriental mail steamer. In doing so he selects the class in which difficulties are least though still noticeable. As passengers can hardly be prevented from going on board at any time, it follows that to secure inspection on shore medical attendance must be available throughout the day at one particular place, while for the departures by all other boats, including those from the docks and bandars, additional medical attendance must be provided at other places. Moreover, the Collector ignores any con- Health Officer of Port, note 591, paragraph 10 (c), my letter, para- giaph 7. sideration oi tne difficulties pointed out both by the Health Officer of the port and by myself in regard to the departures of vessels from the wet docks with large numbers of native passengers.
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 349 9. The Collector considers that the rules he has formulated (para- Collector's paragraph 14. graph 13) for Peninsular and Oriental departures can be adopted by other passenger steamers to Europe, China and Japan.. On this point I have obtained the following note from the Health Officer of the port:- "It is not clear why the Collector selects China and Japan as countries to which the Venice rules should apply; or why he omits Africa which, judging by the numerous telegrams from the Govern- ment of India directing a most careful examination of all persons sailing for its ports, must be considered of sufficient importance to warrant its inclusion in the list of countries entitled to protection under the Convention rules. Nor is it evident on what grounds he omits Mauritius which can truly be described as the most quarantining place in the world. China, which the Collector in- cludes, is the natural home of plague and its Emperor has not signed the Venice Convention; while Africa is now largely under the British Government and thus comes indirectly, if not directly, within the scope of the Convention." 10. The Collector holds that the Local Government can supply its Collector's paragraph 15. own rules in the case of vessels for any Indian or British port irrespec- tive of the rules of the Venice Convention. Still it is to be remem- bered that under a recent order of the Government of India letter No. 1623, dated 1st June 1897, the Local Government rules regard- ing the inspection of ships are to be adjusted to the Convention rules. 11. With reference to the Collector's opinion that two small exa- Collector's paragraph 16. mination rooms on the Ballard pier and in the docks would suffice for inspection, the experience of the Health Officer of the port detailed in paragraph 7 of his note shows that, owing to the peculiar nature of the signs of plague, a somewhat elaborate arrangement for private examination is necessary. 12. The Collector does not think much danger of infection need Collector's paragraph 17. be apprehended from the crew. As his view is opposed to that held by me and by the Health Officer of the port, I quote from a minute by Dr. MacCartie- "The Commissioner's letter No. 2916, paragraph 7, points out that, in the case of vessels bound for the places mentioned by Mr. Ken- nedy, namely, Europe, China and Japan, the danger from the crew is much greater than from the passengers. That the Commissioner's
?350 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. view is correct can easily be shown. Every Peninsular and Oriental Company's liner during the height of the plague on arrival in Bombay was, under the law and practice of the port, forced to discharge its native crew: by law the crew can and do claim their discharge. Three or four days, sometimes one day, before a vessel's departure another crew has been signed on the articles. This fresh crew has come from the slums of plague stricken Bombay, whilst the pas- sengers who are almost all Europeans have come from up-country stations and boarded their vessels direct from the train. Even in the case of local passengers they have come from ports of Bombay comparatively free from plague. The natural result has been that during the height of the epidemic no passenger, except two postal officials, both natives, was removed on suspicion from any vessel. Whilst it was found necessary, in almost every instance to remove several of the native crew. The information Mr. Kennedy asks for as regards instances of vessels becoming infected through their crews has already been practically furnished in paragraph 12 of my note 591. This is the return on which the argument was based that as plague cases have been removed from vessels without infecting the rest of their passengers and crews, the Bombay rules which permit a person to board his vessel before inspection, whilst much more workable and cheaper, are no less efficient for the pre- vention of the export of plague than the Venice Convention Rules." 13. As regards the Collector's view that the master of the vessel Collector's paragraph 18. should be made responsible for the carrying out of plague rules by passengers, the Health Officer of the port holds that no such respon- sibility can be enforced. The following remarks seem to me to carry weight:- " Ship commanders have stated to me over and over again that they cannot exercise complete control even over their crews, much less over their passengers. During the plague time when com- manders have been asked to prevent their crews going on shore even from the stream, they have stated they were powerless to prevent them." Dr. MacCartie continues: "Even if Government considers that a responsibility thrown on the commander and a few simple directions to the dock gate-keeper, as suggested by Mr. Kennedy be sufficient to ensure that the passenger inspected in the dock at say 5 P.M. is the same who sails in the vessel at 4 A.M., and that that passenger has had no communication with Bombay after boarding his vessel, I, as Port Health Officer, for the following reasons, refuse to consider that these simple checks are sufficient. Should any case of plague appear on a vessel after leaving this port upon whom will
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 351 the odium fall if not on the officer who signed the bill-of-health ? The bill-of-health certifies to the health of all on board and no man can be asked to sign it unless he is certain that it is a true bill? And that all those inspected on shore have had no communication with shore after bearding their vessel and are those who were inspected by his staff. He could not possibly accept the ineffective and simple checks described as sufficient in paragraph 18 of Mr. Kennedy's letter." 14. The Collector seems to contemplate the disinfecting of Collector's paragraph 19. pilgrims' baggage leaving Bombay. The reason why there is no special notice of disinfecting outward baggage is that provision is made for the treatment of the baggage of all infected passengers. The rules do not, it seems to me, contemplate any interference with baggage, except with baggage belonging to an infected passenger. In the second part of this paragraph (paragraph 20) the Collector expects that inspection work will not be permanently increased, because a few isolated or imported cases will not be held to make the port infected; but section II, Chapter II of the Convention lays down that one indigenous case officially reported sets agoing the whole machinery of the Convention rules. As has been noticed in my former letter to Government unless the concession of part shore part ship inspection is secured, this machinery includes the inspection of the ship and crew in one place and of the passengers in another place. 15. I trust that these further explanations may make more clear to Government the necessity of obtaining from the Convention the concession of an alternative inspection either on shore or on ship board. No. 11521-C., dated Bombay, the 28th June 1897. From-R. M. KENNEDY, Esq., Collector of Land Revenue, Customs and Opium, To-The Commissioner of Customs, Salt, Opium and Abkari, Bombay. I have the honour to report with reference to your No. 2917, dated 25th instant. 2. I have no sufficient experience to offer comments on the rules accompanying your letter. 3. However, there are a few points to which I should wish to draw attention and a few supplementary points on which I may offer comment. 4. In the first place it does not seem to me clear to what outward- bound vessels the Venice Convention rules should apply whether (a) to all vessels leaving Bombay during epidemic as the wording "for
?352 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. the prevention of the spread of the plague " seems to imply, (b) or to vessels for ports of foreign powers who are signatories to the Con- vention, (c) or to vessels for any foreign port, (d) or for vessels leav- ing for Europe only. I venture to think this requires definition before any rules can be finally accepted. 5. Secondly, I do not understand whether the rules of the Venice Convention for medical examination of outward bound ships include the case of the crew of the vessel or that of the passengers only. As the crew of a vessel is already embarked and covered by a bill of health, and the Convention rules are intended to prevent a vessel becoming infected by embarkation, I am inclined to suppose that the medical examination on shore refers to passengers only. Obviously if the crew is infected, the ship is an infected ship, the object of the rules seems to be to prevent a ship becoming infected, so then the special medical examination on shore cannot affect the crew, but those intending to embark, i.e., the passengers. 6. You have proved conclusively the adequacy of the present regulations in Bombay to prevent infected ships leaving the harbour, and the difficulties attending any change in present methods. 7. The weakness, however, in the present system appears to be that it is not the method approved by the Venice Convention which enjoins (and especially enjoins) medical examination on shore; and the principles of the Venice Convention rules have been accepted by the Government of India. 8. It seems to me that we are bound to carry out the rules which have been accepted by superior authority. 9. Moreover, there seems a danger that at any moment in the case of an outbreak of plague, it may be alleged by any country disposed to raise difficulties that the measures now taken in Bombay are inadequate and contrary to the express intention of the Conven- tion rules. 10. It does not seem to me impossible to secure medical inspec- tion on shore. 11. This is already done in the case of pilgrims. 12. It appears to me that it could be done in the case of vessels carrying passengers to Europe and to China and Japan. 13. I will take the case of the P. and O. Mail Steamers. It seems to me that passengers could be examined at little extra cost at the Ballard pier, and then embarked by launch on to the steamer. A few precautions would be necessary- (a) The production by passengers of their tickets, which should be stamped after the passengers had been medically ex- amined,
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 353 (b) The issuing of steam launch tickets to friends seeing passengers off. Such friends should also be examined, and a small fee might be charged if this were held ad- visable. (c)  The rigorous examination   of all without tickets   from  the steamer. (d)  The  rigorous  exclusion   from  the steamer  of  all   who  do not come by the Company's launch from the Ballard pier. I would point out that such regulations would not only comply with the Venice Convention rules, but would also further order on the P. and O. Mail Steamer, and would prevent the danger which at present exists from the crowding of the steamer with all sorts and conditions of men (native servants and the like) for whose health there is no guarantee, and who, however, may introduce plague and render the steamer infected. Under regulations, such as are suggested, only those interested in passengers em- barking would be likely to obtain admission on the ship. 14.  Similar rules could be adopted for other  passenger  steamers for Europe, China, and Japan. 15.  I believe there is already  efficient examination   on   shore of coasting steamers.    But I do not understand that the Venice Conven- tion rules are intended to apply to vessels between British ports only, either in India, or between India and any other British port  outside India.    Rules for such ships in time of plague would be  made by the British Government irrespective of the Venice Convention rules. 16.  For shore examination of passengers it   would  be   necessary to supply two small examination rooms on the Ballard   pier and  also in the docks.    The cost of such rooms need not be excessive. 17.  As I have already stated, I do not understand that the Venice Convention rules are intended to apply to the crews of vessels as (a) their examination on shore is impossible and (b) useless, as   it  could not prevent a vessel being an infected vessel by the discovery of any member of the crew being infected, as  he would have come from the ship, and would  therefore have   made   the ship infected   before  he came on shore for examination.    Moreover, I   do  not think  there  is much danger to be apprehended from   the   crews,   and  it  would   be interesting to know if, during the recent  plague epidemic, Surgeon- Major MacCartie has found any  case  in which a  ship  has   become infected from illness among the crew. 18. In the case of the crews (and passengers) I think responsibi- lity after medical examination should be thrown directly on the master of the ship, who should see that no one leaves the ship for any length of time, and in case any one does, that person should be precluded from returning to the ship. In the stream this could be c 45
?354 Measures to prevent the [ APP. IX. easily arranged, and in the docks the master could be materially assisted after dusk (when there would be most danger of such an occurrence) by a few simple instructions to the dock gate-keeper. 19.  In the proposed rules for Bombay nothing seems stated as to the disinfecting of baggage  of outgoing steamers.    In the   case   of passengers for Europe, I do not think  any   disinfecting  of the   bag- gage of passengers who are themselves free from infection would   be necessary.    In the case of pilgrims it would seem advisable in times of epidemic to pass baggage through a disinfecting chamber. 20.  Apparently it lies with   the Bombay  Government to   declare when the port is infected.    I trust the plague will not be   endemic in Bombay; the decreasing mortality from plague (now almost at   zero) does not indicate this.   I presume, after it has once gone, the occasion hereafter of a few isolated and imported  cases   will   not   be   held   to render the port infected.    The inspection work will not therefore be permanently increased, though it appears from Surgeon-Major Mac- Cartie's report that medical staff may require some increase.    No. 90. No. 1904, dated Simla, the 6th August 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of  India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, General Department. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 4021, dated the 22nd July, on the subject of the contemplated alteration of the rules issued by the Government of Bombay under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Act I of 1870, so as to bring them into accord with the provisions of the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897. I am at the same time to forward, for the information of the Government of Bombay, a copy of correspondence with the Government of Bengal on the modification of the rules issued by that Government for the port of Calcutta. 2.  The   draft  rules  prepared  by  the   Acting   Commissioner   of Customs, Salt, Opium, and Abkari, with the assistance of the   Health Officer of the Port, which are forwarded with your letter, deal with the inspection of outward and inward bound vessels and are drawn up for the port of Bombay. 3.  The most important point in connection with the rules   for  the inspection  of  outward   bound   vessels is the fact that these rules do not provide that the medical examination of each person sailing   shall be made on shore.    The advisers of the Government of Bombay point out that there are very grave obstacles to the examination   on  shore of all persons sailing, and the   Governor in Council accepting this view asks that the convention may be  so  modified  as  to allow of
?APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 355 inspection on shore or on board, as the circumstances of any parti- cular port may render necessary. After a careful consideration of the subject, the Government of India are constrained to accept the opinion of the Government of Bombay and their advisers, and to authorize the continuance of the practice at present adopted at the port of Bombay, under which the examination is made on board or on shore as may be convenient. In arriving at this conclusion the Governor General in Council has been specially influenced by the following considerations. Section II of Chapter I of the Venice Con- vention, relating to sanitary measures for ships sailing from infected ports, is divided into two portions - the first relating to ordinary vessels and the second relating to pilgrim ships. In the case of the latter the direction to examine on shore is followed by a remark that in carrying out this measure each Government may take local con- siderations and conditions into account, and a footnote explains that the Conference decided that in the Dutch Indies the inspection may be carried out on board ship. The Government of India agree with Sir James Campbell that, if the concession of examination on board can be made in regard to the most dangerous class of passengers, namely, pilgrims, it ought also to be made in the case of other persons should circumstances render this desirable. And it is shown that the circumstances of the port of Bombay render the concession impera- tive. It is pointed out that the most important portion of the examina- tion is the examination of the crew, firstly because of the persons examined the greater number belong to crews of vessels, and secondly because experience has shown that the crews are much more likely to be infected than the passengers. It is further shown that in the case of the crews it is practically impossible to examine them all on shore, and that in the less important case of the passengers, though it is possible, it would give rise to very serious inconvenience both to the passengers and to the regular working of the port arrange- ments. Lastly, the Government of India attach particular importance to the great success that has attended the examination under the arrangements hitherto prescribed by the Government of Bombay, and they consider that this success is the strongest argument that can be urged for the continuance of those arrangements. I am to take this opportunity to state that the Governor General in Council fully shares in the appreciation of the admirable work done by Dr. MacCartie and his staff during the past six months, which is expressed by the Govern- ment of Bombay. 4. If, however, inspection on board is permitted, it will be necessary to modify the portion of Rule II of the draft rules for outward bound vessels which deals with the discovery of a case of plague during the
356 Measures to prevent the                    [ APP. IX. examination. As Rule II stands at present it permits the grant of a clean bill-of-health, even though a case of plague is discovered on board, provided that the patient is removed and that the other pre- scribed precautions are duly carried out. Rule I of the existing rules for the treatment of vessels leaving the port of Bombay, which are contained in the Resolution of the Government of Bombay, No. 656 165/P., dated the 6th February, prohibits the departure of the vessel until she   has  obtained   a  clean  bill-of-health,   and permits the grant of a clean bill-of-health if the persons left on board are free   from   plague. Neither draft Rule II nor existing Rule I conforms to the requirements of the Venice Convention.   On the one hand, if the measures prescribed by the Convention are duly carried out, the vessel may be   allowed  to depart, even though she cannot be certified to be healthy; on the other hand, if a case of plague is discovered   on   board,   the   fact   must  be stated in  the bill-of-health.    Chapter II, Section VIII of the Conven- tion lays down the rule that a ship sailing from an infected   port   may only  be   considered  as   healthy   if no case of plague has occurred on board either before departure, during the voyage, or on   arrival.    The adoption   of   the   prescribed   precautions on the occurrence of a case before departure cannot alter the fact that the vessel is infected.    It is stated by Dr. MacCartie that during the height of the epidemic it was generally  found  necessary  to remove some of the crew on suspicion, and that in some instances the suspected cases turned out to be   true cases   of   plague.    It   does   not  appear necessary to mention in the bill-of-health the removal of a case on mere   suspicion,   for   instance, the  removal  of a   person suffering from fever without any other sign of plague.    But if at the time of inspection on board a   case is disco- vered, which is ascertained or believed to be plague, then it is clearly necessary to mention the fact in the bill-of-health.    In   such cases the precautions   adopted  should also be   stated, including, if the patient has been living on board, the disinfection of the infected part  of  the vessel. 5. Apart from the matter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the draft rules for the inspection of outward bound vessels appear to the Government of India to be generally suitable and in accordance with the Venice Convention, and they consider that the rules may be sanctioned subject to the following remarks. It should be stated in Rule I, in accordance with the terms of the Convention, that the Health Officer must examine each person sailing on the ship, and that the Consular Authority interested in the ship may be present at the examination. In the case of vessels touching at the port of Bombay for the purpose of embarking passengers, for which provision is made in Rule I, the inspection should, in the opinion of the Government of
APP. IX. ]                spread of infection by sea. 357 India, be made on shore, and they consider that this should be stated in the rule. It also appears from Sir James Campbell's letter of the 24th June that under present arrangements passengers are sometimes examined on shore. The rules should provide that in such cases persons suffering, or suspected to be suffering from plague, and their relatives and attendants, should not be permitted to embark. 6.  Rule I commences with the words "no vessel shall   leave  the port of Bombay for any of the following ports."    A blank is then  left for the  insertion of ports.    In paragraph 7 of your letter under reply, it is stated that the   Government  of   Bombay agree with Sir  James Campbell   that, when plague cases have become very few in Bombay, the inspection rules should be applied to certain classes of vessels only. They consider  that   so   long as   Bombay   remains   an infected port within the meaning of  that  expression   as   used   in   the Convention, individual   medical  inspection   must be made of every person sailing in each vessel proceeding to any part of a country which is a party  to the Convention; but that, as regards vessels proceeding to other ports, whether within  or outside   India,  the   inspection   can   be   altered or discontinued at will.    The Governor in Council hopes that the time is   near when the inspection of vessels proceeding from Bombay may in some cases be relaxed   or discontinued,   and   enquiry is made   in your letter  whether   such   alterations   or discontinuance   should be made without previous reference to the Government  of   India.    I am to   say  that the   Governor   General in Council considers that for the present the rules must be maintained in their entirety in  the  case of vessels sailing to all ports whether in or out of India.    In view of  the great   increase   in  the mortality in Bombay and of the recrudescence of plague in some   of  the   surrounding   districts,   His  Excellency   in Council is of opinion that it   would  be   unwise   to relax   any   of   the precautions at the present  time.    His Excellency in Council is also not at present convinced that the rules for vessels   bound   for   Indian ports may be   ultimately   discontinued  or   relaxed   before   those  for vessels sailing for ports out of India.    The Government of India would therefore prefer that a reference should be made to   them   before the rules   are   discontinued or relaxed with reference to vessels sailing to any particular class of ports. 7.  I am to observe that the inspection   rules   for   outward   bound vessels forwarded   with   your   letter   are   framed only for the port of Bombay,   and that no mention is made in your letter or its enclosures of any other port in the Bombay Presidency.    As Karachi is still   an infected   port within the meaning of the Convention, the Government of India presume that vessels sailing from that port will be treated   in the same way as vessels sailing from Bombay, and that the Government
?358 Measures to prevent the                   [ APP. IX. of Bombay  will,   after   considering  the   circumstances  of the  port, decide whether inspection should be made on board or on shore. 8. The Government of India consider that the draft rules for the inspection of vessels arriving at the port of Bombay, appended to Sir James Campbell's letter of the 24th June, are generally suitable and in accordance with the Venice Convention, but that they require modifi- cation in the following respects:- (1) In Rule III the Health Officer is given discretion, in the case of a healthy ship which has not completed ten days from the date of departure from an infected port, to (a) refuse pratique until the end of the ten days' period, or (b) until all persons on board have been subjected to medical supervision up to ten days from the date of departure. It is understood that alternative (a) contemplates the detention of all persons on board ship. The Government of India consider that this alternative is open to objection, and that, as is stated in paragraph 12 of my letter No. 1623, dated the 1st June, the passengers should be disembarked and kept under observation on shore. In this connection I am to invite attention to the conveneint provision in Rule VIII (8) of the draft quarantine rules appended to the letter of the Bengal Government of the 17th July for the surveillance at their destination of healthy passengers on their giving and undertaking to submit themselves to surveillance by a medical officer. (2)  In the last sentence of Rule IV the period of quarantine should be definitely fixed by the substitution of the word "should" for the word "may." (3)   In Rule VI it should   not  be  left to   the   discretion   of the Health Officer to allow the healthy passengers and crew of an infected vessel to land for the purpose of being kept under observation. As is stated in paragraph 11 of my letter of the 1st June, it should be obligatory to land the healthy and keep them under observation on shore. An exception to this rule should only be made in the case of those members of the crew whom it is necessary to detain on board for the care of the vessel. (4)  It appears to the Government of India that the   form of  the draft quarantine rules appended to the letter of the Govern- ment of Bengal of the 17th July is in some respects preferable to the form of the draft rules appended to Sir James Campbell's letter. In especial the Bengal rules are directed to meet the case of all infected and suspected

I am to suggest that the form of the draft rules forwarded with your letter might be re-modelled on the lines of the draft rules for the port of Calcutta. 9. In your letter and its enclosures no mention is made of the quarantine rules enforced at ports in the Bombay Presidency other than the port of Bombay. The rules now in force at Karachi, which were issued under Act I of 1870 in the notification of the Govern- ment of Bombay, No. 592, dated the 3rd February, and the rules now in force at other ports on the Bombay Coast, which were issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, in the notification of the Government of Bombay, No. 1211/710-P.,  dated the 6th March, are not in all respects in accordance with the Venice Convention. I am to suggest that the rules for Karachi and for the other ports on the Bombay Coast, where the Government of Bombay consider it necessary to still maintain an inspection of the inward sea traffic, should be modified in the same way as the rules for the port of Bombay. If the present rules for Karachi, which issued under Act I of 1870, are superseded by new rules framed under the Epidemic Diseases Act, it will be necessary to cancel the existing rules by a notification under Act I of 1870. *  Notification of   the  Government of Bombay, No. 583, dated the 3rd February 1897. 10. The case of the Aden quarantine rules requires special notice. With effect from the 5th October and the 13th October, respectively, the Government of Bombay published, under Act I of 1870, quarantine rules against Bombay and Karachi for the ports of Aden, Perim, and the Somali Coast. These rules were the usual quarantine rules based on the model B Quarantine Rules framed by the Government of India in 1888. They are still in force, but certain alterations, have been made   in   them,   of   which  the most important is the imposition * of ten days' quarantine from the date of the departure of the vessel on persons landing at Aden. It was also decided in the correspondence ending with your telegram of the 30th April that the Health Officer must not visit the vessel until the ten days' period expires, and that vessels merely using Aden as a port of call need not be examined at that port. In my telegram No. 1007, dated the 18th March, it was requested that revised rules giving effect to these decisions might be drawn up, and in your reply of the 30th April it was stated that the Resident at Aden had submitted proposed rules which required some revision. The Government of India have not yet received these revised rules,
?360 Measures to prevent the                [ APP. IX. The rules at present in force at Aden are in several respects opposed to the Venice Convention and the instructions contained in my letter of the 1st June. Rule IV prescribes fifteen days' quarantine for infected vessels. There is no provision in the rules for landing the sick and keeping them in an isolation hospital. The healthy are only landed and kept in segregation at the discretion of the Health Officer. The rules thus permit the detention of the sick and healthy together on board ship, a procedure which, in the opinion of the Government of India, is open to grave objection. There is also no provision in the rules for the disinfection or destruction of contaminated articles and for the disinfection of the ship. The Government of India recognize that in the case of Aden the imposition of quarantine rules is complicated by the importance of keeping the port clean in the eyes of the world. But if proper arrangements are made and proper precautions taken, the enforcement of the regulations pre- scribed by the Venice Convention will not, in the opinion of the Govern- ment of India, injure the reputation of the port. I am to say that the Governor General in Council will be glad if the Government of Bombay will, bearing these matters in mind, consider the measures to be taken for the treatment at Aden in accordance with the Venice Convention, of vessels from infected ports, in such a manner that the health of the port may not be injured nor its reputation endan- gered.

With reference to the remark of the Resident that the Port Sur- geon cannot   proceed   on  board a  vessel   in   quarantine   " without compromising himself," I am to observe that though this consideration was   of  some   importance   so long as   Egypt  or   European   nations were at liberty to impose quarantine against Aden without  assigning definite  reasons  for   their   action,   yet now   it   ceases to   have any weight, as, in   accordance with the principles of the Venice Conven- tion,   Aden can only be treated as an infected port if plague actually exists there.    It would in  the   opinion   of  this Government   be   out of the question to consider a scheme for  maintaining   a   floating hos- pital   with a   medical   officer   perpetually in   quarantine  so  long as plague existed at any port wherefrom vessels might arrive at Aden. 3.  His Excellency the Governor in    Council   is   inclined  to agree with  the Resident at Aden that, with the existing medical staff, it is impossible to   arrange for  the proper   medical inspection  of a ship, except by day light. 4.  With reference to the want  of  a   disinfecting  stove at  Aden I am to state   that the   Surgeon-General is being   consulted   on   the subject, and, if necessary, a  further  reference regarding it   will   be made to the Government of India. 5.  The Resident proposes that, as vessels cannot   be   admitted to pratique during the night time, the usual   form of  report  should   be sent on board of onward bound vessels to be   filled   in   by the   com- mander or medical off cer.    To this there seems to   the  Governor in Council to be no objection. ACCOMPANIMENTS TO THE LETTER TO THE GOVERNMENT OF  INDIA, NO. 5380, DATED 4TH OCTOBER 1897. Rules  applicable to  vessels arriving  at Aden from Ports   infected with Plague. Rule I.-The commander of every vessel, including buggalows or other native craft, arriving at Aden from an infected port shall, be- fore entering the harbour, hoist a yellow flag (or, if entering the port at night-time, exhibit two red lights one above the other at the main) and indicate by signal the port from which such vessel has come, and shall keep such flag and signals flying until permitted to take them down. The pilot on going alongside a vessel from an infected port shall direct the flag prescribed above to be hoisted if it has not been already done. Rule II.-Such commander shall not, except as hereinafter provid- ed, allow any communication, except orally, with the shore or with c 46
?362 Measures to prevent the                  [ APP. IX. any other vessel or boat, except the pilot boat, with which communica- tion shall be limited to receiving the pilot who shall proceed straight to the bridge. Rule III.-No vessel shall be given pratique until ten days from the date of its departure from an infected port. A vessel which carries no qualified medical officer shall not be given pratique until ten days from the date of its arrival in- Aden. Until the ten days' period has expired, a vessel shall, during its stay at Aden, remain at the quarantine anchorage appointed from time to time by the Resident by general or special order in this behalf. Until a vessel has been given pratique, it shall have no communication with the shore. Rule IV.-On the arrival of a vessel, whose destination is Aden, an officer appointed for the purpose by the Resident shall go alongside and ascertain whether ten days have or have not expired since its departure from an infected port. (a)   If ten days have expired since its departure from an   infected port, and if it carries a qualified medical officer, the officer appointed for   the   purpose   shall board the vessel and make such inquiries and inspection as   he thinks necessary, and may  require a declaration on oath from the medical officer of the vessel or the captain, or both, as to the existence of plague or   suspected plague on   board   the   vessel either   during  the  voyage  or   before   its  departure.    He shall then declare whether the vessel is "healthy," "suspected" or "infected," as   defined in Rule VII.   If he is satisfied that the vessel is "healthy" it shall be given pratique forthwith.    If he declares it to be "suspect- ed" or "infected,"   it shall be dealt with in   the   manner  prescribed in Rule VII. (b)  If on   the   arrival of a  vessel it   is ascertained that ten days have   not expired   since   its   departure from an infected port, or if it carries no qualified medical officer, it shall be detained at the quaran- tine anchorage until, in the former case, ten days have expired  since its departure from an infected port, or, in   the   latter  case,   ten   days have    expired   since   its  arrival   at   Aden,   after   which   the  officer appointed for the purpose shall take the measures specified   in   clause (a) of this rule, and classify the vessel: Provided, however, that the officer appointed for the purpose may, at any time before the expiration of the aforesaid period of ten days make such inquiries and inspections as he thinks necessary; and if, as the result thereof, he comes to the conclusion that the vessel is "infected," he shall forthwith, and without waiting for the expiration of the ten days' period, order it to be treated as infected.
?APP. IX. ]                 spread of infection by sea. 363 Rule V.-On the arrival of a vessel, which is onward bound, and which uses Aden as merely a port of call, the officer appointed for the purpose by the Resident shall go alongside and ascertain whether ten days have or have not expired since its departure from an infected port. (a) If ten days have expired since its departure from an infected port, and if it carries a qualified medical officer, and if the officer appointed for the purpose is permitted to make such inspection as he thinks necessary, and, as the result thereof and as the result of any inquiries he may make, is satisfied that the vessel is " healthy, " the vessel shall be given pratique. Otherwise it shall remain in quarantine at the anchorage appointed for the purpose by the Resident during its stay in port: no persons shall be landed therefrom, except at the quarantine camps appointed by the Resident, and no communication with the shore or with other vessels shall be allowed, except the landing of mails in quarantine and the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in quarantine. (b) If ten days have not expired since its departure from an in- fected port, or if it carries no qualified medical officer, it shall remain in quarantine at the quarantine anchorage appointed for the purpose during its stay in port, N.B.-No inspection of a vessel under Rules IV and V shall ordinarily be made, except by day-light. Rule VI.-These rules shall not prevent the transhipment, in quarantine, of passengers or other persons or mails or cargo from a vessel in quarantine to another; provided that thereafter the latter vessel shall be in quarantine. Rule VII.-For the purposes of these rules a "healthy" vessel means- "A vessel which has had no case of plague on board and which has left an infected port ten days or more previously." A " suspected " vessel means- " Any vessel, on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure or during the voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for twelve days." An " infected " vessel means- "Any vessel with plague on board, or on board which one or more cases have taken place within twelve days." The only measures which the authorities of the port of arrival may enforce with regard to " healthy " vessels are those which are pre- scribed for " suspected " vessels (medical inspection, disinfection, pumping out the bilge-water and the substitution of good drinking water for the water on board), except that the measures prescribed
?364                             Measures to prevent the                [ APP. IX. for the disinfection of the vessel itself may not be enforced in the case of healthy vessels. The following treatment is prescribed for " suspected " and "infected" vessels, respectively:- Suspected vessels are subject to the following measures which will be carried out under the orders and supervision of the officer appointed for the purpose:- 1.  Medical inspection. 2.  Disinfection; the soiled linen  and personal  effects of  the crew  and pas- sengers, which   in the  opinion  of the officer appointed for the purpose may be regarded as contaminated, should be disinfected. 3.  Pumping   cut the bilge-water after disinfection, and the substitution of good drinking water for the water stored on board. 4.  Disinfection of all  parts of   the   vessel   which have been inhabited by plague patients, and any other measures of disinfection that  may be ordered by the officer appointed for the purpose. A watch should be kept over the health of the crew and passengers for ten days from the date of arrival of the vessel; and the crew should not without the special permission of the officer appointed for the purpose be allowed to land, except on duty. Infected vessels are subject to the following rules:- 1.  The sick will be immediately disembarked and isolated. 2. The other persons on board should also, if possible, be disembarked and kept under observation or surveillance*   for a period varying according to the sanitary condition of the vessel and the date of the last case, but which must not exceed ten days. 3.  The soiled linen and personal effects of the crew and passengers, which in the opinion of the sanitary authority  of the port may be  considered as   infected will be disinfected. 4. The bilge-water will be pumped out after disinfection, and good drinking water will be substituted for the water stored on board. 5.  All parts of the vessel which have been inhabited by plague  patients should be disinfected, and such other measures of disinfection   shall be taken as may be ordered by the officer appointed for the purpose. Rule VIII.-The Resident shall have full power, subject to any orders that may be issued by the Government of Bombay, to make re- gulations or pass orders regarding the administration of quarantine camps and hospitals, whether ashore or afloat, and regarding quarantine anchorages, and all persons concerned shall be bound to obey such regulations and orders. Any vessel objecting to submit thereto, or to any of the measures indicated in these rules, shall, how- ever, be free to put back to sea. Rule IX.-Any mails or cargo which may be brought by any vessel arriving from an infected port shall be landed under such * The expression 'observation' means segregation of the passengers, either on board a vessel or in a lazaretto, till they have obtained free pratique. The expression 'sur- veillance' means that the passengers will not be isolated; they will at once obtain free pratique, but on arriving at their destination they will be kept under medical surveillance.

Rule X.-It will be the duty of the port officer to facilitate the conveyance to all vessels in quarantine of such supplies of provisions, stores and other articles as may be required by those on board. Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessels in quarantine to be subsequently removed by members of their crews. Rule XI.-All vessels arriving at Aden, which may have commu- nicated with vessels coming from an infected port, shall be subjected to the same rules as vessels arriving at Aden from an infected port. Rule XII.-All vessels which have undergone medical inspection and quarantine in the manner above prescribed should have the fact clearly stated on their bills of health. Extracts from the letter from the Political Resident, Aden, referred to in paragraph 1 of the letter to the Government of India. Rule IV, paragraph 2. The view hitherto held at Aden is that the Port Surgeon cannot proceed on board a ship in quarantine without compromising himself. If this view is correct-and by " inspection " in this paragraph personal inspection on board is meant-it would follow that the Port Surgeon would himself be in quarantine if he inspected a vessel before the completion of the ten days therein referred to. Were there to be in Aden a floating hospital, with a medical officer or officers practically in perpetual quarantine, this would not matter; but so long as the Port Surgeon is the " officer appointed for the purpose," and assuming that the fact of his boarding a vessel in quarantine would compromise him, I would suggest the omission of the words " and inspection " in the second line of this paragraph. If it is held that a medical officer can proceed on board a vessel in quarantine without compromising himself, then the words above noted may stand. Rules IV and V. In both these rules it should be made clear that the " inspection " therein referred to can only be made by day-light. Any inspection by night must necessarily be incomplete and un- satisfactory, and with no one to assist him, the Port Surgeon could not be expected to do this duty by night. I would suggest the addition of the words " by day-light " after the word " inspection " wherever it occurs in these two rules. In regard to giving effect to the rules the Port Surgeon has drawn attention to the following facts:- (a)  That while disinfection is to be mainly relied on in  future for the treatment of infected ships, there is no   disinfecting  stove
?366                               Measures to prevent the                [ APP. IX. or other appliance in Aden, nor has the Port Surgeon any staff or means at his disposal for carrying out the disinfection provided in Rule VII, and that this work if left to the vessels themselves, especially when there is no medical officer on board, will be certain to be imperfectly done. (b) That as medical inspection cannot, under present condi- tions, be held at night, vessels arriving from infected ports during the night-time and departing before day-break cannot be ad- mitted to free pratique. (c)  That if all onward bound vessels (such as are referred to in Rule V) arriving at night-time are to be visited on arrival,   it   will be necessary to appoint a special officer for that  purpose,   as   one officer cannot carry on such duties by night as well as by day. The Port Surgeon suggests that in such cases, as the vessel   cannot be admitted to pratique during the night-time, it   would be   sufficient to send the usual form of report on board   to be filled in   by   the   com- mander or medical officer, instead of taking the report orally from him alongside. In this case the appointment of a special officer would not be neces- sary. In this proposal I am prepared to concur  so   long   as   the   work   is carried on unaided by the Port Surgeon. BENGAL. No. 3718 (Medical), dated Calcutta, the 17th July 1897.                     NO. 92. From-C. E. A. W. OLDHAM, Esq., Officiating Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 1625, dated 1st June 1897, addressed to this Government in the Marine Department, forwarding, with the comments of the Government of India, a copy of a translation of the Convention framed at the Sanitary Conference recently held at Venice for the purpose of considering measures to prevent the spread of the plague. 2.  The   principal   points   in   the  letter   which  call for remark at present are the following:- (a)  Notification under Chapter II, section I of the Convention. (b) Measures to be taken on the departure of vessels from  infect- ed ports. (c)  Measures to be taken at ports of arrival. 3.  As  regards   notification   of   plague   cases,   it  appears   to   the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor that  no action is needed at present.
APP. IX. ]                 spread of infection by sea.                           367 If plague broke out anywhere,   information  of   the   occurrence  would be communicated to the Government of India, by whom the necessary notification   would   be   issued.      Paragraph 2 of section I, Chapter II of  the   Convention,   enjoins   that  medical   men    should   be   obliged to report all cases of plague, in order that each   Government   may  be informed   of   real or suspicious cases occurring within its jurisdiction. Such an obligation   has   been   enforced   in the    case  of Calcutta by Rule 2 of Plague Notification   No.   7   of this  Government,   dated   the 12th   March   1897,   under   which  every   medical   practitioner,   police officer or municipal servant is bound to report cases of plague   to   the Health   Officer   of Calcutta, who in his turn would report the same to Government through the Chairman of the Corporation.    For the   rest of   Bengal,  the  reporting   of   plague  cases has not been   enjoined in order to discourage the reporting of bogus cases, but in the executive orders issued with Mr. Risley's   letter   No.   1366-Medical, dated   the 12th March 1897 (copy enclosed), it was directed that enquiries should be made  at  all  chaukidari   parades   in   the   mufassal   whether  any Marwari or other traders have arrived   in   the   village   recently  from the  Bombay  Presidency or Sind, and whether any deaths from   fever have occurred among such persons or   among   persons   living  in   the same house  with him.     In mufassal towns the registration of deaths is in the hands of the police, and any case of plague would at once be brought to the notice of the Civil Surgeon. His Honour considers these measures as sufficient, and does not propose to issue any formal notification on the subject, which would only alarm people and lead to fever cases being reported as plague. 4. As regards the measures to be taken on the departure of vessels from infected ports, it is laid down in the Convention that every person sailing on the vessel must be examined on shore and by day at the time of embarkation by a medical officer appointed by Govern- ment, and that the Consular Authority interested in the ship may be present at the inspection. Although the port of Calcutta is not infected, the Government of India consider it desirable that the special rules made for this port should be assimilated, in the case of vessels sailing for ports out of India, as far as possible to those which will under the terms of the Convention, have to be adopted at the infected ports of the Bombay Presidency. Owing to the peculiar conditions of the port of Calcutta, stretching as it does along the bank of a tidal river at all times difficult of navigation, and where the departure of vessels is regulated by the flow of the tide, and necessarily confined to a short period of time, it appears to Mr. Stevens to be no easy matter to comply with the requirements of the above provision of the Convention without interfering with the convenience of passengers and possibly causing steamers to miss a tide, These difficulties are
368                            Measures to prevent the                [ APP. IX. enhanced by the practice of passengers going on board at other points than the jetties, and when pressed for time proceeding by train to Diamond Harbour to embark there. The inconvenience felt was brought to the notice of Government in the representation from the Liners' Conference of Calcutta and the Bengal Chamber of Com- merce (a copy of which was communicated to the Government of India with this office letter No. 355-T.-M., dated 12th June 1897) in connection with the working of Rule 4 of Plague Notification No. 3 of the 25th May. It was urged that before that rule was enforced, it was the invariable custom to obtain the bill of health, port clearance, etc., while the loading was being completed, so that the vessel might leave the next morning. In the case of steamers, work went on throughout the night, and often up to the very moment of starting. Under Rule 4 this could not be done, for a vessel completing her loading on a Friday evening had to wait for her bill of health which, when obtained, had to be presented at the Custom House for port clearance, and, if the vessel were foreign bound, taken to a Consul for countersignature. By the time all this was done, it would be too late for a start, and the ship would have to remain where she was till Sunday. In the case of a ship finishing her loading on a Saturday, two days would be lost, as a bill of heath, or certainly a port clearance, could not be obtained on Sunday, and the vessel would, therefore, be detained till Tuesday. Then, again, by the time the Custom House was open, the tide would usually be lost; and, further, there are fre- quently two or more vessels clearing in one day, which would naturally delay the Port Health Officer, 5. The Plague Notification No. 3 of the 25th May has, therefore, been further revised, so as to bring its provisions into accord with the instructions contained in paragraph 5 of your letter under reply and paragraph 3 of your letter No. 1674 of the 9th June 1897, and with a view to meet at the same time the objections urged upon this Govern- ment by the shipping representatives, and the difficulties which must attend the carrying out of such regulations in a tidal port like Calcutta. A copy of the revised draft of the notification is submitted for the approval of the Government of India. An endeavour has been made to minimise the inconveniences complained of by the Liners' Conference by the expedient adopted in Rule 1 of the notification of appointing commissioned medical officers to grant certificates to passengers and making them form part of the bill of health, and by omitting all reference to cargo in the bill of health. People who want to go on board at Diamond Harbour or Garden Reach, instead of at the docks or jetties, will obtain a certificate from one of the Presidency Surgeons, and this certificate will be attached to the bill of health. As it is proposed to invest only Presidency Surgeons with power to
APP. IX. ]                 spread of infection by sea.                          369 grant such certificates, the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor does not anticipate that any objection can be taken to this course. As regards cargo, no inspection or examination of it is, or can possibly be, made by the Health Officer; he cannot ascertain by merely looking down the hatchways whether the cargo is infected or not. The Convention requires the Health Officer to disinfect suspected articles, and this has been provided for in Rule 3. Under paragraph 9 of your letter, the mercantile community of Calcutta will be asked to consider whether, in order to protect the clean ports, prohibitive orders should issue with regard to all or any of the susceptible articles mentioned in the Convention. If it is decided to issue such orders, both Rule 3 of Plague Notification No. 3 and the bill of health will have to be modified. But the reference will take time, and His Honour does not consider it necessary to delay the issue of the Plague Notification on this account. 6.  In  connection with the use of a "disinfection lighter," referred to in Rule 3, I am to observe that a proposal is now under considera- tion to have a floating disinfector for the Port  of Calcutta.    A large- sized  Equifex  disinfector,  which  has  been  ordered  by the Calcutta Municipality, will be mounted on a barge or  cargo-boat and   kept  on the  river,  and  will  be  available  for  use  by  the Town and Port of Calcutta, as well as by the Municipality of Howrah  and   other Muni- cipalities on  the river's edge.    This will in many cases be more con- venient for suspected articles than disinfection on shore, and  will  fre- quently be the only means of effectually disinfecting a ship which has no disinfecting stove. 7.  Rule   5  has  been  drafted   so  as   to  avoid,   as far as possible causes for detention, while maintaining sufficient precautions against a breach  of the terms of the Convention.    Under clause (b) of the rule, the Collector of Customs has been authorized  to  grant  port clearance under  section  66  of the Sea Customs Act on a guarantee being given by the agents of a vessel that within 48 hours of  departure  they  will produce  a  duplicate  copy  of  the  bill   of  health,   as finally granted, signed by the Port Health Officer, or an additional Port Health Officer, and that if for any reason the Health   Officer  should  refuse  to grant the bill of health, they will bring the vessel back to her moorings. 8.  No  provision  has  been  made in the notification for a Consular Officer being present at the medical inspection of passengers who  are passed  by a  medical  officer other than the Port Health Officer, under the proviso to Rule 1.  But this point is not likely to be pressed.   Only Presidency  Surgeons  would  be  appointed   under  the   proviso, and Consular Officers would doubtless accept their certificates. 9.  I  am  at the same time to submit, for the approval  of the Government of India, a copy of a draft of the quarantine rules for the c 47
?370                            Measures to prevent the                  [ APP. IX. port of Calcutta, which have been revised with reference to Chapter II, section VIII of the Convention and paragraph 10 of your letter com- menting thereon, which it is proposed to issue in the Marine Depart- ment of this Government. Rule IV enjoins that if there is any case of sickness on board, and the pilot has reason to believe that it is plague, he shall telegraph to the Health Officer from Saugor, and shall not proceed beyond Diamond Harbour without the permission of the Health Officer. In this connection, I am to observe that strong feeling was evoked in Calcutta some months ago by the proposal to embark at Diamond Harbour pilgrims proceeding to the Hedjaz. In point of fact the scheme was a pis-aller. It was argued, however, that in the view of foreign nations Diamond Harbour was the same as Calcutta, and that the formation of a plague camp there would lead to Calcutta being quarantined. To this argument it may be replied that Diamond Harbour has, ever since 1894, and, indeed, long before that, been the quarantine station of Calcutta, and plague patients disembarked there for isolation, etc., are just as likely to damage the reputation of Calcutta as pilgrims embarked there. Only recently, in fact, a return ship load of 443 pilgrims, who had come from the infected port of Jeddah, was disembarked and disinfected there. But, apart from this possibly sentimental objection, there is some real danger that whatever pre- cautions may be taken plague may be communicated to the coolies, stevedores and other persons connected with shipping who work at Diamond Harbour, and pass between there and Calcutta. For these reasons it seems to the Officiating Lieutenant-Governor desirable that an attempt should be made to find another quarantine station, and the Sanitary Commissioner, Bengal, has been requested to report on the question in communication with the Port Officer and the Port Commis- sioners. A separate communication will be addressed to the Govern- ment of India as soon as this report is received. 10. Meanwhile, I am to ask that any orders that the Government of India may pass on the revised Plague Notification No. 3, and on the revised Quarantine Rules, may be communicated to this Government at an early date. No. 93. No. 1905, dated Simla, the 6th August 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT,  Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the  Government of India, Home Department, To-The Officiating Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Municipal (Medical) Department. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 3718 (Medical), dated the 17th July, on the subject of the revision in accordance with the Venice Sanitary Convention of the rules issued by the Government of Bengal for the prevention of the spread of plague infection by
?APP. IX.]               spread of infection by sea.                          371 vessels departing from and arriving at the port of Calcutta. I am at the same time to forward, for the information of the Government of Bengal, a copy of correspondence with the Government of Bombay with regard to the alteration of the rules issued by that Government under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Act I of 1870, so as to bring them into accord with the provisions of the Venice Convention. 2. Paragraphs 4 to 8 of your letter under reply  discuss the   draft rules  prescribing  the   measures to  be   taken on   the departure  of vessels from the port of Calcutta, contained  in draft  Plague   Notifi- cation No. 3 appended to your letter.    In paragraph   5 of  my  letter No. 1625, dated the ist June, and in  paragraph   3 (ii)   of my letter No. 1674, dated the 9th June, it was desired that in  conformity with the Convention all persons sailing on the vessel should be   examined on shore prior to the departure of the vessel.    In paragraph 4 of your letter under reply the Government of Bengal represents that, owing to the peculiar   conditions of  the   port of Calcutta, it is difficult  to comply with this requirement of the Convention without  interfering with the convenience of passengers, and possibly causing steamers to miss a tide.    In the succeeding four paragraphs an account is given of the measures proposed  with a view to   minimize   this inconvenience and the   possibility of delay.    It  will be   seen   from the correspon- dence with the Government of Bombay  forwarded  with  this  letter that it has been found impossible to insist  on the   examination of all persons on   shore in  the   case   of   vessels  sailing  from the   port  of Bombay, and that the Government of Bombay have   been  authorized to retain the existing procedure which has been worked with  marked success, and under which the examination  is   made   on board  or  on shore as may be the  more   convenient.    As it has  thus   been   found impossible to comply literally with this requirement  of the   Conven- tion at the infected port of Bombay, the Government  of India will no longer press for compliance in the case of the  uninfected   port  of Calcutta, and they therefore authorize   the  continuance   at that port of the more convenient procedure of examination on board.    I am to add that the Government of India have  no objection to the proposed arrangements under which (1) the bill of health will contain no refer- ence to the cargo; (ii) the Collector of  Customs will be authorized to grant port clearance  on a guarantee being  given by  the  agents of a vessel that   within 48 hours  of  departure they will   produce  a duplicate copy of the bill of health as finally granted,   signed   by  the Port Health Officer,  and that if  for any   reason  the Health   Officer should refuse to grant the bill of health,   they   will bring  the   vessel back to her moorings; and  (iii) the   disinfection of  contaminated   or suspected articles will be performed either on shore or on a lighter.
?372                        Measures to prevent the                  [ APP. IX. 3. The only matter in connection with the regulations about which I am to invite the special attention of the Government of Bengal is the procedure to be followed when a case of plague is discovered at the time of the examination on board. Rules 2 and 3 of draft Plague Notification No. 3 correctly define the precautionary measures which are to be adopted when a case of plague is discovered on board, but Rule 8 permits the grant of a clean bill of health when these precautions have been duly carried out. This latter provision is not in accordance with the terms of the Convention which permit a vessel sailing from an infected port to be treated as healthy only when no case of plague has occurred either before departure, during the voyage or on arrival (Chapter II, section VIII). The adoption of the prescribed precautions cannot alter the fact that the vessel is infected. If, therefore, a case which is ascertained or believed to be plague is discovered during the examination on board, the fact must be stated in the bill of health, together with the precautionary measures adopted. 4.  I am to request that, with the permission   of   His  Honour  the Lieutenant-Governor, the rules   in  draft   Plague   Notification  No.   3 may be revised in  accordance  with  the remarks   in   the preceding paragraph. 5.  The draft quarantine rules forwarded   with your letter appear to the Government of India to be generally well adapted to   meet the requirements of the Venice Convention.    I am to convey the   follow- ing observations with regard to  them for the consideration of   His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor:- (1)  The draft notification  is framed  under the  Quarantine Act, I of 1870, and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The Gov- ernment of India consider that it will be more convenient that the rules should issue under the Epidemic Diseases Act alone. The reference in the draft notification to the sanc- tion of the Governor-General in Council will then be un- necessary, but a notification should issue under Act I of 1870, cancelling the existing quarantine rules for the port of Calcutta which have been issued under that Act. (2)   The draft notification states that " the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal has been pleased to make the following rules for quarantine against plague, etc." In this form the rules would be of permanent application, and would therefore be contrary to the orders contained in paragraph 4 of Home Department Resolution No. 8-95 (Sanitary), dated the 9th May 1897. I am to suggest that the wording might be altered to the following: "The Lieutenant-Governor of
?APP. IX. ]              spread of infection by sea.                            373 Bengal   has   been  pleased  to  prescribe  as  a temporary measure the following rules for quarantine against plague." (3) In Rule I the following definition is given of the term obser- vation:   "The term   observation means that  the  persons subjected to it will be  segregated  on board ship   or  in   a lazaretto or  isolation   camp  till  they  have  obtained   free pratique."    It appears from Rules VIII (6) and IX (3) that the words "on board ship" in this definition mean on board the    ship  on  which the person  arrived.    This  is  not  in accordance with the definition of the term observation con- tained in the footnote to   Chapter II,   section VIII   of the Venice Convention.    The words there used are "on board a ship" ( board d'un navire), meaning on board a vessel used as a lazaretto.    The   Government  of  India  consider that the words "on board ship" should be struck out of the definition in Rule I; and that,   in accordance with  the  in- structions contained in paragraphs 11 and   12 of  my  letter No. 1625, dated the   1st  June,   healthy passengers should never be detained on board ship, but should be landed, and, when necessary,  kept under observation or surveillance  on shore.    I am to  request  that,   with the permission of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor,   Rules VII (3),   VIII   (6) and IX (3) may be revised   in  accordance  with these  in- structions.    In the case of  infected ships  [Rule VII   (3)], no one among  those  arriving on   the vessel  should be left on board,   except the  persons, if  any,  whose  presence  is necessary for the care of the vessel. 6. With reference to the remarks contained in the last paragraph of your letter, I am to say that the Government of India have no objection to the establishment of a new quarantine station further re- moved than the present station from the persons connected with the shipping work at Diamond Harbour. If due precautions are taken, it does not appear to the Government of India to be likely that foreign Governments will take any objection to measures which are carried out in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Venice Convention.

Under-clothing, bedding, wearing apparel, mattresses, carpets, etc., which are contaminated or suspected, should be disinfected in stoves at normal presssure, or at a pressure of from one-and-a-half to two degrees, with or without the presence of steam. Before a stove is passed as efficient for the purposes of disinfec- tion, it should be subjected to a test, with the aid of a signal thermo- meter, showing the moment when the temperature in the middle of a mattress rises to at least 100 (centigrade). To ensure that the disinfection is effective, this temperature must be maintained for from 10 to 15 minutes. Disinfecting solutions- (a) Solution of corrosive sublimate, of 1 part in 1,000, with the addition of 10 parts of chloride of soda. The solution should be coloured with aniline dye or indigo.

Notification No. 160-Marine, dated the 24th August 1897. In exercise of the power conferred by section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, III of 1897, and by the Notification of the Government of India in the Home Department, No. 302, dated the 4th February 1897, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal has been pleased to prescribe, as a temporary measure, the following rules for quarantine against plague, and for the medical inspection, isolation, observation and surveillance of persons suffering from, or suspected of being infected with, plague.

(6)   Surveillance.-The    term    "surveillance"   means   that   the persons subjected to it will   not  be  isolated; they  will   at once obtain free pratique, but, on   arriving   at   their   des- tination, they will be kept under medical supervision. II.  Hoisting of   yellow flag.-The   commander   of   every vessel, including buggalows or other native craft, (a) arriving from an   infect- ed port, or (b) having plague on board, or (c) on board of which one or more cases of plague have taken place within twelve days of her arrival, shall, on arrival at the Sandheads,   hoist   a  yellow   flag,   and indicate by signal the port from which she has come, and shall keep   such   flag and signal flying until   permitted   in   writing   by   the   Health   Officer to haul it down.    The   pilot,   on   going   alongside   such   vessel,   shall direct the flag prescribed above to be hoisted, if that has  not  already been done. * N.B.-Pilotage is compulsory for all vessels over 100 tons in the port of Calcutta III.

Such period must not exceed ten days from the date of the last case, whe- ther that occurred on boardship or during the period of observation on shore. It is also in the discretion of the Health Officer to allow such persons to proceed to their destination on their giving a written undertaking, in the form annexed as Appendix I, to submit themselves to surveillance by the medical officer (if any) appointed for the purpose, at their destination, for a period of ten days from the date of the arrival of the ship.

(9) When these rules have been fully complied  with,   the   Health Officer shall, by an order in writing under his hand,   to   be delivered to the   commander,   permit  the  yellow   flag  to be hauled down. IX. Rules relating to healthy ships- (1)  A healthy ship shall be given  free pratique at   once,   what- ever may be the nature of her bill of health. (2)   Such a ship may, at the discretion of  the Health   Officer,   be subjected to the measures prescribed in Rules VIII (2), VIII (3) and VIII (4), but the ship itself may not be disinfected as in Rule VIII (5), except with the consent of the commander or agent. (3)   Passengers who, on medical inspection, are suspected  by  the Health Officer to be infected with plague may be de- tained under observation in an isolation hospital appointed for the purpose for ten days from the date on which the ship left an infected port, or, if plague occurs among them while under observation, from the date of the last case. (4)   The crew will not be  allowed to  land,  except on   duty,   ten days from the date on which the ship left an infected port. (5)  The  crew   and   passengers   may, at the   discretion    of  the Health Officer, be subjected to surveillance in the manner described in Rule VIII (8) for a period of ten days from the date on which the ship left an infected port. (6)   When these rules have been fully complied with, the  Health Officer shall, by an order in writing under his hand, to be delivered to the commander, permit the yellow flag to be hauled down. (7)  None of the above   measures  will be considered  necessary when the ship has been given free pratique at Colombo or other intermediate port. X. Ships carrying a doctor or a stove.-In exercising the discretion vested in him by the rules under heads VII, VIII and IX above, the Health Officer should take into consideration the fact of there being a doctor, or a disinfecting apparatus (stove), on board the ship in question,

Rules relating to crowded and  insanitary  ships.-Crowded ships, ships   carrying emigrants or   return pilgrims and   ships  which appear to be in an insanitary   state   may,   at   the   discretion   of   the Health Officer, be treated as suspected ships under head  VIII. XII.  Right of ship to put back to   sea.-Any   ships  objecting to submit   to the   obligations imposed by these rules will be free to put back to sea.   Such objection must be notified on or before arriving at Diamond Harbour. XIII.  Rules applying to ships claiming right to put  back to  sea. -If   ships   claiming the right to put back to sea desire to   disembark passengers or land goods, they must   submit to the   rules   relating to suspected ships. XIV.  Provisions  and  stores.-It will  be the   duty  of  the   Port Officer to   facilitate   the   conveyance to all   vessels in   quarantine   of such supplies of provisions,   stores  and   other articles as may be   re- quired by those  on board.    Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessels in   quarantine to be   subsequently   removed by    mem- bers of their crews. APPENDIX I.

Signed In the presence of Health Officer. APPENDIX II. Instructions for disinfection. 1.  Personal effects,   rags,  infected  bandages,  papers and   other articles, without value, should be destroyed by fire. 2.  Under-clothing, bedding, wearing apparel, mattresses, carpets, etc., which are contaminated or suspected,  should   be   disinfected   in stoves at normal pressure, or at a pressure  of from one-and-a-half to two degrees, with or without the presence of steam. Before a stove is passed as efficient for the purposes of disinfec- tion, it should be subjected to a test, with the aid of a signal ther- mometer, showing the moment when the temperature in the middle of a mattress rises to, at least, 100 (centigrade).

Disinfecting solutions- (a)   Solution of corrosive   sublimate, of 1 part in 1,000, with the addition of 10 parts of chloride of soda. The solution should be coloured  with aniline   dye or indigo.    It should not be placed in metal vessels. (b)   A 5 per cent. solution of pure crystallized carbolic acid, or 5 per cent. of crude commercial  carbolic acid,   in a warm soft soap. (c)   Fresh slaked-lime.* 4. Special instructions to be observed in the employment of disin- fecting solutions. The linen, clothing and articles, soiled by the excreta of patients, should be soaked in the solution of corrosive sublimate. The solution of pure carbolic acid, and the solution of soap and carbolic acid, are equally suited to the purpose. The articles should remain in the solution for at least six hours. Articles which cannot be subjected to the temperature of the stove (100 centigrade) without injury, such as leather goods, wooden arti- cles stuck together with glue, felt, velvet, silk, etc., should be washed with the solution of corrosive sublimate; coins can be disinfected with the solution of soap and carbolic acid. Persons engaged in nursing the sick should wash their hands and faces with the solution of corrosive sublimate, or with one of the car- bolic solutions. The carbolic solutions will be useful, more particularly for disin- fecting articles, such as metals, instruments, etc., which can neither be subjected to a temperature of 100 centigrade, nor placed in contact with corrosive sublimate. Slaked-lime is particularly recommended for disinfecting excreta. Expectorated matter should be burnt. 5. Disinfection of ships with plague-patients on board. The cabin or cabins, and all parts of the ship occupied by the sick or suspected, should be cleared out, and all articles in them should be treated as described above. * To get very strong slaked-lime, take lime of good quality, slake it, by moisten- ing it gradually with half its weight of water. When the operation is completed, put the powder in a carefully-corked receptacle, and place it in a dry spot. As each kilogram- me of lime absorbs 500 grammes of water in order to become slack, it acquires a volume of 2 litres 200, and it is sufficient to dilute it with double its volume of water, say 4 kilogrammes 400 grammes, to obtain a white-wash, which will be of about 20 per cent. strength of lime.

The partitions should be disinfected with the solution of corrosive sublimate, with an addition of 10 per cent. of alcohol. The wash- ing should commence from the top, horizontally, and be continued downwards, so that the whole surface of the partition becomes covered, with a coating of minute drops. The boarding should be washed with the same solution. Two hours after, the walls and flooring should be washed over with plenty of water. 6. Disinfection of the hold of an infected ship. To disinfect the hold, sulphate of iron, in quantity sufficient to neutralize the sulphurated hydrogen, should first be thrown in, the bilge-water should be pumped out, and the hold washed with sea- water. Solution of corrosive sublimate should then be thrown in. The bilge-water should not be pumped out while the ship is in port.                                   ______ No. 161-Marine, dated the 27th August 1897. NOTIFICATION-By the Government of Bengal, Marine Department. With the previous sanction of the Governor General in Council, the Lieutenant-Governor is pleased to declare that the rules for qua- rantine against plague, promulgated in the Notifications issued by this Department, Nos. 126-Marine and 53-Marine, dated, respec- tively, the 20th October 1896 and 2nd March 1897, are cancelled, with effect from the 26th August 1887, the date on which the revised rules for quarantine, issued under the provisions of Act III of 1897, and published in this Department Notification No. 160-Marine, dated the 24th August 1897, come into operation. MADRAS. No. 96. No. 602 (Marine), dated Ootacamund, the 6th July 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of  Madas, Public Works De- partaient, To-The  Secretary to  the Government of India,   Home   Department. With reference to your letter No. 1624, dated 1st June 1897, I am directed to say that a copy of the quarantine rules for Madras, revised in accordance with the remarks contained therein, will follow as soon as practicable. Meanwhile I am to ask for a decision on the following questions:- (a) whether in the case of a vessel from, say, Calcutta, calling at Madras on her way home, all the crew is to be brought on shore and inspected there; or (b) whether it will suffice to inspect the persons who join at Madras; and
?APP.

This is probably not intended, as it would expose them to infection. 2.  Meanwhile, with reference to the  penultimate sentence of para- graph   5 of  your  letter, it   has   been   directed  that   Madras  and  all other ports in this Presidency from which vessels sailed direct to foreign countries or Burma shall be regarded as infected ports for the  purpose of outward inspection. 3.  The  rules for   the outward bound vessels cannot be revised till this Government is in   possession of the  Bombay  rules, on which   the Madras rules   must,   in  accordance with the instructions   contained in clause (b), paragraph 5 of your letter, be based.    Application  has been made to the Bombay Government for a copy of its rules. No. 97. No. 1832 (Sanitary), dated Simla, the 17th July 1897. From-J. P.  HEWETT,  Esq.,  C.I E., Secretary  to  the  Government  of India, Home Department, To-The    Secretary    to    the  Government  of   Madras,   Public   Works Department. I am directed to reply to your No. 602 (Marine), dated the 6th instant, on the subject of modification, in accordance with the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897, of the rules issued by the Government of Madras for the quarantine of vessels arriving from infected ports, and for the examination of persons sailing on vessels departing from ports in the Madras Presidency. 2.  The decision of the Government of India is asked for on   certain questions set forth in the first paragraph of your   letter.    With   regard to questions (a), (b) and (c), I am to  say that in   the case of  a  vessel starting  from,   say,   Calcutta,   and calling at Madras or any other port in the Madras Presidency on   her way home, neither the crew nor  the passengers  already  on   board need be brought on shore and inspected there.    It will suffice to inspect the  persons   who  join  the  vessel at Madras or other port of call. 3.   With regard to  question (d),   I am to say that the   Government of India consider that in the case of vessels sailing to foreign countries from ports in   the   Madras  Presidency, the crew should be brought on shore for inspection.    Chapter I, section ii,   Article I of  the   Conven- tion  requires  the  medical inspection on shore of every  person sailing on the ship.    This includes the examination on shore of the crew.    The precaution would seem to be necessary since, in   the   case   of a  vessel sailing from an infected port, it is probable that some persons   amongst the   crew  might  have  recently mixed with the infected population of the place, and the crew   should   therefore  be   examined   in   order  to c 49

The ports of the Madras Presidency not being infected the matter is of less importance in that Presidency. But it is possible that some mem- bers of the crew might have come from an infected district to join the ship, and, as is stated in paragraph 5 of my letter No. 1624, dated the 1st June, the Government of India consider it desirable that the modified rules to be issued by the Government of Madras should conform, as far as possible, to the terms of the Convention. The Madras ports not being infected there can be no danger in landing the crew. In the case of an infected port it would be necessary to adopt due pre- cautions. 4. In   conclusion,  I am to say that the Government of India will be glad to receive copies of the modified rules as soon as they  are issued. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Madras, Marine  Department, No. 493, dated the 28th May 1897. Read the following paper:- No.98 No. 1862, dated Vriddhachalam, the 19th May 1897. From-A. E. CASTLESTUART STUART, Esq., Collector of South Arcot, To-The Secretary to the Government of Madras,   Marine   Department. I have the honour to request the favour of an authoritative ruling by Government on the following point:- Is a vessel calling at the port of Cuddalore and bound thence for Bombay vi Negapatam and Colombo liable to be inspected by the Port Health Officer for the purposes of Act III of 1897 (the Epidemic Diseases Act) ? 2.  Under paragraph 2 of the Notification ordered to  be  published by Government in G. O. No. 323 (Marine), dated the 1st  April   1897, "all other officers appointed Health   Officers   under   the   said   Act  or otherwise will exercise their powers in the case of  all   vessels  leaving the ports for which they have been appointed for  whatever destina- tion such vessels may be declared." 3.  In obedience to the terms of this Notification which are printed in italics, the Health Officer at   the   port   of   Cuddalore, inspected the British India Steam Navigation Company's  S.S.   Chanda on 5th May 1897 before she left the port bound for   Bombay vi  Negapatam  and Colombo.    The   commander took  exception to this inspection, urging that as his vessel was not bound  for   "any  port  out  of India" from Cuddalore, but  directly for Negapatam-another  port in   India-no such inspection was necessary. 4.  The Notification ordered to be  published   by   Government  in G.   O. No. 344 (Marine), dated  8th April 1897, apparently lends sup- port  to  the  commander's  objection, though   it   would   seem  to  be
?APP. IX. ]                 spread of infection by sea.                              387 contradictory to the Notification referred to in paragraph 2, supra. By the later Notification-the former being also in force-His Excellen- cy the Governor in Council was pleased "to declare that all vessels and persons leaving" certain ports in the Madras Presidency, of which Cuddalore is one, "for ports out of India shall be subjected to the regulations" therein formulated. Paragraph 2 of these regulations runs: "No vessel shall leave any such port for any port out of India until she has been inspected by the Health Officer of the Port," etc. The words which are printed in italics might be taken to mean that a vessel leaving Cuddalore directly for Negapatam-which is not "a port out of India"-need not be inspected by the Health Officer whereas the former Notification makes it clear that Health Officers are to exercise their powers "in the case of all vessels leaving the ports for which they have been appointed for whatever destination such vessels may be declared. 5. I venture to submit that, during the continuance of the plague epidemic, it is desirable that all vessels should be inspected at each of the ports specified in the later Notification before leaving such ports for whatever declared destination. Order thereon by the Government of Madras. His Excellency the Governor in Council observes that the rules printed with G. O. No. 344 (Marine), dated 9th April 1897, render inspection compulsory in the case of all vessels leaving for any port "out of India," and paragraph 2 of the Notification printed with G. O. No. 323 (Marine), dated 1st April 1897, directs Health Officers to exercise their powers of inspection on all outward vessels for "whatever destination such vessels may be declared." There is nothing incon- sistent in the rules as they stand, and as one rule is not declared to have superseded the other, both are in force, and should be acted on. The intention is to extend the power of inspection prescribed in the rules printed with G. O. No. 344 (Marine), dated 8th April 1897. The order of dates of the two Notifications was accidental.

No person shall be permitted to embark on board a vessel with- in any such port bound direct for any port out of India, who has, with- in the preceding ten days, resided in a part of India  believed  by  the Health   Officer   of  the  port  to  be   infected   with plague.    Any port may be declared "infected" by the Government or by the   "Sanitary authority." 2.  No deck passenger, who appears to the Port Officer  to  belong to the labouring classes, shall be permitted to embark on board a vessel at the port of Tuticorin bound for a port in   Ceylon,   until   he or   she has  satisfied  the   Medical   Officer   of the Government of that Colony stationed at Tuticorin that he or she has not, within the preceding  ten days,   resided   in a    part   of   India    infected   by  the   plague,   and that he or  she   is  free from   infection with the plague, and until the said   Colonial   Officer   has  so  certified  in  respect of such passenger. The Health Officer of the port of Tuticorin shall not deliver  a  bill  of health  in  respect  of  any  such  vessel,  if there be on board any such passenger in respect of whom the Colonial Officer has not  certified  as aforesaid. 3.  No vessel shall leave any such port  for  any port  out  of India direct,   until   she has been inspected by the Health Officer of the port, and the master or person in charge of such  vessel  has   obtained  from such  officer a bill of health or certificate in the form given below   that the  officers   and   crew   of,   and   also  the passenger   (if any) by, such vessel are free from the bubonic plague:- Bill of Health.

It is further certified that the town and port of                            are at present free* from plague: Provided that-  Proviso (1) does not apply to vessels sailing for Burma which must not be allowed to leave the port of Madras without medical inspection as prescribed in these regulations. (i) a vessel which has obtained a clean bill of health at any port of the Madras Presidency shall not be liable to further inspection during the same voyage if there has been no case of plague on board meanwhile, and the vessel has not subsequently touched at any port which has been declared infected, or taken up passengers at  other than inspection ports; and (ii) all vessels belonging to the Ceylon Government which may leave ports in the Madras Presidency with emigrants for Ceylon shall be exempted from medical inspection. 4. The medical inspection of passengers and other persons pre- scribed in these regulations must be of each individual by day, on shore, at the time of embarkation: Provided that-  In the  case  of  the  officers and crew of  a vessel being  brought on     shore for inspection they  may come in batches.

Vessels not leaving port before 6 A.M. of the day   following the medical inspection may not leave without re-inspection and the grant of a fresh bill of health. 6.  Should the Health Officer of the  port be   of opinion  that any person on board of any vessel  so  inspected  is suffering  from  the bubonic plague or from any illness which he suspects may prove to be plague, he shall refuse to give a bill of health as aforesaid unless   and until such person, together with  his or her attendants and relatives and their baggage and personal effects, have been removed from  the vessel and such parts of the vessel as have been frequented  by such persons shall have been disinfected to the satisfaction  of  the   Health Officer.    Such removal and disinfection shall be noted on the  bill of health.    The baggage and effects  of  such   persons  as  are  removed from or prevented from sailing in any vessel under this rule shall  be disinfected on shore in such manner as the Port Health Officer directs before such baggage and personal effects are permitted on   board any vessel. 7.  All persons so removed shall be detained in a plague hospital or place of observation appointed by the Sanitary authority, as the   case may be; and shall not leave such  hospital   or  place  until the   Chief Medical Officer present at the spot shall have certified that  they  are free from the infection of the plague. * Note.-Mail bags are included in "cargo" under this Regulation. 8.  After the master or person in charge of the vessel has obtained a bill of health under  the  provisions of   these  regulations,    no  person   or cargo* or goods of any kind shall   be embarked or disembarked before the vessel leaves the port unless such vessel is again inspected by the Port Health Officer and another bill of health obtained from such officer by the master or person in charge of such vessel. If the necessity of a fresh inspection by the Port Health Officer under this regulation arises from any default or act of the master or agents of the vessel, of which the Port Officer shall be the sole judge, such fresh inspection shall not take place until after the payment to the Port Officer by the master or agents of such vessel of such fee for such inspection, not being less than five nor more than fifty rupees, as the Port Officer in his sole discretion may order. 9. No port clearance shall be delivered to any vessel bound from any such port to any port out of India unless and until the master or person in charge thereof shall produce a bill of health obtained as aforesaid; and it shall be the duty of the Customs Officer to refuse delivery of the port clearance without the production of such bill of health.

No. 100. No. 2184, dated Simla, the 28th September 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT,   Esq.,  C.I.E.,  Secretary to  the  Government  of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Madras, Marine Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 791-Marine, dated the 11th instant, forwarding a copy of the revised rules issued by the Government of Madras on the same date for the inspection of outward-bound vessels. The rules appear to the Govern- ment of India to be in general well adopted to meet the requirements of the case. I am to make the following remarks on certain points connected with them. 2.  The first of the regulations directs that no person shall   be  per- mitted  to  embark  on  board  a  vessel   bound direct for any port out of India who has, within the preceding ten days, resided  in   a part  of India believed by the Health Officer of the  Port to be   infected   with plague.    This  regulation  reproduces   in a slightly modified form the first of the rules for  vessels sailing from   Tuticorin   to   Ceylon,   pub- lished by the Government of Madras on the 22nd of February, and the first of the rules for vessels sailing from the Port of   Madras  for  ports out   of   India published on the 23rd of the same month.    At that time the Venice Convention had not yet been framed; now that the Conven- tion has been commonly accepted and   enforced the  retention of  the rule  appears  to  the Government of India to be unnecessary.    It goes beyond the requirements of the   Convention,   and,   in   the   opinion   of the   Government  of   India,  it  also goes beyond the necessities of the general case.    The case of   Ceylon   is,   however,   the   Government  of India  recognize,   somewhat apart from that of other countries outside of India, owing to its close proximity to the Indian  mainland.    If  the Government of Madras consider that the withdrawal of the rule in the case of vessels bound for Ceylon will  be  likely  to  cause  vessels  for Madras ports to  be  put  in quarantine at Colombo, then the Govern- ment of India will have no objection to its retention in this special case. 3.  Rules 6 and 7 describe correctly the action to be  taken on  the discovery of a declared or suspected case of plague on board the vessel before her departure, but no provision is made  in  the regulations for
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 393 the action to be taken should a case of plague be discovered among the persons examined on shore previous to their embarkation. It appears to the Government of India necessary that a rule should be inserted prescribing that in this event the sick person and his non-professional attendants should be prevented from embarking and segregated on shore that the baggage of these persons should not be embarked, and that articles likely to be contaminated should be disinfected on shore. 4. In a marginal note to proviso (i) of rule 3 it is stated that no vessel, even if she has started from a port in the Madras Presidency, may sail from the port of Madras to Burma without medical inspec- tion as prescribed in the regulations under reference. But it would appear from the preamble of the regulations that they apply only to vessels sailing for ports out of India. The Governments of India understand that the regulations for the inspection of vessels sailing from Madras ports to Burma contained in the Notification of the Government of Madras, No. 162, dated the 26th February, are super- seded by the present regulations. But if this is the case, then it would appear to the Government of India to be desirable that it should be definitely stated in the preamble that the rules apply to vessels bound for Burma. The point is not one of great importance, but the rules should in all respects be accu- rate in form as well as in substance, as they will remain the model for future rules in the event of their being required.

With respect to Marine Department Notification No. 167, dated 11th September 1897, published in the Fort St. George Gazette of 14th September 1897, Part I, page 1167, I beg to bring to notice that in the bill of health form therein given, there is nothing that provides- for the inspection of persons not on the ship's articles, and who are not passengers, such as the private servants of officers and engineers. These men are neither shown on the ship's articles nor on the pas- sengers' list. The master also is not mentioned in the form nor the engineers, who in the merchant service are not usually included in the expression "officer"; I therefore submit that the words "including officers and able-bodied seamen" should be deleted, and the words c 50
?394 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. "including master, mates, engineers, apprentices and private servants when the latter are not mentioned in the ship's articles" be substitut- ed, in order to include every person employed on board as distingu- ished from passengers. The expression "able-bodied seamen" seems out of place, for the expression "seaman" according to section 742 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 includes "every person (except masters, pilots and apprentices duly indentured and registered) em- ployed or engaged in any capacity on board any ship." No. 842 (Marine), dated the 27th September 1897. Order thereon by the Government of Madras, Marine Department. The amendment of the form of bill of health proposed by the Presidency Port Officer is approved and will be adopted. The follow- ing notification will be issued accordingly:- NOTIFICATION. The form of bill of health prescribed in rule 3 of the regulations, published as Notification No. 167, dated 11th September 1897, in the Fort St. George Gazette of the 14th September 1897, Part I, page 1167, will be amended as follows:- For the words "including officers and able-bodied seamen," read "including master, mates, engineers, apprentices and private servants when the latter are not mentioned in the ship's articles." No. 102. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Madras, Marine Department, No. 745, dated the 23rd August 1897. Read again- General Order No. 601 (Marine), dated 6th July 1897. Ordered that the following Notification be published in the Fort St. George and all Maritime District Gazettes:- NOTIFICATION.-In exercise of the powers delegated to him by the Governor General in Council under section 2, sub-section (3) of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, His Excellency the Governor in Council is pleased to prescribe, under the said Epidemic Diseases Act, the following temporary regulations to be observed in all ports of the Madras Presidency. These regulations will supersede those now in force and which are published on pages 601-604, Part I of the Fort St. George Gazette of the 11th May 1897. Definition, I. In these regulations- (1) "Vessel" includes anything made for the conveyance by water of human beings or of property.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 395 (2) "Port Officer" includes any person acting under the author- ity of Government in charge of port discipline. (3) "Master" when used in relation to any vessel means any person (except a pilot or harbour master) having for the time being the charge or control of the vessel. (4) "Sanitary authority" means the Collector of the District, and the Municipal Council or Local Board, the area under whose jurisdiction includes or abuts on any part of a customs port. Where a customs port is included within or abuts on the jurisdiction of more than one of the authorities above mentioned, the Governor in Council shall appoint which of them shall be the sanitary authority for the purpose of these regulations, or he may distribute among them, in such manner as he may deem fit, the duties imposed by these regulations. The jurisdiction of every sanitary authority shall, for the purposes of these regulations, extend to seaward for a distance of three miles beyond low water mark on all parts of the coast line bounding the area ordinarily under its jurisdiction. (5) "Port Health Officer" includes any duly qualified medical practitioner appointed by a sanitary authority or by the Local Government to act in the execution of these regu- lations. (6) "Observation" means segregation either on board a vessel, or in an isolation camp or place. (7) "Surveillance" means that the person subjected to it will not be isolated ; they will at once obtain free pratique, but will be kept under medical supervision. 2. (1) "Infected" used with reference to a vessel denotes any vessel with plague on board, or on board which one or more cases have taken place within twelve days. (2) "Suspected" used with reference to a vessel denotes any vessel on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure, or during the voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for twelve days. (3) "Healthy" used with reference to a vessel denotes any vessel which has come from, or which during the voyage has touched at, an infected port, but which has had no death, or case of plague on board, either before departure, during the voyage or on arrival. 3. The master of every "infected," "suspected" or "healthy" vessel shall, when within three miles of the coast of any part of the
?396 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Madras Presidency, cause to be hoisted at the foremast head the Commercial Code flag Q being a yellow flag, and shall keep the same displayed during the whole time between sunrise and sunset. If any person on board such vessel be at the time suffering or suspected to be suffering from the plague, the master shall also hoist the Commercial Code flag R below the yellow flag Q. Any such vessel arriving at a port after dark shall hoist on coming to an anchor one white light at the foremast head and one red light at the mainmast head. 4. The master of any such vessel shall before arriving at an anchorage pump out the bilge-water, if possible, after disinfection, and pass fresh sea water over the parts that have been in contract with the bilge-water. The bilge-water shall not be discharged within port limits. 5. The Port Officer on the arrival of any vessel displaying the flag or flags or light or lights aforesaid, or if he ascertains from the master of such vessel, or otherwise has reason to believe, that the vessel is infected, suspected or healthy from an infected port, shall detain such vessel, and order the master forthwith to moor or anchor the same in such place as may be fixed by him; and the master shall moor or anchor accordingly: Provided that in the case of any ship which has not communicated with the shore, the master if he objects to submit to the obligations imposed by these regulations shall be free to put back to sea. In such case the Port Officer shall send immediate information to the sanitary authorities of the port in India, Burma or Ceylon to which the vessel is bound or at which she is next about to call. 6. While a vessel shall be so detained, no person shall leave the same. 7. The Port Officer, on the approach to the port of any vessel dis- playing the flag or flags or light or lights aforesaid, or on his detaining any vessel as aforesaid, shall forthwith give notice thereof and of the cause of such detention to the Sanitary authority of the port, and also to the Port Health Officer. 8. The detention by the Port Officer of a vessel under Regulation 5 shall cease as soon as the vessel shall have been, as hereinafter provid- ed, duly visited and examined by the Port Health Officer or, if the vessel shall, upon such examination, be found to be infected or suspect- ed as soon as the same shall be moored or anchored in pursuance of Re- gulations 9 and 13. 9. The Sanitary authority shall, as speedily as practicable, with the approval of the Port Officer, fix some place where vessels may be moored or anchored for the purpose of Regulation 13; and shall
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 397 make provision for the reception of plague-patients and other per- sons removed from vessels under these regulations. The place to be fixed as aforesaid, where any vessel may be moored or anchored for the purpose of Regulation 13, shall be some place within the jurisdic- tion of the Sanitary authority, unless the local Government otherwise orders in which case the place so fixed shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be deemed to be within such jurisdiction. 10. On receiving the notice prescribed by Regulation 7 the Port Health Officer shall forthwith visit and examine the vessel, in regard to which such notice shall have been given, for the purpose of ascertain- ing whether she is infected, suspected or healthy. He shall also do so if he has reason to believe that any vessel which has arrived or is within the jurisdiction of the Sanitary authority, whether detained by the Port Officer or not, is infected or suspected, or has come from or touched at a port where plague prevails. The master of such vessel shall permit it to be so visited and examined and shall afford all reason- able facilities for such examination as the Port Health Officer may deem requisite. 11. For the purpose of ascertaining the state of the vessel as aforesaid, the Port Health Officer may demand from the doctor of the ship, or, failing him, from the master a declaration on oath whether there has been or has not been a case of plague on the ship since her departure, or whether any person suffering or suspected to be suffering from the plague has left or been removed from the vessel prior to or during the voyage, and all particulars relative to any such circum- stance ; and the doctor or the master, as the case may be, shall be bound to make a true declaration to the best of his knowledge and belief. 12. When the Port Health Officer has made such examination as aforesaid, he shall forthwith give a certificate in duplicate in the following form, or to the like effect, and shall deliver one copy to the master and transmit the other to the Sanitary authority. He shall also, if the vessel is infected or suspected, give immediate information of the fact to the Sanitary Commissioner for Madras. Certificate. day of 189. I hereby certify that I have examined the vessel , of , now lying in the port of (or detained at ), and that I find that she is (a) "infected" with plague, (b) "suspected," or
?398 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. (c) "healthy" from an infected port (as the case may be). (Signed) Port Health Officer. 13. The master of any vessel certified by the Port Health Officer to be "infected" or "suspected" shall thereupon moor or anchor her if he has not already done so at the place fixed for that purpose under Regulation 9 where she shall remain until the requirements of these regulations have been duly fulfilled, and from which she shall not depart without the written or, where communication with the vessel is imprac- ticable owing to stress of weather, the signalled permission of the Port Health Officer. 14. No person shall leave any such vessel until the examination hereinafter prescribed shall have been made. 15. (1) The Port Health Officer shall, as soon as possible, after a vessel has been certified as infected, suspected or healthy, examine every person on board the same. (2) If any person on board any such vessel is found to be suffering from plague, or from any illness which the Port Health Officer suspects may prove to be plague, the Port Health Officer shall certify accord- ingly. Every person who shall be so certified by him shall, if possible, be immediately disembarked, and shall be detained for treatment in a suitable hospital or ward or isolation camp or other place. (3) If the vessel is certified to be infected, all persons on board shall be kept under observation or surveillance, as the Port Health Officer may determine, and shall, if possible, be disembarked for the purpose. (4) All persons kept under observation, whether on shore or on board the vessel, shall be detained for such period as the Port Health Officer shall in his absolute discretion prescribe with regard to the sanitary condition of the vessel and the date of the last case of plague which has occurred among the crew or passengers, but which shall not exceed ten days from the date of the occurrence of the last case of plague which has occurred on board, or which may subsequently occur among the persons detained in such camp or place as the Sanitary authority shall have appointed for the purpose of their detention or on board the vessel, after which they shall, if certified by the Chief Medi- cal Officer on the spot to be free from the infection of plague, be per- mitted to proceed to their destination. (5) If the vessel is certified to be suspected or healthy, all per- sons on board who may disembark shall be subjected to surveil- lance either at the port or their destination as the Sanitary author- ity may direct, in the case of a suspected vessel for a period- of ten days
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 399 from the date of the arrival of the vessel in port, and in the case of a healthy vessel for the period necessary to complete a term of ten days from the date of the vessel's departure from the infected port last visited. In either case the Port Health Officer may place under observa- tion, instead of surveillance, for a term not exceeding ten days from such vessel's arrival at the port any person whom he may consider to be in any way likely to carry the infection of the plague. 16. A clean bill of health shall not be granted to an infected vessel until all the requirements of these regulations have been complied with, nor until ten days have elapsed from the date of the last case of plague which has occurred on board; nor, if the person attacked has been treated on board, until ten days from the death or recovery of such person. 17. In the case of a vessel certified to be suspected or healthy, a clean bill of health shall be given, provided the requirements of these regulations have been complied with and if ten days have elapsed since the vessel's departure from the infected port last visited. If ten days have not elapsed, the vessel may be detained in quarantine at the discretion of the Port Health Officer for the time necessary to com- plete the period of ten days, the crew and passengers being placed during such period under surveillance. Free pratique granted at Colombo or at an intermediate Indian or Burmese port shall be recog- nized. 18. No port clearance shall be granted to any vessel which has been subjected to these rules unless with the written concurrence of the Port Health Officer. 19. No person detained for treatment or placed under observation shall leave the camp or place or vessel in which he is detained under treatment or observation, until the Chief Medical Officer present at the spot shall have certified that such person is free from the infection of the plague. 20. Every person placed under surveillance shall present himself for examination by the Medical Officer appointed for this purpose, by the Sanitary authority, at such times and places as such medical offi- cer may direct. 21. If any person suffering from plague or from any illness which the Port Health Officer suspects may prove to be plague cannot be disembarked under Regulation 15, he may be detained on board the vessel, which shall remain subject, for the purpose of this regulation, to the control of the Port Health Officer. Such person shall not be removed from or leave the vessel, except with the consent, in writing, of the Port Health Officer; and, if the illness from which such person
?400 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. suffered is, or proves to be, plague, the vessel shall be treated as an infected vessel. 22. Any person detained under observation or placed under sur- veillance who is certified by the Port Health Officer or by the medi- cal officer appointed under Regulation 19 to be suffering from plague, or from any illness which such officer suspects may prove to be plague, may be taken to such hospital or ward or observation camp or other suitable place as may be appointed for that purpose by the Sanitary authority of the port or place, and detained there until his recovery, or for such period, not exceeding ten days, as may be necessary for as- certaining whether his illness is, or is not, plague. The said person shall be bound to remain in the place where he is detained and to follow such instructions as the Sanitary authority may prescribe. 23. The Port Health Officer shall, in the case of every vessel cer- tified to be infected or suspected, give directions for the disinfection of all parts of the vessel which have been inhabited by plague-patients, and he may also give such other directions for the more thorough dis- infection of the vessel as may appear to him to be necessary for pre- venting the spread of infection. The master of the said vessel shall forthwith carry into execution all such directions. 24. In the event of any death from plague on board such vessel while detained under these regulations the master shall, as directed by the Sanitary authority, or the Port Health Officer, either cause the dead body to be taken out to sea and committed to the deep properly loaded to prevent its rising, or shall deliver it into the charge of the Sanitary authority for disposal, if the former procedure be not in accordance with caste or race customs. 25. The master shall cause to be destroyed any articles on board his vessel that may have been soiled with plague discharges and he shall also cause to be disinfected or destroyed the clothing and bedding and other articles of personal use likely to retain infection which are on board his vessel and which have been used by any person who has suffered from plague on board such vessel, or who, having left such vessel, shall have suffered from plague during the stay of such vessel in the port. If the master shall have neglected to do so, or have done so ineffectually before the vessel arrives in port, he shall forthwith, upon the direction of the Sanitary authority or the Port Health Officer, cause the same to be disinfected or destroyed to the satisfaction of that authority, and in accordance with the instructions as to disinfection contained in the Appendix to these Regulations. If the said master neglect to comply with any such directions within a reasonable time, the Sanitary authority or the Port Health Officer shall cause the same to be carried into execution at the expense of the said vessel.
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 401 26. Provided facilities exist for obtaining suitable water in the port, the master shall, on the direction of the Port Health Officer, cause all tanks in an infected or suspected vessel to be completely emptied and cleaned and disinfected in such manner as the Port Health Officer may direct and fresh water to be taken in. The Port Health Officer may also, if he thinks necessary, give like directions in the case of a healthy vessel. The master of the vessel shall forthwith carry any such direction into execution. 27. Any mails or cargo which may be brought by any vessel subject to these regulations may be landed under such precautions as the Port Health Officer may deem necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. 28. It will be the duty of the Port Officer to facilitate the con- veyance to all vessels detained under these regulations of such supplies of provisions, stores or other articles as may be required by those on board. Such supplies will be placed on the boats of the vessel to be subsequently removed by the crew. 29. All expenses incurred by any Sanitary authority in carrying out these regulations shall be defrayed from Municipal or District or Taluk Funds in such proportions as the District Collector may, subject to the orders of the Local Government, direct. 30. Any person disobeying or contravening any of the foregoing regulations shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and shall be liable on conviction to be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. No. 103. No. 2091, dated Simla, the 8th September 1897. From-J. P. HEWETT, Esq., C.L.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Madras, Local and Municipal Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your endorsement No. 746-Marine, dated the 23rd August, forwarding a copy of the Notification of the Government of Madras, No. 745-Marine, of the same date, prescribing temporary regulations to be observed in all ports of the Madras Presidency to prevent the introduction of plague. 2. The regulations appear to the Government of India to be gen- erally well adapted for the protection of the ports in the Madras Presidency on the principles laid down in the Venice Sanitary c 51
?402 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. Convention of March 1897. I am to make the following observations with regard to two of the rules:- (i) Rule 15 (3) provides that the healthy persons on board an infected ship shall, if possible, be disembarked for the- purpose of being kept under observation or surveillance, and Rule 15 (4) describes the manner in which the observation should be carried out on shore or on board the vessel. In paragraph 11 of my letter No. 1624, dated the 1st June, stress was laid on the importance of landing the persons from an infected ship instead of detaining them on board. The Government of India understand that Rule 15 (3) is intended to prohibit the detention of healthy persons on board an infected ship, except when, through stress of weather or some other cause, it is absolutely impossible to land them. (ii) Rule 15 (5) authorizes the Port Health Officer to place under observation persons from a healthy or suspected vessel for a term not exceeding ten days from the arrival of the vessel in port. This authorization goes beyond the provisions of the Venice Convention, which limits the medical supervision of the crew and passengers of a healthy ship to ten days from the date of departure from the infected port. The first portion of Rule 15 (5), which deals with the subject of the surveillance of pas- sengers, prescribes the period authorised by the Conven- tion, and the Government of India consider that the second portion of the rule should be modified in the sense of the first portion. The modification could be effected by substituting for the words "for a term not exceeding ten days from such vessels arriving at the port" the words "for the above mentioned terms" or other words to a like effect. No. 104. No. 824-Marine, dated Ootacamund, the 21st September 1897. From-The Secretary to the Government of Madras, Marine Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2091, dated 8th September 1897, communicating certain observations of the Government of India in regard to the temporary regulations issued by the Madras Government to prevent the introduction of plague into the ports of this presidency. 2. In reply I am to say that the interpretation placed by the Gov- ernment of India on Rule 15 (3) is in accordance with the intention
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 403 of the Madras Government. Under the Rule in question, all persons on board an infected vessel are, if possible, to be landed. 3. The proposed amendment of Rule 15 (5) has been adopted, and an erratum, of which I am to enclose a copy herewith, has been issued accordingly. Erratum. In Rule 15 (5) of the temporary regulations to prevent the intro- duction of plague into the ports of the Madras Presidency, and pub- lished in the Fort St. George Gazette of the 31st August 1897, Part I, pages 1117 to 1119- For.-The words "for a term not exceeding ten days from such vessel's arrival at the port." Read " for the above-mentioned terms." BURMA. No. 105. No. 142-3-Z., dated Rangoon, the 8th September 1897. From-F. C. GATES, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Burma, General Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. In compliance with the 12th paragraph of your letter No. 1626, dated the 1st June 1897, I am directed to submit a revised set of quarantine rules for the Port of Rangoon. A new set of rules had been prepared under Act I of 1870 and on the model of the rules formerly promulgated under that Act. But upon receipt of your letter No. 1926, dated the 11th August, it was considered advisable to recast the rules in the form adopted by the Government of Bengal and approved by the Government of India and thus some delay has been caused. 2. A definition of "infected port" has been added to Rule I. In Rule II provision has been entered for the exhibition of quaran- tine lights by vessels arriving at night. In Rules VII (3), VIII (6) and IX (3) provision has been made for disembarking the passengers and members of the crew who are to be kept under observation. The Rules have been verbally altered to the imperative form throughout, and in Rule VII, clauses (4) and (5), and Rule VIII, clauses (3), (4) and (5), the duties have been laid upon specified persons. Except for these alterations and for the necessary substitution of localities the draft now submitted follows the Calcutta rules. 3. The rules have not yet been published, and under present circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor considers it expedient to
?404 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. obtain the approval of them by the Government of India. Upon receipt of telegraphic orders these rules will be published for Rangoon and rules in a similar form, but with the necessary changes in mention of localities, will be published for Moulmein, Akyab and Bassein. The existing quarantine rules at all four ports will then be cancelled by notification under Act I of 1870. General Department. Notification. Dated Rangoon, the September 1897. No. -In exercise of the power conferred by section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and by the notification of the Govern- ment of India in the Home Department. No. 302, dated the 4th Feb- ruary 1897, the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma is pleased to prescribe as a temporary measure, the following rules for quarantine against plague and for the medical inspection, isolation, observation and sur- veillance of persons suffering from, or suspected of being infected with, plague. These rules shall take effect from the day of 1897 in the Port of Rangoon. I.

(2) Infected ship.-Any ship with plague on board, or on which one or more cases have taken place with 12 days before her arrival, will be considered infected. (3) Suspected ship.-Any ship on board which there has been a case of plague at the time of departure, or during the voy- age, but on which no fresh case has occurred for 12 days before her arrival, will be considered suspected. (4) Healthy ship.-Any ship, even though coming from an in- fected port, which has had no death or case of plague on board, either before departure, during the voyage, or on arrival, will be considered healthy. (5) Observation.-The term "observation" means that the per- sons subjected to it will be segregated in a lazaretto or isolation camp till they have obtained free pratique. (6) Surveillance.-The term "surveillance" means that the persons subjected to it will not be isolated : they will at
?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea 405 once obtain free  pratique, but on arriving at their destina- tion they will be kept under medical supervision. (7) Infected port.-Means Bombay or Goa. II Hoisting of yellow flag.-The commander of every vessel, including buggalows or other native craft (a) arriving from an infected port, or (b) having plague on board, or (c) on board of which one or more cases of plague have occurred within 12 days of her arrival, shall, on arrival at the pilot station, hoist a yellow flag or, if the vessel arrives at night, show three lights, red, white and red, at the main, and indi- cate by signal the port from which she has come, and shall keep up such flag by day or lights by night and signal until permitted in writ- ing by the Health Officer to haul them down.

IV. Stoppage at Elephant Point.-If there is any case of sickness on board, and the pilot has reason to believe that it is plague, he shall telegraph to the Health Officer from Elephant Point and not proceed beyond Elephant Point without the permission of the Health Officer. V. Stoppage at the Hastings Shoal.-If the pilot has no reason to believe that there is any one suffering from plague on board, he shall bring the vessel up the river to King's Point below the Hastings Shoal, and shall anchor it there till the Health Officer has visited it. VI. Inspection by Health Officer.-The Health Officer, as soon as he has received information of the stoppage of the vessel at Elephant Point or of its arrival at King's Point below the Hastings Shoal, shall visit it and ascertain by enquiry from the commander or the medical officer on board, or other sources of information, whether any person on board is suffering or has suffered from plague. For this purpose he may demand a declaration, on oath, from the doctor of the ship, or, failing him, from the captain, that there has been no case of plague on the ship since her departure. VII. Rules relating to infected ships- (1) If an infected ship has, under Rule IV, been stopped at Ele- phant Point, the commander shall await the orders of the Health Officer there.

Such period shall not exceed ten days from the date of the last case, whether that occurred on board ship or during the period of observation on shore. The Health Officer may at his discretion allow such persons to proceed to their destination on their giving a written undertaking, in the form of Appendix I, to submit themselves to surveillance by a medical officer appointed for purpose at their destination for a period of ten days from the date of the arrival of the ship. The undertaking shall be executed in duplicate, and one copy shall be sent by the Health Officer to the medical officer concerned.

(5) The bilge-water shall be pumped out by the commander after disinfection by the Health Officer and good drinking water shall be substituted by the commander for the water stored on board. (6) All parts of the ship which have been inhabited by plague- patients shall be disinfected by the Health Officer and the other parts of the ship may also by disinfected at the dis- cretion of the Health Officer. (7) When these rules have been fully complied with the Health Officer shall, by an order in writing under his hand, to be delivered to the commander, permit the yellow flag to be hauled down. VIII. Rules relating to suspected ships- (1) If a suspected ship has under rule IV been stopped at Ele- phant Point, she will await the orders of the Health Officer

(6) Passengers or members of the crew who are suspected by the Health Officer to be infected with plague may be disem- barked and detained under observation at the observation station appointed by Government for ten days from arrival of the ship, or, if plague occurs among them while under observation, from the date of the last case. (7) The rest of the crew shall not land, except on duty, for ten days from the arrival of the ship. (8) Passengers who are passed on medical inspection as healthy shall be allowed to proceed to their destination on their giving a written undertaking, in the form annexed, to sub- mit themselves to surveillance by the medical officer (if any) appointed for the purpose at their destination for a period of ten days from the date of the arrival of the ship.

HEWETT, Esq, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, To-The Secretary to the Government of Burma, General Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 142, dated the 8th instant, forwarding a revised set of draft quarantine rules for the Port of Rangoon, drawn up in accordance with the Venice- Convention and based on the revised rules issued by the Government of Bengal on the 24th August. In the second paragraph of your letter an explanation is given of the points on which the draft rules prepared by the Government of Burma differ from the rules issued by the Gov- ernment of Bengal. 2. I am to say that subject to the following remarks on one of the points mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter the draft rules are approved by the Government of India. In Rule I (7) of the draft rules a definition has been introduced of the term "infected port," which is stated to mean Bombay or Goa. It appears to the Govern- ment of India to be hardly necessary to introduce a definition of the term "infected port" since the Local Government could at any time issue instruction to its officers stating the ports that should be treated as infected. If, however, the Government of Burma prefer to retain a defi- nition of the term, then it appears to the Government of India that the definition should be one of general application, and that it should not be limited to meet the circumstances of the existing case. They could suggest that the definition might be altered to the following :- "Infected port.-Means any port which the Government of Burma may declare to be infected." 3. The second Appendix to the draft rules contains a set of ins- tructions for disinfection which are taken from Chapter III of the Venice Convention. I am to invite attention to the memorandum from this office No. 1979, dated the 20th August, forwarding a copy of alterations to be made in the translation of the convention which formed an enclosure to my letter No. 1626, dated the 1st June. These alterations have not been made in the copy of Appendix II of the draft rules forwarded c 52

?APP. IX.] spread of infection by sea. 411 voyage, but on which no fresh case has occurred for 12 days before her arrival, will be considered suspected. (4) Healthy ship.-Any ship, even though coming from an infect- ed port, which has had no death or case of plague on board, either before departure, during the voyage, or on arrival will be considered healthy.

Stoppage at Elephant Point.-If there is any case of sickness on board, and the pilot has reason to believe that it is plague, he shall telegraph to the Health Officer from Elephant Point and not proceed beyond Elephant Point without the permission of the Health Officer V. Stoppage at the Hastings Shoal.-If the pilot has no reason to believe that there is any one suffering from plague on board, he shall bring the vessel up the river to King's Point below the Hastings Shoal, and shall anchor it there till the Health Officer has visited it.
?412 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. VI. Inspection by Health Officer.-The Health Officer, as soon as he has received information of the stoppage of the vessel at Elephant Point or of its arrival at King's Point below the Hastings Shoal, shall visit it and ascertain by enquiry from the Commander or the Medical Officer on board, or other sources of information, whether any person on board is suffering or has suffered from plague. For this purpose he may demand a declaration, on oath, from the Doctor of the ship, or failing him, from the Captain, that there has been no case of plague on the ship since her departure. VII.

I (name) of (place) do hereby declare that it is my intention at once to proceed to (place), and agree to submit myself to medical supervi- sion by (name or office of Medical Officer appointed for the purpose) for a period of ten days from (date from which period is to be reckoned). Signed In the presence of Health Officer. APPENDIX II. Instruction for disinfection. 1. Personal effects, rags, infected bandages, papers, and other articles without value should be destroyed by fire. 2. Under-clothing, bedding, wearing apparel, mattresses, carpets, &c., which are contaminated or suspected, should be disinfected in stoves at normal pressure or at a pressure of from one and-a-half to two degrees, with or without the presence of steam. Before a stove is passed as efficient for the purposes of disinfection, it should be subjected to a test, with the aid of a signal thermometer,- showing the moment when the temperature in the middle of a mattress rises to at least 100 (centigrade). To ensure that the disinfection is effective, this temperature must be maintained for from 10 to 15 minutes.
?416 Measures to prevent the [APP. IX. 3. Disinfecting solutions.-(a) Solution of corrosive sublimate of I part in 1,000, with the addition of 10 parts of chloride of soda. The solution should be coloured with aniline dye or indigo. It should not be placed in metal vessels. (b) A 5 per cent. solution of pure crystalized carbolic acid, or 5 per cent. of crude commercial carbolic acid in a warm solution of soft soap. (c) Fresh slaked lime.* 4. Special instructions to be observed in the employment of dis- infecting solutions.-The linen, clothing, and articles soiled by the excreta of patients should be soaked in the solution of corrosive subli- mate. The solution of pure carbolic acid and the solution of soap and carbolic acid are equally suited to the purpose. The articles should remain in the solution for at least six hours. Articles which cannot be subjected to the temperature of the stove (100 centigrade) without injury, such as leather goods, woollen articles stuck together with glue, felt, velvet, silk, &c., should be washed with the solution of corrosive sublimate; coins can be disinfected with the solution of soap and carbolic acid. Persons engaged in nursing the sick should wash their hands and   faces with the solution of corrosive sublimate, or with one of the carbolic solutions. The carbolic solutions will be useful more particularly for disinfect- ing articles such as metals, instruments, &c., which can neither be subjected to a temperature of 100 centigrade, nor placed in contact with corrosive sublimate. Slaked lime is particularly recommended for disinfecting excreta. Expectorated matter should be burnt. 5. Disinfection of ships with plague-patients on board.-The cabin or cabins and all parts of the ship occupied by the sick or sus- pected should be cleared out, and all articles in them should be treated as described above. The partitions should be disinfected with the solution of corrosive sublimate with an addition of 10 per cent. of alcohol. The washing should commence from the top, horizontally, and be continued down- wards, so that the whole surface of the partition becomes covered with a coating of minute drops. * To get very strong slaked lime take lime of good quality, slake it, by moistening it gradually with half its weight of water. When the operation is completed, put the powder in a carefully-corked receptacle and place it in a dry spot. As each kilogramme of lime absorbs 500 grammes of water in order to become slack, it acquires a volume of 2 litres 200 and it is sufficient to dilate it with double its volume of water, say, 4 kilo- grammes 400 grammes to obtain a whitewash which will be of about 20 per cent, strength of lime.
APP. IX. ] spread of infection by sea. 417 The boarding should be washed with the same solution. Two hours after, the walls and flooring should be washed over with plenty of water. 6. Disinfection of the hold of an infected ship.-To disinfect the hold sulphate of iron, in quantity sufficient to neutralize the sulphurated hydrogen, should first be thrown in, the bilge-water should then be pumped out, and the hold washed with sea-water. Solution of corro- sive sublimate should then be thrown in. The bilge-water should not be pumped out while the ship is in port. No. 211, dated Rangoon, the 7th October 1897.

From-The Chief Secretary to the Government of Punjab, To-The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Large amount grain daily imported from Sind and particularly Sukkur: non-imported cases of plague reported in Sukkur: if it gets worse, question will arise whether importation of grain should be stopped or grain detained en route till bacilli die. Do expert advisers of Government of India consider any such measure really necessary? Effect would be very serious not merely as directly affecting importa- tion but by creating apprehension of further restrictions which would send up prices.

Punjab Government has raised question whether import of grain into Punjab from Sind or Sukkur should be prohibited. Government of India have replied that it would be very serious matter to prohibit import and that the trade does not add sufficiently to danger of spread of infection to make it necessary to incur evils that would result from stopping it. But Government of India consider that all possible pre- cautions should be taken to prevent contaminated grain being exported from Sind. In especial measures should be adopted to obtain imme- diate information of any plague cases in or near grain godowns and to prevent removal of grain open to suspicion of contamination. Govern- ment of India will be glad to learn means adopted with view to above ends. Please also report specially occurrence of plague cases affecting grain or other export industries in Sind. No. 9.

Punjab Government has raised question whether import of grain into Punjab from Sind or Sukkur should be prohibited in view of indi- genous cases having occurred at Sukkur and in Sind. Government of India have replied that it would be very serious matter to prohibit import and that the trade does not add sufficiently to danger of spread of infection to make it necessary to incur evils that would result from stopping it.

?426 Measures to prevent the spread of [APP. X. No. 394, dated the 17th March 1897. From-The Civil Surgeon, Sukkur, To-The Commissioner in Sind. In continuation of my letter No. 341, dated 11th instant, I have the honour to state that for the week ending 15th March 1897 fifteen fresh cases of plague have occurred, making a total of 29 from the beginning of the outbreak, of which 22 have proved fatal and 7 are under treatment at the Contagious Landhies. 2. Of the 15 fresh cases, there is distinct evidence that 13 either had communication with, or resided in, the infected area mentioned in my last weekly report; of the remaining 2 cases, no reliable in- formation could be obtained from one, as the patient was found migrating to a village on foot, and, when arrested by the police, was semi-delirious, the other case showing no direct signs of infection, beyond the fact that two cases had previously occurred in his neigh- bourhood. 3. The following few facts may prove interesting in proving how the disease, once localised, infects the neighbourhood. When the disease first began to establish itself in Sukkar, it was reported by the Sanitary Inspector that several dead rats were fre- quently being found outside a Hindu temple, and to which there was a well adjoining, at the entrance of Gunga Lane, where the disease first took root. I investigated the place several times, and though I saw several rats in the act of drinking water from the drain which communicates with this sacred well, I never witnessed any of them dying or dead, as the Sanitary Inspector assured me he had seen them come out and drink, and while in the act of drinking get con- vulsed and die. I interviewed the Head Fakir on each occasion, and as there was a godown in which grain was stored just behind this temple, I was led to believe that the rats found their way to this well from the godown. However, I reported the matter to the Collector on the 4th instant, immediately on his arrival in Sukkur, and it was arranged to force open the godown that evening (as the owners had deserted), with the result that beyond a certain amount of ordinary accumulation of dust, the godown was found practically clean and free from all insanitary defects. About five days subsequent to this it was reported that this Head Fakir had deserted to a village about 10 miles out of Sukkur and died suddenly the day after his arrival there; this naturally excited suspicion and the temple was closely watched. On the morning of the 11th, it was reported to me, sub rosa, that a man was lying ill in this very temple. I accordingly forced my way in and found such to be the case. I met with some opposi- tion, but was able to force my way into every room and found 2 men
?APP. X.] infection by merchandise and food-stuffs. 427 concealed in different rooms, one plague-stricken, and the other, who was evidently the next representative of the temple, concealing himself through fright, but apparently in good health. I had the two plague cases at once removed to the Contagious Landhi, and the other man to the Health Camp; a fourth man had in the meantime escaped, but he was found two days after and removed in a critical condition to the Contagious Landhi. I then drove off to the Collector and he very kindly returned with me and, at my suggestion, ordered the whole building to be destroyed and burnt, and the well to be closed, after having the value properly assessed. The three patients removed to the Contagious Landhi died as well as the headman who was sent to the Health Camp, and in the course of demolishing the building, no fewer than 35 dead rats were removed, so that the whole of the 5 inmates, including the man who died in the village outside of Sukkur, were exterminated within 10 days. The conclusion one is apt to draw from this is that the infection prob- ably first began in this temple and that it was a perfect hotbed of infection, as all the Hindus from Gunga Lane and other lanes in the neighbourhood were in the habit of congregating and worshipping in this temple, but that they managed to conceal the danger from us until suspicions were aroused by the Head Fakir's death, and it is now evident that these rats were being poisoned from the neighbour- hood of the temple and not from the adjoining grain godown to which our suspicions first pointed. No. 1267, dated Hyderabad, the 18th March 1897. From-C. G. DODGSON, Esq., Collector of Hyderabad, To-The Commissioner in Sind. In reply to your endorsement No. 1297, dated 17th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I do not think that grain export should be stopped. I know of no cases of plague near grain godowns, but I will keep a sharp lookout. No. 1016, dated Jacobabad, the 19th-21st March 1897. From-H. C. MULES, Esq., Deputy Commissioner, Upper Sind Frontier, To-The Commissioner in Sind. Precautions tobe taken to pre- vent contaminated grain being exported from Sind. In reply to your No. 1297 of the 17th March 1897, I have the honour to state that with the exception of one imported case from Sukkur, which was quarantined on arrival and isolated when the disease developed, no case of plague has occurred at Jacobabad or in the Upper Sind Frontier District. Consequently there appears to be no reason, so far as fear of possible infection is concerned, for prohibiting the export of grain.
?428 Measures to prevent the spread of [APP. X. 3. Should plague make its appearance, the instructions contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of your letter will be followed. No. 2080, dated Sukkur, the 22nd-23rd March 1897. From-COLONEL ALFRED MAYHEW, Collector of Shikarpur, To-The Commissioner in Sind. With reference to your endorsement No. 1297 of the 17th instant, I have the honour to report that there are godowns of grain situated in the infected area of Sukkur, viz., in Gunga Lane, Miani Road, Fakir Street. Orders have been issued prohibiting export of grain from these godowns. 2. As these godowns are being cleaned and lime whitewashed, they will be examined with a view to find if any dead rats are there. No. 2117, dated Karachi, the 18th March 1897. Endorsed by-R. GILES, Esq., Collector of Karachi. Forwarded for immediate report to the Mukhtiarkar of Karachi, who is requested to state whether the number of grain godowns is very large, and whether he could carry out the enquiry or if it would be necessary to appoint a special officer. 2. The information required is- (1) Whether plague cases have occurred in or near grain godowns. (2) Whether any grain open to suspicion has been removed or is detained by orders. 3. The Collector is asking all Superintendents to report at once any case where plague has occurred near a grain godown and to stop the removal of the grain in such a case, pending further orders. No. 235, dated Karachi, the 23rd March 1897. From-FRAMROZE E. PANTHKEY, Mukhtiarkar of Karachi, To-The Collector of Karachi. With reference to your endorsement No. 2117, dated 18th March last, on the subject of the inspection of the grain godowns, I beg to state that it is very difficult to give a correct idea of the number of grain godowns now existing in Karachi. Even the most experienced and well-informed merchants as well as brokers are not in a position to do so owing to people having gone away and closed their godowns. But from my personal observation and experience as well as from enquiries instituted from merchants and others, I find that there are at present only 60 to 70 godowns out of about 200 existing before the plague, with stock in them; the rest are all empty. These are the godowns where grains are stored for exportation purposes; but besides these there is a larger number of smaller godowns, where shopkeepers
?APP. X.] infection by merchandise and food-stuffs. 429 have stocked their supplies for local consumption. Such godowns will number about 500 to 600, for with every shop in the town there is a small godown attached either in the shop or somewhere adjacent; but even many of these godowns are closed and empty. Godowns of both denominations are scattered about in all the localities of the town. Some of these godowns are near or adjacent to infected houses, and in some, cases of plague have occurred; but correct information on this point can be obtained from the Superintendents. If it is intended to examine the few big godowns where grain for exportation is kept, I shall probably be able to carry out the inspection with an additional staff, but shall not be able to devote my whole time with grains so stored; but if it is intended to examine all the godowns, big or small export or otherwise, it would not be possible for me, in addition to my present duty, to carry out the work; in that case it will be desirable to appoint a special officer, who can devote more time on this work. Grains from godowns close to infected houses have been exported. At present no grain is exported from Karachi to Punjab. In December last about 3,000 bags were exported by three native mer- chants to the Punjab. Grain from Karachi is now chiefly exported to Bhaunaggar, Vira- wal, Bombay, Makran and Lus. No. 2353, dated Karachi, 25th March 1897. Memo. by-R. GILES, Esq., Collector of Karachi. True copies submitted to the Commissioner in Sind in reply to his endorsement No. 1297, dated the 17th instant. The Collector also called for reports from the Superintendents in charge of the City Quarters. 2. Five samples of grain sent by Mr. Cadell from a grain shop in the market quarter, from the places on which dead rats were lying, are also forwarded. The rats had apparently been dead for more than a month and were dried up. 3. Mr. Gloster reported that "in all cases where dead rats are found in or near grain and in cases of plague occurring in close prox- imity to a flour mill or grain store, he destroyed the loose grain and grain in open bags, transferring grain in closed bags to new bags and disinfecting the old ones." 4. He asks orders regarding a considerable quantity of such grain which is under detention, and whether it should be handed over to the owners. 5. Mr. Cadell has also burnt loose grain, where dead rats were found, and all old bags, new ones being put in the sun and disin- fected.
?430 Measures to prevent the spread of [APP. X. 6. His third paragraph runs as follows:- "I think this is all that can be done, for the following reason. Most of the big grain godowns have been cleared, not by us, but by the owners. This has been necessary, both because the latter have the right to do so, and because the labour of cleaning such big go- downs would be so great that the Municipality would not be justified in undertaking it, unless absolutely obliged to do so. Now, we can- not exercise supervision over all the private godowns, nor know how many dead rats are found therein. All we can do, as has invariably been done, is to see that the owner has cleaned his godown, burning all the loose grain before we pass it." 7. The above information will show the Commissioner that in order to deal efficiently, an intelligent officer must be appointed with a con- siderable staff under him. Small godowns would, as a rule, be more dangerous than large ones, and the number of small ones is very large. 8. The Collector at once directed the Superintendents to detain grain in any godown where plague had occurred or dead rats been found, and instructions regarding grain so detained are requested.

Collector of Karachi's No. 2353, dated the 25th March 1897. I venture to append copies of the correspondence noted in the margin regarding plague in grain godowns, as I think that your Committee might detail a Military Officer with a party of men to make a thorough inspection of the godowns under rules which your Committee could prescribe. Several bakers seem to have been attacked
?APP. X.] infection by merchandise and food-stuffs. 431 by plague. This is not unnatural, because rats go to grain and being infected die there, and so grain godowns and bakers' shops become infected. The grain or flour near or on which any rat is found may, please, be carefully collected and marked, and it will be sent to Bombay for examination by experts. I would also venture to suggest that the officer detailed to this duty should arrange for daily inspection of all bakeries and persons employed therein. Note by the Commissioner in Sind. General Cooke has informed me that a party is being detailed as requested. No. 1529, dated Karachi, the 29th March 1897. Endorsed by-A. WINGATE, Esq., C I.E., I.C.S., Acting Commissioner in Sind.

The rats had apparently been dead for more than a month and were dried up.

HANKIN, Esq., M.A., Chemical Examiner and Bacteriologist, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, No. 15. To-The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Revenue Department. In reply to your No. 6587, dated 15th April 1897, I have the honour to state that I have received five samples of grain sent by the Commissioner in Sind for examination as to the presence of the bubo- nic microbe. 2. Extracts of each of these specimens were injected into mice. One specimen contained a piece of the skin of a dead rat. This was separately extracted and injected into a mouse. Three of the mice have survived. Two died of malignant cedema, and the last died without showing any sign of microbic infection. In no case was any appearance of the presence of the bubonic microbe met with. I note that in the case of the grain on which dead rats were lying, it is stated they appeared to have been dead for more than a month. So far as my knowledge of the bubonic microbe goes, it is not likely that it would survive in a rat for so long a period.

?436 Regulations against arrivals from India [ App. XI. Date of Regulation. Purport of Regulation.  EUROPE.  (I) UNITED KINGDOM. November 9th, 1896. Arrivals from Indian infected ports were treated under the " General Regulations as to Cholera, Yellow Fever and Plague " issued by the Local Gov- ernment Board on the 9th November 1896. The following is the purport of these Regulations : -   The customs-officer shall visit the ship, and if he suspects that the ship is infected or has come from an infected place, he shall require the master or surgeon to state whether there has been any case or suspected case of plague, etc., on board. If he finds or has reason to suspect that the ship is infected, he shall detain the ship and inform the sanitary authority of the port.  Sanitary authorities of ports shall fix moorings for infected ships and make provision for the re- ception of persons suffering from plague, etc. On receiving notice from the customs-officer the sani- tary authority shall cause the ship to be inspected by the Medical Officer of Health. The Medical Officer of Health may also examine any ship which he has reason to suspect to be infected or to come from an infected port. The detention by the cus- toms-officer shall cease as soon as the vessel has been examined by the medical officer, or if the ship is infected, as soon as she is anchored at the mooring appointed for infected ships.  If the medical officer finds the ship to be infected, he shall give a certificate to that effect, and the master shall then moor the ship at the appointed anchorage. No one shall then leave the ship until the detailed examination is completed. The medical officer shall examine every person on board, and if he finds or suspects any one to be suffering from plague, etc., shall give a certificate to that effect with respect to such person. Any person certi- fied to be suffering from plague, etc., shall, if his condition admit of it, be removed to a hospital or other suitable place appointed for the * The dates are in many instances only approximate,

If he cannot be removed, the ship shall remain subject to the control of the medical officer. and the person shall be detained on board until the medical officer grants permission for his disembar- kation. Any person certified to be suffering from ill- ness which may be plague, etc., shall be detained on board or on shore for two days, and if found to be suffering from plague, etc., shall be treated in the manner stated above, No other person shall be allowed to land from the ship until he has satisfied the medical officer as to his name, intended place of destination and intended address. These par- ticulars shall be communicated to the local authority of the place in which the intended destination is situated. Any person thus permitted to land who within forty-eight hours after landing arrives at any address other than that communicated to the medi- cal officer shall immediately report his address to the local authorities.  The medical officer shall give such other directions and take such other steps as may appear to him to be necessary to prevent the spread of infection from the ship. If any death from plague, etc., occurs on board whilst the ship is detained, the body shall be disposed of according to the prescribed directions. The clothing, bedding and other articles of personal use likely to retain infection belonging to sufferers from plague, etc., shall be disinfected or destroyed. The master shall cause the ship to be disinfected, and articles that may probably be infected (other than those mentioned above) to be disinfected or destroyed.  When a ship which is not infected has passengers on board who are in a filthy or otherwise unwhole- some condition, or has come from an infected place, the medical officer may give a certificate stating these facts. The rules regarding passengers from an infected ship shall then apply to the vessel thus certified.  The medical officer may direct the bilge-water and water ballast of infected vessels or vessels from

On the sanitary authority providing a proper supply of water for drinking and cooking, the medical offi- cer may direct all casks and tanks containing such water to be emptied and cleaned.  (2) FRANCE (AND ALGERIA). January 4th, 1897, On this date the French Government issued a de- cree prescribing a set of general regulations to pre- vent the infection of exotic epidemic diseases being imported into the French ports.

Seen the Law of 22nd December 1888, No. 5849 (3rd series), for the protection of hygiene and public health. The Minister of the Interior decrees: In cases when the owners or masters of steamers coming from Indian ports specified in the Maritime Sanitary Ordinance of the 1st May last, and bound for Italy, make a formal application to that effect, a doctor, to be appointed in each case by this Ministry, can be embarked on such steamers at Port Said.

La Convention n'impose pas la prohibition absolue des marchan- dises qui sont considres comme suspects. Elle reconnait la facult de les soumettre  des dfenses d'importation et de transit ou  la dsinfection. Usant de cette facult je propose de prohiber les marchandises et objets suivants, sauf des drogations, autorises par dcisions, motives, et moyennant de prescrire des prcautions spciales d'em- ballage, de dsinfection, ou autres:- 1.

Quant aux bagages, qu'ils accompagnent ou non le voyageur, la dsinfection sera obligatoire pour le linge sale, les hardes, vtements, et objets qui font partie de bagages ou de mobiliers (effets d'installa- tion) provenant d'une circonscription territoriale dclare contamine et que l'autorit sanitaire considrera comme contamins. Il convient de remarquer, qu'en dehors des prohibitions imposes, l'autorit sanitaire du port a le droit de soumettre  la dsinfection tous les autres objets qu'elle rangerait dans cette catgorie; ainsi, il est de nombreux petits objets, des chantillons, des bibelots que les matelots ou les passagers introduisent avec leurs bagages, et qu'ils revendent  l'arrive du navire. Ces objets ne proviennent pas de grands ateliers o le danger de contamination n'existe gure, mais ont pu tre achets dans des habitations peut-tre infectes. Enfin, un Article du projet d'Arrt donne au Ministre de l'Agri- culture et des Travaux Publics le pouvoir de dsigner les pays ou les parties de pays  l'gard desquels rgime prvu sera rendu applicable et de rgler la mise  excution et la dure des measures prescrites.

Navires Suspects.-Les navires suspects sont ceux  bord desquels il y a eu des cas de peste au moment du dpart ou pendant la traverse mais aucun cas nouveau depuis douze jours. Ces navires seront traits d'une faon diffrente, suivant qu'ils ont ou n'ont pas  bord un mdecin et une tuve  dsinfection. (a) Les navires ayant un mdecin et une tuve  dsinfection remplissant les conditions voulues seront admis  passer le Canal de Suez en quarantaine dans les conditions du Rglement pour le transit. (b) Les navires n'ayant ni mdecin ni tuve  dsinfection, seront, avant d'tre admis  transiter en quarantaine, retenus  la station Sanitaire pendant le temps ncessaire pour oprer la dsinfection du linge sale, du linge de corps, et autres objets susceptibles, et pour s'assurer de l'tat sanitaire du navire.

Leur linge sale, linge de corps, effets  usage (vtements), et autres objets susceptibles seront dsinfects. (Voir Chapitre "Dsinfection.") Ils recevront alors la libre pratique. Les navires qui ont un trajet indemne de moins de quatorze jours plein et qui demandent la libre pratique en gypte seront galement retenus  la station Sanitaire pendant le temps ncessaire pour complter dix jours. Le navire, le linge sale, le linge de corps, et les effets  usage (vtements) de l'quipage, ainsi que les marchan- dises susceptibles, seront dsinfects. (Voir Chapitre "Dsinfec- tion.")

(a) Les navires sans mdecin et sans appareil  dsinfection (tuve) seront arrts aux Sources de Mose, les personnes atteintes de peste dbarques et isoles dans un hpital. La dsinfection sera pratique d'une faon complte. Les autres passagers seront dbarqus et isols par groupes aussi peu nombreux que possible, de manire que l'ensemble ne soit pas solidaire d'un groupe particulier si la peste venait  se dvelopper. Le linge sale, les objets  usage, les vtements de l'quipage et des passagers seront dsin- fects, ainsi que le navire. Il est bien entendu qu'il ne s'agit pas du dchargement des mar- chandises mais seulement de la dsinfection de la partie du navire qui a t infecte. Les passagers resteront dix jours  l'tablissement des Sources de Mose; lorsque les cas de peste remonteront  plusieurs jours, la dure de l'isolement sera diminue. Cette dure variera suivant l'poque de l'apparition du dernier cas. Ainsi, lorsque le dernier cas se sera produit depuis neuf, dix, ou douze jours, la dure de l'observation sera de vingt-quatre heures; s'il s'est produit depuis huit jours, l'observation sera de deux jours;

Aprs le dbarquement de ces malades, le linge sale du reste des passagers et de l'quipage subira la dsinfection  bord. Lorsque la peste se sera montre exclusivement dans l'quipage, la dsinfection du linge ne portera que sur le linge sale de l'quipage et le linge des postes de l'quipage. Le mdecin du bord indiquera aussi, sous serment, la partie ou le compartiment du navire et la section de l'hpital dans lesquels le ou les malades auront t transports. Il dclarera galement sous serment quelles sont les personnes qui ont t en rapport avec le pestifr depuis la premire manifestation de la maladie, soit par des contacts directs, soit par des contacts avec des objets capables de transmettre l'infection. Ces personnes seule- ment seront considres comme suspectes. La partie ou le compartiment du navire et la section de l'hpital dans lesquels le ou les malades auront t transports, seront com- pltement dsinfects. On entend par " partie du navire," la cabine du malade, les cabines attenantes, le couloir de ces cabines, le pont, les parties du pont sur lesquelles le ou les malades auraient sjourn. S'il est impossible de dsinfecter la partie ou le compartiment du navire qui a t occup par les personnes atteintes de peste, sans dbarquer les personnes dclares suspectes, ces personnes seront places sur un autre navire spcialement affect  cet usage ou dbarques et loges dans l'tablissement Sanitaire sans contact avec les malades, lesquels seront placs dans l'hpital. La dure de ce sjour sur le navire ou  terre pour la dsinfection sera aussi courte que possible et n'excdera pas vingt-quartre heures.

APPENDIX XII. THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA. Suspension of the Pilgrimage. No. 1. Government of India, Home Department, Notification No. 66, dated the 21st January 1897. It is notified for general information that the Government of Bom- bay have, in consequence of the existence of bubonic plague in the cities of Bombay and Karachi, temporarily cancelled, with effect from the 1st February 1897, the orders appointing these places to be ports under section 701 of the Pilgrim Ships Act, XIV of 1895, from which pilgrim ships may depart or proceed, and at which they may discharge pilgrims. The ports of Calcutta and Madras remain open to pilgrim traffic. No. 2 Government of India, Home Department, Notification No. 507, dated the 16th February 1897. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 2, sub-section 1 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the Governor General in Council is pleased to direct that no person resident permanently or temporarily in the Bombay Presidency or Sind, and no person who, though not resident in the Bombay Presidency or Sind, has entered the Bombay Presidency or Sind with the object of proceeding on a pilgrimage to the Hedjaz shall, until further orders, be permitted to embark on any ship at any port in British India with the object of making a pilgrim- age to the Hedjaz. The Governor General in Council is further pleased to direct that all persons who have entered the Bombay Presidency or Sind with the object of proceeding to the Hedjaz shall be placed in a camp of obser- vation until such time as the medical officer in charge shall satisfy himself that all risk of the occurrence of plague among them has been completely abated.

490 The pilgrimage to Mecca. [APP. XII. No.3. Government of India, Home Department, Notification No. 625, dated the 20th  February 1897. The question of the suspension of the pilgrimage to the Hedjaz having been under the consideration of the Government of India and Her Majesty's Government, Her Majesty's Government have now come to the conclusion that, in consequence of the strong opinions of all European Governments, including Turkey, regarding the danger of plague being communicated to Europe, it is impossible to meet their demands by any measure short of the suspension of the pilgrimage for the time being. The Governor General in Council is therefore pleased, under section 2, sub-section 1 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to order that the pilgrimage to the Hedjaz shall be altogether suspended for the current season. Return of Pilgrims from Mecca. No. 4. Government of Bombay, Notification No. 3118-A., dated the 5th June 1897. Whereas the City of Bombay is visited by an attack of a danger- ous epidemic disease, namely, Bubonic Plague, and whereas it is necessary to prevent the spread of such disease, and whereas the Governor in Council thinks that the ordinary provisions of the law for the time being in force are insufficient for the purpose, he is pleased, under the powers conferred upon him by the Governor General in Council under Act III of 1897, to make the following temporary regulations to be observed by the public and by all persons whom they may concern:- 1. The master of every vessel, including buggalows and every kind of native craft, arriving at the port of Bombay with Muhammadan pilgrims from Mecca and ports in the Red Sea shall report the same at the earliest possible moment to the Health Officer of the Port through the Pilot or Water Police or other boarding officer. 2. The master shall anchor his vessel in the stream and shall not permit the departure or landing of any of his crew or passengers until permitted so to do by the Health Officer of the Port or the Commissioner of Police, Bombay. 3. All Muhammadan pilgrims arriving by any such vessel as aforesaid shall on demand give their names and addresses and mention their intentions regarding future movements to the Health Officer of the Port and the Water Police or other Police authority requiring such information.
