No. 3021 Genl., dated Lahore, 14th April 1915. From-Colonel C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, To -The Additional Secretary to Government, Punjab. I HAVE the honour to forward, herewith, the annual report of the Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab, on the work done by the Malaria Bureau and to state as follows. 2. Owing to the reversion to Military duty of Captain Gill, I.M.S., the appointment of Chief Malaria Medical Officer has been held by Lieutenant- Colonel Lane, I.M.S., since 4th November last in addition to his appointment as Chief Plague Medical Officer. During a part of the summer and the autumn, the energies of the malaria staff had been devoted to the survey of Lahore in particular as also to the attempt to protect school children against malaria. As regards the latter, the effort did not prove altogether successful owing to the vacations which hampered its being carried out effectually. The spleen census which has been made has provided information on the subject which will be undoubt- edly useful in the future. A large portion of the work of the malaria staff has been dealt with in separate reports on the spleen census and quinine pro- phylactics among school boys. 3. In his report Lieutenant-Colonel Lane confines his attention chiefly to what he has had to do himself and has taken the opportunity to endeavour to give some practical advice for the prevention of malaria and this is required as pointed out last year. What is required is practical advice which will show how to prevent the disease as also the institution of scientific enquiries into its incidence and causes. On this financial assistance is more likely to be given by local bodies towards the prosecution of measures for the prevention of Malaria. I would ask for 160 copies of the report when printed for circulation in this department. No 73 M. I., dated Lahore, 29th March 1915. From-Lieutenant-Colonel D. T. LANE, M.D., D.P.H., I.M.S., Chief Malaria Medical Officer, Punjab, To-The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab. I HAVE the honour to submit this annual report on the work done in the Malaria Bureau during the year, also suggestions for the prevention of malaria in certain places, and tables and charts showing the fever death rate and other matters concerning malaria in the Punjab. 2. Captain Gill, I.M.S., has written a very able and interesting "Report on Malaria in the Punjab, with special reference to its prevalence among school children." This report has already been forwarded to the Punjab Government for perusal and publication. Malaria surveys of Amritsar city; Gujrt, Batla and Thnesar towns have been carried out and a preliminary survery of Lahore is approaching completion. As the malaria survey of Lahore has been carried out under me, I will confine my remarks to that city. No large or expensive scheme, so far as my observations go, is required for the prevention, of malaria in Lahore. A copy of the survey will soon be in the hands of the municipal com- mittee, and I have no doubt the commit ee will carry out the measures which will be recommended for the prevention of malaria. Along the sides of the railways from Lahore City to Lahore Cantonments, the ground is cut up in all directions and rank vegetation shelters inumer- able pools On the Shahdara side areas of considerable size are under water in the rains, and there are some large borrow-pits on the side of the line near the city. There is a chain of pools along the sides of practically all the roads approaching Lahore. The condition along the sides of the railways and roads near Lahore is not all exceptional it is the same throughout the Punjab. Pools on the road-sides are very dangerous, as people frequently sleep on the road-sides and are apt to contract malaria. I do not think I am far wrong in saving that so surely as a man sleeps a night on the side of the road between Chandigarh and the Ghaggar in September so surely will he contract malaria. Pools near railway stations are very dangerous, as people frequently sleep in the Railway Stations at night. 1 suggest that pools and puddles along road-sides and railway sides be either filled up or drained. There is a lot of waste land along the roads and railways which instead of being, as it is now, a danger to the public, might be brought under cultivation or utilized in some way. A rose garden along the railways from Lahore to Min Mr would probably return a handsome profit. It may be worth while for Gov-
?2 e\ill\ment to obtain the opinion of an experienced Settlement Officer as to the possibility of put- ting the land along roads and railways to some useful purpose. In Lahore, as in most places, we have, I am afraid, been very careless about closing up or draining borrow-pits we have excavated. A line of pools between the fort and the wireless station in which anopheline larv have been found the whole year round, is, I am informed, the remains of the water-course to the Industrial Exhibition we had in Lahore a few years ago, observations were conducted in the Shalimar garden tanks with the object of ascertaining the utility or otherwise of certain fish in destroying the anopheline larv, but no definite conclusion was arrived at. 3. The advisability of administering quinine to school children during the malaria season for the twofold purpose of preventing malaria and instructing the children in the use of quinine has been under consideration. In Ambla the only difficulty I experienced was, that the children were on vacation about half the malarial season. If quinine is to be administered regularly during the malaria season, the time of vacation must be altered. Outside educating the children in the use of quinine I should like also to have exhibited in a specimen tube in each school the malaria carrying mosquitoes of the Punjab. My staff could mount the mos- quitoes, so the cost would be small, 4. A lot of malaria is contracted in dk bungalows and rest-houses, Little or no attempt is made to see after the sanitation of these houses. The chaukidar or man in charge takes no action to prevent anopheline breeding places in the compound. Water in some in- stances lies for days (between the going of visitor and the coming of another) undisturbed in the garahs in the bath rooms. In some instances even the poisonous three garah-filter is found in the verandah, and if the building is a Government one, a line of red fire buckets half filled with water and mosquito larv-the variety depending usually on the season of the year. Coupled with all this about 50 per cent, of the servants' children only a few yards away have usually got enlarged spleens. 5. The prevention of malaria in the canal colonies has been under consideration. It is practically impossible to compare the fever death-rate in the canal colonies with the fever death-rate in pre-colonial times for in large areas now populated, there was practically no popu- lation at all. The conditions in canal colonies are unfavourable to malaria, in so far as the people are well fed and have consequently a high resisting power. A well-nourished man may contract malaria, but he very rarely dies of it. The conditions in the canal colonies, if irriga- tion is not carefully carried out, are favourable to malaria in so far as they afford innumer- able potential breeding places for anopheline mosquitoes. The disease at any rate requires to be carefully watched and all reasonable precautions should be taken for its prevention, with the object of watching the disease more carefully I suggest that in addition to the death reports now submitted, Civil Surgeons be asked to send a report of the deaths from fever in the villages in the canal colonies to the Chief Malaria Medical Officer so that the fever mortality could be specially examined and in the event of an unusual death-rate from fever in any village an officer of the Malaria Bureau who has had special training in malarial matters could be deputed to advise and assist the local staff. I would also suggest education of the colonists in malarial matters by leaflets and other means. The very great importance of taking quinine themselves and of giving quinine free of charge to all their workmen and the families of their workmen during the months of August, September and October should be impressed on all colonial land owners. The dose given by the Punjab Government to petty officials, menials and convicts, 15 grs. a week, is simple and effective. One pound of quinine which can be purchased for about Rs. 12 is capable of protecting from malaria 40 workmen- for a whole year-annas five per head per annum. It is not a very great task for an employer of labour to give 15 grs. of quinine to his servants once a week, for three months. 6.

Bawa Harnam Singh, Senior Assistant, Malaria Bureau, and Pandit Daulat Ram, have been of the greatest assistance to me. They are energetic and capable. The other mem- bers of the staff also worked to my entire satisfaction,
