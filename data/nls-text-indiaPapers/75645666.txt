Address:Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in Ajmer-Merwara (British Rajputana) for the year 1922-23. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G.

He was on tour in Ajmer-Merwara for 12 days and travelled 1,892 miles by rail and 39 miles by road. I.2 Other Diseases. Table IV. 13. The number of villages visited by the Veterinary Assistants during the year was 78 against 146 in the pre- vious year.

The number of cases treated was 2,166 as against 1,570 in the previous year. Medicines and advice were given to the owners of 256 animals not brought to the dispensary. 15.

Government of India Publications are obtainable from the Government of India Central Publication Branch, 8, Hastings Street, Calcutta, and from the following Agents:Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department in Ajmer-Merwara (British Rajputana), for the year 1924-25. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S. remained in charge of the Civil Veterinary Department in Ajmer-Merwara throughout the year under report. 2. He inspected the Veterinary Dispensaries at Ajmer and Beawar and was on tour in Ajmer-Merwara for 6 days and travelled 1,098 miles by rail and 26 miles by road. While at Ajmer, he attended an outbreak of Rinderpest at Saradhna and Kesarpura. I.2 (iv) PREVENTIVE INOCULATION. 12. In 14 outbreaks of Rinderpest, in the Ajmer District, 1,357 head of cattle were inoculated with Anti-Rinderpest Serum. Four hundred and forty-seven uninoculated animals and 10 inoculated animals died in the course of these outbreaks. (v) OTHER DISEASES. Table IV. 13. The number of villages visited by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Ajmer, and the Salutri, Beawar, was 90 against 81 in the previous year. They treated 278 cases of contagious and 1,489 cases of non-contagious disease during their tours against 1,561 cases treated for contagious and 188 for non-contagious disease in the previous year. (vi) VETERINARY HOSPITALS. Table V 14. As in the previous year, there were two Veterinary hospitals working in the province during the year under report. The num- ber of cases treated was 1,652 as against 1,900 in the previous year. The decrease in the number of cases treated is due to the fact that the Beawar Hospital was closed for over two months and the Veterinary Assistant was then replaced by a Salutri with a view to exercising economy in expenditure. Medicines and advice were given to the owners of 403 animals not brought to the dispensaries. 15. Ajmer Veterinary Hospital.3 treated in the previous year. Of the 351 cases treated this year, 124 were equines, 176 bovines and 51 other animals. In addition, 7 bovines were castrated during the year. The Salutri visited only one village and treated 50 animals for contagious disease against 8 villages visited and 13 cases treated for non-contagious diseases in the previous year. III.4 head of cattle with Anti-Rinderpest Serum with successful results, When the disease first broke out, cattle-owners were chary of having their cattle inoculated but were persuaded by Khan Sahib Abdul Haq with the help of the local officials. The disease was probably brought into Ajmer-Merwara from the neighbouring Indian States where the disease has been very prevalent during the year. J. H. G.

Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment in Ajmer Merwara (British Rajputana) for the Year 1938-39. I. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I. V. S., was in charge of the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Ajmer-Merwara from 1st April to 9th May 1938 and from 8th November 1938 to 31st March 1939. He was on leave out of India from 10th May to 7th November 1938 and Rao Bahadur V. R. Phadke (Retired), Bombay Veterinary Service, Class I Officer officiated. Rao Bahadur V. R. Phadke inspected three Veterinary Dispensaries and was on tour for 7 days and travelled 1,102 miles by rail and 118 miles by road, as against 805 miles by rail and 118 miles by road travelled by the Director of Veterinary Services, in the previous year. 2. The post of Veterinary Investigation Officer, Sind and Ajmer-Merwara was held by Mr. H. S. Bawa, M. R. C. V. S. This officer spent 44 days on tour in Ajmer-Merwara and travelled 4,374 miles by rail and 474 miles by road. He carried out a detailed investigation of Rinderpest in sheep and goats and methods for their immunisation. II. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. 3. Table I.2 (iii) OTHER ANIMALS. (a) Sheep. 12.

BREEDING OPERATIONS. 23. Table VI. A.4 with if the administrative Head of the Deparmtment was in Ajmer and could be consulted by local officers. It is suggested therefore that the Department in Ajmer-Merwara should be placed under the control of a full time Deputy Director as early as possible. The Sind Department is expanding and the Di- rector will have less and less time to spend on the work in Ajmer-Merwara. About two years ago, a scheme for the appointment of a Deputy Director, who would be in administrative control of the Department was under considera- tion but upto now no decision has been arrived at.
