There was a comparatively high mortality from contagious diseases amongst cattle, rinderpest accounting for 42,155 deaths against 20,842 in the previous year. This is attributed to a low vitality consequent on shortage of fodder which decreases the ability to resist disease. The number of deaths from foot and mouth disease was 2,592 against 536 in the year 1918-19 and hæmorrhagic septicæmia was responsible for 6,319 deaths against 5,349. While it is a matter of gratification that vaccinations against hæmorrhagic septicæmia are increasing in popularity it is to be regretted that inoculation against rinderpest had to be restricted owing to the shortage of serum. The Punjab is largely an agricultural province and the agriculturists' is took in trade consists to a large extent of his cattle. It is, therefore, essential that outbreak of disease amongst cattle should be prevented at the earliest opportunity, and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts that local officers will insist on prompt reports by the Patwari staff of the outbreak of disease. Amongst equines 15 cases of glanders were dealt with in the Gurdaspur District by the Civil Veterinary Department, and three cases in the Rawalpindi District by the Army Remount Department. Surra was prevalent in the districts of Ferozepore, Shahpur, Gujrat, Amritsar, and Dera Ghazi Khan, and the steps taken by the Department to combat this disease, in spite of the shortage of staff, are credit- able. Fortunately no case of dourine occurred during the year. 5. The number of veterinary hospitals in the Province increased by two and is now 131, in addition to which there are six dispensaries. A sum of Rs. 48,000 has been allotted for the construction of new hospital buildings and improve- ment of the existing ones. These institutions are increasing in value and popularity, and the number of patients con- tinues to rise. There is room for many more veterinary hospitals, and Sir Edward Maclagan hopes that private- munificence will be forthcoming to supplement public expenditure in this direction. Cattle Insurance Societies are being promoted in several districts in the Province, and the inhabitants of the Rohtak District are anxious to start re-insurance unions in order to save the primary societies from ruin in case of serious outbreak of epidemics.
3 The question of a financial guarantee by Government to such unions will shortly be referred to the Government of India. 6. The progress already achieved in cattle-breeding is creditable to the Civil Veterinary Department. The number of stud bulls working in the Province increased by 82 to 1,352, and 198 bulls were sent out by the Govern- ment Cattle Farm at Hissar. The scheme for subsidising selected owners of the Dhanni bulls has worked satisfactorily and the Lieutenant-Governor is pleased to observe that the Chief Superintendent is hopeful of reviving the breed which showed signs of extinction a short time ago. The popularity of three-quarter and half-bred merino rams continues and during the year under review the Hissar Farm supplied 110 rams to private individuals and three to the Jullundur District Board. 7. Mr. Branford is again to be congratulated on his successful management of the Hissar Cattle Farm, which enjoyed a healthy year. Owing to the absence of grazing from the 1st of April to August, stall-feeding had to be resorted to, and the cows were consequently not in very good condition. The profit and loss account showed a loss of Rs. 29,766 against a profit of Rs. 11,534 in the previous year. This is attributable to high price of gram, increased expendi- ture on stall-feeding, grant of various kinds of allowances to the employees, restricted sowings in 1918, and the conse- quently smaller outturn of the oats crop. 8. Although the Province has been fortunate in obtaining a number of promising recruits the year under report and the months immediately following it have laid a heavy hand on the veterinary services. Colonel Farmer, C.I.E., broke down in health towards the close of the year and proceeded on leave in March It was hoped that rest, if it did not restore his full energy would at least prolong his life, but news of his death at Home reached India a short time ago. His administration of the Depart- ment was always characterised by ability and enthusiasm, and the Lieutenant-Governor has little doubt that he sacri- ficed his health to the work in which he was so interested. In him the Government has lost a very capable officer and the Department and the people of the Province a most sympathetic friend. The retirement of Colonel Pease and
4 of Mr. Burke and the death of Saiyad Mehtab Shah have already been recorded. Captain Morris retired from the Hissar Cattle Farm after 32 years' service there. Death robbed the Farm of the services of Mr. MacCutchan and the Province of those of Captain Daunt Meadows, the Camel Specialist. Mr. George Taylor was transferred to Bombay on the return to the Punjab of Colonel Walker. 9. His Honour's thanks are also due to the officers of all grades of the Department for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their respective duties. 23 DANote on the Veterinary progress in the Punjab by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab. The Punjab Veterinary College. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WALKER took over charge of the post of Principal of the Punjab Veteri- nary College from Colonel Pease on 20th July 1919, and he has initiated many reforms with characteristic energy and administrative ability. Captains Sewell and Dowland joined on October 15th and the 1st December 1919, as Post Graduate Professor and Professor of Sanitary Science respectively. Mr. Burke, I. S. O., Professor of Surgery, retired on March 31st, after- noon, after a meritorious service of more than 10 years in the College. Captain Dowland is now working as Professor of Surgery in addition to his own duties, and it is understood that the Secretary of State is recruiting an Imperial Officer to fill the vacancy. The death of Khan Bahadur Syed Mehtab Shah, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, on 28th May 1920, is regretted. Revision of salaries is under the consideration of the Government. There were 81* admis- sions as against 78 last year : 57 for 3 years' course and 24 for 4 years' course. The four years' course was how- ever abandoned. Fifty- six men passed the final examination (3 years' course) and out of these 17 were Punjab Civilian Students. The post-graduate course was held in abeyance. Colonel Walker has drawn up an outline scheme for a 4 years' course, which has been approved by the Gov- ernment of India. He has latterly drawn up a syllabus, which is being sent up. Instruction will be in English. *Indian Cavalry ... 28 3 years' course.

The present hostel has been put in charge of an Assistant Pro- fessor and Colonel Walker has made many other improve- ments. Colonel Walker has declined to have anything to do with the Branch Veterinary Hospital at Aitchison Ganj, Lahore, as he considers, I think rightly, that his duties are educational only. Mr. Quirke has now examined the pro-
2 posals, and I have sent a draft agreement of the lines of working to the Municipal Committee. District Work. Cattle disease. 2. Colonel Farmer, Chief Superintendent, proceeded on 8 months leave on 22nd March 1920, and Mr. Quirke has, except for a very brief interregnum, officiated since that date. Should Colonel Farmer not return the Province will have lost its most enthusiastic Veterinary Officer. Mr. Garewal is holding charge of the North Punjab and though he has not been in the best of health appears to take a keen interest in his work. Captain Doyle joined the Department on 28th March 1920, and has been posted to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for training. 3. The figures of deaths from contagious diseases are given below :3 against him, and his bearings may be in error. I have made proposals elsewhere in an apercu of the situation, for obtaining our bearings and accelerating our rate of progres- sion. The shortage of quantity in farm and dairy stock is indicated by the following figures:4 I must refer especially to the grants for the breeding of Dhanni Cattle of 4,200 and 2,880 made by Govern- ment from Wheat Profits to the District Boards of Attock and Jhelum. The Rawalpindi District Board has also start- ed a Dhanni breeding scheme without direct assistance. The numbers of District Board and subsidised Dhanni bulls in these 3 districts at present are5 There was a great demand for the stock outside India. Photographs of farm stock have been included in the report, and are really more valuable than double the amount of printed matter usually is. Attention should be drawn to Mr. Branford's observa- tion of the effect of insufficient food in reducing the fertility of cattle. Mr. Branford's administration of the farm is thorough- ly efficient, and his knowledge of cattle-breeding is one of the assets of the Province. S. M. JACOB, Dated 3rd August 1920. Offg.

6 Annual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1919-20. DURING the year under report the staff of Gazetted officers underwent some important changes. Gazetted Staff. Colonel H. T. Pease, C.I.E., Veterinary Department, after many years of devoted service as Principal of the College and Professor of Equine Medicine, proceeded on leave pending retirement on July 1st. He was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel G. K. Walker, C.I.E., O.B.E, who took over charge on July 20th. Mr. E. Burke, I. S.O., who had completed 37 years' service in the department, of which about eleven had been spent at the College as Professor of Surgery, retired on March 31st. He was a very efficient and popular officer and he will be greatly missed. No permanent successor has been appointed up to the date of the submission of this report. Captains Sewell and Dowland, on appointment to the department, joined the staff on October 15th and 1st De- cember (afternoon), respectively. The former took over the appointment of Post Graduate Professor and the latter that of Professor of Sanitary Science and remained under train- ing. The other officers of the staff retained the appoint- ments held by them during the previous year throughout the year under report. Non-gazetted Staff. 2. The non-gazetted teaching staff was short-handed owing to the lack of suitable applicants on the terms offered. The matter has been represented and a revision of salaries is under consider- ation. Sardar Hardit Singh performed the duties of Lecturer in Botany and Chemistry in addition to his own. M. Karam Ellahi was appointed Hostel Superintendent in addition to his own duties. Sessions. 3. The summer session commenced on May 1st and closed on June 30th. The winter session opened on October 1st and concluded at the end of the year under report.
7 Admissions. 4. There were 81 admissions on May 1st as detailed in last year's report. Course of study. 5. At the beginning of the winter session it was de- cided to abandon definitely the four years' course as at present conducted. It had been practically in abeyance since its inception for reasons connected with the war and shortage of staff. Those students who had passed the three years' course examinations were given their diplomas and the remainder were absorbed in the three years' course. Proposals were made for a revised course involving four years' study in English, the preliminary examination being the matricula- lation qualification or its equivalent. The proposals have been accepted by the Local Government and cordially ap- proved by the Government and of India. They will be brought into force when the necessary arrangements have been made. Post graduate instruction. 6. The post graduate course did not materialise owing to lack of candidates, but three Veteri- nary Assistants from the Behar and Orissa Civil Veterinary Department were given special instruction. A scheme for imparting post graduate instruction has been embodied in the revised course of study and will be instituted in due course. In the meantime the necessary preparations are being made. Examination results. 7. Supplementary examinations were held in June for those students who had failed in one subject only in the annual examina- tions. The results were as follows:8 The results of the annual examinations held in March and April 1920 were as follows:9 Income. 12. The income during the year amounted to Rs. 20,612 against Rs. 21,239 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the forge having been closed for part of the year. The outstandings amounted to Rs. 1,791. Every effort is being made to realise the money, but some accounts are of long standing and will have to be written off. Expenditure. 13. The expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 1,34,882 against Rs. 1,08,024 in the previous year. The salaries of the newly appointed officers, the temporary allowances granted to the members of the staff, and the general rise in prices account for the increase. General remarks. 14. The behaviour of the students was generally satis- factory and their health on the whole good. The average number residing in the hostel was 159. Every effort has been made to make the present tem- porary arrangements satisfactory and some improvements have been made, but considerable difficulty is experienced in meeting messing expenses from the balance of fees re- maining for that purpose. A proposal to reduce the rent payable to Government was rejected. Plans and estimates for a new hostel are being pre- pared. The play-ground is nearing completion and should be ready for use next winter. 15. The members of the staff gave the Principal their loyal support and worked to his satisfaction throughout the year. Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1919-20. BY MR. T. F. QUIRKE, M.R.C.V.S., CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT. PART I.10 of touring performed by them during the year under report:11 received of his death from drowning on 11th October 1919, his untimely death is a great loss to the Department. Colonel Farmer C.I.E., Chief Superintendent, proceeded on 8 months' combined leave with effect from 22nd March 1920 after handing over charge to Mr. T. F. Quirke who held the appointment upto the end of the year. The latter held charge of the appointment of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab, with effect from 1st April 1919 to 26th May 1919. He remained on combined leave from 27th May 1919 to 4th February 1920 and worked as an officer on special duty from 5th February 1920 to 22nd March 1920. The most important change in the Imperial staff was the transfer of Mr. G. Taylor to Poona as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. He was relieved by Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram on the afternoon of 5th July 1919. The latter remained incharge of the South Punjab Circle upto the end of the year under report. Pandit Janki Nath, Veterinary Inspector, attached to the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, South Punjab, Ferozepore, officiated as Deputy Sup- erintendent in place of Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram for 6 months and 25 days, i.e., 5th September 1919 to 31st March 1920. He was placed in quasi-independent charge of the districts of Montgomery, Lyallpur, Jhang, Multan Muzaf- fargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan with his head-quarters at Ferozepore. Mr. Garewal remained attached to the offices of Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, and Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, with effect from 1st April 1919 to 6th May 1919 and 8th May 1919 to 26th May 1919, respectively. He relieved Mr. Quirke on the afternoon of 26th May 1919 and offi- ciated as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-West Frontier Province and North Punjab from 27th May 1919 to 31st March 1920. 2. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, continues to hold charge of the North-West Frontier Province Civil Veterinary Department administra- tion. Now that the war is over, the question of the appoint- ment of a separate Superintendent should be taken up as
22 soon as possible, as it is very difficult for one officer to hold double charge for an indefinite period. 3. As usual the Chief Superintendent, Superintendents and the Deputy Superintendent toured in their respective circles in connection with horse and cattle breeding, investi- gation of contagious diseases and for the inspection of Veterinary Hospitals, etc. 4. They also interviewed District Officers in the course of their tours on the Veterinary requirements of their districts. District Board bulls and stallions were as usual regularly inspected. In addition to their own work the officers of this department materially assisted the Army Remount Department particularly in connection with Dourine, Surra and other equine diseases. 5. The Chief Superintendent inspected the following hospitals outside his own circle:13 I.14 equines especially. The present situation may be compared to a skeleton army attacking a strongly organised force. Dourine15 Boards, we might go on further now and arrange for the manufacture of our own serum for which there is an in- creasing demand.

III18 During the year under report there were 174 casualties and 256 additions. The detail of the latter is given be- low:19 results. The system on which it is based, namely, of sub- sidising specially selected privately owned bulls has appealed to the ordinary zamindar who dreads the responsibility of keeping a bull the property of the District Board. The scheme, however, is particularly suited to the villages of this tract which form the original home of the famous Dhanni or Awankari breed. It is hoped that with proper supervi- sion and further financial assistance to the scheme the per- manence of this breed in the Dhanni Tract can be establish- ed which was a short time ago in danger of extinction.

Very often mares let loose on so-called grazing areas are covered by inferior stallions the resulting progeny being put down to Government stallions. Services of horse, pony and donkey stallions.21 IV.22 the Sheikhupura District which was constituted during the year. The total number of subordinates working at the close of the year was:23 heavy mortality which could be considerably reduced if there was sufficient staff to deal with it. Not alone is the Department suffering from a shortage of subordinate staff, but also the superior staff is considerably curtailed for the amount of work which has to be dealt with. If it is found necessary to have a Civil Surgeon for each district the posi- tion of the 3 Superintendents can be appreciated who have the whole Punjab and North-West Frontier Province to deal with. The system of redistribution of charges amongst the Superintendents requires to be considered with a view to reducing the charge of the Superintendent, South Punjab, and also relieving the Chief Superintendent, who, in addition to the executive charge of the nine districts in the Central Punjab, deals with the administrative work of the entire province. The Chief Superintendent's thanks are due to Mr. Garewal and Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram, Superintendents, and also to Pundit Janki Nath, officiating Deputy Superintend- ent, for their loyal support and also to all District Officers who have so kindly assisted this Department. Annual Report for 1919-20. 1. I was incharge of the Farm throughout the year. 2. Captain R. Morris, Deputy Superintendent, retired from Farm and Government service on 31st March 1920. Captain Morris had 40 years service to his credit, and had served 39 years in India, 32 at Hissar, on this Farm. His long experience has been of the greatest value to a succes- sion of Superintendents. He was always most hard-work- ing and zealous, and will be much missed. 3. The Farm suffered severe loss in the unfortunate death of the Farm Bailiff Mr. C. E. B. Maccutchan who died from heat-stroke on June 17th. Mr. Maccutchan joined the Farm in 1902. He was a good worker, always con- siderate and tactful with the men under him, and will be much missed. 4. The total rainfall during 1919 was 11.85&quot; as against 7.85&quot; in 1918, and an annual average of 14&quot;. The
24 rainfall during July, August and September was 8.21&quot;, the remainder was winter rain, which is practically useless as far as grazing grasses are concerned. Rainfall was a little below average, but growth of Bir grasses was on the whole up to average. 5. Grazing was good from August to the end of the year, and 13,973 maunds and 30 seers of hay were saved as against 5,086 maunds 22 seers in the previous year. 6. Fodder in reserve at the close of the year amounted to 63,779 maunds 2 seers as against 85,109 maunds 29 seers on the 1st April 1919. Fodder consumed again exceeded fodder saved. This was due almost entirely to general stall feeding of stock, owing to absence of grazing from the 1st of April to August. A good year in which we can save more than we consume will soon be urgently necessary. 7. Demand for Farm stock continued good. Receipts amounted to Rs. 1,81,231, very little less than the record attained last year. 8. The year was again a very satisfactory one as regards contagious diseases. The following occurred:25 The foot-path erected for male-stock at Chaoni was again successful in diminishing the feet deformi- ties which commonly follow untreated cases of this disease. (d) Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.26 from April to July, as there was not an atom of grazing in the area reserved for them till August. They suffered less than usual from contagious diseases. An area in their grazing ground suspected to be heavily infected with Black- quarter is being ploughed up and cultivated in the hope that opening up the soil and exposing to sun and air will destroy the source of infection. The following were sold:27 In addition following were purchased locally for the other Departments:28 Eighteen two years old surplus fillies sold by auction at Amritsar realized an average of Rs. 124 each. Sixty foals were born. Donkey breeding met with a serious loss in the sudden death in February of the young stallion 'Hindustan,' the best donkey I have ever seen in India. Mule-breeding mares.29 10. Cultivation.30 The usual difficulties were met with as regards the successful cultivation of jowar (Sorghum vulgare), enhanced in the year under report, by difficulty in obtaining seed. This was so acute that the rate of seed per acre was decreased. This device however did not pay, the resulting crop was too thick in the stalk and consequently less palatable to stock, resulting in waste in feeding. Insect pests (chiefly the jowar borer) caused the usual amount of trouble and loss. The area sown with oats was 30 per cent. greater than in 1918. The crop did well and promises to yield rather over average. The cultivation was handicapped by the unfortunate death of the Farm Bailiff in June as report d above. A new Farm Bailiff, Mr. W. S. Read, late of the 1/25th London Territorial Regiment was appointed in November 1919. Mr. Read has had some experience of Indian condi- tions in the Military Farms Department and promises to do well. From June 17th to November 18th the 2nd Farm Overseer, M. Ata Mohammad, officiated as Farm Bailiff with great credit. 11. Veterinary Hospital.31 Guar (Cyampsis psoralioides) was the cheapest grain suitable for cattle obtainable, and something was saved by its substitution for gram. Guar is popularly supposed to be only suitable for cattle stock and only suitable for them in the cold weather. In the year under report it was fed to cattle through- out the year, and was also fed at times to mares, mules and donkeys. I hope if adequate supervision can be arranged to carry out this year some comparative feeding experiments comparing gram and guar. 13. As usual the work of the Farm staff has been very satisfactory. The office staff has been supplemented by the appointment of an additional clerk, sanctioned during the year, and the second clerk returned from Military duty. The Bir Darogha did well, considering the light rain at hay making. 14.

ABBOTT, ESQ., C.I.E., I.C.S., Financial Commissioner (Development), Secretary to Government, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE AND AGRICULTURE. Ministry of Agriculture. SIR, I AM directed to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the annual report on the Punjab Veterinary College, Civil Veterinary Department, and Government Cattle Farm at Hissar, for the year 1920- 21, together with a review of Veterinary progress in the Pro- vince by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab. Veterinary College. 2. At the Veterinary College the record of the year was one of steady if uneventful pro- gress under the able direction of the Principal, Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, C.I.E., O.B.E. The new members of the superior staff underwent various kinds of training during the year and will be ready to assist in making the new four years course a success. The number of new students in this the last year of the old three years course was only one less than in the preceding year. The large increase in the number of Punjab Civil students is of special importance to the Province. The percentage of passes in the various examinations was very satisfactory. The work at the hospital attached to the College was well maintained. The number of in-patients rose from 1,280 in 1919-20 to 1,297, though there was a decrease from 1,904 to 1,790 in the number of out-patients. Continued success
2 attended the anti-rabic treatment of dogs. There have been only 9 known failures out of 224 cases dealt with since the system was adopted, and 31 dogs were treated during the year under report. It is to be regretted that the Lahore Municipal Com- mittee has been unable to accept the liabilities of the Branch Veterinary Hospital which it was proposed to estab- lish in the city. District work. 3. There was a remarkable decrease, attributable to the dryness of the year, in the mortality from contagious diseases. The total number of reported deaths decreased from 56,089 in 1919- 20 to 25,200. There were no cases of glanders, anthrax or dourine, and only 37 deaths from Surra compared with 65 in the previous year. Rinderpest accounted for 14,594 deaths among cattle as against 42,155 in 1919-20. The number of deaths from foot and mouth disease dropped from 2,592 to 301, and from Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia from 6,319 to 4,459. The only figures that show an increase are those of deaths from Black-quarter which rose from 242 to 604, the heaviest mortality occurring in the Dhanni Tract of the Attock District where the disease is endemic. It is gratifying to learn that public opinion is showing signs of responding to the persistent propaganda of the Department in favour of preventive measures by inoculation and vaccination. The number of anti-rinderpest inoculations rose from 106,626 in the previous year to 115,584, though the number of the outbreaks of the disease declined from 816 to 524. A similar decline (from 73 to 50) in the number of outbreaks was responsible for a slight decrease from 18,741 to 13,279 in the number of inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Vaccinations against Black- quarter increased from 2,912 to 6,380 and while those against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia decreased from 57,336 to 47,551, the number of villages in which they were performed rose from 213 in 18 districts to 232 in 20 districts. 4. The addition of eight new Veterinary Hospitals dur- ing the year raised the total number to 139. The number of animals treated in these hospitals and in the 5 dispensaries of the Province increased from 3,19,712 in the previous year to 3,37,407 and the number of castrations performed from 12,397 to 13,791. The growing interest taken by the public in the activities of the Veterinary Department is evinced by the fact that private contributions were received during the year towards the opening of three new hospitals and
3 numerous offers were made of buildings or of assistance to wards their erection. An adequate supply of Veterinary hos- pitals together with a numerous and well qualified Veterinary staff is of vital importance to the Province and despite the many other calls on its purse, Government is rendering every assistance in its power. A grant of Rs. 48,000 out of wheat profits was placed at the disposal of 16 District Boards to help towards the building of Veterinary Hospitals and the subor- dinate Veterinary staff has been increased by the addition of 4 new Veterinary Inspectors and 10 Assistants. The cadre at the end of the year numbered 226 as compared with 210 in the previous year. 5. There were 1,440 stud bulls at work in the Province at the close of the year under report as against 1,352 in the previous year. A record number (236 of Hissar Bulls was supplied to districts from the Hissar Farm. The Dhanni Bull Breeding Scheme had a successful year despite the shortage of fodder arising from the failure of the rains and there are 42 selected bulls now working in the Dhanni country. This part of the Punjab suffers from an absence of any irrigated tract from which reserves of fodder can be drawn in times of famine nor has the local cultivator yet learnt to store his fodder in stacks to provide for bad years. These matters are rightly receiving close attention from the Department, and Mr. .Townsend's suggestion that Govern- ment should purchase wheat bhusa in the Canal Colonies in good years and store it for use in bad years in the dry tracts of the Province, merits further investigation. The cattle census showed a decline of 7 per cent. in the number of cattle in the province. For this Mr. Townsend gives interesting and fairly conclusive reasons. There are signs of a reaction however and it is hoped that the greater area now being put down under fodder crops is evidence of a revival of interest in cattle-breeding which will have beneficial results on this essential factor in the prosperity of the Punjab. Hissar Farm. 6 The Hissar Cattle Farm bad to face a series of misfor- tunes resulting in a loss of Rs. 90,832 in the profit and loss account of the year's working as against a loss of Rs. 29,766 last year and a profit of Rs. 11,534 in the previous year. These figures however take credit for bulls and donkey stallions sold to District Boards at the concession rates and not at the full value, but for which the loss this year would have been reduced to Rs. 53,582. The shortage of rain produced a fodder famine, while out- breaks of Anthrax, Black-quarter, contagions abortion and
4 Rinderpest, which occurred in spite of the dryness of the season, threatened to undo the good work of years. At the same time record receipts (Rs. 2,02,500) from sale of Farm stock and a record supply of bulls to District Boards are redeeming features and Mr. Branford and his staff are to be congratulated on the care and efficiency with which they administered the Farm throughout a very trying year. General. 7. The almost irreparable loss which the Veterinary Department of the Province sustained by the untimely death of Lieutenant- Colonel Farmer, C.I.E., at Dublin on the 29th August 1920, while on leave, was noticed in the previous year's review. Government is fortunate in finding in Mr. Quirke an able and zealous successor who is keeping alight the sacred fire of enthusiasm kindled by Lieutenant-Colonel Farmer. Both he and his staff and the whole Veterinary De- partment deserve commendation for an excellent year's work in very up-hill circumstances. The Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture) is also indebted to Mr. Townsend for an interesting and suggestive review. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, E. R. ABBOTT, Financial Commissioner (Development), Secretary to Government, Punjab. No. 718-24NOTE ON VETERINARY PROGRESS IN THE PUNJAB IN 1920-21 BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, PUNJAB, LAHORE. Lieut-Colonel Walker, C. I. E., O. B. E., was Princi- pal of the Punjab Veterinary College throughout the year. Captain U. W. F. Walker, I. C. V. D., (a new recruit) was appointed to act as Professor of Surgery in the College, with effect from 15th October 1920, relieving Captain K. J. S. Dowland, Professor of Sanitary Science, of the additional duties of Professor of Surgery. Captain U. Walker is, however, as at present arranged, designed for district work in the North Punjab, to succeed Mr. Garewal who will take charge of the post of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department in the North-West Frontier Province in April 1922. So an Imperial officer is required for the Chair of Surgery. *Matriculates ... 11 Non-Matriculates ... 69 Eighty *students were admitted in May 1920 for the three years' course, as against eighty- one last year: out of these 39 belonged to the Punjab. Fifty-six men passed the final examination held in April 1921, and two, who had failed only in one subject last year, were examined again in June 1920 and passed. Out of the total number of 58, 21 were Punjab Civilian students. The results were very satisfactory throughout. Captains Sewell and Dowland were deputed for district training in turn under the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, Punjab, Lahore, and at the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, and therefore no post-graduate course- could be held: and with the introduction of the new four years' course in English in October next no separate post-gra- duate course, will remain, at any rate for the present. It is, however, proposed to institute a post-diploma course by which students, who have obtained their diploma under the old system, will attend lectures on additional subjects in the third and fourth years under the new system, thus qualifying themselves for higher posts that may fall vacant. The question of the eventual language through which veterinary instruction should be given will, it is understood, B
2 be considered by a Committee to be appointed for the pur- pose: but for the present instruction is to be imparted in English. An additional appointment in the Provincial veterinary Service has been sanctioned with effect from 1st October 1921, and further minor appointments have also been sanctioned. The question of raising the value of many of the existing scholarships in the college is being considered separately. The number of in-patients treated in the hospital show a very slight increase on the figures of the previous year, but the number of out-patients decreased from 1,904 in the previous year to 1,790 in the year under report: 521 in-patients and 458 out-patients were treated in the dog hospital, as against 564 and 321 respectively last year. The Municipal Committee, Lahore has unfortunately expressed its inability to accept the liabilities of the Branch Veteri- nary Hospital, which it was proposed to erect in Lahore City. 2. Mr. T. F. Quirke officiated as Chief Superintend- ent, throughout the year: his permanent appointment as such has recently been notified. The changes in the super- vising staff during the year are noticed in his report. I agree that Colonel Farmer's death was almost irreparable: the not small strides the Civil Veterinary department has made in popularity with the Punjab peasantry during recent years was largely due to Colonel Farmer's zeal, activity, and persuasiveness, particularly in dealing with zamindars. The sooner the North-West Frontier Province Adminis- tration gets their own wholetime Superintendent the better: there is ample work for a wholetime officer in the North Punjab Circle, particularly now that a start has been made with the Dhanni Cattle breeding scheme. As Mr. Quirke says, the year was generally healthy for cattle, on account of its dryness: but, for the same reason, fodder was scarce, and the mortality, particularly aniong old and infirm cattle, from want of food must have been high. His report bears abundant evidence to the good work done by his staff, and the increasing popularity, already mentioned, of his department with the peasantry of the province. Other proofs of this are the offers he receives from time to time from individuals, either to provide free of
3 charge a building for a veterinary hospital that is desired, or to pay the whole, or part, of the cost of building one: during the year under report private contributions were received towards the opening of three veterinary hospitals. Again, the number of persons who, wishing Hissar bulls to be sent to their villages, offer to pay the greater part of the cost of them, is increasing annually. In 1920-21 the cost of at least 75 per cent. of the total number of bulls provid- ed by the Hissar Farm (239) was paid for wholly, or in part, by zamindars. 3. The recently instituted scheme for the breeding of Dhanni bulls, the breed popular north of the Jhelum, has had a difficult (on account of fodder shortage), but on the whole successful, year. Since its inception in 1919, 5,178 cows have been covered by the selected bulls in the three districts of Attock, Jhelum and Rawalpindi in which the scheme has been started. In these districts 42 selected bulls are now working. The problem of improving the Dhanni breed is in many ways more difficult than in the case of the Hissar breed. Thus there is no irrigated tract, as in Hariana, the home of the Hissar cow, from which reserves of fodder can be drawn in bad years: another difficulty is the fact that the cultivator of the Dhanni tract, so fond is he of cattle, generally buys, in good years, more cattle than he can keep in bad years, and has not yet learnt how to con- serve his bajra and jowar fodder in stacks, from good years, as has his fellow cultivator of Rohtak. These matters are receiving attention. The five grantees of cattle grants in the Lower Bar Doab Colony are doing well on the whole: though I am doubtful as to the advisability of repeating this experiment. I consider it would probably be both wiser and more econo- mical in the long run for Government to start its own farms, as that at Hissar, but smaller, should it wish to encourage any particular breed in future. Some such encourage- ment will have to be given both to the Montgomery and the Dajal breed, of Dera Ghazi Khan, before very long. The dairy farm grantee, near Montgomery, has been put in possession of his grant, having returned from train- ing in England. A similar grant, to suitable persons, to improve the milk and the supply of Lahore city is under consideration.
4 4. The Hissar Cattle Farm has been administered, as usual, by Mr. Branford with much care and efficiency. The farm had a bad year, shortage of rain being accompanied by severe outbreaks of disease: a most unusual combination. The number of Hissar bulls that were taken by districts was 239: a record figure. Mr. Branford and his staff are to be congratulated on bringing the farm so well through a troubled time. 5. Not only those officers, but the whole of the Vete- rinary staff in the province have by their hard work and enthusiasm deserved well of the State during the year under report. Young in years, Mr. Quirke has discretion and judgment beyond them; and Colonel Walker's experience, of which he makes the fullest use in his management of the Veterinary College, is of the greatest value to Government. 6. I would add a few general observations on cattle in general, and Veterinary work in particular, in the Punjab. The Veterinary department is now a 'trans- ferred' subject, and there are indications that the Pro- vincial Legislative Council, in which the rural element is strongly represented, will be willing to devote a larger share of public monies to that department than has been hitherto the case. This is all to the good. Good plough bullocks are the backbone of our agriculture: and a supply of abundant and cheap milk and ghee, to produce which good animals are required, appeals as strongly to the city-man as to the villager. Again, no one item probably is the cause of more debt to the agriculturist than mortality among his cattle, much of which would be preventible was veterinary assistance at hand more promptly than is possible at present, whether for inoculation, vaccination, or treat- ment. The cattle census of last year showed a decline of about 7 per cent. in the number of cattle in the Province. In this decline I notice this province was not peculiar: it was common to most provinces in India. Various reasons for it are put forward. Personally I have no doubt that it is due, in the main, to two reasons. The first is the bad years, speaking very generally, the province has had, agricul- turally, in the last decennium. On the whole it was below average, and the crops of bajra and jowar, important fodders, which are principally grown on barani lands, were poor.
5 And the second is the great rise in prices, which has occurred of recent years, and was accentuated by the war, in the case of cotton, sugarcane, oil seeds and most non-fodder crops. Briefly, cattle breeders found that the growth of crops paid them better than the breeding of cattle, the price of which had not risen to the same extent. A reaction from this, and a healthy one, is showing itself this year. I find that the area placed under fodder crops this kharif in the canal irrigated tracts of the Province is 50 per cent. more than last year: that under cotton is about 25 per cent less. I do not think that the decreased areas under so called pasture land, charagah, has much, if anything, to do with this decline in the number of cattle. Save perhaps in the sub-montane districts of the province with heavy rainfall, and the riverain tracts, the grazing grounds of the province generally bear no grass unless artificially irrigated. But the water they require to grow grass will, if used to grow fodder crops in the ordinary agricultural rotation, support far more cattle than in the former case. The whole matter, the importance of which to the province cannot be exaggerated is worthy of the most detailed examination from every aspect, by the Provincial Board of Economic Enquiry. I have only one or two matters to mention. The Agri- cultural department has been unable owing to shortage of land and staff in the past to devote attention to fodder crops. As soon as those limiting factors are removed it should take up their study as intensively as possible. The possibilities of Government buying up wheat bhusa in the canal colonies in good years. when it is comparatively cheap, and storing it for use in bad years in the dry tracts of the province should also be investigated. The study of the comparative values of the various cattle foods offering in the province, as initiated at Hissar by Mr. Branford, should be continued. And finally more co-operation with the Military Dairies Department, as regards cattle breeding in the province generally, is desirable than has been practised in the past. C. A. H. TOWNSEND, 31st July 1921. Director of Agriculture, Punjab.

QUIRKE, M.R.C.V.S., CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT. PART I.10 While on combined leave the demise of Colonel Farmer, C.I.E., took place in Dublin on 29th August 1920. His death has caused an almost irreparable loss to the veteri- nary profession in general, and to the Civil Veterinary De- partment in particular. He was a most untiring worker and there is little doubt that his devotion to duty contri- buted much to his early death. Major F.G. Sykes, R.A.V.C., Deputy Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, Army Headquarters, Simla, having been demobilised on completion of Military service, was appointed temporarily for 3 years on a special agreement, and assumed charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab at Ferozepore, on the forenoon of 1st October 1920, relieving Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram, who held officiating charge Pandit Janki Nath continued to officiate as Deputy Superintendent in place of Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram form 1st April 1920 to 30th September 1920, daring which period the latter officiated as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab. The former remained in semi-independent charge of Montgomery, Multan, Lyallpur, Jhang, Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan districts with his headquarters at Ferozepore. 2. The two vacant posts of Deputy Superintendents were filled up during the year by M. Talib Khan and Pandit Janki Nath. The former took over charge of the duties of Deputy Superintendent at Rawalpindi on 18th October 1920, and the latter at Lahore on 23rd idem. Consequent upon the deputation of Pandit Janki Nath to Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore to officiate as Professor of Bovine Pathology and Obstetrics, M. Talib Ali was appointed as officiating Deputy Superintendent with effect from 27th January 1921. He held the appointment up to the end of the year under report. 3. Arrangements were made for the separation of North-West Frontier Province from 1st April 1921, but owing to the stringency of funds it had to be postponed for another year. It is hoped that the North-West Frontier Province Government will make a special effort to arrange for a separate officer from the beginning of the next financial year 1922-23. The introduction of the Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme in the Dhanni Tract, and the steady demand for increased veterinary supervision in the districts
11 of the North Punjab require the services of a full time officer with as little delay as possible. 4. As usual the Chief Superintendent, Superintendents and the Deputy Superintendents toured in their respective circles in connection with horse and cattle breeding, investigation of contagious diseases, and for the inspection of veterinary hospitals, etc. Towards the end of February 1921, the officers of this Department were relieved of the control of infectious equine diseases in the Lahore and Rawalpindi Army Remount Department horse breeding circles, which was undertaken by the Civil Veterinary Department on the outbreak of war at the request of the Director-General, Army Remount Department. In the course of their tours the officers of the Civil Veterinary Department make a special point of interviewing district officers and all representative zamindars on the veterinary requirements of the districts. The Chief Superintendent inspected the following veterinary hospitals outside his own circle:12 PART II.13 Anti-Rinderpest inocula- tions.14 Preventive inoculations16 I (c)16 this year). The addition of the above hospitals, with more to follow in the near future, is a further proof of the steady growth of appreciation of the Department's work shown by Punjabi peasants. It is interesting to note here the reso- lution recently passed by the Lyallpur District Muslim Zamindars' Association, requesting the opening of a veteri- nary hospital in each zail of the district. Work at Veterinary Hospitals17 ment was Rs. 75 more than the fixed amount of Rs. 2,590 which it is necessary for the institution to pay annually, according to the terms of the transfer. Last year the net profit was Rs. 526. PART III.18 method of dealing with the situation is to increase the effi ciency of our animals for the work required of them by the judicious distribution of a large number of good bulls for breeding purposes in the districts. Efforts in this direction have been considerably hampered through want of funds. The present system under which funds are obtained for cattle-breeding is too precar- ious, dependant as we are altogether on the resources of the District Boards, on which there is already a heavy demand for objects which are popularly supposed to be more impor- tant than cattle-breeding. It has been suggested to prosperous agricultural co- operative societies that the purchase of bulls would be a profitable outlet for their surplus funds, and I am glad to say the idea is gaining ground. If, as pointed out by the Director of Agriculture, in his review on cattle-breeding last year, the number of stud bulls required in the Province comes to fifty thousand, our present rate of progress at about roughly two hundred per year requires to be quickened by some more efficient method of securing the necessary funds. In view of the economic importance of cattle-breeding I would suggest that Government might come to the assistance of the District Boards in the purchase of stud bulls. It is a matter for consideration whether in view of the large sums expended by Government on takkavi it would not be better to devote more attention to the preservation of cattle by the storing and importation of fodder in the more important cattle-breeding centres. The two most important cattle-breeding centres in the Punjab are the Hariana and Dhanni Tracts, both of which are subject to drought, yet up to date no adequate provision has been made against the loss of valuable cattle which occurs in these areas in times of fodder scarcity. Experience has shown in the working of the Dhanni Breeding Scheme in the Dhanni Tract that the effects of a good year are undone in the next when there is shortage of fodder. It is clear that in view of the serious decrease in the number of cattle, the cattle resources of these important tracts should be carefully safeguarded by making adequate provision against fodder famine, and the necessary steps to ensure this should be taken with as little delay as possible. Attention has been drawn to the gradual disappearance of the valuable Montgomery milch breed of cattle from the
19 Montgomery District, in the hope that, on the colonization of the Nili Bar, the interests of cattle-breeders will be given full consideration. The necessity for more close co-ordi- nation of interests between the Military Dairies and the cattle-breeders in districts of particular importance in deal- ing with this breed, which is so largely sought after for milking purposes. We have in the Military Dairies of this country milk recording societies on a large scale, the re- sults of which, if properly turned to account for the benefit of the dairy industry, should be of the greatest assistance to cattle-breeders. It is satisfactory to learn that land is being acquired by the Military Dairy Farms for the rearing of young stock born on the dairies. - It is hoped that in the interests of the dairy industry this policy will be extended as far as possible in future. II20 The merino cross is making a certain amount of pro- gress in the districts in the hands of owners who take an interest in their flocks. The problem, however, of securing for the small owner the fair market value of his wool can only be dealt with on a co-operative basis; its solution would make for the popularity of the merino in the districts more than any other factor. IV.21 ties owing to mortality from disease, so that all the societies have had a favourable start. The progress of the movement will necessarily be slow; it would be too much to expect that the advantages of cattle insurance should readily appeal to all cattle owners: one must rather anticipate slow begin- nings and slow progress. It is a matter of congratulation that so far contagious disease has claimed veryfew victims amongst insured animals. It seems an opportune time therefore to examine the weak points of our system of control over outbreaks of contagious disease. When we find in the head- quarters of the, cattle insurance movement, the Rohtak Dis- trict, a quite inadequate veterinary staff, powerless to en- force even the most elementary rules of segregation, and a reporting agency consisting of Patwaries who do not yet realise the necessity of reporting disease when it occurs in their villages, it seems necessary to draw attention to the absence of safeguards being given to a movement which is now on trial in this province. PART IV.-Establishment. Numerical strength22 PART V.23 Annual Report of Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for 1920-21. 1. I was incharge of the Farm for the whole of the year under report. 2. The following officers of the Civil Veterinary Department were deputed to the Farm for training during the year:24 The year was also unlucky as regards disease, breaking the usual rule that dry years are healthy. The period of acute fodder famine began in November; stock generally at that time were in good condition, owing to the fortunate fact that most of what rain that did fall fell in one period, from July 25th to August 4th. These few wet days were sufficient to cause a growth of short grass, and stock had grazing from August 10th to the end of September. Had the above rain been spread over a longer period as often occurs, no grass at all might have appeared. From August 5th to the end of the year the total rain- fall was 1/10 th of an inch. 7. Fodder in reserve at the end of the year amounted to 11,896 maunds (of 82 lbs each) only, as against 63,779 maunds on the 1st April 1920. Fodder issued to stock during the year amounted to 176,760 maunds Of this all, except 6,099 maunds, was grown on the Farm. It was, of course, never possible to contemplate hay making during the year. All the fodder produced during the year was from the irrigated cultivation blocks. S. Contagious diseases.25 Since 1914, when this disease first assumed serious pro- portions, the percentage of mares aborting annually has been:26 9. Table XVI at the end of this report shows the changes in tbe Farm stock during the year. The following were the more important changes:27 The highest price realised for a pair of bullocks was Rs. 650. Mules28 Except for a severe outbreak of pneumonia at the end of the year, casualties among sheep were not excessive. The pneumonia was probably partly due to the abnor- mal weather, the first three weeks of March being hot up to 200 above normal: the last week just after the sheep were shorn was cold, being some degrees below nor- mal: and partly due to low condition owing to scanty grazing. Sheep and lambs in low condition are peculiarly sus- ceptible to pneumonia. 10. Cultivation.29 Jowar in 1920 was less damaged by insect pests than usual. Cut worm (a species of agratis) destroyed a few acres of freshly germinated jowar in April 1920. The borer worm did less damage than usual, possi- bly owing to attempts to destroy it in the moth stage by fire and light traps; more probably owing to the severe frost, which destroyed hibernating larvæ in February. Jowar crop 1920, was above average, and would have been the best on record, had it not been for the failure of the rains, and a prolonged stoppage of the canal for repairs in August. A small area of Japanese sarson as a cold weather green fodder crop was tried. It was not very successful, possibly because it was sown too late. The first cutting was about equal in weight to an average green oats cutting. The second cutting was poor. Everywhere it died after the second cutting. So far as my experience goes up-to-date, oats and lucerne are still the best cold weather green crops for this dis- trict. Cut worm was again destructive in early sown jowar in March 1921; and losses were very severe, some 25 acres be- ing destroyed. The Farm Bailiff, Mr. Read, and the second Farm. Overseer, M.

REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, PUNJAB, FOR THE YEAR 1921-22. Part I.ii Para. Subject. Page. I (a).iii Para. Subject. Page. 83 III.No. 7182 The figures for Punjab Civil Students do not necessarily indicate that the standard set is too high as a small entry is only to be expected for a new and untried course with a qualifying standard of entrance, which to a great extent shuts out the class of students previously seeking admis- sion. 4. The Ministry of Agriculture agrees that a return to the old 3 years' course is at present undesirable, nor is any further increase in the pay of Veterinary Assistants at present practicable. The question of introducing an A class of Veterinary Assistants similar to the A-class of Assistants in the Agricultural Department for graduates of the College who have passed the Intermediate Examination in Science before entering the College is, however, one which Government is prepared to consider. 5. The result of the annual examinations was report- ed by the Board of Examiners to be very satisfactory. The number of patients treated at the Hospital was well main- tained, and though there were fewer cases at the Dog Hospi- tal, 54 dogs were treated for rabies compared with 31 last year. The health and behaviour of the students are well reported on. Colonel Walker, who went on leave out of India on 13th February 1922 and handed over charge to Mr. Taylor, Professor of Pathology, may be congratulated on a satisfactory year's work. 6. That the College is splendidly equipped for research work must be admitted. Research with regard to rabies and in the diagnosis of Surra has, in fact, been carried out. More activity in this direction is undoubtedly desirable, but the Ministry of Agriculture recognises the limitations by which the Principal and his staff are impeded. The College, which is primarily a teaching institution, is in a transition stage and two different courses are still being carried on side by side. The senior officers are engaged not only in organi- sing the new course, but in training the younger Professors. There can be little of that undisturbed leisure without which serious research is impossible DISTRICT WORK. 7. The total number of reported deaths from contagi- ous diseases in the Province rose from the abnormally low figure of 25,200 in 1920-21 to 42,244. The year was extremely healthy for equines with no cases of Anth- rax or Dourine, only one case of glanders and 17 deaths from Surra compared with 37 last year. Among
3 bovines the continuance of the fodder shortage over the major part of the Province weakened their disease resisting powers and 36,720 deaths from contagious diseases were reported as against 20,166 last year. The migrations of the herds in search of fodder set up new centres of infection and the late rains neutralized, especially in the case of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, the immunity conferred by the abnormal dry- ness of the previous year. The staff, however, rose to the occasion and the extra work thrown on them is shown by the increase in the number of inoculations against Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia from 128,863 in 1920-21 to 176,699 and in the number of outbreaks from 574 to 940. The success of Septicæmia vaccinations in conferring im- munity on villages where the disease was previously rife is most gratifying. Complaints are still made about the report- ing of outbreaks by Patwaris and the system is stigmatized as haphazard. No effective substitute has, however, been suggested, but the introduction into the budget for 1922-23 of a grant of Rs. 6,000 for rewards for prompt reports by patwaris should stimulate their zeal. 8. The important touring work of Veterinary assistants was well maintained as is shown by the figures of 17,530 villages visited, 111,433 animals treated and 22,209 castra- tions, compared with 13,167 villages, 72,182 cases and 17,806 castrations in the preceding year. 9. In connection with this subject Mr. Jacob's remark that less than 3 per cent. of the cattle mortality of the Pro- vince is at present accounted for is typically arresting. A Veterinary Inspector has been appointed to inspect the Co-operative Cattle Insurance Societies and the figures which he is collecting in connection with this work may throw light on this important question. 10. The number of hospitals and dispensaries continues to increase. There were 147 of the former and 12 of the latter at the close of the year starting from 139 and 5, res- pectively, at the beginning. The cases treated numbered 360,715, as compared with 337,407 in the previous year. It will unfortunately be necessary to restrict in future the opening of new dispensaries owing to want of funds. Al- though the Veterinary Assistant only is paid for directly by Government, the whole cost of each new dispensary is in the end owing to the conditions of District Board finances paid for by Government. The Ministry acknowledges with pleasure the assistance given by the gentlemen named in the report towards the erection of new hospital buildings.
4 11. Little or no progress is reported under Cattle Breed- ing. The policy of the Department, to preserve and improve the indigenous breeds of the Province by a process of selec- tion is admirable, but out of the five main breeds, Hissar, Montgomery, Dhanni, Hariana and Dajal, practically noth- ing has been spent upon any except the Hissar cattle for which the expensive Hissar Farm is maintained. The results obtained at this farm show that given proper facilities the Department can effect much. The efforts to improve the Dhanni breed have yielded good results, and it is hoped to introduce similar measures in the case of the Hariana cattle. The Chief Superintendent's report, however, is unfortunately silent as to the success of the cattle-breed- ing grants on the Lower Bari Doab Canal from which much was expected. In the case of the Montgomery breed, milk- ing tests must obviously be the chief guide in the process of selection, and it is hoped that the arrangements made will result in accurate data. 12. But to secure any general cooperation in cattle breeding it has first to be brought home to the cattle owner that it pays to keep a good rather than a bad animal. Za- mindars are far from convinced of this at present owing to the mortality from contagious diseases and from starvation. Veterinary knowledge can assist to remove the former cause, but for the latter measures to secure a supply of fodder in famine seasons are necessary. But here again the difficulty arises that the expense of storing fodder is greater than the animals are worth. Fewer animals of better quality, though costing no more to feed would give the same amount of draught power and of milk. Towards improvement there- fore the first step necessary appears to be a recognition that, at any rate in the grazing tracts which suffer from famines, a restriction of numbers together with fodder storage must precede any general improvement of breed. 13. From this point of view the postponement of the proposed biometric cattle survey, the expense of which the Province could ill afford, need not be deplored. The indige- nous breeds are obviously capable of improvement and before collecting statistics to show whether improvement is being achieved or no it is desirable both to arouse a desire for im- provement and to provide facilities for gratifying the desire when aroused. HISSAR FARM. 14. The farm was again handicapped by fodder shortage
5 and a deficiency in rainfall for the seventh year in succes- sion. The heavy fall in October was too late for a maximum growth of grass. There was, therefore, large unforeseen ex- penditure on fodder. On the other hand, the condition of the stock was healthy and deaths from contagious diseases and abortion showed a considerable decline; for instance, there was no death from Rinderpest as compared with 30 in the previous year. The extra fodder expenditure, however, and various additions and alterations to farm buildings on which Rs. 41,312 was spent, were mainly responsible for a loss of Rs. 1,16,204 in the profit and loss account of the year's working, though without the concession rates of sales to District Boards, the loss would have been reduced to Rs 83,603. The value of the farm lies in its being the centre of the breeding operations of the Province and the supply of bulls to the various local bodies fell little short of that of the previous year. Mr. Branford was in charge of the farm till he went on leave on 20th March 1922 and has since been succeeded temporarily by Captain Sewell. Both Mr. Branford and the officials he names deserve credit for the year's work. ESTABLISHMENT. 15. There was no increase in the subordinate veteri- nary staff, the sanctioned cadre remaining at the figure of 226 with which the previous year closed. Sanction was given during the year to the addition of four Inspectors and ten Veterinary Assistants who have been appointed on or after the 1st April 1922. GENERAL. 16. Mr. Quirke was Chief Superintendent throughout the year and Government is indebted to him and his whole staff and particularly those named in his report, for a thoroughly satisfactory year's administration. Mr. Quirke's report is most useful and suggestive. Mr. C. A, H. Town- send, I.C.S., was in charge as Director for the year and to his unfailing energy the Department owes much. Mr. S. M. Jacob, I.C.S., who has been officiating for Mr. Town- send, has supplied an interesting note on the year's Veteri- nary progress. The statistical tables at the end of the report should be overhauled and much of the detailed statistical in- formation omitted in future. In any case greater accuracy should be insisted on. As presented Table XIV shows that in the case of certain fairs animals were sold, which were not actually present at the fair. The value of the returns would
6 be increased by the addition of the totals of the preceding year or two years for purposes of comparison. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, E. R.. ABBOTT, Financial Commissioner & Secretary to Government, Punjab (Development Department). No. 718NOTE ON VETERINARY PROGRESS IN THE PUNJAB DURING 1921-22 BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, PUNJAB. I HAVE few remarks to make on matters of detail, as I was not in charge as Director for any part of the year under report. The new four years English course leading up to the Diploma of Licentiate in Veterinary Practice, Punjab, was commenced in October 1921, and as a result, only 29 students were admitted as against 80 admitted in 1920 and 81 in the previous year. Most of the diminution in the number of students is due to the absence of any military can- didates or candidates from provinces other than the Punjab. By adopting the Matriculate standard for admission, and in requiring a four years course of study, we appear, for the moment, to have set too high a standard; and young men, who might have contemplated entering the Veterinary College have apparently decided that it is not worth their while to undergo such a lengthy preparation for the very moderate emoluments which Veterinary Assistants and Inspectors are at present drawing in Government employ. It is true that the grades of Veterinary Assistants which in 1918 stood at Rs. 30, 40 and 50 have been raised to Rs. 60, 75 and 90 respectively, i.e., nearly double the original rates of pay, but the rates of pay are much below those of comparative careers in other Government depart- ments and are, therefore, unattractive. It seems certain that Government will never consent to allow such a splen- didly equipped college as the Punjab Veterinary. College, Lahore, to do no more than educate a score of students each year at a cost approaching 2 lakhs per annum; and the only alternatives, therefore, appear to be either to raise the rate of pay in the Veterinary Department or to adopt the retro- grade step of returning to the old 3 years Vernacular course. There can hardly be any doubt as to which alternative is the more desirable. Another point which I would like to note in connection with the College is that practically no research work has been done there. As the College laboratories have a splen- did equipment and exceptional material to work on, this is a matter which makes one think very seriously, and can hard- B
2 ly be dismissed by the explanation of the acting Principal, that no original research could be completed on account of changes in the staff. I have more than once emphasized previously, and I do so again, that a Veterinary College should reproduce the spirit of the Academe and not that of the Agora. Veterinary Science has a future before it, where- as Veterinary Art must fade into the limbo of Cheirurgy and Alchemy. 2. As to district veterinary work, Mr. Quirke continu- ed as Chief Superintendent for the whole year, and I leave his report and that of his subordinates to speak for themselves in all matters of detail. The primary work of the depart- ment is the treatment of disease and attached to this note is a statement showing the reported mortality in the pro- vince of each year since 1911-12. I am afraid, not much value can be attached to the absolute value of the figures, though they probably afford an indication of the relative intensity of the diseases from year to year. For example, the question that naturally arises in one's mind is as to the actual causes of cattle mortality. Seeing that the total population of bovines and equines together in the Punjab amounts to some 15½ millions, the deaths among them must amount to not less than 1½ million annually. As the reported causes of death annually account for under 40,000 cases of mortality, the question naturally arises, whether the remaining 1,460,000 animals die of infantile diseases and senility. It is clear, of course, that we know very little of the real causes of cattle mortality. The statement shows that the year 1921-22 was the healthi- est, as regards Equines, of any year since 1911-12, while as regards Bovines, the percentage deaths from contagious dis- ease was greater than in any year of the last 11 except 1919- 20. The whole question of cattle mortality, bound up as it is with the question of cattle insurance which the Co-operative Department has been trying to introduce, is one which re- quires investigation by a competent man. As to cattle breeding, the most important event is the set-back which the Department received owing to the resig- nation of the expert recruited in England within a few weeks of his arrival in the country, owing to what he de- scribed as the 'chaotic' conditions prevailing. Mr. Woolf and I had already drawn up, in consultation with Mr. Walter
3 Taylor, a list of the measurements which would be desirable to make on Punjab cattle. Measuring instruments had already been ordered from Europe and I had great hopes that the biometric cattle survey would be able to start in the winter of 1922. These hopes have been stultified by Mr. Woolf's departure and I am now considering in what direction we can look for an expert to replace him. My impression is that to attract the right type of man, we may have to offer double the salary given to Mr. Woolf. Gov- ernment should make it quite plain that it can permit no 'vested interests' to interfere with its determination to obtain a scientific and impartial examination of the Punjab cattle-breeding question. I need not reiterate all the problems of cattle types, cattle breeding, and of cattle economics that require study for any comprehensive scheme of agricultural development, and until they have been examined, I must continue to remain sceptical, not of the energy and enthusiasm for cattle breed- ing of the officers of the Civil Veterinary Department of the Punjab, but as to the direction in which that energy and enthusiasm are leading us. In one respect, I note that the propaganda work by Mr. Wm. Smith, the Imperial Cattle Breeding and Dairying Expert, has called attention to the importance of milking qualities and the arrangements made by the Chief Superintendent for milk tests of the Jahangir- abad cows is a step in the right direction. These tests to be satisfactory should cover the whole period of lactation. 3. Mr. Branford was in charge of the Hissar Cattle Farm up to the 20th of March since when Mr. Sewell has been officiating. Mr. Egan, I.C.V.D., has been appointed Assist- ant Superintendent with effect from 6th of April. S. M. JACOB, The 2nd August 1922. Offg. Director of Agriculture, Punjab. B2

5 Annual report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1921-22. Gazetted Staff. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., O.B.E., Principal and Professor of Medicine, remain- ed in charge of the institution up to 12th February 1922 (afternoon) when he proceeded on combined leave for 4 months and 16 days prefixed to college vacations, except for from 10th June 1921 to 30th June 1921, when he was on a short privilege leave and Captain Sewell officiated for him. Mr. W. Taylor, M.R.C.V.S., D.V.H., Professor of Path- ology, went on leave out of India on 7th June 1921 (after- noon) prefixed to college vacations. Mr. W. Taylor, Pro- fessor of Pathology, took over the charge of institution, in addition to his own duties, on 13th February 1922. S. Mool Singh, Clinical Assistant, Equine, is holding the charge of the post of the Professor of Equine Medicine, in addition to his own duties, from 13th February 1922. Captain Sewell, M.C., Professor of Hygiene, was on deputation to Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, from 21st March 1921 (afternoon) to 23rd May 1921, to conduct certain feeding experiments, and from 11th March 1922 (afternoon) to officiate for Mr. R. Branford who has proceeded on com- bined leave for 8 months. Captain U. W. F. Walker, M.C., Professor of Surgery, remained in charge of the hospital throughout the year. Captain K. J. S. Dowland, Professor of Parasitology, was deputed to work with the Camel Specialist, Sohawa, during the college vacations, and is holding charge of the duties of the Professor of Hygiene since 11th March 1922 (after- noon) in addition to his own duties. Khan Bahadur Syed Sardar Shah took over the charge of the Professor of Bovine-Pathology on his return from Medical leave on 11th June 1921, relieving Pandit Janki Nath, who returned to the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, as Deputy Superintendent. Sardar Hardit Singh, B.Sc., on his return from Eng- land was appointed Professor of Anatomy on two years' probation from 1st October 1921.
6 Non-Gazetted Staff. 2. Chaudhri Haq Nawaz Khan, Clinical Assistant, Canine, was deputed to England for the B.Sc. honours degree course in Phy- siology at the London University, from 1st November 1921, and Lala Durga Dass is officiating for him, and S. Riaz-ul- Hassan's services were obtained from the Civil Veterinary De- partment, Behar and Orissa, to take over the duties of Lala Durga Dass. M. Ghulam Safdar Khan was appointed Lecturer in Che- mistry and Science from 1st August 1921. Mr. C. L. Bhatia, B.Sc., was appointed Lecturer in Bio- logy from 16th January 1922. M. Qamar-ud-Din, Demonstrator of Anatomy, returned to his duties on August 1st in the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, North Punjab. Sessions. 3. The summer session commenced on April 28th and closed on June 30th, and winter ses- sion commenced on the October 3rd and ended with the close of the year under report. Admission. 4. The scheme for the four years' English course was sanctioned by the Punjab Government, Ministry of Agriculture, in their letter No. 282-S. R., dated 23rd May 1921, and on 1st of October 1921, twenty-nine candidates were admitted to the first year class out of fifty-five Punjab Civil applicants. Military and Army Remount Departments sent no stu- dents. The United Provinces, Central Provinces, and Andaman Governments did not send any candidates for admission to the College. Baluchistan Agency nominated a candidate, but he did not join. Kapurthala State sent a student, but he was unable to cope with the work of the class and therefore left; eight others either did not join or left owing to their inability to cope with the work and now a class of nineteen remains, some of which are progressing very satisfactorily. Under Punjab Government, Circular No. 23729 (Home & Genl.), dated 19th December 1917, one nominated can- didate who had meritorious war service was admitted and is still at the College.
7 Course of Study. 5. First year class was recruited for the four years English Course while the second and the third years' classes were held in Urdu. No post-graduate classes were held. Examination results. 6. Supplementary examinations were held in June as usual and the results are given below:8 In the Laboratories no original research work could be completed during the year under report on account of changes in the staff, continuity and co-ordination being necessary for research work. Buildings. 11. Considerable improvements to buildings have been completed. A small animals' house, experimental pens, two Pneumonia boxes and a syces' shelter have been added. Income. 12. The total income during the year was Rs. 17,863 against Rs. 21,567 last year. The decrease is mostly due to the decreased number of admissions last year. Indian States and foreign Provinces did not nominate any candidates for admission into the College. Expenditure. 13. The total expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 1,69,550 against Rs. 1,41,273 last year. The increase is accounted for by the increase in pay of certain establishments and the rise in price of requisites. General Remarks. 14. The health and behaviour of the students remained satisfactory. The number of students residing in the hostel at the end of the year was 132. The Principal is pleased to record his appreciation of the work done by the staff during the year. A riding class for the first year students was instituted during the year under report. The result has been very statisfactory, all the students passing the riding test before being allowed to present themselves for their professional examination.
9 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1921-22. BY MR. T. F. QUIRKE, M.R.C.V.S., CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT. Part I.10 R. S. L. Kotu Ram, Deputy Superintendent, South Punjab Circle, remained on privilege leave for 2 months with effect from 21st September 1921 to 20th November 1921 . During this period M. Muhammad Jan, Veterinary Inspector, officiated as Deputy Superintendent. M. Talib Khan, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department,North Punjab Circle, proceeded on combined leave for one year (6 months privilege and 6 months on half average pay) with effect from 2lst February 1922 when M. Muhammad Abdullah, Veterinary Inspector, was pro- moted to officiate in his stead. 3. A wholetime Superintendent for the North-West Frontier Province has already been sanctioned by the Secretary of State, but no officer has yet been appointed. The appoint- ment should be filled as soon as possible, as under the present arrangement, when the Department is rapidly expanding, one officer cannot do justice to the work of both Provinces, particularly now that the Dhanni Cattle Breed- ing Scheme is in need of such constant supervision. 4. As usual the Chief Superintendent, Superintendents and the Deputy Superintendents toured in their respective circles in connection with horse, mule and cattle breeding, investigation of cattle diseases, and for the inspection of veterinary hospitals, etc. A special point was made of interviewing district officers and all representative zamindars on the veterinary requirements of their districts. Veterinary Assistants are kept up to date in their work by closely questioning them on professional matters when their hospitals are being inspected. The Punjab Veterinary Journal and other vernacular veterinary pamphlets are constantly being circulated amongst the staff. 5. The Chief Superintendent inspected the following veterinary hospitals outside his own circle:11 All the cattle breeding Farms in the Lower Bari Doab Canal Colony were regularly inspected by him. In com- pany with the Chief Superintendent, the Dairy Expert to the Government of India and the Assistant Director, Mili- tary Dairy Farms, visited the Jahangirabad Montgomery Cattle Breeding Farm and were very favourably impressed with the progress being made in grading up the herd. The Chief Superintendent was deputed to Muktesar Labo ratory to study the application of the Serum Simultaneous method of inoculation against Rinderpest in the districts. He attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture at Pusa and acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. He is also acting as Secretary of the Milk and Ghee Committee which was appointed by the Hon'ble Minister for Agriculture to consider the question of the supply of milk and ghee in the Province. Part II.12 1(a).13 Following on a very close watch of previous inoculation results, an increased dosage of Serum with a minimum of 15 ccs. and a maximum of 90 ccs. for plains animals per 600 lbs. body weight has been introduced in the districts in dealing with actual outbreaks of disease. The virulence of the disease varies so enormously, especially under conditions of severe fodder shortage as have been more or less prevalent for some years past, that it has been found necessary to use a larger protective dose than has hitherto been employed. Foot and Mouth dis- ease14 Preventive Vaccinations.15 II.16 The opening of 15 additional veterinary hospitals during 1922-23 is also anticipated, arrangements for which are in progress. Work at veterinary hos- pitals.17 Simla Veterinary Hospi- tal. 26. The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veterinary Hospital during the year under report were Rs. 10,012 and Rs. 7,546, respec- tively, against Rs. 10,489 and Rs. 7,824, respectively, during the previous year. The surplus of the income over the expenditure was Rs. 2,466 against Rs. 2,665 for the last year The minimum amount that is required to be paid to Government annually (according to the terms of transfer) on account of pay and allowance of Veterinary As- sistant and interest on the initial cost of the hospital plus that on the additional expenditure on buildings at 4½ per cent. is Rs. 3,255 per annum. The net loss to Government was there- fore Rs. 789 against the net profit of Rs. 75 during the previous year. The question of raising the fees and charges of this hospital is being considered in order to cover the increased expenditure of the institution. Part III.18 Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 28. At the close of the year there were 19 bulls enrolled in the Attock District, 15 in the Jhelum District and 12 in the Rawalpindi Dis- trict, or 46 bulls in all. On account of the excellent rainfall in these districts fodder has been more plentiful and conditions generally resumed their normal state after the lengthy period of fodder famine which prevailed there. Large numbers of Dhanni cattle which were taken away from the tract during the fodder famine have since returned whilst many have been sold and taken into other districts. The number of coverings done by these specially selected bulls comes to 4,220 during the year which has been largest number since the starting of the scheme in 1918. With the small staff at our disposa' it is impossible to trace all the progeny of these bulls, though over 2,400 have been registered as now present within the Tract. Satis- factory results are also anticipated from this year's coverings. The Superintendent, North Punjab, reports that economic conditions have been so unfavourable in the Tract that if the present scheme had not been started the breed would have tended to disappear. There certainly is abundant evidence from the zamindars of this area of how keenly they appreciate the systematic efforts which have been made under the scheme to save this famous breed. The constant propaganda work done by the staff working in a compara- tively small area has had beneficial results, more especially in encouraging the retention within the Tract of as many of the best cows and bulls as possible. The small financial assistance which could be given under the scheme together with such help as we were able to provide in organising a supply of fodder during this period also helped considerably in this direction. The experience gained in working a cattle breeding scheme in such a tract points to the necessity for fodder conservation and the formation of reserve supplies of fodder before any headway can be made even in the mere preserva- tion of this very famous breed, for which there is such a demand at fancy prices in the Northern Punjab and North- West Frontier Province.
19 29. The number of approved bulls issued by the Department this year for breeding purposes shows that there is a steady demand for the services of such bulls not- withstanding the very severe fodder shortage which prevail- ed in certain districts about the time of the annual distribu- tion. As noted, however, in last year's annual report it must again be repeated that the number of approved bulls at work is quite inadequate for the needs of the province, so that to effect any appreciable improvement in the cattle breeding situation it will be necessary to largely increase the number of such bulls which find their way into the districts annually. It is hoped that in course of time when these bulls have left their mark on the cattle of the province that more reliance can be placed on the village progeny, mean- while we can only reckon progress on the number of approved bulls employed for breeding purposes in the districts. The Department has a definite policy with regard to cattle breeding which it is steadily pursuing, namely, the preservation and improvement of the indigenous breeds of the province by a process of selection from amongst the best specimens procurable. By the very thorough applica- tion of this policy on the Hissar Cattle Breeding Farm the famous Hissar breed has been established, the progeny of which are so popular throughout the canal irrigated tracts of the province. Likewise for the Hariana, Dhanni and Montgomery breeds, schemes for their improvement are in progress which are merely a duplicate on a large scale through the agency of the local cattle breeders in the villages of what has already been done on the Hissar Farm. The Department is fully alive to the necessity of aiming at breeding higher milk yielding cows in greater numbers than are now available and in the selection of stud bulls the milk pedigree is carefully noted. Our further plans in this direction are largely governed by the staff and funds avail- able for this work. It is intended that all the breeding farms responsible for the:ssue of stud bulls to the distrcts should be given facilities to maintain accurate milk records of the herd cows with a view to more careful selection for milk yield. An arrangement has recently been made by which one of our largest herds of Montgomery cows number- ing 500 will shortly be put under a milking test to be c2
20 conducted by the Assistant Director, Military Dairy Farms; it is hoped that it will be possible to arrange similarly for the other farms. Speaking generally, the improvement in the milking qualities of the Indian breeds opens up no greater difficulties than have already been encountered and successfully dealt with in other countries. The marked improvement in Danish cattle was not due to the possession of any remark- able milk-producing qualities in the foundation stocks, but rather to the ruthless elimination of all bad animals, both male and female. It soon became obvious that to secure the selection of productive dairy stock, evidence of milk yield in the case of cows and of hereditary transmission of milking qualities in the case of bulls was necessary. This can be taken also to be the only course open to cattle breeders in this country, and on the thoroughness with which these measures are adopted, will depend the progress which it will be possible to effect in improving the milking qualities of our Indian breeds. This has been pointed out in a circular issued to all Municipalities and Notified Area Committees in the province. Their attention was drawn to the fact that the majority of the best milch cows and buffaloes in the province are in the hands of residents in urban areas, which so far as efficient breeding is concerned are a direct loss to the province, in that no proper arrangements exist for the covering of these cows. Indents for Montgomery bulls and male buffaloes to be maintained by these bodies were invited, but the response was very disappointing. Shortage of funds was advanced as a cause of their very apparent indifference in helping towards a solution of the problem of milk and ghee shortage which so closely affects them. The following Municipalities have made provision for Montgomery bulls and male buffaloes as suggested:21 breeds of cattle as a paying industry. Reference was made to the possibilities of the famous Hariana and Dhanni Cattle Breeding Tracts acting as a store house of cattle for the rest of the Punjab, where such protection could reasonably be provid- ed and would be almost certain to be appreciated by the inha- bitants, the majority of whom are born cattle breeders. It is quite clear that even the most progressive cattle breeding policy conducted by this Department cannot hope to succeed which attempts to ignore the necessity for such protection. It is to be hoped therefore that zamindars will soon recognise the need for more thorough measures being adopted against the heavy mortality from contagious diseases which is at present strangling the cattle breeding industry of this pro- vince. Relief from the very heavy losses due to fodder famines can only come when zamindars themselves are prepared to finance a scheme on co-operative lines for the conserya- tion of fodder; the producer of the surplus fodder must be guaranteed a reasonable profit on his production. With a view to encouraging the conservation of fodder within the Dhanni and Hariana Tracts I have represented to the Regis- trar, Co-operative Societies, that the reason why so little is attempted in the way of fodder conservation, is, because so many cultivators are in need of ready money when their crops are harvested and cannot afford to lose the first opportunity of converting their surplus fodder into cash. It would appear quite feasible that Co-operative Societies might accommodate such members in consideration of storing their surplus fodder. II.22 Services of stal- lions.23 The following statement shows the number of horse and cattle fairs and shows attended by the officers of the depart- ment during the year under report:24 In addition to the above the following societies have also been started by the Co-operative Department in different districts of the province, the bye-laws of which include veterinary regulations approved by this department:25 There were two vacancies at the close of the year in the lowest grade of Veterinary Assistants. Out of the four Veterinary Assistants that were working in the Military Department at the close of the last year three were released during the year under report. The reversion of one Veterinary Assistant is not anticipated on account of his incapacity for further service as reported by the Military Department. Part V.26 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1921-22. 1. My predecessor Mr. R. Branford was in charge of the Farm until 20th March 1922. 2. Mr. T. G. Egan, M.R.C.V.S., has been appointed Assistant Superintendent, and took over charge of his duties on the forenoon of 6th April 1922. 3. Demand for farm stock continued keen. Total receipts for the year amounted to Rs. 1,30,633. 4. Rainfall for the seventh year in succession was below the average. Famine conditions were acute from April 1st to August 1st, and were complicated by the failure of the usual hot weather rise in the Jumna river and consequent failure of canal supplies and farm hot weather crops result- ing in heavy unforeseen expenditure in fodder. 5. Grazing was available from the beginning of August to the end of the year, but the rain was very local and the heavy fall in October was too late for a maximum growth of grasses, and from January onward grazing was very scanty. 6. Farm crops after canal supplies returned to the normal were very good. The amount of fodder, hay saved, being the largest on record. Canal supplies in the cold weather were very good and the oat crop is above the average in acreage. 7. Fodder in reserve at the end of the year amounted to 32,547 maunds (of 82 lbs. each) as against 11,396 maunds on 1st April 1921. 8. Fodder issued to stock during the year amounted to 121,010 maunds. Of this all, except 22,821 maunds, was farm grown. 9. Owing to pressure of work the bailing of leaves suggested as a reserve in case of famine, could not be carried out. These experiments will be put in hand and carried out next year. It is also proposed to make ensilage from Sheesham leaves (Dalbergia Latifolia). The result of the experiment will be published in due course.
27 10. Last year it was noticed that isolated black oats were scattered throughout the white. These were collected and sown, and as expected proved to be a cross, the F.1 generation consisting of black, brown and white oats. It is satisfactory to note that the resulting black oat obtained is a really excellent oat, full bodied, comparatively thin in husk and with very little beard. Measure for measure it com- pares favourably with oats grown from the best Pusa seed. A ghurra (earthen pot) was taken as a standard of measure and a measure full of the following oats weighed28 enough grass for ordinary grazing. There was no recrude- scence of the disease amongst cattle up to the end of the year. Three cases occurred amongst sheep in February. (b) Contagious abortion.29 Young stock30 15. Cultivation.31 17.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Agri- culture) in the Veterinary Department No. 7182 28,903. There was a slight increase in the case of equines, but among bovines the year was exceptionally healthy until after the Christmas rains when Hæmorrhagic Sep- ticæmia appeared in almost all districts. This disease was responsible for nearly half the deaths recorded The deaths from rinderpest dropped from 23,661 to 6,9363 7. Considerably more progress is reported in cattle- breeding operations than during the previous year. There was a large expansion in the scheme for improving the Dhanni breed in the Attock, Jhelum and Rawalpindi districts and a similar scheme was started in Rohtak and Gurgaon for the Hariana breed. Government contributed to the Dhanni scheme but owing to financial stringency could not afford anything for the Hariana scheme except free maintenance for the young bulls at the Hissar Farm. The public spirit shown by the District Boards mentioned is most creditable to them and it is satisfactory to learn that a marked improvement is already noticeable in the cattle of the Dhanni tract. An increased supply of cattle of these good breeds will soon be required to stock the forthcoming canal colonies. 8. The Chief Superintendent's report contains an account of the cattle-breeding grants in the Lower Bari Doab Canal Colony. They appear to be doing as well as can be expected, and during the year supplied breeding bulls to local bodies for the first time. It is as yet too early for them to be on a commercial basis but the grantees in subjecting their herds to milk tests and recording the milk yields, are going the right way about to improve their stock and establish their reputation. 9. The indispensable preliminary however of a real and widespread improvement in the cattle of the Province is as pointed out in last year's review, a change in the heart of the cattle-owning zamindar. It is here that the application of the co-operation movement in the form of cattle-breeding and cattle-insurance societies promises to be of the utmost value. The owners must be made to learn that it pays to conserve the health and strength of their cattle, and to improve the breed both for ploughing and milking. When the &quot;will&quot; has been produced, a &quot; way &quot; will be found. There is no agency so potent to convert them as co-operation. It is therefore most satisfactory to learn that 21 new cow-breeding societies were founded during the year under report and that the majority are in a strong position financially. 10. Mr. Quirke held charge of the Civil Veterinary De- partment as Chief Superintendent throughout the year, and Government are indebted to him and his staff and particu- larly to those mentioned by him in his report for the excel- lent work they have done throughout a successful year. Mr. Quirke has written an interesting report dealing fully with all matters of importance.
4 HISSAR FARM. 11. The report on the Hissar Cattle Farm is most satis- factory. For the first time for some years the Farm receiv- ed a sufficient rainfall, with the result that grazing was good practically throughout the year, and a substantial reserve of fodder was accumulated. The livestock was remarkably healthy and the Farm enjoyed almost complete immu- nity from contagious diseases. Sales of stock were up to standard and the result of a most successful year was a profit of Rs. 7,192, which would have amounted to Rs. 41,242 if the sales of bulls and donkey stallions to District Boards had been made at full and not con- cession rates. The Quinquennial Valuation Committee met just after the close of the year and their findings will be described in next year's report. Captain E. Sewell, M.C., I.V.S., officiated in charge of the Farm till Mr. Bran- ford's return from leave on November 18th, 1922, and per- formed his duties creditably. Government associate them- selves with the Director of Agriculture's special tribute to Mr. Branford and recognise that the Farm has benefited immensely from his long connection with it. Their acknow- ledgments are also due to the members of the staff specially mentioned by Mr. Branford. GENERAL. 12. Mr. S. M. Jacob, I.C.S., officiated as Director from the 15th May to the 2nd October, and Mr. D. Milne, I.A.S., from the 3rd October to the 18th October, 1922, Mr. Townsend, the substantive Director, holding charge at the beginning and end of the year. Government are indebted to all these officers for their assistance and to Mr. Milne, who is again officiating, for the careful and comprehensive note with which he has forwarded the departmental reports. ORDER.NOTE ON VETERINARY PROGRESS IN THE PUNJAB FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1923 BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, PUNJAB. DURING the year under report, Mr. C. A. H. Townsend, I.C.S., was Director of Agriculture up to 15th May; Mr. Jacob officiated up to 2nd October, and I officiated from 3rd October up to 18th December. Mr. C. A. H. Townsend again took over charge from 19th December and continued up till 14th May 1923. Punjab Veterinary College. 2. The following statement shows the staff on 1st April 1922 and on 31st March 1923 :2 Chaudhri Haq Nawaz Khan, lately Clinical Assistant, who was sent to England in November 1921 originally for a year's course in Animal Physiology and Histology at the Uni- versity College of London, was in London throughout the year under report. He is expected to return in September 1923 and will take up the post of Professor of Physiology at present filled temporarily by Mr. Baij Nath Singh. Mr. Karam Elahi, Assistant to the Professor of Patho- logy and Parasitology, was sent for training to the Molteno Institute, Cambridge, in February 1923, for a year's course of training in Parasitology. On his return he will take up the post of Professor of Parasitology at present vacant. 3. The duties which occupied the attention of the staff during the year may be summarised under the following heads:3 in October 1922, but only 19 students actually turned up to join the classes. Seventeen of these were young men from the Punjab and 2 were sent for training by the Government of the United Provinces. In the previous year, the course started with 29 students, all from the Punjab. The reluc- tance of young men to join the course appears to be due to (a) there being a very large number of men qualified for the posts of Veterinary Assistant out of employment owing to demobilization and retrenchment, and (b) to the emoluments offered to Veterinary Assistants already employed by the Department being too low to induce young men to undergo the four years' training. As regards the first point, the Principal notes that re- cruitment to the services is practically in abeyance at present ; that it is not known when the Army authorities will re-open their ranks, and that there is little or no demand from other quarters. This however is recognised as but a passing phase due to financial stringency, a strong staff of Veterinary Surgeons being essential for preventing the ravages of disease among India's vast stocks of domestic animals. As regards the second point, Government has effected an improvement. Up to the time of the admission to the college in the year under report, the three grades of Veterinary Assistant in the Department carried salaries of Rs. 60, 75 and Rs. 90, respectively, but in May 1923, a notice was issued by Government stating that a proportion of more highly qualified Veterinary Assistants would be recruited for the local. Veterinary Department in future, that practi- tioners who took the revised course in English at the Punjab Veterinary College and obtained the diploma of Licentiate in Veterinary Practice (L. V. P.) will be eligible ; that these men will be designated Veterinary Assistant Surgeons on appoint- ment and that they will be paid at the rate of Rs. 1004 act a good deal on their own responsibility in many cases, and nothing will gain the confidence of the farming community more quickly than a correct diagnosis and treatment of cases of illness among their live stock. That there is much room for improvement in this direction and consequently for saving money to the Province is shown by the fact that there is yet very little private practice in the Punjab for Veterinary Surgeons. The same thing is also indicated in Mr. Jacbb's remarks regarding reported cases of cattle mortality from contagious disease in the last year's report of the Department. By the introduction of this new four years' course, I therefore feel that a definite step in advance has been made. 7. About 66.6 per cent of the students who entered the four years' course in October 1921 passed their examination in June 1922. This the Principal considers satisfactory. Twelve farriers were trained during the year. No applica- tions were received from the Military Department for dressers to be trained during the vacation. The number of students who attended their respective courses in the year under re- port were as follows :5 continued some work on anti-rabic treatment of dogs, and although there is no proof that every dog treated had been bitten by a mad dog, the results got were so favourable that it is considered that this treatment has now passed the experimental stage. Some experiments were conducted with canine surra, but the number of dogs treated was so small that no definite statement as to results can be made at pre- sent. The continuance of experiments on a larger scale next cold weather is warranted however. Captain Sewell, M. C., has carried on some deficiency tests on horses, pigeons and rats, but the work is not yet complete and no statement can be made on the case. 10. No important extensions of buildings were under- taken during the year. The extension of the east wing of the Anatomical Block will be taken in hand in the current year. The completion of the tube well in the college com- pound was delayed owing mainly to transport difficulties in getting a suitable pump and other necessary materials. The Sanitary Engineer to Government, Punjab, is drawing up an estimate for the completion of the work. It is hoped that the improvements recently sanctioned by Government to the existing Hostel will remove complaints of unsatis- factory accommodation for the students. 11. The total expenditure on the institution excluding buildings during the year amounted to Rs. 1,62,078. Of this amount, Rs 16,303 were recovered in hospital and students' fees. Therefore the net cost of the institution was Rs. 1,45,775. In the previous year, the net cost was Rs. 1,51,687. Details of the current year's figures will be found in the Principal's statement No. 1 at page I; In Mr. Jacob's note in last year's report to which the Principal refers the expenditure on building was also in- cluded. 12. The college can take about 50 men a year, but I agree with the Principal that there is no point in turning out of the college more men than are likely to earn a livelihood from the training received there. As will be seen further on in this report, there is undoubtedly an increasing demand from farmers in the Province for Veterinary advice and assistance and there seems to be much room for expansion in this direc- tion. It is also hoped that the demand for trained men from the Army and other Provinces will increase soon. The col- lege must aim at turning out men whose work will command
6 the approbation of the public and to effect this a high equip- ment is essential. For a time at least, it will repay other Provinces in the North of India to send their students for training to the Punjab Veterinary College rather than equip Veterinary Colleges of their own. There is no objection to this on the score of differences in local conditions, as might be urged in the case of an Agricultural College, nor does the medium of instruction stand in the way, as the course is given in English. It seems to me, however, that it is essential to develop the research side of the institution as early as possible, as there is unlimited scope to be nefit the Province by the results of the research. 13. Colonel Walker, C.I.E., and his staff are to be con- gratulated on the rise of the standard of work done in the college in recent years. DISTRICT WORK. 14. District work mainly consists of the treatment of sick animals, investigation and control of animal diseases, cattle breeding and in non-selected* districts horse and mule breeding. For this work the Province is divided into three circles, viz.7 and these two officers are under a Chief Superintendent who is also in immediate charge of the Central Circle. The Superintendent of the Northern Circle also superintends the Veterinary work of the North-West Frontier Province under the direct control and the administration of that Province. For annual report of the Chief Superintendent, please see pages 258 until the areas under the charges of Veterinary Assistants are reduced to what the stationary men are capable of super- vising, as he fears losing touch with those villages not yet served by existing hospitals. In this connection, I may note that when the itinerating system was introduced in 1907, it was intended that it should continue until there was one Veterinary Assistant posted in each tahsil. This stage has been passed, and 174 Veterinary Assistants are now at work in the 115 Tahsils of the Province. By giving itinerating men stationary posts, they ought to be able to do much more good, in and around the villages in which they are stationed, also they will cost Government less in Travelling Allowance. 17. The Chief Superintendent points out that notwith- standing the large increase in the number of new Veterinary Hospitals started within recent years, there remains a very keen demand for a further increase in their number, and this also in the face of our present policy to entertain no appli- cations for a Veterinary Hospital without substantial finan- cial assistance from the public of the locality concerned. I feel that this is a high compliment to the quality of the work done by the Veterinary Department and that the result of converting the itinerating into stationary Veterinary Assist- ants each in charge of an Hospital, will be an increase in the offers of financial assistance from the public to start Veteri- nary Hospitals in villages not yet served. With a view to stimulate promptness in reporting cases of contagious dis- eases, and thereby assisting the Veterinary Department in the control of these, Government allotted Rs. 6,000 for re- wards to Patwaris who distinguished themselves by report- ing such cases. Only Rs. 940 of this money was spent, how- ever, during the year. This is probably owing to the system of rewards being as yet not well-known. It seems difficult to imagine that Patwaris do not want to earn more money. 18. Work done in Veterinary Hospitals has increased greatly since last year, as will be seen from the following statement:9 The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veterinary Hospital were Rs. 10,728 and Rs. 8,443, respectively, against Rs. 10,012 and Rs. 7,546, respectively, during the previous year, i.e., the amount of income over expenditure was Rs. 2,285 against Rs. 2,466 last year. This hospital was handed over to the Simla Municipality in 1907, on condition that it would credit Government with an amount to cover the pay, etc., of the Veterinary Assistant and 4½ per cent. interest on the cost of buildings, the minimum amount to be credited to Government being Rs. 3,459 per annum. When this mini- mum amount is deducted from the past year's income, the hospital shows a loss of Rs. 1,174. In the previous year the loss was Rs. 789. Steps are being taken to increase the hospital charges to cover the difference. 19. The total number of deaths reported from conta- gious disease was 28,907 against 42,244 in the previous year. The year under report was unusually healthy for live stock until the latter half, when following the Christmas rains Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia appeared in almost all districts especially in lowlying areas along the banks of the rivers. Among Bovines, the mortality from this disease was 13,684 against 10,923 in the previous year. One lakh eighty-three thousand six hundred and eight animals were inoculated for this disease against 43,858 in the previous year. The demands for inoculations with Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia serum were such that the budget allotment of Rs. 1,10,000 for serum was found insufficient. This demand is a satisfac- tory indication of the growing faith of the people in preven- tive methods of dealing with disease. It is hoped that the day is not far distant when the people will be so convinced of the efficacy of this treatment that a small charge may be made for the serum used. There was a marked decrease in the number of reported deaths from Rinderpest among Bovines, the number being 6,936 against 23,661 in the pre- vious year. Anti-rinderpest inoculations were performed on 48,213 cattle and 662 sheep and goats as against 132,841 inoculations on cattle in the previous year. Encouraging results have been noted from increased doses of the serum. 20. A census of cattle, sheep and goats of the Province was taken in February 1923. This shows an increase of about nine per cent. in the total number of these animals, details C
10 are as follows:11 stringency many district boards were obliged to cancel their indents. District Boards in the Punjab with the exception of Lyallpur are not in a position to cover their recurring liabilities even with the aid of the regular grants of the&quot; Educa- tion Department. This must greatly hinder the progress of work of the Veterinary Department. 22. The Dhanni Cattle-Breeding Scheme was started in 1919 in the districts of Attock, Jhelum and Rawalpindi. Briefly the scheme aims at the provision Of high class bulls of the Dhanni Breed for District Boards and the subsidisa- tion of approved privately-owned bulls of this breed, by grants from Government to be supplemented by grants of at least a corresponding amount by the District Board concerned. In the year under report, a sum of Rs. 6,750 was sanctioned by Government for the furtherance of this scheme in the districts above-mentioned. There is abundant evidence in the reports of the various Veterinary officers that the scheme is making satisfactory progress and is much appreciated in these districts. At the close of the year there were 27 bulls enrolled in the Attock District, 27 in the Jhelum District and 15 in the Rawalpindi District as against 19, 15 and 12 respectively, in the preceding year. The number of cows covered by these bulls was 4,462 as against 4,220 last year. The majority of the young stock has been retained within the tract. A noticeable improvement has already been seen in the number of well bred cattle now available there and a keen demand exists especially for the better class of Dhanni bullocks. Steps have been taken to start a herd book of the breed. The success of the scheme has led to a demand forits introduction in areas outside this tract. 23. A scheme to maintain and improve the Hariana breed of cattle, the home of which is in Rohtak and Gurgaon Districts, has been started. This breed is famous for its plough bullocks and the tract is very important as a store house of cattle for the rest of the Punjab. The underlying principle of the scheme is the same as that for the Dhanni breeding, i.e., the bulls to be provided by grants from Gov- ernment supplemented by at least a corresponding amount from the District Boards concerned. The scheme received the cordial approval of the District Boards concerned and so keen were they on it that each devoted a sum of Rs. 5,000 for the purchase of young bulls in the year under report. In order to get animals up to the standard required at not too c2
12 great a cost the District Boards of Gurgaon and Rohtak pur- chased 34 and 29 bulls, respectively, of one to two years of age and sent them to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, to be reared till they are fit for issue for breeding pur- poses. No charge is to be made by the farm for the rearing of these animals. A grant of Rs. 10,000 was asked for from Government for the support of this scheme, but owing to financial stringency money could not be provided. It is hoped, however, that the Legislative Council will approve of the scheme and provide money in the next financial year. 24. The Chief Superintendent has given a concise account of the cattle-breeding grants in the Lower Bari Doab Colony. These are doing well and the grantees are recog- nising the necessity for a proper supervision over the many details in connection with animal management which are so important factors in making the farms successful. These farms have not yet been in existence sufficiently long how- ever to make any appreciable effect on cattle-breeding in the Province. In the case of breeding cattle for milking purposes the introduction of the milking test which has al- ready been started at Chaudhri Jehangir Khan's farm is essential and it is hoped that this test will be extended to other farms. Chaudhri Jehangir Khan's farm was visited by Colonel Matson, Assistant Controller of Military Dairy Farms, in company with Mr. Smith, Imperial Dairy Expert, and Mr. Quirke, Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, in April 1922. Colonel Matson reported as follows:13 will help to popularize the cattle-breeding industry in the Province. 26. As regards horse and mule-breeding there were 65 horse and pony stallions and 70 donkey stallions at work in the new selected districts at the end of the year under report as against 60 and 65, respectively, at the end of the previous year. 27. Twenty-one cow-breeding and three sheep-breed- ing societies have been started by the Co-operative Depart- ment. It seems to me that this is a most excellent way in stimulating interest in the breeding of these animals and I am glad to note that they are already having a very good effect in demonstrating the advantages of breeding from selected stock. There are now 38 Co-operative Cattle In- surance Societies in the Province and it is satisfactory to note that the majority are in strong position financially. 28. The statistical tables at the end of the report are being overhauled and we hope to omit certain of them in 1923-24 report. In the meantime table XVI (a) &quot;Return of sheep on the Hissar Cattle Farm&quot; has been omitted. The Chief Superintendent, Mr. Quirke and the Superintendent, Mr. Garewal and Major Sikes are to be congratulated on a very successful year's work. HISSAR CATTLE FARM. 29. The area of this farm is 39,844 acres, of which only 2,008 acres are irrigable by canal. The farm is thus largely dependent on the monsoon for its fodder supplies. In the year under report the rainfall was above the average and grazing was good from the end of June onwards. The fodder in reserve at the end of the year amounted to 51,726 maunds (Maund=82 lbs.) as against 32,547 maunds at the end of the year 1921-22. 30. The main function of this farm is to provide high class bulls of the Hissar breed for the people of the province and it is the only source from which these people can rely on getting bulls which will maintain or improve that important breed of cattle. The majority of the animals are issued to District Boards who distribute them to zemindars free or on easy terms. The farm also supplies a few Montgomery bulls to District Boards; its surplus heifers to cattle-breeding societies, private breeders and Indian States; donkey stallions to District Boards for breeding purposes; merino rams for
14 the improvement of sheep breedings bullocks and mules to the Military Department and others. 81. A comparison of the number of the more important animals issued or sold in the year under report and in the previous year is given below :15 The following statement shows the rates fixed by this Committee and by the previous Valuation Committee of 1918 for animals issued from the farm :16 Colonel Walker who was President of the Live-Stock Sub- Committee for the quinquennial valuation had not been to Hissar since 1912 and was greatly struck by the improve- ments effected in the farm since then and by the very effi- cient way in which Mr. Branford is managing it. 34. The annual audit and inspection note shows that the profit on the farm for the year under report as worked out from the figures given in the books was Rs. 7,192 as against a loss of Rs. 1,16,204 in the previous year. The profit is primarily due to (a) the increase in the value of live-stock raised by the above Valuation Committee in order to coincide with prices prevailing in the market and (b) the marked decrease in expenditure on buildings. 35. Six merino rams were imported from Australia during the year: no fresh blood having been imported since 1915. For the past few years breeding from three-quarter merino rams on half to three-quarter merino ewes has given excellent results as far as wool is concerned. 36. There was little contagious disease on the farm during the year as will be seen from the following statement:17 the comparative freedom of the farm animals from this dis- ease. An account of this method and of its effects in pre- serving the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, from this dis- ease has been published in the Punjab Veterinary Journal for the benefit of the public. Early diagnosis of contagious abortion by means of the agglutination test has been kindly carried out for the farm by the Imperial Bacteriologist at Muktesar and the isolation of infected mares has been con- tinued. 37. Irrigated crops were on the whole good. Captain Sewell, M. C., I.V.S., did further work to demonstrate the value of shisham leaves both as a fresh and ensilage fodder. The provision of fodder in that locality is very important. 38. The planting of shisham and kikar trees was con- tinued and the value of the trees on the farm has now reached about Rs. 75,000. Above 90 per cent. of these trees have been planted since the Veterinary Department took over the farm in 1899. 39. Captain Sewell, M. C., I.V.S., discharged the duties of Superintendent of the Farm with great credit for about 8 months in the year under report. Both he and Mr. Bran- ford, I.V.S., have expresesed their indebtedness to certain members of their staff mentioned in Mr. Branford's report on page 48. I feel that a special tribute is due to Mr. Bran- ford for the extraordinary interest in the Hissar Cattle Farm and the devotion for its welfare which he has shown for many years now. D. MILNE, Offg.

19 Annual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1922-23. Gazetted Staff. COLONEL G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., O.B.E., resumed his duties as Principal and Professor of Medicine on the 2nd October 1922 on his return from leave. Captain Sewell, M. C., on being relieved of the Superintendentship of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, rejoined the College as Professor of Hygiene on the 21st November 1922. Captain Dowland resigned his appointment on account of ill-health with effect from the 1st October 1922. Mr. Baij Nath Singh, M.A., M.Sc., was appointed Pro- fessor of Physiology as a temporary arrangement from the 2nd October 1922. Mr. W. Taylor, Captain Walker, M.C., Khan Bahadur Sardar Shah, M. Ghulam Rasul Khan and Sardar Har- dit Singh held their respective appointments throughout the year, Mr. Taylor acting as Principal, in addition to his own duties, during Colonel Walker's absence, Sardar Mool Singh acted as Professor of Medicine. The professorial staff required for the revised course in English is being appointed gradually as the course proceeds. It is trusted that the facilities generously granted to selected aspirants by Government for training in Europe will pro- duce good results. In the case of Sardar Hardit Singh, Professor of Anatomy, the plan has already been amply justified. Non-Gazetted Staff. 2. Chaudhri Haq Nawaz Khan, on deputation in Eng- land, was given a year's extension for further study in Physiology at Univer- sity College, London and Mr. Karam Elahi, Assistant to the Professor of Pathology and Parasitology, was deputed to the Molteno Institute at Cambridge for a course in Parasitology M. Muhammad Alam was appointed to officiate as a Clinical Assistant in the vacancy thus created. The staff required for the revised course in English is being trained and appointed gradually as required. Sessions. 8. The final year of the vernacular three years' course commenced on May 1st after the annual examinations in April.
20 The first year students of the revised course were examined in June and the new session for the revised course for both first and second year students commenced on October 2nd. Admissions. 4. There were no admissions for the vernacular course as it is not being proceeded with. For the revised course the date for the receipt of appli- cations was May 23rd. Twenty-eight applications were re- ceived but only 9 applicants presented themselves. These were admitted. Thirteen more applications were received later. Of these 8 matured and were admitted. Two students were sent by the United Provinces Government. This unsatisfactory state of things must be attributed to the fact that at the moment there are a very large number of Veterinary Assistants out of employment owing to de- mobilisation and retrenchment. In addition, the conditions and prospects of Government employment are not sufficiently encouraging to attract candidates. They compare unfavour- ably with other services and the existing conditions are discussed by aspirants before they commit themselves to the career offered. The course of study now adopted at the College is cal- culated to produce a class of man with a high standard of education and it is in accordance with the expressed policy of Government. It is necessary to improve the terms of service accordingly and this has been represented. In the meantime recruitment to the services is practi- cally in abeyance. It is not known when the Army authori- ties will re-open their ranks and there is at the moment little or no demand from other quarters. The Punjab Veterinary College can educate about 50 men a year without difficulty, but there is no point in turning out more candidates than can be absorbed. The present position is probably quite transitory but it is nevertheless depressing particularly for the large number of unemployed men. India requires a strong and efficient state veterinary service and the Punjab Veterinary College has exceptional facilities for meeting such a demand. Any retrogression would be most deplorable.
21 Number of Students. 5. The number of students at the College during the year under report was as follows :22 Farriers' Class. 7. Twelve farriers were trained dur- ing the year. Dressers' class. 8. No applications were recieved for dressers to be trained during the vacation. The Hospital. 9. The attendance at the Hospital during the year was :23 of many thousand of cases. In this hospital 321 dogs have undergone the treatment, 13 developed rabies during treat- ment and the number which have developed rabies after con- cluding the treatment is 7, or 2.3 per cent., which shows conclusively that the treatment is efficacious. The figure however, should not be taken quite as literally, nor is the result actually so encouraging, for it must be remembered that many people have their dogs treated after being bitten, because they think the dog which bit them was mad. In a great many cases we have no absolute proof that the dog treated was bitten by a mad dog and it is almost certain that, included in the figures quoted, are, several dogs which were not bitten by a rabid animal so that the very encourag- ing percentage shown above should really not be quite so small. Some small experiments were conducted in connection with Canine Surra, but the number of dogs treated was very small, so it is unwise to make any definite statement at the present stage, especially when the elusiveness of the Surra trypanosome is taken into consideration. Briefly, it was as follows. Two dogs heavily infected with Surra were treated with tartar emetic, in varying quantities, and although about two-and-a-half months have elapsed since the conclu- sion of the treatment, the dogs are still alive and well, whe- ther a permanent cure has been effected cannot yet be said, but it is sufficiently encouraging to warrant the continuation of the experiment on a larger scale next cold weather. Captain Sewell has been carrying out some deficiency tests on horses, pigeons and rabbits with certain success, but the tests have not yet been completed, so that any state- ments in this direction would be premature. Sardar Hardit Singh during the past two years, has been employed in preparing dissected specimens for the anatomical museum, and has prepared sixty-one specimens. Buildings. 11. During the year under report no new works or extensions were undertaken. The proposed extension of the Anatomical Block to provide for a Physiological Laboratory is an urgent necessity and the sewerage scheme, which has been approved, is badly wanted. The tube well which has been under construction by the Agricultural Department since 1919 has not been completed. A new Pharmaceutical Block would be a great asset to the College as the present accommodation is unsatis-
24 factory. Plans and estimates have been prepared but there appears to be small prospect of the scheme being sanctioned and it may be necessary to compromise by endeavouring to improve the existing accommodation. Income and Expenditure. 12. The income from the hospital and students' fee amounted to Rs. 16,303 against Rs. 17,862 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the fall in the number of admissions. The receipts from hospital fees would be considerably increased if, as in other Government institutions, credit by book transfer were given for Government animals treated free. The Dog Hos- pital continues to be considerable source of revenue and further accommodation is desirable. Efforts are being made to avoid bad debts, which amount to a considerable sum, by insisting on cash payments. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,62,078 against Rs. 1,69,550. The net cost of the College therefore amounted to Rs. 1,45,775 against Rs. 1,51,687 last year. Mr. Jacob's statement in his note on last year's report that the cost approached 2 lakhs appears to be misleading. One Imperial Officer has been reduced and the income of the Hospital could be increased by making charges for Government animals and by increasing fees all round. At present the scale of charges is very moderate, and many ani- mals are treated free. General. 13. The health and behaviour of the students were satisfactory. A greater interest is being taken in athletics and success has been already attained in inter-club contests. The Hostel is not a very satisfactory habitat but the best use is being made of the existing accommodation pending expected improve- ments now under the consideration of Government. The Principal is pleased to record his appreciation of the work done by the staff during the year.
25 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1922-23. BY MB. T. F. QUIRKE, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT. Part I.26 of the staff were deputed for training with the Camel Specialist, Sohawa, others were sent to the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. The Chief Superintendent made regular inspections of the various dairy and cattle breeding farms in the Province. He attended the second meeting of the Veterinary Confe- rence held at Calcutta and acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. Part II.27 Anthrax.28 With greater confidence the mixing of the inoculated with affected animals is now resorted to during outbreaks in order to secure for them an active immunity. This marks an ad- vance towards the adoption of the serum simultaneous method of inoculation as a routine measure in dealing with this disease. The latter method being still on trial in the Military Dairy Farms we are obliged to act with extreme caution in adopting this method under village conditions. Foot and Mouth Dis- ease.29 measures in dealing with contagious diseases, especially for this disease Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia which invariably runs such a rapid course under village conditions. With this object in view, vaccination work is being extended as far as possible with the staff available. Attention is drawn to the very considerable increase in the number of animals vaccinated, which constitutes a record for this Department. The very favourable results from vaccination were particularly noticeable this year, in that very few cases of this disease have been detected amongst vaccinated animals although our vaccination work is so far confined to well-known areas where the disease is more or less endemic. The Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, has also recently confirmed the reliability of the vaccine as a prophylactic against this disease on the Farm. Black-quarter.80 II.31 Thus at the close of the year there were 173 hospitals in the Province. Work at Veterinary hospitals.32 fore Rs. 1,072 against the net loss of Rs. 789 during the pre- ceding year. Arrangements are being made to raise the charges of this institution in order to cover the increased cost of maintenance and make the hospital at least self- supporting. Hitherto there has been some local opposition to suggestions made in this direction. Abolition of fees charged at rural Veterin- ary Hospitals. 24. In certain districts the levy of fees was either un- popular or the amount of fees collected did not cover the cost of collection, con- sequently the abolition of fees was re- commended to Government. Government has recently sanc- tioned the abolition of fees in Veterinary Hospitals of the Province where the local controlling body so desires. This sanction applies to Veterinary Hospitals located in towns having a population of less than 50,000. The District Boards are however, entitled according to their discretion, to abolish fees charged at Veterinary Hospitals except in the towns of Lahore, Amritsar, Multan, Rawalpindi, Ambala, Sialkot, Jullundur, Ferozepore and in Simla (as a special case). Part III.33 The demand for stud bulls this year by zamindars was well maintained, though on account of financial stringency, many District Boards being unable to entertain applications were obliged to cancel their usual indent. It is satisfactory to note, however, that the total number of stud bulls issued to districts this year was well up to normal, chiefly owing to the large indent received from the Gurgaon District and ex- pansion of the Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. Hariana Cattle Breed- ing Scheme. 26. The Hariana Cattle Breeding Scheme to which reference was made in last year's report has been well received in the Hariana Tract and promises well for the future. It marks the beginning of any serious effort towards the development of the natural resources of the Hariana Tract, as a cattle breeding centre, and as a business proposition the scheme should commend itself to the attention of Govern- ment. The new irrigation works now in course of construc- tion will increase considerably the area of cultivable land in the Province for which plough bullocks will be required in large numbers. The importance therefore of developing the Dhanni and Hariana Cattle Breeding trac s o meet the requirements of the rest of the Province will readily be ad- mitted. Since the majority of the present irrigated districts are not by any means self-supporting as regards the plough bullocks they need, they are dependent on such tracts for the superior type of bullocks which are available there. This source of supply needs therefore to be encouraged where the cattle breeding industry can for economical reasons prove most remunerative to breeders. To meet local prejudices, a number of specially selected young male stock have been purchased by the District Boards of Rohtak and Gurgaon in the Hariana villages and sent to the Hissar Farm to be reared until fit for issue as breeding bulls. Meanwhile the Gurgaon District Board, as already noted, has distributed 116 stud bulls in the district, part of the cost being advanced in each case by the applicants. A survey having been made of the bulls ordinarily employed for breeding purposes in this district, it was found that a large number were quite unsuitable stud animals, these were re- placed by bulls purchased from the Hissar Farm. Zamindars in the Hariana Districts are fully alive to the advantages of developing the cattle breeding industry to meet the demand of other districts for better class bullocks34 societies by the Co-operative Department is therefore part- cularly opportune, which it is hoped will be of considerable help towards the success of the scheme. I wish to acknow- ledge here the readiness with which the District Boards of Rohtak and Gurgaon have adopted the scheme and the very considerable encouragement they have given since the scheme was started. Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 27. At the close of the year there were 27 bulls enrolled in the Attock District, 27 in Jhelum District and 15 in the Rawalpindi Dis- trict as against 19, 15 and 12, respective- ly, in the preceding year. The total number of bulls working under the scheme at present is 69, which shows an increase of 23 new bulls during the year. The number of coverings done by these bulls was 4,462 as against 4,220 last year. Results from last year's coverings have been very satisfactory, the majority of the young stock being retained within the tract. With the continuance of good harvests the scheme has become well established in the tract and has popularised the work of this Department throughout these districts. As far as funds permit the number of subsidised bulls has been increased in order to serve a greater number of villages where the need for good bulls exists. The District Boards of Attock, Jhelum and Rawalpindi, testify to the excellent effect which the scheme has had in the encouragement of cattle breeding and to the very noticeable improvement in the number of well-bred Dhanni Cattle now available in the tract. A keen demand exists especially for the better class Dhanni bullocks which find a ready market at very favourable prices. A preliminary survey of the tract having been com- pleted, steps are now being taken to start a herd-book for this breed as a very necessary step towards maintaining the purity of this breed in future. To make a beginning, it will be necessary to offer some inducement to the owners of re- gistered stock to abide by the conditions which need to be imposed in the interests of the breed. The District Boards concerned have been addressed on the subject. It is hoped that as soon as finances permit effect will be given to the re- commendations made. It may safely be said that owing to the absence of railways and other ready means of communi- cation with this tract, the Dhanni Breed of Cattle more es- pecially as found in the Tallagang area is one of the purest
35 indigenous breeds in this Province. Conditions are there- fore exceptionally favourable for the revival of this famous breed and provided the necessary staff and financial support are available it should be possible to make considerable pro- gress. This statement however, needs to be qualified with the proviso that ample fodder storage against the constantly recurring fodder famines will also be made. It is noteworthy that the marked success of the scheme within the tract has led to a demand for its expansion in out- side areas. The Superintendent, North Punjab, reports its adoption in the Mianwali District bordering on the Tallagang Tahsil where a nucleus of the Dhanni Breed is in existence for many years. Cattle Breeding Grants. 28. As part of the programme for the improvement of cattle breeding in this Province, farms to the number of eight have been given on lease by Government to grantees on cattle breeding terms. Provision has been made on separate farms for the Hissar and Montgomery Breeds of cattle as detailed below36 In addition, two dairy farm grants have been allotted37 developing these farms is, firstly, their want of experience in up-to-date methods of animal husbandry and, secondly, the extra expense entailed, for which at the present prices of cattle ruling in this country, the grantees cannot always foresee an immediate return. As noted in last year's report, the herd on the Jahangirabad farm is being put through a milking test, cream being despatched daily to the Lahore Cantonment Military Dairy Farm. The grantee is gaining valuable experience and appreciates the necessity for maintaining reliable milk records in order to grade up his herd and so establish a name for his farm. The remaining herds are also being brought under the milk test. The grantees realise the commercial value of re- cording the milk yield of their cows which enables them to weed out unprofitable animals from their herds. The Hissar- bred cows, though wild and unmanageable at first, are with extra care and attention rendered more amenable. A start has been made on the Hissar breeding grants of tying up cows as they come in milk and recording their milk yields through- out the lactation period, it is hoped that in time these herds will be rendered more docile and that the best milkers can be ascertained with more precision in future. I believe that with proper care the Hissar breed can with advantage receive more attention in the matter of selection for milk yield amongst the herd cows without any danger of reducing the value of the progeny as plough animals. We are therefore pursuing the development of the farms on these lines. Small beginnings have naturally to be made on account of the additional expense involved in the extra handling and management required. II.38 Total number of mares covered by donkey stallions during the year under report was 3,242 as compared with 3,622 in the previous year. Within recent years there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of mares kept for breeding purposes in the districts. Feed and keep of stallions.39 attended by the Officers of this Department during the year under report:40 Sheep-Breeding Societies. Attock District .. .. .. 1 Jhelum District .. .. .. 2 Th experience gained by members of these societies by complying with the rules of membership is having an excellant effect in demonstrating the advantages of breeding from selected stock. Arrangements are being made for the sale of well-bred heifers from the breeding farms to these societies at favourable rates. The Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, has made definite offers to members of such societeis who are anxious to purchase pedigree stock at favour- able rates. Part IV.41 Part V.42 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm Hissar, for the year 1922-23. The Farm was in charge of Captain E. Sewell, M.C. I.V.S., from April 1st to November 18th and under my charge for the rest of the year. 2. Mr. T. J. Egan, I.V.S., joined the Farm for training to fill the vacant post of Assistant Superintendent on April 6th, 1922. Mr. Woolf who was specially brought out to India to carry out the proposed Biometric survey of the cattle of this Province, was attached to the Farm from 15th April 1922 till June 5th, 1922, when he resigned and returned to England. 3. The Quinquennial Valuation Committee met at the beginning of April 1923 to value live-stock, machinery, fodder, land, etc. 4. Rainfall was above the average, but the growth of grass was rather disappointing and not much hay was made. Probably the periods between falls were too long for maximum growth. However, early rain in June was sufficient to pro- duce grazing, and was of great benefit on this account. Graz- ing was good from the end of June till the end of the year under report. 5. Canal supplies were very good except for the Farm Sully Minor, supplied by Sirsa Branch of the Western Jumna Canal, in which the supply for some unexplained reason was bad in the rabi season. 6. Fodder in reserve at the end of the year amounted to 51,726 maunds as against 32,547 maunds of 82 lbs. each) at the end of 1921-22, i.e., fodder saved exceeded the amount consumed, by maunds 19,179. Another favourable monsoon would allow of a substantial reserve being again accumu- lated. 7. Live stock.43 The following were issued or sold:44 For the last few years we have been breeding from ¾ merino rams on 2/3 and ¾ ewes, with excellent results, so far as the wool was concerned. Up to date the wool has shown no tendency to revert to country type. Punjab breeders still seem to expect the farm to supply a flock of ewes with each ram. This is of course impossible. They seem unable to realise that they will obtain their cross bred ewes for themselves much cheaper by crossing cross bred rams on the country ewes. The following were issued during the year :45 The policy of early diagnosis by means of the aggluti- nation test kindly carried out for the farm by the Imperial Bacteriologist at Muktesar and isolation of all infected mares begun in January 1922 has been continued. The isolation of so many animals for such long periods is inconvenient and expensive but if we can eventually stamp out the disease should prove economical. Our difficulty in this connection is the fact that several new mares purchased last year proved to be infected, indi- cating that the disease must be very common in the Province. No doubt much more valuable information will result from the Imperial Bacteriologist's present investigations of this very serious disease. (c) Black-quarter.46 by a local timber dealer. As about 90 per cent. of these trees have been planted since the Civil Veterinary Department took the farm over in 1899, the value is of course rapidly appreciating. The present value is about Rs. 75,000. Mr. Read, the Farm Bailiff, worked throughout the year with his usual enthusiasm. The following two tables show the weight and value of crops received from the cultivation and Bir during the year:47 10. Experimental Work.48 As usual the Farm Staff worked to my satisfaction. Captain Sewell stated that he was especially indebted while officiating to loyal and untiring assistance from the Deputy Superintendent, Sayad Ghulam Hussain, and 2nd Farm Over- seer, M. Atta Muhammad, a statement I can endorse. The First Overseer, M. Muhammad Ashfaq and the office Head Clerk and the Accountant worked very well. 12.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government, Ministry of Agriculture, in the Veterinary Department, No. 226-D., dated the 17th January 1925. READ2 Veterinary Science in the Province by Khan Bahadur Sayad Sardar Shah, who retired from the Professorship of Bovine Palhology on 1st January 1924, after 34 years of devoted service at the College. DISTRICT WORK. 3. The year has been on the whole a healthy one, although there has been a large increase of over 10,000 in the number of deaths reported from contagious diseases, particularly from Rinderpest and Hæmorrhægic Septicæmia. The number of inoculations and vaccinations however, fell considerably; this was not due to any opposi- tion on the part of the villagers, but largely to the immo- bility of the staff owing to the revised regulations regarding travelling allowance. This has also had its effect in re- ducing by 47,866 the number of animals treated by the staff in their villages. As a consequence as many as 65,130 more animals were brought into the Hospitals for treatment. But as the Director rightly points out treat- ment in Hospitals cannot afford to farmers the same protec- tion against disease among their live stock as touring by the district staff. In an unhealthy year the consequences of this reduction in protective work might be very grave, and the question is one that calls for consideration. Very satis- factory progress has been made in the treatment of Surra, which till recently was regarded as incurable; the results of the further investigation, which is being made by the Sohawa and Muktsar staffs, will be awaited with interest. A revival of the scheme for rewarding patwaris for prompt reports of outbreaks of contagious disease is recommended by both Mr. Branford and Mr. Milne, and it is intended to make some provision for this in next year's budget. 4. There was small increase of 7 Veterinary Assistants, and 3 more Hospitals were added, making a total of 176. Touring was, however, considerably restricted owing to the cut in travelling allowance already mentioned, as was an- ticipated in last year's review, with the result that there was avery large fall in the number of villages visited and cases treated. The number of castrations performed is, neverthe- less, considerably greater. The introduction (in the first instance by Mr. Cross, lately Camel Specialist at Sohawa) of the Italian Burdizzos' castrator has proved very successful and has rendered the operation much easier to perform and more popular with the villagers.
3 5. Cattle-breeding, depending as it does on funds pro- vided partly by Government and partly by local bodies, has been somewhat hampered by the financial stringency of the past few years, but the Gurgaon District Board has shown what can be done if local bodies will only realise the enor- mous importance of the industry to the welfare of their districts. This District Board is to be congratulated on its efforts in this direction. It is satisfactory to see that there are signs of progress in the interest aroused in cattle-breeding operations, which has been stimulated by the efforts of the various Societies orga- nised by the Co-operative Department, The Dhanni cattle- breeding scheme continued to make good progress and has become very popular. The Hariana scheme however was handicapped by the lack of funds from Government, but a satisfactory beginning has been made with funds provided by the Rohtak and Gurgaon District Boards 6. Mr. Quirke held charge as Chief Superintendent during the year. The interesting report on the work of the Department was written by Mr. Branford, who officiated in Mr. Quirke's absence on leave. The Department is to be congratulated on a successful year's working despite the many handicaps. The retirement on 14th February 1924 of Deputy Superintendent Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram on pension after a long and exceptionally useful service was a serious loss to the Department. HISSAR FARM. 7. Mr. Branford was in charge during this year, which is the most successful in the history of the farm. Rainfall above the average and well distributed resulted in 62,392 maunds of hay being saved, a figure 3 times that of the previous record, with the result that a substantial reserve of 134 730 maunds is now in hand. The live stock have done exceptionally well and been free from contagious disease except for an unfortunate recrudescence of equine contagious abortion. The total value of the live stock has increased by over half a lakh of rupees. No mules were taken by the Military Department and the whole question of the continuance or discontinuance of mule-breeding at the Farm is now under the consideration of Government. The annual audit shows the profit on the Farm to be Rs. 31,496, but in addition to this sum remissions on account of sales
4 of animals at privileged rates to local bodies, etc., amounted to Rs. 67,852-12-0. Government is indebted to Mr. Bran- ford and his staff for his efficient management of the Farm and the excellent results achieved. The thanks of the Ministry are due to Mr. Milne, Director of Agriculture, for an interesting and instructive report. ORDER.TABLE OF CONTENTS. Para. Subject. Page.

Note on Veterinary Progress in the Punjab for the year ending 31st March 1924, by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab. DURING the year under report Mr. C. A. H. Townsend, C.I.E., I.C.S., held charge of the post of Director of Agricul- ture up to 14th May 1923 and I have officiated as Director of Agriculture since then. PUNJAB VETERINARY COLLEGE. The report of the Principal of the Civil Veterinary College will be found on page 26. The following statement shows the staff on 31st March 1923 and 31st March 1924:2 STAFF ON 31st MARCH 1923. STAFF ON 31st MARCH 1924. Post Name of Officer. Poet. Name of Officer. PROVINCIAL-CONCLD. PROVINCIAL3 report. During his absence his work was done by Mr. W. Taylor.4 Short Courses5 standard of education is below that which will enable them to deal successfully with the subjects included in the course. The results of the examinations of the 1st and 2nd year classes of the L. V. P. Course held in June 1923 were as follows:6 Parasitology as well as his own. Further, the total amount of teaching work in the College has increased since last year owing to the fact that the 3rd year class of the L. V. P. Course was opened, and the staff had to prepare the lectures, teaching material, etc., for these classes as they developed. I look forward to the time when some more research work will be done as there is undoubtedly great scope to benefit the province by research work and I regard it as a very valuable function of the institution. Alterations and additions have been made to the anato- mical block of the college building, and have resulted in an excellent Laboratory for Biological and Physiological work which fills a long-felt want in the college. Improvements are badly needed in the accommodation for teaching Chemis- try, Physics and Pharmacy. Administrative approval has been obtained for certain improvements in this connection and it is hoped that money for the work will be forthcom- ing soon. The income for the year from hospital and students' fees amounted to Rs. 16,618 and is an increase of Rs. 315 over that of the previous year. The expenditure on estab- lishment, contingencies, etc., was Rs. 1,60,352 during the year under report and was less than that of the previous year by Rs. 1,726. Setting the total income of the in- stitution against the total expenditure (excluding buildings) its net cost for the year was Rs. 1,43,734, this being Rs. 2,041 less than last year. The Principal refers in his report to comments which have been made on the high cost of the college to Govern- ment per student. The obvious cause of this is the small number of students at present in the college and the reasons for this are given by the Principal on page 29. As factors in the case he mentions7 (c) the former starting pay of Rs. 60 for Veterinary Assistants which was too low to attract men of the Matriculation standard to take the 4 years' course. The withdrawal of the Military students was a severe blow as it not only reduced the number of entrants by half, but it also withdrew the provision of posts for these men when they were trained. The retrenchments in the Army which caused the withdrawal cannot continue indefinitely and we hope that we will soon again have some men to train for the army. Advances in the use of mechanical transport will, however, tend to reduce the number required for the army. As stated in my last year's report, I regard the sub- stitution of the 3 years' Vernacular Course by the 4 years' English Course as a definite step in advance. The men who enter the English Course have a much higher general education when they are taken into the college, and the course is far more thorough than the one it replaces. Con- sequently this must lead to a higher class of work from the men when they leave college. Veterinary Assistants have to act a good deal on their own responsibility and nothing will gain the confidence of the farming community more quickly than a correct diagnosis and treatment of of cases of illness among their livestock, or, to put it the other way, nothing will hinder development of the Veteri- nary Department and of private veterinary practice more than the letting loose of badly trained Veterinary Surgeons among farmers. Since Government made the announcement in May 1923 that L. V. P. of the Punjab Veterinary College will be eligible for posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Veterinary Department on salaries of Rs. 1008 equines and 150 lakhs bovines, and over 80 lakhs sheep and goats and the number of cases of reported deaths from con- tagious diseases (admittedly much below actuals) is this year over 39,000 animals. These casualties valued at the low figure of Rs. 50 per animal, works out to a loss to the Pro- vince of about 19½ lakhs of rupees for the year. With the headway that the Veterinary Department is making, and the rapid spread of agricultural education which is taking place among rural people of every province in India, through the medium of schools, farms, agricultural colleges, etc., I feel that there must rapidly arise a great awakening to the need for properly trained Veterinary Sur- geons to be stationed throughout the land. Again there is a call for Indianisation of the Veterinary, as well as of other Services, and as every Indian Matriculate who may wish to join the service has not got money enough to enable him to go to England or elsewhere for a Veterinary training it is of importance to develop a suitable course in India to enable Indians to get into the higher posts. There are three other Veterinary Colleges in India (e.g., at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay), but the Punjab Veterinary College is the only one with a course of 4 years' instruction and conse- quently it has an excellent foundation for the education re- quired. I therefore feel that the present is only a tem- porary check in the development of the Punjab Veterinary College. The Principal reports that the health and behaviour of the students have been good. He also records his apprecia- tion of the work of the staff, and in recommending this to the notice of Government I wish that his work may also be acknowledged- From practical experience I know that when courses are being developed for which there is no local precedent, a good deal of time, originality of thought, and ability are required, and as he is a Professor of an important subject as well as Principal, I have no doubt he had his full share of the work to do. DISTRICT WORK. A most interesting report on district work written by Mr. Branford who is now officiating as Chief Superinten- dent will be found on page 31. The division of the province into circles remains the same as last year, there being 6 districts in the Northern
9 Circle plus the North-West Frontier Province; fourteen dis- tricts in the Southern Circle and nine districts in the Central Circle. As previously the Northern and Southern Circles have each an Imperial Officer 10 At the end of the year under review the complete sanc- tioned cadre of the Department for district work was as follows:11 of the Italian Burdizzo's castrator. The operation takes only 30 seconds approximately to perform and, as it is bloodless, it is becoming very popular even amongst the most orthodox of Hindus. This is a most valuable achievement as it is obviously well nigh impossible to effect marked improvement in the quality of the cattle of the province, while large numbers of undesirable males are allowed to run at large among the better bred females, The increase in the number of castra- tions seems to me also to indicate that awakening of the farming community to the great importance of breeding from better class animals only, which I have already referred to. The total number of animals treated in veterinary hospi- tals during the year under report was 496,072 against 430,942 in the previous year; and the number supplied with medi- cine but not actually brought to the hospital, was 80,289 against 103,832 in the same periods, i.e., the staff treated 65,130 cases (15 per cent. approximately) more and suppli- ed medicine to 23,543 (22 per cent. approximately) cases less than in the previous year. The marked rise in the number of cases treated may be due in part to the growing popularity of the Civil Veteri- nary Department, but it is, I think, also partly due to the reduced travelling allowance keeping the staff at their hos- pitals. The dispensing of medicine to cases not brought to hospital is not encouraged, and the more constant presence of the Veterinary Assistants at their hospitals also, I think, accounts in great part for the decrease in the number of such cases12 number of animals treated by the staff exceeds that of the previous year by 17,264 (i.e., 3 per cent. approximately) inspite of the serious reduction in Travelling Allowance. Comparing the years ending 31st March 1922 and 31st March 1923, however, in the same way the increase in the total number of cases treated was 89,345 (i.e., 19 per cent. approxi- mately) and taking into consideration the 5 per cent. increase in the number of Veterinary Assistants that year and other factors which might effect the case, the crippling effect of the reduction in Travelling Allowance in the year under report appears to have been considerable. Inspite of the facts that fees are only charged from people who are liable to pay income-tax, and that under recent orders of Government no fees are charged for treatment in small rural hospitals nor in such urban hospitals as are situated in towns with a population of less than 50,000 pro- vided the local body in control desires their abolition, the income from hospital fees rose from Rs. 18,919 in the last year to Rs. 21,301 in the year under report. Many hospitals are still accommodated in hired and temporary buildings, but it is hoped that as the finances of the Distirct Boards concerned improve, suitable buildings belonging to the District Boards will be provided. In order to relieve District Boards of the heavy expenses of building veterinary hospitals at out-lying places on the former standard plan, steps are being taken to prepare a plan for buildings on cheaper lines. The receipts from the Simla Veterinary Hospital during the year under report were Rs. 11,138 and the expenditure was Rs. 7,880 against Rs. 10,728 and Rs. 8,443 respectively during the previous year. The surplus income to be credited to Government by the Municipal Committee was, therefore, Rs.3,258 against Rs. 2,258 last year. The minimum amount that is required to be paid to . Government annually under the terms of transfer of the institution on account of the pay, etc., of the Veterinary Assistant and the interest on initial cost of buildings is Rs. 3,459 per annum. The net loss to Government was therefore only Rs. 201 against Rs. 1,174 last year. Certain economics in expenditure were introduced during the year which it is hoped, will quite wipe out this insignificant loss in future. It may be pointed out also that if we take into account the income and expenditure over the whole 17 years in which the institution has been under the
13 Simla Municipal Committee, Government has made a profit on it of Rs. 3,346. During the year under report 39,394 deaths from contagious diseases were reported against 28,907 in the pre- vious year ; i.e., an increase of 10,487 deaths. Among bovines there was an increase of 5,171 deaths from Rinder- pest ; 6,992 from Hæmorrhægic Septicæmia and 779 from Black Quarter. Contagious disease was rather less prevalent among equines and others, than in the previous year. The staff were only able by various methods of preven- tive inoculation to protect 268,775 animals against contagi- ous diseases, this being 43,813 less than in the previous year. Also only 131,380 bovines were vaccinated against Hæmorrhægic Septicæmia which is 39,564 less than last year. The reduction in the numbers of inoculation and vaccination was due to the reduction in travelling allow- ance. The number of vaccinations done for Black Quarter, however, increased by 5,953 over the previous year and reached a total of 15,776. Farmers are now getting much more keen on the Black Quarter vaccinations, twenty-six ponies and five donkeys were treated for Surra at the Sheikhupura Veterinary Hospital. Of these animals, five ponies and three donkeys were cured totally. Mr. Branford reports that the increased mortality from contagious disease was partly due to increased virulence of the outbreaks and partly due to the cut in travelling allowance. He also states that inoculations against Hæmorrhægic Septicæmia could not be performed in many outbreaks partly owing to the late receipt of patwaris' reports. In this connection, I agree with Mr. Branford that the system of rewarding patwaris for prompt reports of such cases, which was tried in 1922-23 ought to be given a more extended trial. In the face of these difficulties as regards travelling allowance I think, that the members of the Veterinary Department are to be heartly congratulated on the amount of work done to combat contagious disease. Fortunately, the year under report was a fairly healthy one for stock, but we must consider what would be likely to happen with the Department so greatly immo- bilised by drastic cuts in travelling allowance in a year when outbreaks are more virulent ; for it must be
14 remembered that the combating of infectious disease is done largely on tours. At the departmental meeting to consider the develop- ment of the Agricultural, Veterinary and Co-operative Departments held in April of this year, I drew attention to the large number of Veterinary Assistants and Veterinary Hospitals which must be added before we could have hospitals at distances of ten miles apart in the province and Mr. Branford in the report now submitted also draws attention to the present state of affairs. He points out that the total number of cattle, sheep and goats in the province amounts to over 23 million (see also page ten of last year's report) and that there are roughly 175 Veterinary Assistants at work in the districts ; therefore that each Veterinary Assistant has to look after the health of over 30 thousand of these animals ; also as the area of the Province (excluding Native States) is well over 90,000 square miles, the animals under each Veterinary Assistant are scattered over an area of over 500 square miles. Had the year been an unhealthy one for stock, the result would have been disastrous. And who would have been the victims? Obviously the farmers in the first instance and to by far the greatest extent. But as already stated agriculture is the basic industry of the Punjab and cattle are the backbone of agriculture so that the province as a whole would have been greatly affected. Is it then economic for the province that the travelling allow- ance of this department should be reduced to a point which hampers the mobility of the district staff ? The whole tra- velling allowance of the Vetreinary Department omitting that provided for the staff of the Veterinary College and the Hissar Cattle Farm which amounted to as much as Rs. 74,000 (round) in 1922-23 dropped in the year under report to a grant of only Rs. 39,720 (round) till November when an additional Rs. 9,440 were given making the aggregate allotment Rs. 49,160. I have no reason to doubt the sympathies of either the public or the Government but I feel sure the situation is not correctly appreciated in many quarters, and I think it is important that the matter be care- fully considered. The question is, is it worth while to give farmers adequate protection by the Veterinary Department against disease among their live-stock?
15 While on the subject of tours I regret to have to point out that, with the little travelling allowance that was allow- ed, some of the officers of the Veterinary Department have not spent as much time in village touring as they should have done. The work of the Department lies in the villages and it is essential that its officers shall do a good deal of village touring. We cannot, however, expect men to face the discomforts of touring unless the expenses involved are fully met. The cattle-breeding work was carried on and developed as far as possible on the lines indicated in previous years' reports. At the close of the year under report there were l,774 stud bulls at work in the various districts of the pro- vince against 1,637 last year. The departments' activities with regard to cattle breed- ing depend upon funds which are partly contributed by Government and partly by local bodies. The financial con- ditions both of Government and of these bodies in the past years has undoubtedly made it difficult to find money to encourage this industry, but I agree with Mr. Branford that a factor in the case is that most local bodies do not yet appreciate the great importance of cattle breeding to the welfare of their districts. Gurgaon District Board is a notable exception and although a poor board has in the past year supplied to its farmers 110 bulls at one-fourth of the price it paid for them. To help to provide money for this purpose, the District Board has levied bull cess of two pies per rupee on the land revenue and 2 annas per rupee on the Hasiyat tax. This District Board is to be congratulated on its efforts to improve the local breed. There is little doubt that other District Boards could do a lot more in this direction also if they really care to do so. In view of the fact that the funds of District Boards come mainly from zamindars it is expected that most of these funds will be spent in the development of agriculture, to which cattle breeding can contribute so much. A good many District Boards in the Province derive handsome in- comes from their cattle fairs, vide Table IX on pages xviii16 District Board is commended to the notice of other District Boards. I think that it would also be a great help to the development of cattle breeding if, as Mr. Branford suggests, District Boards would set aside for a number of years some percentage of their funds for this purpose, so that a definite programme of expansion could be adopted by each dis- trict. Mr. Branford, I think, indicates a real obstacle to the improvement of breeds of cattle in this country as compared with that work in other stock-breeding countries when he says : &quot;There would appear to be none of the social prestige attached to the breeding of high class cattle amongst our large land-owners such as is in other countries&quot; and like him I consider that the formation of cattle breeding societies will help to remedy this defect. Such societies tend to foster competition for the ownership of the finest animals, etc., etc. Cattle Shows should also have a beneficial effect. In the canal-irrigated tracts at present, farmers find that the cultivation of crops pays them better than the rearing of cattle, and for this reason there is a considerable amount of apathy to be faced as regards cattle breeding in such quarters, but considering the prominent part which cattle play in the production of crops in the Punjab and the extra demand for cattle which must arise when the new canals begin the function, I feel sure it will repay farmers to take a real interest in cattle breeding operations. Signs of progress in this direction are not wanting I am glad to say. The Dhanni cattle breeding scheme continues to make very satisfactory progress. The underlying principle is that bulls are to be provided by grants from Government, supplemented by at least a corresponding amount from the District Boards concerned. In the year under report Gov- ernment contributed Rs. 6,500 towards this scheme. At the end of the year it had 91 bulls at work as against 88 at the end of the previous year and the numbers of cows covered by these bulls were 7,157 and 4,462 respectively, in the same years. A herd-book for the Dhanni breed has been started by the Department: also a Dhanni Cattle Breed- ing Association has begun to work in the Gujar Khan Tahsil of Rawalpindi District, and promises to do well. The assistance of M. Talib Khan, Deputy Superintendent, Northern Circle, in this connection, deserves mention. The
17 Association has collected subscriptions to the amount of Rs. 650 for the carrying on of its business. Unfortunately, owing to the prevalence of plague in that tract, only one cattle-show could be held. This was held at Jatli in the Rawalpindi District, and was very successful. The Dhanni Scheme 'is very popular in its tract and it is interesting to note that the Sardar of Kot Fateh Khan in Attock District has started a small cattle-breeding farm of his own which is well commented on. The Hariana cattle-breeding scheme, which is worked on the same principles as the Dhanni breeding scheme, was, I regret to say, handicapped by no Government funds being provided for it during the year under report. As mentioned in previous year's report, the district boards of Rohtak and Gurgaon, however, in accordance with their resolutions allotted funds for this purpose and a fairly satis- factory beginning has been made. At present there is some difficulty in procuring really suitable bulls for it, and young ones have to be bought. The system of early castrations prevalent in the locality accentuates the difficulty referred to when young animals have to be chosen as defects only appear when the animals grow up. This difficulty will decrease as records of the parentages of the young animals to be selected accumulate, i.e., the risks of selecting inferior young animals will become less as the pedigrees of the parents become better known. The district board of Rohtak proposed to purchase 15 bulls of the local breed, 5 bulls from Nagor and 5 from Sheikhawati: both of the latter places are in Rajputana. The Board has been advised by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, and by the Chief Superintendent not to introduce the Rajputana strain as this is contrary to the original scheme which Government agreed to start. I thoroughly agree with this view and hope the Board will confine itself to purchasing bulls of the Hariana breed. I regret to say that both the Dhanni and Hariana cattle- breeding schemes are suffering for want of staff. Schemes of this sort entail a good deal of extra work, e.g., in checking coverings, recording results of coverings, etc., etc., and the regular veterinary staff in areas concerned are to be congra- tulated on the results already achieved. The Multan District Board has started a cattle-breed- ing society 18 puty Commissioner there. The programme of this society includes the improvement of all classes of livestock and the encouragement of all measures to that end. As regards cattle, the Association has started somewhat on the lines of the Dhanni scheme and subsidises selected zemindari bulls for breeding purposes by a monthly premium of Rs. 10 for each selected bull. The bulls will be selected at local fairs, etc., and reserved for breeding purposes by the owners who will receive the monthly subsidy. This association has collected Rs. 1,500 from the tahsil of Shuja'bad alone and has already done very good work in the district. The subsidy system of keeping privately owned bulls for cattle breeding has also been introduced in the district of Mianwali by that district board. The private cattle farm which Malik Ahmad Khan Dhandala, a zaildar in the Bhakkar Tahsil of Mianwali district, started in 1913 continues to be maintained by the owner. He has now got a stock of about 300 cows of the Montgomery, Dajal and Zar breeds. Two bulls, one of which is the Dajal breed and the other of the Montgomery breed, are working on this farm. At the end of the year under report there were in the province19 majority of these farms have reached their full strength of cattle. Of the two breeds of cattle (i. e., Hissar and Montgomery) concerned, the latter has made most progress, and can show some good specimens of its kind. Before the establishment of these farms, good animals of this breed were becoming extremly difficult to find. Milk records are now kept in some of these farms and the grantees are beginning to appreciate the great value of these records when attempting to breed cattle which will give improved milk yields. Through the enthusiasm and perseverance of Syed Muhammad Hussain, a colony of small cattle-breeding holdings ranging from a half to two rectangles each has been started near Shergarh (the home of the Sahiwal breed of cattle). The lessees are Janglis and Syeds of that neighbourhood and have to maintain two approved Sahiwal cows per rectangle. Many of the cows so far collect- ed are unusually fine animals. The progress of cattle breeding on these small holdings will be watched with great interest as the beginnings indicate that this may turn out a better method of stimulating cattle breeding than by making the much larger cattle breeding grants which have been made in the past. I regret to say that the lessee of the Sir Louis Dane cattle farm near Kaliana has taken little or no interest in his grant. The Montgomery and Lahore Dairy farms are still too new to make much comment upon. Little has been done so far in the matter of buffalo breeding. Municipal Committees who should be interested in the question appear to be apathetic. With all the disabilities which the department has to face I am of the opinion that the progress made in cattle- breeding during the year has been very satisfactory. As regards horse and mule-breeding, I may mention that the Palwal and Ballabgarh Tahsils of the Gurgaon Dis- trict were transferred to the Army Remount Department c2
20 for this purpose. These Tahsils have been added to the &quot;selected&quot;* districts. Consequently two horse and two donkey stallions were transferred to that department reducing the sanctioned scale of horse and donkey stallions for non-selected districts from 73 and 82 to 71 and 80, respectively. At the close of the year there were 62 horse and pony and 76 donkey stallions in non-selected districts compared with 65 horse and 70 donkey stallions last year. The province is at present short of 9 horse and 4 donkey stallions, but funds are being arranged to meet the cost of their replacement. The total number of mares covered by these stallions were :21 fee is also being brought to the notice of the other District Boards. This seems to me to be another indication of the awakening of farmers to the value of breeding from good animals only. I sincerely hope that substantial additions will be made to the district staff of the Department, and that sufficient money will be provided for travelling allowance in order to enable the department to cope successfully with outbreaks of contagious disease and other important work which it is carrying on for the good of the agricultural com- munity. I feel that congratulations are due to the staff of the Department for the excellent work its members have done in the face of the many and exceptional difficulties which they had to contend with in the year under report. In view of the fact that Major Sikes is about to leave the department, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the excellent work he has done for the province through- out the four years he has served here. He has been a steady, sound and energetic worker and has greatly improved the tone of the work in his circle. I wish also to gratefully acknowledge the assistance given to the Department by many district officers during the year under report. Hissar Cattle Farm22 Civil Veterinary Department took the farm over in 1899. More hay could have been saved but for an epidemic of Malaria and Dengue fevers in the autumn which seriously affected the labour supply. Canal supplies were on the whole good throughout the year, and it is gratifying to note that the farm has now a substantial reserve of dry fodder in hand. This reserve amounted to 134,730 maunds on 31st March 1924 as against 51,726 maunds on the 31st March 1923. In addition the farm has a good deal of ensilage which has been in pits for two years and is of very good quality. On account of good rains and consequentey of sufficient grazing the condition and growth of stock during the year under report was satisfactory : cattle having done excep- tionally well. The table below gives the number of the more import- ant animals sold in the year under report and in the pre- vious year :23 The Superintendent states that the financial returns from sales of donkey stock for the year were poor owing to the fact that Army Department refused at the eleventh hour to take over 7 jacks which they had indented for at the beginning of the year. In this connection, the Director of Remounts in his letter of 26th February stated that &quot;in view of the issue of Government orders for retrenchment it has been decided to reduce the complements of donkey stal- lions in the horse-breeding areas of the Army Remount De- partment and therefore it would be impossible for the Army Remount Department to purchase any donkey stallion from the Hissar Cattle Farm that year.&quot; The Civil Veterinary Department will make use of these animals elsewhere. The Superintendent regrets that financial regulations prevent such animals from being sent off to fill existing vacancies in the Government stallion cadre maintained by District Boards in non-selected districts of the province. Since his report was written, Government has issued instruc- tions that provision for the purchase of donkey stallions from the Hissar farm should be omitted from my budget in future, and that such transactions should be simply shown in the pro formâ account which the farm maintains. No mules were issued to the Military Department dur- ing the year under report, owing to the change of system of issue and the rise in the price of these animals recommended by the Quinquennial Valuation Committee of 1923. We are in correspondence over this case. The mules are still on the farm. The farm stock of sheep continues to flourish and to be profitable. The demand for cross-bred (merino X desi) ewe lambs continues to exceed the number that can be supplied. Cross-bred lambs got by mating the pure Merino rams im- ported from Australia in 1922 with the pure desi ewes are very promising. Arab horse-breeding is doing well. One Arab stallion was issued to the Gurdaspur District Board and one young stallion will be ready for issue next year, but will probably be retained on the farm as he is an exceedingly fine and highly bred animal.
24 Three more colts will be ready for issue in the forth- coming year and all promise to be better than majority of the so called desert Arabs available in the open market now-a-days. Eight foals were born during the year. As regards contagious diseases, I am glad to note that inspite of the unusually heavy rains the farm was again completely free from Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Attempts have been made to rid the farm of this fell disease by rou- tine vaccination of the calves born, and if the disease has been eradicated, as those incharge of the farm begin to hope, it is a great achievement. There was unfortunately a serious recrudescence of equine contagious abortion in- spite of early diagnosis and isolation of the stock. Mr. Branford now acting as Chief Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, is taking up the matter with the Director of the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar. Details of the cases of contagious diseases are given below:25 A complete statement of the return of the animals on the farm at the end of the year under report is given by Mr. Egan, officiating Superintendent of the Farm, in Table XII on pages xxiv26 Annual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1923-24. Gazetted Staff. 1. COLONEL G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., O.B.E., V.D., resum- ed his duties as Principal and Professor of Medicine on the 1st of October 1923, after his return from leave, which commenced from 3rd May 1923. During Colonel Walker's leave Mr. Taylor officiated as Principal and Sardar Mool Singh acted as Professor of Medicine. Captain Sewell resigned his appointment with effect from 19th November 1923. Khan Bahadur Sayad Sardar Shah retired from his ap- pointment with effect from 1st January 1924. This Officer served the College meritoriously for 34 years. He held the post of Professor of Bovine Pathology, and during his service wrote several text-books for use in the College and also pamphlets on cattle breeding, cattle diseases, etc., for distri- bution amongst Zamindars. Sardar Hardit Singh was confirmed in his appointment as Professor of Anatomy with effect from 1st October 1923 in the Provincial Service. Kh. Karam Elahie was appoint- ed on probation with effect from 1st January 1923 as Pro- fessor of Parasitology in the Provincial grade. Sardar Mool Singh was appointed on probation for two years with effect from 1st July 1923 as Professor of Phar- macology in the Provincial grade. Ch. Haq Nawaz Khan on his appointment on probation for two years with effect from 20th August 1923 as Profes- sor of Physiology in the Provincial grade after his return from England relieved Mr. B N. Singh temporarily appoint- ed last year. Mr. W. Taylor, Captain Walker and Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Rasul Khan held their respective appointments throughout the year. Urgent representations have been made requesting the immediate appointment of a specially qualified Officer to take Captain Sewell's place, but up to the present the ap- pointment is vacant. As a result of this there has been a serious break in the continuity of the 3rd year course, and it has been necessary
27 to omit temporarily the important subject of Hygiene in- cluding milk and meat inspection from this course, while in the time which ought to have been allotted to Hygiene, a more extensive course has been given in Pathology. An attempt will be made to give the Hygiene course next year to those students who ought to have had it this year, pro- vided that a suitable Officer is forthcoming in time. It is anticipated that difficulties will be encountered in securing the services of a suitable qualified Officer on the salary offered, as it is a post requiring special knowledge. Non-Gazetted Staff. 2. Sheikh Faqir Ali, Professor of Hygiene, retired from Government service with effect from 21st June 1923 on medical certificate and the services of M. Abdul Wahid Khan were obtained to replace him. Vernacular Course. 3. Eleven men who had failed in one subject only in the last examination were examined in June 1923 and passed. There were only eleven failed students in third year class vernacular course who were examined in March 1924, four of them passed, three having failed in one subject only will be re- examined in June next. English Course admissions. 4. Ninety-four candidates applied for admission in the first year class of the English Course and 37 were admitted. One F. Sc., Medical Faculty group, was also admitted. Three students were sent by the Mysore State. Number of students in the College. 5. There are :28 The results are shown below :29 Income. 11. The income from the Hospital and students' fee amounted to Rs. 16,613 against Rs. 16,303 in the previous year. Expenditure. The expenditure was Rs. 1,60,352 against Rs. 1,62,078, the net cost being Rs. 1,43,734 against Rs. 1,45,775 last year. 12. From time to time questions have been asked refer- ring to the cost per student at the College The reasons for the increased cost are not far to seek. Until three years ago it was customary for half the vacancies in the College to be reserved for Military students. There was never any diffi- culty in filling these vacancies. For the past three years the Military authorities have not sent any students at all, thus cutting down the numbers by half. In addition to this when the course was changed from Vernacular into English it was also changed from a three to a four years' course, and the standard of Entrance was raised to the Matriculation, whereas in former years there was no definite standard, and many of the students had had practically no primary training. Also having raised the standard of the training, the Government did not raise the scale of pay after qualification, but it remainded on the former scale of Rs. 60 per mensem, so that for the first two years very few students applied for admission. Several of these left the College during the first year on account of not being able to compete with the work. It was not to be expected that a student under the new conditions would put in four years' work at the College with the prospect of obtaining Rs. 60 per mensem after qualifying. The result was that a poor class of students was obtained who had probably failed to gain admittance to other Colleges whose professions held out better prospects. After two years the pay was raised to Rs. 100 per mensem. The immediate result was that there were ninety- four applications for 25 vacancies. The cost per student next year will still be high as it is not proposed to admit more than 25 Punjab students as yet. It is useless to fill up the College with students while the ultimate prospect of employment is small, as this will only cause dissatisfaction and future lack of students for admission.
30 The present standard of education in the College is a high one, and in view of the State Veterinary requirements of the country, it is one which must be maintained at the highest possible level. In this respect, owing to the ex- ceptional facilities offered, the Punjab Veterinary College can cater for the whole of India in higher Veterinary edu- cation. The health and behaviour of the students have been satisfactory. The present hostel accommodation leaves much to be desired. It is hoped that the Government will, in the near future, take steps to improve it. The students are taking an increasing interests in games. Cricket has been discontinued on account of com- paratively high cost of its equipment, which would not be covered by the athletic fund fees paid by the small number of students at the College. Also the large majority of students appear to be keener on hockey and football. Two challenge cups are now competed for. One has been presented by Khan Sahib Ghulam Rasul Khan, and is presented to the winners of the Inter tutorial football com- petition. The other is held by the Tutorial group which obtains the most marks in Football, Hockey, Volley Ball and Athletic sports. The members of the staff have worked well, and their efforts are much appreciated by the Principal.
31 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1923-24. BY MR. E. BRANFORD, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., CHIEF SUPERIN- TENDENT. Part I.32 circles in connection with horse, mule and cattle breeding, investigation of equine and bovine diseases, for the inspec- tion of Veterinary hospitals and tonga lines and for select- ing sites for new Veterinary hospitals. 3. Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram retired on superannuation pension with effect from the afternoon of 14th February 1924 and was relieved by Pandit Janki Nath, Deputy Superinten- dent, transferred from the Central Punjab Circle. The retirement of Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram involves the Department in a loss difficult to replace. The Rai Sahib possessed in a marked degree the qualities necessary for a successful District Veterinary Officer, tact, energy and enthusiasm. His experience and knowledge of the Department have been of the greatest help to a succession of Superintendents. The vacancy caused by the retirement has not been filled up so far and it is with great difficulty that Chief Superintendent (whose work and responsibilities are rapidly increasing with the expansion in the activities of the Depart- ment) is doing the work of Deputy Superintendent in addition to his own. 4. Consequent upon the departure on leave of Mr. Cross, Camel Specialist, Sohawa, from April 5th, 1923, the staff of the Sohawa Laboratory were temporarily placed under the Chief Superintendent as an additional charge. 5. Propaganda work by means of lectures and demon- strations was carried out at all the principal fairs. Arrange- ments were made for the attendance of the staff at local meetings of Co-operative Societies with a view to giving popular lectures on the work of the Department. Every encouragement is given to the staff to keep themselves up-to-date in their professional work. It is hoped that in the near future it will be possible to arrange for regular refresher courses and also to utilise more fully the facilities which the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, pro- vides for the training of the staff. 6. The Chief Superintendent visited the following places outs de his own circle in the interests of the Depart- ment :33 He visited Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, twice and office of the Camel Specialist, Sohawa, thrice during the year under report. The following cattle fairs in the North and South Punjab Circles were also attended by him :34 The increase is partly due to the fact that (1) the previous year was unusually free from contagious disease, and probably partly (2) to the Department being largely immobilised by the drastic cuts made in the travelling allow- ance budget. For example we were only able by various methods of preventive inoculation to protect 268,775 animals in the year under report as against 312,588 in the previous year. It is bad business for the Province to maintain a Veterinary Department, mainly to prevent contagious disease at a cost of 14 lacs and then for the sake of saving a few thousand rupees working expenses in the shape of travelling allowance, sacrifice much of the benefits which should be derived from the Department. Examination and collec- tion of Paralogical Speci- mens. 9. During the year under report 506 specimens were received from the subordinate veterin- ary staff for microscopical exami- nation and they all were examined in the laboratories attached to Civil Veterinary Department offices at Lahore, Rawalpindi and Ferozepore. I. (a)35 During the previous year only 14 deaths from this disease were confirmed. The incidence of this disease always varies with the rainfall, but it is of course a much worse scurge than the figures indicate. The disease was most prevalent in selected horse breed- ing districts where equine diseases are under the control of the Army Remount Department. The staff of the Sohawa Laboratory was employed during the Surra season in carrying out the treatment by the drug tartar emetic in Surra infected ponies collected at the Sheikhupura hospital. Details of the results of treatment are given in the report of the Officer Incharge, Camel Special- ist's Office, Sohawa. In collaboration with the Director and 1st Bacteriologist, Muktesar, it is intended to pursue the investigation of a suitable remedy for equine Surra by the employment of natural Surra cases presented for treatment at our hospitals. Dourine36 serum with greater care and in large doses. This no doubt accounts for the excellent results where we were able to use it. Foot and Mouth Disease 37 Black-quarter38 II.39 The District Board of Montgomery has admitted the necessity of starting a new Veterinary Hospital at Chicha- watni in the Montgomery Tahsil but on account of lack of funds have approached Government for the grant of Rs. 20,000 only for the purpose during the year 1924-25. Administrative approval of Government is awaited to the opening of Veterinary Hospitals at : (1) Qilla Sardar Harnam Singh instead of Manan- wala, District Sheikhupura. (2) Indoura, District Kangra. (3) Campbellpur, District Attock. Necessary provision to meet the pay of additional Veterinary Assistants for these places already exists in the budget for the year 1924-25 and it is hoped that the opening of Veterinary Hospitals, will not be long delayed. New Veterinary Hospitals are proposed for the follow- ing places as soon as the necessary preliminaries have been completed :40 generously contributed to the opening of new Veterinary hospitals :41 Assistant and interest on the initial cost of the hospital plus that on the additional expenditure on buildings at 4½ per cent. is Rs. 3,459 per annum. The net loss to Government is therefore Rs. 201 against the net loss of Rs. 1,174 last year. The question of raising the charges of this hospital in order to cover the increased cost of maintenence and make it at least self-supporting is still held in abeyance. Certain economies in the existing expenditure were however suggest- ed which are being acted upon. Abolition of fees at Veterinary hospitals. 30. It is gratifying to note that in spite of imposition of certain restrictions in the way of charging fees at Veterinary hospitals, the income derived during the year under report has shown a perceptible increase, it being Rs. 21,301 as compared with Rs. 18,919 during the previous year. Part III.42 The Department's activities with regard to cattle breeding are necessarily dependant on the funds made available for this purpose either by Government or the District Board. Nearly two years have elapsed since administrative approval was given to the Hariana Cattle Breeding Scheme but the necessary funds have not yet been granted which were to provide the Government subsidy. The District Boards of Rohtak and Gurgaon have however in accordance with their resolution allotted funds for this purpose and under the circumstances a fairly satisfactory beginning has been made in developing the resources of the famous tract in order to meet the needs of the canal irrigated districts for plough cattle. Particular credit is due to the Gurgaon District Board for its sympathetic treatment of the local cattle breeding industry by making it possible to supply at quarter price 110 applicants with bulls specially chosen by them during the year from the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar. The action of this Board is specially commended to the attention of other District Boards which have not yet shown the same appreciation of the economic importance of cattle breeding to their districts. The financial position of the various District Boards makes it a matter of increasing difficulty to find the funds which are needed for the encouragement of the cattle breeding industry. No improvement in this respect can be anticipated until some percentage of District Board funds is allotted to cattle breeding so that a definite programme of expansion can be adopted by each district. It is evident that under the present precarious system of finding funds little real headway can be made in cattle improvement faced as we are with the difficulty of not being able to guarantee even replacement of the casualties occurring amongst the 1,774 stud bulls which comprise the present strength of District Board bulls working in the districts. This is very regrettable in a Province like the Punjab the progress of which is so closely associated with the cattle breeding industry. We may attribute this position to a general lack of appreciation of the economic importance of cattle breeding otherwise it would be reckoned as a key industry and treated as such. The need therefore for extensive propaganda to educate public opinion regarding its importance is urgent. A start has been made in a small way by the formation of a representative society of cattle
43 breeders in the Dhanni tract with a view to organising public interest in the work of the Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme and a similar society is being organised for Hariana cattle breeders. It is felt that the large landowners who can best afford to take a part in the revival of the indigen- ous breeds of cattle are they who have shown least enthusiasm to do so and in this respect differ very re- markably from men of similar position in other stock breeding countries who have been noted pioneers in any movement concerned with the breeding of live stock. There would appear to be none of the social prestige attached to the breeding of high class cattle amongst our large landowners as in other countries, to remedy which the formation of such societies has certain possibilities when they once begin to function properly as breeding societies. It is gratifying to record that another such society was started at the close of the year in the Multan District. Its programme includes the improvement of all classes of live- stock and the encouragement of all measures to that end. Already the society has given a great impetus to the work of castration in the district and is considering the question of the provision and improvement of stud bulls. This so- ciety owes its inception mainly to the energy and enthu- siasm of the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Fyson, to whom the thanks of the Department are due. Hariana Cattle Breeding Scheme. 32. Some difficulty is being experienced in procuring really suitable bulls. This is accentu- ated by the custom of early castration prevalent in the district and the diffi- culty of selecting animals for bulls when in the calf stage. Many develop defects as they grow up, not readily noticeable when they were calves. The Rohtak District Board intend apparently during the present year to utilise the money voted for the scheme in the purchase of mature bulls. It is to be hoped that they will confine their pur- chases to locally bred animals as advised by the Superinten- dent, South Punjab, and not introduce animals from Rajpu- tana as has been proposed. Crossing with bulls from Rajputana will not improve the local breed and is altogether contrary to the original plan of the Hariana scheme.
44 Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme. 33. The Dhanni Cattle Breeding Scheme is making encouraging progress. The number of bulls at work has increased. Seven thousand one hundred and fifty-seven cows were covered by these bulls as against 4,462 last year. A cattle breeding association has been initiated under most promising auspices and a start has been made with a herd book. Unfortunately owing to plague several cattle shows in connection with the scheme could not be held. A very successful show was however held at Jatli in the Rawalpindi District. The scheme like all other Veterinary Department activities is still suffering from lack of special staff and the regular Veterinary staff in the area are to be congratulated in having accomplished so much. The extra work thrown on them in shape of checking coverings, the results of covering the opening of herd book, etc., have been consider- able. Cattle Breeding Grants. 34. The majority of grantee farms have now reached the full strength of their herds and no doubt on the whole progress is being made. The fact that cattle breeding on irrigated tracts com- pares so badly from the pecuniary point of view with any other kind of farming militates against these farms. So long as barani cattle breeding areas still exist in the Pro- vince, from which bullocks can be imported at less than it costs to rear them on irrigated land, cattle breeding on a large scale can only exist in the Canal Colonies under the artificial conditions of these farms and there is no incentive for the grantees to devote more attention to their cattle than the conditions of their leases make imperative. Taking this fact into consideration the present position of these farms as a whole is not discouraging and it is possible that the opening up of further large areas for irrigation may raise the price of plough cattle sufficiently to supply the much desired pecuniary incentive to those engaged in the industry. Of the two breeds maintained on the farms, as was to be expected considering that they are the indigenous cattle of the tract, the Sahiwal breed has up to date made most progress. This is all the more gratifying in consideration of the fact that prior to the formation of these farms it was becoming increasingly difficult every year to purchase good specimens of this breed. The Department has now no
45 difficulty in supplying the existing demand for stud bulls of this breed with good specimens bred on these farms. Milk records are being kept on all the farms and grantees now understand how they should be kept and are beginning to appreciate the necessity for them and how valuable is the information to be derived from them. Milk records are also being very well kept at Kadirabad, one of the farms for Hissar breed, and on all of them pro- gress has been made with the work of gentling and handling cows and heifers with a view to milking and milk recording in the future. The Hissar or Hariana cows with proper handling becomes quite as docile as the Sahiwal. It is a moot point, however, and one that this experiment will do something to solve ; whether the breed will do as well and develop as well under stall feeding as under free grazing conditions. The Shergarh Cattle Farm which owes so much to the enthusiastic advocacy of Syed MohamadHussain Shah, M.L.C., has made a good start. This farm is a colony of small holdings, from ½ to 2 squares of land each, the lessees who are all junglies and Sayads having to maintain 2 approved cows per square. Many of the cows collected up to date by these men are unusually good specimens of the Sahiwal breed. II.46 Government has been approached with a view to find the money to make good this deficiency but up to date the necessary funds have not been provided. This is to be regretted as deficiency in stallion power must lead either to overwork of stallions present or to good mares being covered by undersized, underbred tats and a consequent set back to our horse breeding operations. Service of stallions47 vious year. The animals were as usual paid for in full by the applicants :48 The remaining fairs or shows were as usual either attended by the Veterinary Inspectors of this Department or abandoned on account of the prevalence of plague, etc. VI.49 Societies is being continued and it is hoped that in the course of few years appreciable progress will be made as zamindars come to realise the benefit of these societies. Part IV.50 is so important that no scheme with that end in view should be given up without an exhaustive trial. 45. Owing to financial stringency there is an inclina- tion on the part of certain local bodies to cut down their Veterinary budget. This is a matter for great regret as at present the Veterinary staff of the Province is already ri- diculously inadequate. Considering that the area of the Pro- vince is 97,209 square miles, and according to the corrected cattle census of 1923 the total number of live-stock in the Province comes to 23,333,333, the total number of Veteri- nary Assistants employed purely for field work is 205 (those employed in Civil Veterinary Department Offices, Govern- ment Cattle Farm, Hissar, and the Punjab Agricultural Col- lege, Lyallpur, are not included in the number) allowing 15 per cent. on leave, etc., we have 175 Veterinary Assistants actually at work. It would thus appear that we have only one Veterinary Assistant for every 133,333 animals and for an area of about 555 square miles. 46. The subordinate staff, both Clerical and Veterinary (with few exceptions), have continued to work satisfactori- ly during the year. I wish to bring on record the valuable help rendered by my Head Clerk, Lala Ram Rattan. The following members of the staff are specially men- tioned for the good work done during the year :51 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1923-24. THE Farm was in charge of Mr. R. Branford for the whole of the year under report. 2. Rainfall was above the average, although the rains did not begin till July 8th and finished on August 28th (no rain at all falling in September or October). Mr. Branford remarks &quot;The year was by far the best so far as Bir grazing areas are concerned that I have known. My personal experience dating from April 1911. &quot;This no doubt was due to the fact that between above- mentioned dates, rain fell in just sufficient quantity and at suitable intervals. For about two months the Bir was always moist and never too flooded that is sufficient time in warm weather for our South Punjab grasses to obtain their maximum growth. &quot;As a rule in this tract, in so-called good years, inter- vals between falls of rain are too long. Hot dry winds occur between falls and the grasses are almost always more or less stunted and come into seed too soon; or occasionally rain, when it does come is too heavy, floods out low-lying areas, and sometimes destroys grass germinat- ed in them by a previous fall. &quot;On a moderate estimate about three-fourth of the Bir in 1923 carried at least three times as much grass as I have seen before. 1923, so far as grazing and Bir hay is concern- ed, was a bumper year.&quot; 3. Sixty-two thousand, three hundred and ninty-two maunds (82 pounds to the maund ) of Bir hay were saved. This is three times as much as the record since 1899 (the year the Civil Veterinary Department took the farm over). More hay would have been saved, except for Malaria and Dengue fevers. These fevers were rampart in this dist- rict all the autumn, and very seriously affected the labour supply. Malaria began to be a serious scourge in August, a month earlier than usual. 4. Canal supplies were good throughout the year, except on the Dabra Minor in the first half of the kharif. This Minor, the tail of which supplies the farm is usually E2
52 our best channel, but for kharif 1923 the tail received so little water that we were unable to sow our main kharif crop on the area fed by it till heavy rains came at the end of July. 5. Fodder in reserve at the end of the year amount- ed to 134,730 maunds as against 51,726 maunds (maund= 82 lbs.), on the 31st March 1923, i.e., fodder saved exceeded the amount consumed by 83,004 maunds. The farm now has a substantial reserve of fodder in hand. 6. Bir fires.53 Male stock:54 connection up to date has been the high percentage of butter fat usually found in the farm cows; and of cows listed to date, the most generous milkers have generally been found to have the highest percentage.

Experimental Work.59 (b) The superiority of Formalin over Copper Sulphate as a preventative against smut, at all events in the hands of the ordinary farmer was again demonstrated this year. My intention was to have treated all oats seed this year with formalin, but owing to the supply temporarily running short we had to fall back on copper sulphate for a few maunds of seed only. Areas sown with formalin treated seed were for all practical purposes free from smut. Careful examination of several acres revealed only one affected ear. The area treated with copper sulphate was noticeably affected with smut. Formalin was used in the following proportion:60 30 male produce were castrated. 2 herd bulls were castrated. 11 mules were castrated. 365 cattle were inoculated against Black-quarter. 350 cattle were inoculated against Hæmorrhagic Sep- tieæ mia. 12.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture) in the Veterinary Department, No. 743-D., dated the 19th February 1926. READ2 Principal in regard to the limitation of admissions to the College, as it is obviously economically unwise to glut further the already over-glutted market with trained Veterinary Surgeons, for whom no employment is available or is likely to be available until public opinion becomes much more alive to the need for their services. There are already signs that this awakening is beginning and the support now being accorded to the College by the Indian States is a significant indication of this. Government also is now happily in a position to improve the prospects of the alumni of the college by increasing the staff of the Civil Veterinary De- partment to which 7 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 6 Veterinary Assistants were added during the current year. 4. As regards the hospital work, very satisfactory facts are the increase in the number of out-patients, most of which were Bovines and the confidence engendered in the public by the anti-rabic treatment. The success in the lat- ter line makes it all the more disappointing that paucity of staff and the preoccupation of the existing staff with teaching and supervision have left little time for research work for which as remarked last year the college is so eminently suitable. 5. Colonel Walker's appreciation of the work of the College Staff, and of the good behaviour and keenness of the students is noted. To Colonel Walker himself the thanks of Government are due for the zeal with which he has ad- ministered an important institution. The enthusiasm with which he has introduced and placed on a sound footing the higher course of study now in force, will have far-reaching effects in providing the Punjab with a staff of well-equipped Veterinary Surgeons for the growing requirements of the Province. 6. Civil Veterinary Department.3 45 per cent. in the number of animals treated, cases supplied with medicines and castrations in hospital. The figures in regard to castrations are very remarkable and are, as observ- ed by the Director of Agriculture, of special importance, as they show the great awakening of the peasants to the necessity of improving the breed of their cattle and of the value of castrations as a means to this end. Mr. Quirke, and his staff are to be congratulated on the results achieved. Three new Veterinary hospitals were opened during the year, and the opening of 12 more new ones was contemplated, and the Department is, as noted above, being strengthened to man those hospitals. 7. Nearly 50,000 cattle died of contagious diseases during the year, rinderpest being responsible for 30,000, an increase of 18,000 over the figure for last year; this was to some extent balanced by a reduction of 8,000 in the death roll from hæmorrhagic septicæmia, but the net increase is 10,000. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the number of inoculations for rinderpest increased so largely. It is satisfactory to find that advanced methods of preven- tion are absorbing the attention of the Department more and more every year. 8. The general improvement noticed by the Chief Superintendent in regard to the interest shown by District Boards in cattle-breeding is a matter of great importance, which bodes well for the future, especially if the difficulties of the uncertain fodder supply in the Hariana and Dhanni tracts can be overcome. The question, Government is glad to see, is receiving attention from the Department and assis- tance of great value it may be hoped will be received from the Fodder Specialist in the Agricultural Department In this connection the efforts that are being made to improve the breed of buffaloes also are noted with interest. 9 It is disappointing to find that the various large grantees of land for improving the breed of cattle and for dairying purposes still need to be continually urged on to fulfil the conditions on which they received their grants It is true that wheat and cotton pay much better, but severe action must be taken in all cases where it is established that the grantees have deliberately ignored the conditions of their grant in order to make the larger profits obtainable from wheat and cotton. More reassuring, in view of the im-
4 portance of cattle-breeding and the improvement of milk yields, is the reports regarding the small grants to Syeds and Janglis in the 5,000 acre plot near Shergarh as the Director of Agriculture reports that the animals produced for his inspection were of a very fine type. 10. For the first 8 months of the year Mr. R. Branford, Superintendent of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, acted as Chief Superintendent during Mr. Quirke's absence on leave. To both these officers Government is indebted for the energy and care which they devoted to the supervi- sion of a very strenuous year of advance in the work of the Department. Government also notes with pleasure the names of the officers enumerated by Mr. Quirke, in para- graph 43 of his report, as having rendered specially good service during the year. 11. Hissar Cattle Farm.5 constitutes a record for Hissar. Interesting experiments were also made in the planting of Kikuyu grass and the relative merits of Lucerne (Medicago Sativa) and Berseem or Egyptian Clover (Trifolium Alexandrinum) as green fodder producers. New machines have enabled the staff to stack bhusa much more expeditiously and to facilitate the dressing of wounds and other operations on animals. 14. The report on the Farm is a record of untiring and keenly interested work on the part of the whole staff, which is of very great value both to the Veterinary and the Agricultural Departments. It is, therefore, all the more satis- factory to find from the pro forma account, recently audited, that after allowing for free issues of horse and donkey stal- lions and the concessions for bulls issued to local bodies, there is a profit on the year's working of Rs. 72,487. The Punjab Government (Ministry of Agriculture) congratulate Messrs. Branford and Egan and their staff on a very successful year's working. 15. In conclusion, Government desires to thank Mr. Milne, Director of Agriculture, for a very interesting report, and for his energetic administration of the Department. The more widely extended appreciation of their efforts on behalf of the agricultural population in connection with some of their most important assets, their cattle, their horses and their sheep, must be very gratifying to the Director and his officers. By order of the Governor in Council, C. A. BARRON, Financial Commissioner and Secretary to Government, Punjab, Development Department.
Note on Veterinary Progress in the Punjab for the year ending 31st March 1925 by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab. I held charge of the post of Director of Agriculture during the year under report. Punjab Veterinary College. The report of the Principal of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, will be found on pages 29-36. The following statement shows the gazetted staff of the College on 31st March 1924, and on 31st March 1925:2 On return from leave for two months and 26 days prefixed to the College vacation, Colonel G. K. Walker, C.I.E., O.B.E., F.R.O.V.S., resumed charge of his duties as Principal and Professor of Medicine on 1st October 1924. During his absence Mr. W. Taylor, M.R.C.V.S., Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology, officiated as Principal in addition to his own duties. The post of Professor of Hygiene which has been vacant since 19th November 1923, consequent upon Mr. Sewell's resignation, was filled provisionally on 19th January 1925 by Mr. A. C. Aggarwala, M.R.C.V.S. There were no other changes either in the gazetted or the non-gazetted staff. The duties which occupied most of the time and atten- tion of the College staff may be classified as:3 The Principal states that on the register of candidates for employment, there are still eighty-one names of men who went through the old three years' course, and, as men- tioned above, he has selected only thirty-seven men for ad- mission to the L. V. P. course this year. He has confined admissions to this limit as he considers it would be unwise at present to accept a larger number of men anticipating employment under the Punjab Government. No promise of employment is given to any one entering the Veterinary College, but I agree with Colonel Walker that it is well to restrict to a certain extent the number of entrants to the College, both in order to enable us to select the more suitable men for the course, and to avoid later the discontent of a mass of diplomates who cannot be employed in Government service, and who have otherwise little chance of earning a living from the costly Veterinary education which they would have spent their money on acquiring. As regards the advantages of selecting the entrants, I note from the Principal's report that inspite of the Matri- culation standard of entrance to the course being insisted on, a number of students with that qualification have been found lacking in the requisite mental capacity to cope with the course, and that this accounts for many dropping out during the first year. Regarding employment there is little hope that diplomates could step at once into successful private practice; but as stated in my last year's report, I feel that with the headway that the Veterinary Depart- ment is making, and the rapid spread of agricultural educa- tion which is now taking place among rural people of every province, through the medium of school-farms, agricultural colleges, etc., there must rapidly arise a great awakening to the need for properly trained Veterinary Surgeons to be sta- tioned throughout the land, and with this awakening private practice will, I think, gradually establish itself, provided that the men sent out from the Veterinary College have a sufficient knowledge of their subject. People who have seen the Veterinary College and know something of the four years' diploma course now taught there, are unani- mously of opinion that that course is very thorough and up-to-date, and I hope that the time is not far distant when the services of men who pass through it will be in great request by the public. The Principal of the College states that the Army authorities show no sign of requiring recruits in the future, B2
4 but that Native States are beginning to support the institution, and that developments in that direction may be expected. This support from States is a hopeful indication of the awakening referred to above. We also hope for con- siderable expansion in the Punjab Civil Veterinary De- partment, and possibly in other provinces within the next few years, as provinces are now showing signs of recovery from the financial stringency which has so hampered their expansion for several years back. As regards the 81 men of the old three years' ver- nacular course who are yet unemployed, the Principal states that 39 of these men were trained for the Military Department and were discharged on reduction of establish- ment; also that seven of these are pensioners. In this connection I may note that since the Principal's report was written, we have employed 5 of the non-pensioners in permanent employment as Veterinary Assistants, and seve- ral more have been employed in temporary posts; also that there are proposals under consideration which, if approved, will enable us to employ a considerable number more of these men. The numbers of students in the College at the close of the classes in the year under report were as follows:5 The results of the Annual Examinations of the classes of the L. V. P. course held in June 1924, and the Supple- mentary Examinations held in December 1924 for students failing in one subject, are given below:6 In the General Ward in the year under report, the decrease in the number of in-patients7 Hygiene as an extra subject in their 4th year instead of in their 3rd year as originally intended. This, as stated by the Principal, made the final year harder on the students than would otherwise have been the case. The Principal states that the inauguration of the four years' course in English in the year 1921 has led to consider- able criticism, but the comments on it that I have heard have been usually of high appreciation. The standard of admis- sion, as indicated above, is now the Matriculation examina- tion of the Punjab University or its equivalent, and as stated by the Principal, the aim now is to produce professional men possessing a sound knowledge of veterinary science based on a foundation of logical reasoning: practical work in every branch being a special feature of the course. The fact that the course is in English, places these men in the position that they can utilise the literature of a large part of the world to keep them abreast of the times after they leave College. This is an advantage of great value as practically no current literature on veterinary science is available to the old vernacular men. With the rapid strides which sciences are now making, these vernacular men rapidly fall behind. The L. V. P. course is certainly a great advance on the old three years' vernacular one and should be useful not only for men entering Subordinate Veterinary Services but also as a foundation for the more advanced studies which men must undertake before they can expect to hold the higher posts in Veterinary Department. But although the Veterinary College is at present primarily a teaching institution as stated by the Principal, I look forward to the time when in it, or under its 8 &quot;Dourine&quot;9 progress. For this the Principal and his staff are to be con- gratulated. Colonel Walker is on leave at present, and it is doubtful whether he will return, but we hope to see him back to help to carry on the work of development of the College which he has done so much to improve. District work. The report of the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, will be found on pages 3710 The post of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, North-Punjab and North-West Frontier Province, was held by Mr. Brett throughout the year under report. Major F. G. Sikes was in charge of the Southern Circle till 13th September 1924 when he left the Department. He was relieved by Mr. Garewal who returned from leave in Britain. As regards the Provincial Service officers, M. Talib Khan and Pandit Janki Nath continued to work as Deputy Superintendents in the Northern and Southern Circles, respectively, throughout the year. Kh. Ghulam Hasan was appointed to the vacant post of Deputy Superintendent, Central Circle, caused by the retirement of Rai Sahib Lala Kotu Ram. Kh. Ghulam Hasan took over charge on 6th November. 1924. The control of the Sohawa Research Laboratory remain- ed with the Chief Superintendent throughout the year. As usual the report of the work done there, has been published separately. At the close of the year under report the complete sanctioned cadre of the Department for district work, was as follows:11 animals treated, and the numbers of castrations performed during the year under report, and in the previous year:12 For further details see Table V, pages xii13 the net profit to Government was Rs. 220 against a loss of RS. 201 in the previous year. Three new Veterinary Hospitals were opened during the year under report and of these one at Indaura, Kangra District, and one at Qilla Sardar Harnam Singh, Sheikhupura District, were started by local subscriptions. There is now a total of 179 hospitals in the province. Since the Veterinary year closed, Government sanction has been given to the filling of the 13 posts (7 Veterinary Assistant-Surgeons, and 6 Veterinary Assistants), necessary for the opening of the 12 Veterinary Hospitals referred to in the report of the Chief Superintendent, and Government has allotted Rs. 50,000 to assist District Boards in the construction of buildings for more hospitals. A list of 26 hospitals proposed to be opened by District Boards as soon as staff to open these can be supplied, is given in Chief Superintendent's report. Their cases are under consideration. Standard plans of hospitals have been prepared to meet the various districts' requirements. Regarding contagious disease, 49,493 bovine deaths from this cause were reported during the year, against 39,394 in the previous year. Rinderpest alone is res- ponsible for the increase14 I consider that it is of the utmost importance to the province that the mobility of the district staff should not be hampered. The Chief Superintendent states that the increased dosage of serum now being used is helping to popularise the practice of mixing inoculated, with diseased, animals in affected villages, as a means of actively immunising against this disease. The advantage of this practice is that when animals are injected with serum and immediately exposed to infection they acquire an active immunity of several months' duration. The Chief Superintendent is of opinion, however, that the time is approaching when economic conditions will help to induce the &quot;Serum simultaneous&quot; method of in- oculation as the more effective method of dealing with rinderpest in this country. This method consists of inject- ing the animals with anti-rinderpest serum on one side, and with rinderpest infected blood on the other. The animal gets a mild form of the disease and a lasting immunity is then established. Even when no reaction takes place an immunity lasting several months is established. The method has the disadvantage that a small percentage of deaths occur after inoculation, and that at times it is diffi- cult to obtain the virulent blood from a sick animal. In what is known the &quot;serum alone&quot; method, the animal is injected only with anti-rinderpest serum. From foot-and-mouth disease, 792 bovine deaths were reported against 993 in the previous year. Kangra District, with 214 deaths, had the highest mortality. The usual measures to check the spread of the disease were taken by the Veterinary staff. The Chief Superintendent states that mortality from this disease invariably occurs as the result of complications which are easily preventable when proper hygienic measures are taken by the owners. As regards hæmorrhagic septicæmia, 12,316 bovine deaths were reported during the year, against 20,676 in the previous year. The worst attacks were reported from Shahpur, Sialkot, Lyallpur, Amritsar, Karnal and Rohtak Districts. Preventive inoculations against hæmorrhagic septicæmia were performed in 294 outbreaks and on 84,728 animals, against 314 outbreaks and 82,976 inoculations in the previous year.
15 Hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccinations were performed on 155,527 animals in 566 villages, against 131,380 vacci- nations in 461 villages in the previous year. There is thus a considerable increase of preventive work done against this disease, but the Chief Superintendent points out that vacci- nation to be most effective should be carried out shortly before the rains and that as the staff is often occupied with other diseases at that time, further extensions of these measures will depend to a large extent on an augmentation of the District staff. The number of bovine deaths reported from Black quarter during the year was 2,240 against 1,348 in the pre- vious year. Attock District suffered most and 1,993 deaths were reported from that district alone. Over 400 deaths were reported from each of the districts of Rawalpindi and Jhelum. The losses reported from other districts were small. Vaccinations against Black quarter were performed on 15,842 animals in 91 villages in the year under report as against 15,776 animals in 114 villages in the previous year. The Chief Superintendent states that measures for tae prevention of this disease are likely to be more effective as the result of recent research work done. Personally I think this would be the case in most diseases if research work was undertaken on them, and I think it is very impor- tant that this should be done. Four hundred and ninety-three bovine deaths were reported from contagious diseases such as cow-pox, liver fluke, contagious pleuro pneumonia, gillar, etc., against 310 in the previous year. Two thousand eight hundred and sixteen deaths from contagious disease among other animals were reported against 3,726 in the previous year. Rinderpest alone accounted for 1,201 of these.
16 The following is a summary of the bovine deaths reported and the bovine inoculations and vaccinations performed in the year under report and in the previous year:17 Therefore the province is reported to have lost 10,876 more bovines from contagious disease in the year under report, than in the previous year, and the District Veterinaary staff performed 40,612 more inoculations and 24,213 more vac- cinations on bovines against contagious disease than in the previous year. As regards outbreaks of contagious diseases among equines, this department only deals with those which occur in the &quot;non-selected&quot; districts (see statement at pages ii18 I am glad to note a general improvement in the interest shown by district boards in cattle-breeding. The department attaches very great importance to the development of the Hariana and Dhanni tracts as cattle-breeding centres of the province, as for economic reasons the rearing of cattle should prove more remunerative to breeders there than in the canal irrigated areas. I am therefore glad to note that the District Boards of these two important cattle-breeding tracts have begun to take an active interest in the development of their breeds of cattle. The most serious difficulty faced in these tracts is the uncertainty of fodder supply owing to the constantly recurring famines. The question of improv- ing the fodder supply in these tracts is receiving the atten- tion of the department. In this connection, 1 may men- tion that a much needed Fodder Specialist has just been appointed to the Agricultural Department. As explained in last year's report, the principle of working the Dhanni and Hariana Cattle-breeding Scheme is that bulls are to be provided by grants from Government, supplemented by at least a corresponding amount from the District Boards concerned. The Dhanni scheme now em- braces part of each of the four North-Punjab districts, Attock, Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Mianwali. A part of Mianwali has been added during the year under report. The Government grants-in-aid to this scheme amounted to a total sum of Rs. 8,500 in the year under report. The total number of bulls working under this scheme at the end of the year was 108 against 91 in the previous year. Of the 17 bulls added, three were purchased outright and 14 have been entered on the subsidy system, explained last year. Some 12,290 cows were covered by approved bulls during the year as against 7,157 in the previous year. Calves were got from an average of about 64 per cert. of the cover- ings. This represents a very satisfactory increase in the number of well-bred young stock born in the tract during the year. With a view to enlisting public interest in the scheme, Dhanni Cattle-breeding associations have been started in Rawalpindi, Attock and Jhelum Districts. All these asso ciations have held regular meetings during the year and have collected funds which they intend to apply to the improvement of the Dhanni breed. The Rawalpindi Associ- ation has applied to the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, for registration, and it is hoped that the other associations will do so in the near future.
19 The Hariana Cattle-breeding Scheme embraces the dis- tricts of Gurgaon and Rohtak. In the year under re port a Government grant of Rs. 4,000 for this scheme was divid- ed between the two District Boards concerned. The record number of 110 bulls have been supplied to the Gurgaon District Board from the Hissar Cattle Farm during the year. There are now a total of 391 approved stud bulls at work in that district. Also 24 heifers were supplied from the Hissar Cattle Farm to the Co-operative Cattle-breeding Societies in the Gurgaon District and arrangements are in progress for increasing the number. The department is greatly indebted. to Mr. F. L. Brayne, Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon, for the extraordinary interest he takes in all matters concerning the development of agriculture in his district. The Rohtak District Board has purchased 12 stud bulls from the Hissar Cattle Farm. The District Board is now taking a very active interest in cattle-breeding. The Multan Cattle-breeding Association, started by Mr. Fyson, Deputy Commissioner, Multan, last year is doing very good work. Such District Boards as those of Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura and Lahore also take a great interest in cattle-breeding. There are some others, however, which are still very backward. The following statements show some particulars of the larger grants of lands for the improvement of breeds of cattle in the Punjab:20 The total number of young stock on these farms is 1,000 approximately. For the Montgomery or Sahiwal Breed of Cattle. Name of farm. Year granted. Area in acres. Requited strength of herd. 1. Jahangirabad Farm ... 1916 4,226 8 bulls, 500 cows. 2. Kot Allah Dad Khan Farm 1917 3,800 3 bulls, 125 cows. 3. Sir Louis Dane Cattle Farm, 1910 2,300 3 bulls, 150 cows. Kaliana. Total ... ... 10,326 14 bulls, 775 cows. The total number of young stock on these farms is 1,000 approximately:21 wheat make crop growing far more profitable than cattle rearing, and the grantees in their anxiety to make money rapidly are apt to forget the objects for which the grants were given. In brief a major trouble is that under present economic conditions the interests of the grantees and the Government are antagonistic. A notice has been served on the grantee of the Sir Louis Dane Cattle Farm for the resumption of the lands by Government, and steps are being taken in other cases to improve matters. The Jahangirabad Farm which is one of the best of these grants is being steadily developed. The cream sent from this farm to the Military Dairy Farm, Lahore, amounts now to Rs. 1,800 per month. Daily milk records are now established on all these farms. Difficulties have been met with as in the Punjab calves are habitually allowed to suckle their mothers and the keeping of milk records is expensive; but con- siderable progress has been made with this work It may be mentioned that the world over, where improvement in milk-yields in a breed are aimed at, daily milk records are kept, and that for business reasons no up-to-date dairy is run without them. In the Punjab, daily milk records are kept at such dairies as Keventer's farm at Tara Devi near Simla, which is run on strictly business lines, the Imperial Cattle Farm at Karnal, the Military Dairy Farms, etc. At the Qadirabad farm milk-yields have been obtained from Hariana cows which promise well to confirm the belief in the possibilities of developing the Hariana breed into dual purpose animals. As noted in my last year's report, about 5,000 acres of land near Shergarh were given out in small grants for cattle-breeding in 1923. These grants are from one-half to two rectangles each (one rectangle=25 acres) and are granted to Syeds and Janglis. It is yet too early to say much about these small grants, but the grantees are born cattle- breeders and the cattle which they brought up for my inspection last cold weather were certainly very fine animals. Cattle-breeding is a subject of very great importance to farmers, especially in India where the farmer is depen- dent on his cattle for cultivation, as well as for other neces- sities, and with the high prices of labour and cultivated
22 fodders, it has become more necessary for farmers hero to keep only the best class of cattle if these are not to be a burden on the farm. The great differences which one sees in the types of cattle; in their inherent capacities for yielding milk, etc., make it obvious that much improve- ment could be effected in the Punjab by careful selection and breeding just as has been effected here in the case of certain crops, With this in view an outline of a com- prehensive scheme for the improvement of the breeds of cattle in the Punjab has been drawn up and is under con- sideration. The scheme also includes provision for the improvement of breeds of other domestic animals. As already stated, the department is responsible for horse-breeding in the 14 non selected districts (see page 9). At the close of the year there were 65 horse and pony stallions, and 76 donkey stallions at work in these dis- tricts, as compared with 62 horse and pony stallions and 76 donkey stallions at the end of the previous year. For further details see Table VIII, pages xvi - xvii. The Chief Superintendent remarks that the province is still short of the sanctioned scale by six horse and four donkey stallions. The latter deficiency has been made up since the report of the Chief Superintendent was written except the one donkey stallion which is replaceable out of Gurdaspur District Board funds and will be purchased next financial year subject to necessary budget provision being made by that body. The shortage of horse stallions will be made good as early as pos- sible. The total number of mares served during the year by horse stallions was 4,036 and by donkey stallions 3,396, against 3,747 and 3,240, respectively, in the previous year. Regarding sheep, 20 cross-bred marino rams and 16 cross-bred marino ewes were issued from the Govern- ment Cattle Farm, Hissar, to breeders in the province against 64 rams and 82 ewes during the previous year. In this connection kindly see further remarks on page 53. The Co-operative Department states that at the end of the year under report there were 8 cattle insurance socie- ties, 31 cattle-breeding societies, 5 cattle purchase societies and 4 sheep-breeding societies working in the province. Twenty-six cattle insurance societies were cancelled during the year. The Registrar, Co-operative Societies, considers, and I agree that the idea of cattle insurance is too advanced for the stage which the co-operative movement has yet reached in this province. Three sheep-breeding societies were cancelled
23 during the year, two of these on account of flooding of available pastures, and one because of unsatisfactory working. One cattle-breeding society was cancelled and 10 others were registered during the year These cattle breeding societies are regarded as full of possibilities for assisting in the work of cattle improvement of the province by securing continuity of effort, reporting outhreaks of disease, collect- ing inferior bulls for castration, etc., etc. Particulars re- garding Cattle Fairs and Shows will be found at Table IX on pages xviii24 also the intervals between the falls of rain were too long, and growth of grass was checked. Only 2,487 maunds one maund = 82 2/7 lb.) of hay were saved during the year against 62,392 maunds in the previous year. But although hay making was never possible as a serious enterprise, grazing was good up to the middle of the cold weather. Owing to poor supplies of water in one of the canal minors (Dabra) the Kharif harvest on the lands served by that minor were less than 50 per cent. of a normal crop. With careful management and the good grazing, however, the fodder in reserve on the farm at the end of the year under report (31st March 1925) amounted to 134,278 maunds as against 134,730 maunds on 31st March 1924, i.e., the reduction in amount of reserve fodder was negligible. This is very creditable in face of the above-mentioned facts. The table below gives the number of the more impor- tant animals sold from the farm during the year under report and in the previous year :- In the year ending 31st March 1924. 1925. (a) For breeding purposes25 District Boards in the province within the next few months. I agree with Mr. Branford's opinion that these Arab stallions produced at the farm are generally of better quality than the so-called &quot;Arab&quot; now-a-days available in the Bombay market. Although the sheep on the farm continue to flourish and to be a very profitable section of the farm activities, the demand from farmers for cross-bred merino cross country ram lambs has decreased. Mr. Branford states that the local price for country wool was Rs 45 per maund this spring; that it pays to farm sheep with wool at this price, and that the farm wool was sold at Rs. 143-8-0 per maund this year. In reply to my enquiries he also states that although the fleece from an average full grown country bred sheep varies enormously he does not think the fleece from the local desi breed is over 4 lbs., even if the sheep is unwashed before shearing, while a fleece from an average farm bred country cross merino sheep is 4 lbs. when the sheep is washed before shearing. The body weight of an average cross-bred merino on the farm is, he thinks, probably the same as that of the local desi bred, but the local breeds are small. Their first crosses are heavier, but an increase of merino blood tends to a decrease in size. Cross-breds are not as hardy as desis, however. As a factor in causing the poor demand for these cross-bred desi merinos Mr. Branford thinks, that sheep breeders in general may not have reaped advantage from these cross-breds, enough cross-bred wool never having been put on the market to permit special rates being had for it; while if the farmer uses this wool himself he finds it harder to clean and spin. It seems to me therefore that what is needed is arrangements for the collection of this cross-bred wool for sale in large enough quantity to com- mand its proper market value. The point is being brought to the notice of the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department. On account of paucity of staff the system introduced last year of keeping regular milk records of a number of cows on the farm could not be continued over complete lactation periods, but weighments of milk-yields were made once or twice a month and the result is summarised in Mr. Branford's report,26 collect much evidence to the effect that the common com- plaint that the lactation period of the Hariana cows is too short, although often true of cows purchased in the district, is not true in the case of farm bred milking cows. As already stated the maintenance of daily milk re- cords for complete lactation periods, although costly, is essential for the reasoned improvement of milk-yields, and it is already evident that much improvement can be made in the milking capacity of the Hariana cows if accu- rate data regarding milk-yields are collected. Government sanction for the construction of a shed for gentling cows and for the entertainment of staff neces- sary to carry on systematic milking, and milk recording have been applied for. Losses on the Hissar Farm from the principal con- tagious diseases were light in the year under report except for a severe outbreak of black quarter during the rains, and for equine contagious abortion which also caused heavy losses. In any attempt to reduce the losses from the latter disease a number of pony and donkey mares on the farm are now being inoculated with a vaccine prepared at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. It is hoped that this vaccine may have some protective effect. The Veterinary Assistant in charge of the hospital on the farm made a large number of inoculations against blackquarter, hæmorrhagic septicæmia, rinderpest and contagious abortion. A summary of the cases of contagious diseases which occurred on the farm is given below:27 As regards the various crops sown on the farm the yields were rather less than in the previous year, owing to shortage of irrigation water in the Dabra minor, but taking the farm as a whole the crop yields were satisfactory. Oats did unusually well, the yield of oat grain from 125 acres in one area known as the &quot;stables&quot; farm was over 24 maunds per acre, and the total yield of oats from 604 matured acres is expected to be over 10,500 maunds, i.e., nearly 16 maunds per acre. This the Superintendent points out is more than double the average yield ten years ago, and considering that this average include yields from farms situated at 6 to 11 miles from Hissar, difficult to supervise and to manure, these outturns are very satisfactory. A point of great interest to oat farmers is that after carrying out the &quot;formalin&quot; treatment on oat seeds before sowing, the whole oat crop on the Hissar Farm was completely free from &quot;Smut&quot; except one small field, the seeds for which are believed to have missed treatment. This disease did severe damage to the oat crop on the farm a number of years ago, and does immense damage to the oat crops in the province annually. Oats are a most excellent fodder and the elimination of smut disease would raise the profits from oat farming very greatly. Several bighas of land have been planted out with &quot;Kikuyu&quot; grass in order to gain experience of its grazing capacity. In trials made with lucerne (Medicago Sativa) and Berseem or Egyptian Clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) as regards their powers of producing quantities of green fodder, lucerne seems to be much the more promising. Among the improved facilities for the working of the farm which have been added during the year, the Superin- tendent mentions the addition of the blower machine which receives bhusa from the combined threshing and bhusa making machine and blows it straight under cover, or into a stack up to a height of 30 feet, thus saving much manual labour. In one day in the season under report it delivered 720 maunds of bhusa. The Superintendent also mentions a combined &quot;crush and foot bath&quot; which has been erected at the hospital, which enormously facilitates the dressing of wounds and other operations on animals, the majority of which are wild and unbroken. Mr. Branford has submitted a paper on &quot;The ageing of Indian Breeds of Cattle&quot; which has been accepted by the Agricultural Journal of D
28 India. This paper is a useful contribution to agricultural knowledge. An interesting innovation of the year is the starting of night schools on the farm for its illiterate employees The literate members of the staff very kindly gave their services free for teaching work. The school was started at the instance of Mr. Atma Ram, Inspector of Schools, Ambala Division, with the energetic co-operation of the Deputy Superintendent of the Farm, M. Ghulam Hussain. It has proved popular and I feel much indebted to these men for opening the school and for keeping it going. The farm accounts have just been audited by the Examiner of the Local Fund Accounts. The total value of the live stock at the end of the year under report was Rs. 6,77,327 as against Rs. 6,68,063 at the end of the pre- vious year. The profit and loss accounts for the year under teport show a net deficit of Rs. 20,491. But under the exist- ing system of accounts no credit is given to the farm for the free issue of horse and donkey stallions to the District Boards, nor for the concession rates at which bulls are supplied to District Boards. The pro-forma account of the farm, as verified by the auditors, show that the free issue of horse and donkey stallions and the concessions for bulls amounted to Rs. 93,338 during the year, and when these are taken into account the farm shows a profit on the year's working of Rs. 72,847. This profit coupled with the great usefulness of the farm to the province in improv- ing the breeds of farm animals is a great achievement. An abstract showing main results of the working of the farm is shown at Table XIV, pages xxvii29 Annual Report of the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore, for the year 1924-25. Gazetted-staff. COLONEL G. K. WALKER resumed his duties as Princi- pal and Professor of Medicine at the commencement of the session on return from leave for two months and 26 days prefixed to the College vacation. During his absence Mr. Taylor officiated as Principal. The appointment of Professor of Hygiene, which had been vacant since the 19th November 1923, has been filled provisionally by Mr. A. C. Aggarwala, M.R.C.VS., who was appointed on the 19th January 1925. Mr. W. Taylor, Captain Walker, Khan Sahib M. Ghulam Rasul Khan and Sardar Hardit Singh held their respective appointments throughout the year. Mr. Karam Elahi was confirmed in the appointment of Professor of Parasitology with effect from the 1st January 1925 after completing his probationary period. Sardar Mool Singh and Mr. Haq Nawaz Khan are still on probation in their respective appointments. Non-gazetted staff. 2. There were no changes during the year in the establishment of the non-gazetted staff. Vernacular course. 3. The seven remaining students of the vernacular class, who had failed in March 1924, were re-examined in June and on pass- ing were awarded diplomas. Admission. 4. One hundred and twenty-five candidates submitted applications for admission to the College in May. They did not all present themselves for selection but a large proportion did and of these thirty-seven were selected. Three of them had the F. Sc. (Medical group) qualification and the remainder were matriculate, Included were six nominated students, viz., three from Mysore, two from Kapurthala and one from Dharangadra (Kathiawar States. D2
30 5. At the close of the year under report the number of students was:31 from private pockets. It should be recognised however that if efficiency is desired the outlay in time and money must be considerable. Examinations. 6. The annual examinations were held in June and the supplementary examinations for students failing in one subject in Dec- ember with the following results:32 It may be said that the place is generally popular with owners of dogs and that a very steady income to Government is derived from it. The ward is also of considerable educa- tional value to the students. Special work. 9. The post of Professor of Hygiene was not filled until the 19th January and Mr. Aggarwala's time was fully occupied in trying to make up deficiencies in the subjects for which the chair he holds is responsible. It was particularly hard on the students of the final year that so much delay had occurred in filling the vacancy as they were compelled to take an extra subject in that year's course. Certain experimental work has been carried out in various direc- tions with no very positive results at present though that does not detract from the value of the work. A consider- able number of examinations of morbid material have been conducted. During the year 170 post-mortems were made and 160 pathological specimens examined. The demand for vaccines and sera of different kinds has increased and caused extra work to the staff employed in the duty of preparation. Certain sera are now supplied to the Mayo Hospital and private medical practitioners. If the demand increases, as appears probable, additional laboratory staff will be called for and the installation of a refrigerating plant will be necessary. As stated in previous reports the Punjab Veterinary College is primarily a teaching institution and not a re- search institution. Original and experimental investiga- tions have been conducted in the past and continue to be conducted as opportunity permits. The results so far achieved have not been without value. The members of the teaching staff are keen on progres- sive study but if concentrated effort on experimental re- search is contemplated a special staff must be employed. In other departments separate research and teaching insti- tutions are maintained and the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment has a separate Central Research Institute at Muktesar established and staffed for the purpose. Buildings and equipment. 10. It is understood that the much needed improve- ments to the Physical and Chemical Laboratories will be taken in hand shortly. During the year a sewerage system, which was
33 greatly needed, has been introduced in the back premises of the College. An extension of this system to the remaining buildings would be beneficial. Certain minor improvements have been made in addition. It is hoped that funds for the improvement of the Hostel will soon be forthcoming. The present accommodation is inadequate and the compound is an eye-sore, more particularly the main road frontage, which requires to be properly enclosed. The equipment of the College has been maintained and added to as funds permitted. It may be regarded as very good, though certain additions have yet to be made. One need is an X-ray Installation, which would prove a valuable asset to diagnosis. An estimate of cost is being obtained. Income. 11. The income for the year amounted to Rs. 19,937 against Rs. 16,518 in the previous year, being an increase of Rs. 3,319. The increase is due to more hospital revenue and more admission fees. The Hospital income was Rs. 1,503 better than in the previous year and is partly the result of increas- ing the charges at the behest of Government. This policy may account for the decrease in the attendance in certain departments. Expenditure. 12. The expenditure was Rs. 1,65,569 against Rs. 1,60,352 in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to increments in salaries. Employment of alamni. 13. The number of alumni of the College who are out of employment is a serious problem and in many cases the position is distressing. The necessity of limiting the number of admissions has been already referred to and it will be more apparent on an examination of the actual figures now presented. The Army authorities have not only ceased to recruit but they have placed their veterinary establishments under reduction. This remark applies particularly to the Army Remount Department. The register of candidates for employment maintained in the Principal's office, which has recently been verified, records the names of 81 men seeking employment. Of these, 39 are men trained on behalf of the Military Departments and 42 civilians. The former
34 number is made up of those men discharged on reduction of establishments and only seven of them appear to be pensioners. It is ascertained from the register that some 35 men have never received or been able to obtain any kind of employmen since they qualified. Of the total number out of employment, 67 are Punjabis. It must be remembered that there is very little scope for private practice particularly in the Punjab and the men have always looked forward to state or local govern- ment employment. It cannot be denied that the situa- tion merits very serious attention with a view to providing employment for these men, most of whom are in severe straits and deserving of sympathy. The departments in the United Provinces, Central Pro- vinces and North-West Frontier Provinces hitherto served by the Punjab Veterinary College are requiring no recruits and it is understood that in some cases their establishments have been reduced. It was not anticipated that recruitment to services so essential to agricultural interests would be brought under reduction. It is hoped that expansion will be seriously con- sidered in the immediate future. The facilities exist for educating a large number of efficient veterinarians at the Punjab Veterinary College. If from motives of economy it is considered desirable to train an inferior class to work under the supervision of those more highly trained, that can be brought about, but with so many men out of employment the time for the consideration of such a scheme has not arrived. At the same time it would be little short of immoral to cease training efficient Indian veterinarians for State service as the necessity for their services must arise as enlightenment develops. General remarks. 14. The adoption of the new course in English at the Punjab Veterinary College four years ago has led to considerable criticism, mostly ill-informed, and it appears desirable to clarify the situation. The institution of the new educa- tional system was more than a step in advance. It was a
35 revolution. The course of study that has been introduced is based on that adopted in the colleges of Great Britain and in some directions it is more comprehensive. It is intended to produce professional men possessing a sound knowledge of veterinary science in all its branches erected on a foundation of scientific and logical reasoning. The practical work in every branch is a special feature at the College. The qualification obtained is intended to be a mark of capacity to apply the education derived to the elucidation of problems which cannot be dealt with by methods of routine. The men who were trained previously were required and maintained as assistants to a highly trained staff of officers recruited in Great Britain. It has been accepted that there will practically be no more re- cruitment of British veterinarians for civil employment under Government. Consequently, if veterinary science is to be a factor in the economic development of India, and no intelligentsia can repudiate its value, it is obviously necessary to educate Indians accordingly. The present Prin- cipal of the Punjab Veterinary College undertakes the entire and full responsibility for the initiation of the higher course of study now adopted and only regrets that it cannot at présent be made longer still. The Army authorities were in absolute agreement with the scheme when it was in- stituted, though they have been unable to support it mat- terially. It has to be admitted that the scheme appears to be expensive, but that is mainly due to the lack of support the College has received. Scientific education cannot be obtain- ed without considerable outlay in money. The fact remains that &quot;if the tune is required the piper must be paid&quot; and, as India is desirous of establishing a veterinary department entirely manned by Indians, money must be spent in educat- ing them up to the requisite standard. The author of the scheme will soon be completing his service in India, but he has seen the full course through and is content to be judged on the results when the fruit is ripe. Since the Government agreed to raise the scale of pay for Veterinary Assistant Surgeons there has been competi- tion for admission to the College. This has enabled the Principal to select students to a certain extent. The course is too difficult for men of inferior mental calibre. The teaching staff has been reorganised and trained- Three Indians were selected and sent to Great Britain for
36 special training as Professors in their respective subjects. The accommodation and equipment of the College and Hospital are claimed to be as good or better than any other institution of the kind in existence, but, as indicated above, certain improvements and additions are still required to per- fect it and to maintain its predominant position. During the year the health and behaviour of the students residing in the College Hostel have been good. They have taken a keen interest in games and the annual sports were well supported. The Principal desires to place on record his appreciation of the way the members of the staff, teaching, hospital and clerical, have supported him, not only during the past year, but through a period which has been redolent of changes and new endeavours involving extra and, at times, exacting duties.

37 Report on the Civil Veterinary Department, Punajb, for the year 1924-25. Administration. 1. The following statement shows the names of officers who held charge of the several appointments and the amount of touring done by them during the year under report:38 2. As usual the Chief Superintendent, Superintend- ents and the Deputy Superintendents toured in their res- pective circles in connection with horse, mule and cattle breeding, the investigation and control of animal diseases and for the inspection of Veterinary Hospitals, etc. 3. Every effort is made to keep the staff up to date in their professional work by closely questioning them on their methods of treatment as noted in the hospital records. The effect of this system is very noticeable in the increased use being made by the staff of the professional books of references supplied to our hospitals. District Officers and all representative zamindars were interviewed as far as possible in regard to the Veterinary requirements of their districts. 4. During the period Mr. Branford acted as Chief Superintendent, all the grantee farms situated in the Lower Bari Doab Canal Colony were inspected by him. He also visited the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Mukresar, in connection with the disease &quot;contagious equine abortion&quot; and acted as an Examiner at the Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore. He also attended the Depart- mental Conference held in Lahore in April 1924 presided over by the Honourable Minister for Agriculture. 5. Mr. Quirke, since his return from leave, visited the following districts outside the Central Punjab Circle:39 Treatment of Disease. I.40 The incidence of this disease in the Province is much more serious than these figures indicate, as it is well known to be more prevalent in those districts where horse-breeding operations and equine diseases are controlled by the Army Remount Department. Centres for the treatment of this disease in horses by the Sohawa Laboratory staff, have been established at the Sheikhupura, Muridki and Bhera Veterinary Hospitals. The disease runs such an acute course in horses that very great difficulty is being felt in securing early cases for treatment from the villages. Methods of treatment are being adopted in collaboration with the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, the results of which are noted in the Annual Report of the Sohawa Laboratory. Dourine.41 It is satisfactory to be able to record the partial removal of the restrictions on touring, which made it possible for our staff to deal with a large number of outbreaks and to carry out inoculations of in-contact animals on such an extensive scale. The increased dosage of serum now being adopted is helping to popularise the practice of mixing inoculated with the diseased animals in affected villages as a means of actively immunising against this disease. The time, however, is approaching when economic con- ditions will be the determining factor in helping to intro- duce the serum simultaneous method of inoculation as the more effective method of dealing with Rinderpest in this country. Steps are now shortly being taken to carry out this system of inoculation on the cattle-breeding farms, so that the young male and female stock actively immunised against this disease may be issued to the districts having an enhanced value to breeders. Foot and Mouth Disease.42 Inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. 43 Other contagious diseases44 These figures show a very decided increase in the activi- ties of the Department since restrictions have been par- tially removed on the touring work of the staff. The very large increase in the number of castrations is particularly satisfactory. The volume of work achieved serves to indicate the importance which the Department attaches to a rigorous castration campaign in dealing with the cattle-breeding situation in the Province. III.45 26. New veterinary hospitals are proposed for the following places:46 Buildings of Veterinary Hospitals. 28. Standard plans of hospitals have been prepared to meet local requirements. In accord- ance with the present policy of this Department, requests for the opening of new hospitals must be supported by offers of help from local subscribers. Simla Veterinary Hos- pital. 29. The receipts and expenditure of the Simla Veteri- nary Hospital during the year under report were Rs. 10,329 and Rs. 6,650, respectively, against Rs. 11,138 and Rs. 7,880, respectively, during the previous year. The surplus of income over the expenditure, which has been credited into the Government Treasury by the Munici- pality, was Rs. 3,679 against Rs. 3,258 or Rs. 421 more than last year. The minimum amount that is required to be paid to Government annually (according to the terms of transfer of the institution) on account of pay and allowances of the Veterinary Assistant and interest on the initial cost (capital outlay) of the hospital plus that on the additional expen- diture on buildings at 4½ per cent. is Rs. 3,459 per annum. The net profit to Government was therefore Rs. 220 against a loss of Rs. 201 last year. The suggestion of raising hospital fees in order to cover the increased cost of maintenance and make it at least self- supporting has not been accepted by the Simla Municipal Committee. Certain economies in the expenditure of this hospital were recommended by the Chief Superintendent and sanc- tioned by the Punjab Government. Their introduction has caused a satisfactory reduction in the hospital charges, which is evident from the figures quoted above. Breeding Operations. I.47 the year under report, which were complied with in full by that institution. Details of the bulls shown in column 3 of table VII are as follows :48 share of the available funds towards the work of this Department. The successful outcome of cattle-breeding work in the Province depends to a large extent on a steady supply of funds being available, to make it possible to secure contin- uity in the supply of good bulls over a period of years, even to the extent of a limited number of villages in any particular district. It will be noted that there were 247 casualties out of a total strength of 1,774 bulls at the beginning of the year49 that, owing to the precarious state of the cattle-breeding industry there as the result of bad years, the small cattle breeder is not sufficiently sound financially to be able to lock up any of his savings in fodder reserves50 Dhanni cattle-breeding scheme. 32. The work now embraces part of the four North Punjab districts, Attock, Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Mianwali. The fodder situation generally throughout the Dhanni tract has favoured the continued progress of the work done under the Dhanni Cattle scheme during the year. The total number of bulls enrolled at the end of the year was 108, an increase of 17 bulls since last year, of which 14 have been entered on the subsidy system. Twelve thousand two hundred and nineteen cows were covered during the year by approved bulls, an increase of 5,062 as compared with the previous year. Covering results for the year ending April 1924 have averaged about 64 per cent. which represents a very satis- factory increase in the number of well-bred young stock born in the tract for that year. More supervising staff is necessary to deal with the very marked expansion in the work of the scheme. I am glad to note that Government is contemplating more liberal annual grants towards the scheme which has hitherto given such very encouraging results. It is hoped that the importance of increased supervision will not be overlooked. With a view to enlisting public interest in the work of the scheme a Dhanni Cattle Breeding Association has been started in Rawalpindi, Attock and Jhelum Districts, all of which have held regular meetings during the year and collected certain funds which they intend to apply in the revival of the Dhanni breed. The Rawalpindi Association has applied for registration to the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, it is hoped that the others will do so in the near future. Cattle-breeding grauts. 33. The experience gained in the working of these grants has very clearly demonstrated the almost irresistible craving for making money quickly at the expense of their cattle by certain of the grantees. The commercial dis- abilities from which the cattle breeding industry in this country suffers, are put forward as reasons for neglecting to shoulder their responsibilities, which they undertook when selected by Government for cattle breeding grants.
51 There is little doubt that the management of a breeding farm on modern lines exacts very close supervision over the many details connected with animal management, of which the grantees have had little previous experience. For some time our efforts have been directed to- wards inducing the grantees to employ responsible staff on their farms as a means of overcoming this difficulty. As anticipated the Montgomery cattle grants have made more progress than the Hissar cattle grants. The Jahangirabad farm especially is being steadily developed, the cream sent daily to the Military Dairy Farm, Lahore Cantonment, amounting to about Rs. 1,800 monthly which helps towards the internal economy of the Farm. Milk records are being kept on all farms including the Hissar cattle grants where the initial difficulties are being gradually surmounted. At the Qadirabad Farm very promising milk yields have been obtained from Hissar cows. This experience tends to confirm our belief that a breed, which under natural conditions on the ordinary grazing areas can rear such sturdy young stock, in times of famine can so successfully fend for itself where other breeds fail, there can be little doubt of the possibilities of developing it into the dual-purpose breed of the future. A serious effort in this direction will need the expenditure of money over a long period of years in the necessary organisation required on the Hissar Farm, from where the major supply of stud bulls is now made to the dis- tricts. The scheme of small cattle grants for Montgomery cows started near Shergarh in the Montgo ery District is making quite marked progress under the influence of Pir Muhammad Hussain Shah, M. L. C. Montgomery bulls from the small selected herd at Hissar have been supplied, of which some very promising youngsters were seen on my last inspection. A high standard of cows is being insisted on, whilst arrangements are in progress with the Co-operative Department for the starting of milk re- cording societies amongst the grantees. Buffalo breeding. 34. Every effort is being made to encourage the keeping of well-bred male buffaloes
52 for stud purposes. As a general rule owners show more care in the selection of the bull buffalo for the mating of their buffalo cows than they do in the case of cattle. The castration of inferior bulls, towards which the Department is paying special attention, is helping very considerably to reduce the number of ill-bred stock in the districts. Considering the anxiety expressed in various quarters regarding the improvement in the supply of milk and ghee in urban areas, there has been a very poor response by municipalities to the appeal made by this Department, to provide proper facilities for the thousands of excellent milch cows and buffaloes which are now being covered by scrub bulls. II.53 III.54 the Co-operative Department :55 The idea of cattle insurance as noted by the Registrar, Co-operative Societies, in his last Annual Report is too ad- vanced for the stage which the Co-operative movement has at present reached. On the other hand the Department regards the increase of cattle breeding societies as full of possibilities for the solution of our difficulties in the work of cattle improve- ment. They provide the necessary organisation through which we can hope to secure continuity of effort in improv- ing the indigenous breeds of the Province. We welcome the time when cattle breeding societies will be more general throughout the district, when the onus of reporting an outbreak of disease from the village will be borne by the society, when the inferior bulls of the village are collected for castration and the societies are helping our staff in carrying out effective measures for dealing with dis- ease. Establishment. Numerical strength, 56 Expenditure. Expenditure,57 Necessary proposals in this connection are being pre- pared and will be submitted shortly. The subordinate staff both clerical and veterinary have with very few exceptions worked conscientiously during the year. I have especially to record my satisfaction of the field work done by the following inspecting staff :58 Annual Report of the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, for the year 1924-25 THE Farm was in the charge of Mr. T. J. Egan from April 1st to November 28th. Mr. Egan officiating as Super- intendent in addition to his own duties. The Farm was in my charge from November 28th to the end of the year. Mr. Egan reverting to his post of Assistant Superintendent, which he held till March 24th when he was transferred to Rawalpindi as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab and North- West Frontier Province. 2. Total rainfall during the year was 11.65". That is about 2 inches less than average. In addition to being below normal, intervals between falls were too long, and the growth of grass was checked by long intervals of drought. Grazing was good up to the middle of the cold weather, but it was never possible to start hay making as a serious enterprise. Only 2,487 maunds (maund =82lbs.) were saved as against 62,392 maunds in the previous year. 3. Canal supplies were good, except on the Dabra Minor on which branch the Farm supply seems to have been permanently reduced. The Kharif harvest on the Farm served by the Dabra Minor was a failure, being less than 50 per cent. of a normal crop. Fodder in reserve at the end of the year amounted to 1,34,278 maunds as against 1,34,730 maunds on 31st March 1924. So inspite of the rains being on the whole unfavourable only a very small in road was made into our fodder re- serve. 4. Table XII shows the changes in Farm Live Stock during the year.
59 The following animals were sold :60 (a) As regards cattle, the number of bulls issued to Punjab District Boards constitutes a record for the Farm. Demand for Farm cattle stock continues keen from other sources. As may be noticed from the above list the Govern- ment of United Provinces has again been a considerable purchaser. Mr. Parr, Deputy Director of Agriculture, In charge, Cattle Breeding, United Provinces, paid two visits during the year, to purchase cattle and I gathered from him that our cattle are much liked in many parts of the United Pro- vinces. Mr. Parr's second visit took place at the end of March and on that occasion he purchased 69 head of cattle, 34 heifers and 35 young stock bulls. Milking qualities.61 Cow No. 44-1/1, born in 1921 ; first calf on 22nd July 1924. In 106 days, from 25th August 1924 to 8th January 1925, from two teats only she gave 1,314 lbs. Checked in February 1925, she was giving 17 lbs. daily from four teats. Checked in April 1925, she was giving 15 lbs. daily from four teats. She was still in milk on 1st June 1925. Cow No. 212-2/7, born in 1917, second calf on 31st August 1924. In 80 days (from 20th September 1924 to 8th Decem- ber 1924) she gave from two teats only 903 lbs. Checked in February 1925, she was giving 16 lbs. daily from four teats. Checked in April 1925, she was giving 10 lbs. daily from four teats. She was still in milk on 1st June 1925. A common complaint against the Hariana cow - is that her lactation period is too short, and so far as my experience goes this is often true of cows purchased in the district; but if staff to keep milk records on this Farm is ever sanctioned I shall be able to produce much evidence to the effect that that is not the case with the Farm-bred milking cows. In addition to the four cows noted above, I have recent- ly checked the yields of three more, late in their lactation periods :62 In fact a big percentage of the cows bred on this Farm which are taken up for milking, have long lactation periods. Photographs of the above and other cows in the Farm milk lines are shown at the end of this report. (b) Donkeys.63 5. Contagious Disease.64 6. Cultivation.65 Yields were rather less than in the previous year but were on the whole satisfactory. The decrease being account- ed for by decreased supply of water in the Dabra Minor. Oats sown in the autumn of 1924, did unusually well, but a large proportion of the crop was laid by high winds in the spring, and was difficult to harvest, and I expected the yields to be affected. Later I was reminded of the old saying in England to the effect, that laid crops have never ruined the Farmer, as the yields were actually the best ever recorded on the Farm. From one Farm (Stable) the yield from 125 acres was over 24 maunds per acre. The total yield from 604 matured acres will be over 10,500 maunds (maund = 82 lbs.). As this includes yields from Farms situated six and ten miles from Hissar, difficult to supervise, and difficult to manure, I consider the result satisfactory. It is much more than double the average yields per acre ten years ago 7. Experimental Work.66 (d) Berseem (Egyptian Clover).67 10. The whole staff both outdoor and clerical worked to my satisfaction, if any is to be singled out for special commendation it should be the second Farm Overseer, M. Atta Muhammad. Clerical work on the Farm, both inside the office and outside in the workshops, etc., has much increased in recent years and can no longer be satisfactorily coped with by the existing staff. It is to be hoped that Government will rapidly sanction additional clerks, recently applied for. 11.
