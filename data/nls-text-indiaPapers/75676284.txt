Poona, dated 24th June 1914. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1913-1914. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. K. WALKER, Major, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. THROUGH THE DIRECTOR or AGRICULTURE, BOMBAY, POONA N 519 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT IN THE BOMBAY PRESIDENCY PROPER FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1913-1914. General administration. Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Maxwell held charge throughout the year. He was away from head-quarters for 150 days, and tra- velled 12,240 miles by rail, and 449 miles by road. He inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Nandurbár. Jalgaon, Amalner, Násik, Ahmednagar. Shrigonda, Sangamner, Poona, Bárámati, Manchar, Sholápur, Bársi, Pandharpur, Sátára, Karád, Islámpnr, Belgaum, Dhárwár, Hubli, Gadag, Byádgi, Kalyán, Pálghar, Surat, Bulsár, Bárdoli, Broach, Ankleshvar, Nadiád, Ahmedabad, Viramgám, Dholka and Bhamburda (Poona). He also inspected the stallion stands at Yeola, Ahmednagar, Shrigonda, Ráhuri, Bárámati, Sirur, Bársi, Karmá1a, Sángola, Ahmedabad, Dholka and Nadiád. He attended the Agricultural Conference held at Coimbatore. He visited the Vaccine Depôt at Belgaum. He acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in November and December 1913. He visited Bombay on several occasions to purchase stallions. He inspected the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi 5 times. 2. Mr. J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. He travelled 4,404 miles by rail, 246 by road, and 80 by sea. He inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Dhulia, Jalgaon, Sávda, Násik, Vaduj, Chikodi, Bail-Hongal, Bijápur, Bágalkot, A'nand, Godhra and Bhamburda (Poona). He also visited Ahmedabad and Belgaum and attended the Cattle Show at Ránebennur. He inspected the stallion stands at Dhulia and Godhra. He visited the Government Civil and Military Dairies at Poona. The object of the appointment of a Deputy Superintendent at head-quarters was to free the Superintendent from routine work and that object has been attained to a considerable extent. Colonel Maxwell was away a good deal during the year and consequently Mr. Buxy's tours were somewhat restricted. 3. Mr. E. S. Farbrother, M.R.C.V.S., Civil Veterinary Department, was attached for training from October 1913 to March 1914 when he was transferred to Sind. He visited the following places:20 Four thousand and seventy-four deaths from epidemic disease were reported against 4,050 in the previous year. Equine opidemic disease.21 72 cases of rabies in dogs were reported by Veterinary Assistants. Number of cases treated for contagious disease. ~ Table IV. 9. 1,073 outbreaks of disease were attended by Veterinary Assistants and 39 by Veterinary Inspectors and all possible treatment and assistance afforded. 24,478 cases of contagious disease were treated on tour, being an increase of 16,787 cases over last year. As the staff is increased epidemic disease will be brought under more effective control. An adequate reserve is essential to deal with important outbreaks. This question is being considered. 10. During the year the subordinate staff submitted 262 specimens to the Bombay Veterinary College Laboratory for diagnosis and 40 morbid specimens were sent to the College Museum.

39 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE. Below letter No. 3127 of 24th June 1914 from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona, to the Under Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay. No. A41 No. G-.378 OF 1914. GENERAL DEPARTMENT : Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 21/24st July 1914. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the annual report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Raj- putana, on the work of the veterinary department in Sind during the year 1913-14. 2. The Department remained in charge of the Superintendent, Mr. J. G- Cattell, throughout the year, assisted by Khan Sahib S. G. Haji, Deputy Super- intendent. Both these officers did a considerable amount of touring by rail; but it is essential that both the Superintendent and his Deputy should tour more systematically by road in the districts of Sind, in order to get into closer touch with stock-breeders and agriculturists. Instructions have been issued by the Commissioner towards this end and steps will be taken to ensure that these instructions receive proper attention in future. Although it is difficult for Vete- rinary Assistants to leave their dispensaries for any length of time, the Com- missioner would be glad to see efforts on their part to do some touring as apart from visits to villages for attendance on cases. The popularity and progress of the Department depend largely on the confidence with which the Veterinary Assistants can inspire zamindars, and this can best be done by visits to the villages of the latter marked by successful operations and inoculations there. 3. In order to overcome the difficulty of obtaining suitable candidates from Sind for the Bombay Veterinary College, the Commissioner has found it necessary to reduce the educational standard hitherto required of candidates and to admit men otherwise suitable, provided they possessed a sufficient knowledge of English to follow the course of studies. It has at the same time been neces- sary to raise the amount of the scholarships for Sindhi scholars to Rs. 35 per mensem, the maximum admissible under the rules. While the sons of land- holders are still preferred, other candidates are chosen, should the first be lacking. Educated Mussalmans have now so many lucrative appointments open to them in the province that they have hesitated to enter a small department where the chances of promotion are not very great. But to attract Mussalmans it has been necessary to take the two steps mentioned above. 4. The year has on the whole been a favourable one. Deaths from rinder- pest, surra, anthrax and hæmorrhagic septicæmia all decreased. The large number of inoculations against hemorrhagic septicemia in the Nawabshah district is gratifying. The three cases of bubonic plague among the monkeys of the Karachi Zoological Gardens were only remarkable for the local excitement caused by the closing of the garden to the public. The attention of the Col- lector of Karachi and the President of the Karachi Municipality will be drawn, to the remarks of the Superintendent on the increase of rabies in Karachi. A case of South African horse sickness was detected by the Deputy Superintendent from amongst the chargers of the officers of the 18th Infantry which arrived at Karachi by the R. I. M. S. "Hardinge'' on 14th October 1913, and is import- ant as being the first of its kind detected in India. In view of the highly contagious nature of the disease, the horse was kept under observation for 18 days and was finally destroyed under the advice of the Imperial Bacteriologist in India. The contacts were segregated and were finally discharged after being found free from all symptoms of the disease. In the absence of a lazaretto, which is one of the great needs of Karachi from a veterinary point of view, it was necessary to utilize an open space on the outskirts of the town as a tempo- rary hospital. N 542 5. The increase in the number of Veterinary Assistants and dispensaries, together with the growing attendance at the latter, shows clearly that there is a demand for veterinary treatment throughout the province. The zamindars of the Shahbandar division themselves subscribed Rs. 17,000 for a dispensary at Sujawal, which was opened this year. But this demand it has not been possible to meet hitherto owing to the difficulty of obtaining men for the Department on the low initial pay offered. Government, however, have been pleased to raise the pay of the two lowest grades of the Veterinary Assistants in Sind from Rs. 30 and Rs. 45 to Rs. 40 and Rs. 50, respectively, and in accordance with their instructions contained in Government Resolution No. 4bll, dated the 22nd December 1913, the Commissioner is submitting further proposals to render the department more attractive. 6. Amongst other matters dealt with during the year were the compila- tion of a complete set of rules and departmental instructions and the issue of orders to secure the prompt intimation by the revenue department to Veteri- nary Assistants and superior veterinary officers of the outbreaks of cattle disease. 7. Bearing in mind the difficulty hitherto experienced of securing trained local veterinary graduates to take charge of the dispensaries as they are opened, the work of the department has progressed successfully during the year and with the opening of new dispensaries in charge of trained assistants, more rapid development may be looked for in future.

No. 9419. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 5th October 1914. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 87-L., dated 30th April 19142 no fewer than 3,955 villages as compared with 2,760 in the preceding year. They treated 24,478 cases of contagious and 14,312 cases of non-contagious disease, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 7,691 and 13,140. The Governor in Council views with the greatest satisfaction the efforts made by the officers of the Department to popularize their profession in the villages surrounding their head-quarters, and is pleased highly to commend the energetic touring of which the figures quoted above are ample proof. Even better results may be expected as the Department expands; and as one Inspector and forty-three Veterinary Assistants are to be added to the establishment during the course of the next five years, each succeeding year should witness an expansion of the beneficent activities of the Department. In view of the rise of pay granted to the lower grades of the cadre, it is to be hoped that no difficulty will be experienced in carrying out the sanctioned increase of staff. The development and the present satisfactory state of the Department is largely due to the efforts of Lieut.-Colonel H. M. Maxwell, who has recently retired after three years' careful superintendence, and the Governor in Council is pleased to acknowledge the high value of his services throughout that period. 3. In Sind the year was favourable, and there was a large decrease in the number of deaths caused by contagious diseases. The number of dispensaries rose from 8 to 11 and the number of cases treated, both on tour and otherwise, showed a satisfactory advance. Government endorse the opinion formulated by the Commissioner in Sind as to the importance of touring by road, for it is only by this expedient that the Department can win the confidence of cultivators in outlying parts. The large number of inoculations against hæmorrhagic septi- cæmia and the success attending the measure, provide an interesting and welcome feature of the year's working. 4. The administration of the Glanders and Farcy Department continued to be satisfactory. C. W. A. TURNER, Under Secretary to Government.

From G, F. KEATINGE, ESQUIRE, CLE., I.C.S., Director of Agriculture; To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 6th July 1915. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report of the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, for the year 1914-15. 2. It is satisfactory to note that the number of students and the proportion of students from this Presidency are tending to rise. 3. The number of students passing out of the College this year is small but may be expected to rise in the near future. The Civil Veterinary Department of this Presidency is in need of recruits and it is likely that for some years it will need them in larger numbers than are available. 4. The report indicates a good year's work, including the additional duties undertaken by the staff which can barely be considered sufficient for its ordinary work. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.
13 No. 71-L. OF 1915. Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, 5th June 1915. From K. HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1914-15. 2. During the year under report 40 horses were seized under the Act and taken to the Lazaretto as against 48 last year. Of these, 35 were found to be diseased within the meaning of the Act and dealt with accordingly. Of the 35 diseased animals, 5 were cases of Glanders, 1 Epizootic Lymphangitis and 29 Surra. Besides the above cases 55 equines (38 horses and 17 mules) belonging to different regiments passing through Bombay at the time of embarking were removed to the Lazaretto as cases of Glanders and Surra and were dealt with under the Act. Of the 55 cases, 38 horses proved to be affected with Glanders and 17 mules to be affected with Surra. These 55 animals come from the follow- ing units :14 The following table shows the numbers and class of horses imported during the year as compared with former years :15 APPENDIX I.

17 No. 4288 OF 1915. From MAJOR G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., F.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, dated 26th June 1915. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1914-15. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. K. WALKER, Major, Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency. (Through the Director of Agriculture.) N 1519 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1914-15. Major G. K. Walker took over from Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Maxwell on the 12th April and held charge for the remainder of year. He was on tour for 170 days and travelled 12,282 miles by rail, 1,036 miles by road and 40 miles by sea. He visited 16 districts of the Presidency proper and the Káthiá- wár and Pálanpur Agencies for investigation and inspection. He interviewed district officers and others in regard to the work of the department as far as possible. He attended several outbreaks of epidemic disease and instituted or criticised repressive measures. He inspected 35 veterinary dispensaries and 11 stallion stands once or more. He visited the Vaccine Depôt at Belgaum, the military dairies at Belgaum and Kirkee, and the civil dairy at Poona. He inspected a number of pinjrapoles in the course of his tours and the cattle famine camp at Sholápur. He attended the cattle shows at Talod and Bijápur and the horse show at Ahmedabad. He acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April and November 1914. He spent 23 days at the Northcote Cattle Farm, Chhárodi. 2. Mr. J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. He was 63 days on tour and travelled 3,108 miles by rail, 598 miles by road, and 328 miles by sea. He visited 11 districts and inspected 19 dispensaries and 5 stallion stands. He attended several outbreaks of epidemic disease and organised inoculation work. He acted as Personal Assistant to the Superintendent at head-quarters. 3. The number of Veterinary Inspectors was increased to four on the 1st July. A new division with head-quarters at Násik was created and the districtd redistributed. The Inspectors were each provided with a clerk. The work has much increased of late and the increased establishment has been beneficial. I.20 8. Epizootics among cattle and more especially rinderpest and foot and mouth disease may be frequently traced to infection from adjoining Native States where there is little or no veterinary staff available. At present restric- tion on movements of cattle appears to be impracticable. The department is frequently applied to for assistance by Native States but it can be given rarely as men cannot be spared. Government have sanctioned the deputation of men when they can be spared under certain conditions which have been communi- cated. Equine contagious disease. 9. There was an increase in the number of deaths from glanders and surra in horses in Bombay City in the year under report. No cases from glanders were detected in the districts of the Presidency and the deaths from surra showed a slight decrease. No cases of dourine or anthrax were reported among equines. One case of epizootic lymphangitis was reported from Bom- bay City. An outbreak of strangles appeared among the animals employed on the Talod-Modása dák line in the Ahmedabad district, but the number of deaths was not reported. The rules for dealing with disease scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act are being revised. Bovine contagious disease. 10. Rinderpest.21 See Table III. 17. Preventive inoculation against rinderpest was conducted in 302 outbreaks. 54,223 animals were inoculated, of which 262 died after inoculation. 4,046 uninoculated con- tact animals died of the disease. This is the largest number of inoculations carried out in this Presidency so far and it may be regarded as significant of the progress and popularity of the department's endeavours. Results appear to have been good on the whole. It is not easy to obtain absolutely accurate and unprejudiced information in all places but improvement in this respect may be expected. 88 inoculations in an outbreak of hæmorrhagic septicæmia at the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chhárodi were performed and no deaths followed. Instructions have been issued to the veterinary staff in regard to the use of more laboratory products in the field and vaccination against blackquarter and hæmorrhagic septicæmia will be carried out when the local conditions appear to be suitable. Other disease. See Table IV. 18. 3,779 villages were visited by the Veterinary Assistants during the year and apart from their work in connection with the treatment and inoculation of animals suffering from contagious disease they treated 14,271 animals for non-contagious ailments and castrated 67. Animals for castration are usually brought to the dis- pensaries but more cattle might be operated on in villages with advantage and attention is being directed to the matter. Investigation. 19. During the year the subordinate staff submitted 470 specimens to the Sir Dinshaw Maneckjee Petit Patho Bacteriological Laboratory at Parel for diagnosis and 32 morbid specimens to the museum. It is proposed to equip a small laboratory at head-quarters for diagnostic and other work. There is considerable scope for investigation but a special staff is required to deal with it thoroughly. The question is under consideration. Veterinary Dispensaries. See Table V. 20. Two dispensaries were opened during the year, one at Muddebihál in the Bijápur district and one at Saundatti in the Belgaum district. There are 52 dispensaries at present. At least one is required in each táluka. Several District Local Boards are desirous of increasing the number of dispensaries in their districts and have applied for the necessary assistance. The shortage of qualified recruits for the department is delaying matters unfortunately. The total number of patients treated was 126,915 against 120,741 in the previous year. The figures denote steady and satisfactory progress. Of the above cases 44,656 were not brought for treatment but their owners were given advice and medicine. This method of treatment is not very satisfactory but it is unavoidable at present. New rules for the local management of dispensaries have been circulated and practically unanimously adopted. 21. During the year permanent buildings have been provided at Sátára, Anand and Gadag and the existing site and building at Chikodi (Belgaum) has been acquired with the help of grants from the Wadia Trust. The new dispensary at Bulsár is nearing completion. Part of the necessary funds have been provided through the liberality of Mr. Dhanbhura of Bulsár. It is pro- posed to provide new buildings at Sávda (East Khándesh), Bárdoli (Surat) and Bárámati (Poona) during the forthcoming year. Others are urgently required. The hired buildings in which many of the dispensaries are accommodated are unsuitable. The revised standard plans have been submitted to Government for approval and it is hoped that they will soon be issued. III.22 not furnished the necessary information so the table is incomplete. Local bodies do not interest themselves very much in cattle-breeding. When the cattle survey is completed and it has been decided exactly on what lines to proceed the matter will be brought to their notice. (ii) Bull-rearing and breeding farms and depôts. See Table IX. 23. The Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi, Ahmedabad District, which was handed over to the Civil Veterinary Department in 1906 was in charge of Mr. P. V. Nagarsheth throughout the year under report. Veterinary Assistant Gandhi was attached for training from October 1914. The receipts during the year amounted to Rs. 9,162 against Rs, 6,957 in the previous year. The increase is due to sale of hay and to a sum of Rs. 1,494 under "other heads" for the maintenance of a Brazilian cattle dealer's animals that are being kept at the farm. The expenditure was Rs. 17,899 against Rs. 18,465. There was an increase of Rs. 1,339 under feed and keep of animals owing to the expense entailed in keeping Mr. Borges's cattle. A sum of Rs. 1,297 was spent in hay-making against Rs. 2,286 in the previous year. Last year the expenditure under other heads included the capital cost of the materials for two new Dutch barns, viz. Rs. 4,295. In the year under report these were erected and other improvements the cost of which has been included under "other heads" were the re-roofing of the officer's bungalow at a cost of Rs. 1,200, the boring of a well at a cost of Rs. 416 and the construction of a silo pit for Rs. 559. A chaff cutter and a hay rake were purchased also. The work of planting a cactus fence round the boundary was finished. 24. The number of cattle, exclusive of those belonging to Mr. Borges, at the close of the year was 519, being an increase of 15. 107 calves were born during the year; 10 bulls, 12 bullocks and 2 cows were sold. In addition 32 female stock were cast and sold by auction. There were 36 deaths, 15 from natural causes and 21 from epidemic disease. Rinderpest broke out in April and August but was checked by means of inoculation and other preventive measures instituted personally by the Superintendent. A few cases of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Piroplasmosis also occurred. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia anti- serum was used with good effect. 25. At the close of the year under report there were 12,37,905 pounds of hay and 25,220 pounds of jowári-kárbi in hand; 4,85,000 pounds of hay were made and stacked. The decrease in the stock of hay of nearly two lacs pounds was due to more being sold and to less being made than usual. There is still a surplus stock and it is proposed to sell when the market is favourable. 26. It has been decided to keep a reserve of hay for use in times of famine at Chharodi in future. The proposal is to store 10,00,000 pounds each year and to keep 30,00,000 pounds in stock. The matter will be taken in hand as soon as funds are made available for the purpose. 27. The year has been a successful one financially. Permanent improve- ments involving capital expenditure are included in the current expenditure in Table IX and the fixed assets are not included in the valuation figures. The farm was established to preserve the Kankreji breed of cattle and selected herds are kept primarily for the production of bulls for stud purposes. The herds were gone through carefully during the year and classified. A few cows were eliminated. There is not a great demand for bulls and more could be supplied. Some of the male stock are being castrated and trained as bullocks for which there is always a good market. 28. The Farm was visited during the year by the Director of Agriculture, the Deputy Director of Agriculture, Northern Division, the Extra Deputy Director of Agriculture, Konkan Division, and by the Assistant Collector in charge of the Sánand Táluka. (2) Equines. (i) Horse and pony stallions. See Table X. 29. At the commencement of the year there were 37 stallions at work viz. 14 horses and 23 ponies. Two horses and four ponies were purchased and two were destroyed. Two
23 more stands were opened during the year, one at Deodar (Pálanpur Agency) and one at Chharodi (Ahmedabad District). 28 stallions were stationed in the Deccan and 13 in Gujarát. See Table XI. 30. Thirty-eight stallions were actually employed at the stud and they covered 1,589 mares against 1,543 in the previous year or an average of 41.51 each. The number of foalings is not known. It is practically impossible to find out. A number of useful foals by Government stallions have been inspected, however, both in the Deccan and in Gujarat and the services of the stallions appear to be generally appreciated by owners of mares. See Table XII. 31. The annual cost of feed and keep amounted to an average of Rs. 492 per stallion, as against Rs. 479 last year. The increase has been in the Deccan where prices of grain have ruled high. (ii) Donkey stallions. 32. There is no Government-aided mule breeding in the Presidency (3) Others. 33. There is nothing to report under this head but the question of endeavouring to improve the wool of the indigenous sheep of certain tracts by cross breeding is under consideration. Good results have been obtained in upper India from the importation of Merinos and the matter is worthy of attention. (4) Fairs and Shows. See Table XIII. 34. The Ahmedabad horse show was held in the first week of February. It was attended by the Superintendent who assisted on the Judging Committee. A grant of Rs. 2,500 and a silver medal were provided by Government and financial support was given also from local sources. Considerable local gratification was expressed that the Show had been revived. The entries were not so good as usual but the circumstances were special. Horse shows are useful to demonstrate the results of endeavours to improve the local animals. The Ahmednagar Horse Show was not held under the advice of the Collector. It is hoped to revive it in the forthcoming year. See Table XIV. 35. The annual cattle show at Sholápur was not held owing to the existence of plague. The Ahmedabad District cattle show was held at Talod at the end of January and a sum of Rs. 485 and two silver medals were distributed from Government funds. Grants of Rs. 150 and Rs. 100 were given also for cattle prizes at the Agricultural shows at Bijápur and Shirpur (West Khándesh), respectively. The shows at Talod and Bijápur were attended by the Superintendent and that at Shirpur by the Veterinary Inspector Násik Division. The members of the local veterinary staff are always detailed to attend shows and give every assistance as well as lectures and demonstrations. Prizes for cattle are only indicated in cattle-breeding tracts. It is doubtful if they do much to encourage intelligent cattle-breeding at present as most of the exhibitors are inclined to regard their receipt as fortuitous and not as emblems of the excellence of their produce. IV.24 Northcote Cattle Farm and 52 were in charge of dispensaries with touring duties in one or more tálukas in connection with epidemic disease and general veterinary work. At the close of the year there were 10 reserves who were attached to the larger dispensaries for training and for relief duty. As previously stated they were frequently employed for attending epidemics under the orders of the Veterinary Inspectors. During the year the sanctioned establishment of Veterinary Assistants has been under strength and on March 31st there were 3 vacancies. Recruits are not obtainable and at the time of the submission of this report there are no less than 12 vacancies. The matter has been represented to Government and it is hoped that it will be possible to provide suitable candidates in future. The progress of the department is much handicapped by lack of sufficient staff. 37. The work of the subordinate staff during the year has not been marked by any exceptional enterprise as a whole though many men have worked hard in connection with outbreaks as testified by the number attended and the inocula- tions performed. Endeavours have been made to bring home the fact that there is very great scope for originality and enterprise and that the future of the department depends upon the individual. Work in connection with out- breaks of contagious disease is of primary importance. Dispensaries are usually well conducted and good work is being done at many of them. Frequent absence is unavoidable especially when there is much disease in villages. It is necessary therefore for every veterinary assistant to see that his dispensary staff is well trained and capable of dealing with urgent and ordinary cases. Rules to make compounders more efficient have been recommended to local bodies. In addition to ordinary treatment of animals in villages Veterinary Assistants have now been required to make enquiries in regard to cattle-breeding and other kindred matters interesting to the department and even if no great results are to be immediately expected the educative value is important. 38. The sudden death of Rao Sáheb J. K. Bhatt on March 2nd was a great loss to the department. He was a popular and energetic officer. Veterinary Assistant (now Veterinary Inspector) P. V. Nagarsheth did very good work as Manager of the Cattle Farm and deserves his promotion. Veterinary Inspector Maniar who was appointed to the newly created Násik Division showed a good grasp of his work and applied himself energetically and intelligently. The following Veterinary Assistants did commendable work : A. D. Lopez (Poona), S. V. Soman (Sholápur), H. B. Shirsathe (Bárámati), J. G. Kulkarni (Hubli), B. B. Patel (Godhra), M. K. Garudachar (Sirsi), G. K. Mainkar (Málegaon). V.25 TABLE II. Showing the number of Deaths from Contagious Diseases amongst Animals during the year 1914-15. District. EQUNIES. BOVINES. Glanders.

Below letter No. 4288, dated 26th June 1915, from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona, to the Under Secre- tary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay. No. A.41 No. G.-290 OF 1915. GENERAL DEPARTMENT: Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karáchi, 1st July 1915. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the annual report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rájputána, on the work of the Veterinary Department in Sind during the year 1914-15. 2. Mr. Cattell, the Superintendent, was on leave for a part of the year during which period his office was held by Mr. Farbrother who remained as an attached officer for the rest of the year. Khan Sahib S, G. Haji held the post of the Deputy Superintendent throughout the year. He is a gazetted Assistant of the Superintendent and in future reports his work should be referred to along with that of other gazetted officers instead of under the head 'subordinate establishment.' It is satisfactory to note that a considerably larger amount of road touring was done by the Superintendent and his Assistants. In view of the remarks on this point, in last year's review of the work of the department, instructions were issued that all Veterinary Assistants should do a certain amount of touring every month apart from visits to villages for attendance on cases. The Commissioner is confident that the best results will ensue from these periodical visits if properly utilised. 3. The measures taken last year to overcome the difficulty of obtaining suitable candidates from Sind for the Bombay Veterinary College have been successful and the full complement of six Sindhi scholars, three of whom are Mahomedans, are now entered at the College. The acceptance of the proposals contained in the Commissioner's memorandum No. G.-386, dated 24th July 1914, for the improvement of the pay and prospects of the subordinate staff should overcome the difficulty experienced since the constitution of the depart- ment in inducing suitable Veterinary Assistants to serve in the province and in ensuring an adequate supply of Sindhi scholars of the proper stamp for the Bombay Veterinary College. 4. The mortality returns from contagious diseases show a remarkable advance over those of last year, the total figures being 2,560 and 1,062 respecti- vely. The disease which caused the greatest mortality was Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia among cattle, the reported figures being 1,407 as compared with 341 for the previous year. The Superintendent, however, states that too much reliance cannot be placed on the mortality statistics. Perhaps an explanation of the marked rise in the figures is to be found in the orders referred to in last year's report for the prompt intimation by the Revenue Department to Veteri- nary Assistants and superior Veterinary officers of the outbreak of cattle disease. The number of inoculations rose from 856 to 2984 there being only four fatalities after inoculation. The fact that several cattle owners who have had previous experience of inoculation came voluntarily forward to secure protection for their healthy cattle by this measure testifies to the growing confidence of the public in the work of the department. 5. The total number of in and out-patients treated at the various dispen- saries dropped from 16,013 to 15,706 although there were 11 dispensaries treating in-patients and 12 treating out-patients during the year as compared with eight and twelve respectively during 1913-14. The decrease in the figures is chiefly noticeable in the out-patients section at the dispensaries of Karáchi, Hyderabad, Shikárpur and Naushahro Feroze. The number of animals treated by Veterinary Assistants on tour also fell from. 2,918 to 2,554 although the num- ber of villages visited rose from 381 to 938. No explanation has been offered for the diminution in attendance in a year when epidemic diseases were prevalent in N 1542 every district of the province; but in the larger towns it may be attributed to the prevalence of plague which caused large numbers of the population to leave their homes. The three new dispensaries opened were at Mirpur Khas, Sujawal and Tatta. 6. The cattle show at Landhi was a new departure organized by the Karáchi District Local Board, but the superior officers of the Veterinary Depart- ment rendered valuable assistance to the Collector in contributing to the success of a movement which has in view the improvement and conservation of the Karáchi breed of milch cows. This important matter and the general question of the improvement of Sindhi cattle by means of the establishment of a cattle farm is receiving separate attention. 7. The development of the work of the department continued during the year and the Commissioner is pleased to note the Superintendent's commenda- tion of the work of the Deputy Superintendent Khan Sahib Haji.

Annual Administration Reports of the Bombay Veterinary College and the Civil Veterinary Department, including the Annual Adminis- tration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1914-15. No. 11426. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 28th October 1915. Letter from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 71-L., dated 5th June 19152 by each of the Veterinary Inspectors from men under training in his own division, seems likely to provide an effective reserve for times of epidemic and may also serve as a starting point for future developments. The Governor in Council entirely agrees with the Superintendent's opinion that the success of the Department depends largely upon the enterprise of individual workers and upon the success achieved by divisional officers in keeping in touch with local conditions and winning the confidence of local cattle owners. Two dispensaries were opened during the year, bringing the total number up to 52, and the number of patients treated directly or indirectly by these institutions rose from 120,741 to 126,915. By the death of Ráo Sáheb Bhatt the Department has lost the services of a valuable officer. 3. Sind like the Presidency showed a marked increase in the number of deaths from contagious disease, though the difference may be partly accounted for by improved methods of registration. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia was the cause of 1,407 deaths out of a total of 2,560. The number of inoculations rose from 856 to 2,984; but against this must be set an unexplained falling off in the number of animals treated at the dispensaries and by Veterinary Assistants on tour. An interesting experiment was made by the District Local Board of Karáchi in holding a cattle show at Landhi. Government will be ready to deal sympathetically with any proposals designed to further the improvement and conservation of the famous breed of Karáchi milch cattle. 4. As regards the Department generally Government notice with regret that progress has been handicapped both in Sind and the Presidency by recruiting difficulties and that the staff at the end of the year was a good deal below strength. As far as Sind is concerned, the scheme of reorganization to which Government have recently accorded sanction, should be effective in securing an adequate supply of officers of the right stamp. In the Presidency the proposal put forward by the Director of Agriculture to make the grant of scholarships at the college conditional on the scholars undertaking to serve for five years in the Civil Veterinary Department seems calculated to secure the same end and has the approval of Government. The administration of the Department during the year has been characterized by a degree of care and efficiency which is creditable to all concerned. J. A. POPE, Under Secretary to Government.

3 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. Mr. K. Hewlett, the Principal of the College, held charge throughout the year under report. The staff remained unchanged and continued on duty throughout the year with the exception of Mr. Phadke who was absent on furlough from 10th April to 2nd July while on military duty with horses on board ship on the voyage to Marseilles. 2. The students.4 7. This year there were 13 Government scholarships vacant on the 1st January, viz., 11 for youths from the Presidency Proper and 2 for youths from Sind. These vacancies were caused by 7 scholars having passed out of the College and 6 having failed at the Annual Examination. The Principal awarded 10 scholarships to applicants from the Presidency Proper and one scholarship to a student already in the College. The Commissioner in Sind awarded 1 scholarship to an applicant from Sind and 1 scholarship to a Sindi student already in the College. This year there were 25 applicants for the 11 scholarships. The Government of the Central Provinces continued the stipend to one student already in the College and awarded a stipend to a new student. The Government of Ceylon continued the stipend to their student. The States of Rádhanpur and Porebunder continued the scholarships to their students and stipendary students were sent by the following States :5 Embarkation Veterinary Officer unfit to proceed to their destination. These animals were to a large extent accommodated in the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals, a portion of which the Executive Committee continued to place at the Principal's disposal for this purpose. In this way 884 animals were treated during the year by the Principal assisted by Messrs. Shaikh and Miranda of the College Staff. Towards the close of the last and at the commencement of the present official year a considerable number of cases of ringworm among the remounts intended for shipment overseas accurred. A segregation camp for these horses was formed in a portion of the College grounds and another camp in a portion of Old Government House Grounds, Parel. These camps were placed in charge of Mr. Rebello of the Glanders and Farcy Department and Mr. Shaikh of the College Staff respective- ly assisted by a number of students, who acted as dressers under their orders. It was eventually decided to ship these animals together on a ship by them- selves and the Principal was asked to provide a Veterinary Officer and dressers. Mr. Phadke of the College Staff and four studeuts volunteered their services and accompanied the horses to France. During April and May there was an extensive outbreak of influenza among remounts which were then arriving in Bombay in considerable numbers. The horses from one train were unloaded at Kurla and segregated at Wakola and Mr. Shaikh of the College Staff was placed in Veterinary charge of this camp and did excellent work there in the sick line. The affected horses from the Cavalry Drafts Camp, Parel, were segregated at Worlee as well as in Parel Government. House Grounds, Messrs. Haji and Kadri of the Glanders and Farcy Department being placed in charge respectively. At the termination of the outbreak these horses were entrained under the supervision of the College officers. On several occasions the Embar- kation Veterinary Officer obtained assistance from Officers of the College in discharging his duties at the Docks and elsewhere when it was impossible for him to attend to his duties single-handed. Mr. Sowerby, Mr, Shaikh and Mr. Miranda assisted on several occasions in this way. The Principal was requested by the Quarter-Master-General in India to obtain the services of Graduates of Indian Veterinary Colleges to take veterinary charge of horses in transit to Europe and elsewhere and was able to make suitable arrangements for the veterinary supervision of 27 horse ships. Among the Graduates who volunteered for this purpose were the following servants of the Government of Bombay :6 APPENDIX A. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE. Results of Professional Examinations, 1915-1916.

From THE HON'BLE MR. G. F. KEATINGE, C.I.E., I. C. S., Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona ; To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 12th June 1916. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report of the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, for the year 1915-16. 2. The number of students at the College is well maintained, though the educational qualifications of the majority still remain low. The percentages of students who passed their examinations showed some falling off, especially in the case of the final year students. 3. Owing to the extra work thrown on the College Staff in connection with the war, the students' tour and the post-graduate class were abandoned; but the cheerful performance of their additional duties by the Principal, his staff and the students deserves appreciative notice. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture.
13 No. 179-L. OF 1916. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE : Parel, 6th June 1916. From K. HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Administration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1915-16. 2. During the year under report 33 horses were seized under the Act and taken to the Lazaretto as against 40 last year. Of these 21 were found to be diseased within the meaning of the Act and dealt with accordingly. Of the 21 diseased animals, 5 were cases of Glanders, 3 Epizootic Lymphangitis and 13 Surra. Besides the above cases a remount received from the 27th Cavalry, Secunderabad, was detained by the Embarkation Veterinary Officer on account of debility and sent to the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals. The animal developed Surra and was sent to the Lazaretto at Sewree and destroyed. 3.

17 No. 4704 OF 1916. From MAJOR G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., F.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, dated 27th June 1916. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1915-16. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. K. WALKER, Major, Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency- (Through the Director of Agriculture, Bombay, Poona). N 3219 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. Major G. K. Walker held charge of the department throughout the year under report. He was on tour for 166 days and travelled 13,412 miles by rail and 1,252 miles by road. In the course of his tours he visited 14 districts for investigation and inspection and interviewed district officers and others interested in the work of the department. He inspected 27 dispensaries and 7 stallion stands once or more and the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi 5 times. Special and other work included the following:20 mortality statistics however, which are prepared from statements submitted by Mámlátdárs and Mahálkaris, it may be remarked that the increase is probably more apparent than real. Since epizootic disease reports have been obtained from veterinary assistants as a routine there is a greater check on the submis- sion of the statistical returns resulting in greater accuracy. Municipal authorities except Bombay City have not furnished systematic returns up to the present, but this is to be remedied in future. As the department increases in strength and efficiency statistics will tend to exactitude which imports the discovery of more deaths than are at present reported. 7. During the year 1,820 outbreaks were attended by Veterinary Assist- ants and 87 by Veterinary Inspectors. Owing to shortage of staff it is not possible to visit all outbreaks but the increase in the number attended is satis- factory. Greater attention is being paid to this important work every year and valuable experience and information is being gained. 8. As stated in last year's report epizootic disease in cattle is mainly spread by movements of animals and in years of scarcity the danger is increased. It is doubtful if restriction of movements involving legislation is practicable at present. Equine contagious disease. 9. Five deaths in horses from glanders occurred in Bombay City. The rest of the Presidency was free of this disease. Surra was reported from seven districts and Bombay City. A number of animals kept at the Panjrapoles in the Thána District became affected with this disease and died. An arrangement has now been made with the Bombay Panjrapole authorities to keep equines at one Panjrapole in future where an isolation ward is being constructed. Bovine contagious disease. 10. Rinderpest.21 Contagious disease in other animals. 15. Contagious disease in other animals than equines and bovines is rarely- reported to this department. Pleuropneumonia and variola in goats and sheep and rabies in dogs are sometimes notified. Spirochætosis in fowls was observed at Dhárwár and diagnosed by the Veterinary Inspector. Preventive measures. See Table III. 16. Preventive inoculation against rinderpest and hæmorrhagic septi- cæmia was adopted generally with considerable success. The several " emergency corps " of reserves under Inspectors were frequently employed with advantage particularly in the Dhárwár and Kánara Districts where a large number of animals were inoculated. 79,706 inoculations against rinderpest were carried out in 421 outbreaks. It was ascertained that 448 inoculated animals died within 21 days of inoculation but many of these must have been in the incubative stage of the disease when inoculated. Accurate results are difficult to obtain owing to the vague reports of the owners. 6,555 uninoculated contact animals died. 17. It has been decided by Government that the expenditure on rinder- pest serum shall be limited to Rs. 15,000 per annum and it is proposed to concentrate our efforts on localities where cattle are valuable and where success is most likely to be obtained. A heavy expenditure at present in districts where the disease is enzootic and the cattle inferior does not appear to be justified. 18. Serum inoculation in 14 outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia was adopted with very satisfactory results only one death occurring in an inoculated animal, while 141 uninoculated animals died of the disease. The supply of this serum was limited or more inoculations would have been carried out. 19. Surveys are being conducted in regard to the incidence of hæmor- rhagic septicæmia and black quarter in certain localities with a view to the adoption of vaccination against these diseases. It has been demonstrated that, in regard to the latter disease especially, they are not so seasonal as was expected which adds to the difficulties of instituting vaccination. It is doubtful if very striking results can be hoped for but the matter is still under consider- ation and investigation. Other disease. See Table IV. 20. The number of villages visited by veterinary assistants during the year was 3,445 against 3,779 in the previous year. The decrease in the number is due to the fact that longer periods had to be spent in the villages affected with epizootics. A number of villages was visited in connection with the cattle survey that is being conducted by the staff and, in the case of new dispensaries, to acquaint the inhabitants with their existence. During their tours the veterinary assistants treated 27,481 cases for conta- gious diseases22 The brains of 20 dogs suspected to have died of rabies were extracted and sent to the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory for examination. Veterinary Dispensaries. See Table V. 22. A new dispensary was opened at Dhandhuka (Ahmedabad District). Several others have been proposed and sanctioned but for financial reasons have not yet been equipped and opened. The total number of patients treated was 139,748 at 53 Dispensaries against 126,915 at 52 in the previous year. There is steady progress in the number of patients treated and in the efficiency of the treatment provided. There is still a large proportion of cases not brought to the dispensary, advice and medicine being provided on the evidence of owners. This is unavoidable in many instances, but it should be discouraged as far as possible as treatment cannot be satisfactorily provided under such circumstances. 23. During the year the new dispensary at Bulsar was completed. An existing building at Islámpur (Sátára District) has been taken over by the District Local Board and adapted as a new veterinary dispensary. Some additions have been made at the Poona City Dispensary. Mr. D. P. Alur of Sirsi has generously offered to build a new dispensary at that place. No other dispensaries were built during the year. The Wadia Trust Fund, earmarked for the building of new veterinary dispensaries, was diverted to famine relief in Gujarát. When money is available it is expected that a number of new buildings will be provided as many of those in which dispensaries are now accommodated are unsuitable. Some existing buildings require alterations and additions. The new standard plans have now been published and distributed. They should be of great use in new projects and when making improvements. III.23 The decrease in the receipts was mainly due to the few sales of stock and the decrease in the expenditure to economy in capital outlay. Owing to the scarcity of fodder there was no demand for bulls or bullocks in Gujarát and a proposal to send some bullocks for sale to the south of the Presidency fell through. As one of the objects of the farm was the preservation of cattle in times of scarcity something was attained. If the year is normal a good demand is expected next autumn. It is hoped particularly that the District Boards of Gujarát will buy some stud bulls. Instead of buying any last year the District Boards of Ahmedabad and Kaira sent theirs to the farm to be kept. The increase of Rs. 951 under salaries of establishment is accounted for by travelling allowance being included under this head for the first time at the suggestion of the Auditor. Previously it had been shown under " other heads ". The actual rise in salaries amounting to Rs. 302 is made up of a personal allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem from December for the Manager, the pay of an acting Manager for 49 days and increments. The increase of Rs. 2,800 under "feed and keep" is not excessive considering that extra grain at swollen prices had to be given to a larger number of cattle. The expenditure under other heads " was for petty construction, appliances and contingencies. See Table IX. 26. The number of cattle exclusive of those of Mr. Borges was 572 at the close of the year being an increase of 53 head. There were only 71 births during the year which was not satisfactory. Many of the cows are old but they are being replaced and better results may be expected if favourable seasons are obtained. Only two bulls were sold. There were 16 deaths from various causes being a mortality of 2.8 per cent. One sporadic case of hæmorrhagic septicæmia was diagnosed. 27. No hay could be made during the year and only 387,093 pounds of hay and 2,920 pounds of jowári karbi remained at its close. This will be con- sumed on the farm by the end of June so that the replenishment of the stock of hay is dependent upon the forthcoming monsoon. 241,772 pounds of hay were sold during the year which included 13,600 pounds out of 100,000 placed at the disposal of the Collector of Ahmedabad at the moderate price of Rs. 12 per 1,000 for cultivators. The remaining 86,400 pounds of hay had still to be taken over at the end of the year. There were no receipts from cultivation or for the hiring of grass areas. 28. It was not possible to make any hay for the proposed fodder reserve sanctioned last year, but a large hay barn estimated to contain 600,000 pounds was constructed at a cost of Rs. 4,889 from a grant received from the Sir Sassoon David Trust Fund. A new mowing machine was also purchased from the same fund and a commencement made in clearing and levelling the hay making area for mowing by machines. 29. The year closed with an increase of Rs. 7,720 in the valuation of the stock and a decrease of Rs. 5,270 in the value of the grain and fodder in hand being a net increase in the liquid assets of Rs. 2,450. The expenditure on permanent improvements amounted to Rs. 294 only. The buildings which had been constructed in the past by the farm were taken over during the year by the Public Works Department. A stallion was kept at the farm for stud purposes for nine months of the year and his services were fully utilised. 30. The farm was visited by the Honourable Mr. Carmichael and the Director of Agriculture in addition to the Commissioner, the Collector and other district officers. (2) Equines. (i) Horse and pony stallions. See Table X. 31. There were 41 stallions24 32. During the year 40 stallions covered 1,784 mares against 38 and 1,589 in the previous year. See Table XI. The average number of mares covered by each stallion was 43.58. Enquiries regarding results are made by the veteri- nary staff and some of the stand officers but no statistics are available. See Table XII. 33. The annual cost of maintenance amounted to an average sum of Rs.488 per head against Rs. 492 in the previous year. There was a decrease in the cost in the Deccan which was complimented however by the enhanced prices which obtained in Gujarát. (ii) Donkey stallions. 34. There is no Government aided mule breeding in the Presidency. (3) Others. 35. Enquiries are still being made into the possibilities of improving the wool of the indigenous sheep by cross breeding. There is no doubt that there is a good market for finer wool at enhanced prices and it is considered that the Merino is likely to give the best results. The difficulty is to find any sheep breeders with the necessary enterprise. (4) Fairs and Shows. See Table XIII. 36. The Ahmednagar Horse Show was held in November after a lapse of five years. A grant of Rs. 1,000 and a silver medal were provided by Government but the grant was subsequently withdrawn for reasons of economy, the balance in hand and the local grants proving sufficient. The number of entries was 384 or 65 less than in 1910. This may be considered satisfactory as some of the intervening years had been prejudicial to stock rearing. It is hoped to obtain continuity of this show in future years but that is very dependent on the seasons. A separate report on the Show was submitted to Government. In consultation with the Collector it was decided not to hold the Ahmed- abad Horse Show owing to the local scarcity of fodder. It is greatly to be deplored that Shows in the Deccan and Gujarát have been so irregular of late years. See Table XIV. 37. The cattle shows at Sholápur and in the Ahmedabad District, which are aided by Government, were not held owing to the existence of plague and fodder famine respectively. A sum of Rs. 500 and 2 silver medals were provided by Government for the Mhaswad Cattle Show which was held in December and attended by the Director of Agriculture, the Collector and the Superintendent. A separate report was submitted in regard to it. A grant of Rs. 100 was given also for cattle prizes at the Agricultural Show at Sindkheda (West Khándesh District). The Lord Willingdon Milch Cattle Show at Belgaum was held in April but there was no Cattle Show at Bijápur. It is doubtful if the award of prizes at cattle fairs where the animals are merely brought for purposes of trade or at places where there are no breeders is likely to give much inducement to breeding. It is proposed to give prizes at small village shows in the breeding tracts in future if the necessary arrange- ments can be made and the necessary local enthusiasm fostered. The assist- ance of the Agricultural Department staff would be very helpful in this connection as this department is very short-handed.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT, Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karáchi, 27th July 1916. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, on the working of the Veterinary Department in Sind during the year 1915-1916. Charges. 2. Mr. J. G. Cattell held charge of the office of Superintendent for nearly the whole of the year upto the 12th March 1916, when he proceeded on short leave owing to ill-health and Khan Sahib S. G. Haji acted for him. Mr. E. S. Farbrother worked as attached officer under training upto the 13th July 1915, when he joined the Indian Army Reserve of Officers. Khan Sahib Haji held the post of Deputy Superintendent for Sind throughout the year. Tours of Officers. 3. The Superintendent's tour by road in Sind was not as extensive as in the previous year. In 1913-1914, when the Superin- tendent travelled 454 miles by road, the Commissioner remarked that more systematic road tours were essential in order to get into closer touch with stock-breeders and agriculturists. In 1914-15, there was a marked improvement when Messrs. Cattell and Farbrother between them, during the period that they respectively held the office of Superintendent, travelled 732 miles by road in Sind. In 1915-16, the Superintendent toured for 94 days only in Sind and travelled 459 miles by road. Mr. Cattell's illness towards the end of the year, his journey to Pusa to attend the Agricultural Conference and the visit to the Hissar Farm which together occupied sixteen days, and the week spent at Karáchi in January in connection with the arrange- ment at the Cattle-show, curtailed the extent of his Sind tour. Mr. Farbrother toured in Baluchistan only. The Deputy Superintendent, whose tour was as usual confined to Sind, travelled extensively by road in spite of several interruptions. The statistics indicate the good results attending the systematic monthly tours which veterinary assistants are now required to make in pursuance of the remarks made by the Commissioner on this point in his review of the work of the Department in the year 1913-1914. Sindhi scholarship-holders at the Bombay Veterinary College. 4. Of the six stipendiary Sindhi students studying at the Bombay Veterinary College, one of the two last year students passed the final examination in December 1915 and the other in April 1916. Both of them have been appointed Veterinary Assistants in Sind. Two more students were sent to the college from Sind. Of the six Sindhi students now studying in the College, four are Mahomedans and two Hindus. Officers are required for two dispensaries, one at Matli, where premises were constructed last year, and the other at Nawab- shah, where the dispensary was located in a hired building. These posts will be available for the two last year students who are expected to pass the final examination next December. Dispensaries. 5. The fulfilment of the programme for the construction of dispensaries outlined in the scheme sanctioned in Government Resolution, Financial Department, No. 1879, dated N 3244 the 26th May 1910, has been greatly retarded by the unfavourable financial situation. So far the following dispensaries have been constructed:45 Larkana, Sukkur and Upper Sind Frontier are concerting schemes for the maintenance of Arab stallions with the object of breeding an improved type of pony from unbranded Sindhi mares. It is hoped thus to raise to the Army Remount Department standard the numerous Sindhi mares which now fall below it and to provide a larger number of mares suitable for branding and covering by Imperial Stallions. The proposals have already been approved in the case of the Larkana District in Government Resolution, Revenue Depart- ment, No. 59, dated the 4th January 1916. General. 11. The work of the Department naturally falls into two main divisions, viz., internal working and organization and practical activity in the prevention and suppression of disease. The Department in Sind is still in the development stage ; satisfactory progress has already been made, but the arrangement under which three provinces comprising a vast area are placed under the supervision of a single Superin- tendent cannot be continued indefinitely; extensive railway journeys involve a waste of energy and are expensive. The practical results of the year's work may be regarded as satisfactory on the whole. Measures have been taken to secure prompt reports by the public and local officials of the outbreak of disease, and the efficacy of inoculation in saving cattle is beginning to be recognised in the countryside. H. S. LAWRENCE, Commissioner in Sind. To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. N 3247 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT IN SIND FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. G. Cattell held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, from 1st April 1915 to 12th March 1916, when he had to take leave on account of ill-health and Khan Sahib S. G. Haji, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, acted for him to the end of the year. Mr. Cattell was on tour in Sind for 94 days and travelled 2,733 miles by rail and 459 miles by road. He was on tour in Baluchistan for 80 days when he travelled 2,981 miles by rail and 373 miles by road. He also spent 16 days and travelled 2,964 miles by rail and 68 miles by road to attend a meeting of the Board of Agriculture in India held at Pusa and to study the working of the Government Cattle Farm at Hissar in the Punjab. During the year under report Mr. Cattell inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpur Khas, Dadu, Larkana, Jacobabad, Tatta, Sujawal and Shikarpur and the Army Remount Department stallion stables in the Larkana and Upper Sind Frontier districts. He toured under canvas in parts of the Larkana district. He attended and assisted on the Judging Committees at the horse show at Jacobabad, the cattle shows at Shikarpur and Karachi and the mule show at Larkana. When touring in the province the Superintendent checked the inoculation work performed by Veterinary Assistants and when possible attended outbreaks of epidemic disease. He made enquiries regarding cattle breeding in the province. He inspected several sites for a cattle breeding farm. From the 25th October 1915 the Superintendent had to undertake the control and management of all equine diseases in the Baluchistan Horse Breeding Circle in addition to his own duties which added largely to his work and responsibility. 2. Mr. E. S. Farbrother, I. C. V. D., remained attached to the Superin- tendent's office up to 13th July 1915, when he joined the Indian Army Reserve of Officers. He was on tour in Baluchistan for 40 days and travelled 2,180 miles by rail and 315 by road. 3. Khan Sahib S. G. Haji held the post of Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, throughout the year. He was on tour in the province for 151 days. He travelled 7,424 miles by rail and 1,240 miles by road and visited 103 villages. He inspected all the veterinary dispensaries in the province twice except those at Tatta, Sujawal and Kandhkot, which were inspected only once. The Deputy Superintendent checked inoculation work and attended outbreaks of disease when possible. He helped to make arrangements for and acted as a member of the Judging Committee at the Karachi Cattle Show. He also acted as a member of the Judging Committee in the cattle section at the Shikarpur Show. He toured in the Upper Sind Frontier and Larkana districts in order to make enquiries about the disease dourine. I.48 one subject and was to be re-examined in April 1916. Two more scholars were sent during the year under report, thus making a total of seven students at the College at the close of the year. II.49 17. Fluke disease.50 Investigation. 28. During the year the subordinate staffs in Sind and Baluchistan submitted a large number of specimens to the Superintendent for examination from suspected cases of surra, dourine, scab, anthrax, mange, black quarter and haemorrhagic septicæmia. Veterinary Dispensaries. See Table V. 29. There were 12 veterinary dispensaries work- ing in the province throughout the year. New dispensaries at Matli, Nawabshah and Mehar could not be opened as it was impossible to secure the services of suitable Veterinary Assistants. It is hoped that new dispensaries at Matli and Nawabshah can be opened shortly. The total number of in and out-patients treated at dispensaries was 15,662 against 15,706 in 1914-15. Medicine and advice were given to the owners of 3,479 cases which were not brought to the dispensaries, making a total of 19,141 animals treated and supplied with medicine against a total of 17,545 in the previous year. Rs. 271-6-0 were realized in fees at the Hyderabad dispensary and Rs. 4,701-10-0 as fees and shoeing charges at the Karachi dispensary. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries was 109 as compared with 69 animals castrated last year. Additions or alterations to dispensary buildings were carried out at Karachi, Tatta, Larkana and Dadu. The construction of dispensary buildings at Kandhkot has been postponed. Standard plans for veterinary dispensaries in Sind have been approved and are being printed. III.51 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay attended the show and presented a special prize for the best cow in the show. A Challenge Trophy for the best bull in the show was presented by Khan Bahadur Nusserwanjee R. Mehta of Karachi and handsome prizes were presented by Indian gentlemen of Karachi. A sum of Rs. 390 and two silver medals were awarded from Local Funds. The Shikarpur show was held in January. Three hundred and twenty- eight animals competed for prizes and a sum of Rs. 270 was awarded from Local Funds. The cattle shown were not of high quality. IV.53 TABLE II.

Annual Administration Reports of the Bombay Veterinary College and the Civil Veterinary Department in the Bombay Presidency, including Sind, and of the Glanders and Farcy Depart- ment in Bombay for 1915-16. GOVERNMENT of BOMBAY. REVENUE DEPARTMENT. Resolution No. 10779. Bombay Castle, 10th November 1916. Letter* from the Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, No. 1792 The total mortality during the year in the Presidency proper from conta- gious diseases amounted to 16,294 as against 9,378 cases in the previous year and 4,074 in 1913-14. There was however some decrease in mortality from anthrax and hæmorrhagic septicæmia, though black quarter claimed a much higher toll of victims particularly in the Ahmednagar District, while amongst equines there was a slight increase in surra. The number of veterinary dispensaries, increased during the year by one, was 53 in which 139,748 patients received treatment, an advance of over 10 per cent. on the figures of 1914-15. Another gratifying feature is the progress shown in the treatment of disease in outlying villages, 3,445 of which were visited during the year by veterinary assistants on tour. 27,481 cases of contagious and 16,124 cases of non-contagious disease received treatment, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 13,959 and 14,271. The increase is no doubt due partly to the prevalent epidemics but also indicates the growing popularity of veterinary treatment amongst the agricultural classes. It is a matter for regret that the department is still handicapped by paucity of staff though the number of veterinary assistants rose by 8 to 71. The services of three Inspectors were lent to the Military Department. 3. In Sind, as in the Presidency proper, there was a very marked rise in mortality from contagious disease, the number of deaths rising from 2,560 in the previous year to over 4,000. The increase was entirely due to the preval- ence of parasitic gastritis amongst sheep and goats. A welcome decrease however is noticed in mortality from hæmorrhagic septicæmia and also in deaths from surra among equines which fell from 163 last year to 8 in 1915-16. As a result of the reduced prevalence of the former disease, fewer animals were inoculated during the year. The number of vete- rinary dispensaries was not added to and the number of animals treated, 15,662, shows but little variation from the returns of the previous year. The Governor in Council however observes with satisfaction the very considerable and encouraging advance in the number of treatments administered on tour by veterinary officers who dealt with 8,570 animals in 1,652 villages compared with 2,554 animals in 938 villages in 1914-15. The necessity of preserving and improving the valuable breed of Karachi cattle was brought to the attention of breeders by the cattle show at Karachi at which His Excellency the Governor was present. The Governor in Council will watch with interest the development of the scheme for the establishment of a cattle farm for this purpose, towards the cost of which a generous dona- tion of Rs. 15,000 has been contributed by Seth Chellárám Dallumal. It is noted that the Veterinary Department and some of the District Local Boards have under contemplation a scheme for improving the type of pony bred in Sind. 4. The results of the year's work in the Veterinary Department give cause for satisfaction both in Sind, where the department is, as yet, in the develop- ment stage, and in the Presidency proper where, in particular, the energy shown in dealing with the serious epidemic of rinderpest reflects credit upon the Superintendent and his staff.

The number of students at the College has been steadily increasing and the demand for Veterinary education now appears to be in excess of the facilities available. The question of extending these facilities will have to be considered. Meanwhile it would appear advisable that candidates belonging to this Presidency should have first claim to admission. The students with educational qualifications admitted into the College show a steady improvement. 17 students graduated from the College. This number is smaller than last year but it is exclusive of the seven students who, owing to their deputation on duty on muleships from China, could not appear at the annual examination and were consequently examined at the supplementary examination held in April 1918 and passed. 3. Throughout the year the Principal and the College staff had to do much extra work owing to the continuance of the war. It is pleasing to note nine of the students also volunteered to provide veterinary staff for ships bringing mules from China to India. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture. N 2111 No. 230-L. of 1918. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE : Parel, 3rd August 1918. From K. HEWLETT, ESQUIRE, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit the Annual Administration Report of the Glanders and Farcy Department for the year 1917-18 dealing with the equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour. 2. Glanders.12 There were 6 consignments of Queensland horses. 11. The prevalence of glanders has caused a considerable increase in the work usually performed by the Glanders and Farcy Department, 3,790 animals having been subjected to the mallein test. It was found that the staff unaided could not cope with this work in addition to their inspection duties and the services of certain members of the staff of the Bombay Veterinary College had to be obtained. Khan Saheb Ahmed Shaikh and Messrs. Miranda and Lopez rendered valuable assistance in carrying out the tests. 12. Mr. Dubash, the Chief Veterinary Inspector of the Glanders and Farcy Department, has worked with energy throughout the year and has performed his duties to my satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, K. HEWLETT, I.C.V.D., Principal, Bombay Veterinary College.

Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1917-1918.

17 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1917-18. Lieut.-Colonel G. K. Walker held charge of the department throughout the year. He was on tour for 121 days and travelled 11,404 miles by rail, 1,003 by road and 40 miles by sea. He visited 13 districts, inspected 24 dispensaries and 6 stallion stands once, or more, and interviewed district officers and others in regard to the work of the department. He also investigated several outbreaks of contagious diseases. He visited the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi 5 times. He acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Ve- terinary College in April and November. He inspected sites for the proposed Cattle farms at (1) Bankapur (Dharwar District), (2) Sangola (Sholapur Dis- trict), (3) Lonand (Satara District), (4) Sulia (West Khandesh) and visited Tegur Farm (Dharwar) once. He attended a conference at Simla and acted as a mem- ber of the Board of Agriculture at Poona. He visited Bombay several times for purchasing stallions and also visited Capt. Crawford's Horse Breeding Farm at Sirur. He visited the Cattle Insurance Society at Borbhatta in Broach District once and attended the I. D. F. Camp of exercise. 2. Mr. J. D. Buxy held the post of the Deputy Superintendent and Per- sonal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year. He was 108 days on tour and travelled 7,255 miles by rail, 1,787 miles by road and 150 miles by sea. He visited 16 districts and inspected 42 dispensaries and 12 stallion stands. and attended several outbreaks of equine and bovine contagious diseases in the- course of his tours. He attended the first village show at Gondawle in the Sa- tara District and visited the Mhaswad Cattle Fair to purchase premium bulls. He- investigated an extensive outbreak of surra in the Kanara and Dharwar districts. He checked the work of Veterinary Assistants on tour and inspected various Panjrapoles, Cattle markets, Dairies and slaughter houses. He visited the Northcote Cattle Farm once. I.18 Equine contagious disease. 5. Ninety-one cases of glanders were reported, all from the Bombay City. Surra was reported from 8 districts and from Bombay City. There were 230 deaths as against 56 in the previous year. Thana District was most severely affected. Several cases occurred at the Chembur Panjrapole ; these were iso- láted and treated but without success. As equine diseases are very rarely reported by the revenue officials, these figures cannot be regarded as a complete indication of their prevalence. Bovine contagious disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all the districts except Ahmedabad and Panch Mahals. As already mentioned all the Gujarat districts were practically free from this disease. The total mortality was 13,944 against 18,502 last year. Although the disease was not so widespread as in the previous year it appears to have been of a more virulent character, the percentage of mortality being 53'22 against 48.9 the previous year. As usual the Konkan districts were most severely affected. 7. Foot and mouth disease was reported in all districts except Dharwar. In all 349 deaths occurred against 284 last year. Mortality from this disease is generally confined to young stock and is due to the neglect of the complications to which it renders them liable. Much benefit accrues to the public by the treatment of this disease by the Veterinary Assistants and their services for this purpose are much sought after. 8. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia was widely prevalent affecting all the districts of the Presidency except the City of Bombay. 5,323 deaths were reported against 2,229 in the previous year. The most severely affected districts were Kaira, Surat and Belgaum. 523 outbreaks were attended by the Veterinary staff and the diagnosis of the disease was confirmed microscopically in 178 cases. 9. Black-quarter was prevalent in 12 districts and caused 848 deaths. As usual it was confined to the Deccan and Karnatic districts. The disease was somewhat severe in the Sholapur and Ahmednagar districts. 106 outbreaks were attended and the diagnosis was confirmed microscopically in 36 instances. 10. Anthrax prevailed in 8 districts and caused 158 deaths. Twenty-eight outbreaks were attended by the Veterinary Assistants and the diagnosis was confirmed by microscopical examination in 4 outbreaks. 11. Other contagious disease in bovines includes pleuro-pneumonia and dengue. Contagious disease in other animals. 12. Some cases of suspected bilharziosis in sheep was detected but the diagnosis was not confirmed. Also a few cases of spirach19 15. In 7 outbreaks of anthrax in the Kanara District 1,426 inoculations were carried out. Inoculations against anthrax are carried out only where the diagnosis of the disease has been confirmed microscopically. Forty-two unin- oculated animals died during the course of outbreaks, whereas none of the inoculated animals died. 16. Vaccination against Hæmorrhagic septicæmia was carried out in 34 villages where this disease is known to recur and 4,784 animals were treated in this way, of which only 1 died. 17. Vaccination against black-quarter was carried out at the Tegur Farm, Dharwar District, where 78 animals were vaccinated. Other disease. Table IV. 18. The number of villages visited by Veterinary Assistants during the year was 3,132. The decrease was due to reasons already given in the last year's report. The Veterinary Assistants treated 29,611 cases of contagious disease and 15,304 for non-contagious diseases during their tours. The decrease in the treatment of contagious diseases was due to the fact that foot-and-mouth and rinderpest were less prevalent. 1,137 animals, mainly cattle, were castrated by the Veterinary Assistants on tour against 258 last year. This increase must be regarded as satisfactory in view of the strong prejudices that exist against castration, and it shows that the superiority of a proper surgical operation compared with the more inhumane methods of emasculation usually resorted to is being appreciated. Investigation. 19. Five hundred and sixteen specimens were sent to the Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for diagnosis and 34 for the museum. One case of Johne's disease was detected in a buffalo belonging to the Agricultural Dairy Farm, Poona. This is the first time the disease has been discovered in the Presidency but it is probably much more prevalent than hitherto realised, and it will be made the subject of further investigation. Major Liston, C.I.E., the Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory at Parel, detected schistosomiasis in cattle, sheep and goats at the Bandra slaughter house and Veterinary Assistant K. B. Nair of this department was deputed to assist Dr. Soparkar in the investigation. It is probable that the disease is widely prevalent and enquiries are being instituted. The Superintendent is indebted to Major Liston and the members of his staff for their help in this matter. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 20. There were 54 dispensaries in the Presidency during the year. The total number of cases treated was 161,211. The new method of recording these cases shows that 83,461 animals were actually treated at the hospitals while medicines were supplied for 77,750 cases to be treated at their homes. Last year the total number of cases treated was 161,668. There is no doubt that the prevalence of plague influences the attendance at the veterinary dispensaries and that but for the severity of this disease during the year, the number of cases treated would have been much greater instead of slightly less than last year. This was specially observed in the Gujarat districts. 21. No new dispensaries were opened during the year but arrangements were completed to open 7 in April of 1918. Sanction has been accorded to the construction of dispensaries on the standard plan at Baramati, Poona District, Savada, East Khandesh, and Pandharpur, Sholapur District. The construc- tion of a dispensary at Barsi, Sholapur District, has been taken in hand. The funds for this work has been partly provided from the Wadia Trust. 22. More dispensaries are urgently required but owing to paucity of funds many District Local Boards are reluctant to undertake their share in their maintenance. This interferes with the progress of the department and a remedy is required if it is to approach anything like meeting public require- ments in a reasonable time.
20 III.21 villagers. There are many good buffaloes on the confines of the farm and the bull supplies a great want and his services are being fully utilized. 30. During the, year 8,00,000 lbs. of hay was secured for farm use and 1,00,000 lbs. of grass was made into ensilage by the farm establishment supple- mented by daily labour. Besides the above, 10,00,000 lbs. of hay were secured under the fodder reserve scheme ; it is stacked loose in the barns owing to difficulty in procuring wire for baling. This is the second instalment towards the 30,00,000 lbs. which it is proposed to hold in reserve. The work of harvesting is carried out as economically as possible and with the extension of the use of machinery which has proved very successful on the farm the cost will be still further reduced in future. During the year 59,195 lbs. of hay from the fodder reserve was sold at Rs. 12 per 1,000 lbs. for the use of Government stallions. 31. The proposed well boring operations were again held in abeyance for another year. 32. A stallion was kept as usual for 9 months at the farm, being sent back to Ahmedabad during the rains. During his stay at the farm he covered 63 mares. This stallion stand is becoming very popular. 33. The farm was visited by many officials and others, both from British territories and Native States, the hay-making operations creating considerable interest. (2) Equines. (i) Horse and Pony stallions. Table X. 34. At the beginning of the year 40 stallions, viz., 18 horses and 22 ponies, were employed at stud. One horse was destroyed and one died during the year. Six horses were purchased. A new stand was opened at Viramgam in Ahmedabad District. Twenty-nine stallions were stationed in the Deccan and 15 in Gujarat. Table XI. 35. During the year 1,924 mares were covered against 1,804 in the previous year. The average number covered per stallion was 46.94 against 45.27. Table XII. 36. The average annual cost of maintenance of stallions amounted to Rs. 424 per head against Rs. 455 in the previous year. The decrease is satisfactory. Only in the Sholapur District is an increase in the cost of maintenance to be noted and in that case it was due to necessary expenditure on the stables. (ii) Donkey stallions. 37. There is no mule-breeding in the Presidency. (3) Others. 38. Lieut.-Col. O'Brien, the Administrator of Porbandar State, obtained 4 Merino rams from Australia with a view to crossing the indigenous ewes with them. From his report they seem to have come through their first tupping season in the spring very well but the summer heat proved very trying for them and they all succumbed during the autumn to some form of lung disease con- tracted during the monsoon. Out of 26 lambs born of the spring tupping, only 8 survived and these are said to be doing well now. It is regrettable that the experiment should have proved such a failure and it indicates that the most scrupulous care must be exercised in the management of imported rams in this country. (4) Fairs and Shows. Table XIII 39. As in the previous year the Ahmednagar Horse Show had to be abandoned owing to the prevalence of plague. No provision was sanctioned for the Ahmedabad Horse Show. N 2122 Table XIV. 40. This is the first year in which Cattle Shows, as sanctioned by Govern- ment in their Revenue Department Order No. 5717, dated 8th May 1917, were organised. Owing to severity of plague in Gujarat all the shows proposed to be held in that tract had to be abandoned but a satisfactory start has been made in the Deccan. Two shows were held in the Satara District at Gondavle Budruk and Mhaswad in the Man Taluka. Six shows were held in the Sholapur District at Mangewadi, Wadhegaon, Rajuri, Waki, Mahud Budruk, and Lotewadi in the Sangola Taluka. It is too early to say what the results may be, but they certainly excited a considerable amount of local interest and keenness on the part of exhibitors. On the whole the commencement must be regarded as very satisfactory. The number of shows will gradually be increased in suitable cattle breeding areas according as ex- periment proves a success.

33 REVIEW BY THE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE. Below letter No. 2123, dated 27th June 1918, from the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona, to the Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay. No. 8569 of 1918. Poona, 9th October 1918. Submitted to Government in the Revenue Department. 2. Rinderpest though still severe, was less prevalent than in the preced- ing year. The mortality occurred mainly in the Districts of Thana, Kolaba and Kanara where large numbers of poor stock subsist simply by virtue of jungle grazing. In other Districts such as Poona, Satara and Dharwar where the mortality was moderately heavy a large number of the deaths took place in the western tracts where the conditions as to fodder supply approximate to those of the Konkan. The inoculation campaign was fairly extensive, but the cost of the serum now sets a limit to its indiscriminate use. It is clear from the figures that it affords a large measure of protection. 3. The losses from Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia were considerable, and the quality of the animals which suffer from this disease is superior to that of the animals which run up the figures for rinderpest. It is satisfactory to note that the campaign of inoculation and vaccination for this disease was largely extended and showed good results. This is a line of work which probably has a good future before it, and should be vigourously pushed on. 4. The number of Veterinary dispensaries remained the same as the year before. Provincial funds have not been plentiful of recent years, but the real check to the expansion of the Department arises from the scarcity of local funds. Government supply the services of the Veterinary officers and the whole cost of Superintendence. They also provide from one fourth to one half of the cost of other current expenditure at the Dispensaries ; while building- operations are financed in equal shares by Government, the Wadia Bequest Fund and the Local Bodies concerned. In spite of this many Local Bodies are finding themselves unable to provide for the enhanced expenditure which any expansion would entail. The total expenditure in connection with Veterinary work and breeding entailed on Local Bodies now amounts to Rs. 79,000, which works out at about Rs. 4,000 a district. This is not a large sum but it seems to indicate almost the limit of their powers, and unless financial assistance can be secured from other quarters, it is difficult to see how the programme of expansion can proceed. The Dispensaries continued to do useful work. 5. The services of the stallions are well utilised, and a start was made in putting out premium bulls and in holding small village cattle shows. A severe epidemic of plague and the economic disturbance caused by the War prevented as vigourous a campaign in this direction as might have been wished, but the new departure promises success and will be pushed on as circumstances offer. 6. The Chharodi farm is doing well, and the fodder operations there afforded considerable relief to the neighbouring breeders during the past year when fodder was scarce, and will be of greater use during the present season when we are faced with a more serious fodder famine. We are ready to open a fresh centre for fodder storage in the Kaira District when funds permit. The Chharodi farm has now made a start in rearing bull buffaloes of good strain. This is an important matter to the milk industry of Upper Gujarat, and is at present much neglected. The small cultivator who keeps one or two milk buffaloes finds it difficult to secure the services of a good sire, and the start now made promises good results. 7. Col. Walker supervised the work of the Department with his usual care till he went on leave in April, and since then Mr. Taylor has carried it on efficiently. G. F. KEATINGE, Director of Agriculture. N 2135 No. G.-160 OF 1918. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 21st August 1918. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, on the working of the Veterinary Department in Sind during the year 1917-18. Charge. 2. The charge of the office of the Superintendent was held throughout the year by Mr. J. G. Cattell except for a short period when Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji acted. Tour. 3. During the year under report the Superintendent's tour was fairly good. The Deputy Superintendent's tour was not as extensive as it should have been. Mortality statistics. 4. The total reported mortality from contagious diseases was 5,686 against 3,326 deaths reported in the previous year. Inoculation. 5. Preventive inoculations against rinderpest were carried out in 18 out- breaks against 30 in the previous year and the figure of inoculations rose from 1,610 to 2,261. Professional work. 6. The number of cases treated at dispensaries rose from 17,060 to 19,213: but the number of animals treated by Veterinary Officers on tour decreased from 3,719 to 3,334. Floods and sickness interfered with the tours of the Veterinary Assistants. Sind scholars at the Bombay Veterinary College. 7. The result of the last examination has been very satisfactory. Of the 6 Sind scholars who appeared at the examination, 2 passed the final examination, 1 passed the 2nd grade and 2 passed the 1st grade examination. Only 1 failed in the 2nd grade. This year one candidate only was admitted. Two were rejected by the Principal, Veterinary College, on account of defective eye- sight. Correspondence between the Commissioner and the Principal has now led to a satisfactory arrangement for the examination and admission of Sindhi scholars. Dispensaries. 8. No new dispensaries were opened during the year under report, but it is hoped that during the current year two dispensaries at Kandhkot and Nawabshah will be constructed. Breeding operations. 9. The breeding operations in Sind seem to be progressing favourably. The Arab stallion maintained by the District Local Board, Larkana, covered 53 mares during the year under report. The Larkana District Local Board have now 2 Arab stallions. The question of the establishment of District Local Board stallions has been fully considered, and it has been found that Arab stations are the most likely to secure a suitable class of remounts. Pony breeding in place of mule breed- ing will increase the supply of police remounts. As desired by Government, Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji has been instructed to take up the preparation of the note on the cattle breeds of Sind, and it is hoped it will be ready by the end of next cold weather for submission to Government. Two Tigris rams and 6 ewes sent by the Basra authorities for breeding purposes were sent to the Agriculture Farm at Landhi. Six lambs were born 3 ewes succumbed to a double parasitic infection. All the 6 lambs died. The remaining 3 ewes and 2 rams were in poor condition and were brought to Karachi in May last for treatment in the Karachi Veterinary Dispensary. The results so far cannot be considered satisfactory. Willingdon Cattle Farm. 10. The selection of the Farm depends upon the supply of water. The experimental water boring operations by the Agricultural Engineer are in progress.
36 Fairs and shows. 11. In view of the principles underlying Government Order No. 5717, dated the 8th May 1917, in connection with cattle breeding, steps are being taken to organize more cattle shows at suitable centres. During the year cattle shows were held at Mirpur Khas, Ghotki and Sujawal and the Commissioner sanctioned Rs. 500 and 100 respectively for prizes at each of the two latter shows. Financial. 12. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 83,500 as compared with Rs. 72,700 in the previous year. General Remarks. 13. The difficulties of the administration of the Veterinary Department in Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana by a single officer have been recognised by the authorities in each of these areas and the question of control in Sind by a full-time Superintendent and other proposals were referred to Government in January last for their consideration.

During the year Veterinary Assistants visited 1,405 villages and treated 1,918 animals for contagious and 1,416 for non-contagious diseases. Eighteen animals were castrated by the Veterinary Assistants on tour. In the previous year Veterinary Assistants visited 1,421 villages, treated 2,359 animals for contagious and 1,360 for non-contagious diseases and castrated 12 animals. Investigation. 42. During the year the subordinate staff from Sind and Baluchistan submitted a large number of specimens to the Superintendent for examination from suspected cases of surra, dourine, scab, parasitic gastritis and black quarter. Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. See Table V. 43. There were fourteen veterinary dispensaries working in the province at the beginning of the year 1917-18 and no new dispensary was opened during the year. The total number of patients treated at dispensaries was 19,213 against 17,060. Medicine and advice were given to the owners of 3,626 cases which were not brought to the dispensaries, making a total of 22,839 animals treated and supplied with medicine against a total of 20,008 animals treated and supplied with medicine in the previous year. Rs. 339-7-0 were realized in fees at the Hyderabad veterinary dispensary, Rs. 670-0-0 at the Shikarpur dispensary and Rs. 5,886-10-0 as fees and shoeing charges at the Karachi dispensary. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries was 112 as against 78 in the previous year. For want of funds no new dispensaries could be built during the year. Some minor additions and alterations to dispensary buildings were carried out at Larkana, Dadu and Naushahro-Feroz. The work of constructing a water-tight serum pit at Sujawal was begun at the close of the year. It is estimated to cost about Rs. 1,300 and the whole amount will be paid from Provincial revenues.

This year there were 19 Government scholarships vacant on 1st January, viz., 14 for youths from the Presidency Proper and 5 for youths from Sind. These vacancies were caused by 6 scholars having passed out of the College and 9 scholars having failed to pass in the Annual Examination and 3 scholarships having been withdrawn from students on account of their having given up the course on account of ill-health, etc., and 1 scholarship was vacant from the commencement of the Session. The Principal awarded 14 scholarships and the Commissioner in Sind 5 scholarships. The Central Provinces Govern- ment sent 2 new scholars and continued the scholarships to 2 students already in the College. The following States continued to maintain scholars and sent some new scholars : Gwalior continued 1 and sent 2 new scholars, Indore continued 3 and sent 1 new scholar, Rewa continued 2, Bhavnagar and Porbandar each continued 1, Mysore continued 1 and sent 6 new scholars, the Nizam's Govern- ment continued 8 and sent 1 new scholar and awarded 1 scholarship to a student already in the College. Besides these the Lingayat Education Associa- tion continued scholarships to 3 students. There were thus 62 students in receipt of some assistance from scholarships and 42 without such assistance. 8.

No. 2231 OF 1919. Poona, 1st July 1919. From Lieut-Colonel G. K. WALKER, C.I.E., O.B.E., F.R.C.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency; To THE Under SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1918-1919. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. K. WALKER, Lieut.-Col., Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency.
15 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1918-19. Lieut.-Colonel G. K. Walker was in charge of the Department for the first two days of April and from the 17th December 1918 to the 31st March 1919. During his absence Mr. Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, held charge until relieved by Mr. Taylor on the 9th April. The Superintendent was on tour for 161 days (Lieut.-Colonel Walker 60 and Mr. Taylor 101) and travelled 12,724 miles by rail and 2,078 by road. He visited 15 districts, inspected 26 dispensaries and 10 stallion stands once or more, and interviewed district officers and others interest- ed in the work of the Department. Lieut.-Colonel Walker, since his return from leave, was considerably engaged in advisory work connected with the feeding of cattle in famine tracts and at cattle camps and panjrapoles. The Superintend- ent investigated several outbreaks of contagious disease. He visited the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi six times and inspected sites for the pro- posed cattle farms at Bankapur (Dharwar District) and Sulia (West Khandesh) He conducted the supplementary examination at the Bombay Veterinary College in April and acted as President of the Board of Examiners in December. He attended the Science Congress at Bombay in January and the Veterin- ary Conference at Lahore in March. He also attended a conference of magistrates at Bombay regarding the application of the "Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act" in that city Mr. Taylor attended the I. D. F. Camp of Exercise. 2. Mr. J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year. He was 34 days on tour and travelled 4,477 miles by rail, 619 miles by road and 148 miles by sea. He visited 7 districts and inspected 13 dispensaries and 3 stallion stands. He attended several outbreaks of equine and bovine contagious disease in the course of his tours. He visited the panjrapoles of Ahmedabad to report specially on the cattle maintained there and their fodder requirements. His touring work was interfered with considerably owing to the heavy nature of his duties at head- quarters. I.16 Bovine contagious disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all the districts except Kaira. The number of deaths was 8,597 against 13,944 in the previous year, and the percent- age of mortality was 48.4. The Konkan districts were as usual the most severely affected, but there was a severe outbreak in the Ahmedabad District (Dhandhuka Taluka and Gogha Peta). 7. Foot and mouth disease was existent in all the districts except Panch Mahals. Its greater prevalence than usual may be attributed to animals being moved more extensively for grazing. 8. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia was reported from 14 districts only and was comparatively mild in its ravages, only 689 deaths being reported against 5,323 last year. It is always less prevalent in dry seasons. Preventive measures for dealing with this disease have been markedly successful since their introduction three years ago. 9. Black-quarter accounted for 273 deaths in nine districts. It is enzootic in the Deccan, but in dry seasons it is rarely severe. Diagnosis was confirmed microscopically in 13 outbreaks out of 48 attended. 10. Anthrax was reported from five districts and Chharodi Farm, causing 185 deaths. Twenty-four outbreaks were attended and the diagnosis was microscopically confirmed in three cases. Frequently specimens cannot be taken owing to the late arrival of the veterinary assistants. 11. Other contagious disease in bovines includes variola and mange. Contagious disease in other animals. 12. No deaths under this head were reported by the revenue officials. Fifty-four cases of suspected rabies claimed the attention of the veterinary staff and 25 brains were sent for examination to the Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel. Preventive measures. Table III. 13. The number of inoculations against rinderpest amounted to 26,836 in 249 outbreaks against 35,380 in 288 outbreaks last year. During the course of the outbreaks 3,895 uninoculated animals and 148 inoculated animals died. The work in this respect was satisfactory so far as it went, but there is still much apathy and prejudice in some localities and veterinary assistants have considerable difficulty in getting the treatment adopted. 14. Inoculations were carried out in four outbreaks of hæmorrhagic septicæmia, 1,146 animals being treated. In eight villages 1,035 animals were vaccinated against the disease. Among the inoculated animals there was only one death, while 96 uninoculated animals died during the course of the disease. There was no death among the vaccinated animals. When employed correctly and wisely, vaccine and serum treatment in hæmorrhagic septicæmia is very valuable and this has been recognised by the readiness to pay charges in some instances. A small beginning in this direction has been made though it is naturally not popular. Nevertheless the time must come for treatment of all kinds to be paid for directly and not indirectly as at present. 15. Inoculations against anthrax were carried out at the Chharodi Farm and in the Kanara District, 402 being performed. There were no deaths in the inoculated animals, whilst 16 uninoculated animals died during the course of the outbreaks. 16. Ninety animals were vaccinated at the Tegur Cattle Farm (Dharwar District) against black-quarter and one died of the disease afterwards. Other disease. Table IV. 17. The number of villages visited by 61 veterinary assistants was 3,301 against 3,132 by 54 last year. They treated 41,931 cases of contagious disease and 10,724 non-contagious cases during
17 their tours. The number of castrations performed on tour was 771. The increase in the number of contagious disease cases is due to the greater preva- lence of Foot and Mouth disease and the decrease in the number of non- contagious cases and castrations to seasonal conditions. Investigation. 18. During the year 253 specimens were sent by veterinary assistants to the Sir Dinshaw Manekji Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination and seven for the College museum. The decrease is due to the lesser prevalence of hæmorrhagic septicæmia. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 19. New dispensaries were opened during the year at Sakri (West Khandesh), Sheogaon (Ahmednagar), Haliyal (Kanara), Kolad (Kolaba), Wada and Bandra (Thana), and Jambusar (Broach). More are needed to carry out the expansion of the Department according to the approved programme, but District Local Boards plead paucity of funds with discouraging freedom. Including the new dispensaries the number at work was 61 against 54 last year. The number of cases treated was 75,366 against 83,461 last year, while medicines were supplied to 61,060 cases against 77,750. The decrease is due to the adverse season which was exceptionally severe on both human beings and animals. A large number of cattle have been sold or have died. During the influenza epidemic animals were neglected by their owners. Charges for treatment have been more freely introduced and they are apt to affect the attendance. Their gradual introduction is indicated. A. total sum of Rs. 8,934 was realised from fees against Rs. 6,797 in the previous year. 20. No new hospital buildings were occupied during the year but those at Savda (East Khandesh) and Barsi (Sholapur) are nearing completion. At Baramati (Poona) and Pandharpur (Sholapur) new hospitals are to be con- structed shortly. Owing to the enhanced prices the amount of money available from the Wadia Trust and Government for the building programme has been considerably underestimated and unless a special grant is given further construction will be impossible for some time. This is most unfortunate as new hospital buildings are urgently required in every district of the Presidency. In some places small additions and improvements are being made from local sources, but a comprehensive building programme is urgently required. III.18 It suffered severely from lack of rain and consequent scarcity of grazing. No crops could be grown and no hay could be made. The cost of feeding the cattle was heavy. 24. The receipts amounted to Rs. 18,850 against Rs. 10,984 in the previous year. These receipts do not include those of the fodder reserve scheme which are dealt with separately below. The increase was due to larger sales and to the levy of grazing fees for outside cattle, which were allowed to maintain themselves on the rough grass available in certain areas of the Farm. Eleven bulls were sold to the Java Government and ten premium bulls were issued at one-fourth of their usual price. A sum of Rs. 1,275 should be added to the credits on the latter transaction. 25. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 24,584 against Rs. 15,722, the increase being due to the enhanced cost of concentrated food stuffs. 26. The year closed with an increase of Rs. 1,565 in the valuation of the stock, which was more than counterbalanced by a decrease of Rs. 5,398 in the value of the grain and fodder in hand. There was a net decrease of Rs. 3,833 therefore. 27. The number of cattle on the Farm at the end of the year was 641 against 612 at the end of the previous year. If the ensuing season is normal there will be a strong local demand for cows and bullocks and the Farm will be in a position to supply a considerable number to replenish herds that have been depleted, a sufficient justification for the expense involved in main- taining animals in a famine year. Sixty-six animals were sold during the year and 45 died. Outbreaks of rinderpest, hæmorrhagic septicæmia and anthrax occurred but were promptly dealt with and only 22 died from epizootic disease. The number of deaths, viz. 23, from natural causes including non-conta- gious disease and accidents appears high, but many were due to old age. There were 128 births compared to 134 in the previous year. The percen- tage of calvings has again dropped. Abnormal seasons have much to answer for in this connection. 28. The services of the buffalo bull kept for stud purposes were not utilised very much owing to the year being unfavourable. Twelve young buffalo bulls were purchased from the Military Dairy Farm, Poona, with a view to issuing them to the districts on attaining maturity. 29. Owing to the failure of the rain no hay nor ensilage could be made during the year under report and the Farm reserves have been used up. The fodder reserve supply which had accumulated for two years and which amounted approximately to 200,000 lbs. was sold to cultivators at rates approved by the Director of Agriculture. Hay was also supplied from the Farm to the Ahmedabad Municipality, the Government Farm at Surat and certain stallion stands. A sum of Rs. 14,318 was realised on account of the sale of the hay, which amount would have been made larger if the market rate had been obtained. The cost of the hay was Rs. 12,990, but this sum includes the cost of a Dutch barn and hay making implements now in hand. Against this it must be stated that a large proportion of the hay was unbaled. Experience at the Farm proves that with labour saving devices hay can be made cheaply and well in normal years. There is room for development in methods, but good progress has been made in adopting hay making implements. Suitable baling machinery is an urgent requirement. 30. A stallion was kept at the Farm for three months, during which time he covered 14 mares. 31. The scheme for establishing a cattle farm on the site obtained at Bankapur in the Dharwar District has progressed to the extent that plans and estimates have been prepared for the necessary buildings. The question of a satisfactory water-supply is not settled and is holding the scheme up. The project has now been handed over to the Director of Agriculture to deal with.
19 32. Cattle farms are required in the Sholapur and West Khandesh Dis- tricts for the Khillari and Tapti Khillari breeds respectively. Certain inquiries and investigations have been made and Lieut.-Colonel Walker has selected a site for a farm in West Khandesh. His proposals have been forwarded to the Director of Agriculture. A site for a farm near Sangola (Sholapur District) was selected by Mr. Keatinge and Lieut.-Colonel Walker, but the final selection is to await the development of the Nira Right Bank Canal project. (2) Equines. (i) Horse and Pony stallions. Table X. 33. At the beginning of the year 44 stallions, viz., 19 horses and 25 ponies, were employed at the stud. One pony was sold and none were purchased, leaving 43 at the close of the year. More are being cast. Table XI. 34. During the year 1,272 mares were covered against 1,924 in the previous year. The average number covered per stallion was 30.21 against 46.94. The decrease is due to famine conditions. Table XII. 35. The average annual cost of maintenance of stallions amounted to Rs. 598 per head against Rs. 424 in the previous year. These figures include share of cost of repairs. In addition a sum of Rs. 988 has been expended as the Government share for a new stable at Broach where it is proposed to locate a stallion. (ii) Donkey stallions. 36. There is no mule-breeding in the Presidency. (3) Others. 37. There is nothing to report at present under this head, but the important subject of improvement in sheep breeding will be taken up when funds are available. (4) Fairs and Shows. 38. Owing to the fodder scarcity no horse or cattle shows could be held. It is hoped that village cattle shows in cattle breeding tracts may be revived in the ensuing year. IV.20 41. The veterinary assistants are somewhat uneven in zeal and intelligence, but on the whole they are keen and show progress in their work. The following men are specially commended:21 TABLE II.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT, Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 22nd September 1919. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, on the working of the Veterinary Department in Sind during the year 1918-19. Charge. 2. The charge of the office of Superintendent was held by Mr. J. G. Cattell throughout the year except for the period from the 1st April to the 23rd June 1918, when Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji acted as Superintendent in addition to his own duties as Deputy Superintendent. During that period Mr. Cattell was attached to the Army Remount Department, Baluchistan Circle, from which appointment he proceeded on war leave and subsequently on privilege leave owing to illness. Tour. 3. During the year the Superintendent toured in Sind for 131 days. The Deputy Superintendent is required under the rules to spend at least 6 months in touring systematically throughout the Province. This however was not possible during the year owing to special circumstances, the chief of which was the fact that much time was spent in the special duty of collecting and inspecting cattle for the Military Department for export to Mesopotamia. The Deputy Superintendent's tour of 137 days was not in the Commissioner's opinion unsatisfactory. Mortality statistics. 4. The total reported mortality among cattle from contagious disease was 4,125 against 5,686 in the previous year. The complaint again occurs that tapedars, zamindars and heads of villages who were charged with the duty of reporting outbreaks were lax in doing so. The attention of the district officers has been drawn to the matter and it is hoped that the systematic distribution of service post-cards will lead in time to better reporting by the non-official agencies. An encouraging feature was the readiness of owners of cattle to report outbreaks of diseases to the Veterinary Assistants direct. Inoculation. 5. Preventive inoculations against rinderpest were carried out in the case of 6 outbreaks, the number of animals inoculated being 1,069 against 2,261 animals inoculated in 18 outbreaks during the previous year. Professional work. 6. The number of cases treated at the several dispensaries shows an unsatisfactory decline from 19,213 in the previous year to 17,241, in spite of the fact that one new dispensary was opened during the year. On the other hand the number of animals treated by the Veterinary Assistants on tour rose from 3,334 to 4,664, although their tours were greatly interfered with by the influenza epidemic. Sind scholars at the Bombay Veterinary College. 7. Three candidates passed the final examination in December last; of these, two were holders of scholarships and the third a private student. All three received appointments in the Department. The scholarships for the triennial period commencing from January 1919 were awarded to 3 Mussulmans and one Hindu, all of whom were sons of agriculturists. Dispensaries. 8. One new dispensary was opened at Sukkur in October 1918, bringing the total number in the Province to 15. Owing to the dearth of qualified Veterinary Assistants the proposals for opening five new dispensaries have been held in abeyance. The construction of dispensaries at Kandhkot and Nawabshah is progressing. Breeding operations. 9. The District Local Board Arab stallion "Bahadur" at Larkana covered 43 mares against 53 in the preceding year. This decline is partly accounted for by the presence in the place of another stallion which was kept at Larkana for six months by the Army Remount Department.
32 Willingdon Cattle Farm. 10. The scheme for the establishment of the Willingdon Farm has been retarded by the difficulty of finding a suitable site combining the requisites of abundant pasture land in the vicinity and a good and adequate water supply. Experimental boring operations to test the water supply were commenced in the vicinity of Malir but were brought to a standstill owing chiefly to the want of suitable machinery for pumping water. Sanction, however, has recently been accorded to the purchase of an engine and the necessary plant (vide Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6159, dated 17th July 1919), and experiments will now be continued for the selection of a site answering requirements. Fairs and shows. 11. Cattle shows were held at Mirpurkhas, Larkana and Ghotki. The show at Ghotki was a failure, and the District Local Board have decided to abandon it. Finance. 12. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,27,000 as compared with Rs. 83,000 in the preceding year. The increase was mainly due to the high cost of constructing veterinary buildings and in a minor degree to the grant of war allowance to the subordinate staff. General remarks. 13. The preparation of the Note on the Cattle of Sind was postponed till such time as fodder conditions should improve. Proposals for the separation of the Sind Veterinary charge from that of Baluchistan and Rajputana were referred to Government in January 1918. No orders have yet been issued. Notwithstanding the insufficiency of direction the Department has on the whole done a year's useful work. J. L. RIEU, Acting Commissioner in Sind.

33 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1918-19. Mr. J. G. Cattell held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, from the 24th June 1918 to the end of the year. He was attached to the Army Remount Depart- ment, Baluchistan Circle, from the 1st April to the 5th May 1918 while holding a temporary commission in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers. From the 6th to the 19th May 1918 he was on war leave and from the 20th May to the 23rd June 1918 he was on privilege leave on account of illness. Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, acted as Superintendent in addition to his own duties from the 1st April 1918 until the 23rd June 1918. Mr. Cattell was on tour in Sind for 131 days and travelled 4,610 miles by rail and 454 miles by road. He attended a sectional meeting of Veterinary Officers at Lahore in March 1919. He inspected the veterinary dispensaries at Karachi, Hyderabad, Hala, Mirpurkhas, Jacobabad, Tatta, Sujawal, Nawabshah and Naushahro Feroz. He acted as Veterinary Officer of the Army Remount Department, Baluchistan Circle, until the 4th December 1918 in addition to his own duties. He purchased about 1,100 camels in Sind for the Army. He paid frequent visits to stallion stands and inspected collections of mares. He assisted on the Judging Committees of the horse show held at Jacobabad and the pony and cattle shows held at Ghotki and Mirpurkhas. He visited the Government Agricul- tural Farms at Mirpurkhas and Landhi. He inspected sites for the proposed veterinary dispensaries at Sukkur and Jacobabad. When possible he attended outbreaks of epidemic disease and checked inoculation work carried out by Veterinary Assistants. 2. Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji held the post of Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, throughout the year. He was on tour for 137 days. He travelled 9,153 miles by rail and 521 miles by road. He inspected all the veterinary dispensaries in the province. He checked inocula- tion work and attended outbreaks of disease. He acted as a member of the Judging Committees of the cattle shows held at Ghotki, Mirpurkhas and Larkana. He attended plough and dairy cattle collected at Karachi for export to Mesopotamia and he and the Veterinary Assistant, Karachi, inoculated 4,649 animals with anti-rinderpest serum before shipment. Mr. Haji should have toured more extensively. I.34 8. Other contagious diseases.35 24. Vaccination against hæmorrhagic septicaemia was carried out in one village where this disease was known to recur and 113 animals were treated in this way and no deaths occurred among them. 25. In an outbreak of anthrax in the Thar Parkar district 22 animals were inoculated. Inoculations against anthrax were carried out only when diagnosis of the disease was confirmed microscopically. Four uninocu- lated sheep died during the course of the outbreak and none of the inoculated animals died. Other diseases. Table IV. 26. During the year Veterinary Assistants visited 1,571 villages and treated 2,908 animals for contagious and 1,756 for non-contagious diseases. Fifteen animals were castrated by Veterinary Assistants on tour. In the previous year Veterinary Assistants visited 1,405 villages, treated 1,918 animals for contagious and 1,416 animals for non-contagious diseases and castrated 18 animals. The prevalence of influenza interfered greatly with the touring of Veterinary Assistants. Investigation. 27. During the year the subordinate staff from Sind and Baluchistan submitted a large number of specimens to the Superintendent for examination from suspected cases of surra, anthrax, piroplasmosis, dourine, scab and mange. Veterinary dispensaries. Table V. 28. There were fourteen veterinary dispensaries working in the province at the beginning of the year 1918-19. A new dispen- sary was opened at Sukkur in October 1918. There were thus fifteen veterinary dispensaries working in the province at the close of the year. The total number of patients treated at dispensaries was 17,241 against 19,213 in the previous year. Medicine and advice were given to the owners of 4,823 cases which were not brought to the dispensaries making a total of 22,064 animals treated and supplied with medicine as compared with a total of 22,839 animals treated and supplied with medicine in the previous year. This decrease was due to the prevalence of influenza throughout the province. 29. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining the services of Veterinary Assistants the opening of five dispensaries, which had been approved by District Local Boards, had to be postponed. 30. The construction of dispensaries on the standard plan at Kandkot and Nawabshah has been taken in hand. The funds for this work have been partly provided from the Wadia Trust. A serum pit at the dispensary at Sujawal was completed during the year. III.36 33. Water testing on the site selected for the Willingdon Cattle Farm could not be carried out during the year. Hay which had been cut and stacked in previous years for the farm was sold for Rs. 3,700. There were 24 Karáchi cattle on the Agricultural Department's Farm at Mirpurkhas at the close of the year. During the year four calves were born and two cows died. Milking records of the cows are being kept. (3) Others. 34. There were 4 Tigris ewes, 2 rams and 4 lambs at the beginning of the year on the Agricultural Farm at Mirpurkhas and one lamb was born during the year. Nine sheep died of disease and there were only 2 ewes left at the close of the year. The Tigris sheep have not done well. (4) Fairs and Shows. Table XIV. 35. Three cattle shows were held in the province at Mirpurkhas, Ghotki and Larkana. Mirpurkhas cattle and pony show.37 mainly of grants towards construction of buildings and of war allowances to the subordinate staff. A Government grant of Rs. 800 is included in the expendi- ture on account of part of the cost of maintenance of 4 pony stallions maintained by the District Local Boards of the Larkana and Upper Sind Frontier districts. The stallions are under the control of the Army Remount Department. The figures shown under the head "Provincial" have been supplied by the Account- ant General, while those under the head "Local" have been furnished by the district authorities. VI.39 TABLE II.

No. 2190 of 1920. From G. TAYLOR, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE UNDER SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 26th June 1920. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1919-1920. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. TAYLOR, Superintendent, C.V.D., Bombay Presidency. N 2515 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1919-20. Lieut.-Colonel G. K. Walker was in charge of the Department from the 1st April to the 16th July, and Mr. G. Taylor from the 17th July to the end of the year. The Superintendent was on tour for 153 days (Lieut.-Colonel Walker 28 and Mr. Taylor 125) and travelled 11,636 miles by rail, 935 miles by road and 380 miles by sea. He visited 16 districts, inspected 36 dispensaries and 11 stallion stands once or more. The Northcote Cattle Farm Chharodi was visited twice before it was transferred to the Agricultural Department. The Superintendent conducted the supplementary examination of the Bombay Veterinary College in April and served as a Member of the Board of Examiners in November. He attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture held at Pusa in December. He also served as a Member of the Board of Examiners at the Madras Veterinary College in March. In the course of his tours he visited the seat of several outbreaks of disease and checked inoculation work. 2. Mr. J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year. He was 53 days on tour and travelled 4,266 miles by rail and 574 miles by road. He visited 6 districts and inspected 15 dispensaries and 6 stallion stands. He attended several out- breaks of equine and bovine contagious disease in the course of his tours and dealt with an outbreak of rinderpest in the Deolali Cantonment. The work at headquarters is daily increasing and it is very difficult for him to leave his headquarters and make prolonged tours. I.16 Twelve cases of epizootic lymphangitis were reported from the Remount Depot, Ahmednagar, and from Bombay City. Bovine contagious disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all the districts except Belgaum. The number of deaths recorded was 6,870 against 8,597 last year. This disease was confined chiefly to the Northern and Central Divisions. An extensive outbreak swept the Gujarat districts, Ahmedabad and Kaira suffering severely. The outbreak reached its zenith in September, October and November and gradually subsided in the last month of the year, only 99 deaths were recorded in Kaira, Broach and Surat. In Poona district a severe outbreak was prevalent at the beginning of the year entailing heavy mortality in the hilly tracts of Junnar taluka. Thana, and to a less extent Kolaba district, suffered considerably as usual, and there was a sharp outbreak in the Malegaon taluka of the Nasik district. The Southern districts were comparatively free except for a few sporadic outbreaks. 7. Foot and mouth disease was prevalent as usual in all the districts and accounted for 343 deaths out of 9,285 animals reported to have been attacked. 8. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was reported from 15 districts, Kaira, Kolaba and Belgaum suffering most. The total recorded mortality was 724 against 689 last year. 9. Black-quarter accounted for 214 deaths in six districts of which 146 were reported from Poona district. 10. Anthrax was reported from 12 districts and 283 deaths were reported. 11. Other contagious diseases include variola and infectious lymphangitis in cattle. The latter disease is recorded for the first time in the Presidency and was found to be prevalent to some extent in the Kanara district where 74 animals were attacked and 14 died. The nature of this disease is under investigation by the Imperial Bacterio- logist to whom material was sent for the purpose. Meanwhile cases are being treated by surgical means. Contagious diseases in others animals. 12. No deaths under this head were reported by the revenue officials except 8 cases of sheep-pox. Diseases of sheep and goats are not reported by the revenue officials, but from reports of the staff there seems to be a considerable mortality amongst them from contagious pneumonia. Seventy-six cases of rabies in dogs were dealt with by the Veterinary Staff and 41 brains were sent to the Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination. Spiroch17 15. Out of 189 attended in only 45 outbreaks of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was inoculation performed on 5,449 animals. In one village 315 animals were vaccinated against the disease. During the course of the outbreaks in which inoculation was done 421 uninoculated and 12 inoculated animals died. There were no deaths amongst the vaccinated animals. 16. In four outbreaks 926 animals were inoculated against Anthrax out of which three died. 17. One hundred and one animals were successfully vaccinated for Black-quarter at the Tegur Cattle Farm in Dharwar District. 18. It will be seen from these figures that the operations of the depart- ment in this direction are not limited for want of scope. While occasionally people still object to having their cattle inoculated the chief reason why it is done in so few outbreaks is that the staff are not informed of the outbreak in time to allow the work to be done before the disease has run its course. In such cases the Veterinary Assistant can only give advice to be acted upon on future occasions. The fact that Rs. 510-14-8 were recovered in payment for inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Anthrax shows that the effectiveness of inoculation as a means of protection is appreciated by the people when once they have had experience of it. In this connection until such time as the immediate reporting of disease is enforced by law more active co-operation of the revenue officials in the districts is indicated. The habit of themselves applying for Veterinary aid direct to the Veterinary Assistant, is increasing amongst the people, but, until the staff is considerably increased and the area of their individual jurisdiction greatly reduced, we cannot depend on this alone in order that timely information of the incidence of disease may be obtained. Other diseases. Table IV. 19. The number of villages visited by 65 Veterinary Assistants was 3,085 against 3,307 by 61 Veterinary Assistants last year. During their tours they treated 14,935 cases of conta- gious disease (chiefly Foot and Mouth cases) and 15,736 non-contagious cases. The number of castrations performed was 1,151. Investigation. 20. During the year 403 specimens were sent by the Veterinary Assistants to the Sir D. M. Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination, and five for the College Museum. The outbreak of Infectious Lymphangitis of cattle in Kanara District was investigated by Veterinary Inspector Lopez and the Veterinary Assistant of Sirsi and material for Bacteriological examination was sent to the Imperial Bacteriologist, Muktesar. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 21. Four new dispensaries were opened during the year, viz., at Indi and Sindgi in Bijapur District, at Dakore in Kaira District and at Bandra in Thana District. Including the new dispensaries the number at work at the end of the year was 65 against 61 last year. The number of cases treated was 90,800 against 75,366 last year while medicines were supplied to 59,664 cases against 61,060. The increase in the work is due to the recovery from famine conditions that extended into the early part of the year, the work returning to nearly normal towards the end of the year. 22. The construction of permanent buildings progresses very slowly. The new buildings for one ho pita, viz., at Barsi, was completed during the year. The new hospital buildings at Sirsi, which have been under construction for a considerable time, are not yet completed. N 2518 Funds were provided for the construction of buildings at Baramati and Pandharpur but the work has not yet been taken in hand. There are still 35 hospitals accommodated in temporary buildings of a more or less unsuitable nature. It is a matter for gratification that through the generosity of Messrs. Dwarkadas Tribhovandas and Ranchhod Peraj, the executors of the late Mr. Karsandas Premji of Dakore, in donating a sum of Rs. 10,000 towards the funds of Dakore Veterinary Hospital a suitable building will be provided there. Also Mr. Manekji Dhanjibhai Dhanbhura, who has already contributed largely to the funds of the Bulsar Hospital, very generously gave an additional Rs. 1,136 to enable certain additions to be made. III.19 On the reversion of Mr. Nagarsheth from the post of Manager of Chharodi Cattle Farm he was appointed as a Veterinary Inspector, the appointment being sanctioned in Government Order, Revenue Department, No. 637, dated 24th February 1920. Two Veterinary Assistants died during the year. There are 15 vacancies in the cadre which can only be filled as new dispensaries are opened. All the Veterinary Assistants who were on Military duty have returned. Several Veterinary Assistants were engaged in the early part of the year in the arrange- ments for feeding prickly pear to famine-stricken cattle and their services in this connection were greatly appreciated by the district authorities. 32. Four Veterinary Inspectors were engaged in district work until practically the close of the year. Their duties are very heavy and the excessive size of their charges militates against the effectiveness of their work, much of their time being necessarily spent in travelling in the train when they should be touring in the villages. The relief afforded by the appointment of a fifth Veterinary Inspector is very slight. Veterinary Inspector Marathe was deputed to work for the Bombay Pinjrapole Society in accordance with Government Order, Revenue Department, No. 6832, dated 7th July 1919. While all have worked hard, Veterinary Inspectors Maniar and Nagarsheth deserve special mention for the energy and intelligence with which they have performed their duties. 33. The following Veterinary Assistants are specially commended for their work:20 The Deputy Superintendent Mr. Buxy has worked very hard throughout the year and has been of very great assistance. The clerical staff whose work tends to increase have on the whole worked satisfactorily. G. TAYLOR, Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency.

29 No. 627 of 1920. GENERAL DEPARTMENT (VETERINARY). Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 14th July 1920. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, Baluchistan and Rajputana, on the working of the Veterinary Department in Sind during the year 1919-1920. Charge. 2. Mr. Cattell was in charge of the Department up to the 19th July 1919 when he proceeded on combined leave and was succeeded by Mr. Farbrother who held charge to the end of the year. Mortality statistics. 3. It is satisfactory to note that the total reported mortality from con- tagious disease fell from 4,125 in the previous year to 1,688 in the year under report. The year was undoubtedly more healthy than the previous one: but as the Superintendent points out, reporting of disease is still very poorly done. Inoculation. 4. Preventive inoculations against rinderpest were carried out in the case of three outbreaks, the number of animals inocu- lated being 975 against 1,069 animals inoculated in six outbreaks during the previous year. Professional work. 5. The number of cases treated at the dispensaries shows an increase of 1,286 over the figure of last year. The number of animals treated by the Veterinary Assistants on tour also rose by 64. Dispensaries. 6. No new dispensaries were opened during the year under report owing to the dearth of qualified Veterinary Assistants. Additional dispensaries are much needed and the want of Assistants is a very serious matter. Government have been asked to increase the number of scholarships at the Veterinary College. Sind scholars at the Bombay Veterinary College. 7. Owing to the alteration in the date of the collegiate year from Jan- uary to August no new students were sent to the Veterinary College. Breeding operation. 8. The District Local Board Arab stallion "Bahadur" at Larkana covered 59 mares against 43 in the previous year, and the two District Local Board bulls in the Upper Sind Frontier district covered 63 cows during the year. Willingdon Cattle Farm. 9. The site for the Willingdon Cattle Farm near Karachi has now been finally selected after careful enquiry as to the water available. It is hoped to open it next year and a selected Veterinary Assistant to take up the post of Manager of the farm, has been deputed to the Poona Agricultural College to undergo one year's training in farming and dairying, etc. In the meanwhile a nucleus of the herd is being formed at the Mirpurkhas Agricultural Farm where the cattle are doing very well. Fairs and shows. 10. Only one cattle show was held during the year at Larkana while three were held at Mirpurkhas, Larkana and Ghotki last year. Financial. 11. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,24,500 as compared with Rs. 1,27,200 in the preceding year. General remarks. 12. No orders have as yet been received on the proposals for the separa- tion of the Sind Veterinary charge from that of Baluchistan and Rajputana referred to Government in January 1918. It is desirable in the interests of the work that the enormous area which the Superintendent is at present supposed to supervise should be divided up. N 2530 13. The question of the provision of an isolated ward referred to in paragraph 38 of the report is receiving the Commissioner's attention. 14. The preparation of a note on the Cattle of Sind has been postponed owing to Khán Bahádur Haji being on six months' privilege leave. He has been asked to assign a definite date within which he will complete the work and adhere to it. 15. The Veterinary dispensaries visited by the Commissioner were doing good work. The Department has done as well as was possible in the past year, considering the difficulties alluded to above. P. R. CADELL, Acting Commissioner in Sind, To THE CHIEF SECRETARY GOVERNMERNT, Revenue Department, Bombay.

Rebello, Inspector of the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department continued to act up to 22nd October 1920 as Assistant Professor during the vacancy caused by Mr. Dhakmarvala acting as Assistant Principal. 2. The Students.4 8. There were 16 Government scholarships vacant on 1st August 1920, viz., 14 for youths from the Presidency proper and 2 for youths from Sind. Of the 14 vacancies from the Presidency proper 9 were due to scholars having graduated in December 1919 and 1 to a scholar having qualified in April 1920 and 4 vacancies were due to scholarships having been withdrawn last year. Of the two vacancies for Sind scholars both were due to scholarships being withdrawn on account of scholars having failed to pass the examination in December 1919. 9. The Principal awarded 5 scholarships only as other qualified candidates were not forthcoming at the time of admission. The Commissioner in Sind awarded four schorships this year. There were thus 12 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 7 scholarships awarded in former years), and 8 scholars from Sind (including 4 scholarships awarded in former years.) The Central Provinces Government continued scholarships to 2 students and sent three new scholars. The Gwalior State continued their scholarships to one student and awarded one more.

No. 2557 of 1921. From G. TAYLOR, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 27th June 1921. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the official year 1920-21. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, G. TAYLOR, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. N 915 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERI- NARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1920-21. Mr. G. Taylor was in charge of the Department throughout the year. He was on tour for 149 days and travelled 8,820 miles by rail and 2,143 miles by road. He visited 17 districts, inspected 42 Veterinary dispensaries and 16 stallion stands once or more. He conducted the supplementary examination of the Bombay Veterinary College in April, and served as the President of the Board of Examiners in December 1920. In the course of his tours he visited the seats of several outbreaks of contagious disease and checked inoculation work of the staff. He also inspected at various times the following famine cattle camps :16 The Veterinary Assistants attended 1,871 outbreaks of which 318 were also attended by the Veterinary Inspectors. The number of outbreaks reported to the staff by the revenue officials was 1,550. The remaining 321 had been brought to the notice of the Veterinary Assistants by private individuals. Equine contagious disease. 5. Eleven cases of glanders were reported from Bombay City. Surra was reported from six districts and from Bombay City. There were 102 deaths against 154 in the last year. The disease was severe in the Thana and Kaira Districts, but the mortality shows a decrease in the Kolaba District compared with last year. As usual this disease was in nearly all cases brought to light by the staff on their periodic inspections of Tonga lines. Bovine contagious disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all the districts of the Presidency. The number of deaths recorded was 5,910 against 6,870 last year. These figures cannot be relied on as showing that the year has been a comparatively healthy one so far as rinderpest is concerned. The facts are the reverse and the disease has been particularly widespread. Last year there were only 452 outbreaks of rinderpest reported while this year the number was 793. The mortality from rinderpest as shown by the figures of the epizootic disease reports submitted by the staff when they investigate an outbreak is 9,479 which is nearly double that of the village officers' reports on which we depend for our statistics, notwithstanding the fact that the former are usualy based on a single visit whereas the latter are supposed to be weekly returns of the mortality throughout the duration of the outbreak. With a view to obtaining some information that would give a more or less accurate idea of the losses from this disease special investigations were carried out by Khan Saheb Buxy in Surat District and Veterinary Inspector Nagarsheth in Nasik District. In Surat district the investigation extended to 63 villages in many of which the enquiries were made by Khan Saheb Buxy personally. In these 63 villages 668 animals were known to have died from rinderpest which Khan Saheb Buxy values at Rs. 71,300, roughly Rs. 106 per head, which is a very low valuation of the cattle in Surat. In Olpad Taluka special facilities for enquiry were afforded in 4 villages in which the total number of cattle was 1,000 head; of these 180 died all valuable animals worth about Rs. 25,000. In Nasik district the enquiry extended to 67 villages in Satana, Chandor, Kalwan and Malegaon Talukas. The total number of deaths was 989, which, at Rs. 45 per head, gives a loss to these Talukas of Rs. 44,505. These are facts as accurate as they can be ascertained at present but further speculation based on the present available data as to the total loss inflicted in the whole Presidency by contagious disease would be misleading. Regarding the distribution of Rinderpest, Kolaba was the most seriously affected of the districts. The whole of the northern and central divisions were severely affected however, the districts suffering most being those into, and through which, famine stricken cattle were moved. Thus Nasik and West-Khandesh suffered very severely and also Panch-Mahals. The southern division was comparatively free from the disease. 7. Foot and mouth disease was prevalent in all the districts, and accounted for 256 deaths out of 16,158 animals reported to have been attacked. 8. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was reported from 15 districts, of which Surat and Dharwar suffered the most. The total mortality recorded was 545 against 724 last year. 9. Black-quarter was reported from 5 districts and accounted for 80 deaths of which 50 deaths were reported from Ahmednagar. 10. Anthrax was reported from 7 districts and caused 404 deaths; Thana district reporting 202 deaths.
17 Contagious diseases in other animals. 11. As usual no reports from revenue officers were received, but an outbreak of Anthrax in sheep from Ahmedadad was brought to light by the staff; this outbreak of Anthrax was reported to the Secretary of the Wool Association, Bombay. Pleuro-pneumonia in Sheep and Goats was also reported from Broach District. Spiroch18 At the request of Major Patton, I.M.S., the Director of the Pasteur Institute, Coonoor, a large number of specimens of maggots from cases of cutaneous myiasis were sent to him by the staff. In acknowledging the material Major Patton states that in all cases the condition had been caused by a single blue bottle fly which proves to be a new species of which a description will be published by him in the Imperial Journal of Medical Research. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 20. Eight new dispensaries were opened during the year, viz., at Italva in Surat district, Satana in Nasik district, Talegaon in Poona district, Kopergaon in Ahmednagar district, Songola in Sholapur district, Ron and Haveri in Dharwar district and Kumta in Kanara district. Including the new dipensaries the number at work at the end of the year was 73, against 65 last year. The number of cases treated was 89,522 against 90,800 last year, while medicines were supplied to 46,068 cases against 59,664. The slight decrease in the number of patients is fairly well distributed throughout and may be ascribed to cutaneous myiasis being less prevalent than usual, and, in some cases, to famine conditions. 21. As stated in the last year's report the work of construction of permanent buildings progresses very slowly. A Dispensary and Store room and a cattle shed were completed at Haliyal during the year through the generosity of Rao Bahadur Gopal Giri. The new hospital buildings at Sirsi still remain to be completed but arrangements have been come to whereby it is hoped they will be completed in the current year. Funds were provided for the construction of buildings at Pandharpur and Baramati. The Pandharpar hospital is nearing completion but the work has not yet been taken in hand at Baramati. There are many hospitals located in temporary buildings of an unsuitable nature in which the work cannot be carried on with much convenience. The following 5 new dispensaries were opened during the year by the help of popular contributions, viz., (1) Italva, (2) Satana, (3) Haveri, (4) Ron, and (5) Kumta-. It is very satisfactory that the demand for these institutions should be given expression to in such a usuful manner. Without these subscriptions it is very doubtful if the hospitals would have been opened. In only one case, that of Malwan, has the amount of work at a hospital been unsatisfactory and the question of shifting the hospital to a more suitable centre is under consideration. By way of experiment the dispensary of Sirur Taluka of Poona District was conducted on itinerating lines but owing to the prevalence of famine conditions the results were not such as would indicate success or failure of such a system. III.19 Table XI. 25. During the year 1,491 mares were covered against 1,336 in the previous year. The average per stallion was 39.47 against 36.43 last year which shows a satisfactory improvement considering the season. Table XII. 26. The average annual cost of maintenance of the stallions amounted to Rs. 772 per head against Rs. 726 last year. The increase is partly due to the higher wages that are being paid to syces and partly to a general increase in the cost of grain and fodder. Owing to fodder scarcity it was difficult to make satisfctory arrangements for grass, etc., no contractors being prepared to undertake the supply at reasonable rates. I am indebted to Mr. Thomson, Controller of Civil Supplies, for his assistance in supplying grass. (ii) Donkey stallions. 27. There is no mule-breeding carried on in the Presidency. (3) Others. 28. There is nothing to report under this head. (4) Fairs and Shows. 29. Owing to prevalence of famine conditions no horse shows were held this year. IV.20 Khan Saheb Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, has as usual worked with zeal and energy and has been of great assistance to me. While he was on leave the duties of Personal Assistant were efficiently carried out by Veterinary Inspector Maniar. The clerical staff have also worked very satisfactorily throughout the year. G.

29 No. 646 of 1921. GENERAL DEPARTMENT (VETERINARY); Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 30th June 1921. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, on the working of the Veterinary Department during the year 1920-21. Charge. 2. Mr. Farbrother was in charge of the Department up to the 3rd February 1921, when he proceeded on combined leave. Khan Bahadur Haji held charge from the 4th February to the 28th March 1921, when the veterinary charge of Sind was separated from that of Baluchistan and Rajputana, and placed in charge of Mr. Jerrom from the 29th March 1921. As no officer has been appointed to hold veterinary charge of Baluchistan and Rajputana, this charge is held by the Sind Superintendent in addition to his regular duties. Mortality Statistics. 3. The year has been an unhealthy one for cattle and much disease prevailed. The total reported mortality from con- tagious disease rose from 1,688 in the previous year to 10,564 during the year under report. It is not improbable that the actual mortality was even heavier. The increase is chiefly due to very severe outbreaks of rinderpest. Contagious pleuro-pneumonia and anthrax were also responsible to some extent. The complaint again occurs that outbreaks of epidemic disease are not promptly reported by the tapadars and zamindars. The attention of the district officers is being drawn to this. The Commissioner has under con- sideration a scheme for the more efficient registration of human vital statistics, and he will consider the advisability of entrusting the work of reporting cattle epidemics to the same agency. Inoculation. 4. It is satisfactory to note that the number of inoculations against rinder- pest rose from 975 in the previous year to 20,473 during the year under report. They are reported to have done much towards checking the mortality resulting from a widespread epidemic. Eleven camels and 251 cattle were inoculated during the year with anthrax and hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum respectively. Inoculation work was vigorously carried on, especially in the Upper Sind Frontier district. Dispensaries. 5. No new dispensaries were opened during the year under report. To meet the demand for additional Veterinary Assist- ants, Government, in their Order No. 1734, dated 11th June 1920, sanctioned the deputation of two additional students during the year 1920, and also increased temporarily the rate of the scholarship to meet the high cost of living. Professional work. 6. The aggregate number of cases treated at the several dispensaries rose from 18,527 in the previous year to 19,170 during the year under report, and the number of animals treated on tour rose from 4,728 to 5,678. The increase is inconsiderable, but no great development in this respect can be expected until the staff of the department is sufficiently strengthened to admit of extensive operations throughout the mofussil. Veterinary instruction. 7. There were seven stipendiary students studying at the Bombay Vete- rinary College. Of these four appeared for the 2nd and three for the 1st Professional Examinations. All the students passed and were promoted to higher classes. Breeding operations. 8. The District Local Board Arab stallion standing at Larkana covered 67 mares against 59 during the previous year, and 2 District Local Board bulls in the Upper Sind Frontier district covered 112 cows against 63 last year. N 930 Willingdon Cattle Farm. 9. The question of the selection of a site for the Willingdon Cattle Farm near Karachi has now been decided, and the work of the farm will be started in kacha huts for the present. A Veterinary Assistant specially trained for the purpose will remain in charge of the Farm. Financial. 10. The total expenditure of the department during the year amounted to Rs. 1,23,090, as compared with Rs.1,24,500 in the preceding year. General remarks. 11. Orders for the separation of the Sind Veterinary charge from that of Baluchistan and Rajputana and the placing of the former under a full-time Superintendent have been received, but orders on the remaining reorganization proposals are still awaited. The question of the provision of an isolated ward is still under correspondence with the Municipality. 12. The department has done a good year's work, but there is no doubt that there is scope for very much greater activity. Until the separation of the Sind charge is more than a mere arrangement on paper and until a staff of Veterinary Inspectors is appointed for Sind to assist the Superintendent and the Deputy Superintendent, the department will continue to labour under a heavy handicap.

No. 3772 of 1922. From E. S. FARBROTHER, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.C.V.D., Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 28th June 1922. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1921-22. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency Q 415 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1921-22. Mr. G. Taylor was in charge of the Department from 1st April to 30th June 1921, when he proceeded on leave and Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, was acting until relieved by Mr. E. S. Farbrother on the 9th February 1922. Mr. Taylor was on tour for 46 days and travelled 1,423 miles by rail and 508 miles by road. He visited 5 districts, inspected 13 Veterinary dispensaries and one stallion stand. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy as acting Superintendent was on tour for 87 days and travelled 6,475 miles by rail and 233 miles by road. He visited 8 districts, inspected 15 Veterinary dispensaries and 6 stallion stands. Mr. Farbrother was on tour for 2 days and travelled 238 miles by rail. Khan Saheb Buxy conducted the supplementary examination of the Bombay Veterinary College in December 1921. He attended as a Member of the Provincial Agricultural and Co-operative Conference held in Poona in August 1921 and presided at a divisional Veterinary Conference held at Belgaum in January 1922. He has also been appointed by Government a Member of the Cattle Breeding Committee. In the course of their tours the Superintendents visited the seats of several outbreaks of contagious diseases and checked inoculation work of the staff. Touring to the usual extent could not be done during the year owing to an outbreak of Glanders in Poona from July to November 1921 when the Superintendent had to remain a good deal at headquarters to supervise the measures taken to deal with the outbreak. 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent from 1st April to 30th June 1921 and again from 9th February to the end of the year. During the remaining period of 6 months and 9 days from 1st August to 9th February Mr. P. D. Maniar, Vaterinary Inspector, Ahmedabad Division, acted for him. The post was vacant during the month of July. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy as Deputy Superintendent was 24 days on tour and travelled 2,183 miles by rail and 172 miles by road. Mr. Maniar was 28 days on tour and travelled 3,454 miles by rail and 179 miles by road. I.16 proposals for furnishing statistical information have been newly introduced which tend to secure more accuracy and promptitude. During the year 2,243 outbreaks were attended by Veterinary Assistants and 259 by Veterinary Inspectors as against 1,871 and 318 outbreaks respectively last year. Equine contagious disease. 5. Seventy cases of glanders were reported of which 56 occurred in Bombay City and 16 in Poona. Included in the latter figure are two cases which showed all the symptoms of glanders, but which died before the Mallein test could be carried out. This was the first appearance of the disease in Poona. Surra was the cause of 102 deaths, against the same number in the previous year. Bombay City, Thana and West Khandesh were chiefly affected. Other diseases include 4 cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis of which 3 were reported from Bombay and one from Poona, and one case of strangles from Ahmednagar. Bovine contagious disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all the districts except Belgaum and Bijapur. Deaths from this disease amounted to 10,593 against 5,910 in the previous year. This disease again showed a tendency to confine itself to the Northern and Central divisions, Thana, Poona and Kolaba districts were the most heavily infected, these three districts alone being responsible for more than half the total mortality. 7. Foot and mouth disease was prevalent in all the districts except Panch Mahals and accounted for 233 deaths out of 59,686 animals reported to have been attacked. This is the first time that this disease has been so wide spread in the Presidency. In the Dharwar division alone 27,624 animals were affected and the staff deserve great credit for the manner in which they combatted the disease. It is interesting to note that in spite of the wide spread infection the percentage of deaths was only 0.3 as compared with 1.6 in the previous year. 8. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was reported from all the districts except East Khandesh and Bombay City. The total mortality recorded was 2,469 against 545 last year. 9. Black-quarter was reported from 4 districts and accounted for 222 deaths as compared with 80 last year. As usual the greatest number of deaths was reported from the Ahmednagar District. 10. Anthrax was reported from 14 districts and accounted for 1,096 deaths against 404 last year. It was specially virulent in the coastal districts. Of the 148 outbreaks attended, only 18 were confirmed. Contagious diseases in other animals. 11. One outbreak of Anthrax in sheep and goats was reported from Ahmednagar district. Pleuro-pneumonia in sheep and goats was reported from Ahmedabad district and further investigation in this direction will be taken up soon. Foot and mouth disease in sheep and goats was reported from Bijapur, Kanara and Kolaba districts. Parasitic diseases in sheep and goats have also been reported. Variola in sheep and goats was reported from 3 districts. Fifty-eight cases of rabies in dogs were dealt with by the Veterinary staff as against 48 cases last year and 24 brains were sent to the Bacteriological Laboratories for examination.
17 Preventive measures. Table III. 12. The number of cattle inoculated against Rinderpest amounted to 32,900. These inoculations were carried out in only 307 outbreaks of the 699 attended by the staff. In the outbreaks in which inoculation was performed 4,303 uninoculated animals and 191 inoculated animals died. One hundred and eighty-seven animals in the Chharodi Government Farm, Ahmedabad, were protected from Rinderpest by the Serum Simultaneous Method. 13. Of the 291 outbreaks of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia attended by the staff inoculation was carried out in 65 outbreaks on 4,922 animals. Vaccination against this disease was carried out in 4 villages on 739 animals. During the course of the outbreaks in which inoculation was performed 615 uninoculated and 4 inoculated animals died. There were no deaths amongst vaccinated animals. 14. In 16 outbreaks 754 animals were protected against Anthrax. Eighty-five from the uninoculated and 5 from the inoculated animals died. 15. Forty-seven animals were successfully protected by vaccination against Black-quarter at the Tegur Government Agricultural Farm. Dharwar district. 16. This year Rs. 554-7-0 were recovered as fees for inoculation against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Anthrax and vaccination against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia as against Rs. 769-3-8 last year. 17. The work of inoculation has not been so extensive as last year, the number of inoculations being only just over half the number carried out in 1920-21. This may be attributed to the fact of the agriculturists being ill advised by certain malicious persons. Other diseases. Table IV. 18. The number of villages visited by 80 Veterinary Assistants was 4,319, against 4,460 by 73 Veterinary Assistants last year. During their tours they treated 36,973 cases of contagious diseases (chiefly Foot and mouth disease and Rinderpest) and 10,616 non-contagious cases. The number of castrations performed on tour was 621. The reduction in the number of villages visited is due to the restriction of all touring, the Veterinary Assistants only visiting villages in which epizootic diseases were reported. Investigation. 19. During the year 461 specimens were sent by the Veterinary Assist- ants to the Sir D. M. Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination and 9 for the College Museum. During the latter part of the year Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy carried out some investigations to determine the extent of parasitic infection and the mortality from this cause among the cattle of the Presidency, but sufficient data has not yet been collected to allow a definite opinion being formed. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 20. Seven new dispensaries were opened during the year, viz., at Borsad in Kaira district, Shahada in West Khandesh. district, Bhusawal and Pachora in East Khandesh district, Wai in Satara district, Pen in Kolaba district, and Gokak in Belgaum district. Including the new dispensaries the number at work at the end of the year was 80 against 73 last year. The number of cases treated was 104,324 against 89,522 last year, while medicines were supplied to 61,675 cases against 46,068 last year. The large increase in the number of patients is observed Q 4 18 throughout and is ascribed to the prevalence of &quot; Foot and Mouth &quot; and other contagious diseases to an enormous extent and also to the increasing popularity of these institutions. 21. The work of construction of permanent buildings progresses very slowly. A dispensary and in-patient shed at Sakri were built with the help of funds collected by the people, and the District Local Board, Kolaba, has con- structed the dispensary at Alibag. The buildings at Baramati have been taken in hand during the year and are nearing completion. Funds have been provided by the District Local Board to complete the buildings at Sirsi. The question of removing the Malwan Veterinary Dispensary to a more suitable centre, which was under consideration last year, has yet to be decided. The Veterinary dispensary at Sirur Taluka, Poona District, which was conducted on itinerating lines was subsequently made stationary with its headquarters at Talegaon Dhamdhere. III.19 V.20 TABLE II.

29 No. V-45. GENERAL DEPARTMENT (VETERINARY). Office of the Commissioner in Sind : Government House, Karachi, 27th June 1922. MEMORANDUM. The Commissioner in Sind has the honour to submit the report of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, on the working of the Veterinary Department during the year 1921-22. Charges. 2. The charge of the office of Superintendent was held by Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom throughout the year under report, in addition to the Veterinary charge of Baluchistan. Mortality Statistics. 3. The total reported mortality among cattle from contagious disease increased from 10,564 in the previous year to 13,798 in the year under report, a fact principally due to the still further spread of rinderpest, which was already very prevalent in the preceding year. This disease accounted for 86 per cent. of the total reported mortality. Inoculation. 4. Preventive inoculations against rinderpest were carried out in the case of 201 outbreaks, the number of animals inoculated being 15,514 against 20,473 in the previous year. The report does not account for the decline in the number of inoculations in a year when disease was more prevalent than before. The number of inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was 825. The mortality from this disease was 98. No death occurred amongst inoculated animals. Dispensaries. 5. A new dispensary was opened at Umarkot in June 1921, bringing the total number in the Province to 16. Professional work. 6. The aggregate number of cases treated at the several dispensaries rose from 19,170 in the previous year to 19,489 during the year under report, while the number of animals treated on tour declined from 5,678 in the previous year to 4,741 in the year under report. Veterinary instruction. 7. There were seven stipendiary students studying at the Bombay Veterinary College during the year under report. Breeding operations. 8. There were three District Local Board stallions under the Civil Veterinary Department at the close of the year. These covered 76 mares during the year, the aggregate cost of their maintenance being Rs. 1,946. Two District Local Board bulls covered 103 cows as against 112 last year. Govern- ment contributed the entire cost (Rs. 1,300) of the stallion purchased by the Nawabshah District Local Board and half the cost (Rs. 650) of that purchased by the Thar Parkar District Local Board. After the close of the year the Civil Veterinary Department took over control of the horse breeding operations previously in charge of the Army Remount Department, the latter department having closed down its operations in Sind. This involved the taking over of 9 stallions belonging to the District Local Boards. Willingdon Cattle Farm. 9. The Willingdon Cattle Farm was started on land in the vicinity of Malir on the 10th July 1921. The total expenditure of the farm excluding the pay of the Manager. was Rs. 20,000. There were 43 head of cattle at the farm at the close of the year, 37 animals previously maintained at Mirpurkhas having been brought over to the new farm. Financial. 10. The total expenditure of the department during the year amounted to Rs. 1,86,643 as against Rs. 1,23,090 last year. Q 430 General remarks. 11. The Baluchistan Veterinary charge has as yet not been taken over by a full time officer, nor has a separate clerical establishment for Baluchistan been sanctioned. 12. The creation of the three posts of Inspectors which has been held over (vide paragraph 2 of Government Order, Revenue Department, No. 1884, dated the 5th July 1921) is an immediate necessity as the Deputy Superin- téndent is due to retire in April next. Without these appointments the super- vision of the work of Veterinary Assistants both at dispensaries and in the districts cannot be efficiently carried out. 13. The question of the preparation of a monograph on the cattle breeds in Sind has been referred to Government, with the recommendation that the work should be entrusted to an officer who would be appointed cattle-breeding expert for Sind. The Commissioner considers that this appointment is urgently required for the conservation and development of the Karachi breed of cattle, one of the finest breeds of milch cattle in the world and an asset of incalculable value to the country. The establishment of the Willingdon Cattle Farm is a step in the right direction so far as this is concerned, but its utility is likely to be greatly restricted by the inadequacy of the funds supplied for the prosecution of its operations. A satisfactory feature of the year's administration has been the placing of the remuneration of Veterinary Assistants on a proper basis. J. L. RIEU, Commissioner in Sind.

33 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1921-1922. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.C.V.D., held charge of the office of Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, throughout the year under report, in addition to the Veterinary Charge of Baluchistan. He inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries in Sind with the exception of Sujawal and when possible attended outbreaks of epidemic disease. He visited the Willingdon Cattle Farm on several occasions. He attended the Jacobabad Horse Show and the Cattle show held at Mehar in the Larkana District and inspected several sites for the Hyderabad Veterinary Dispensary. He was on tour in Sind for 70 days and travelled 3,480 miles by rail and 878 miles by road. He was deputed to attend the Surra Conference at Simla in which connection he spent 8 days and travelled 1,986 miles by rail. 2. Khan Babadur S. G. Haji held the post of Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, throughout the year. He was on tour for 123 days and travelled 4,017 miles by rail and 1,240 miles by road. He visited the Willingdon Cattle Farm continually and supervised its working. Owing to this he was unable to do his ordinary touring. Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji has been allowed an extension of service up to 31st March 1923. I.34 Contagious Disease among other animals. 15. Rabies.35 (2) Bovines. Table VIII. 27. There are 2 District Local Board bulls in the Upper Sind Frontier District. They covered 103 cows against 112 last year. 28. Deh Phihai and Sharabi site of the Willingdon Cattle Farm was finally decided upon, and the farm was started on 10th July 1921. 284,252 lbs. of hay was cut and stacked at a cost of Rs. 2,474. The total expenditure of the farm excluding the pay of the Manager which is debited to the Subordinate Civil Veterinary Department, was Rs. 20,000. There were 37 head of cattle on 1st April 1921 at the Willingdon Cattle Farm. During the year 2 bull-calves and one heifer were born and 1 cow, 1 heifer and 2 working bullocks were purchased and 1 bull was loaned to a local zemindar. There were thus 43 head of cattle at the close of the year. (3) Other Animals. 29. There are two Tigris ewes, the same number as last year. (4) Fairs and Shows. Table XIV. 30. Only one Cattle Show was held in Sind during the year at Mehar. 239 animals were exibited and Rs. 330 and two silver medals were awarded in prizes from Provincial and Local Funds as against 133 animals exhibited and Rs. 330 and 2 silver medals awarded last year. IV.36 PROGRAMME OF WORK OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1922-23. General routine work will be carried out and the existing Veterinary Dis- pensaries will continue. It is proposed to open one more dispensary in the province but for want of Veterinary Assistants and owing to financial strin- gency, no programme for further expansion of the department can be contem- plated. Proposals for improvement in the expansion of the Willingdon Cattle Farm have been submitted to Government but as they entail considerable expenditure it is not certain that the proposals will be sanctioned. 2. Horse breeding operations in Sind have been entrusted to this Depart- ment as an experimental measure for three years, but, owing to financial reasons no improvement can be expected for some time. 3. With a view to exercising economy, touring has been reduced as much as possible. J. H. G. JERROM, I.C.V.D., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana.
