OFFICE OF SANITARY COMMISSIONER, Madras, June 23rd, 1868. From W. MACKENZIE, Esq., C.B., C.S.I., President, Colonel A. C. SILVER,                    } Cholera Committee ; Surgeon-Major J. L. RANKING, }Members. To The Honorable R. S. ELLIS, C.B., Chief Secretary to Government, Fort Saint George. Subject of Report. SIR,-In compliance with the instructions of Government as conveyed in their Order No. 216, dated the 27th February 1867, the subject of the arrangements which should be made for giving practical effect in this Presidency to the recommen- dations and suggestions of the International Sanitary Conference, has received our careful attention, and we have the honor to submit the following observations thereon. Result of enquiries. 2. We may premise that the result of our enquiries leads us to believe that it is possible, by the enforcement of such regulations as we propose, in some instances to prevent the origination, and in others to check the dissemination, of epidemics of Cholera similar to those which have, in past years, been such a fruitful source of the loss of life among Civil and Military communities. Cause of delay. 3.    The very extended field of enquiry which presented itself to us will, we trust, sufficiently excuse the unavoidable delay which has occurred in the submission of the following remarks. 4.    Before entering upon any considerations of the many circumstances under which epidemic cholera is originated and caused to spread in India, we consider it advisable to submit briefly to Government the various questions investigated by the Constantinople International Sanitary Commission, as the conclusions arrived at are the bases upon which our several recommendations are founded. Dr. Leith's Abstract 5. The catechetical abstract of the labors of the Cholera Commission given below is copied almost verbatim from an abstract of their proceedings and reports, compiled by Dr. A. H. Leith, then President of the Sanitary Commission, Bombay. We gladly avail ourselves of the opportunity of recording our high sense of the value of his work, in which is contained, in a small compass, all the most valuable conclusions arrived at by the Conference, with the principal arguments and statements of facts upon which  those conclusions are based.
2 -should be reprinted. 6. Indeed, so much that is valuable is contained in this abstract, that we would respectfully urge on the Government that the whole volume might, with advantage, be reprinted in the Govern- ment Printing Press for general distribution. Arrangement of topics con- sidered by the "Conference." 7. The " Conference" divided the subjects of their enquiry into three groups. 1st.-The origin and generation of Cholera, the " endemicity" and the " epidemicity" of the disease in India. 2nd.-The transmissibility and the propagation of cholera. 3rd.-The prevention of Cholera. Under this last group, the Conference have presented not only a report on the sanitary measures to be taken for the prevention of Cholera; but reports on quaran- tine measures, on sanitary cordons and on Lazarets; rules for quarantine and dis- infection; bills of health; measures to be taken in the East are also considered, as are the measures to be taken in India, and between India and Europe, against the importa- tion of the disease by sea, and finally the measures to be taken against its importation by land. Scope of this Report. 8. In the remarks we are about to submit to the Government, we have confined ourselves to such portions only of the reports of the Conference as appear to us of importance in their direct appli- cation to this Presidency, either in respect to observations derived from local experience, confirmatory of conclusions arrived at by the Conference, or subjects upon which it is desirable that information, not available to the Conference, should hereafter be obtained from this part of India. The enforcement of the re- commendations of the Con- ference requires the authority of Government. 9. There are many recommendations made by the Conference, which are peculiarly applicable to this Presidency, and upon which, in our opinion, it is desirable that action should be taken by the Government, either by means of legislative enactments, or by orders in the Civil or Military Departments of the Administration. 10. The following are the questions considered and the conclusions arrived at, regarding the chief points which indicate the necessity of laying down certain rules for the prevention of this disease. "Question 1st.-Whence comes Asiatic Cholera ? Is it indigenous ? In what countries is it now endemic ? "Answer.-The Asiatic Cholera, which has several times spread over the world, is indigenous in India, where it had its birth, and where it exists permanently as an endemic. " Question 2nd.-Is Asiatic Cholera endemic anywhere out of India ? " Answer.-Asiatic Cholera is never developed spontaneously, and has never been found to be endemic in the countries of Europe, the Caucasian provinces, Turkey in Asia, all the North of Africa, and the two Americas, into which it has come from without. As to the countries in the neighbourhood of India, while admitting  the pro-
3 bability, that Cholera does not exist in them as an endemic, it cannot be formally concluded that it does not. " Question 3rd.-Is there not reason to fear that Cholera may become natura- lized in our (European, &c.) countries ? " Answer.-It appears likely that by repeated invasions, the principle of the disease may in some manner be naturalized. " Question 4th.-Is there in the Hijaz an original source of Cholera, either permanent or periodic ? " Answer.-Asiatic Cholera does not appear to have an original source in the Hijaz, but it appears to have been hitherto always imported there. " Question 5th.-Are there certain localities in India where alone Cholera is engendered, or which are particularly favorable to its development? In other words, is Cholera endemic in all parts of India, or only in certain districts, which it is possible to circumscribe ? " Answer.-There are in India certain localities, chiefly in the valley of the Ganges, where Cholera is endemic, without its being possible to particularize all, or to affirm that they exclusively give birth to the disease. " Question 6th.-Do we know the concurrence of causes under which Cholera has its spontaneous birth in India ; also the circumstances which make it take an epidemic form ? " Answer.-We do not know the special conditions under which Cholera has its birth in India and reigns there endemically in certain localities. " Question 7th.-What are the circumstances that conduce to the develop- ment and propagation of epidemics of cholera in India ? " Answer.-Pilgrimages are in India the most powerful of all the causes which conduce to the development and to the propagation of epidemics of cholera. " Question 8th.-Is the transmissibility of cholera now proved by facts that admit of no other interpretation ? "Answer.-All the facts hitherto ascertained demonstrate that Cholera is propagated by man and with a speed proportioned to the amount and rapidity of his emigrations. The transmissibility of Asiatic Cholera is incontestable, and is proved by facts that admit of no other interpretation. "Question 9th.-Are there any conclusive facts that constrain us to admit that cholera can be spread to a distance by certain conditions of the atmosphere, by winds, or any other change or modification of the air ? "Answer.-Hitherto no fact has proved that cholera can spread to a dis- tance by the atmosphere alone, whatever may be its condition. "Question 10th.-How is cholera imported, and what are the agents in its transmission ? "Answer.-From all that has been learnt, there are two things necessary to the outbreak and the spread of Asiatic Cholera in a locality-an arrival from an infected place and circumstances that favor the transmission. As regards the former, an  arri-
4 val with cholera is a complex affair ; it includes man and his clothing, personal effects, merchandise, animals, the ship which carries him, and, in short, all that accompanies the man. Is all that constitutes an arrival equally capable of transmitting the disease ? It was a long while believed that the lapse of a few days between the depar- ture and arrival without appearance of cholera was a sufficient guarantee against the importation of the disease. But well attested facts show that even a long voyage, without appreciable accidents, does not ensure against danger. On the other hand, it is certain that the regular packet boats, that for many years have plied with India, have never imported cholera into Suez. Without at present entering into particulars, it may be concluded that, even if every arrival from a country affected with cholera be not capable of propagating the disease, it is not the less prudent, pending fuller information, to consider every arrival as suspicious. "Question 11th.-What are the conditions in which man imports cholera ? "Answer.-There is no doubt as to man being the principal agent in the importation of the disease. The arrival of a great number suffering with cholera is not necessary for the causing of a great epidemic. A few sick, or even a single case, may suffice. There is no proportion between the amount of cholera imported and the intensity of the ensuing epidemic. The intensity is influenced by the more or the less favorable conditions of the locality, as a conflagration is not in proportion to the spark that kindles it, but to the inflammability and the quantity of material that it meets with. One person with cholera may occasion an epidemic. " Question 12th.-Can an individual with only Choleraic Diarrha, commu- nicate Cholera ? " Answer.-A person coming from a source of Cholera, and although suffer- ing only with Diarrha, may import the disease. " Question 13th.-What is the length of the time of incubation ? "Answer.-In nearly all cases the period of incubation, that is the time lapsed between the moment when a person can have contracted the choleraic poisoning and the beginning of the premonitory Diarrha, or confirmed Cholera, does not exceed a few days ; all the cited facts of a longer incubation are referable to cases which are not con- clusive, either because the premonitory Diarrha has been included in the period of incubation, or because the infection may have occurred after leaving the infected place. "Question 14th.-Can Cholera be imported and communicated by living animals ? " Answer.-There is no known fact that proves that Cholera may be import- ed by living animals; but it is reasonable to consider them in certain cases as suscep- tible articles. " Question 15th.-Can Cholera be imported and transmitted by linen cloth- ing, and generally by things in personal use ? " Answer.-Cholera can be transmitted by articles of personal property com- ing from an infected place, and especially by those which have been used by sufferers under Cholera; and certain facts prove that the disease may be carried to a distance by such articles, shut up from the access of fresh air.
5 " Question 16th.-Can Cholera be imported and transmitted by merchandise? " Answer.-Until fuller information be obtained, it will be prudent to consi- der as suspicious, unless in particular and defined conditions, every arrival from a centre of Cholera. "Question 17th.-Can the bodies of those who have died of Cholera be the means of importing and transmitting the disease ? "Answer.-Although it is not proved by convincing facts, that Cholera can be transmitted by means of such corpses, it is prudent to consider them to be dangerous. " Question 18th.-What influence have the different modes of communication, by land or by sea, on the propagation of Cholera ? "Answer.-Communications by sea are from their nature the most dangerous; it is they that most certainly spread Cholera; and then come communications by Rail- ways, as they in a very short time, can carry the disease to a great distance. "Question 19th.-What is the influence of deserts on the propagation of Cholera ? " Answer.-Great deserts are a very effectual barrier to the propagation of Cholera. There is no instance of that disease being imported into Egypt or Syria by caravans coming from Mecca. "Question 20th.-What is the influence of assemblages or congregations (ag- glomerations) of men on the intensity of epidemics of cholera; also on the propaga- tion of the disease ? and under what conditions does that influence operate ? "Answer.-Every assemblage of men, in which Cholera appears, is a condition favorable to the rapid extension of the disease, and, if the assemblage is in a bad sani- tary condition, to the violence of the epidemic. In like circumstances the rapidity of the extension is in proportion to the concentration of the congregated mass, while the violence of the epidemic (all other things being equal) is the greater the less the indi- viduals have already been under a choleraic influence, or if they remain uncontaminat- ed by it; that is to say in other words, those who have already been under the influ- ence of a source of cholera have a kind of relative and temporary immunity that coun- terbalances the grievous effects of the agglomeration. Lastly, in a congregated mass the more rapidly the epidemic spreads the more quickly also does it cease ; unless new healthy arrivals furnish fresh aliment to the disease, and so sustain it. " Question 21st.-What intensity and persistence have epidemics of cholera in ships ? " Answer.-The intensity of epidemics of Cholera on board ships, crowded with men, is usually in proportion to the crowding, and is more violent when those on board do not come from a residence in a centre of Cholera ; in crowded ships the progress of epidemics is generally rapid; lastly, the danger of importation by ships and of giving rise to a severe epidemic, are not altogether dependent on the intensity, or even the occurrence, of choleraic casualties that have happened during the voyage. " Question 22nd.-What influence have assemblages in lazarets, of persons coming from a source of Cholera, on the development of the disease among those in quarantine, and those outside the lazarets ?
6 "Answer.-The assemblage in a lazaret, of persons coming from a place where Cholera prevails, has not the effect of producing a great increase of the disease among those in question ; but such an assemblage is, notwithstanding, very dangerous to the neighbourhood, as it is likely to favor the propagation in it of Cholera. " Question 23rd.-What influence have great assemblages of men, armies, fairs, pilgrimages, &c., on the development and the propagation of Cholera ? " Answer.-Great assemblages of men, (armies, fairs, pilgrimages,) are among the most certain means of propagating Cholera ; they form great epidemic sources which, whether the people march as an army or scatter themselves, as from fairs and pilgrimages, carry the disease into the country they go through; those assemblages after having been subjected, in usually a rapid way, to the influence of Cholera, be- come less susceptible of it, and the disease disappears from among them, it may be even speedily, unless new arrivals come to prolong it. " Question 24th.-What influence has dispersion on the intensity and the development of epidemics of Cholera ? " Answer.-The opportune dispersion of an assemblage may lessen the violence of an epidemic of Cholera which has appeared in it, and may even prevent its spread- ing; but the dispersion would, on the contrary, cause great danger of propagation if it took place in the midst of places as yet free from the disease. " Question 25th.-What share has the pilgrimage to Mecca had, in the epide- mics of Cholera that have followed one after another up to this time ? " Answer.-The part borne by the Mecca pilgrimage, as an agent in propagat- ing Cholera in the countries bordering on Europe, has been the importation of the disease into Egypt twice, at an interval of thirty-four years, during the hot season. " Question 26th.-What influence have the sanitary and other conditions of a locality on the violence of an epidemic of Cholera; in other words, what are the adjuvant causes of cholera ? " Answer.-Sanitary and other conditions, which in general predispose a popu- lation to contract Cholera, and consequently, which favor the intensity of epidemics, are indigence with all its consequences, the crowding of individuals, their unhealthy condition, the hot season, deficiency of ventilation, exhalations from a porous soil im- pregnated with organic matter, above all if that matter be from choleraic dejections. "As it appears to be shown by experience that the dejections of those with cholera contain the generating principle of the disease, it is legitimate to admit that drains, privies, and the contaminated waters of a town, may become agents in the propa- gation of the disease. " It seems to result from certain facts, that the ground of a place once impreg- nated with choleraic matters can for a considerable time retain the power of giving off the principle of the disease and of keeping up an epidemic, or even of reproducing it when it has been extinct. " Question 27th.-What is to be understood of immunity as regards Cholera ? "Answer.-The immunity which certain localities enjoy, that is to say, the resist- ance, permanent or temporary, general or partial, opposed by those localities to the develop-
7 ment of cholera within their bounds, is a fact which does not preclude transmissibility; but which indicates that certain places, not yet all determined, are an obstacle to the deve- lopment of the disease. The more or less complete and the more or less durable immunity which the greater number of persons placed in a choleraic centre enjoy, an immunity that attests the individual's resistance to the poison, is a circumstance which should be held to be of the greatest value. Viewing it with reference to epidemic development, it is corrective of the transmissibility, and, as regards prevention, it puts on the way, means fitted to restrain the ravages of the disease. " Question 28th.-From the facts previously established, and which are con- nected with the generation, the propagation and the transmissibility of Cholera, can we deduce any thing precise as to the generating principle of the disease, or, at least, as to the mediums which serve as vehicles, or receptacles; as to the conditions of its entrance into the organism; as to the ways by which it escapes from it; as to the du- ration of its morbific activity ; in short, as to all the properties, a knowledge of which concern prophylaxis ? " Answer.-In the present state of science we can announce only hypotheses as to the nature of the generating principle of Cholera; we know only that it is indige- nous in certain countries of India, and that it maintains itself there permanently; the principle reproduces itself within man, and accompanies him in his peregrinations; it may thus be diffused to a distance from country to country, by its successive re-produc- tion, without ever generating itself spontaneously, apart from man. "Question 29th.-What are the vehicles of the generating principle of Cholera? " Question 30th.-To what distance from a centre of emission can the principle of Cholera be carried by the air ? " Answer to 29 and 30.-The ambient air is the chief vehicle of the generating agent of Cholera; but the transmission of the disease by the atmosphere, in an immense majority of cases, is limited to a distance very close to the centre of emission. The in- stances cited of transport by the atmosphere, to one or many miles distance, are not sufficiently conclusive. " Question 31st.-What are the other vehicles of the choleraic principle ? " Answer.-Water and certain ingesta may serve as vehicles for the introduc- tion of the generating principle of Cholera into the organism; the ways by which the poisonous agent penetrates are chiefly the respiratory, and very probably also, the alimentary, passages. Nothing has been ascertained as to entrance by the skin. " Question 32nd.-What are the chief receptacles of the choleraic principle ? "Answer.- Choleraic dejections being incontestably the chief receptacle of the morbific agent, it follows that all that is contaminated with those dejections also becomes a receptacle, whence the generating principle of Cholera may be set free under favoring circumstances. It follows also that the generation of the choleraic germ most probably takes place in the alimentary canal, to the exclusion, perhaps, of any other part of the organism. " Question 33rd.-What is the duration of the morbific activity of the gene- rating principle of Cholera ? " Answer.-Observation shows that the duration of choleraic Diarrha, called premonitory (which it is necessary not to confound with Diarrha that exists in  times
8 of Cholera) does not exceed a few days. The observations cited as exceptional do not prove that the cases of Diarrha which last longer are choleraic, and are capable of transmitting the disease when the individual has been removed from, all cause of contamination." Method adopted by the Committee to verify the correctness of these conclusions. 11. With a view to the verification of the accuracy of the conclusions noted above, the Inspector General of the Indian Medical Department, under date the 19th July 1867, circulated a tabular form of Return to be filled up by Medical Officers in his department, and Government issued instructions that all Collectors of Districts should furnish similar information regarding the localities under their charge. 13.

Considerable delay has occurred in the receipt of the information thus sought for ; but it has been so far satisfactory as proving the general accuracy of the conclusions arrived at by the International Sanitary Conference, and we are happy to add that we have, in connection with the subject of pilgrimages, been able to satisfy ourselves, not only that these conclusions are correct, but also that it is possible, by acting upon the precepts suggested by them, to prevent the appearance of epidemic cholera during those agglomerations of people which periodically occur in India at the celebration of certain religious festivals, and during the holding of certain fairs. tion and Propagation of Epidemic Cholera in Southern India, has been prepared by kindly acted as our Secretary.

Prom the above Table, column 8, it is evident that there are certain preliminary considerations that must he admitted as proved with regard to the dissemination of the disease in epidemic form : and thus one of the most practically important considerations coming before us may be considered as disposed of. But other questions also suggested themselves less easily decided; to these we shall afterwards allude. We may therefore as preliminary to our Report admit that certain conditions tend to the production and diffusion of this disease.

Different modes of origina- tion of Epidemics. 1.  By importation of the disease. 2.    use of tainted encamping grounds or bad water. 3.    contiguity of infected population. 4.    use of tainted carriage and clothing. 15. The possibility of the importation even of a single case leading to the occurrence of an epidemic in a camp, city or jail, is now indisputably proved; while the occurrence of epidemics from the subsequent use of camping grounds, tainted by previous occupation; and the induction of cholera by water tainted by cholera dejections, are now facts in its etiology which must be accepted without dispute. Similarly, experience has sadly proved that passing near villages, where the disease is prevalent, has been a frequent means of introducing it among troops marching, or of imparting it to casual travellers. Clothing, carts
22 employed for the transport of baggage, &c. are now recognized means of the dissemination  of the disease; while the use of water which, though not actually holding cholera germs in it, is found to be largely charged with animal or vegetable impurities in a state of decomposition, has been so frequently observed to be the exciting cause of the disease, that the danger of using it can be no longer overlooked. Endemicity of the disease in India. 16. The question of the endemicity of the disease in certain places likely to prove foci of epidemic sickness is of extreme importance, and we believe all the evidence on this point is opposed to the idea. The Cholera Congress endeavoured to determine whether any places in India exist where alone Cholera is engendered or which are found by experience to be particularly favorable to its development, or, in other words, Is cholera endemic in all parts of India or only in certain districts which it is possible to circumscribe ? Conclusions of the Conference and the importance of these. 17. The Conference were led to think, probably correctly, that places where cholera is really endemic in India are not very numerous. If this surmise (in the supposed correctness of which we con- cur) could be established as a fact, it would be of very great importance and would be followed probably by practical results of the highest importance.  Once these original sources of the disease were ascertained, their peculiarities could be carefully studied and every effort of sanitary science directed to the extinction  of the disease at its source. Alleged endemicity of cholera. 18. The Conference named a few places, where, they were informed that cholera reigned by preference as an endemic disease, these were, Calcutta, Cawnpore, Allahabad, at Bombay, and Arcot in the Madras Presidency. The Conference were further informed that cholera appeared epidemically every year or nearly every year at Madras, Conjeveram, Pooree, Tripatty, Mahadeo, Trivellore and other places where congregations of Hindoo pilgrims resort, and that the disease appears as an epidemic at certain intervals which do not, for the most part, exceed four or five years in the North-west of Hindoostan; also in all parts of the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay, and in Pegu. The enquiries of this Commission do not confirm the foregoing opinion. Cholera not considered as endemic in any part of this Presidency. 19. In the foregoing conclusions we are unable to concur unreservedly. We have carefully examined all the evidence that we could collect, with a view to arriving at a reliable conclusion regarding  the endemicity of cholera in any place, within the limits of observation presented to us by the voluminous returns which we have collected throughout the Madras Presidency ; and, without stating it as a fact clearly proved, the impression on our mind is, that there is no place within  this Presidency where cholera is proved to be endemic; and further that the great preponderance of evidence goes to prove that epidemics of cholera in cities and districts are distinctly attributable in almost every instance to the importation of the disease in epidemic form by pilgrims, ordinary travellers and troops marching. Cholera not endemic in Madras. 20. We may with advantage, give an example of supposed endemicity now apparently disproved in the case of the city of Madras, where cholera has been for so many years almost continuously present, and where it is  generally considered to be almost endemic. The experience
?23 of the past twelve months, as recorded in Dr. Montgomery's Mortuary Reports for that period, would tend to dissipate the idea, that the disease is properly regarded as being due, either to any inherent property in the soil or to any personal habits or peculiari- ties of constitution on the part of the permanent residents of the town. Arrangement of subject of enquiry. 21. There is little doubt that the chief points of practical importance, to which the attention of Government may now with the greatest  advantage be directed, are those which refer to:- (1.)    The primary origination of a cholera epidemic; (2.)    The method of the diffusion of the disease; (3.)    The prevention of circumstances favorable to this diffusion; and, (4.)    The dissipation of the disease when established in an epidemic form. Method of enquiry proposed in the present Report. 22. We believe that the object of our present report will be best carried out if we confine our observations to the practical details upon which the orders of Government may be required; or in other words, if we submit a brief statement of the circumstances under which Cholera usually assumes an epidemic form, and of the regulations by which we believe that the appearance and dissemination of the disease may possibly be prevented. Origination of epidemics due chiefly to contagion from pilgrimages. 23. All the evidence in our possession, whether derived from the Cholera Congress or from our own enquiries, seem to point so distinct- ly to the contagiousness of the disease, that the most practi- cal use to which we can apply this knowledge is to investigate  the origination and progress of the disease, under the different circumstances wherein it has been observed, as affecting masses of the community. The frequency with which epidemic cholera has originated from religious pilgrimages and fairs, has been already sufficiently investigated in our report regarding the "Control of Pilgrim- ages" in this Presidency. The subject of pilgrimages has been sufficiently discussed. 24. This, the most notable condition under which Cholera, would seem to be originated and propagated has already been fully reported upon by us, and the Sanitary Commissioner has been so good as to lay before us his further report on the same subject. From these papers Government will have learned the general principles upon which the measures for the prevention of epidemic cholera should be based. Additional subjects to be now considered. 25. We do not think it necessary therefore again to enter upon the discussion  of the points therein set forth ; but turn in preference to a practical consideration of the circumstances other than those connected with pilgrimages, under which this disease has been known to occur. Many of these appear to us equally to indicate means by which, possibly, the appearance of the disease may be prevented, or its dissemination arrested. The results of experience regarding the transmission of the disease claim especial at- tention. 26. We therefore at once pass to the consideration of the transmissibility and propagation of the disease. On this subject the Congress stated:- "That all facts hitherto ascertained demonstrate that cholera is propagated  by man, and with a speed proportioned to the amount and rapidity of his emigration
?24 That it is a law hitherto without exception that cholera has never advanced quicker than man in his emigrations, and that hitherto no fact has proved that cholera can spread to a distance by the atmosphere alone, whatever may be its condition." "The Conference further conclude that the Diarrha called premonitory, may transmit cholera, and that cholera can be transmitted by articles of personal pro- perty coming from an infected place, and especially by those which have been used by sufferers under cholera; and that certain facts prove that the disease may be carried to a distance by such articles, shut up from the access of fresh air." 27. All these conclusions are supported by the facts contained in the Medi- cal records of this Presidency and are of great importance in considering the means to be employed in the prevention of the disease in this country. 28. We beg to call particular attention to the conclusions of the Conference to the 20th question, vide p. 5. "What is the influence of assemblages or congregations (agglomerations) of men, on the intensity of epidemics of cholera; also on the propa- gation of the disease? and under what conditions does that influence operate ?" The reply of the Conference is as follows:-1st, "That every assemblage of men in which cholera appears, is a condition favorable to the rapid extension of the disease; and, if the assemblage is in a bad sanitary condition, to the violence of the epidemic." 2nd, " That, in like circumstances, the rapidity of the extension is in proportion to the concentration of the congregated mass, while the violence of the epidemic (all other things being equal) is the greater, the less the individuals have already been under a choleraic influence, or if they remain uncontaminated by it; that is to say, in other words, that those who have been already under the influence of a source of cholera have a kind of relative and temporary immunity that counterbalances the grievous effect of the agglomeration. Lastly, that in a congregated mass, the more rapidly the epidemic spreads the more rapidly does it also cease, unless new healthy arrivals furnish fresh aliment to the disease and so sustain it." Various conditions under which epidemic cholera is  most usually observed. 29. Accepting the foregoing conclusions (of the correctness of which we entertain no doubt,) we have to determine the practical appli- cation of the facts here asserted, considering seriatim the various conditions under which epidemic cholera is most usually observed, and, in connection with the subject, detailing the practical mea- sures, the adoption of which we would recommend as being calculated to prevent its extension. The circumstances under which cholera is most usually observed as an epidemic are:- (I). In cities, villages and towns. (II). In Military cantonments. (III). Among European troops on the march. (IV). Among Native troops on the march. (V). During, or subsequent to, agglomerations of people at pilgrimages and fairs. (VI). In Jails. (VII). In Hospitals, and lastly, (VIII). In sea-port towns into which the disease is directly imported by ships.
?25 General considerations equ- ally applying to all the fore- going conditions. 30. With reference to all the foregoing, we think it may be now safely asserted, that the conditions of the elements, Earth, Air and Water, may tend essentially to regulate the pre-disposition or otherwise of certain places to the reception of cholera; and it will be found on examination to be equally certain, that the same principles must be acted upon in each instance of an epidemic, in order to dissipate the disease when once established. It will not therefore be necessary to repeat in each instance the specific reasons upon which our suggestions are based, or the detailed arguments, which point to the propriety of the remedial measures which should be adopted in each separate instance. 31. Our endeavour is, rather to lay before Government a general outline of preventive and curative measures, the details of which must be modified so as to suit the various conditions under which this disease is witnessed. General principles of pre- vention widely applicable. Air. 32. The purity of the Air; its sufficiency in quantity; its free circulation, both outside and inside all places of occupation; the absence from it of deleterious gases, and especially those arising from the decomposition of organic matters, are all circumstances conducive to a satisfactory condition of the public health and freedom from epidemic diseases. Water. 33. Water should be pure in quality, free from organic matter, and in suffi- cient quantity: a failure in any of these respects is injuri- ous to public health. Soil. 34. The soil if impregnated by organic and more especially by excremen- titious matter, acts injuriously on the health of those resid- ing upon it; tends to render the water and the air impure; and should, as far as possible, be avoided for occupation. Conclusions of the Confer- ence on the foregoing- 35. The foregoing considerations apply equally to all places permanently occupied by men, and to them all are applicable the three following conclusions of the Cholera Congress:- "1. The sanitary conservancy of towns is an efficacious means of opposing the reception of cholera and of lessening its ravages. "2. This conservancy should be based chiefly on a combination of measures tending to maintain the purity of the air, to supply the town with abundance of whole- some water and to hinder the contamination of the ground with organic matters. "3. The immediate disinfection and the removal of excrementitious matters, are sanitary measures of the highest importance, especially in times of cholera." How these views should be carried out. 36. The practical measures, the adoption of which seem most calculated to secure the foregoing desiderata, are as follows, and are equally applicable to all places permanently inhabited by man. How to maintain the purity of air in Cities, &c. 37. The prevention of overcrowding in inhabited buildings; the due ventila- tion of all cities and barracks by broad roads and open spaces of ground between contiguous blocks of buildings; the aboli- tion of cesspits, heaps of sewage and surface impurities generally; the rapid and inoffensive removal of all decomposing animal and vegetable
?26 substances and especially excrementitious matter, are all essential to maintaining a pure condition of the atmosphere. The conservancy, from impurity, of all water stand- ing and running, and the institution of surface and subsoil drainage, must also be attended to; the last two points being essential to prevent the emanation from the soil of deleterious gases calculated to render the air impure, and, for the same reason, the removal of all manufactories, likely to constitute nuisances or act prejudicially to the public health, must be insisted upon. Water supply how to be protected from contamina- tion. 38. The provision of a water supply not liable to be injuriously affected by the contamination of surface or subsoil; the examination of all well-water used for drinking and cooking purposes, with a view to its purity being ascertained or its use discon- tinued if proved to be impure; the removal, from the vicinity of wells used for these purposes, of all cesspits, sewage drains, cart stands and places of public interment of dead bodies; the disinfection and burial, at a distance from all water supply, of all cholera and other excreta requiring immediate disposal; the conservancy of rain-water in suitable reservoirs when it can be collected from clean gathering grounds, water sheds, barrack roofs, &c., are all matters of the highest importance. The foregoing subjects need, not be reiterated. 39. The foregoing points need not be again adverted to in the following detailed observations; but they must be accepted as the preliminary essentials to the institution of any complete system of sanitation, whether this is to be adopted in the limited space of ground attached to individual buildings or in the wide area of a popu- lous city or cantonment. Several of the measures here recommended are not novel. 40. In defining the several measures, the adoption of which we would re- commend under the several conditions specified in para. 32, we are aware that we are reiterating many recommendations which have already been submitted to, and approved and act- ed on by, the several Governments in India; but we are unwilling to omit them from what may, we hope, prove the basis of a code of regulations calculated we trust to eventuate in the almost complete extinction of this, most fatal, disease. We are appre- hensive that under these circumstances the omission of any precautionary measure might imply a question on our part as to the propriety of its enforcement; while a de- tailed system of sanitation is more likely to be readily accepted, and willingly carried out, if submitted in complete and systematic form. I. OUTLINE OF MEASURES OF SANITATION FOR THE PREVENTION AND CHECK OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN CITIES, VILLAGES AND TOWNS. General principles of Con- servancy of Towns. 41. In addition to the measures detailed in paras. 32, 33 and 34, which are simply the first principles of sanitation, attention to the fol- lowing subjects will be requisite (where they are practicable) in order to secure immunity from epidemic disease:-house con- servancy, including drainage of basements; removal of excreta, periodical lime-washing, daily cleaning out of all dust bins, removal of bath, cooking and waste water; adequate ventilation; the removal of all cattle from human habitations and the provision of suitable means, either domestic or public, for personal ablutions; the examination of all articles of food; disinfection of all houses inhabited by persons suffering from the disease; the
?27 destruction of clothing; the early sepulture of all bodies of persons dead from contagi- ous disease; the due observation for a period of not less than five days of individuals, or large bodies of men, arriving from localities, either far distant or known to be affected by epidemic disease; the printing and general distribution of simple instructions, for the treatment of premonitory symptoms, &c. and the gratuitous supply, through the police or other suitable agency, of medicines suited for the check of the premonitory or earlier stages of the disease. The probable results of the adoption of these principles. Improved public health. 42. It is scarcely necessary for us to state that the foregoing must be con- sidered as merely an outline of the leading points which re- quire attention on the part of individual house-holders and of the municipalities of the various towns in India. But we cannot allow this opportunity to pass without recording our deliberate opinion that sys- tematic attention to these points will, in time, be followed by such an improvement in the condition of public health as would more than justify any expenditure necessary to carry into operation the princi- ples which we advocate. There is reason to believe that the normal health of the rural and urbane populations in India would, in the absence of epidemic disease, bear a not unfavorable comparison with that of other countries in more temperate climates, Epidemic disease in crowd- ed towns, during famine and from want of European me- dical advice. 43. It is to the prevalence of epidemic disease, which rapidly acquires viru- lence in ill conserved native towns, that high mortality is due, especially among a population occasionally exposed to the depressing influence of famine and, in many cases, una- voidably, not in a position to reap the advantages of Euro- pean medical science. While therefore we gratefully record our sense of the vast impor- tance of the measures which have recently been adopted in this Presidency to ward off impending famine, or to liberally relieve existing distress, and while we regard the establishment of civil dispensaries as of the highest possible importance, we would ear- nestly urge upon Government the equally great necessity which exists for impressing, upon municipal and civil authorities, the absolute necessity of causing to be enforced the practical application of the principles we have laid down for the conservancy of towns. Institution of broad streets greatly required. Their utility demonstrated in Madras. 44. We would here again revert to the great importance of enforcing regu- lations calculated to ensure the advantage of thorough ven- tilation of populous localities. We now believe it to be un- doubted that, in this city, the opening up of broad streets in various directions has result- ed in a marked improvement in the health of those inhabiting adjacent houses, and we are strongly of opinion, that in the absence of municipalities, that power preventing the erection of houses, only separated by narrow streets, should be granted to competent civil authorities under legislative enactment. II. MILITARY CANTONMENTS. Rules for Military Canton- ments. 45. In addition to the foregoing and other ordinary precautions, it will be necessary to prevent the entrance of troops or their families if affected with contagious disease; to enforce the exclusion of bands of pilgrims and their diversion, if possible in a direction to leeward; to prevent intercommunication between residents in cantonments and the inhabitants of adjoining
?28 * The constant provision of an adequate supply of camp equipage for each arm of the service there stationed. villages or bazaars, if these are affected by epidemic disease,* to inculcate the selection, preparation and conservancy of cholera camps of sufficiently easy access and, if possible, to be approached without un- necessary travelling along public roads. 46. On the occurrence of cholera the adoption of the following Rules origi- nally promulgated by the Cholera Commission and approved by Dr. Budd, one of the leading authorities on this subject, is strongly recommended. Rules for arresting Cholera among Troops in Infected Barracks. "1st.-The troops to be removed at once, if possible, from the infected bar- racks, and to be encamped on high ground. "2nd.-All who maybe attacked after their removal, to be separated from their healthy comrades the moment the first symptoms appear. "3rd.-All discharges from the sick (including those vomited) to be received, on their issue from the body, into vessels containing a saturated solution of chloride of zinc, or some other powerful disinfectant. "4th.-The latrines or other places which serve as the final receptacles of these discharges, to be reserved exclusively for that use. "5th.-All latrines belonging to the Camp to be strewed, night and morning, with a mixture of peat charcoal and chloride of lime. "6th.-All tainted linen, bedding, &c., to be burnt immediately after its removal from the sick. "7th.-The hands of all attendants on the sick to be scrupulously cleaned (by means of sand and water, containing some disinfectant), whenever they have become soiled by 'rice-water.' "8th.-The utmost care to be taken in providing drinking water; and, where any doubt exists as to its quality, the water to be boiled and filtered through charcoal before use. "9th.-The interior of the infected barracks to be fumigated with chlorine or sulphurous acid. "10th.-Existing privies and the drains connected with them to be built over, or otherwise abolished, where necessary, after a preliminary disinfection by the free use of chloride of lime or peat charcoal. "11th.-Convalescents to be kept, for some time, in separation from the healthy troops. Troops on the march. 47. In addition to the foregoing regulations, which in most part equally apply to the management of the sick in station hospitals and in camps, it is necessary that measures, both of a preven- tive and curative character, should be adopted when troops are marching, and the points of leading importance in this respect will be found detail- ed below in para. 54 of this Report.
?29 Identity of recommenda- tions for Station and March- ing Cholera Camps. 48. But some of the recommendations, therein contained, are equally applicable to the stational cholera camps which have been established for the use of all the principal stations through- out this Presidency. We consider it right therefore to direct attention to them here as in case of the continuance of an epidemic in a station cholera camp, the troops are in many respects placed in a condition strictly identical with that pertaining during the prevalence of cholera on the march. Rules for Cholera Camps. 49. Under these circumstances the following recommendations are in part adapted from General Orders issued on the 7th of April 1862 by H. E. (the late) Commander-in-Chief of India, and are submitted for approval. (1.)-The cholera camp should be broken up into as many detachments as the number of the Medical Officers will admit, allowing one to each party. Should the commissioned medical staff be insufficient for this, experienced Medical Subordi- nates might be placed in charge of small parties. (2.)-Should cholera continue the troops should be moved daily to distances of two or three miles, their route being directed as far as possible at right angles to the then prevalent wind and track of the disease : care being taken also to avoid march- ing along public roads lest the troops should, themselves, tend to diseminate the disease through the rural population. (3.)-Care should be taken on these marches to avoid approaching towns or villages at a less distance than one mile. The men should not be allowed to leave the ranks for the purpose of getting water which should be carried with them, and the necessary precautions should be adopted for the disinfection and burying of any excreta which may, unavoidably, have to be disposed of during the march. (4.)-As far as possible the men should be encouraged to have recourse to such amusements as are available in camp. (5.)-The use of stimulants in excess of that sanctioned by Government should be strictly prohibited. (6.)-Intercourse with travellers, villagers or any persons whose entrance into the camp is not distinctly permitted by the Commanding Officer should, in every possible way, be prevented. (7.)-The men should be made aware of the extreme importance of their, at once, reporting illness of a character premonitory of cholera; but men under treat- ment for such symptoms should, if admitted to camp hospital, be treated distinctly apart from undoubted cases of the disease. Further suggestions on same subject. 50. The following points must be invariably attended to :-The treatment of all cases of cholera in (temporary) wards or tents, used for this purpose only ; the destruction of all hospital cloth- ing used by cholera patients; the professional inspection of all families twice in the twenty hours ; the fumigation of all family quarters, whether infected with disease or not; the careful examination of all articles of food.
?30 Removal of Troops to Cholera Camps. 51. Regarding the removal of Troops from Cantonments we recommend that the particular body of men attacked by the disease, should be at once sent into camp, and that the other troops should be similarly dealt with should the disease show a tendency to spread; that carriage used for the sick, should not, under any circumstances, be subsequently used for the transport of clothing, provisions, or persons in health, until it has been thoroughly purified. Cots in Camp for all Troops. No European sick order- lies. Funeral parties to be discontinued. 52. We also consider it of importance that, when the weather is wet, all troops European or Native, whether sick or well, should be provided with cots; that in camps, separate hospital accom- modation should be provided for ordinary and epidemic sick; that European soldiers should not be employed as sick orderlies during the existence of epidemic disease; that funeral parties and firing at funerals should be discontinued; and that dead bodies should be removed, either being borne by native coolies or in carriage other than that usually employed for this purpose. III. CHOLERA AMONG EUROPEAN TROOPS ON THE MARCH. Railway travelling by Military Troops. 53. So judicious has been the attention which has been directed to this important subject, that we have little to add to the follow- ing recommendations promulgated by H. E. the Command- er-in-Chief of Madras, under date the 22nd January 1866. The only point which appears to us to have been overlooked, are the special considerations which are neces- sary with regard to the transfer of troops by railway. With reference to this subject we would recommend attention to the following points. Rules recommended for adoption. (1.)-That no body of Europeans should travel for more than twelve hours continuously by rail. (2.)-That strict orders should be issued for the provision of their customary meals to be in waiting at the station next adjacent to the place where they will proba- bly be, at the usual hour appointed for such meals. (3.)-That if possible, where large bodies of men are to be thus moved, they should go in special trains, running at as high a rate of speed as is consistent with the Railway arrangements and the convenience of the public. (4.)-That these trains should stop not less than once in 4 hours for a period of half an hour. (5.)-That at such halting stations an ample provision of good drinking water should be provided; but that no articles of food of any description should be offered for sale at any station, and that the men should not be allowed to leave the carriages during the halt and wander beyond the strict limits of the railway platform or enclosure. (6.)-That, when halting for meals, the men should be rigidly restricted from access to adjacent native bazaars or towns. (7.)-That separate and suitable accommodation should be provided for any sick, the nature of whose cases may not necessitate there being left behind.
31 (8.)-That independent of such accommodation one or more empty vans (without seats) should form a portion of the train. To these might be transferred any emergent cases or cases of epidemic sickness and a suitable number of straw paillasses might be kept ready in these vans. (9.)-That a competent Medical Officer should accompany each large party of men, and that he should be provided with suitable medicines and medical appliances all ready prepared for the treatment of emergent cases of sickness or accident. (10.)-That, invariably, Commissioned Medical Officers in charge should be accompanied by a suitable subordinate medical establishment, and that these should be accommodated in a separate carriage or compartment to be rendered conspicuous by a suitable placard. (11.)-That on the occasion of the periodical haltings of the train, the Medical Officer in charge should distinctly enquire as to the state of health of the men in each separate compartment or carriage. (12.)-Lastly, that if possible, the special trains should run between the hours of 6 A. M. and 6 P. M. General Order regarding the marching of Troops. 54. The following is the order above referred to in para 47. Cholera on the March. 1. "Prior to the march of Troops, it should be ascertained whether Cholera prevails on the road. 2. "Particular attention must, at all times, be given to the selection of en- camping grounds, for which, whenever practicable, elevated and dry situations should be chosen, sufficiently removed from the village or town, and from the influence of swamps or pools of stagnant water. The banks of rivers are to be avoided. Officers are strictly enjoined never, under any circumstances, to encamp upon ground, however inviting it may appear, where Cholera has shown itself in a preceding Corps or Detachment. 3. "Officers Commanding Corps or Detachments in movement, are to con- sult with the Officer in medical charge, regarding the healthiness of the site upon which they propose encamping, and in such cases, Officers are to be guided by medical opinion unless they shall see weighty reasons for setting it aside, which are at once to be re- ported to the Quarter Master General for the information of the Commander-in-Chief. 4. "In the event of the Troops, or followers being attacked by sickness, it is directed that the greatest attention be paid to the selection of encamping ground; that it be high, dry and clean; and this, it is considered, may generally be found at some slight sacrifice of convenience, with respect to water and supplies, which, however, in the case supposed, must be looked upon as of minor importance. 5. "Officers whose Camps may be attacked by Cholera, are strictly enjoined to avoid encamping near towns or villages; and to allow no further communication with the inhabitants than may be absolutely necessary for the supply of provisions; and this under such restrictions, as may confine it to the healthiest part of the Camp. 6. "The same rules are to be followed when passing through a district, or through a town or village, in which the disease may exist.
?32 7. "In cases where the violence of the disease may render the measure ne- cessary, Officers will halt altogether on any eligible spot within reach, or merely move their Camp for change of air, and clean encamping ground, until it may appear advis- able to move on. Whenever practicable, the Corps or Detachment should be broken up into as many divisions as can be properly provided with medical aid, and separate encampments formed one or two miles apart-measures being taken to prevent com- munication. 8. "So long as Cholera exists in Camp, a daily report of cases and deaths is to be forwarded to the Quarter Master General; European and Native are to be separately shown, and the names of all European Officers attacked or deceased, are to be reported. 9. "In cases of extraordinary sickness, Officers Commanding Corps and Detachments are authorized to indent upon Collectors, or the Commissariat Depart- ment, for such number of country cots as may be absolutely necesssary. 10. "When sufficient medical aid is available, and there is no Military necessity for marching entire, Regiments will march by Wings, at an interval of ten days. 11. " On every occasion of halt, orders should be issued and enforced for a thorough washing of all the clothes and for the complete purification of the carts, and the matting which forms the hood of the carts. Officers Commanding are especially enjoined to see that these instructions are rigidly carried out, as it has been proved by experience that this is one of the most effectual modes of preventing Cholera or of miti- gating its attacks. In the Progress Report, it should be noted that this has been done. Care should be taken that the water used for this purpose is not that used for drinking. A guard should be invariably placed over the latter to prevent its contamination. 12. "Should Cholera attack the Regiment, it is desirable that a divergence from the road of 4 or 5 miles should be made at right angles to the prevalent wind or track of the disease. But this will seldom be practicable on account of the want of sup- plies on a road on which notice has not been given. * * * * *  Conservancy of Camps. 25. "With a view to preserving the conservancy of Camps and encamping grounds, the Commander-in-Chief directs that the system should be adopted in Camp as is the practice in all Military Cantonments, the main principle of which is, the daily burial of all refuse matter. 26. "It is therefore to be at once established as a Standing Order among all European Troops moving in course of relief, or otherwise, that 2 trenches, each 2 feet deep, 2 feet wide, and 50 feet long, are to be dug by coolies to be employed for the pur- pose at a distance of 120 yards from the flanks of each encamping ground, the inward flanks of such trenches to be 120 yards from the outward flanks of the Camp, that is, in echellon; but should the nature of the ground prevent their location according to this rule, the same principle for their location is to be observed, that is, they are not on any account to be directly in front or rear of the Camp, but in echellon on their flanks, be- ing so placed that the prevailing wind is not to carry the effluvia to the Camp; these trenches are never to be in such proximity to wells as to make percolation to the water possible. 27. "The Quarter Master, or whoever is entrusted with the formation of
?33 the encampment, is to see that this arrangment is made daily at the advance ground before the arrival of the Troops, and a flag or other mark should be placed to show the position of the trenches, one of which is to be allotted for the European Soldiers, and the other for the Native Camp followers, &c., of a British Regiment: the same principle is also to be strictly enforced for Native Regiments, Cavalry or Infantry, on the march. Officers Commanding are to allot a certain site or position, in the vicinity (but not too close) of each encamping ground, for the use of the Native Soldiery and Camp followers. The present practice of defiling the ground on all sides of the Camp must be strictly prohibited. 28. " These trenches are to be thoroughly filled in with earth by coolies before the Rear Guard quits the ground, and for those duties the coolies should be properly divided between the advance and main Camps, and the Officer on duty with the Rear Guard is to be required to report to the Commanding Officer that the trenches have been so filled in, and, in the case of Native Troops, that the "sites" specially select- ed have been properly cleaned. 29. "The Commanding Officer of every Regiment or Detachment on the march is required to place himself in direct communication with the Tahsildar, or other responsible Native functionary at each encamping ground, to arrange that effectual measures are adopted by the Native local authorities for thoroughly sweeping and cleaning the whole area of each encamping ground immediately it is cleared of the Camp, as well as the " sites" above referred to, and for burning or removing to a suit- able distance all collections of stable litter or refuse of every kind, &c., so as to make the ground perfectly fit for re-occupation by any Troops marching by the same route. 30. "In the event of Troops forming a standing Camp for exercise or other duties, or halting more than the ordinary time at any Camp ground, an additional deep trench should be dug at a distance of at least 200 yards from the Camp, and to leeward of it, on the same conditions as the first trenches, for the reception of filth twice every day; coolies removing it from the Camp trenches before mentioned, and depositing it in the deeper and distinct trench, as is done from the Latrines in Cantonments, and covering over with earth each day's accumulation. 31. "Enquiries are also to be made by the Quarter Master, or other res- ponsible Officer of the Regiment, at each advance ground, from the same Native func- tionaries, as to whether the well water has been recently drawn, and the well in a state fit for use for drinking and other purposes ; if not, effectual arrangements must be made for rendering it so before the arrival of the Troops on the encamping ground. 32. " In the Progress Reports furnished by Regiments to the Quarter-Master General of the Army, a note is in future to be entered that these orders have been strictly carried out. 33. "The coolies to be employed are to be supplied by the Native local authorities on the requisition of the Commanding Officer in such numbers as may be actually required. Payment will be made on Contingent Bills vouched in the usual
34 manner, and forwarded to the Quarter-Master General to be disposed of, as are all other contingent expenses on a march. 34.     "The requisition for the coolies should be made by the Commanding Officer at the same time that he furnishes the Civil authorities with the Indent for supplies. 35.     "In the event of difficulty being found in supplying coolies, a working party from the Regiment must be told off to dig the trenches and fill them with earth but not to remove the excreta. 36.    Regimental intrenching tools are to be used. Families on the March.                       37. "The following arrangements are ordered with reference to the movement of the families of Troops, Euro- pean and Native, 38.     "Officers Commanding Regiments, are allowed the discretion of send- ing the families in advance of the men in the afternoon, or of suffering them to follow the Regiment; but the former course is to be preferred when it can be adopted without inconvenience. 39.     "If the road is good and the obstruction of rivers, &c., does not occur, the families may generally arrive soon after the Regiment on the ground. When it is otherwise, it is better that the families should precede the men. But in either case, the Regimental Artificers and a strong working party from the Regiment, under a Non- Commissioned Officer, should accompany the carts to assist them in case of need. 40.     "The Quarter Master of the Regiment will mark out, on the new ground, a site for the families to leeward of the ground chosen for the Camp of the men, and at some distance from it. Crowding of the bandies should be prohibited, and the bullocks should be removed to the rear. No carts ought to be allowed to leave the camp during the night, as they create disturbance and obstruct the road for the Regiment in the morning. 41.     "The Officer Commanding will take particular care that unripe fruit and other sources of disease, are not sold in the Camp nor brought to it. Frequent in- spection of the bazaars should be ordered. 42.     "In order to maintain men and families in health, they should be en- couraged to eat heartily, and to bring to speedy notice any attacks of diarrha or any premonitory symptoms of Cholera, however slight." IV. CHOLERA AMONG NATIVE TROOPS ON THE MARCH. Honorable Mr. Ellis' Report on marching of Native Troops. 55. "The question of the measures to be adopted on the march of Native In- fantry Regiments was very fully gone into by the late Sani- tary Commissioner the Honorable Mr. Ellis. As his report,on the subject has already been submitted to Government and has received general sanction in their order in the Military Department, No. 2074,dated 3rd June 1865 para. 7 we need do little more than note the general results which were arrived at by Mr. Ellis as regards cholera.

By the following table, it will be seen that the attacks progressively increase with the duration of the march, till about the end of the 3rd month; when these reach as high as 61 per cent, in the Infantry, after which period the proportion of attacks would appear to diminish, though amongst the Cavalry and Artillery it increases.

It is clearly shown in the following table that large bodies of men are, when marching, more liable to attack than small detachments, and that the death rate is in proportion higher.

Strength of the Troops. 59. These tables were prepared by Dr. Lorimer in 1842, and from them it will be- seen, that the ratio of attacks to inarches was sensibly  higher in proportion to the strength of the bodies of the troops marching, and that the death-rate from cholera followed  a similar progression. Detachments. Thus in the case of detachments, 18 per cent. only of marches were attended by cholera, while, when bodies of 1,000 men and upwards marched, the proportion of marches attended by cholera was 31 per cent. Numbers in Camp. 60. The death rate from cholera would also appear to be influenced in the same degree by the numbers congregated. In detachments of from 100 to 300 attacked by cholera, the death rate was 24 per mille, while in bodies of 1,000 and upwards it was 48 per mille. Duration of Marches. 61. It will also be observed from these tables that the duration of marches seems to exercise a considerable influence on the liability of troops to attacks of cholera, for from Tables B. and C. it will be seen that the attacks progressively increase up to a certain point, with the duration of the march, either in distance or time, short marches being comparatively exempt from attack. Same subject. 62. Thus out of 108 marches, which lasted less than 20 days, only 9 were attended by cholera. Of 10 marches, which lasted from 100 to 120 days, 5 were attended by cholera. As regards distance, out of 144 marches under 200 miles, 130 escaped cholera. Out of 222 marches, extending from 200 to 400 miles, only 164 were free from cholera. Out of 27 marches from 600 to 800 miles, only 11 escaped, while out of 6 marches, from 800 to 1,052 miles, only 2 escaped. Peculiarity of Madras N. I. Regts. as contrasted with those of Bengal. 63. We think we cannot too prominently bring these facts to notice. The Madras Regiments are always accompanied by the sepoys' families and by crowds of followers, and their greater subjection to cholera than native soldiers in other Presidencies may, in a great measure, be attributed to the greater agglomeration of numbers.
?37 64. These facts should have considerable weight in determining in time of Practical conclusions.            peace the frequency of reliefs and the duration of marches. Arrangements already sanctioned. 65. It will be seen from our remarks in para. 54, that the sending of the families both of European and Native Regiments in advance of the men in the afternoon has received the conditional sanction of H. E. the late Commander-in-Chief; while the necessity of preventing the crowding of their bandies, the propriety of the removal of bullocks to the rear and the ensurement of quiet in the camp during the night, have already received official sanction. Movement of N. I. Regts. by wings and by Railways and Steamer recommended. 66. It remains therefore only for us to bring prominently to the notice of Government the extreme desirability, if not necessity, of enforcing Mr. Ellis' recommendation that Native Infantry Regiments should, as a rule, be marched by wings and that, as far as possible, advantage should be taken of railways, steamers, &c.; so as to lessen the probability of the Regiment contracting or disseminating the disease on the line of march. Cholera Camps on the march of N.I. Regts. 67. Regarding the measures which should be adopted when cholera actually breaks out on the line of march, the rules already set forth by H. E. the Commander-in-Chief are equally applicable to European and Native troops, and we have in para. 50, with reference to the outbreak of cholera in cantonments and the subsequent management of the cholera camps, sufficiently indicated the further points to which attention should be directed.     V. DURING, OR SUBSEQUENT TO, AGGLOMERATIONS OF PEOPLE AT PILGRIMAGES                                      AND FAIRS.  This subject already dis- posed of. 68. This subject has, as noted in para. 24, been already sufficiently discussed; but we quote from the Sanitary Commissioner's draft Report on this subject, the following sketch of the arrangements which should be made at fairs and festivals for the prevention of epidemic disease. These are now about to be submitted to Government by him. His proposals meet our entire approval. SKETCH RULES FOR THE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE IN THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVANCY OF FAIRS AND FESTIVALS. I.-Accommodation. "Make suitable provision for the probable number of persons who may not be able to find accommodation in adjacent towns and villages; as follows:- i.-Select level and lay out suitable encamping ground; bearing in mind the principal requirements of elevation, proximity to place of concourse, sufficiency of a pure water supply, dry, clean and untainted soil and direction of prevailing winds. ii.-Lay out the ground in divisions, or sections, separated by streets not less than 40 feet wide, and where space permits with subsidiary streets 20 feet wide.
?38 iii.-Erect upon these sites temporary sheds or huts for the accommodation of those who may require them. iv.-Leave space to the leeward of each section for the carts and cattle of the people occupying each section. V.-As far as possible assign sections to different castes, indicating each by a legible sign board. II.-Conservancy. 1.     "Erect suitable latrines for males and females, in number sufficient to meet the requirements of the crowd. 2.     "Establish separate pits for the burial of (a) rubbish and (b) filth. 3.     "Organize a conservancy establishment according to requirements for the following purposes: (a). The removal daily of all rubbish and refuse, including the dung of cattle, from the streets both of the town and camp, and from the camp- ing ground generally. (b). The removal of all human excreta from the public latrines and from residences within the town. (c). The disposal of the same in the filth pits. III.- Water Supply. 1.     "Select suitable but distinct tanks, wells, reservoirs or other sources of water supply (a). For drinking and domestic purposes only. (b). For bathing; and, (c). For watering cattle. 2.     "Place a Police guard over the source of supply selected for drinking, to guard it from contamination. 3.     "Establish water pandalls for the distribution of drinking water. IV.-Medical Supervision. 1.     "Appoint as Sanitary Officer a Medical or Subordinate Medical Officer, whose duty it shall be to superintend the sanitary arrangements generally; to visit the hospitals and places for distribution of medicines; to make himself acquainted with the medical history of the assemblage, as far as possible by from day to day keeping a return of all deaths reported through the Police. 2.     "Establish temporary hospitals with suitable establishments at conve- nient sites and in numbers proportionate to the assembly. 3.      "Depute medical subordinates to examine, at the barriers, all travellers, coming or departing, who may appear to be laboring under sickness. 4.     "Distribute, through suitable agency and at selected localities," cholera pills," for immediate use by persons attacked by Cholera.
?39 V.-Precautions against accidents. 1.     "Assign gates for ingress and egress into each town, temple or shrine, in cases in which numbers are considerable, and where instances of loss of life have occur- red from want of due arrangements of this nature. 2.     "Erect barriers, when necessary, to prevent an undue influx of people into limited areas, fully occupied by devotees; admitting fresh worshippers only as numbers decrease by egress from the opposite barrier gate. VI.-Police (Sanitary). 1.     "The Officers of Police to be instructed to bring to the notice of the Sanitary Officer, all deaths occurring within the limits of the camp or town. 2.     "Publicity to be given, through the Police, to the fact that hospitals are established and depts opened for the distribution of Cholera medicines. 3.     "Notices to this effect to be posted, in the vernacular, all over the town and camp, and pilgrims or those frequenting fairs to be instructed to apply for such medicines on the first occurrence of illness. 4.    "Notices of the arrangements made for the general convenience of the people to be also freely distributed amongst them, and posted upon all conspicuous places. VII.-Construction of Latrines. 1.     "Latrines to consist of walled enclosures, in which parallel trenches should be dug, 2 feet wide by 3 feet deep. The soil removed from these trenches to be stored at their edges and a portion daily shovelled in to cover the night soil. 2.     "At the termination of the feast these trenches should be fully covered in. VIII.- General. 1.     "Prior to feasts and festivals, chuttrums, choultries, and grounds generally resorted to by pilgrims as camping or halting grounds to be put, by district authorities, into good sanitary conditions, and provision made for a pure water supply. The same to be maintained in a good sanitary state till after the dispersion of the pilgrims. 2.     "At the termination of the feast or festival, should cholera have prevailed amongst the people, halting grounds to be ploughed up, and chuttrums and choultries fumigated and white-washed." VI. EPIDEMIC CHOLERA IN JAILS. Epidemic Cholera in Jails. 69. Government had so recently passed orders on the rules to be adopted on the appearance of epidemic diseases in jails, that we are unwil- ling to enter upon any detailed consideration of the subject; but, in accordance with the principle adopted throughout this report, we simply record the "Rules for the guidance of officers in charge of jails on the occurrence of epide- mic diseases," with such modifications as appear to us to be required.
40 Previous proposals on this subject. 70. The original rules were propounded by the Honorable Mr. Ellis and Mr. Rohde, the late Inspector General of Jails, and we re-publish them with certain modifications, omitting entirely some very few passages not bearing upon the immediate subject of our Report, because we believe that they form a code of regulations so complete, that it would be highly undesirable to attempt to summarize them at the risk of the omission of some particulars, which, although apparently unimportant, might, if accidently over- looked, tend to render incomplete the admirable system of conservancy so fully detailed in them. Rules at present in force generally recommended by this Committee. 71. We are further encouraged to reproduce them as containing a very good enumeration of the requirements of sites for cholera camping grounds, and this may prove useful to other departments. We would, however, direct attention to the desirability of providing, at least the prisoners in hospital, with cots, if these be procurable. Quarantine wards in Jails. 72. In submitting these rules, we should also mention that we are aware that objection has been made to the erection of quarantine wards in jails, and we certainly advocate the location of these buildings outside, but we would record our opinion, that unless special wards of this nature be provided, the use of some portions of existing jail buildings for the purpose is highly desirable. We would also note that the period of "observation" proposed in these rules, to be enforced after the occurrence of epidemic disease, is perhaps longer than Observation of new arri- vals. may at first sight appear necessary; but it should be borne in mind that prisoners in jail are especially liable to illus- trate the rapid transmission of contagious disease in conse- quence of the direct and indirect intercommunication which must result from their residence within a limited area from which, under certain circumstances, they pos- sibly may not at any time depart. We are also compelled to bear in mind the heavy expense which must result from their transfer to cholera camps. Certain modifications in existing rules recommended. 73. In the following "Rules," we have made such corrections as seem to us to thoroughly adapt them to the subject of this report. We have removed from the Medical Officer the power pro- posed to be vested in him of exercising discretion as to the removal into camp of prisoners in a jail where cholera has appeared during the height of the monsoon. Identity of requirements of Barracks and Jails as re- gards this disease. 74. We have done so, because we believe that precisely the same rules should pertain here, as in barracks, and consequently we have recommended that, at the discretion of the Medical Officer, the removal of the prisoners from certain particular wards or cells, where the disease has appeared, should be effected. Our observations on the subject with regard to barracks equally apply to jails. Vide para. 52. RULES FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF JAILS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF EPIDEMIC CHOLERA, i. "In many instances Cholera has been introduced into Jails by newly arrived gangs of prisoners and by persons recently committed to Jail. These persons shall be carefully examined before they are admitted into the Jail; and by the Medical
?41 Officer daily, during ten days after admission, and attention shall be paid to their per- sonal cleanliness and to the cleanliness of their clothes. ii. "When prisoners arrive from other Jails, they shall, if Cholera be present among them, not be allowed to enter the Jail before a period of ten days; but be camped at a convenient distance from it, and be detained until reported healthy. iii. "The Officer in charge of such prisoners on the march shall, on the ap- pearance of Cholera, report the same through the Police without loss of time; so that medical assistance and a camp may be in readiness for them on arrival near their desti- nation. iv. "When Cholera has attacked gangs of prisoners, they shall not be admit- ted into Jails until 14 days have elapsed since the last case has appeared, and only then if the prisoners are all healthy. v. "While encamped for this reason, all the rules hereinafter set forth re- garding camps shall be strictly observed both as regards selection of site and camp con- servancy arrangements. vi. "In the event of Cholera being present in the vicinity of a Jail, care must be taken to prevent any communication taking place between the inmates of the Jail and the infected locality, either directly or indirectly. vii. "More than ordinary attention should be paid to all the usual conser- vancy arrangements of the Jail. viii. "Such alterations in the Jail diet as may be calculated to guard pri- soners from liability to the attacks of Cholera shall be adopted on the recommendation of the Medical Officer. ix. "Fires of grass and green wood shall be lighted in the wards and yards daily, so as to purify thoroughly the Jail. x. "The Hospital shall be white-washed, and especial care be taken that all hospital arrangements to meet an outbreak of epidemic disease are complete. xi. "It is the duty of every Officer in charge of the Jail, in communication with the Civil authorities, to have marked out, suitable camping sites for the removal of prisoners on the occurrence of Cholera in the Jail. xii. "It is of essential importance that these sites should be selected for every Jail, and that the selection of sites should not be delayed until the occurrence of epidemic disease. xiii. "Every Officer in charge of a Jail will make a quarterly return to the Inspector-General of Jails, stating whether any change in the selection of sites for such camps has been rendered necessary from any cause soever. xiv. "The requirements of the site of such a camping ground are as follows:- (a.) It should be easy of access and neither to windward or leeward of any Military cantonment, Civil station or Native town, nor within a distance of two miles of such place. (b.) It should not be on the great lines of communication, or thoroughfares, or villages.
?42 (c.) The ground should be high with natural facilities for drainage. (d.) There should be a good supply, if possible, of drinking water. (e.) Rank vegetation is objectionable, and experience has shown that thick topes of trees should be avoided. (f.) The distance of the camping ground from the Jail must depend on local circumstances, but as a rule two or three miles will probably suffice. (g.) The site should be selected with special reference to its state during the rains. (h.) The camping ground should be measured and the number of prisoners with their guards, which it is capable of accommodating, recorded. "To remove doubts which have arisen, as to when Cholera shall be con- sidered to have assumed an epidemic tendency, the following rule is prescribed for the observance of the Medical Officer in charge of the Jail, with whom rests the responsibi- lity of declaring that it has assumed such a degree of epidemic intensity as to render the removal of prisoners necessary. xv. "'If within one week after the first case of Cholera has shown itself in a Jail, three or more cases occur, it shall be considered that the disease has assumed an epidemic form.' xvi. "In the case of epidemic Cholera a portion or the whole body, of prisoners will, at the discretion of the Medical Officer, move into the camp provided for the outbreak of epidemic disease in the Jail, and be located in tents or in tempo- rary huts erected for that purpose. xvii. "The Officer in charge of a Jail at a station at which there is a Camp Equipage Dept shall indent on such dept for a supply of the tents necessary for the accommodation of prisoners, to be moved into camp. xviii. "In like manner Officers in charge of Jails, accessible by Railway, will indent by telegraph on the nearest Camp Equipage Dept for a supply of the tents required. xix. "Provision will be made for supplying tents to Jails, not within easy reach of a Camp Equipage Dept, unless from local circumstances huts can be easily and quickly constructed so as to supply this accommodation for prisoners, instead of tents. xx. Where epidemic disease has broken out in a Jail and it may not be con- sidered desirable to remove all the prisoners into camp, the following precautions will be observed in the Jail during the prevalence of the disease. "The prisoners shall be organized in small gangs for exercise beyond the Jail walls. "Work in factories shall be relaxed, but not entirely discontinued. "The most scrupulous attention shall be paid to the state of the privies. xxi. "Disinfecting and deodorizing agents shall be freely used, such as Mac- Dougall's powder, charcoal, wood-ashes, coal tar and earth, and every precaution con- nected with ' dry earth conservancy' shall be most carefully and continuously enforeed.
43 xxii. "If soiled, the cell floors shall re-made, the walls shall be scoured with a stiff broom, removing from their surface and down from the roof, every particle of dust or animal matter. xxiii. "A wood fire shall be burned in each cell, the doors and windows being temporarily closed. xxiv. "Special attention shall be paid to the boiling and subsequent filtra- tion of all drinking water. xxv. "A portion of the Jail establishment shall be organized as a guard for night work; this guard should go round frequently to the cells, wards, &c., to ascer- tain if any prisoner has been taken ill, and to remove him to the hospital at once. xxvi. "All overcrowding must be strictly avoided, not only in the hospital, but in every cell and ward. xxvii. "During the prevalence of Cholera and Jail Diarrha, slight cases of colic or ordinary diarrha must be treated separately. They shall not be admitted in- to hospital until the characteristic symptoms of Cholera and Jail diarrha have appeared. xxviii. "The hospital floors shall be thickly sprinkled with powdered charcoal, wood-ashes and earth; the dejecta shall be immediately removed, and the wood-ashes and earth swept up and removed when any portion becomes soiled by the discharges. xxix. "The charcoal nets in the hospital shall be increased in number, and the charcoal more frequently re-placed than under ordinary circumstances. xxx. "The same Rules apply to the sleeping cells or wards. xxxi. "The alvine discharges on being removed from the hospital shall be collected outside in an iron pan, with a suitable cover, into which a quantity of Mac- Dougall's disinfecting powder has been thrown, they shall, as frequently as possible, be carried off to the garden trench, which shall, on each occasion, be covered over with six inches of earth. xxxii. "The hospital latrines demand the most scrupulous attention to clean- liness. xxxiii. "The utmost attention to personal cleanliness shall be enforced in the case of every prisoner: small bathing and washing gangs, to be frequently relieved, shall be organized for this purpose. xxxiv. "The hospital clothing, or clothes and bedding used by patients, shall invariably be burnt. xxxv. "It frequently happens that the hospital passage gets saturated with choleraic discharges. A layer of fine sand and ashes a couple of inches thick, should be spread along the passage. This ought to be swept up and removed as often as any portion gets soaked, and fresh sand or ashes strewed in its place. The trench, for the reception of the hospital filth need not be far removed: all that is required is, that the excreta should be constantly covered with sifted earth. xxxvi. "The water in which the prisoners have bathed or washed their clothes shall not be allowed to be thrown within the Jail walls. xxxvii. "Wood fires shall, under due precautionary measures, be kept burning
?44 to the windward and within the Jail enclosure night and day, on the occurrence of any epidemic, in cases where it may not be practicable to remove the prisoners either into another building or into tents. xxxviii. "Attention shall be paid to the diet which should be modified in such a manner as the Medical Officer in charge may consider desirable. xxxix. "When prisoners are moved into camp, dry straw should be procured for the prisoners to sleep on, and cots for the sick. xl. "In camp there should be two detached hospitals, one for the treatment of miscellancous cases and the other for the treatment of epidemic cases. These should be to the leeward of, and some distance from, the camp. xli. "Careful attention should be paid to the conservancy of the camp, and the trenches should be dug every day to the leeward of the position. To these trenches the prisoners and all connected with the camp should be made to go for the purposes of nature. These trenches should be covered over with earth every evening. xlii. "If the disease continues in frequency and virulence for three or four days after the removal of the prisoners, it will be advisable to shift the camping ground." VII. IN HOSPITALS. 75. The precautionary measures to be taken against the extension of Cholera in and its dissemination from Hospitals, as probable foci of infection, are practically the same whether applied to Military or Civil life, and comprise "inter alia:"- (a.) The separation of the sick by Cholera from the general sick, and their isolation, as far as may be possible, by treating them either in separate wards, or in distinct buildings. (b.)    The most rigid enforcement of all acknowledged rules of conservancy. (c.)    The disinfection of the excreta and their immediate removal and burial. (d.)    The destruction of all bedding and clothing used by the sick. (e.)    The disinfection of clothing worn by attendants upon the sick. (f.)    The assignment of special attendants to the sick. 76. The rules given in connection with Section VI, for the guidance of Officers in charge of Jails on the occurrence of Cholera, sufficiently indicate the measures that should be applied to Hospitals. We could however draw attention to the fact that we have struck out the concluding para. of Rule 29, as we dissent from the recommenda- tion therein made of removal from Hospital of "all cases other than Cholera,"--of the conversion in fact of the Hospital into a cholera hospital, which the reading of the rule would imply. 77. The principle of removing the general sick from a Hospital under these circumstances, and of congregating therein all the Cholera cases, we think erroneous, as likely to lead to the impregnation of the building with the cholera germ, to the risk, under favoring conditions, of reproduction of the disease, which is notoriously liable to recurrence in buildings in which it has once established itself. The principle should be, to remove from the Hospital to a detached ward or building
?45 the very first case of Cholera occurring therein: the general sick, that is "all cases other than Cholera," being at the same time removed to other temporary accommo- dation; should such a step be rendered necessary. In fact the rule laid down in the Military Department that any building in which Cholera may manifest itself should be abandoned, should, we think, be applied also in the case of Hospitals. In the event of a case of Cholera occurring in Barracks or Jails, it should be taken at once to a build- ing specially set apart for the treatment of such cases. Provision of Quarantine Hospitals or wards. 78.    We would recommend in fact the establishment of quarantine Hospitals or wards in connection with all stations, Regiments, Jails and Civil Hospitals. These ' quarantine' wards or Hospitals should be located with due regard to acknowledged requirements, necessary to ensure as complete isolation as possible from all other sections of the community. 79.    In Military stations garrisoned by a mixed force of European and Native troops, we would recommend a distinct and separate Cholera Hospital for each class, and every single station: that is every station garrisoned by a single Regiment, should have its quarantine ward attached to its Military Hospital. These quarantine Hospitals or wards might be used for segregation of all cases of contagious disease. 80.     In regard to Jails, the quarantine ward should, we suggest, be outside the Jail walls, so as to guard against the implantation of the Cholera germ within the Jail area. In recommending this extramural position of the quarantine ward in these institutions, we do not desire to interdict the removal of "other than Cholera cases," should it be deemed advisable; and when the first case of the disease occurs, that is, originates in the Hospital, or when one case having been admitted within its walls, other cases occur amongst the general sick, it will be advisable to vacate the Hospital altogether, removing the general sick to other accommodation either within or without the walls of the Jail. 81.     Civil Hospitals and Dispensaries should likewise, we advise, have a separate and detached building for the treatment of Cholera cases. These buildings we further recommend should be temporary rather than permanent, constructed of cheap materials, so as to admit of their being swept away and replaced should such a course, on sanitary grounds, be at any time advisable. Walls of mud or sun-burnt brick, with thatched roofs would, we consider, be the best form of structure, the floors being formed of well rammed clay covered with sand, the latter to be frequently changed, and the former to be broken up and relaid on the cessation of each epidemic visitation of the disease. VIII.   IN SEAPORT TOWNS IN WHICH THE IS DIRECTLY IMPORTED BY SHIPS. 82.    This section opens up the very important question of restrictive mea- sures, under the designation of quarantine. The subject was treated of by the Inter- national Sanitary Conference in five chapters, under the following heads:- I. General considerations on restrictive measures. II. Sanitary cordons, isolation, interruption and restriction of communi- cation,
?46 III.    Teaching of experience on the subject of the isolation of the sources and centres of Cholera. IV.    Cases in which the interruption of communications with infected places is applicable; and, V. The advantages of restraining emigration from infected places, and the means by which this can be attained. 83.    We do not purpose entering into detail upon these subjects; suffice it to say that the conclusions arrived at by the Conference were as follows:-That it is incontestible that quarantine established on rational bases, and in conformity with the progress of science, may serve as an efficacious barrier against the invasion of Cholera and that the measures of prevention should consist in, first, combating the germs of the disease in its primary sources before they disseminate and propagate themselves beyond; and, second, by establishing quarantine in accordance with the principles now admitted, regarding the transmissibility of Cholera, and its mode of propagation. 84.    The measures recommended by the Conference for the enforcement of quarantine, are of the most rigorous nature, including " quarantine of observation," and " rigorous quarantine," the latter involving detention of contaminated, or suspected to be contaminated, ships for a period of ten days, dating from arrival, with the enforce- ment of isolation, disinfection and discharge of all cargo liable to purification-excep- tional precautions being suggested in overcrowded ships, or in vessels on board of which a severe epidemic of the disease has occurred. 85.    The conclusions of the Conference upon this important question-im- portant both in their bearing upon public health and social and commercial intercourse -have not been accepted by a large and influential section of the general and medical intelligence of the country: and quite recently, on the 19th of March of the present year, a Memorial was laid before the Duke of Marlborough, the President of the Privy Council, by a deputation consisting of the President of the College of Physicians, the Director General of the Medical Department of the Navy; Sir W. Jenner, and Drs. Tweedie, Dickenson and Milroy, praying for the appointment of a Royal Com- mission to report upon this subject. The Memorial was signed by numerous gentlemen of high distinction in the ranks of science, amongst whom may be named Dr. Logan, C.B., Director General Army Medical Department, Sir J. Martin, Sir J. Clark, Dr. Sutherland, member of the International Conference on Quarantine, and others. These names are a sufficient guarantee of the dissatisfaction felt with the conclusions of the Constantinople Conference, and the Memorial itself is of sufficient import to justify our quoting it in extenso in our report. MEMORIAL ON QUARANTINE. Addressed to the Lord President of the Privy Council. i. "During the last twenty years the subject of quarantine has, on several occasions, engaged the attention of Government and of the public in this country and on the Continent. ii. "In 1848, on the approach from the East of the second visitation of epidemic
?47 cholera, several of the European governments, as well as our own, refused to re-adopt the rigorous restrictions which had been imposed on freedom of intercourse in the first visitation of the pestilence in 1831-2. These had signally failed as a means of defence, and they bad, moreover, inflicted serious inconvenience and distress, especially upon the poor and working class of the communities. iii. "The General Board of Health in this country presented to Parliament in that year a report recommending the substitution of sanitary precautions in respect of merchant shipping and of maritime ports, for the ordinary quarantine detention of infected or suspected arrivals. iv. "As much difference of opinion continued to prevail throughout Europe respecting the necessity for quarantine, as hitherto carried into effect in regard not only to cholera, but also to yellow fever and the plague,-the three diseases against which it is specially directed-the French Government, in 1850, proposed that an in- ternational conference should be held for the examination of the subject by delegates, medical and consular, from all the leading countries of Europe. v. "The conference, which consisted of twenty-four members, from twelve of the chief states of Europe, was held in Paris in 1851, and continued its sittings for eight months. From the discordance of opinion among the members on various topics which were discussed, the Conference separated without having arrived at unanimous con- clusions on several very important points, and the British Government declined to accede to the report agreed upon by the majority of the delegates. vi. "At the end of 1852, when yellow fever was prevailing in the West Indies, several of the royal mail steamers suffered from attacks of the disease on the voyage from St. Thomas to Southampton, and, in some instances, had cases on board at the time of their arrival. None of the infected vessels were sent to the " Mother Bank" or were detained in quarantine at Southampton for more than two or three days. The healthy passengers and crew were permitted to land, and the sick and convalescent were removed to suitable accommodation on shore. No detriment to the public health appears to have followed, either in Southampton or elsewhere. vii. "On the occasion of the third European epidemic of cholera in 1854-55, quarantine restrictions were almost everywhere suspended in consequence of the war in Turkey and the Crimea. It remains, therefore, to be ascertained whether this sus- pension led to a wider dissemination of the disease, and to a greater mortality from it in Continental countries. viii. "In 1857, in consequence of the outbreak of a malignant fever (which had existed for many weeks before it was officially declared to be the plague), at Benghazi, on the north coast of Africa, between Alexandria and Tunis, freedom of intercommuni- cation throughout the whole of the Mediterranean and the adjoining maritime countries was, for more than two months, interrupted by the quarantine that was generally established. The disease never extended beyond the Arab district, where it broke out, and it speedily ceased upon the adoption of simple hygienic measures among the wretched starving population who were affected. ix. "The outbreak of Cholera at Mecca and other places in Arabia in the early summer of 1865, and the subsequent extension of the pestilence, as the season advanc-
?48 ed, to Egypt and thence to Europe, so strongly impressed the public mind in many Continental countries, that the Emperor of the French deemed it necessary to propose that an international conference should be assembled, with the special view of deter- mining what measures ought to be adopted to prevent, if possible, the recurrrence of a like calamity. The conference-which consisted of twenty-four delegates, medical and diplomatic, representing the chief European states-was held at Constantinople at the beginning of 1866, and continued its sittings throughout that year. x. "The results of the labours of the conference are embodied in a voluminous report which has recently been made public. A rigorous and lengthened quarantine is strongly insisted upon as an indispensable measure for the exclusion of the disease in future; and, for this purpose, it is recommended that a comprehensive scheme of lazarets and of health-police be instituted at every large commercial port in all the maritime countries throughout Europe. "It is manifestly of national importance that the soundness, or otherwise, of these doctrines be duly investigated, as professional opinion both in this country and abroad is known to be far from unanimous on the subject. xi. "At no former time have quarantine restrictions against epidemic cholera been carried into effect, in the south of Europe, with such extreme rigour or to so great an extent, as during the last two years and a half, and there appears to be at the present time a marked disposition generally to the re-institution of more stringent external precautions than have, for many years past, been deemed necessary for the protection of public health. xii. "In the course of the winter of 1866-67, and again during the last few months, restrictive measures have been ordered by the Government in respect of several of the royal mail steamers, arriving at Southampton from the West Indies, so much more rigorous than were adopted, under apparently similar circumstances in 1852-53, that it is most desirable that the public should be made acquainted with the nature of the proceedings which are in future to be taken, and with the reasons for their adoption. xiii. "During last session of Parliament, it was officially declared in the House of Commons that quarantine in this country was resorted to not on medical or public health grounds, but solely on commercial grounds, and to meet the requirements of foreign Governments; by- Lord Robert Montague,  April 4, 1867. ,,       ,,         ,,      May 4,    " Mr. Cave      May 21,  " xiv. "Much of the uncertainty and obscurity which have always surrounded, and which still surround, the quarantine question is owing to the want of authentic evidence as to the working and the results of the system in those places where it has been most rigorously carried into effect. xv. "No committee of either house of the legislature has examined the subject since 1824; and there has been no publication of official correspondence relating to it since 1843-46, with the exception of a short document in 1860 having reference to the practice of quarantine in Turkey.
?49 xvi. "The detailed evidence respecting the practice of quarantine in Malta and Gibraltar during 1865 and 1866, contained in the recently-published reports from the War Office on the visitation of cholera in these colonies, affords a strong argument as to the necessity for a comprehensive investigation of the whole subject. xvii. "No country is so deeply concerned in the right solution of this difficult question of state medicine as Great Britain with her colonies. Besides the magnitude of her commercial relations with every part of the world, the interests of her army and navy, scattered as these are over the face of the globe, and liable to be subjected, by the operation of quarantine regulations, to serious inconveniences, in moving from one place or station to another, demand such an inquiry at the present time. xviii. "It is, moreover, confidently believed that the well-considered expression of opinion by this country, after a searching investigation, could not fail to have great influence with most Continental States, as well as with all our colonies, and would eventually lead to the adoption of a more judicious system of defence against the introduction of foreign disease than is at present generally relied upon. xix. "In view of the above considerations, it is submitted that it is extremely desirable, in the interests of the national welfare, that a thorough examination of the subject of quarantine-in its bearings on public health, commerce, and the military and naval services-should be made by a Royal Commission, which could call for and collect evidence from all suitable sources, and after mature deliberation, might thus be enabled to adopt such practical conclusions as would serve for safe guidance in future." 86. In consideration therefore of the aspect so recently given to this ques- tion, and in the absence of sufficient experience derived and derivable from the history of this Presidency, we refrain from expressing a positive opinion upon the advantages to be derived from, or the necessity that exists for, the imposition of the rigorous mea- sures of quarantine recommended by the Constantinople Conference; but proceed to no- tice, briefly, the measures adopted at the port of Madras, and at other ports in this Pre- sidency, against the importation of cholera by ships arriving from infected localities or in which the disease may have manifested itself at sea. Rules in force at Madras. 87.    At Madras a Medical Officer with the designation of Port and Marine Surgeon, is charged with the duty of visiting all vessels arriv- ing in the " Roads" with troops, and of reporting upon the health of them and the crew before the former are landed, or the latter permitted to hold any communication with the shore. Upon the report of this official, the action of Government is taken. In the event of cholera prevailing amongst the troops or crew, the vessel is ordered to Ennore, about ten miles north of Madras, there to undergo quarantine, and where a Cholera camp is formed, the troops being landed and the camp, as far as possible, isolated and placed under strict observa- tion. The ship and crew are detained till a report is received of the cessation of the disease-ten days being the minimum allowed from the occurrence of the last case of sickness. 88.    The same rules are followed in the case of emigrant ships arriving with return coolies from the Mauritius or elsewhere.
?50 89.     Ennore is well adapted for a quarantine station. It is sufficiently remote from Madras and from any villages; and capable, with little difficulty, of very complete isolation, while the site is open to the sea breeze. 90.    The regulations in force are obviously so judicious, and in a recent instance (the arrival of the ship "Challenge" from Calcutta, with Cholera on board) their enforcement was attended with such satisfactory results, and moreover entailed so little inconvenience upon ship, troops or crew; that in the present aspect of the subject of quarantine in its relation to the prevalence of importation by ships, we would depre- cate any relaxation of them. 91.    In the case of ordinary ships, that is vessels carrying neither troops nor emigrants, the port rules require that the commander, in the event of there being disease on board, shall signalize the same, whereon the Port and Marine Surgeon receives in- structions to visit such ship, and the Master Attendant interdicts any communication between the infected vessel and the shore, or with other ships, till a clean bill of health is granted by the Port Surgeon. We have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servants, W. MACKENZIE, M. D.,   Inspr, Genl. Ind. Medl. Dept.  President.  A. C. SILVER, Colonel.   Cholera Committee. J. L. RANKING,   Members.  Sanitary Commissioner for Madras.
?51 ORDER ON THE REPORT OF THE CHOLERA COMMITTEE. The following Proceedings were recorded by Government in the Public Depart- ment, on the foregoing Report:- ORDER THEREON, 3rd November 1868, No. 1,361 Principal Inspector General, Indian Medical Department. Sanitary Commissioner for Madras. Colonel A. C. Silver. In their Order, No. 216, dated 27th February 1867, the Government requested the Officers marginally noted to form themselves into a Committee for the pur- pose of considering and advising the Go- vernment as to the arrangements which should be made for giving practical effect, in this Presidency, to the recommendations and suggestions of the British Commis- sioners at the International Sanitary Conference held at Constantinople for the prevention of the spread of Cholera. 2.    In the Report above recorded, the Committee submit the result of their inquiries, which is to the effect that it is possible, by the enforcement of regula- tions which they detail, in some instances to prevent the origination, and in others to check the dissemination of Epidemics of Cholera similar to those which have, in past years, been such a fruitful cause of loss of life among Civil and Military com- munities. Taking for their guide the classification of subjects adopted by the Con- stantinople Conference- 1st.-The origin and generation of Cholera, the endemicity and epidemicity of the disease in India; 2nd.-The transmissibility and propagation of Cholera; 3rd.-The prevention of Cholera; the Committee proceeded to obtain and tabulate very valuable information on the two first questions, derived from Returns obtained from every District in the Presi- dency. 3.    The Committee are of opinion that these Returns prove the general accu- racy of the conclusions arrived at by the International Sanitary Conference, and, what is still more important, that it is possible, by adopting the measures suggested by them, to prevent the appearance of Epidemic Cholera during the agglomerations of people which periodically occur in India at the celebration of certain religious Festivals, and during the holding of Fairs. 4.    The Committee further consider that it is clearly established that Cholera may be propagated in an epidemic form from a single case of the disease, by the use of tainted Camping grounds or bad Water, by the contiguity of an infected population, and by the use of tainted carriage and clothing. 5.    They are, however, unable to support the theory advanced by the Con- stantinople Conference of the endemicity of the disease in certain places. The result of their inquiry is that, contrary to the prevalent opinion, there is no proof that Cholera is endemic in any place in the Madras Presidency, and that the great preponderance of evidence goes to prove that epidemics of Cholera in Cities and Dis- tricts are distinctly attributable, in almost every instance, to the importation of the disease in an epidemic form by Pilgrims, ordinary travellers or troops while on the march.
?52 6.    In so far as the conclusions of the Committee are correct, the prevention of out-breaks of Cholera and their spread must depend upon Sanitary precautions to be adopted whenever there are large assemblages of human beings, and by prevent- ing infected individuals and localities from communication with healthy places. 7.    The Government have already in the G. O., dated 27th April 1868, No. 518, recorded their concurrence in the opinions of the Committee, as expressed in their Report " On the Control of Pilgrimages," and have recommended to the Go- vernment of India that there should be Special Legislation on this subject. 8.    The recommendations of the Committee as to the administrative action required, other than in connexion with Pilgrimages, are divided under the following headings, which embrace the measures of sanitation for the prevention and check of Epidemic Cholera:- I.-In Cities, Towns, and Villages. II.-In Military Cantonments. III.-Among European and among Native Troops on the march. IV.-The management and conservancy of Fairs and Festivals. V.-In Jails. VI.-In Hospitals. VII.-In Sea-port Towns in which the disease is directly imported by Ships. 9.    It is a satisfaction to the Government to find that nearly all the principal measures which the Committee recommend under these headings have, during the last few years, been adopted in this Presidency, and that all that is necessary at present is to impress upon the Municipalities throughout the country, and on the several Departments of the State, the importance of the strictest observance of pre- cautions, the utility of which is confirmed by every scientific inquiry which has hitherto been made, and which is further supported by the valuable information and reasoning contained in the Committee's Report. 10.    The Government desire to tender to the Committee their thanks for the valuable report which they have submitted, and resolve that copies of the report be forwarded to all Presidents of Municipalities in the Presidency, to the Military De- partment for communication to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, to the Inspector General of Jails, and to the Inspectors General of the British and Indian Medical Services. 11.    The question of the necessary measures to be adopted in the cases of ves- sels with Cholera on board, and the places at which passengers from infected vessels should be landed and kept for a brief period under observation, are under the consi- deration of Government. A copy of these Proceedings, and of the Committee's Report, will be submitted to the Government of India. (True Extract.) (Signed) R. S. ELLIS, Chief Secretary.
