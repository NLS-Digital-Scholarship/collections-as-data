TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGES. Report on the working of the Micro-Biological Section by Dr. F.M. Gibson, M.B., B.Sc., Acting Director 1 Progress note on Proto-Zoological Investigation by Captain W. S. Patton, I.M.S., Assistant Director 2 Vaccine Therapy 4 PARTS I AND II OF APPENDIX IREPORT UPON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 1909. THE present report only deals with nine months, the previous report having covered the first quarter of 1909 as well as 1908. On his return from leave on August 19th, Captain W. S. Patton, I.M.S., was posted to the Institute as Assistant Director. On the same date Military Assist- ant Surgeon H. C. Jackson, till then Deputy Superintendent, proceeded on combined leave. During the period under report the systematic examination of the water- supplies of the Presidency, initiated by Major Clemesha, I.M.S., has been con- tinued. Each water-supply is examined once a quarter. In addition, the systematic examination of the Presidency jails' water-supplies has been started, these being examined half-yearly. The results of these examinations are printed as appendices to this report, those dealing with the jail supplies forming appendix No. 1, parts I and II, those dealing with municipal supplies forming appendix. No. 2, parts I, II and III. This work has absorbed a very large proportion of the working capacity of the staff, and has constituted in fact the bulk of the routine work. During the last two quarters of the year more prominence has been given to the classifying of the bacteria found in drinking-water according to their power of withstanding the natural purifying agencies of sunlight and oxidation. It will be noticed that there are many organisms occurring in drinking-water, whose position in this respect is still undetermined. More work is required in this direction and will he put in hand, as soon as there is reasonable certainty of prolonged steady sunshine. As noted last year, the classifying of germs according to their fermentative reactions in different sugars is purely artificial, useful as a means of differentiation, but of little farther practical Value. Some time must elapse before conclusions based on this work, can be expressed with any degree of certainty; in the meantime, how- ever, some benefit appears to have resulted from the attention drawn to various points in the management of water-works. Captain Patton, the Assistant Director, has, in addition to his routine work in the Vaccine Section, been almost entirely engaged on protozoological work, a short account of which is included in this report. The large number of calves that are passed through the Institute furnishes a good opportunity of determining the inci- dence of protozoal disease in these animals. The blood of over a thousand of them has been examined up to date, and a Very large proportion are found to be infected with a parasite belonging to the genus Theileria. This parasite seems to have little pathogenicity for cattle. It is quite otherwise with regard to Piroplasma bigeminum. Here the small percentage of calves which are found to harbour the parasite represent the animals which have recovered from the disease, i.e., are, salted, and correspond to a much larger number that have succumbed. Practically, all the calves that acquire this form of piroplasmosis at the Institute die. The discovery of an hitherto undescribed piroplasm, pathogenic to hounds and derived
2 from the jackal will be of interest, albeit melancholy interest, to sportsmen. Captain Patton's work on Herpetomonas musc3 Canine piroplasmosis.4 A preliminary paper recording the results already obtained in the case of Herpetomonas muse5 is that there is an enteric or other history in connection with the patient, and it is for the clinician to determine whether the present or a past condition is responsible for the reaction. Vice versâ When the reaction reported is a negative one, that is not tantamount to saying that the patient has not got typhoid or other fever. There is also some difference of opinion as to what constitutes a positive reaction. Bearing in mind the above-mentioned limitations as to what is meant by a positive reaction, I consider that it is better to report an action positive if there is a reasonable amount of agglutination in a dilution of one in thirty in half an hour. A positive report can only lead to greater vigilance, while a negative one might mislead the medical attendant to the detriment of the patient. If, however, as maintained by some authorities, you can only regard a reaction as positive when it is complete at a dilution of one in thirty in fifteen minutes, and marked at one in a hundred in half an hour, you must exclude all those incipient reactions which are sometimes the first guiding clue that a physician has in a puzzling case. Further it is just in the ill-defined cases that most help is required. Since the 15th of Sep- tember in addition to the report at dilution one in thirty-two, the reaction at one in a hundred after one hour has been given. Two hundred and ninety-two tests were made and of these 142 gave a positive reaction to enteric germs. Thirty-three of these were tested up to a dilution of one in a hundred and 25 reacted positively at that dilution. Out of 16 tests for Paratyphoid. B., 8 were positive, and out of these 8, 6 also reacted to enteric germs. Fifteen tests against B. Gärtner euteritidis gave only one positive reaction, while of 7 tests against Paratyphoid A., and 6 against Micrococcus melitensis, all were negative. (4) Malaria.6 Fresh films give the best results, but even after twenty-four hours only the ghosts of the red blood corpuscles can be made out and the trypanosomes can be readily detected under the low power. The procedure would be both convenient and efficient when examining for trypanosomes or filaria in cases where the infections are not heavy.

9 GENERAL REMARKS ON THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE EXAMINATION OF JAIL WATER-SUPPLIES. Bacteriological Results.10 is washed directly into these surface wells, and therefore such wells cannot be looked upon as being anything but extremely doubtful and suspicious sources of drinking water. It must be understood that it is not maintained that the water in these wells is always as polluted as would appear from these analyses. Periods of improvement during drought will fairly certainly occur, but the dangerous factor is that normal meteorological conditions can cause serious pollution and undoubtedly, for the time being, render a drinking-water entirely unfit for human consumption. In some of the jails I have inspected, particularly in Vellore and Rajahmundry, latrines and other sources of pollution of the ground exist in much too great proximity to the drinking- water well and in all probability these constitute a regular source of pollution of the ground, which pollution (having regard to the porosity of the soil) finds its way into the subsoil supply. It will be observed that from both the wells described as satisfactory (viz., those at Cannanore and Coimbatore) a rock water is obtained; in the case of Cannanore from the laterite and in the case of Coimbatore probably from a deep supply. From all the others surface water is obtained; hence the great difference in quality. It should also be stated here that most of the wells in the jails are structurally perfect and are well looked after. The chances of outside pollution gaining access through the well mouth are not great, consequently it is certain that the source of supply is really at fault. 2.Chemical Analysis.11 namely, that during the whole of the night12 a water-supply which is absolutely above suspicion, the disease spreads in spite of the best endeavours of the medical authorities to stamp it out. I consider that the whole of the routine for giving meals and for the storage of food and drink utensils in our jails, should be revised as I am perfectly certain that it is at present a possible factor in the spread of infectious diseases. I do not consider that it is within my province to make a detailed recommendation, but leave the actual details to be worked out by the jail authorities. I may just mention however, that in Bengal and Northern India, cheap steel utensils are provided which are not open to the same objection as the pots used in this country. W. W.

28 CENTRAL JAIL, RAJAHMUNDRY. SAMPLES TAKEN29 Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE No. I.30 INSPECTION REPORT. Whilst on other inspection duty in Rajahmundry I inspected the water-supply arrange- ments of the jail. The analyses will show that the quality of the well water is very bad on the whole, but that the sample taken from the service reservoir was considerably worse than that taken from the well. I carefully examined the well for cracks in the masonry. A large number of roots of trees have penetrated the stone, but it does not appear that there is any leakage of surface water into the well at these points. Consequently one is forced to believe that the water is actually polluted some distance away from the well. The chemical analyses suggest that the pollution is of fairly old standing and the. poro- sity of the soil would account for the number of f31 DISTRICT JAIL, BERHAMPUR.

The sample taken from the well shows f&#339;cal organism in 1 cc., the organism being those found in wells in hot weather. Chemically the water from the gallery and the well are good, but both are very hard. The recent rains probably have caused a temporary deterioration in the quality of the water.

The sample taken from the lake contains very large number of organisms, namely, 100 per cc. The organisms however show that the water has been throughly well sunned. The sample taken from the filtered reservoir shows for the first time that the filter beds are considerably improving the quality of the water. Further improvement has gone on in the pipes so that the water from the hydrant is of good quality and contains only one organism in 20 or 30 cc. Chemically the water is not a good one, both ammonia figures being extremely high and both being considerably increased by the action of the filters. Explanation for this phenomena is not apparent.

113 NOTE. With the quarter presently under report we commence the second year during which systematic analyses of the piped water-supplies in the Madras Presidency have been carried out. It will therefore be of interest to draw up a short compara- tive synopsis of the conditions prevailing and of the results found now, and in the corresponding quarter of last year.

Organisms of animal origin, are found in 5 cc. of the water, but the nature of these only indicates old-standing pollution, and that a considerable degree of natural purification has taken place. The unfiltered water of the service reservoir is not of such good quality as that of the storage reservoir, and it would appear that surface pollution, either en route to or directly into the service reservoir, has not been entirely eliminated. The samples drawn from the distributary system yield results conforming with the above. The water might be better, but has no specially objectionable features. Chemically the water is satisfactory and possesses all the characteristics of a good hill water.

On the whole the results obtained from this quarter's analyses can be regarded with some satisfaction. The total count of microbes per cc. is far too high in the unfiltered water, but this is probably due to the heavy rainfall. The very small proportion of microbes of animal origin shows that the gathering ground is clean. In the filtered water the total count of organisms is also very high, and this seems due to the post filtration passages being foul. That the filters are moderately good may be seen from the fact that the excremental microbes have been reduced by eighty per cent. The samples taken from the more distant parts of the distributary system show reduced numbers for the total counts though none of them are what can be called good in this respect. There is no very obvious explanation for the varying quality and quantity of the microbes found in the water from different parts of the system. There are too many varieties in the waters taken from the taps near the filter beds and near the harbour. The east- ern tap near the beach yields the best water from this point of view, as there is pratically only one variety, and that of the most resistent kind. On previous occasions the water from the tap in the railway compound was worse than the others, and it alone on this occasion shows all the varieties of microbes examined belonging to the more susceptible class II158 COCANADA.

Considering the very considerable rainfall that has taken place since the water was last examined, it is not very surprising to find evidence of extensive pollution in the samples taken on the 27th September. There is in the water taken from the Samalkota canal a very large total count and excremental microbes in one hundredth of a cc. These latter also show a con- siderable variety of species which farther confirms the extensive nature of the pollution, but the species present show that the recent and dangerous pollution has probably been washed away leaving the gathering grounds harmless if not so clean as they might be. The results got with sample II, taken from the storage tank show what a very valuable measure storage is The excremental germs have been reduced a hundred fold and the total count is also much lower. Sample III shows that filtration has not improved the water. The variety of f161 Tabular Statement of Chemical Analyses. [Parts per 100,000.] Name of Place. Colour and transparency. Total solids.

The condition of flood in which the river Cauvery was at the time the samples were taken precludes the possibility of the water showing good results. The total number of microbes was so large as to be uncountable, and it is therefore gratifying that the organisms of animal origin are so few as one in a cc. Probably all the more objectionable kinds also had been washed away at the time, but of this we cannot be quite certain as a large proportion of the varieties found belonged to species whose resistance to natural purifying agencies has not been determined. Still none of the better-known varieties usually associated with recent objectionable pollution was found. Passage through the infiltration gallery produced a very marked change in the bacterial content of the water. The total count is still far too high, but the excremental microbes are greatly reduced in number and are practically confined to one species. This species was not however represented in the river water, so it has probably been derived from the gallery and conducting channels. This idea is borne out by the results shown on examining Sample III from the distributary system. Here we find the same germ in preponderating and greatly increased amount. There must be a good deal of deposit in the pipes to account for this. Sample IV is quantitatively very like Sample III, but there has been a complete change in the varieties present. These changes in different parts of the same distributary system are difficult to account for. Probably silt has a good deal to do with them but why the deposit should be different in the different pipes is not quite so clear. Chemically the water is excellent. 43

REPORT. In respect to the purity of its water-supply Madura evidently leads a very up and down existence, and at the time these samples were taken down and very much so was the order of the day. The water could hardly be worse. At this season last year and under very similar con- ditions, that is with a small stream of water in the Vaigai river, the state of affairs was very different. Then as always the river water was bad, but the water taken from the distributary system was so good as to give rise to the conjecture that the subsoil water and not the river was the real source of supply. On the present occasion some support is given to this idea by the result of the chemical analyses, those obtained from the river and supply water respectively being very different, and in a sense not likely to have been brought about by simple filtration. Chemically the supply water is much the better, but bacteriologically it shows signs of even more recent pollution than the river water. If it be really subsoil water that is being pumped from the in- filtration gallery, then the subsoil water is liable to serious and what might at any time become dangerous pollution. A drinking-water supply, that without any obvious cause, shows the presence of oxytoccus perniciosus and coli communis can only be regarded with the gravest sus- picion, and if any other supply be available it should be investigated in order to see if something more satisfactory cannot be got. The huge total count of microbes in the sample drawn from the tap in Block No. 1, Railway Station road, Mungammal Chattram points to a dirty condition of the pipes. All the samples, river and supply water alike show the presence of the susceptible microbes of class I, indicative of recent pollution, and the number of species present shows that the pollution in addition to being recent and objectionable is extensive. 44

In this quarter the water-supply has been derived from both sources, the infiltration gallery and the deep well, and as was found on previous occasions the latter source of supply proves to be very inferior to the former. The water from the infiltration gallery shows a very high total count of microbes and contains excremental germs in as small a quantity as one-tenth of a cc. The varieties of f176 CONJEEVERAM.

The heavy rainfall has however had the effect of cleansing up the catchment area, so that a satisfactory report on the condition of the water is possible. The water of the river contains 330 germs to the cc. and foecal bacilli in 1 cc. This is above the general average of rivers in quality, and though a considerable number of varieties are repre- sented among the excremental organisms, this is no more than was to be expected taking the heavy rainfall into consideration. The filtered water from the suction well shows a marked improvement. The total count has been reduced, and that most markedly among the germs of animal origin, which are now only one-tenth as numerous as in the unfiltered water, and are represented by a single species of an unobjectionable kind. As this species is not present in the unfiltered water it indicates that the filters are working efficiently, and have probably removed nearly all of the germs originally present in the water, those subsequently present being derived. from the post-filtration passages. The samples from the distributary system show an equally or more gratifying scarcity of animal organisms, but the large increases in the total counts point to a considerable accumulation of silt in the pipes. Chemically the water is fair originally and has been improved up to a quite satisfactory standard by filtration.

Considering that the Bugga river was partially flooded when these samples were taken, it is rather surprising to get such good results. The river water with a total count of 780 per cc. and only one organism of animal origin in five cubic centimetres is distinctly good. After passage through the infiltration gallery the animal organisms are slightly reduced, but the total count is largely increased, so that it cannot be said that improvement has resulted. The filtra- tion gallery and passages are probably dirty. The sample from a tap in Yerramukkupalli is like that of the original river water but with a rather higher total count. The sample drawn in the Geddy bazaar road shows the worst results having a total count of close on three thousand, with fæcal germs in as little as one cc. These must have been derived from the pipes, as the few varieties present in any of the samples seems to preclude the idea of surface pollution leaking. into the pipes. In all the samples the nature of the germs present shows that a considerable. amount of natural purification has gone on in the water. Chemically the water is excellent.

Considered in relation to the possible presence of pollution derived from the dejecta of men or other animals, the results obtained on analysis of the Vellore water-supply on this occasion are extremely satisfactory, and the water must be classed as very good indeed. The unfiltered water from the tank shows no lactose fermenters in less than 60 cc. of water. Bacteriologically the water is not improved. by filtration though the filtered water is still quite good as regards the number of lactose fermenters. There is, however, a very marked rise in the; total count which is increased to an even greater extent in the water drawn from a tap in Saidapet. This shows that the post filtration passages are dirty and that the pipes would be the better of being scoured out. The sample drawn from a tap in the westernmost corner of the Cantonment station compound, though still good, is the least satisfactory of the four. In this sample there were f205 GUDIYATTAM.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE MICRO- BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, MADRAS, FOR THE YEAR 1910 (WITH APPENDICES) MADRAS: PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRESS. 1911. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of 74920484.tif]
TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGES Report on the working of the Micro-Biological section by Dr, F. M. Gibson, M.B., B.Sc., Director 1 Vaccine Therapy 6 PARTS I AND II OF APPENDIX IREPORT ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT IN THE MICRO-BIOLOGICAL. SECTION OF THE KING INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, GUINDY, FOR THE YEAR 1910. FOR the first half of the year under report there was no change in the staff, but early in June Captain W. S. Patton, I.M.S., the Assistant Director, was placed on special deputation work to investigate the life history of the parasite causing " Oriental Sore ". By means of this investigation it is hoped to clear up some of the points in the life history of the closely related parasite of Kala-Azar and the means by which this disease is transmitted. Kala-Azar being a fatal disease and one, so far as we are aware, that is confined to human beings, it is impossible to reproduce it experimentally. Captain Patton's work is still in progress and will form the subject of a special memoir. No officer was appointed to carry on Captain Patton's work in so far as. it was connected with the Micro-Biological Section of the Institute. In July, V. Govindaraju. Mudaliyar, B.A., Junior Laboratory Assistant, was transferred to Bengal, and his place was filled by R. Venkatakrishna Mudaliyar, B.A. The year has been an exceedingly busy one for the section. In all directions the volume of routine work has increased and several new branches of work have been started. For sometime back it has been evident that the accommodation in the existing building of the section was inadequate even for existing requirements, and that the increase of work bound to come in the future as the functions and the advantages offered by the laboratory became more widely known, and as fresh problems requir- ing solution arose, would necessitate the provision of extra accommodation and staff. Early in the year detailed plans for large additions to the present building, and for practically the entire re-equipment of the section, were submitted to Government, and these have received administrative sanction. During the year the systematic examination of the water-supplies of the Presidency was continued. Each town supply was examined once a quarter, and each jail supply twice a year. In addition a considerable number of samples were examined for private persons or firms and a further considerable number for the Sanitary Engineer to Government in connection with the institution of new supplies. As was the case last year more stress was laid on the classification of micro- organisms in groups or classes according to their powers of resistance to natural purifying agencies than into the more or less artificial groups depending on their behaviour to sugars or other chemicals. Owing to the increasing amount of work that had to be dealt with in other directions, it was unfortunately impossible to find time for farther experiments on the subject of relative resisting power. There still remains therefore a considerable gap in our knowledge on this point. More than a third of the samples examined show the presence of organisms whose powers of resistance have not been determined. Probably however comparatively few species
ii are involved, and. it must also be borne in mind that undetermined species are most likely to belong to the classes that are prevalent in the particular water. That is to say that the great majority of undetermined species are likely to belong to the less objectionable classes, as only a few of the samples examined show the presence of microbes of the dangerous class I type. There seems also to be a reduced tendency for undetermined species to occur in the same sample with organisms of class I During the first half of the year organisms belonging to class I were found in thirty samples but in only six of these, or one-fifth of the number, were species, whose resisting power had not been determined, also found. As pointed out above the proportion of all samples showing the presence of germs of this kind is more than a third. Altogether 509 complete bacteriological and 365 complete chemical examinations of water were made in the course of the year. The results of the routine examina- tions are printed as appendices to this report, those dealing with the jail supplies forming appendix 1, Parts I and II, and those dealing with town supplies forming appendix No. 2, Parts I, II, III and IV. There has been a rise in the number of specimens sent to the Institute for examination and report. In table No. I these are arranged to show the nature of the material and the examination required, the result positive or negative, and the total. TABLE I. Description of specimens.

This organism was got in various situation on the head, neck and back from immature pustules such as had not gone on to visible suppuration. It is hardly likely therefore that its presence in the pustules was purely accidental and without significance. It was often associated with an atypical Staphylococcus albus.

33 INTRODUCTORY NOTES COMPARING THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS OBTAINED DURING THIS QUARTER WITH THOSE OF THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF 1909. Trichinopoly.34 Guntúr.35 TRICHINOPOLY. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN36 REPORT. The river Cauvery being partially flooded a high degree of bacterial purity in its water is not to be expected. Still it is not bad. The total count is high, but a very small proportion of the germs are of animal origin. The small number of species present indicates that a considerable amount of natural purification has taken place in the water. The water is in fact very like what it was on the last occasion. This time, however, the water after filtration is not so good. There is a marked reduction in the total count which would point to the filtration being effective to a certain degree. Presumably filtration removes all classes of germs ordinarily studied in water to an equal extent, so we must suppose that three-fourths of the f37 TANJORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN38 REPORT. The river water shows all the features expected in times of flood. There are a great number of organisms, only a small proportion of these or of animal origin, and these latter are of the more resistant varieties. A considerable reduction in numbers has taken place in consequence of filtration, but a large number of new species have been added to the f39 CUDDAPAH. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN40 REPORT. This quarter the river water is not quite so good as last, but still there is not very much to complain about. With one f41 ADÓNI WATER SAMPLES TAKEN42 SAMPLE IV. 43 CONJEEVERAM. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN44 REPORT. The analytical history of the Conjeeveram water-supply is a fairly consistent one. We have seen on most occasions that the river water is subject to pollution which may be quite extensive, but that filtration and passage through the distributary pipes have resulted in very marked improvement. These conditions hold good on the present occasion. The river water is greatly polluted, and although the pollution is not recent and dangerous, it is a pity that more cannot be done to prevent this. The water from the suction well and from the distributary system is very much better and can be regarded as very fairly satisfactory. Chemically an almost constant feature has been the improvement in this water by filtration. This improvement is probably not so much due to filtration as to admixture with a purer water derived from the deeper layers of the river bed. The very high figure for free ammonia in the river water is probably accidental. The water from the suction well is quite satisfactory. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances.

85 MADRAS MUNICIPALITY. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN86 REPORT. The results got this quarter on analysis of the Madras Water Supply are rather instructive. For the first time since these systematic analyses were started the Sholavaram channel was dry. A sample was got, however, from a small pool in the bed of the channel. Under such circumstances a high degree of bacterial purity could hardly be expected and as a matter of fact we get evidence of pretty extensive pollution. There are none of the most susceptible kinds of micro-organisms present, but there is an astonishing number of species. This is rather an unusual feature during dry weather. It is, however, in the chemical results that we see the most striking changes. The water is much softer, it contains much less saline impurity, the organic matter is getting oxidised, and though still largely of animal origin the more resistant vegetable matter is proportionately increasing. This suggests that most of the objectionable chemical features usually present are derived from polluted surface washings and are therefore preventible. Bacteriologically the water of the Red Hills Lake is in very good order. The water from the bottom shows the marked improvement expected from sunning and sedimentation, the fæcal organisms being few in number and practically only one of the most resistant kind represented. The surface water contains even fewer fæcal germs and in fact this is the smallest number of these germs ever found in the lake water, It is curious therefore to find a species of the most susceptible class present. I cannot but think that their presence is due to dust; and as extensive and dangerous pollution is hardly likely to get access to the water in this way, they are probably not of much account on this occasion. The samples from the distributary system show quite satisfactory results. The water at Saidapet Toll Gate has been better, but it has been much worse. This time the water from Georgetown is better than on any previous occasion. Chemically the water is not very good. It contains a good deal of chlorine, and the organic matter is too plentiful and probably all of animal origin. Chemically the water of the Sholavaram system appears to be the worst, and on this occasion it was not getting into the lake. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE III. Physical appearances.

WATER SAMPLES TAKEN90 pipes for long, so we are driven to the conclusion that this highly objectionable form of pollution is leaking from the outside, a supposition that gains support from the fact that the supply is intermittent. The pipes should be carefully overhauled for possible leaks. Chemically the water is on the hard side but is otherwise fair. The water from the distributary system is considerably better than the raw river water, but the organic matter it contains is more definitely of animal origin. Taken along with the results obtained on bacteriological examination this again points to leakage into the pipes. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE III. Physical appearances.

125 INTRODUCTORY NOTE. With the quarter presently under report we commence the third year during which systematic analyses of the pipes water supplies in the Madras Presidency have been carried out. Varying meteorological conditions will doubtless give rise to varying results with the same water-supply at corresponding parts of the three years, but in time the variations due to this cause will disappear and it may then be possible to define what is attainable by good management, and to fix standards. of purity applicable to this part of India. Trichinopoly.126 Chemically it is always inferior to the others. Better conservation may be expected to do much, and should entirely do away with the fluctuating results got with the water from the other sources. Madura.127 germs many times and usually increasing the total count. The results fr&#972;m the distributary system are variable. It would be desirable to give a continuous supply at this season when there is plenty of water, to test whether the pipes are at fault or whether it is simply a tendency for silt to collect. Chemically there is too much organic matter which appears to be mainly of animal origin, but otherwise the water is fairly good and soft. Vizagapatam.128 TRICHINOPOLY.

On this occasion the Cuddapah water is bacteriologically exceedingly bad.

With a total count of 170 germs to the cc., and only one in 34 of these of animal origin, and the latter again represented by only a few species the water of the service reservoir must be classed as distinctly good. The samples drawn from the distributary system do not show quite such satisfactory results. Sample II shows a considerable increase in the f142 COONOOR. SAMPLES TAKEN143 REPORT. The results on this occasion show a reversal from the usual in respect of the storage and service reservoirs, the latter being considerably better, and really in a very satisfactory condition. Is there any reason why this state of affairs, in regard to the service reservoir of course, should not be maintained. The water of the storage reservoir is not nearly so good as it has been, but this may be associated with recent rainy weather. There are ten f144 OOTACAMUND.

WATER SAMPLES TAKEN166 SAMPLE V.167 VIZAGAPATAM. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN168 REPORT. The water of the lake on this occasion shows a very usual state of affairs, not very good, not very bad. The total count is high bat only a very small proportion of the micro-organisms are of excremental origin. The filtered water is worse in both respects. The samples drawn from the distributary system are again more satisfactory, probably due to sedimentation in the long length of pipe line. Chemically the water is good but there is a good deal of vegetable organic matter in it. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV. Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency. White and opaque.

173 INTRODUCTORY NOTE. Trichinopoly.174 Coonoor.175 Ootacamund.176 TRICHINOPOLY WATER SAMPLES TAKEN&#8722;&#8722;4TH OCTOBER 1910. REMARKS.177 REPORT. As at this season last year the Cauvery was in flood when the samples were drawn so it is not surprising to find that there are a large number of organisms in the water. The more susceptible ones however have disappeared, and though there are too many species present, anything else was hardly to be expected. Although the total count has been largely reduced by a passage through the infiltration gallery, the improvement is more apparent than real as the f178 TANJORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN179 REPORT. Considering the high flood that there was in the river when the samples were drawn it is surprising to find so few f180 MADRAS. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN181 SAMPLE V.182 Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I.

191 COONOOR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN192 REPORT. The storage reservoir is still described as full and overflowing, but on this occasion the water is much better than when last examined. This would seem to point to the catchment area getting cleansed by the prolonged rainfall. Whatever the cause the water is in quite a satisfactory condition. The water taken from a tap adjoining the service reservoir shows a reversion to the old unsatisfactory state of affairs. It shows a tenfold number of f193 DINDIGUL.

195 MADURA. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN196 REPORT. Not much was to be expected from the water of the river Vaigai on this occasion the river being in floods, and we are therefore not surprised to note a large total count, large total solids, which are mainly in suspension however and one hundred f197 NELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN198 REPORT. Passage through the infiltration gallery at Nellore usually results in a considerable improvement of the water and this occasion forms no exception to the rule. The river being in flood we naturally expect to find the water polluted but the pollution is moderate in amount and the kind shows that the most objectionable germs have been got rid of. Sample II shows a very marked improvement and the water at this point may be considered quite satis- factory. It is very much otherwise with Sample III.

213 VIZAGAPATAM. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN214 REPORT. Vizagapatam is to be congratulated on the condition of its water-supply on this occasion. These results are much the best that have been obtained since the supply was systematically examined, and it would be well if the conditions in force when the samples were taken could be noted down for future guidance. There is really hardly a point to take exception to. The water of the reservoir is remarkably pure and we cannot complain about the small number of micro-organisms in it or the relatively high figure for organic matter as they only serve to show how efficiently the filters are working. The total counts in all the filtered samples have almost been reduced to the vanishing point and only one species of intestinal germ was isolated from the wholeset. Chemically the figure for chlorine is high but this stands in no relation to the figures for organic matter, so must be of mineral origin. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I. SAMPLE IV.

There were several changes in the staff of the section this year. Owing to the increasing demand for therapeutic vaccines the work of preparing these began to grow beyond the resources of the staff, and the sanction of Govern- ment was obtained to the strengthening of the staff by an officer who should devote his time to this branch of work. The officer selected was Civil Assistant Surgeon. M. Kesava Pai, M.D., who joined on the 27th March 1911. On the 14th of April, the Director, Dr. F. Maitland Gibson, proceeded to England on combined leave, and Captain W. S. Patton, I.M.S., was gazette to the acting appointment, which he held during the remainder of the year under report. On the 24th of June 1911, Captain F. W. Cragg, I.M.S., joined the Institute in the capacity of Acting Assistant Director, which post he was still holding at the end of the year. A great deal of work has been carried through in the section. Captain Patton continued his investigation on the etiology of Oriental Sore or Cambay Boil, and with the experience gained in this investigation has been able to advance a stage farther in the corresponding experiments with the parasite of Kala-Azar. Captain Patton has furnished a short abstract of this interesting work for incorporation in this report. A new feature is furnished by the work of Captain Cragg on the structure of the proboscis of Philaematomyia insignis, a short account of which is given later. This work throws an interesting light on the structural alterations which take place in flies as they assume a parasitic habit. The systematic examination of the water-supplies of the Presidency was continued on the same lines as last year. An even larger number of samples were examined, and the rise in the number of chemical examinations amounted to seven- teen per cent. As in previous years these results are printed in the form of appendices to this report. The results got with Jail waters forming Appendix I, Parts 1 and 2, and those got with Municipal water-supplies Appendix II, Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4. Some scepticism has been expressed as to the practical value of these examinations. As opportunity offers a critical analysis will be made of the results so for obtained, with the view of showing whether this scepticism is justified. Very varying results are reported from different countries in. the tropics, and it has been questioned whether it is practicable to formulate standards of purity for tropical water-supplies. There has been a drop of 11ii TABLE I. Serial number. Description of specimens. Number of positive results. Number of negative results. Total.

2 TABLE IIvi It will be noticed that the percentage of cases in which the organism was found is exactly the same as last year. This percentage may therefore be regarded as closely approximating to that in which it is possible to demonstrate the organism, but this does not exclude syphilis as a possible cause of many of the cases in which the germ could not be found. How unreliable the elicited history of the parents may be can be gauged from the fact that no syphilitic history was ascertained in thirteen out of fifteen cases in which the germ was demonstrated. In both cases in which syphilis was admitted, the father had suffered from the disease and the history as regards previous pregnancies is very typical. That a negative find does not exclude syphilis as the probable cause is well shown by case No. 36. Here a syphilitic history in both parents was elicited., but the organism could not be demonstrated. This failure may, as stated last year, be due to putrefactive changes having set in before the examination could be made. In spite of no syphilitic history having been elicited, cases Nos.16, 19, 23, 38 and 55 in which the organism was found give histories very typical of syphilis with respect to previous pregnancies. The reverse, however, is found in Nos. 6, 20, 28, 31, 39, 43, 44 and 47 where the positive finds of the organism are not associated with histories typical of syphilis at previous pregnancies. Possibly in these latter we have to do with a more recent infection; but such want of concordance between the microscopical find and the history as elicited, both in respect of syphilis itself and of what may be called typical of syphilis, would appear to negative the assumption made last year that syphilis might be the sole cause of the condition. Without exception when spirochætes have been demonstrated, they have been seen in the liver, next in order of frequency comes the kidney. They have never been seen in the brain, epiphyses or placenta. The brain is almost always in a diffluent condition, so the non-occurrence of the germ there is hardly surprising. It would probably suffice for the purposes of this investigation if the liver only were examined. WORK CARRIED OUT BY CAPTAIN PATTON,I.M.S., DURING THE YEAR 1911. The etiology of Oriental Sore.vii of those people who came to Cambay for short periods were infected during the cold weather. Bugs were then kept in a tin box surrounded with ice and in one bug dissected shortly after- wards the flagellate stage was recovered. The experiments were continued in Cambay and later in Madras, and it has been definitely settled that the parasite will only flagellate in the bug below a certain temperature (72° F.-75°F.), but that it dies out in the adult bug. Further experiments are now in progress with the nymphal stage of the bug to try and see whether the parasite will complete its development in one or other of the nymphal instars. The etiology of Kala-Azar.Viii of the discal sclerite in Musca. These rods are themselves articulated on to the end of the anterior sclerite of the labium, which is so greatly increased in thickness and solidarity as to constitute the strongest part of the haustellum; the labellar rods are articulated to this sclerite, which may be called the labial gutter, by their middle portions and are free to move in an anterior and posterior plane, carrying the teeth with them in all their movements. The teeth when the proboscis is in a position of rest are folded opposite to one another, with their serrated edges turned outwards and their apices pointing downwards; they can be brought into action by the contraction of the muscle attached to the furca, which tightens and pulls outwards the membrane to which their bases are attached. There are thus two ways in which the teeth may be used; in the first the labellar rods are rotated in an anterior and posterior plane on their fixed point at the end of the labial gutter, and the teeth are thus drawn across the surface like a scraper. To render this efficient the anterior and median sets of muscles have become greatly increased in size, and to provide attach- ment for them the posterior surface of the labial gutter has developed a prominent keel shaped backward projection, very prominent in transverse sections of the proboscis and recalling the similar structure seen in Stomoxys. In the second process, the furca is retracted upwards and the inner wall of the labella tightened, so that the teeth are rotated outwards in the socket formed by the discal sclerite, and their cutting edges thus pulled through the skin of the host. It is probable that both of these mechanisms are used when making the wound from which the fly obtains its food. The details of the structure of this fly and two others (one a new species) have been closely studied with a view to following out the development of the structure and mechanism of the proboscis in the more complex blood sucking Muscids; the results of this work, and other of a similar nature, will be published partly in the Bulletin of Medical Entomology and partly in the scientific memoirs.

Three inoculations of the autogenous streptococcus vaccine (5xii again are excessively delicate and may die out as a result of a short exposure to a lower tem- perature than that of blood heat. The best results with these organisms are to be expected if the cultures are made clinically and then conveyed in a portable incubator to the laboratory for further study. Gonococcus vaccinexiii the neutral red, lactose peptone water medium at the end of 24 hours. This did not however progress any further even after incubation for many days. The cultures remained as a thin emulsion even after a full week's incubation, creating an impression that the trace of initial acidity in the lactose medium inhibited further multiplication. Such slight acidity is known to be produced by the organism in milk, but in this medium there soon follows a progressively increasing alkalinity up to about two weeks or so. Another peculiarity observed was that most of the strains when grown on agar showed sooner or later an inequality in the size of different colonies, suggesting impurity of culture. All the colonies, big and small, were however equally transparent almost as much as those of B. Typhosus, but the very large colonies tooked more opaque on account of their relative thickness. From the subjoined table it is seen that the B. Dysenteriae was isolated in six cases out of eleven, the organisms belonging to the Shiga as well as the Flexner typesxiv By far the most interesting case treated was that of a European child, one year old, suffering from acute dysentery of a very toxic type. B. Dysenteriae (Flexure group-Strain Mount) was isolated from the stool at the end. of the first week and an autogenous vaccine prepared. Soon after the first dose of 2.5 millions was given the temperature which had run high from the beginning of the illness showed a marked drop and the child which was in a typhoid condition made a rapid and uninterrupted recovery after the administration of two further doses of five and ten millions given at intervals of 48 and 72 hours respectively. NOTES ON A CUTANEOUS STREPTO-COCCUS AFFECTION. By Assistant Surgeon T. Seethapathy Aiyar, L.M. & S. In February 1911, Lieut.-Col. Giffard, I M.S., Superintendent of the Government Maternity Hospital, sent some agars smeared with serous exudation from a case of what appeared to be Pemphigus Neanotorum, and suggested that, a strepto coccus might be the causative organism. On cultivation small dew-drop colonies of a strepto-coccus, with here and there a few colonies of staphylo-coccus aureus developed. Before a vaccine could be made the child expired. This gave an impetus to further study of the etiology and treatment of the affection as found in children and adults. The skin-eruption (known as " Karappan " in Tamil) is fairly common in Indian children under six years, and is sometimes also found among adults. It is mostly confined to the extre- meties and scalp, but is occasionally found on the trunk, and very rarely on the face. The eruption takes the form of serous vesicles or pustules of the size of a pea and later the form of bullæ (recognised as moist eczemas) exuding a thin clear fluid. In a few cases the vesicles are confined to a particular area of the skin and by coalescing form into a soft ulcerous patch. The affection is not generally accompanied with any constitutional disturbance or local pain. Some- times an inflammatory areola is seen around the eruption which is specially noticeable on white skins. When the eruption occurs in the extremeties there is often swelling of the lymphatic glands in the groin or axilla. In acute cases, it appears all over the body and simu- lates a mild form of small-pox: sometimes it takes on a chronic course lasting for about a year. On healing it leaves behind black pigmented areas of skin; hence the Tamil name " Karappan ". In mild cases it subsides only giving rise to a few eruptions on different parts of the body. On the scalp the disease shows itself as a more extensive inflammation, exuding an offensive fluid. which mats the hair into knots. In such severe conditions there is commonly slight fever, accompanied with shivering and glandular swellings in the neck. Cultural Findings. On smearing the surface of ordinary nutrient agar or better sérosité agar with any of the various exudations found in the lesion and incubating the tubes at 37º centigrade a growth of dew- drop like colonies mostly in a pure state but sometimes associated with a few colonies of staphylo- coccus Pyogenes Aureus is seen after 24 hours. Each colony is transparent and of the size of a pin-head. Broth cultures of the same examined under microscope reveal a strepto-coccus brevis which stains with all ordinary aniline dyes and is gram-positive. Though not yet thoroughly estab- lished it seems to correspond to strepto-coccus faecales according to Gordon's classification. It grows more luxuriantly on. serosite media than on ordinary nutrient media. The organism does not produce any marked pathogenic effect on rabbits. The different strains isolated from the affection were subjected to a test for identity along with other strepto-cocci isolated from septic fever and boils. The organisms were smeared all over agar slopes, allowed to grow for two days and the resulting growths were then removed. Other strains were then inoculated on the agars thus treated. In most cases, scanty or no secondary growth took place, so, as far as this test may be relied on many of the organisms isolated would appear to be of the same nature. Vaccine Therapy. A vaccine was made of the organism in the usual way of making bacterial vaccines. As the growth is rather scanty a large number of serum agar slopes are inoculated with the organisms and allowed to grow for 48 hours in the incubator. The growth is then emulsified and heated. to 60° centigrade for about half an hour. Special care has to be taken over counting and stand- ardising the vaccine as it is extremely potent. A first dose of not more than two and a half millions has to be tried as higher doses may cause great exacerbation of the condition. Each successive dose may be increased by two or three million cocci till fifteen millions are reached. Three to four days after the first injection, in the absence of exacerbation, a surprising subsi. dance of the eruption takes place. It dries up with scale formation which can be easily removed with the help of a warm bath. Notes on cases treated. 1.

24 GUNTUR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN25 REPORT. Some rather curious results are seen on this occasion. At the headworks the water contains an exceedingly large number of organisms, of which, however, very few indeed are derived from animals. After the Service Reservoir is passed we find a most notable reduction in the total count but the f26 NELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN27 REPORT. It is rather surprising to find that although there was no water in the bed of the river, except what remained in stagnant pools, that the quality was so good. It was better than it has ever been at this season, and as the filtration effected by passage through the gallery was quite effective, the water is distributed was very good indeed. This is all the more gratifying as there were most undesirable features in the immediate neighbourhood of the gallery, when these examinations were commenced. Chemically the water is on the hard side and contains more chloride and soluble sulphate than is quite desirable. The unfiltered water also shows a good deal of organic matter, mainly of animal origin, but this is probably in suspension, as the filtered water only shows a little organic matter of vegetable origin. It is rare to find filtration exerting such a good effect on water in South India. Chemical Analyses. SAMPLE I SAMPLE IV Physical appearances. Colour and Transparency. Slightly yellowish but clear.

Bacteriologically the water corresponds to that of Tanjore; filtration does not seem to have purified it in any way. All the samples suggest gross pollution for they are heavy with excre- mental organisms. This state of affairs is probably due to the repairing of the infiltration gallery and the consequent admixture of unfiltered water. Chemically the samples have not deteriorated much.

Bacteriologically the water from the headworks is very good as it only shows one organism. in 5 cc. and the total count is markedly low; last quarter much the same was noted although the number of organisms present in the total count was higher. The first tap after the Service Reservoir however shows a totally different state of affairs; it contains excremental organisms in 1 cc. and nearly one-third of these prove to be Bacillus Coli communis showing that it has been grossly contaminated. The Service Reservoir should be carefully examined in order to find out the explanation of this contamination. The water in the distributary system shows some- improvement but it has not reached the good quality of the water from the headworks. Chemically the water is much the, same as last quarter.

45 (c) GUNTÚR. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN45(d) REPORT. Bacteriologically the water at the headworks remains in much the same state as was reported previously; the water at headworks is therefore of a good quality. The water in the service reservoir however shews quite the opposite state of affairs, so that contamination must be taking place either en route or at the reservoir. The water in the distributary system is of uniform quality resembling that of the service reservoir. Chemically the water has not undergone any appreciable change since the previous quarter.

68 VELLORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN-28TH SEPTEMBER 1911. REMARKS.69 REPORT. The results of Bacteriological analysis of the samples are worse during this quarter than those of the last occasion. There is more than tenfold increase in the total count and fivefold in the excremental organisms. Filtration has not so far been effective. The quality of water supplied is thus on the retrograde step. It was good in March, medium in June and bad in September. This requires some investigation. Chemically the water continues to be good.

74 TANJORE. WATER SAMPLES TAKEN75 REPORT. The river water continues to be bad, but filtration has decidedly improved it, there having been a decided reduction in the total organisms present as well as the excremental forms. Of the samples taken at the distributary system, that from the Municipal Office is highly polluted. This condition has been noted on several previous occasions pointing to serious leakage in that section of the pipes.
