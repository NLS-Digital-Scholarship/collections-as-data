NOTE.SECT. II.] EXECUTIVE MEDICAL OFFICERS (MILITARY.) 23 The persons who shall be pronounced by the examiners to be the best qualified in all respects, will be appointed to fill the requisite number, of appointments as assistant surgeons in Her Majesty's Indian army. Their position on the list of assistant surgeons will be determined by the combined result of the preliminary and final examinations and so far as the require- ments of the service will permit, they will have the choice of Presidency in India, according to their position on that list. 12. Assistant Surgeons who shall neglect or refuse to proceed to India under the orders of the Secretary of State for India, within two months from the date of their appointment, will be considered as having forfeited it, unless special circumstances shall justify a departure from this regulation. 13. The physical fitness of candidates will be determined previous to examination, at Chelsea Hospital, by a Board of medical officers, who are required to certify that the candidate's vision is sufficiently good to enable him to perform any surgical operation without the aid of glasses. A moderate degree of myopia would not be considered a disqualification, provided it did not necessitate the use of glasses during the performance of operations, and and that no organic disease existed. Every candidate must also be free from organic disease of other organs, and from constitutional weakness, or other disability likely to unfit him for military service in India. 14. The Examinations for admission to the Indian medical service are notified by public advertisement, and will usually take place twice a year, viz., in February and in August. 15.

At the end of every month, the assistant surgeon will make a selection of not less than six cases, which have been recorded in the journal, and submit them, through his immediate superior, to the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals of the circle, who will transmit them to the Inspector General Indian Medical Department. d. The cases so selected should be fully reported, both as to diagnosis and treatment. They should be copied on sheets of foolscap paper, stitched together, folded, and docketted like other professional papers. It is especially directed that each monthly journal shall contain a full commentary on the cases treated, and that whenever cases have ended fatally, the pathological conditions of affected organs shall be fully noted. e. Deputy Inspectors General of Hospitals are enjoined to inspect all probationary journals with particular care, and to enter their opinions in the way of comment on such points of practice as may appear to require notice. If the Deputy Inspector General feels it necessary to enter critical notes on the journals, they are to be returned to the young medical officer, before being passed on to the Inspector General's office. Probationary Assistant surgeons, who may be doing duty at the Presidency, are enjoined to attend the practice of the Eye-Infirmary, Lying-in, and Lock Hospitals, especially on the days set apart for operations or examinations. f. After three months' probationary duty under a medical officer of the Indian Medical Department, the Assistant Surgeon will, if the exigencies of the service permit, be transferred to a hospital in which European military sick are treated. These periods of probationary duty may be shortened or lengthened, according to the mode in which the assistant surgeon con- ducts his duties, at the discretion of the Head of the Medical Depart- ment. 23.

In cases of emergency Medical Officers, without reference to their particular charge, will afford the most prompt assistance, to all cases in which their services are called for, informing the patient at the same time, who his proper medical attendant is. (e.) Medical certificates granted by private practitioners to Military Officers, cannot under any circumstances be recognized: but such certificates when countersigned (after perusal of the case and personal examination of the patient) by the Medical Officer of the district, are to be submitted for the decision of a board of Medical Officers, convened under the orders of the Officer Commanding the Division. (f) Officers are not to quit the Hills for the purpose of returning to their duty, until such period, short of the expiration of their leave, as will allow them time, at the prescribed rate of marching or travelling, to join : and then only upon being reported by the Medical Officer of their district as fit to join. (g.) The families of Military Officers, if in military employ, are entitled to gratuitous medical aid from the Surgeon of the district in which they reside. (h) Officers of Her Majesty's British and Madras Armies, residing on the Neilgherries, are available, under orders from the Officer Commanding the Mysore Division, for employment at Wellington, or other station on the Hills, on Military duties, such as courts-martial, (superior to regimental,) or mixed committees of Her Majesty's service, unless reported unfit by their medical attendant. G. O. C. C. No. 106 of 1864. (i) A monthly Register or Roster will be kept by each Medical Officer, shewing the rank and names of the officers considered eligible for such employment, who will forward the register on the 1st or 2nd of each month to the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General of the divi- sion. All officers not under medical treatment will present themselves to the Medical Officer, in whose district they reside on or about the last day in each month, to enable him to prepare the register. (j) This arrangement is intended to obviate the necessity of withdraw- ing officers from distant stations, for the performance of duties which can be readily carried on locally, and it is to be distinctly understood that such employ will confer no claim to extra allowances, or to compensation for any other allowances suspended during residence on the Hills; nor is an officer to be detailed for such duty, if it shall interfere with the tenor of his medical certificate by placing him on duty of uncertain duration, and thus preventing his return to duty within the period originally specified, unless under special sanction to be specially obtained from Army Head-quarters. (k.) Printed copies of these rules are supplied from Madras to each K

Bottles, &c., should be enclosed in a thick layer of cotton, and all placed in tin, soldered, and sealed. When wooden boxes must be used, these should be sealed and taped at every open- ing, below as well as above. (c.) All liquid and animal matters liable to decomposition, should be put up in, or mixed with, the strongest spirit available; this effectually pre- vents decomposition, and without interfering with the subsequent analysis, obviates many serious accidents. (d.) A minute and detailed account of the case, symptoms, appearances on dissection, and treatment, if any, should in every instance be forwarded, as these afford a clue, not only to the kind or class of poison made use of, but also not unfrequently, to the individual or identical poison itself. (e.) In cases where arsenic or any other mineral poison is suspected, and when the patient has survived for twenty-four hours or more after its exhibi- tion, the liver should be sent, as well as the stomach and a part of the intestines, also a portion of any suspected matter, which might have been the vehicle of exhibiting the poison, as food, rice, congee-water, &c. When any substance vomited by a patient is forwarded, it should be mentioned whether it is a por- tion of the first vomiting or not; the matters emitted by the first vomitings are most likely to contain portions of the poison. 145.

In order to bring the whole of the Medical Subordinates of a Dis- trict in civil employ, in turn, under the eye of a superior professional officer, it is directed that all Revenue Officers when returning to stations where they are no longer dependent for profes- sional aid on the services of the Medical Subordinates attached to their res- pective offices, shall direct such Medical Subordinates to place themselves under the orders of the chief Medical Officer of the station, until such time as their exclusive services may again be required for duty elsewhere. 89. When thus temporarily placed under the orders of the Medical Officer, the subordinates may be employed by him only at the Head-quarter Station, until required by their departmental superiors. 90. Cases will sometimes arise when the services of Hospital Assistants not under the immediate orders of the Civil Surgeon, whether resident at the Zillah station or in the provinces, may be required for emergent duty in any part of the district. In all such cases, however, the permission of their departmental superiors must be previously obtained by the Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals, or the Zillah Surgeon, and Government will hold the departmental officers responsible in the event of their refusing the services of their subordinates when required on emergency for other duty than that to which they have been specially nominated.
