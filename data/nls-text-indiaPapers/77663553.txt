Proceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Modical and Sanitary) Department, No. 156 S., dated 23rd May 1912. READNote on the report of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum, Lahore, for the triennium 19092 General remarks.[The text of this Report is limited to five pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PUNJAB LUNATIC ASYLUM, for the years 1909,1910 and 1911. DURING the three years under review the total population has been 837, 817 and 841, practically showing a continuation of the small steady increase which had been always noted since the original opening of the building in March 1900, when it was only 465. As has been remarked before, this by no means betokens any general increase of lunacy in the province, but its explanation lies2 affected, than did the former small and ill-arranged and unsuitable compound. Being solidly built and with washable floors and walls they do not afford the facilities for constant destruction that all the older buildings do, nor are they like those liable to become with advancing years impregnated with filth and disease germs; the upper floor of the main wards being completely shut off have enabled us to segregate cases of pneumonia, &c., and to finally stop the fatal habit of mud eating that was spreading so widely as to greatly increase the mortality, while the large tubercular area where selected patients live practically in the open air has been a wonderful success; emaciated moribund men transferred there rapidly becoming fat and taking on a new lease of life. The benefits of these new " pucca," well built erections are so striking and obvious that it is devoutly to be hoped that Government will be soon able to see its way to providing funds for the paving and cementing of floors and walls of all the old barracks and cells; as a result of this the comfort of the occupants would be immeasurably increased and a large amount of disease prevented and much expense for the constant repairs now necessary would then be obviated. Estimates and plans for these improvements have been already sent in, and if these changes can be carried out an enormous improve- ment will be effected in the entire asylum. Though nominally there is no overcrowding there actually is some of a particular kind which is very acutely felt. With the gradual increase in the population the number of men requiring separate accommodation at night is still more rapidly increasing, so much so that it is now becoming very difficult to provide sufficient " cells," as most of the original buildings were in barrack form, and there is only separate accommodation for 200, while far more than that number should at least at night sleep alone. This requirement does not, it must be remembered, simply refer to the dangerous insane (though as a matter of fact most are at one time or another of that class), but also includes the man who by his filthy habits or his tendency to annoy or bully others and to be constantly noisy it is impossible to allow to remain in a barrack, and still more urgently does it include the man addicted to sodomy, often of a brutal character, which is such a common habit among the large number of Pathans received here. It is very desirable that there should be a special and separate quaran- tine enclosure for new comers (at present a block of the ordinary cells is reserved for this purpose, thus still further lessening the accommodation). If a separate enclosure with a block of cubicles for some 20 could be provided for this purpose it would be an immense boon and greatly relieve the imme- diate necessities, for which also it may be hoped that some method of divid- ing up some of the old barracks into cubicles can be devised. It may be here remarked that every additional year's experience more firmly convinces one that among the men at least separate accommodation ought to be provided for almost all at night, and that nothing is more obnoxious or more uncomfort- able, miserable and unhealthy for the unfortunate occupants than the large barracks formerly provided. Females. The female asylum is absolutely separate from that for the men; it is well arranged and convenient, and has the immeasurable advantage over that for the males in being under the direct supervision of four Franciscan sisters who labour with incessant patience, gentleness and assiduity in the care of the unfortunate beings in their charge, and of whose good qualities it is impossible to speak too highly. Nothing would be of greater benefit than to find a similar suitable religious body who would take charge of the men; but hitherto it has not been possible to find any such, and it is out of the question on account of the expense to ask for that which would be of equal service3 A new quarantine ward with separate accommodation for four has, however, just been completed and opened, and is of great service both for the segregation of the new arrivals and in lessening the strain on the scanty separate accommodation (for 20) hitherto provided; it had been long needed. A very desirable addition to the asylum would be a room for mud-eaters (which habit is also spreading among the women) on an upper storey to prevent earth being given to them by others and provided with paved floors and cemented walls. No other means have been found of any use in checking this habit, which, if persisted in, always leads to the death of the patient, and the remedy suggested has among the men proved very effectual. Type of cases. The type of cases seen here continues the same as in former years; speak- ing technically the diseases most com- mon in Europe4 Compounds. Amusements. gives every variety of employment suitable to different ages and physique. A number of patients are also employed on the actual duties of maintenance of the asylum-cooking, cleanliness, &c.,5 a small separate quarantine ward such as has been lately provided for the female asylum is very urgently needed in the male one. The death-rate in 1909-10, two unhealthy years, though only a little high has been materially reduced to 9.13 per cent. in 1911, and when it is remembered that the death-rate for insanes all over the world is rarely under 10, this may be claimed as fairly satisfactory. Escapes. Escapes occasionally occur, usually of men working outside. In 1909 there were two such, in 1910 four and in 1911 two : one of these was recaptured within half an hour, and most of the others after a very short interval. One of the men who escaped during 1910, however, was a criminal lunatic. This escape could only have been possible from the grossest carelessness or con- nivance, and the men concerned were all severely punished. All the remainder were as before said insanes who slipped away from the garden or compounds, and in whose case there was no reason to suspect anything beyond temporary carelessness. One unfortunate man was suddenly murdered at night by his insane companion in May 1909, who though several years in the asylum had up to then never previously shown signs of a violent disposition. Suicide. One man committed suicide. This was an aged Sikh confined after having made a murderous assault on his sister- in-law. In a fit of depression from a recurrence of his malady he hanged himself one night to the grated door of his room by a portion of his clothing. Cost. The usual statistics and returns are appended and do not require much detailed explanation except as regards the cost of working. With the increasing population the expenses of the institution have necessarily risen, though coinci- dentally the receipts for paying patients have also increased in each year, as well as the total value of articles manufactured by the patients. Those for miscel- laneous receipts, owing to the labour of the inmates having of necessity become more restricted to the actual requirements of the asylum (from its increased population), have slightly fallen. The chief item of cost is of course that for diet which varies naturally with the number of patients and the dearness of provisions, and the same re- mark applies practically to contingencies. The cost of superintendence varies somewhat with the seniority of the Medical Officers in charge. A considerable share of the expenditure on clothing is absorbed in replacing the articles destroyed by the destructive acutely insane, and the amount destroyed in this way is enormous, and can scarcely be controlled or prevented, more especially in the cold season when a patient must have some means of protection from the weather. The augmented Public Works charges in 1911 are explained by the pro- vision of the new female quarantine ward and the erection of much needed verandahs to the Sisters' quarters at the asylum. Staff. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewens held charge as Superintendent until October 1909, when he left on a year's furlough and has retained his post since his return in October 1910, until the present time, while during his absence Captain A. S. M. Peebles, I. M. S., had charge of the asylum. Military Assistant Surgeon Chamarett succeeded Military Assistant Surgeon Cox, a most able and conscientious and hardworking official, as Deputy Superintendent on 5th May 1909, and was in his turn succeeded on 18th Nov- ember 1910 by Military Assistant Surgeon Hottinger who still holds the post; in him the Superintendent is fortunate in having a most able, painstaking and efficient assistant whose sympathetic and kind treatment of the patients entrusted to him cannot be surpassed, and whose skill as a medical man renders him of great value. The Franciscan Sisters in charge of the female asylum continue to work with that devotion and zeal for their duties and that kindness and sym- pathy for their patients that has always characterised them. Their presence has entirely changed the status and condition of that institution, and it is impossi- ble to speak too highly of the benefits derived from their assistance. LAHORE: G. F. W.

Proceedings of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 363, dated the 2nd June 1915. READ 2 6. The total annual cost of the asylum averaged in round figures Rs. 1,64,000 yearly during the triennium as against an average of Rs. 1,15,000 in the previous triennium. The main item of increase is under building charges. 7. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewens who had held charge of the asylum since its foundation some 15 years ago died on the 9th September 1914. The Lieut- enant-Governor heartily endorses the remarks made in the report and by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals on his work as Superintendent. The institution owes its progress in efficiency and popularity almost entirely to his untiring efforts and sympathetic care of the inmates, and in him Government has lost a most capable officer and the patients a true friend. His Honour also desires to express his regret at the death of Sister Léonore of the Franciscan Sisters who have continued to look after the female portion of the asylum with their usual unfailing care and solicitude. ORDER.No. 2780 GENL. FROM COLONEL C. J. BAMBER, I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, TO THE ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, PUNJAB. Dated Lahore, the 6th April 1915. SIR, I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the Triennial Report on the working of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for 1912-1914. 2. The Report which is full and interesting calls for very few remaks. A pleasing feature in the history of the asylum during the past fifteen years is the growing popularity of the institution particularly on the female side. The centralisation and specialisation of the treatment of lunatics has greatly improved the lot of asylum inmates and this, as well as the provision of ample accommodation has probably, without any general increase of lunacy, stimu- lated the demand for admission to the asylum. The percentage of cures is also satisfactory, but it would be higher if insanes were admitted early and as pointed out by the Superintendent the benefit of early admission for treatment in all cases cannot be too strongly emphasised. Unfortunately there have been many delays in getting insanes admitted into the asylum after certification. All the cases in which un- necessary delay occurred have been reported to Government and I hope this will prevent to a great extent the recurrence of such delays in the future. 3. The question of securing a good and reliable attendant staff is still a difficult one and it is hoped that the increased rates of pay that will come into force from the 1st April, 1915, will have the desired effect of attracting the proper class of man. It is satisfactory to know that the appointment of two superior Indian warders, retired non-commissioned officers of the Indian Army, has been a success. Quarters for these two warders will be provided during the current year and this will tend to keep them contented and to continue to work with zeal and efficiency. It would perhaps be a good thing if the Superintendent arranged to employ reservists or pensioners of the Indian Army as attendants. He would probably succeed in obtaining good men through the various Recruiting Staff Officers. At all events the experiment might be tried. The construction of the block of 10 additional quarters for the attendant staff will be taken in hand almost immediately as funds have been allotted for the work during 1915-10. The Superintendent seems to doubt whether it will be possible to retain a really good European Warder as the appointment is by no means attractive. It is perhaps too early to make a definite pronouncement. The provision of quarters for the warder at a very early date is a matter of great urgency and I hope funds will be provided and the work completed within the next six months. The longer construction is delayed the more unattractive will the appointment be considered. Besides it is patent that the entire staff must live on the premises if work is to be carried out efficiently. 4. The death during the year of the late Colonel Ewens who had been the permanent Superintendent for nearly 15 years deprived the Punjab of an officer whom it will be most difficult to replace.
2 It is no exaggeration to say that the present high state of efficiency of the asylum is due solely to that officer's abilities, patience, kindness and untiring energy. He was ever solicitous for the welfare of the inmates and left no stone unturned to ameliorate their pitiable condition, and every visitor to the asylum must have been struck with his sympathetic treatment of the patients and his intimate knowledge of their individual history and idiosyncrasies. His untimely demise is deeply regretted and has been a great loss to the Punjab Lunatic Asylum. Captain H. A. H. Robson held charge of the asylum for a little over two months when he reverted to military duty and during this short period showed great promise and carried out his duties efficiently. I have much pleasure in recording my high appreciation of the excellent services rendered by Lieutenant. Fleming during the year. For nearly three weeks after the death of the late Colonel Ewens he worked single handed as the Assistant Deputy Superintendent reverted to military duty on the outbreak of war. He has a considerable grasp of detail and is an asset to the asylum staff. The Franciscan Sisters' devotion to the welfare of their unfortunate charges is beyond all praise and the popularity of the female section of the asylum is in no small measure due to their unfailing energy and solicitude, and the death, in July last, of Sister Leonore must be as great a loss to their com- munity as it is to the asylum. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, C. J. BAMBER, COL., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
Triennial report on the working of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum, Lahore, for 1912-14. Population. During the three years under report the total population for each year has been 916, 959 and 991 shewing a steady and progressive increase and an advance of 150 in the last year on the largest number reported in any previous triennial report, viz, 841 in 1911. This fact alone is evidence of the growing popularity of the institution, for ever since its inauguration in 1900, this steady growth has been maintain- ed, and a comparison with the first year of its history will not be out of place. In 1900 the total population was 608, 487 males and 121 females, and in the last year of the present triennium under review 991, 775 males and 216 females From this it will be seen that the increase on the side of the females as compared with the males is proportionately greater, a point that is extremely satisfactory to note, considering that with the vast majority there is a con- servative dislike to bringing their women-folk away from their homes for treat- ment in a public institution such as this, and it may reasonably be presumed that the benefits of the asylum are more widely known amongst the general population, who of themselves frequently bring up their relatives and friends for treatment from the remotest part of the province, and not, infrequently, from other parts of the country The measure of popularity enjoyed by the female asylum has no doubt been greatly enhanced by the solicitude and sympathetic treatment of the Franciscan Sisters who have now been in charge of this branch for the past 12 years. Increase in the asylum population is by no means commensurate with the increase of insanity in the province, for according to the census figures of 1911, the ratio of insanes per 100,000 of the population has decreased from 35 to 26 as compared with those so afflicted in the census year 1901. Accommodation. At the beginning of the last triennium (1909), the overcrowding which was most acute on the male side automati- cally disappeared on the opening of the new hospital buildings and since then there has been ample room everywhere. During 1914 a quarantine enclosure containing a block of 20 pucca well ventilated cubicles has been added and a long felt want for the segregation of fresh arrivals removed. The foundation of this structure is so arranged as to permit of the easy addition of an upper storey. A separate infectious diseases enclosure has also been provided during the past year. The need of such accommodation was much felt during the cholera epidemics of 1912 and 1913, there being no proper place for the seclusion of the so affected. Conglomerate flooring and cemented dadoes have been provided in all cells and barracks. This much required work has made a great improvement in the patients' comfort and has already tended to ameliorate diseases such as bowel complaints and tubercle, which probably to a great extent were due to the infected kutcha floors on which a large number of the patients were in the habit of sleeping. The accommodation though adequate as to the total number is not sufficient to provide separate accommodation ; this, at present, however, is being remedied, two of the sleeping accommodation barracks are being converted into 52 cubicles and will for the present amply meet the requirements for separate accommodation, a point on which and rightly so, much stress was laid in the last triennial report, for every lunatic, no matter how quiet, must be looked upon as being, at sometime, potentially dangerous. The conversion of these barracks into cubicles has de facto reduced the general accommodation for the barracks which previously had room for 100 inmates, and will now on their conversion provide for 52 or a decrease in the general total accommodation of the institution by 48, and it is obvious with the rapid and steady increase of the populatian that an extension will be required in the very near future, an ex- tension which should certainly take the form of cubicles.
2 Females. This branch still continues under the supervision of the Franciscan Sisters who render unfailing devotion towards their charges. There has never been any overcrowding here. The same remark as to the want of separate rooms applies here as on the male side, but this has now been remedied by the conversion of one of the sleeping barracks into cubicles. In addition 4 new annexes are being provided, each consisting of a separate enclosure with a large room. These compounds will be an immense boon for the noisy, filthy, and destructive, and will also be useful in the segregation of infectious cases. The diminution in the general accommodation owing to the conversion of a barrack into cubicles has been more than compensated for by the building of these annexes. The female hospital has been entirely renovated by the substitution of conglomerate flooring and a dado of minton tiling which apart from enhanc- ing the appearance of the rooms has contributed to the greater comfort and sanitary condition of the patients. A very pleasing feature is the continued growth in the number of the inmates and what more emphasises the great popularity of this branch of the asylum is the increasing number of the better class of Indian women who are being brought here for treatment. The European ward is not sufficient for the requirements of the province, and it has occasionally been found necessary to refuse admission. Failing the speedy completion of the Ranchi asylum it will certainly be necessary to increase the accommodation for this class at Lahore. Types of cases. The largest number admitted belongs to one or other of the forms of Mania including Haschisch and it accounts for 48.62 per cent. of the total number of admissions during the triennium. Out of this number Charas, Bhang and other toxic drugs form 15.36 per cent. Next in number is Melancholia with 13.78 per cent. and lastly varieties of Dementia 13.40 per cent are the most frequent types. Of these Dementia Praecox shows an increasing number. Idiopathic Mania and Melancholia (the German Mania Depressive) which was formerly so rare out here exhibits a gradually increasing number and is found chiefly amongst the more literate class of patients, a feature which should not be lost sight of as years go on, an indication of an increase in the growing education of the general population For the first time there has been an admission of a case suffering from general paralysis of the insane ; but it occurred in an European and calls for no special comment. This disease has never been known here in an Indian patient. Violence, destructiveness, and dangerous habits continue to be the car- dinal feature of the Punjab insane and this for the obvious reason that the harmless are rarely if ever brought for treatment and the type of race from which he comes, the Pathan, Jat and Punjabi Muhammadan is more boisterous and truculent than the down country man. The percentage of cures continue satisfactory being highest in the year 1912, making 22.71 per cent on the average strength and 62.50 per cent on the admissions. This high standard of recoveries has continued though in somewhat smaller numbers in the two following years. It is chiefly the acute Hemp drug cases that make a rapid recovery and account for the large pro- portion of the cures. The exhaustion Psychoses usually recover, provided they are admitted early and one cannot too much emphasise the benefit of early admission for treatment in all cases of insanity especially those due to an ex- haustive cause, a delay of 10 days making all the difference to their ultimate recovery. Attendant Staff. The same difficulty is experienced in obtaining an efficient and reliable class of attendant. The very objec- tionable nature of the work, which is both dangerous and dirty, no doubt deters a better class of recruit from present- ing himself. Every inducement has been made to obtain suitable men, but without avail ; as a greater attraction the pay of these men will still further be raised with effect from the ensuing financial year; and the rates to be adopted compare extremely favourably with most other classes of the same status.
3 The introduction of 2 superior Indian warders, retired non-commissioned officers of the native army is a measure that has more than justified itself. These men, and we have been extremely fortunate in getting a good type, have rapidly grasped the nature of their duties and proved themselves entirely reliable and very sympathic in the care of the insane. Perforce of good example their line of conduct has, it would appear, to a degree permeated the subordinate staff, and it is certainly not an extravagant hope that the future salvation of the Punjab asylum attendant may be due to the example of his superior confrére from the Indian army. A very line set of 15 quarters were added for this class in 1914, and the inconvenience and overcrowding has been relieved. More quarters are, however, required and the construction of a block of 10 is at persent under consideration and their early completion is certainly most desirable to meet the recent addition to the number of the attendant staff. An European warder has been engaged since the early part of 1914, but no quarters having been as yet provided, the incumbent has to make his own arrangements for housing. The appointment is by no means attractive and it is very doubtful whether a really good man could be induced to remain under present arrangements. Occupation. As heretofore it has been found that the insane is very much better controlled and more amenable to discip- line when he can be induced to take up some form of avocation, of these there are many in the asylum. All the cooking, washing, weaving, mulling of blankets, cleanliness and the endless varieties of occupation common to an asylum, are carried out by the inmates. The larger number of whom are chronic maniacs. They are often good, harmless workers, who under supervision perform most of the ordinary duties of the institution, and without whose presence a vastly multiplied staff of attendants and servants would be necessary. The criminal lunatic as usual forms a very large percentage of the working population, being entrusted with the occupations requiring some skill such as weaving, and mat making, or as dressers and attendants on the sick. The garden provides occupation for about 70 to 80 daily. It is an excellent and most healthy form of work and extremely remunerative, for all the vegetables, a matter of 6 to 7 maunds daily, required for asylum purposes, are provided from the garden and also all fodder required for the asylum cattle. In addition there has gradually matured a very good orchard which supplies all antiscorbutics required in the dietary En passant it may be mentioned that the asylum garden has secured two second prizes at the Lahore vegetable shows of 1913 and 1914. Amusements. These are continued in much the same way as before. The large pleasing and shady grounds afford am- ple space for enjoyment and, in sum- mer more especially, form an ideal spot. Gymnastics are provided though for some reason rarely or ever indulged in Newspapers and books are at the call of the more literate while cards and various varieties of Indian games are indulged in. A gramophone and magic lantern furnish a certain amount of amusement. On big holidays Indian musicians and jugglers and rag doll dancers perform, and batches of the quieter and better behaved are permitted to go to some of the circus performances, which visit Lahore. At these special festivals the ordinary diet is replaced by sweet rice or supplemented by sweets. Tobacco and cigarettes are supplied and to the better behaved and good workers is given a small stipend monthly which they can spend on any com- forts they choose. As far as possible the inmates are made comfortable and certainly the majority are belter off than they are in their own homes. Dietary. This is ample and of excellent quality, in addition, the ordinary diet is supplemented by a generous supply of extras for those actually mentally ill, and the hard workers are also given an increase above the usual diet. The expenditure is large, but it must be remembered this is absolutely essential
4 as the chief, and perhaps the only means, of saving a large number of those exhaustion cases from a life long ai ment which eventually ends in Dementia, is by liberal feeding, and the majority of such who are brought here are famished and starving ; their illness being due to exposure and want of food. Sickness and mortality. There has been nothing out of the ordinary to note about the ailments occurring Malaria as before accounts for the largest number of admissions into hospital though it occurs with less frequency among the lunatics than the attendant staff living outside the walls. Bowel complaints as usual occur frequently, and this, considering the extremely filthy habits of a great number who eat any rubbish they may pick up, is no matter of surprise, and is responsible for a large proportion of the deaths. The benefits of the new hospital accommodation are becoming more evident in the reduction of the number suffering from Anæmia and Anchy- lostomyasis. All mud eaters have now been completely segregated in rooms of an upper storey with tiled dadoes and pucca floors and their excreta is separately dessicated ; yet with all these precautions it is extraordinary to what an extent some will go to satisfy their craving for earth. Bricks are frequently pulled down from the walls above the glazed dado and the mud mortar voraciously eaten. Unfortunately, during 1912, and again in 1913, there were outbreaks of cholera. In neither of these did the attack assume serious proportion. The number of deaths being 4 and 2 respectively. It is difficult to account for the introduction of the disease in 1912 ; but in 1913 it may be assumed that the complaint was brought in from outside, as cholera was prevalent in the immediate vicinity of the asylum. The energetic and prompt measures taken on the appearance of the disease prevented its further spread. The mortality on the daily average strength of 10.40, 11.42 and 10.73 for the 3 years calls for no special comment and compares favourably with that registered in other asylums. Escapes. Of these there were five5 inmate and an excellent worker, and who had never previously shown any tendency of aggressiveness. On returning from work one evening finding another inmate lying in the sleeping berth usually occupied by him, he prompt- ly kicked the man in the abdomen rupturing his spleen. This incident markedly elucidates the axiom that every lunatic is potentially dangerous. In all these cases a magisterial enquiry was held, and in none was any blame attached to the attendant staff. Suicides. Of these there were two, one in March 1912 a case of mania who without giving any previous indication quietly strangled himself and the second in Sep- tember 1913, a melancholic, who was extremely depressed over an operation which had involved the amputation of his leg, strangled himself to the bed rail. In neither of these cases did the result of the inquest show any negligence on the part of the attendants. Cost of maintenance. With the growth of the institution there has been a progressive increased expenditure due in the main to an augmented population, larger salaries on account of superintendence and increased wages and cadre of attendance and the progressive rise in food stuffs. This latter item accounting for a very definite enhancement during the second half of 1914. The increase in book charges in 1913-14 is accounted for by the new works undertaken in these years by the Public Works Department. Clothing and bedding as usual form heavy items of expenditure, being some Rs. 12,000 for 1914. This is easily explained by the great destruction that is caused in these articles by a number of the inmates. On the receipt side the amount obtained from paying patients has increased to Rs. 10,176 showing a steadily progressive sum. In statement No. X it will be seen that the value of manufactured goods in column No 4 made over for asylum use still maintains its high level. These manufactures are a source of great profit and in addition to the benefit derived by providing some form of occupation for the patients they furnish all the warm clothing and blanketing and most of the summer uniform required. Superintendent and staff. The Superintendentship was held continuously up to the time of his death on the 9th September 1914 by Lieutenant-Colonel G. F. W. Ewens, I M.S., excepting for the period when he was on leave on private affairs from the 4th May to 5th November 1913 during which time Captain Owen Berkeley Hill, I.M.S., officiated in the appointment. From the 10th to 27th September 1914 Lieutenant J. F. Fleming, I.S.MD., carried out these duties and from the 28th September to 3rd December 1914 Captain H.A.H. Robson, I.M.S., held charge who was then relieved by Major E. L. Ward, I.M.S., who continued as Supeirntendent till the end of the year. The Punjab asylum began its career under the guidance of the late Lieutenant-Colonel G.F.W. Ewens some 15 years ago, and he continued to hold permanent charge until the time of his death.. From the first it has maintained its great state of efficiency, and its increasing popularity testifies to the care and treatment the patients receive. This state of efficiency and popu- larity has been entirely due to the unfailing energy and kindness displayed by the late Colonel Ewens. The Alienist Department, and the Punjab asylum, especially, have sustained a severe loss in the death of this estimable officer. His knowledge was profound, as was also his insight of the people and their language. His never failing kindness and sympathy to those in trouble endeared him to all who knew him. Through the generosity of Government, the valuable collection of books on mental diseases made by him have been secured to the asylum library. Military Assistant Surgeon E.F. Hottinger, I.S.M.D., was Deputy Super- intendent upto 16th May 1912 proving himself, as always, extremely able, trustworthy, and conscientious in the discharge of his duties. He was succeeded by Lieutenant J. F. Fleming, I.S.M.D. Of the latter officer, I have the know- ledge that Colonel Ewens thought most highly of him, and for my own part I
6 can endorse this opinion. Military Assistant Surgeons G. Mcguire, L.K. Allen and A. R. D'Abreu held charge of the hospital at various periods during the period under report and all of them worked satisfactorily. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Aziz-ud-din who had worked in the hospital from 22nd August 1912 to 10th July 1914 was reappointed to the asylum hospital on the recall of the Assistant Deputy Superintendent for field service. This Sub-Assistant Surgeon through his wide knowledge and experience of the in- mates proved himself a welcome addition to the asylum staff. The Female asylum remains under the care of the four Franciscan Sisters who continue to perform their duties with that self-abnegation and devotion which have characterised their work since their introduction in 1903. I regret to have to record the death of one of their number Sister Léonore who succumb- ed at her post in July 1914. E. L. WARD MAJOR, I.M.S., Superintendent, Punjab Lunatic Asylum.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PUNJAB LUNATIC ASYLUM For the year 1915. Lahore : PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT, GOVERNMENT PRINTING, PUNJAB. 1916.
No. 113-Medl.-1. FROM L. FRENCH, ESQUIRE, C.I.E., Offg. Additional Secretary to Government, Punjab, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Dated Lahore, 24th May 1916. Home Medical. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, the statistical tables of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the year 1915, with a note by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, and to convey the following remarks of the Lieutenant-Governor. 2. The population of the asylum continues to increase, and the daily average strength of 763.50 was the highest on record. New admissions amounted to 311, an increase of 47 on the previous year. There was a falling-off in the number discharged cured, but 52 cases ' mentally improved ' were transferred to the care of friends as against only 19 in 1914. 3. The year was a healthy one: there was no epidemic, and both the death rate and daily average sick rate were lower than in any year since 1910. There were no serious cases of escape or assault. 4. During the year an increased scale of pay of the attendant staff of the asylum was sanctioned. Electric lighting and fans were installed, extra cubicular accommodation was provided, and the congestion of the female asylum was relieved by the addition of four annexes. 5. Hemp drugs were as usual the cause of insanity in by far the greatest number of cases admitted during the year, heredity and epilepsy being the next most important ætiological factors. 6. His Honour regrets to observe the large number of typographical errors which disfigure some of the statements appended to the Report and trusts that the Inspector-General will see that these are avoided in future. His thanks are due to Major Ward for the care and attention with which he discharged his duties as Superintendent in addition to his heavy duties as Superintendent, Central Jail, and also to his assistant, Lieutenant Fleming, I. S. M. D. He has also to acknowledge once more the devotion of the Franciscan Sisters in their self-imposed labour of love. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, L. FRENCH, Offg. Additional Secretary to Government, Punjab. 266 CSNotes on the Statistical Table of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the year 1915.

The Superintendent has taken steps to ensure that as far as possible the drug is not introduced by attendants or friends in future. Sickness. 7. There were no epidemics of disease during the 3 years under report, and taking into consideration the tendency of the insane to suffer from diseases such as diarrhReport on the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the Triennium 1915-1917. Population. DURING the 3 years under report the total population for each year has been 1,053, 1,119 and 1,227 showing a definite and steady increase and an advance of 184, on the largest number reported in any previous year. This growth in the population has been a consistent feature ever since the opening of the institu- tion in 1900, when the number was only 465. The increase in the female branch is still maintained the largest number being 235 in 1915, as compared with the previous maximum of 216 in 1914. The very large increase among the number of males of 112 in 1917, on the total number in 1916, is accounted for by the great ingress of Military insanes from the various Overseas Expeditionary Forces, there being 123 admissions in the year from this class alone. Apart from this accidental source of increase, I think it may reasonably be claimed that the steady growth of the population is an index of the very high reputation of the Institution and the popularity it continues to enjoy. The number discharged cured during the last year of the triennium has shown a falling off, there being 108 against 142, and 116 in the two previous years, but when coupled with the number discharged as " improved" there is no very marked difference in the actual percentage of the mentality of those leaving the asylum, for it is obvious that the number cured and im- proved are to an extent linked together. The total number of criminal insanes also shows an increase, but the statistics are rather vitiated by the inclusion of re-admissions ; these are patients who have already been in the asylum leave to stand their trial, and being acquitted on the ground of insanity are not set free, but return to pass a certain period of complete immunity from insanity before being finally dis- charged. Again, from the fact that men are frequently sent in under the most trivial circumstances as criminals such as found wandering into some- body's compound, or prosecuted for having no ostensible means of livelihood, etc., when they are merely insane, it is obvious that numbers so calculated are by no means a correct indication of crime as connected with insanity. In this connection there has recently been discharged to stand his trial a young Punjabi Muhammadan who was admitted here as a criminal lunatic for a petty offence committed in the confusion following an overdose of charas. The man was acquitted with the felicitous result that he immediately exhibited his loyalty by enlisting in the Indian Army. There has been a marked falling off in the number of criminal females, there being only one admission during the past 3 years Accommodation. 2. With the large and rapid increase of numbers during the triennium, overcrowding has followed in all the sections more or less, the only one where such was not the case, was in the hospital enclosure which provides for 150 patients. In the early part of 1915, the variety of accommodation was very valuably augmented by an increase of separate rooms through the conversion of 3 of the sleeping barracks into 60 cubicles. This arrangement, though very excellent in its way and meeting a longfelt want, reduced the actual accom- modation in these areas by 40. To meet the overflow of numbers a top floor of 20 cells was added to the new quarantine block early in 1917, and this was certainly a useful and valuable adjunct. The time has undoubtedly arrived when a large augmentation to meet this steady increase has to be faced. There is no indication that the number of inmates will be anything but progressive as years go on, and the most appropriate way, in my opinion to meet it, would be to establish a distinct and separate enclosure adjoining the present institution solely for criminal lunatics to accommodate, say 200.
2 The average number of this class during the past three years has been 155. Such an enclosure would meet all the requirements of the criminal insanes of the province for many years to come and it would secure the longfelt want of having these men separated from the non-criminal class, which in the interests of the latter is highly desirable, and would facilitate better disciplinary control now hardly attainable owing to the mixing up of the two classes. Such a building, if agreed to, should certainly take the form of separate cubicular accommodation. This, it must be remembered, does not simply refer to the dangerous insane, but to the man who by his filthy habits or his tendency to annoy or bully others and is always noisy, it is impossible to allow to remain in a barrack, and still more does it include the one addicted to sodomy. The building of an enclosure such as this would take up a large area of garden land ; but as it is intended by Government in the very near future to increase the asylum acreage by the acquisition of some 50 acres in the immediate vicinity, no difficulty, on this account is likely to arise. With a new criminal enclosure accommodation would be left in the present asylum for 150 non-criminal lunatics. The accommodation for Europeans, both males and females, is sorely over- taxed, an addition of 4 sets of quarters for the European females has received sanction and the work will probably soon be in hand. The opening of the asylum at Ranchi in a short while will remove all congestion in this section, as it is proposed transferring a large number of the present inmates to that institution. The buildings were entirely fitted with electric lighting in the summer of 1915, and the European quarters and those of the superior officials with both lights and fans. Needless to say it is a great boon and greatly appreciated. Arrangements have also been made to replace the present steam engine which works the drinking water wells by an electric motor, but owing to the war there has been a delay in obtaining the necessary plant from England. Females. 3. The female asylum continues in its good fortune to be under the im- mediate control of the Franciscan Sisters of whose care and unfailing solicitude for the unfortunate beings in their charge one cannot speak too highly. Its popularity is steadily on the increase amongst all classes and markedly so amongst the superior class of Indian ladies whose friends realise the value of asylum treatment. This popularity, apart from the better knowledge of the benefits of asylum treatment which is gradually pervading the Indian public, I may say, is due in no small measure to the gentleness and assiduity of the Franciscan Sisterhood in the treatment of their patients. Excepting for the European section there has been no overcrowding and this, as has been said, will, it is hoped, soon be remedi- ed by an extension of the present quarters, and the transfer of some of the inmates to Ranchi Four annexes were provided early in 1915, each of which forms a distinct enclosure, having sleeping accommodation. One of these enclosures has been set apart for cases of tubercle and though not ideally suit- able has so far answered the purpose for which it has been allotted. Type of cases. 4. Admissions from mania still maintain pre-eminence in numbers and this is not to be wondered at considering the lingering prejudice that still obtains among the people of send- ing their insanes into an asylum unless they become so troublesome and dangerous by their disease as to make it impossible to retain them in their own houses. Mania in its various forms accounts for the largest number, 35 per cent. of admissions. Melancholia comes next with 20 per cent. Insanity caused by can- nabis Indica and its various preparations accounts for 14 per cent. of the admis- sions. Next in order of frequency are the various varieties of dementia and ex- haustion psychosis or confusional insanity. Exhaustion psychosis and an acute dementia is the form frequently exhibited by the military insanes due directly to shell shook or from the stress, privation and hardships naturally associated with a campaign.
3 General paralysis of the insane is credited with 2 admissions and for the first time in the annals of the asylum there has been an admission from this disease in an Indian patient. The second was a European, both of them died. Under the head of " declared to have recovered," &c., statement No. 6, there would appear to be an unusually large number, 46, due in a great measure to several military insanes who on arrival here showed no signs of insanity and who from the onset were mildly affected and made a rapid recovery. The characteristic features of the majority of the insanes are reckless violence and destruction. The incidence of idiopathic mania, the German mania depressive, is on the increase, and it is a fairly common feature among the patients admitted here. Attendant staff. 5. This as usual presents the greatest difficulty in the management of the asylum, a difficulty which has been more accen- tuated during the war owing to the dearth of obtaining labour of any description, and the fact of some of the most reliable men having gone away on military service. Asylum duties by no means appeal to the Indian, and it is no matter of surprise, being regarded as dirty, uncon- genial and dangerous, and the result is with few exceptions that a most disreputable and worthless class who are unable to find employment anywhere else come to the asylum as a last resource. It was hoped with the introduc- tion of superior warders at the end of the last triennium that there would be a leavening up in the kind feeling and sympathy of the lower attendant staff, and that a better body of men would be produced ; but this has not been attained. The service is extremely unattractive and the men although in the great majority incompetent will not remain for long. The reorganisation of the attendant staff is a serious question and one that will demand close attention when the stringency of labour is relaxed and more funds available for the provision of a better trained and more sympathe- tic body. Classes in ambulance training have been held and a portion of the attendants have been made fairly efficient in stretcher bearer drill. Ten new sets of quarters have been added in 1916, and the men are suitably housed and the 2 superior warders have also been provided with suitable accommodation. The sweepers have been increased by 3 in number owing to the extra labour involved by the opening up of the new quarantine section and the increase in the number of cubicles. This class has also been made quite comfortable by the provision of six new sets of quarters. Quarters for the European Warder were completed early in 1917, and the position of this official is now more comfortable than previously. This post has been frequently vacant during the first 2 years of the triennium owing to the inability of obtaining a suitable candidate. It has, however, I am glad to say, been very efficiently filled during the past year, and the present incumbent has made himself extremely useful, especially at a time when the European staff has been so reduced. Amusements. 6. These have followed on the usual lines in the provision of various Indian games, playing-cards, and the like. Many amuse themselves in the case of animals and birds ; the care of the latter appealing more to their instinct, parrots and pigeons are in great favour and rabbits and pea-fowl come in for a considerable amount of attention. In fact it is marvellous to what an extent some of the patients can go in training their pets. On one occasion there was a criminal lunatic who had a cat and pigeon both being his pets, whom he had trained to live in the greatest harmony. Gymnastics which are usually severely left alone, have come in for more attention with the arrival of the military insane. In addition a grama- phone and magic lantern is relied upon for a certain amount of amusement. Papers and books are furnished and the pictorial papers, which have been
4 introduced of late, are particularly in favour. Indian musicians and jugglers occasionally perform and the practice of providing sweet rice in place of the usual dietary on festive occasions still continues. For the Europeans in addition to parlour games, tennis has been introduced for the more sensible, and an occasional visit to the cinema is at times permitted, ride in a motor ambulance is frequently enjoyed by the better behaved military insanes. Tobacco in any form is in great demand and a liberal provision for this is made, the asylum farm is in a great measure meeting the demand. Small comforts are also procured by the hard working patients from the stipends put at their disposal which are given as a reward and incentive for good work. Dietary. 7. This has followed the usual liberal lines and is adequate and wholesome and frequently supplemented by extras when- ever required, the garden supplying all vege- tables as well as the condiments. Escapes. 8. There have been no escapes of a serious nature during the period under report. In 1915, 4 non-criminal lunatics escaped of whom 3 were captured and brought back again, one of these, months after, when at Multan, was taken in charge by the Police as being insane, they being unaware of his ever having escaped from the asylum. In 1910 and 1917 there were 3 and 2 escapes, respectively. Of these 2 were soon returned to the asylum. These escapes usually occur from the garden gangs and in all cases are due to the absolute carelessness of the attendants in charge, who show no sense of responsibility. In all cases the attendant culpable has been severely punished. The system of criminally prosecuting the attendants at fault in certain cases has proved efficacious though it cannot be very widely adopted at the present time owing to the difficulty of obtaining labour of any description. Deaths from violence. 9. With the exception of a death from rupture of the spleen in February 1915, which occurred in one of the men working in the garden, and which from the magisterial enquiry held may have happened through a fall, the subject having a very enlarged spleen, the institution has fortunately been immune from any incidents of this nature for the past 3 years, though all the elements for a quarrel are ever present in this asylum with its varied mixture of Sikhs, Punjabi Muhammadans and the truculent Pathan. There have as usual been numerous incidents of assaults, which have all had a favourable termination. Suicides. 10. There has been in 1917, one death from an overdose of opium in a criminal and there is strong reason to believe that the drug was self-administered owing to grief following the death of the man's wife. In this connection it may be mentioned the great difficulty, nay, the impossibility of preventing the surreptitious entry of toxic drugs through the agency of the attendants and sweepers. Regular searches are conducted of all such leaving and entering the asylum, but it is obvious that small parcels such as these drugs are in readily escape detection. Occupation. 11. As usual as large a number as possible have been employed in the various industries and forms of occupation occur- ring in the asylum, that is providing their mental condition permits. Some owing to the peculiarity of their illness absolutely refuse to work, from idiots and dements no form of work can be obtained and a few, chiefly cases of exhaustion, where complete rest is necessary any form of labour, however light, would be fatal to their well being. With the exclusion of these practically 50 per cent. of the inmates are employed in some way or other; and it is found that insanes are more amenable, contented and better controlled when engaged in some form of occupation. The major portion of the blankets, woollen and cotton clothing is made up locally and the Mat Factory is perennially employed in providing munj matting required for the inmates and also to meet the demands from outside. With the war and its attendant difficulty of obtaining sufficient raw material and the embargo on goods traffic the efforts of our industrial departments have necessarily been curtailed.
5 The garden continues to provide occupation for a large number, a most healthy and useful form of labour for the insanes, and last but not least very remunerative, as all the vegetables used and the fodder for the cattle are supplied from the asylum farm. There are now a large and sufficient number of fruit trees which provide all that is required in the way of antiscorbutics. It is hoped that with the acquisition of new land the grass farm industry, which had to be abandoned, some 10 years ago owing to the taking up of large areas for buildings and garden extensions will be restarted and be again a source of income. The garden, I may mention, has again been successful in its efforts at the Lahore Vegetable Show securing the second prize for Government Gardens in 1915, and finally the first in the Exhibition for 1916. Cost of maintenance. 12. This has considerably increased in 1917, the amount received from the treasury in this year being an advance of about Rs. 9,000 on that in 1916. Of this extra expenditure diet and clothing practically absorbs nearly Rs. 8,000 and establishment the remaining Rs. 1,000. The increase is accounted for by the high prices prevailing for articles of diet and raw materials required in the manufacture of clothing and blanketting, also to the rise in the population. The cost of medicines has also appreciably increased, being over 70 per cent. in 1917, as compared with the previous year. The increase in public works charges is Rs. 7,000 due to the provision of a top storey to the quarantine block. The amount deposited in the treasury by the asylum on account of paying patients, etc, for the year 1917, decreased by about Rs. 2,000 as compared with 1916. This is a varying amount depending upon the actual number of paying patients and in no way bearing any relation to the number of the inmates under treatment; further, for the last year or two moneys paid by municipalities, etc., instead of being deposited through the asylum are credited directly through the Accountant-General. The value of total credits over debits as shown in statement X, column " Results", exhibits an excess of a sum between seven and nine thousand entirely due to the labour of the inmates, an average of Rs. 10 per head of the total population and this by no means includes the profit derived from the multifarious forms of occupation, apart from the garden and factories. Sickness and mortality. 13. There have been no epidemics during the three years under report, the daily number of sick being very much the same as in previous years, i.e., about 10 per cent. of the total population. Diarrh6 Superintendent and staff. 14. Major E. L. Ward, I.M.S., held the post of Superintendent of the Asylum during the year 1915 and was relieved of these duties by Captain J. F. Fleming, I.S.M.D., in January 1916, who has continued to hold charge to the end of the period under report. Mr. Moores has given every satisfaction in his duties as European Warder, since 8th December 1916, from which date he has continuously held charge of this appointment, and Lala Ram Saran Das, the Asylum Clerk, has been extremely efficient in coping with the ever increasing amount of clerical work. The Female Asylum continues under the care of the Franciscan Sisters who, as usual, have evinced the utmost devotion and care for the unfortunate inmates in their charge. JAS. F.

REPORT ON THE WORKING OF THE PUNJAB LUNATIC ASYLUM For the year 1918. Lahore : PRINTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING, PUNJAB; 1919.
No. 14257 (Home-Medl.). FROM THE HON'BLE MR. E. JOSEPH, I,C.S., Revenue Secretary to Government, Punjab, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, HOME DEPARTMENT. Dated 26th May 1919. Home. Medical. SIR, I AM directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, the statistical tables of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the year 1918, with a note by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab, and to convey the following remarks of the Lieutenant-Governor. 2. Two years ago the daily average strength of the asylum amounted to 831.27, the highest then on record. During 1918 it has risen to 876.44 or 60 in excess of the total number for whom accommodation is provided. There has thus been a certain amount of overcrowding in the male section, but it is reported never to have been acute. The maximum number of insanes confined on any one day was 904. The large number of military patients suffering from aberrations due to shell shock and similar causes goes far to account for this increase in the population, and as these are for the most part cases of rapid recovery it is not unlikely that despite the growing popularity of the institu- tion the number of inmates will tend temporarily to diminish in the immediate future. The same factor is reflected in the number of patients discharged as cured, which amounted to 201 or nearly twice the number of the year before. 3. The sums received from paying patients have declined by Rs. 557 chiefly owing to the transfer of European insanes to the Ranchi Central European Asylum. Sixteen patients were thus transferred during the year. From a report recently received from the authorities at Ranchi it appears that sufficient discrimination has not in some cases been exercised in the selection of patients for transfer, and the Lieutenant Governor hopes that care will in future be taken by District Magistrates that none but Europeans are sent to Ranchi where the accommodation is strictly limited. 4. The asylum did not escape from the ravages of the influenza epidemic. Largely owing to this scourge the daily average of sick rose from 66.75 to 82.74, while the total number of deaths was 130 compared with 103. A satisfactory feature of the year is an appreciable decrease in the admissions to hospital for tubercle. 5. Besides the improvements mentioned by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals as completed the Lieutenant-Governor has now sanctioned the acquisition of an unsightly and insanitary plot of land measuring nearly 50 acres which adjoins the asylum on the south. This will be utilized for the erection of a new block for suspected tubercle cases and possibly in due course for the construction of a separate criminal section, while the remaining area will be levelled and put under cultivation in part by asylum labour. Money has also been provided in the current year's budget for the remodelling of
2 some of the cubicular barracks and the provision of a segregation area in con- nection with the measures for the reduction of the spread of tubercle recently recommended by Lieutenant-Colonel Forster, I.M.S., in his report on the subject. 6. The number of permanent attendants of the asylum has now been increased and an all-round enhancement of the pay of the warder establishment at an additional cost of Rs. 4,878 per annum has been sanctioned. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that this substantial improvement in the con- ditions of service will result in the attraction of a suitable class of warder and that every effort will be made to employ as far as possible retired military men. 7. The Lieutenant-Governor fully endorses Colonel MacWatt's appre- ciation of the valuable work done by Captain Fleming, I.M.D., as Superinten- dent, and by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ali Gauhar Khan in combating the influ- enza epidemic in the asylum. The self-sacrificing devotion of the Franciscan Sisters in their care of the female patients cannot be too highly praised and His Honour is glad to have once more the opportunity of repeating his acknowledgments of their meritorious work. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, E. JOSEPH, Revenue Secretary to Government, Punjab. 510 CSNotes on the Statistical Tables of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the year 1918.

Proceedings of the Punjab Government (Ministry of Education) in the Home (Medical and Sanitary) Department, No. 262-S., dated 23rd May 1921 READ2 ORDER.Note on the Report of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum, Lahore, for the triennium 1918-1920. THE report forwarded herewith is for the triennial period 19182 his being relieved and proceeding on sick leave. The Asylum has lost an excellent and efficient Superintendent who spared himself in no way, and Government loses the services of a most efficient and conscientious officer. It is to be hoped that his health will benefit from the enforced rest. Mr. Teal, the European warder, and Lala Ram Saran Das, Head Clerk, have worked well and earned the approbation of the Superintendent. The Franciscan Sisters have throughout the period toiled unremittingly amongst the female patients and their zeal, devotion and self-denial are beyond all praise. Unfortunately the health of Sister Agnes has given way and she has been obliged to proceed to Europe on sick leave. R. CHARLES MACWATT, COLONEL, I.M.S., The 12th April 1921. Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Punjab.
Triennial Report on the working of the Punjab Lunatic Asylum for the years 1918, 1919, 1920. Population. 1. During the three years under review, the total population of the asylum has been 1,346, 1,217, and 1,248, respec- tively, showing a progressive increase, and an advance of 471 (391 males and 80 females) in 1918, the largest number reported in any previous triennial report. Of this number only 135 were admissions from overseas, classed as military insanes. The 1,346 total population in 1918, is the highest on record. This compared with a population of 465 in 1900, the year of the inauguration of the institution is abundant evidence of the growing popularity of the asylum. It cannot reasonably be assumed that since 1900, there has been a steady general increase of insanity in the Punjab, nay, it clearly proves on the other hand that the benefits of asylum treatment have become more widely known, and more patients are sent here, instead of as heretofore being confined in their own homes. Not only are large numbers brought by their friends or relatives, who beg for admission, but many of those who have been discharged, have voluntarily returned and sought readmission as soon as they discerned the return of early symptoms. The percentage of cures still shows a high average, viz. :2 The question of heating the wards and cells in the Hospital during the winter by steam pipes or electric heaters needs close attention, when it is remembered that a large number of patients are destructive, and will not wear any covering. The steam engine which worked the drinking water wells, has been satisfactorily replaced by two electric motors. Females. 3. The Female Asylum continues under the immediate care and control of the Franciscan Sisters, whose solicitude and devotion is beyond all praise. The popularity of this branch of the institution is steadily increasing amongst all classes. There has been some overcrowding in the European section which has already been commented on. types of insanity. 4. The largest number of admissions, falls under the heading of Mania, and accounts for 39.64 per cent. of the total number of admissions, during the triennium. Charas and other toxic drugs form 9.21 per cent. Melancholia follows with 19.44 per cent., and lastly the varieties of dementia 12.02 per cent., are the most frequent types. The characteristic features of the Punjabi insane are violence and des- tructiveness, and they are even more pronounced in the Pathan, of whom there are a very large number. With this destructiveness it is extremely difficult to keep pace in the matter of clothing and bedding. A special grant will be necessary to augment the stock of clothing and bedding sufficiently to meet urgent demands. The Attendant Staff. 5. The efficient management of an institution is due in no small measure to the reliableness of the staff. I regret to say that the present type of attendant falls far short of the standard necessary. The care of the insane is not an occupation of choice, being naturally offensive and dangerous. It would be a great boon if the services of a religious body could be secured on similar lines to the Franciscan Sisterhood in the female branch. Amusements. 6. Among the Indian patients amusements mainly consist of card play- ing. Some devote attention to the keeping of pets. The institution owns a gramophone, and a magic lantern, which are unfortunately both out of order. The shady lawns furnish ideal lolling grounds, especially during the summer months. On festive days it is customary, to engage the services of musicians and jugglers. Not infrequently musicians visit the asylum and voluntarily offer their services to play for the amusement of the patients. The ordinary diet on festive days is replaced by sweet rice and sweatmeats. Tobacco and other luxuries are provided for workers in addition to the small stipends given as a reward and incentive for good work. Dietary. 7. The asylum diet is liberal, adequate and wholesome, and is supple- mented by extras when occasion demands. Escapes. 8. There were five escapes during the period under report. In 1918 a non-criminal insane escaped from the asylum cow-shed where he was employed and is still at large. In 1919 a military non-criminal insane escaped from the quarantine enclosure, by scaling the wall, he was however, captured shortly after. In 1920 two non-criminal insanes escaped whilst employed on the asylum farm. One was captured, the other is still at large. The defaulting attendants in each case were adequately dealt with. One inmate escaped into the adjoining Jail garden and jumped into a well. He was rescued with great difficulty. The attendants who took part in the rescue have been recommended for suitable rewards.
3 Deaths from Violence. 9. There were two deaths from this cause during the triennium. When we consider the heterogeneousness of the inmates, it is astonishing that there are not many more such incidents. Assaults are, however, common among the insane. Although every care is taken to immediately place apart any dangerous insane, cases do occur, where patients known to be quiet and tractable suddenly develop a furious outburst of temper, and assault anyone near them. The two assaults noted were on these lines. In one the victim was pushed over by his assailant and sustained a fractured thigh bone, from the effects of which he died. The second case was somewhat similar. In this instance the patient received injuries to his lung occasioned by fracture of the ribs. Suicides. 10. During the period under report, there were three deaths from suicide. (1) Criminal insane Mulkraj hanged himself by means of his pyjama cord. This patient had attempted suicide on a previous occasion. (2) Non-criminal insane Mulky, an Indian Christian, committed suicide by drinking a quantity of Nitric Acid, which he procured from the asylum laboratory. (3) Criminal insane Bhola Ram belonging to a respectable family, committed suicide by taking opium, presumed to have been given him by one of his relatives during the course of an interview. In this connection it may be mentioned how futile our precautionary measures are for preventing the entry of toxic drugs through the agency of asylum servants, when it is pointed out how easy it is to introduce such drugs by simply throwing packets over the enclosure walls. Occupation. 11. The insane like the same must have something to do that will take up his attention and divert him from introspec- tive morbidness For this purpose gardening in its various forms is found to be the best. It is the only means of making the asylum a pleasant hospital. Most of the workers in the institution are employed on this special form of labour, and the asylum garden has during the period under report produced an ample supply of vegetables and condi- ments of excellent quality to meet all demands. Some of the workers select weaving or tailoring, and here I might mention that the major portion of the clothing and bedding of the institution is manufactured by them. Cost of Maintenance. 12. Although stops were taken to curtail expenditure, the cost of maintenance has greatly increased, mainly due to high price of foodstuffs and raw material. The expenditure under the head of diet, alone, amounted to Rs. 84,686, Rs. 95,762 and Rs. 1,02,574, respectively. The average cost per head was Rs. 18-10-8 per mensem or Rs. 224 per annum. The recoveries from paying patients increased by nearly a thousand rupees in 1920. The annual income under this head was Rs. 9,441, Rs. 9,169 and Rs. 10,165, respectively. If the amount thus realized be deducted from the expenditure, the cost per head is still high, viz.4 The profits from manufactures during the triennium were Rs. 11,471, Rs. 11,317 and Rs. 13,207, respectively. However, there is an outstanding of Rs. 2,500, yet to be met, on account of the purchase of blanket yarn. The profits are derived from gardening, the manufacture of blankets, and dasuti cloth, munj mats, and the sale of grass and manure. Sickness and Mortality. 13 There have been two epidemics of Influenza during the triennium. The first appeared exclusively in the male asylum in 1918. There were 135 cases with 31 deaths. In 1920 an outbreak occurred in the female asylum, during which there were 64 cases with 13 deaths. In 1919 a minor outbreak occurred in the same branch, during which there were only 16 admissions, with 3 deaths. The daily average number of sick was 82.74, 90.58, and 64.79, respec- tively. The diseases claiming the largest number of sick were as follows :STATEMENTS
