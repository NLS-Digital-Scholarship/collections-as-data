No. 433 of 1923. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE. Parel, 7th May 1923. From K. HEWLETT, ESQ., O.B.E., Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the thirty-seventh Annual Administration Report of the Bombay Veterinary College. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. Q 10ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE, FOR THE YEAR 1922-1923. Mr. K. Hewlett, the Principal of the College, held charge throughout the year under report. Mr. Sowerby, the Assistant Principal and Khan Sahebs Dhakmarvala and Shaikh and Messrs. Miranda and Nair continued to hold charge of their appoint- ments. Mr. V. R. Phadke, Second Assistant Professor, was placed on deputation from 6th July, 1922 to undergo a course of Post Graduate training at Muktesar. Mr. J. M. C. Rebello, Chief Veterinary Inspector of the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department, was appointed to perform Mr. Phadke's duties in addition to his own as a temporary measure. 2. The Students.4 6. Of the 66 students on the rolls at the commencement of the first session (August) 4 students discontinued the course. Consequently there were 62 students' names on the rolls at the end of the year as against 67 at the commencement of the year. 7. There were 17 scholarships vacant on 1st August 1922, viz., 15 for youths from the Presidency proper and 2 for youths from Sind. These vacancies were due to the scholarships not having been sufficiently attractive on account of high cost of living to induce suitable students to come forward in the previous years. There were no less than 12 vacancies from this cause. The remaining vacancies were due to one student having graduated and left the college and to 2 students having failed and thus forfeited their scholarships. Of the 17 vacancies it was decided to withhold 9 (8 for Presidency proper and one for Sind) as a matter of economy during this year of financial difficulty. The remaining 8 vacancies were available for scholars but the Principal was only able to award 2, as suitable candidates were not forthcoming5 13. Clinical Instruction.6 17.

17 No. 3656 of 1923. From E. S. FARBROTHER, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 29th June 1923. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1922-23. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Offg. Superintendent, C.V.D., Bombay Presidency. Q 1019 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1922-23. Mr. E. S. Farbrother held charge of the Department through- out the year. He was on tour for 96 days and travelled 7,817 miles by rail and 623 by road. He visited 13 districts and inspected 29 dispensaries and 12 stallion stands. He served as a Member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1922 and conducted the supple- mentary examination at the ame college in December 1922. He appeared as a witness before the Retrenchment Committee in December and attende the Veterinary Conference held at Calcutta in February and March 1923. At the request of the Secretary, Dharwar District Co-operative Conference, he acted as a Member of the Judging Committee at the Cattle Show held at Aminbhavi in Dharwar District in March 1923. At Head-Quarters, he on various occasions inspected horses under the Glanders and Farcy Act and passed necessary orders as a "Practitioner". 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy continued to hold the post of Deputy Superinten lent and Personal Assistant to the Superinten- dent throughout the year. He was on tour for 32 days and travelled 2,822 miles by rail and 163 miles by road. He acted as a Member of the Cattle Breed- ing Committee and toured in this connection in Ahmedabad, Kaira and Surat districts. He visited the Bombay Pinjrapoles as usual and advised the Pinjrapole Authorities on Veterinary Matters. Owing to the necessity of economy, the Superintendent's and Deputy Superintendent's tours were restricted as much as possible during the year. I.20 due to the fact that Rinderpest was less prevalent during the year under report and probably to a certain extent to the better reporting of outbreaks. During the year 1,848 outbreaks were reported to Veterinary Assistants and 1,864 were actually attended by them as against 2,243 last year. Veterinary Inspectors attended 83 outbreaks. Equine Contagious Disease. 5. Thirty-one cases of Glanders were reported, 29 occurring in Bombay City and 2 in Poona. In the preceding year 56 cases were reported from Bombay City and 16 from Poona. Surra was detected in Bombay City and Thana, West Khandesh and Ahmedabad districts. Sixty-nine equines were either destroyed on account of this disease under the Glanders and Farcy Act or died before action could be taken. Nine cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis were reported from Bombay City. Bovine Contagious Disease. 6. Rinderpest was reported from all districts except East Khandesh and Belgaum. The disease was not so widely prevalent as in the previous year and occurred very sporadically. At no period of the year was there any sign of a widespread outbreak. The reported mortality was 4,767 against 10,593 in the previous year. Ratnagiri, Kolaba and Ahmedabad districts were chiefly affected, three-fourth of the mortality occurring in these three districts. Belgaum District has been free of this disease for the past two years. 7. Foot and Mouth disease was reported from all districts 52,096 animals were reported to have been affected and 364 died mostly calves. The disease was prevalent practically throughout the year. Kolaba District suffered heavily, 11,956 attacks being reported. During October and November a severe outbreak occurred but as it was well reported, it was fairly quickly got under control with the help of reserves who were drafted into the district for the purpose. 8. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia was reported from all districts with the exception of East-Khandesh. Bombay City was also reported free of this disease. Two thousand onr hundred and eighty- three deaths were reported among 2,715 attacks as against 2,469 deaths reported in the previous year. Owing to restricted touring, it was not possible to carry out propaganda work in connection with vaccination against this disease to the extent that was proposed. 9. Black-Quarter was reported from 12 districts, and Satara, Ahmednagar, Poona and Bijapur suffered heavily. There was a considerable increase in mortality from this disease, 3,167 deaths being reported against 222 last year, the late rains being responsible for the increase. Three hundred and seventeen outbreaks were attended and of these 30 were confirmed by the microscope.
21 10. Anthrax was reported to be the cause of 766 deaths among cattle during the year compared with 1,096 reported in the pre ous year. Of 92 outbreaks reported and attended 7 were confirmed. Ratnagiri and Kanara Districts were chiefly affected. 11. Bovine Trypanosomiasis was reported from West Khandesh District and confirmed. Contagious Diseases in other animals. 12. Two outbreaks of suspected Anthrax in sheep and goats were reported from Ahmednagar district and they were reported to the Wool Exporters Association, Bombay. The outbreaks were reported too late for either clinical or Bacteriological confirmation. Contagious Pieuro-pneumonia among sheep and goats was reported from Ahmedabad and East-Khandesh districts, but was not confirmed. Rinderpest among sheep and goats was reported from Ahmed- nagar district. Sixty-five cases of Babies in dogs were dealt with by the Veterinary Staff as against 58 last year. The brains of 30 dogs suspected to be. suffering from this disease were sent to the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory for examination. Preventive Measures. Table III. 13. Ten thousand three hundred and seventy-four cattle were protected against Rinderpest by the " Serum alone " method, in 93 out- breaks. In these outbreaks 1,800 un-inoculated and 146 inoculated animals are reported to have died. 14. Three thousand two hundred and sixty-three cattle were inoculated against Hæmorrnagic Septicæmia with protective serum in 35 outbreaks and 915 were protected by vaccination in six villages. During the course of the outbreaks in which inoculations were performed 410 un-inoculated and nine inoculated animals died. 15. In 14 outbreaks of Anthrax 857 animals were protected by serum. No deaths occurred among the inoculated animals but 126 un-inoculated are reported to have died from this disease. 16. One hundred and twenty-five animals were protected by vaccination against Black-Quarter in one village. One death among the vaccinated was reported. 17. This year Rs. 619-14-0 were recovered as fees for inocula- tion against Hæmorrnagic Septicæmia and Anthrax and for vaccina- tion against Hæmorrnagic Septicæmia. 18. There is a reduction in the number of inoculations performed against Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. This is due to the fact that these diseases were not so prevalent as in the previous year, only 252 outbreaks of Rinderpest and 217 of Hæmorr- hagic Septicæmia being reported against 699 and 291 respectively last year.
22 Other diseases. Table IV. 19. The Number of villages visited by 80 Veterinary Assist- ants was 2,363 against 4,319, the reduction being due to restricted tour- ing. During their tours, the Veterinary Assistants treated 31,427 cases for contagious diseases, chiefly Foot and Mouth disease, Rinder- pest and Black-Quarter, and 3,790 for non-contagious diseases. One thousand and sixty-two castrations were performed as against 621 last year. Attempts are being made to popularise castration by the Burdizzo Castrator. The advantages of this method are that the operation involves no incision and no after-treatment. So far the experiment has been fairly successful in the Dharwar Division, especially in the Bijapur District where the Collector, Mr. C. G. Henderson, I.C.S. has done much to assist the Department in this respect. Most District Local Boards have agreed to purchase one of these instruments and they will be supplied as they are received in this country. Investigation. 20. During the year 380 specimens were sent by the staff to the Sir D. M. Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination and six for the College Museum. Specimens of Infective Nasal Granuloma and diseased muscles from cases of Black-Quarter were submitted to the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory Muktesar for investigation and research. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 21. No new dispensaries were opened during the year under report. There were 80 working at the beginning of the year, but Malvan Dispensary in Ratnagiri District was closed from 1st October and Pen and Ashtami Dispensaries in the Kolaba district from 1st March 1923, owing to the District Local Boards being unable to meet the extra expenditure which would fall on them as a result of the reduction in the Government Grants-in-aid. The opening of several new dispensaries was also deferred for want of Government assistance. There were, therefore, only 77 dispensaries at work at the close of the year. One hundred thousand nine hundred and forty-seven cases were treated at the dispensaries as against 1,04,324 last year and medicines were supplied to 47,136 cases for home treatment against 61,675 last year. The reduction is attributable to the general healthier conditions which prevailed during the year. A Veterinary Assistant was deputed to the Dangs in the Surat district for two months in order to give Veterinary aid to the people and to control cattle diseases. The complete report of his work is not at present to hand, but it appears that there is a great necessity of a permanent Veterinary Assistant being posted to this area.
23 22. The constructing of permanent buildings for Veterinary Dispensaries proceeds very slowly. During the year the dispensaries at Baramati and Pandharpur were completed with the help of grants from the Wadia Bequest Fund. By the generosity of Mr. D. P. Alur, who contributed about Rs. 6,000 towards the work, the District Local Board, Kanara, were able to complete the Sirsi Dispensary. At Alibag the main building, consisting of dispensary room, office and godown, was completed and the construction of new buildings has been started at Kumpta by the District Local Board, Kanara. III.24 two died and Senior Veterinary Assistant V. N. Kulkarni was promoted to the rank of Veterinary Inspector to fill the vacancy caused by the death from plague of Mr. A. D. Lopez, Veterinary Inspector, Dharwar Division, in December 1922. Two new Veterinary Assistants were appointed during the year, making the total number employed at the end of the year 95.

39 No. P.40 District Local Board bull covered 107 cows against 103 covered by two bulls. Willingdon Cattle Farm. 9. The control of the Willingdon Cattle Farm was transferred to the Deputy Director of Agriculture for Animal Breeding, Bombay Presi- dency, under Government Resolution No. A.-430, dated the 31st January 1923. Financial. 10. The total expenditure of the department amounted to Rs. 1,63,489 as against Rs. 1,86,643. General remarks. 11. Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, has been granted an extension of service up to the 31st March 1924. The question of the appointment of Veterinary Inspectors in Sind has been deferred pending his retirement. 12. Constant touring is essential if a headway is to be made against cattle disease. The villages where inoculations have been carried out are beginning to report diseases and five Veterinary Graduates have each inoculated 1,000 cases. Moreover, the villagers want to see and to know the Veterinary Assistant. It is the same with plague inoculation. A doctor they know has far more appli- cations than a new man. 13. In a purely agricultural tract like Sind, the improvement of the breed of cattle is important. It is of little use to leave this to Local Boards, a scheme which has been tried for 30 years with little progress to its credit. Where there is abundance of irrigated crops and kadbi is the best in the Presidency and is rich in dietetic values as any Officer Commanding a Battery will admit, there should be as fine a breed of agricultural cattle here as anywhere. It is hoped that money will be found to push on cattle breeding. Horse breeding has been tried in Sind for thirty years and over, to the Commissioner's knowledge, and little success has been achieved. Norfolk Trotters were introduced to bring bone, with disastrous and amorphous results: then English thoroughbreds twice the size of the Sindhi mares. We need to breed 14.2's. A 16 2½ stallion like Opal stationed at Umarkot in 1894 is not wanted. The Commissioner has known of a country bred stallion of a great reputation, privately owned, which the Larkana zamindars patronised from enormous distances and a, wise purchase of a good country bred stallion will be popular. Arabs are not much liked. Good country bred stallions, when they can be found, will enable some real progress to be made ; they will be cheaper to buy and far more popular than the present costly stallions and are as hardy as could be wished.

Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the thirty-eighth Annual Administration Report of the Bombay Veterinary College. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. Q 3ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1923-1924. Mr. K. Hewlett, the Principal of the College, held charge upto the 31st July 1923 when he proceeded on five months' leave and Mr. M. H. Sowerby, the Assistant Principal, assumed charge. Mr. Hewlett returned from leave and took over on 22nd December 1923 afternoon and remained in charge until the end of the year. Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala, 1st Professor, acted as Assistant Principal during the time Mr. Sowerby acted as Principal. Khan Sahib Shaikh Ahmed and Mr. Miranda continued to hold charge of their appointments throughout the year. Mr. V. R. Phadke, 2nd Assist- ant Professor, who was on deputation to undergo a course of Post- Graduate training at Muktesar, returned to duty, after having completed the course, on 1st January 1924. Mr. J. M. C. Rebello, Chief Inspector of the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department, continued to perform Mr. Phadke's duty during his absence. Mr. K. B. Nair, the lecturer, was appointed to act as Assistant Professor during the vacancy caused by Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala's acting as Assistant Principal. 2. The Students.4 17 passed. The percentages this year therefore for the three classes were 80.00, 80.00 and 80.95 respectively as against 64.29, 68.18 and 6818 last year or the total of 80.32 as against 67.24 last year. 6. Of the 69 students on the rolls at the commencement of the first session (August) 4 students discontinued the course. Conse- quently there were 65 students' names on the rolls at the end of the year as against 62 at the commencement of the year. 7. There were 9 scholarships vacant on 1st August 1923, viz., 8 for youths from the Presidency proper and 1 for youths from Sind. Of the 8 vacancies from the Presidency proper one was due to a scholar having graduated in April 1923 and 7 were vacant since previous years as the amount of scholarship was then insufficient to induce suitable candidates to come forward. The vacancy from Sind was due to a scholar having left the College after graduation. The Principal awarded 7 scholarships. The Commissioner in Sind did not send any scholar. In all there were 13 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 6 already studying in the College) and 5 from Sind (i.e., those who were awarded scholarships in former years). The C. P. Government continued stipend to one scholar and sent 3 more scholars. Mysore State continued stipends to 6 students already in the College. His Exalted Highness the Nizam's Government continued stipends to 3 students and Gwalior State continued stipends to 2 scholars already in the College and sent one more scholar.

17 No. 8316 of 1924. From KHAN SAHEB J. D. BUXY, Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 28th June 1924. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1923-24. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. D. BUXY, Acting Superintendent, C.V.D., Bombay Presidency. Q 319 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. Mr. E. S. Farbrother held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year, with the exception of the month of February 1924, when he was on leave owing to sickness and Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, acted as Superin- tendent in addition to his own duties. Mr. Farbrother was on tour for 87 days and travelled 3,397 miles by rail and 1,114 miles by road. He visited 10 districts and inspected 31 dispensaries and selected sites and buildings for 4 dispensaries and examined horses for Glanders and Farcy in Poona. lie was unable to tour in March owing to illness. He also served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1923 and conducted the Supplementary Examination at the same College in December 1923. He presided at the opening ceremony of the Veterinary Dispen- sary building at Kumta and visited Vaccine Institute at Belgaum during the course of his tour. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy as acting Superintendent was on tour for 8 days and travelled 890 miles by rail, and 50 miles by road. He visited one district and selected buildings for two new Veterinary Dispensaries. 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superin- tendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, throughout the year. He was on tour for 65 days and travelled 6,151 miles by rail, 339 miles by road and 40 miles by sea. He visited 6 districts and inspected 7 Veterinary Dispensaries and 2 stallion stands. He selected sites and buildings for 3 Veterinary Dispensaries. As usual he visited the Bombay Pinjrapoles and advised the Pinjrapole authorities on veterinary matters. He attended the outbreaks of Epizootic Limphangitis, Foot and Mouth and Rinderpest at Chembur and Bhiwandi Pinjrapoles and inspected the horses under Glanders and Farcy Act at several places. He attended the conference of the Graduates of the Bombay Veterinary College held at Surat in the month of March 1924 under the Presidentship of the Honourable Khan Bahadur Shaikh Ghulam Husain Hidayatallah, Minister of Local Self-Government. I.20 II.21 attacks and 2,847 deaths from this disease as against 2,715 attacks and 2,183 deaths recorded in the last year. The disease was more severe in Satara, Belgaum and Dharwar Districts and was compara- tively lesser in the Gujarat except in Kaira District owing to insufficient rainfall. 9. Black Quarter outbreaks were reported from 13 districts with a total mortality of 2,043 as against 3,167 deaths reported last year. Ahmednagar and Poona Districts were more affected than other districts but the percentage of mortality was far higher in the Poona District being 96 per cent. than in the Ahmednagar District which was 72 per cent. Diagnosis was microscopically confirmed in 31 outbreaks out of 217 attended. 10. Anthrax was reported from 12 districts, and 491 animals were reported to have succumbed to this disease as compared with 766 deaths during the last year. The disease was confirmed microscopically in 12 outbreaks out of the 91 attended. 11. Other contagious diseases in bovines include Dengue and Bovine Piroplasmosis. The former was reported from Ahmednagar, Poona, Satara, Belgaum, Kanara and Kolaba Districts and the latter was detected in the Kanara District. Contagious Diseases in other Animals. 12. Rinderpest, Anthrax, Foot and Mouth Disease, contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia and Variola were reported in sheep and goats, from Ahmedabad, Broach, Ahmednagar, West Khandesh, Bijapur, Dharwar and Kanara Districts. Surra in camels was reported from the Broach District and fowl cholera from the Thana District. Ninety cases of Rabies in dogs were dealt with by the Veterinary staff as against sixty-five last year. The brains of forty dogs suspected to be suffering from this disease were sent to the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory for examination. Preventive Measures. Table III. 13. During the year under report 14,854 inoculations were carried out against Rinderpest by the " Serum alone" method in 144 out- breaks against 10,374 in the preceding year in 93 outbreaks. In the outbreaks in which inoculation was performed 2,537 uninoculated animals and 112 inoculated animals were reported to have died. 14. In 89 outbreaks of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia 8,598 cattle were inoculated against the disease with protective serum as against 3,262 in the last year. In eight villages 1,143 animals were vaccinated against this disease as against 915 animals in 6 villages in the previous year. Among the inoculated animals there were 11 deaths only, while the mortality among uninoculated animals amounts to 1,433 during the course of the disease. 15. Five hundred and two animals were protected by Anti- Anthrax Serum in eight outbreaks, with three deaths among the
22 inoculated animals and sixty-eight among the uninoculated animals. 16. Arrangements have now been made with the Director, Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar, to supply a filtrate and a potent serum to protect cattle against Black Quarter, which will be carried out during the next year on receipt and the results carefully watched. 17. During the year Rs. 1,142-15-0 were recovered as fees for inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Anthrax and for vaccination against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia as against Rs. 619-14-0 recovered in the preceding year. 18. The inoculations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Anthrax and vaccinations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia are gaining increasing confidence of the cattle owners which is notice- able from the increase in the number thus protected and the amount of fees realised. Although people are generally unwilling to pay for inoculation fees, still in view of the loss of their live-stock, some of the intelligent and educated people prefer to take the advantage of protective measures on payment of fees. Other Diseases. Table IV. 19. The number of villages visited by 83 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was 2,785 against 2,363 by 80 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons last year. During their tours they treated 29,389 animals for con- tagious diseases, and 6,881 for non-contagious diseases. Five thou- sand three hundred and seventeen castrations were performed during the year against 1,062 during the previous year. As stated in the last year's report attempts were made to popularise castration by the Burdizzo Castrator. Almost all the District Local Boards have indented for at least one in their District as an experimental measure and Bijapur, Dharwar, Belgaum and Thana have purchased more than one. The District Local Boards of Ahmedabad, Panch-Mahals, Sholapur and Ratnagiri, and Bandra Municipality, however, have not yet purchased any. It is a pity that these Bodies have not been able to introduce this most humane and efficient instrument, which has given such a wide satisfaction. Castrations by this method are becoming very popular and the number of castrations have increased considerably, particularly in the Bijapur District, where the Collector Mr. C. G. Henderson, I.C.S., has continued to take special interest in this direction. This method of castration is being pushed on with vigour and have taken a firm hold on the people, because it causes no pain and requires no after-treat- ment. Investigation. 20. During the year under report 245 specimens were sent by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to Sir D. M. Petit, Patho- Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, for examination and two for the College museum.
23 Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 21. Six new Veterinary Dispensaries were opened during the year, viz., Vagra in the Broach District, Kapadvanj in Kaira District, Naval- gund and Nargund in the Dharwar District, Hungund in the Bijapur District and Karmala in the Sholapnr District. Including the new dispensaries the number at work at the end of the year was 83 against 77 dispensaries at the close of the last year. The number of cases treated was 100,576 against 100,947 and medicines were supplied to 40,958 cases for home treatment against 47,136 cases last year. The decrease is due to shortage of rains which has caused less number of fly-blown and wound cases. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was deputed during the year to the Dangs in the Surat District in order to give Veterinary aid to the people and to control cattle diseases. It appears from his report that there is ample field for Veterinary work in this area and there is a great need of a permanent Veterinary Assistant Surgeon being posted to the Dangs, at least during the fair weather. 22. The construction of permanent buildings for Veterinary Dispensaries progresses very slowly. It is, however, a matter for gratification that people appreciate the necessity of Veterinary treatment and contribute for the construction of Dispensary build- ings. The construction of new buildings started at Kumta by the District Local Board, Kanara, last year with the help of popular contributions was completed and the new building " The Premabai Veterinary Dispensary" was opened on 22nd October 1923. Simi- larly the Italva Dispensary has been removed to Eru Four Roads in Jalalpur Taluka and a building with three rooms was cons- tructed at a cost of about Rs. 7,500 by Mr. R. K. Rasoia for the Veterinary Dispensary at Eru and Mr. Gulabbhai of Eru purchased the site for Rs. 2,400 for the dispensary. In addition to these, the District Local Board, Kaira, has secured a donation of Rs. 8,000 for the Kapadvanj Veterinary Dispensary. A sum of about Rs. 1,000 was collected by local subscriptions to help the Veterinary Dispensary at Vagra in Broach District for the construction of an in-patient shed. The Ahmedabad District Local Board, also, secured a donation of Rs. 6,000 for the Veterinary Dispensary building at Dhanduka. III.24 Local Boards, Ahmednagar and Sholapur, and 1 pony stallion was returned to his owner, as the Horse Breeding operations were discontinued by Government. Table XI. 25. During the year 740 mares were covered as against 1,154 in the previous year, the average per stallion being 39.56 against 43.36. The reduction is accounted for by there being fewer stallions at stud and the Horse Breeding operations being practically discon- tinued since December 1923. Table XII. 26. The average cost of maintenance per stallion was Rs. 706 against 746 last year. (ii) Donkey Stallions. 27 There is no mule breeding carried on in this Presidency. (3) Others. 28.

His place has been filled up by the Second clerk Mr. C. T. Udas, whose work is found quite satisfactory. Government have been pleased to change the designation of the Subordinate staff from "Veterinary Assistant" to "Veterinary Assistant Surgeon", which has been highly appreciated by the members of the service. Government have been further pleased to revise the scale of pay of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, converting the Junior and Senior grades from Rs. 65-3-95, and Rs. 100-3-130, into a continuous time scale of Rs. 60-4-140 with efficiency bar at Rs. 100.

41 No. P.42 General remarks. 10. Khan Bahadur S. G. Haji, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, proceeded on six months' leave on 1st March 1924, pre- paratory to retirement. The post he held has been abolished, and two appointments of Veterinary Inspectors have been sanctioned by Government. Khan Bahadur Haji's retirement is a loss to the Department, in which he has served for 32 years. His knowledge and experience of Veterinary matters in Sind were unequalled, and he possessed in a special degree the confidence of the people. J. L. RIEU, Commissioner in Sind.

There were 11 scholarships vacant on the 1st of August 1924, viz., 7 for youths from the Presidency proper and 4 for youths from Sind. Of the 7 vacancies from the Presidency proper 3 were due to 3 scholars having graduated in April 1924 and 3 were due to scholar- ships having been withdrawn, as the students failed to pass their examinations and one had been vacant since the previous year The 4 vacancies from Sind were due to 3 scholars having left the College after graduation and one had been vacant since last year. The Commissioner in Sind did not send any new scholar but awarded a scholarship to a student already studying in the. College. The savings effected on account of the 3 vacant scholarships was utilized to award scholarships to candidates coming from the Presidency proper. The Principal therefore was able to award 12 scholarships to students from the Presidency proper. There were in all 19 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 7 already studying in the College) and 3 from Sind. The Central Provinces Government continued stipends to 3 scholars, Mysore State continued stipends to 3 scholars already in the College, His Exalted Highness the Nizam's Government continued stipends to 3 scholars and Gwalior State continued stipends to 3 scholars.

FARBROTHER, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 29th June 1925. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1921-25. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency. Q 519 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. Mr. E. S. Farbrother held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, from 1st to 24th April 1924, when he proceeded on seven months' leave. Daring his absence, Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, acted as Superinten- dent. Mr. Farbrother resumed charge of his office on return from leave on 26th November 1924 and continued to hold it till the end of the year. Mr. Farbrother was on tour for 54 days and travelled 3,895 miles by rail and 337 miles by road. He visited 10 Districts once or twice, inspected fourteen dispensaries, and attended the seen s of several outbreaks of contagious diseases in the Kanara, Dharwar and Poona Districts. He also served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1924 and March 1925. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy, as acting Superintendent was on tour for 53 days and travelled 6,511 miles by rail and 469 miles by road. He visited nine Districts, inspected 21 Dispensaries and selected building sites for two Veterinary Dispensaries. He attended out- breaks of disease at several places and checked the inoculation work done by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. He visited the Bombay Pinjrapoles as usual and advised the authorities on Veterinary matters and also visited the Pinjrapole famine camps in Ahmelabad District. He inspected some stables in the Thana District in connection with Surra. 2. The post of Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent was held by Khan Saheb J. D Buxy from 1st to 24th April 1924. From 25th April to 25th May, he carried out the duties of this post in addition to his own of acting Superin- tendent and then handed over charge to Rao Saheb P. D. Maniar. On the return of Mr. E. S. Farbrother from leave, he reverted to his substantive post and held charge up to the end of the year. He was on leave from January 3rd to January 17th 1925, and during his absence, his duties were performed by the Superintendent. Rao Saheb P. D.

During this period, he was on tour for 27 days and travelled 1,397 miles by rail and 78 miles by road. He visited three Districts and inspected 8 Veterinary Dispensaries. Both the above officers, carried out their duties as Acting Superintendent and acting Deputy Superintendent well during the absence on leave of the Superintendent.
20 I.21 report. At the close of the previous year, the disease was existing in a more or less sporadic form and it continued in this way during the early months of this year. It began to spread later on in a more virulent form in certain Districts, however, until practically the whole of the Dharwar, Nasik, East and West Khandesh Districts and large tracts in Kanara, Belgaum, Kolaba and Thana Districts were severely affected. The disease reached its height in October and November, after which it gradually declined until February, when a slight increase in severity again occurred. Towards the end of the year however, it was again on the decline, the number of new outbreaks reported showing a great decrease. In the whole of the Presidency Proper 1,950 villages were reported to have suffered from this disease. 77,478 attacks and 36,564 deaths were reported as compared with 5,166 deaths reported last year. Dharwar District suffered most heavly, having a total mortality of 10,347. Nasik recorded 5,947, Kanara 3,978 and Kolaba 2,906 deaths. 8. Foot and Mouth Disease. This disease did not occur to the extent reported last year. Outbreaks occurred in all Districts of the Presidency but Kanara and Dharwar probably suffered most, the disease occurring at the same time as Rinderpest Twenty-four thousand three hundred and eighty-four cases and 199 deaths were reported against 51,412 cases and 348 deaths reported last year. Kanara and Dharwar each reported over 4,000 attacks and Poona, Kolaba, Sholapur, Nasik, Ahmedabad and Ahmednagar were also severely affected. The mortality was highest in Ratnagiri, Kanara and Thana Districts and in Bombay City. 9. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. This disease also was not so widespread as in the previous year, although reports were received from all districts except Ahmednagar, East Khandesh and Bijapur. Two thousand three hundred and fifty cases were reported with 1,584 deaths. In the previous year 3,528 cases with 2,847 deaths were reported. The mortality was highest in Kolaba, Dharwar, Belgaum, Broach, Satara and Surat Districts. The disease was confirmed microscopically in 25 outbreaks. 10. Black Quarter was reported from Thana, Ahmednagar, West Khandesh, Nasik, Poona, Satara, Sholapur, Belgaum, Bijapur, Dharwar and Ratnagiri Districts. It was not so widespread as in the previous year, except in the Ahmednagar District, where 124 attacks and 110 deaths were reported. The total number of deaths reported from Black Quarter was 233 as against 2,043 in the year 1923-24. 11. Anthrax. Anthrax was more prevalent than in the last year, 1,226 deaths being reported from this cause against 491. The disease was reported from 14 Districts, Ratnagiri, Kanara and Ahmednagar suffering most as usual. Anthrax was confirmed microscopically in 23 outbreaks,
22 12. Other contagious diseases reported to have occurred in Bovines include Dengue and Piroplasmosis. The former occurred in Ahmedabad, Kaira, Panch-Mahals, Ahmednagar, Poona, Belgaum, Bijapur and Kanara Districts. Piroplasmosis was confirmed in Belgaum, Kanara and Ratnagiri Districts. This disease was detected in combination with Rinderpest among calves affected with the latter disease at the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. Contagious Diseases in other Animals. 13. Foot and Mouth Disease in Sheep and Goats was reported from Satara, Belgaum and Dharwar Districts. Variola from Ahmedabad, Broach, Kanara and Ratnagiri Districts and contagious pleuropneumonia from Ahmedabad District. Anthrax in Sheep was reported from Ahmednagar and Nasik Districts. Sixty-seven cases of rabies were dealt with by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, as against 90 last year. The brains of HO dogs suspected to have died from this disease were sent to the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory for examination. Preventive Measures. Table III. 14. Preventive inoculation against Rinderpest was undertaken in 975 outbreaks of the 1,950 reported to, and attended by, the staff. 117,358 animals were protected in this way against 14,854 last year. In the 975 outbreaks in which Anti-rinderpest inoculations were performed, 15,920 deaths occurred among uninoculated animals and only 354 among the inoculated. The large increase in the number of Anti-rinderpest inoculations performed is due to the very widespread prevalence of the disease. 15. Five thousand three-hundred and fifty-seven animals were protected against Hemorrhagic Septicæmia by the Serum alone method in 53 outbreaks, as compared with 8,598 inoculations in 89 outbreaks in the previous year. The reduction in the number of inoculations performed against this disease is due to the fact that the disease was not so prevalent as in the year 1923-24. In the villages in which inoculations were performed 9 inoculated animals and 879 uninoculated died of Hemorrhagic Septicemia. One thousand two-hundred and seventy-five animals were vaccinated with Hemorrhagic Septicemia Vaccine in 9 villages as compared with 1,143 vaccinations in 8 villages last year. This form of preventing the occurrence of the disease has not yet attained the popularity it deserves, the reason being that the agriculturists are very loath to undertake any preventive measures until disease actually appears in their herds. The fact that inoculations and vaccinations against this disease have to be paid for also puts them against it, but the Department is endeavouring to overcome their objections by means of propaganda. 16. In 13 outbreaks of Anthrax 1,522 animals were protected with anti-anthrax serum. Nine inoculated and 139 uninoculated animals died.
23 17. During the year under report inoculations against Black- Quarter by means of serum and also germ free filtrate were intro- duced. The former is used in actual outbreaks and confers on the inoculated animals a short immunity sufficient to protect them during the outbreak. The latter confers a more lasting immunity, but the immunity conferred is not set up immediately and so it is not used in an actual outbreak, except in conjunction with serum. The Department is endeavouring to induce agriculturists who live in tracts where this disease occurs almost every year, to have their cattle protected in this way before the Black-Quarter season sets in, so that their cattle may be immune to the disease during that part of the year. Unfortunately this could not be done during the year, but 296 combined inoculations and 95 serum alone inoculations were performed. No deaths occurred among the inoculated animals and the results of the initial attempts may be considered as satisfactory. The serum and germ free filtrate were manufactured and supplied by the Muktesar Laboratory. 18. As usual charges were made for inoculations and vaccinations against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Anthrax, and a sum of Rs. 1,189-9-0 was recovered as fees. Last year Rs. 1,142-15-0 were recovered and credited to Government. Other Diseases. Table IV. 19. During the year, the members of the staff visited 4,55 L villages and during the course of their tours, they treated 23.034 animals for contagious diseases and 13,004 for non-contagious diseases, and 10,818 castrations were performed. In the previous year 2,785 villages were visited, 29,389 cases were treated for contagious diseases, 6,881 for non-contagious diseases, and 5,317 castrations were performed. There is a reduction in the number of cases treated for contagious diseases, owing to the fact that Foot and Mouth Disease, Hæemorrhagic Septicæmia and Black-Quarter were not so prevalent as in the past year. Investigation. 20. Two-hundred and sixty-six specimens were sent to the Sir, D. M. Petit Patho-bacteriological Laboratory, Parel by Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons for examination. Some specimens were also sent for the College Museum. Veterinary Departments. Table V. 21. At the beginning of the year there were 83 dispensaries working in the Presidency proper, and during the year six new ones were opened, viz., one each at Chikhli and Olpad in Surat District, Jamner and Chopda in East Khandesh District, Tasgaon in Satara District and Dohad in Panch Mahals District, making a total of 89 at the close of the year. The District Local Board, East Khandesh were
24 anxious to open more, but as their applications for grants-in-aid and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were received late in the year, it was impossible to assist them further. Most of the new dispensaries are doing very useful work already. The number of cases treated at Hospitals and Dispensaries numbered 115,144 against 100,576 last year and medicines were supplied for 45,636 cases for home treatment, 40,958 being treated in this way during the previous year. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was again deputed for two months to the Dangs in the Surat District. The period which he spends there is all too short for the work to be done. The estab- lishment of a full time dispensary, partly itinerating in this area should receive consideration. 22. The construction of suitable buildings for housing Veterinary Dispensaries proceeds very slowly. During the year under report, the District Local Board, Kaira purchased a building for the dispensary at Kapadvani and will undertake necessary additions and alterations in due course. The stallion stand at Dhanduka which was handed over to the District Local Board, Ahmedabad, for the purpose of converting it into a dispensary, has been extended for this purpose and will shortly be occupied.

43 No. P.44 General remarks. 10. Although the reported mortality among all animals exceeded last year's figure, the year was a much more favourable one for cattle than its immediate predecessors. The two most dangerous diseases of cattle, rinder- pest and hæmorrhagic septicæmia, accounted for only 988 deaths this year as against over three thousand in the previous year. It is satisfactory to note the improvement in the working of the department consequent on the substitution of two Inspectors for the former Deputy Superintendent. With reference to his remarks regarding the defective reporting of outbreaks of disease by the tapedars, the Superintendent is being asked to submit definite proposals for a system of rewards after obtaining particulars of the system adopted in the Punjab. The Commissioner concurs in Mr. Jerrom's remarks as to the desirability of supplying funds to aid the Local oards in purcha- sing stallions both to replace existing animals and in order to extend breeding operations. J. L. RIEU, Commissioner in Sind. To The Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay.
45 No. 1065-G.-IV.46 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, IN SIND, FOE THE YEAR 1924-25. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, throughout the year under report. He inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries and District Local Board stallions and when possible attended outbreaks of contagious disease. He visited the Karachi Panjrapole and the Municipal Bullock stables on several occasions. He attended and judged the Jacobabad Horse and Pony Show. He was on tour in Sind for 73 days and travelled 3,822 miles by rail and 314 miles by road. In addition, he remained six days on tour in Rajputana and travelled 1,098 miles by rail and 26 miles by road. I.47 (ii) Bovine Contagious Disease. 9. Rinderpest.48 18. Other Contagious Diseases.49 III.50 30. The two Veterinary Assistant Surgeons under training last year were promoted to the Inspectors' posts from 1st April and they joined their duties at the beginning of May. The Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind, with head-quarters at Sukkur, was 109 days on tour and travelled 2,558 miles by rail and 422 miles by road. The Veterinary Inspector, Lower Sind Circle, Karachi, was 124 days on tour and travelled 4,097 miles by rail and 734 miles by road. The Inspectors, in addition to inspection of dispensaries every quarter, did good work in the district both in attending outbreaks of disease and in checking the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 31. Proposals were submitted for the appointment of a third Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and this has since been sanctioned. 32. Both the clerical and subordinate Veterinary staff worked well during the year. Owing to the large increase in the number of returns to be submitted, the office work has greatly increased and the necessity of an additional clerk is keenly felt. V.51 reported, but as compared with recent years, 1924-25 has been a good one for cattle in Sind. 37. The reporting of contagious disease still leaves much to be desired and in the majority of cases, reports of outbreaks are conveyed to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by the cattle-owners themselves. In many cases, intimation of the outbreak is only given when there has been a large number of deaths. If Tapedars could only be persuaded to report immediately outbreaks of conta- gious disease, the mortality, in many instances, could be greatly reduced. A system of rewards for Tapedars who do good work in the reporting of contagious disease is worthy of consideration. This system is, it is understood, working satisfactorily in the Punjab and might be tried, as an experimental measure, in Sind. 38. The following Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have done good work during the year :53 TABLE II. Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1924-25. District.

Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Fortieth Annual Administration Report of the Bombay Veterinary College, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. Q 24ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1925-26. Mr. K. Hewlett, the Principal of the College, remained in charge throughout the year under report. Mr. V. R. Phadke continued to officiate as Professor of Veterinary Science till the close of the year vice Mr. M. H. Sowerby on leave preparatory to retirement. Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala, Khan Sahib Shaikh Ahmed and Mr. Miranda remained in charge of their appointments and Mr. K. B. Nair continued to act as Assistant Professor in the vacancy caused by Mr. Phadke's acting as Professor of Veterinary Science. Khan Sahib Shaikh Ahmed was on leave on average pay for one month with effect from 15th October 1925. 2. The Students.4 7. There were 5 scholarships vacant on 15th of June 1925, all for students coming from Sind. No scholarships were vacant for youths coming from the Presidency proper. Of the 5 vacancies from Sind 2 were due to 2 scholars having graduated in April 1925 and 3 had been vacant since previous year. The Commissioner in Sind did not send any new scholar and the saving effected on account of these 5 scholarships was utilized this year again in awarding scholarships to candidates coming from the Presidency proper. The Principal was therefore able to award 8 scholarships to the students from the Presidency proper. There were thus 22 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 14 already studying in the College) and 1 from Sind. The Central Provinces Government continued stipends to 3 scholars already in College and sent 3 more scholars, Gwalior State continued stipends to 3 scholars, Baroda State gave scholarships to 2 students already studying in the College, Morvi and Dhar States continued stipends to their scholars so also did the Lingayat Education Association. In addition to the above the following States sent 1 scholar each5 15.

No. 4824 of 1926. From E. S. FAEBROTHER, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 1st July 1926. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1925-26. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Superintendent, C. V. D., Bombay Presidency. Q 24-3
19 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1925-26. Mr. E. S. Farbrother was in charge of the Department through- out the year. He was on tour for 121 days and travelled 10,229 miles by rail, 859 miles by road and 154 miles by sea. He visited 16 districts, inspected 40 Veterinary Dispensaries and selected sites for 8. He served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1925 and attended as a member the meeting of the Bombay Provincial Board of Agriculture. He also attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture in India at Pusa in December 1925. He visited the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi and inspected Government Cattle. He attended some outbreaks of Rinderpest in Surat District and supervised the inoculation of 303 animals. He also visited the Government Cattle Breeding Farm at Bankapur and the Palghar Dairy where instruction in the Serum Simultaneous method of inoculation was imparted to various members of the staff by Mr. Hugh Cooper, Pathologist of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar. He attended a General Meeting of the District Local Board, Bijapur, in which questions regarding the Veterinary Dispensaries in the District were discussed. He was a member of the Committee appointed by Government to consider the question of the transfer of control of the Medical, Vaccination and Veterinary Staffs to District Local Boards and the reorganization of the Public Health Department, and attended the meetings of the Committee held on 7th and 8th September 1925. 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superin- tendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent, throughout the year except for a period of two months viz., May and June 1925, when he was on leave. Mr. Y. N. Marathe, Veterinary Inspector, Poona Division, was appointed to act for him during this period. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy was on tour for 40 days and travelled 3,978 miles by rail and 309 miles by road. He visited five districts once or twice and inspected six Veterinary Dispensaries. He attended four outbreaks of Rinderpest and attended the demonstra- tions of Serum Simultaneous inoculations at Bankapur and Palghar. He also attended the meeting of the Provincial Board of Agricul- ture at Poona and the Provincial Co-operative Conference and visited the Agricultural Show at Alandi. He visited Bombay Pinjrapoles as usual and advised the Pinjrapole Authorities on Veterinary matters. He accompanied Dr. Soparkar of the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, to these Pinjrapoles in connection with an investigation into the incidence of Tuberculosis in Cattle.
20 I.21 This outbreak appears to have spread westward through the Nasik District (where the heaviest mortality occurred in the month of May) and Dharampur State into the Bulsar and Pardi Talukas of Surat District where a severe outbreak raged from the months of August to November. In the Kolaba District, from the beginning of the year the disease continued to spread until it reached its height in September and then gradually declined. This outbreak spread into the Northern Talukas of Ratnagiri District and thence into the Patan and Karad Talukas of Satara District. In this area the disease was spreading up to the end of the year. Rinderpest prevailed in 1,382 villages and 52,465 attacks and 23,645 deaths were reported as compared with 77,478 attacks and 36,564 deaths in the previous year, the heaviest mortality occurring in Dharwar, Kanara, Nasik, Kolaba, Ratnagiri, West Khandesh and Surat Districts. Dharwar District alone reported nearly 4,900 deaths. 8. Foot and Mouth Disease.22 The disease was confirmed microscopically in 15 outbreaks out of 64 attended. 12. Other contagious diseases reported in Bovines include Dengue, Piro-plasmosis and Cow-pox. Thirty deaths from these diseases were reported. Contagious Diseases in Other Animals. 13. The following outbreaks were reported in Sheep and Goats. Variola, Foot and Mouth Disease, Rinderpest, Anthrax and Contagious Pleuro-pneumonia. One outbreak of Epitheliosis in Fowls was also reported from Ahmedabad. One hundred and forty-two sheep and goats died in Poona District from Rinderpest. Other diseases were not widespread. The total reported mortality was 185. Forty-nine cases of Rabies were dealt with by the staff as against 67 in the previous year. The brains of 24 dogs suspected to have died from this disease were sent to the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory for examination. Preventive Measures. Table III. 14. Preventive inoculations were undertaken by the staff in 800 of the 1,382 outbreaks of Rinderpest attended. Ninety-one thousand and three hundred animals were protected from the disease in this way. Two hundred and sixteen inoculated and 13,133 uninoculated animals died in these villages. During the year 1924-25, 117,358 animals were protected in 975 outbreaks. The greatest number of inocula- tions were undertaken in Surat District where 19,430 were performed. Preliminary to the more extensive use of the Serum Simultaneous method of protection against Rinderpest, the Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, Muktesar, was requested to send an officer to demonstrate to the staff this method of inoculation. He very kindly deputed Mr. H. Cooper, M.R.C.V.S., for this purpose and the thanks of the Department are due to this officer for the valuable assistance given. The Bankapur Cattle Farm and the Palghar Dairy Farm were selected for the purpose and 183 animals were treated. More work of this nature would have been under- taken but for unforeseen circumstances. The treatment of affected cattle by iodine injection was continued during the year with more or less satisfactory results. 15. Four thousand two hundred and twenty-five animals were inoculated against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia with protective serum in 58 outbreaks as compared with 5,357 animals inoculated in the last year in 53 outbreaks. Among the inoculated animals there were four deaths only, while 509 uninoculated animals died in the course of the outbreaks. In 19 villages 1,759 animals were vaccinated with Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Vaccine against 1,275 animals in 9 villages during the last year.
23 16. In three outbreaks of Anthrax 197 cattle and 40 goats were protected by Anti-Anthrax Serum. None of the inoculated died while 33 cattle and 12 goats died uninoculated. 17. One hundred and fifty-three animals were protected with Black Quarter Serum in four outbreaks and 20 animals were protected with Black Quarter Germ Free Filtrate in one outbreak. It is regrettable that this method of protection against Black Quarter was not taken advantage of more extensively. 18. Rs. 779 were recovered as fees for inoculations and vaccina- tions against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and serum inoculations against Anthrax as against Rs. 1,189-9-0 recovered during the last year. In view of the small return in money and the unpopularity of these inoculations and vaccinations resulting from the levying of fees, it is a question for consideration whether the fees should not be abolished altogether. Other Diseases. Table IV. 19. The number of villages visited by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was 4,463 as against 4,551 in the preceding year. During the course of their tours, 16,280 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 17,041 cases for non-contagious diseases, as compared with 23,034 animals treated for contagious diseases and 13,004 for non-contagious diseases during last year. The decrease in the number of cases treated for contagious diseases results from this class of disease being less prevalent during the year under report. The total number of castra- tions performed on tour and at headquarters was 17,895 against 10,818 performed during the previous year. The new method of castration continues to grow in popularity among the ryots and is undoubtedly gradually replacing the local country operations. Investigation. 20. During the year under report 261 specimens were sent to the Sir D. M. Petit Patho-Bacteriological Laboratory, Parel, by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for examination and six specimens were sent for the College Museum. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table V. 21. There were 89 Veterinary Dispensaries at the beginning of the year and seven new Veterinary Dispen- saries were opened viz., one each at Chalisgaon, Parola and Erandol in East Khandesh District, Sindkheda in West Khandsh District, Mhaswad in Satara District and Newasa and Rahuri in Ahmednagar District, making a total of 96 at the close of the year. It is regrettable that in those districts where Veterinary Dispensaries are most urgently required, the District Local Boards are unable to open more for financial reasons. Kanara has only 3 dispensaries, Ratnagiri 2, Kolaba 3,
24 Thana 4, Poona 4 and Nasik 4. In the first four districts mentioned, disease is always very prevalent and touring difficult. It is very essential, if the work of the Department in these districts is to be extended, that more dispensaries be opened. The number of cases treated at hospitals and dispensaries numbered 124,099 against 115,144 in the past year, and medicines were supplied to 39,947 cases for home treatment against 45,636 cases last year. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was again deputed for two months to the Dangs in the Surat District. The work done by him there appears to be an advance on that done in previous years in as far as inoculations, vaccinations and castrations were performed and the question of opening a whole-time Veterinary Dispensary in the Dangs should be reconsidered as soon as possible. It is certain that there will be full scope for such a dispensary if one is opened. 22. During the year under report, grants were sanctioned for the provision of buildings for three dispensaries viz., Dakor in Kaira District, Jambusar in Broach District and Vaduj in Satara District. The latter two will be " Wadia" dispensaries, half the cost of construction being contributed from the Wadia Bequest Fund. The District Local Board, Kanara, converted the unused horse stalls at Sirsi Dispensary into Compounder's quarters, for which a Provincial grant of Rs. 235 was sanctioned. Many of the Veterinary Dispensaries are still very badly housed, and particular mention may be made of the Dispensaries at Talegaon in Sirur Taluka of Poona District, and Chiplun in Ratnagiri District. At the latter place it is extremely difficult to obtain a suitable building and the District Local Board is enquiring into the possibility of providing its own quarters. At the former, in spite of repeated requests the Board has so far taken no steps to obtain better quarters, and the dispensary is hidden away in a more or less uninhabited portion of the village. It is consequently not a success. III.25 IV.26 The work in Hospitals and Dispensaries continues to expand with the increase in the number of dispensaries. But although the number of dispensaries has increased considerably in the past few years, the distribution is very uneven, for the new institutions have been opened in a limited number of districts only. In the four coastal districts of Kanara, Ratnagiri, Kolaba and Thana there are only 12 dispensaries. Poona and Nasik District Local Boards maintain only three dispensaries each and more are urgently required in these districts. On the other hand, Bast and West Khandesh will in the near future have one dispensary in every taluka and peta. This uneven distribution of dispensaries is unfortunate for it limits the activities of the Department consi- derably and it is believed that very little improvement in this direction can be expected under present conditions. At the request of Government, proposals for the introduction of legislation for the control of contagious diseases were submitted for consideration. Until some such action is taken, very little can be done to prevent these diseases from spreading and causing considerable loss annually. The present method of dealing with them is very unsatisfactory. Administrative approval was received during the year to the entertainment of two more Veterinary Inspectors and the partial decentralisation of the work in the Superintendent's office by the creation of a separate office for the Deputy Superintendent. These changes will not however take place for the present for financial reasons. At the request of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India, the following programme of work is included in the Annual Report:27 TABLE II.

37 No. 1726-G.-IV38 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1925-26 GENERAL ADMINISTRATION Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, throughout the year under report. He inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries and District Local Board stallions and when possible attended outbreaks of contagious diseases. He attended and judged at the Jacobabad Horse and Pony Show. He was on tour in Sind for 63 days and travelled 5,039 miles by rail and 303 miles by road; as against 73 days and 3,822 miles by rail and 314 miles by road last year. In addition, he remained 6 days on tour in Rajputana and travelled 1,098 miles by rail and 40 miles by road ; as against 6 days and 1,098 miles by rail and 26 miles by road, in Rajputana, last year. He also attended the meeting of the Provincial Board of Agriculture held at Poona, when he spent 10 days and travelled 2,216 miles by rail and 8 miles by road. I.39 6. Rabies.40 17. Babies. - Forty-four dogs were attacked and all died or were destroyed in the districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Upper Sind Frontier and Larkana. 18. Four dogs bitten by other rabid dogs were successfully treated at Shikar pur and Hyderabad with Anti-Rabic Vaccine obtained from the Haffkine Institute, Bombay. 19. Rinderpest.41 (vii) Veterinary Dispensaries Table V. 26. There were 16 Veterinary Dispensaries working during the year, the same number as last year. The total number of patients treated at dispen- saries was 26,250 against 24,572 in the previous year. Medicines and advice were given to the owners of 7,994 animals which were not brought to the dispensaries for treatment, making a total of 34,244 animals treated and supplied with medicines as compared with a total of 29,574 animals in the previous year. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries was 129 as against 125 in the previous year. The increase in the number of patients treated is satisfactory. 27. The Burdizzo Castrator has recently been supplied to five Veterinary Dispensaries and it is hoped that the new method of castration will be appreciated by the people and animals will be brought readily for the operation. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons are requested to demonstrate to the people the use of this instrument and make the method popular. III.42 (iv) Fairs and Shows Table XIII. 31.

56 No. P.57 Financial. 9. The total expenditure of the department amounted to Rs. 1,27,740 as against Rs. 1,30,182 in the previous year. General remarks.58 A lazaretto in Karachi is undoubtedly a necessity for the Province. Its absence is one of the reasons why the port of Karachi is closed for the importation of equine animals. This leads to the somewhat unreasonable result that the supply of good horses from the Gulf and Mesopotamia is shut off from Karachi. The result is that for ghari work inferior horses are brought down from the Punjab, and disease is much more likely to occur among them than amog imported animals which are carefully examined. Such importation and examination is possible even before the lazaretto is constructed, and it is hoped that the port may be opened as proposed, Mr. Jerrom performed the duties of his office in an energetic and tactful manner; and the Commissioner thinks that the Department has done good work daring the year.

BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE Parel, 10th June 1927. From K. HEWLETT, ESQ., O.B.E., Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith the Forty-first Annual Administration Report of the Bombay Veterinary College. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, K. HEWLETT, Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College. Q 16ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 Mr. K. Hewlett, held charge as Principal of the College up to 16th of June when he proceeded on leave, Mr. V. R. Phadke the Acting Professor of Veterinary Science taking over from that date. Mr. Phadke continued to act up to 23rd of December when Mr. Hewlett returned from leave. Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala acted as Professor of Veterinary Science during the period Mr. Phadke acted as Principal and proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement from 24th of December. Mr. Mohey Deen, M.R.C.V.S., was appointed to act as Assistant Professor in the arrangement conse- quent upon Mr. Hewlett proceeding on leave and subsequently to till the vacancy caused by Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala's retirement. Khan Sahib Shaikh Ahmed, Mr. Miranda and Mr. Nair continued to hold charge of their appointments throughout the year under report. 2. The Students.4 6. Of the 97 students on the rolls at the commencement of the first session (June) three students discontinued the course on account of ill health, 1 on account of family circumstances and 2 left the College having passed the supplementary final examination. There were consequently 91 students' names on the rolls at the end of the year as against 82 at the commencement. 7. There were 8 scholarships vacant at the commencement of the year, viz., 3 for youths from the Presidency proper and 5 for youths from Sind. The Commissioner in Sind sent only 3 new scholars and the saving effected on account of the 2 remaining Sindhi scholarships was utilised for awarding scholarships to candidates coming from the Presidency proper. The Principal was therefore able to award 7 scholarships to the candidates from the Presidency proper. There were in all 18 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 11 already studying at the College) and 4 from Sind. The Central Provinces Government continued stipends to 2 scholars already in the College and sent 5 more scholars. Dhar, Rajpipla and Miraj States continued stipends to their scholars. In addition Baroda State sent 3 scholars, Gwalior State 2 and Jamkhandi State 1. The Deccan Maratha Educational Association allotted a stipend to one student. There were thus 37 students in receipt of some assistance from scholarships and 54 without such assistance at the end of the year. 8. The Students' Hostel.5 14. Clinical Instruction.6 18.

13 No. 47/L of 1927. BOMBAY VETERINARY COLLEGE, Parel, 10th June 1927. From K. HEWLETT, ESQ., O.B.E., Indian Veterinary Service, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit the Annual Administration Report of the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department for the year 1926-27 dealing with equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work performed under the Live Stock Importation Act. 2. I held charge of the Department up to 16th of June when I proceeded on leave and Mr. V. R. Phadke assumed charge. Mr. Phadke continued to act until my return from leave on 23rd of December. Khan Sahib Dhakmarvala held charge of the office of Assistant Government Veterinary Officer during the period Mr. Phadke was acting for me. Mr. Rebello, the Deputy Superintend- ent, was on leave for six weeks from 18th October to 28th of November and Mr. H. M. Browne, M. B. E., the Chief Veterinary Inspector, was appointed to act in his place during this period 3. During the year under report 5 horses were destroyed under the Glanders and Farcy Act, viz., 2 for Glanders and 3 for Surra, and 3 for Glanders (non-clinical) under the Live Stock Importation Act as under:14 4. During the year under report 2,755 horses, and 510 mules and 8 zebras were imported into Bombay as against 2,587 horses and 3 zebras last year and 2,860 horses, 1 donkey, 342 mules and 1 zebra in the preceding year. 5.

No. 6018-A of 1927 From E. S. FARBROTHER, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 30th June 1927. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1926-27. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. Q 16-3
19 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 I continued to hold charge of the Civil Veterinary Department during the year under report. I was on tour for 102 days and travelled 2,651 miles by road and 3,091 miles by rail. I toured in Ahmednagar, Poona, Sholapur, Satara, Belgaum, Dharwar and Kanara districts by road and inspected all the dispensaries in these districts with the exception of Barsi, Athni and Kumta. I also toured in East Khaudesh, West Khandesh, Bijapur and, Bombay Suburban districts by rail and inspected most of the Veterinary Dispensaries maintained by the Local Bodies in these areas. Whilst touring in Dharwar and Belgaum, I visited the Cattle breeding farms at Bankapur and Tegur and the Vaccine Institute at Belgaum. I served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1926 and conducted the supplementary examination held at the College in the following October. At the request of the Committee of the Peresidency Agricultural Show, I acted as Secretary of the Veterinary Section of the Show and made all arrangements in connection with that section. 2. The post of Deputy Superintendent and personal Assistant to the Superintendent was held by Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy from 1st to 6th April, when he proceeded to Karachi to take over the duties of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, during the absence on leave of Mr. Jerrom. He resumed his duties in the Presidency Proper on 23rd November and continued to work in his usual capacity up to the end of the year. He was on tour for thirteen days in the Presidency and travelled 924 miles by rail and 18 miles by road. He protected cattle against Rinderpest by the Serum Simultaneous method at the Infants and Public Milk Supply Company, Limited, Dairy Farm, Palghar and as usual visited the Bombay Pinjrapole from time to time. 3. During Khan Saheb Buxy's absence in Sind, his post was held by Mr. Y. N. Marathe, Veterinary Inspector, Poona Division. Mr. Marathe was on tour for nineteen days and travelled 1,676 miles by rail and 365 miles by road. He visited five districts, inspected 23 Veterinary Dispensaries and selected a temporary building for a new Veterinary Dispensary during the course of his tours. He visited Kaira in connection with an outbreak of Surra among the Police horses stationed there and also inspected the District Local Board Stallions at Ahmednagar. I.20 Other arrangements for giving further training to the Sub- ordinate Staff have therefore had to be made and Government have agreed to send men to the Madras Veterinary College to undertake the Post Graduate course of instruction held annually at that Institution. If a similar course could be introduced at the Bombay Veterinary College it would be of great advantage to the Department. II.21 concerned had considerably improved except in the Kolaba, Ratnagiri and Satara districts, where it was continuing to spread. During the year 1926-27, although reports of this disease were received from all districts except Panch Mahals and East Khandesh, those mentioned above and also Dharwar and Kanara were the most widely affected. The highest recorded mortality was in May when 1,126 deaths were reported. It may be mentioned, that three of the districts mentioned above, viz., Kanara, Ratnagiri and Kolaba, have only three, two and three Veterinary Dispensaries each. In all other districts Rinderpest was not wide spread, occasional outbreaks only being reported. The total number of villages affected was 360, in which 15,189 cattle were attacked and 7,002 died. In 1925-26, 1,382 villages were affected, 52,465 animals attacked and 23,645 died. 9. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.22 13. Other Contagious Diseases.23 which were not inoculated in these particular outbreaks died of Anthrax. 18. Protective inoculation against Black Quarter, both by means of Serum and Germ Free Filtrate was also carried out, 903 by the former method and 63 by the latter. This is a considerable increase over the number of last year when 153 were inoculated with Serum and 20 with Germ Free Filtrate. The results were very satis- factory, only one death being reported among those inoculated with Serum, and I hope that these results will lead to the more widespread use of these preventive measures. 19. Charges on account of Sera and vaccines used in protecting animals against Hemorrhagic Septicaemia, Anthrax and Black Quarter are made to the owners at the rate of two annas per animal. A sum of Rs. 1,240-12-0 was recovered in this way and credited to Government, against Rs. 779 last year. The cost of the Sera and vaccines used amounted to Rs. 4,213-2-0. There is no doubt that these charges interfere very greatly with the more extensive use of these products. In my last report I suggested that they should be discontinued and if this suggestion is acted upon, I am sure that the ryots will take greater advantage of the relief afforded to them. In particular anti-anthrax serum should be given free of charge. Other Diseases Table IV. 20. During the year under report, the staff visited 4,706 villages and treated 25,804 animals for contagious diseases and 24,715 for non-contagious diseases. This again is a considerable increase over the work accomplished last year, when 4,463 villages were visited and 33,321 animals treated for disease, both contagious and non-contagious and is an indication that the services of the Department are being more readily taken advantage of by the people. Whilst visiting these villages, the members of the Staff castrated 9,985 animals as against 9,185 last year. Investigation 21. Three hundred and seven specimens were sent to the Bombay Veterinary College for examination. One hundred and ninety-five post mortem examinations were conducted for investiga- tion and Medico-legal cases. In connection with the latter 78 specimens were sent to the Government Analyst for examination and in 18 cases the cause of death was declared to be poison. Veterinary Dispensaries Table V. 22. Seven new dispensaries wer opened during the year bringing the total number in the Presidency proper to 103. The new dispensaries were opened at Bhadgaon and Yawal in East Khandesh, Taloda in West Khandesh, Junnar in Poona, Rahimatpur in Satara and Karjat and Akola in Ahmednagar districts. East Khandesh District Local Board were anxious to open one more dispensary at Edlabad, but this had to be postponed as a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and Government grant-in-aid were not available. No new dispensaries
24 were opened in the coastal districts, where, as pointed out last year, more are very urgently needed. The number of cases treated at Hospitals and Dispensaries amounted to 1,35,299 and medicines were supplied to 45,867 cases for treatment at home. The numbers for the previous year were 1,24,099 and 39,947 respectively. Among the cases treated at Hospitals and Dispensaries were 10,928 which were castrated. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was again deputed to the Dangs for two months. He was on tour for 53 days and visited 27 villages. During his stay there, no epidemics were prevailing and so his energies were confined to the treatment of ordinary diseases and propaganda. He was supplied with a Burdizzo Castrator and was able to operate on a few animals by this method. The period spent by this officer in the Dangs is far too short and the question of extending the period of his stay there is under consideration. 23. Buildings.25 The number of Veterinary Inspectors is far too small for the work they have to undertake, and a large addition to their number is urgently required. There has been no increase in their number since 1920 when the number of dispensaries was 65. The Veterinary Inspectors inspected all the dispensaries in their respective divisions three or more times and visited 210 villages to check the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and to attend Fairs and Markets. In the course of their tours they travelled 11,1594 miles by road and 23,611 by rail. With few exceptions the whole of the staff has worked well and conscientiously during the year. The clerical staff also worked exceedingly well. Two temporary clerks were added to their number during the year, making nine in all. This addition has eased the situation somewhat but since all the work of the Department is centralised, the number of clerical appointments is still small. V.26 At the request of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India, the following programme of work for the year 1927-28 is included in the report:27 TABLE II Showing the number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1926-27 District Equines Bovines.

37 No. 1704/G.-IV-3. From J. H. G. JERROM, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. (Through the Commissioner in Sind.) Karachi, dated the 15th June 1927. Subject.38 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1926-27 GENERAL ADMINISTRATION Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V. S., held charge of the Office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, during the year under report, with the exception of the period 13th April to 18th November 1926 when he was on leave and Khan Sahib J. D. Buxy, Deputy Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, acted for him. Mr. Jerrom inspected all the veterinary dispensaries and District Local Board stallions and, when possible, attended outbreaks of contagious disease. He attended and judged at the Jacobabad Horse and Pony Show. He was on tour in Sind for 54 days and travelled 3,623 miles by rail and 237 miles by road as against 63 days and 5,039 miles by rail and 303 miles by road. In addition, he remained 6 days on tour in Rajputana and travelled 1,098 miles by rail and 76 miles by road as against 6 days and 1,098 miles by rail and 40 miles by road. 2. Khan Sahib J. D. Buxy, while acting Superintendent, inspected veterinary dispensaries at Sukkur, Shikarpur, Hyderabad and Jacobabad and also attended outbreaks of Glanders at Jacobabad, Sukkur and Rohri. He also inspected the District Local Board stallions at Jacobabad. He was on tour for 15 days and travelled 2,104 miles by rail and 52 miles by road. I.39 7. Rabies.40 19. Anthrax.41 (vii) Veterinary Dispensaries Table V. 26. There were 16 Veterinary Dispensaries working at the beginning of the year. Two more were opened in July 1926. There were thus 18 dispensaries working at the end of the year. The total number of patients treated at the dispensaries was 26,438 against 26,250 in the previous year. Medicines and advice were given to the owners of 3,761 animals which were not brought to the dispensaries for treat- ment as against 7,994 in the previous year. The decrease is due to the fact that orders have been issued to Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to discourage the practice of supplying medicines without seeing the animals. 27. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries was 268 as compared with 129 in the previous year. III.42 32. The number of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is inadequate for the large tract of country they have to cover in attending out-breaks of contagious disease and great difficulty is sometimes experienced when one or two extensive out-breaks of Rinderpest break out simultaneously. Proposals were submitted to Govern- ment for the opening of three new dispensaries and, although approved, it was not found possible to allot funds for the purpose. It is, therefore, strongly recommended that the requisite provision be made in the Budget Estimates for 1928-29. 33. The Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, was on tour for 163 days and travelled 2,365 miles by rail and 709 miles by road. The Veterinary Inspector, Lower Sind Circle, was 166 days on tour and travelled 4,569 miles by rail and 779 miles by road. Both the Veterinary Inspectors, in addition to inspection of veterinary dispensaries every quarter, did good work in the district both in attending out-breaks of disease and in checking the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. 34. On the whole the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons worked well during the year under report and the following deserve special mention :43 39. As pointed out last year, the reserve of three Veterinary Assistant Surgeons is too small and should be raised to five. Recently, three men were on sick leave and at the same time there occurred several out-breaks of Rinderpest. The resources of the Department were taxed to the utmost in dealing with the disease and in two instances, dispensaries had to be left in charge of Salutris. 40. At the request of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India, the following programme of work for the next year is included in the Annual Report:44 TABLE II Showing number of deaths from contagious diseases amongst animals during the year 1926-27 District Equines Bovines Other animals Remarks Glanders Surra Rabies Other contagious diseases Total Rinderpest Foot and Mouth disease Hæmorrhagic Sep- ticæmia Black quarter Anthrax Other contagious diseases Total Foot and Mouth disease Contagious Pleuro- pneumonia Surra Rabies Anthrax Black quarter Other contagious diseases Total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Karachi ... 1 2 ... 1 4 8 25 365 2 ... 21 422 ... 109 ... 22 ... 23 88 242 Hyderabad ... 1 3 ... ... 4 14 11 3 ... 1 7 36 ... 112 2 1 ... ... 4 119 Thar Parkar ... ... 1 ... ... 1 105 ... ... ... 38 ... 143 ... 20 5 ... ... ... 56 81 Nawabshah ... ... ... ... 3 3 771 17 167 ... ... ... 955 11 390 ... ... 60 ... 381 842 Sukkur ... 5 2 ... 5 12 691 1 26 ... ... 1 719 ... ... ... 3 ... ... 17 20 Larkana ... ... ... ... ... ... 131 18 247 ... ... 1 397 ... 75 ... 2 7 ... 61 145 Upper Sind Frontier. 2 ... 1 ... 3 ... 8 33 ... ... ... 41 ... ... 1 2 ... ... 5 8 Total ... 9 8 1 9 27 1,720 81 841 2 39 30 2,713 11 706 30 67 23 612 1,457

54 No. P.-358-G GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 16th July 1927. Subject.55 Thar Parkar, disposed of an Arab pony stallion which was not popular among the zamindars. The stallions covered 445 mares during the year as against 472 mares in the previous year. The aggregate cost of their maintenance was Rs. 5,832 of which Government contri- buted Rs. 2,912-7-0. Financial. 9. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,84,546 as against Rs. 1,27,740 in the previous year. General Remarks. The interest taken in the work of the Department by Local Bodies is reflected in the increase in expenditure incurred by them over last year of Rs. 41,667 and it is regrettable that Government have not found it possible to keep pace with their requirements. It is parti- cularly unfortunate that the touring of the Assistant Surgeons had to be curtailed and that stallions could not be purchased owing to lack of funds. New dispensaries are also urgently required and it is hoped that suitable provision will be made in the next year's budget for these items. The sanction of Government to the import of live stock at the port of Karachi should increase the supply of good horses in the Province. Draft rules have been recently submitted for the approval of Government. The construction of a lazeretto at Karachi is urgently required and although the plans and estimates have been sanctioned and the land acquired, funds have not yet been made available. The Commissioner considers that this work should be given a very high place in the list of Major Works for 1928. Mr. Jerrom administered the department efficiently and tactfully and Khan Sahib Buxy, while acting for him, carried out the duties satisfactorily. (Signed) W. F. HUDSON, Commissioner in Sind.

There were 8 scholarships vacant at the commencement of the year, viz., 4 for youths from the Presidency proper and 4 for youths from Sind. The 4 vacancies from the Presidency proper were due to 4 scholars having graduated in April. Of the 4 vacancies from Sind one was due to a scholarship having been withdrawn as the student failed to pass his examination and 3 had been vacant since the previous year. The Principal awarded 4 scholarships to students from the Presidency proper and the Commissioner in Sind sent three new scholars and continued scholarship to a student already studying at the College. There were in all 14 scholars from the Presidency proper (including 10 already studying at the College) and 6 from Sind.

No. 6444 of 1928 From E. S. FARBROTHER, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department Bombay Presidency, Poona To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Poona, 30th June 1928. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Government the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1927-28. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, E. S. FARBROTHER, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona. Q 1719 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1927-28 I continued to hold charge of the Department throughout the year 1927-28. I was on tour for 107 days and visited all the districts of the Presidency with the exception of Belgaum, Bijapur and Kanara. I travelled 5,099 miles by rail and 2,290 miles by road and during the course of my tours, inspected 45 Veterinary dispensaries and the stallions maintained by the District Local Board, Ahmednagar, and inspected sites and buildings selected for Veterinary dispensaries. I served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1927 and conducted the supplementary examination held at the College in the following October. I also attended the meeting of the Provincial Board of Agriculture and superintended operations for the protection of cattle against Rinderpest in Dharwar District. 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superin- tendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year with the exception of 5 days when he was on leave. He was on tour for 39 days and travelled 4,865 miles by rail and 262 miles by road and visited 5 districts. He protected by the serum- simultaneous method of inoculation 51 cattle at the Bankapur Cattle Breeding Farm and collected material for investigation into the cause of abortion on two private farms. He visited the Bombay Pinjrapole and its branches as usual and gave advice to the Trustees in connection with the live-stock maintained at that institution. I.20 Equine Contagious Diseases 5. Glanders.21 Contagious Diseases in other Animals 13. A contagious disease among sheep and goats, particularly the latter, was reported from several talukas of Bijapur District towards the end of the year. Four hundred animals were reported to have been attacked by this disease, of which 265 died. Investi- gation into the cause of this disease is not complete, but in some respects it resembled Rinderpest and was dealt with as such, and Anti rinderpest inoculations appeared to have some beneficial results. Unfortunately some three quarter bred merino rams introduced into the district by the Wilson Anti Famine Institute succumbed. Scabies in Goats was also reported from this district. " Kymac " Sheep dip was tried on some affected animals and the results reported were very satisfactory. Other diseases reported under this head were variola, Foot and Mouth Disease, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and pleuropneumonia in sheep and goats, fowl cholera and rabies. Sixty-five cases of suspected rabies were dealt with by the staff, of which 25 were proved positive by examination of brains at the Bombay Bacterio- logical Laboratory. Preventive Measures Table II. 14. Rinderpest.22 18. A sum of Rs. 1,502-13-0 was recovered as fees from the owners of cattle protected against Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, Anthrax and Black Quarter. Cattle in Gujerat were inoculated against Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia free of charge after the floods, as a relief measure. Now that Government have sanctioned the free supply of these sera and vaccines, a large increase in the number of serum inoculations and vaccinations against the above mentioned diseases is anticipated. Other Diseases Table III. 19. The work under this head for the past two years is indicated in the following tabular statement:23 The work done in these dispensaries is as follows :24 One was certainly old and not a very good foal-getter, but no complaints were received regarding the other. There is still a demand for the services of stallions in this district, but unfortunately the present financial position of the Board, precludes the possibility of any new ones being purchased in the near future.

JERROM, ESQ., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana; To The SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Through the Commissioner in Sind. Karachi, dated 21st June 1928. Subject.39 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1927-1928 GENERAL ADMINISTRATION Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, during the year under report. He inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries and District Local Board stallions with the exception of the stallion at Garhi Yasin; and when possible, attended outbreaks of contagious disease. He attended and judged at the Jacobabad Horse and Pony show. He was on tour in Sind for 70 days and travelled 3,178 miles by rail and 626 miles by road as against 54 days and 3,623 miles by rail and 237 miles by road in the previous year. In addition, he remained 6 days on tour in Rajputana and travelled 1,065 miles by rail and 86 miles by road as against 6 days and 1,098 miles by rail and 76 miles by road. I.40 (ii) Bovine Contagious Disease 8. Rinderpest.41 uninoculated and 28 inoculated animals died. The treatment of affected cattle with intravenous injection of iodine was carried out with satisfactory results. 19. Two thousand, five hundred and thirty-seven animals were inoculated with Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia Protective Serum in 18 outbreaks as compared with 3,564 inoculations performed in the previous year. One hundred and seventy-seven uninoculated and 8 inoculated animals died. (v) Other diseases Table III. 20. The number of villages visited by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was 1,841 against 1,686 in the previous year. During their tours, they treated 5,747 cases for contagious and 1,878 for non-contagious diseases and performed 1,850 castrations against 8,627 cases for contagious and 1,363 cases for non-contagious diseases, and 668 castrations performed in the previous year. Most of the castrations were performed with the Burdizzo Castrator. Out of the 1,850 castrations, 1,468 were performed in the Thar Parkar district alone, where the Burdizzo method has become very popular. This is chiefly due to the very keen interest taken in the work by Mr. Henderson, Collector of the district. (vi) Investigation 21. During the year under report, 121 specimens from suspici- ous cases of glanders, surra, piroplasmosis, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, mange, dourine, filariasis, fowl cholera, coccidiosis, black quarter, etc., were submitted by the Subordinate staff to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, for examination. Of these, 54 were confirmed. In addition, 20 brains from cases of rabies were submitted to the Haffkine Institute, Bombay. (vii) Veterinary Dispensaries Table IV. 22. There were 18 Veterinary Dispensaries working, the same number as last year. The total number of patients treated at the dispensaries was 27,323 against 26,438 in the previous year. Medicines and advice were given to the owners of 3,827 animals which were not brought to the dispensaries for treatment as against 3,761 in the previous year. The number of castrations performed at dispensaries was 442 as compared with 268 in the previous year. III.42 The cost of maintenance of the stallions was Rs. 6,188 of which Government contributed Rs. 2,837-8-0. It is regrettable that, owing to Government grant not being available, no stallions could be purchased during the year, although some of the District Local Boards were keen on buying additional stallions.

53 No. P.-358-G. GENERAL DEPARTMENT. Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 18th July 1928. Subject.54 Veterinary Instruction. 7. There were three stipendiary students studying at the Bombay Veterinary College at the begin- ning of the year. Four more scholars were sent to the College during the year under report. Of the three scholars at the College at the beginning of the year one failed in the examination and his scholarship was stopped. Of the four scholars sent up during the year one left owing to ill-health and the scholarship vacated by him was awarded to a Sindhi student already studying in the final year class. There were thus 6 scholars at the end of the year. Breeding operations. 8. Out of the 9 District Local Board stallions at the beginning of the year, one was sold owing to old age and ill-health, thus leaving 8 at the close of the year. 476 mares were covered during the year as against 445 in the previous year. The aggregate cost of the maintenance of stallions was Rs. 6,188 of which Government contributed Rs. 2,837-8-0. Financial. 9. The total expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 1,60,190 as against Rs. 1,81,515 in the previous year. General Remarks. 10. It is regrettable that owing to financial stringency it was not found possible to provide funds for the opening of new dispensaries and purchase of additional stallions. These are objects on which the District Local Boards have for the last two years been showing considerable keenness. The construction of a lazaretto at Karachi is another item of urgency and although plans and estimates have been sanctioned and the land acquired, funds have not yet been made available. It is hoped that Government will be pleased to provide funds as early as possible. 11. The Port of Karachi was opened for the import of live-stock from 1st March 1928. 12. The Commissioner commends the efficient and tactful administration of the department by Mr. Jerrom. G. A. THOMAS, Commissioner in Sind. To The SECRETARY to GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay.

No. 7907 of 1929. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTDMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, POONA: Poona, 29th June 1929. From KHAN SAHEB J. D. BUXY, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to submit for the consideration of Govern- ment the Annual Administration Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the year 1928-29. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. D. BUXY, Offg. Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency. Q 30ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29. Mr. E. S. Farbrother, I.V.S., held charge of the office of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, for the whole of the year under report excepting a period of six days at the end of the year from 26th March 1929 when he proceeded on leave out of India and I took over charge from him. He was on tour for eighty-one days and travelled 7,825 miles by rail and 1,091 miles by road. He visited eleven Districts and inspected twenty-seven Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. During the course of his tours he inspected the offices of Veterinary Inspectors also. He interviewed the Collector of Bijapur in connec- tion with the Wilson Anti-Famine Institute, Bijapur. He supervised the work of castration and inoculations in several villages. He served as President of the Board of Examiners at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1928 and also conducted the supple- mentary examination, at that College, in the following October. He attended the meetings of the Horse Show Committee of the Presidency Agricultural Show, held at Ahmedabad, as a member, and acted as President of the Judging Committee of the Horse Show. He also acted as a Judge in the Cattle and Horse Show Section of the District Agricultural Show held in the month of January 1929 at Ahmednagar. In October 1928 he attended the Conference convened by the Government of India at Simla, to consider the Report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India. As Officiating Superintendent, I was on tour for four days and travelled 619 miles by rail and 29 miles by road. I inspected two Veterinary Dispensaries and selected site for location of an opera- tion shed in one of them and also inspected the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Dharwar Division. 2. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of the Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year with the exception of six days when he was Officiating Superintendent and Mr. Y. N. Marathe was appointed in his place. The Deputy Superintendent was on tour for forty-one days and travelled 6,845 miles by rail and 70 miles by road. He visited five Districts and attended meetings of the Horse Show Sub-Committee of the Presidency Agricultural Show held at Ahmedabad. He also acted as Secretary of the Horse Show Committee and Veterinary Section in the Presidency Agricultural Show at Ahmedabad. He visited the Bombay Panjrapole and its branches and attended the meeting of the Panjrapole Committee to
19 give advice to the Trustees, and investigated the prevalence of surra at the Chembur Panjrapole. He also visited Kalyan to enquire into the extent of Rinderpest outbreaks in the Murbad Taluka. I.20 7. Rinderpest was reported from all the Districts and the City of Bombay excepting Panch Mahals, Broach, Surat, Bijapur, Kanara and Ratnagiri Districts. It was somewhat severe in the Thana and Kolaba Districts, In other Districts the disease did not appear to any great extent. Six thousand six hundred and twenty- nine attacks and four thousand eight hundred and thirty-one deaths were recorded against 3,463 attacks and 1,717 deaths in the previous year. 8. Foot and Mouth Disease.21 The only Districts affected with it were Belgaum, Kanara and Nasik, of which Belgaum suffered heavily. Goatscab was again responsible for a large number of deaths among sheep and goats. There were 449 attacks and 155 deaths all from the Bijapur District. Other diseases reported under this head were Fowl Cholera, Chicken-Pox, Anthrax in goats, Spirochetosis in birds and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia in sheep and goats. Forty-eight cases of suspected Rabies in dogs were dealt with by the staff of which 25 were proved positive by examination of brains out of a total of 46 sent to the Haffkine Institute, Bombay. Preventive Measures. Table II. 14. Rinderpest.22 17. Anthrax.23 the number treated in the previous year tends to indicate the growing popularity of these institutions. The necessity for such more institutions is keenly felt by the Agriculturists and Live-Stock owners. Seventeen thousand six hundred and fifty castrations were performed in the dispensaries as against 16,691 last year, thus bringing up the total number of castrations at the Dispensaries and on tour to 31,996 as against 25,890 last year. Fifteen hundred and fifty-eight cases were admitted into Veterinary Hospitals for Cruelty to Animals and 901 owners were convicted for the offence. Largest number of cases were admitted to the Veterinary Hospital, Poona City, and next to it in the Veterinary Hospital at Ahmedabad. During the year under report a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was sent to the Dangs for a period of seven months. He visited 264 villages and travelled 1,122 miles by road. Ninety outbreaks of contagious cattle diseases were attended by him. Of these, 68 were for Foot and Mouth disease, three for Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, eighteen were for Black Quarter and one for Dengue. He inoculated 27 animals against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and 153 against Black Quarter. Four hundred and fifteen animals were also protected by Black Quarter Aggressin. One thousand seven hundred and forty-six animals were treated for Foot and Mouth disease and medicine was supplied to 435 cases. The necessity of maintaining this Dispensary for the whole year is keenly felt and the Political Authorities in charge of the Dangs are considering the question. 22. Buildings.24 (2) Fairs and Shows. A Horse Show was held at the Presidency Agricultural Show held at Ahmedabad in November 1928 and prizes were distributed from the Agricultural Show Fund. The number of entries were, however, very poor. A small District Agricultural Show was also held in January 1929 at Ahmednagar. IV.25 made to maintain efficiency, but with the work increasing all round, the supervising and subordinate staff is found to be most inadequate to do full justice. During the year there were applications for opening 16 new dispensaries but none can be opened for want of Government grants-in-aid. The District Local Board, Poona, has opened two new dispen- saries and they are maintained solely from their own funds, as no Government grant-in-aid is available. They deserve credit for it. Owing to retrenchment, the normal expansion of the Department has received a set back. The Civil Veterinary Department had in their Veterinary Section opened a fully equipped veterinary dispensary at the Presidency Agricultural Show, Ahmedabad, where sick animals were treated. Different exhibits pertaining to the Department were exhibited and castrations by Burdizzo Castrator demonstrated and lectures were given in Vernacular on the various animal diseases. The information bureau supplied all necessary information to the public. Programme of work for the year 1929-30 The energies of the Department will be directed towards the investigation of certain diseases and application of modern method of treatment. J. D. BUXY, Offg.

Subject.41 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1928-29 GENERAL ADMINISTRATION Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, during the year under report. He inspected all the Veterinary Dispensaries except Jamesabad. He also inspected the District Local Board stallions with the exception of the one at Garhi Yasin and, when possible, attended outbreaks of contagious disease. He attended and judged at the Jacobabad Horse and Pony Show. He was on tour in Sind for 71 days and travelled 2,359 miles by rail and 499 miles by road as against 70 days and 3,178 miles by rail and 626 miles by road. In addition, he remained six days on tour in Rajputana and travelled 1,065 miles by rail and 33 miles by road as against six days and 1,065 miles by rail and 86 miles by road. I42 7. Foot-and-Mouth disease.43 (iv) Preventive Inoculations 19.Table II.44 Rs. 4,896 of which Government contributed Rs. 2,167. The neces- sity of more stallions is keenly felt and the District Local Boards are desirous of buying additional stallions but find it difficult to purchase any without a Government grant. It is regrettable that no grant was available this year and it is urged that Government should help the District Local Boards by sanctioning a grant for at least four more stallions. Unless this is done, horse breeding in Sind will die a natural death.

Reports. 56 whilst of the unprotected 2,401 succumbed to the disease. This is the first time that inoculations against this disease have been undertaken on such an extensive scale: the results are very satisfactory. Government are glad to note that the number of bovines protected against rinderpest by means of the serum-simulta- neous method of inoculation has increased from 98 in the previous year to 182 in the year under report. In view of the recommenda- tion of the Royal Agricultural Commission on the subject, they trust that this method of inoculation will be more extensively adopted. 3. Government recognise the imperative need for an increase in the number of veterinary dispensaries, but regret that owing to the existing financial-stringency no progress in this direction is at present possible. They are pleased to record their appreciation of the work of the department during the year under report. By order of the Government of Bombay (Transferred Departments), G. K.

There were nine scholarships vacant at the commencement of the year, viz., 7 for youths from the Presidency proper and 2 for youths from Sind. Of the 7 vacancies from the Presidency proper 6 were due to 6 scholars having graduated in April and one was due to a scholarship having been withdrawn as the student failed to pass his examination. Of the two vacancies from Sind one was due to a scholar having graduated in April and one had been vacant since the previous year. The Principal awarded 7 scholarships to students from the Presidency proper and the Commissioner in Sind sent one new scholar. There were in all 14 scholars from the Presidency proper and 5 from Sind. The Central Provinces Government continued stipends to 11 scholars already studying at the College and sent 22 more scholars.

FARBROTHER, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.19 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1929-30 Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held charge of the office of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, from the 1st April till 27th of January 1930 while I was on leave. I took over charge from him on 28th January 1930 and continued to hold it till the end of the year. Khan Saheb Buxy was on tour for seventy-two days and travelled 934 miles by road and 6,749 miles by rail. He visited 14 districts and during the course of his tours, inspected 25 dispensaries and selected sites or buildings for five dispensaries. He conducted special tours in Dharwar and Kanara Districts in connection with epidemics, visiting 20 villages and the cattle breeding farms at Bankapur and Tegur. He superintended work at the Dairy farm of the Infants and Public Milk Supply Company, Limited, Palghar where serum simultaneous inoculation of the dairy stock was under- taken against Rinderpest. He served as a member of the Board of Examiners at the Annual Examinations held at the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1929 and also conducted the supple- mentary examinations in the month of October. He twice visited the Bombay Panjrapole and acted as a judge at the Cattle show held by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Ahmedabad. He gave evidence before the Sub-Committee of the "Hides Cess Enquiry Committee." He proceeded on leave on 28th January. I was on tour for nine days and travelled 90 miles by road and 1,118 miles by rail. I visited two Districts, inspected two Veteri- nary Dispensaries and one Veterinary Inspector's office. I also attended four out-breaks of cattle disease including one at the Tegur Farm in the Dharwar District. 2. Mr. Y. N. Marathe held the post of Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant to the Superintendent throughout the year under report. He was on tour for fifty days and travelled 1,084 miles by road, 1,894 miles by rail and 288 miles by sea. He visited 7 districts, inspected 26 Veterinary Dispensaries and selected sites for seven dispensaries. He visited 10 villages and the Mhasa cattle fair in Thana District in connection with epidemics and attended the final meeting of the Agricultural Show at Ahmednagar. I.20 II.21 One thousand seven hundred and twenty-four out-breaks were attended as compared with 2,152 in the year 1928-29. 9. Hæmorrhagic Septcæmia was reported from all districts of the Presidency and 5,071 attacks and 4,364 deaths were recorded. There was a slight increase in the number of attacks recorded over last year though the mortality was less. 10. Three thousand two hundred and seventy-eight animals were affected with Black Quarter disease and 3,024 succumbed in 434 villages. There is some reduction in the number of attacks and deaths in comparison with the previous year when 5,698 attacks and 5,330 deaths were reported. 11. Anthrax was reported from 14 districts, Ahmedabad, Kaira, Panch Mahals, Surat and Satara districts being free and no case was reported from the City of Bombay. This disease was respon- sible for 418 deaths among the 513 cattle affected. The largest number of attacks and deaths was recorded in the Dharwar District Sixty-four villages were affected with this disease against 64 in the preceding year, when 498 attacks and 394 deaths were reported. 12. Other Diseases.22 15. Hæmorrhagic Septicemia.23 preceding year. Two hundred and thirty-four post mortem examinations were conducted for diagnostic purposes and one hundred and one for medico-legal purposes. Viscera were submitted in thirty cases of the latter for chemical examination and in 7 cases only were poisons detected by the Chemical Analyser to Government. Veterinary Dispensaries. 20. There were 105 Veterinary Dispensaries at the beginning Table IV. of the year, excluding that maintained in the Dangs, and no new ones were opened. Applications for opening 16 new dispensaries were received but as grants-in-aid were not available the proposals had to be abandoned. The District Local Board, Poona, continued to maintain two Veterinary Dispensaries, viz., at Indapur and Talegaon- Dabhade without the help of Government. The number of in and out-patients treated at Hospitals and Dispensaries during the year under report was 4,795 and 154,540 respectively. Forty-eight thousand three hundred and forty-eight cases were supplied with medicines for treatment at home. There is a slight decrease in the number of cases treated over the previous year, which may be partly due to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons being absent from their head-quarters for long periods on epidemic duty. The number of castrations performed in Hospitals and Dispen- saries increased from 17,650 to 19,131. Eight hundred and fifty-three cases were sent to infirmaries under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and 692 owners were convicted for offences under the Act. Four hundred and sixty-nine and 205 of these cases were admitted at the Ahmedabad and Poona City Hospitals, respectively. There was a considerable falling off in the number of such cases, since in the year 1928-29 there were 1,558 admittances. A Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was as usual sent to the Dangs for a period of seven months during the year under report. He visited 228 villages and travelled 962 miles by road against 264 villages, and 1,122 miles during the preceding year. He attended 96 out-breaks of contagious diseases against 90 in the previous year. Of the out-breaks attended by him ninety-four were of Foot and Mouth disease and two of Black Quarter. He treated 1,687 animals for Foot and Mouth disease and protected 1,265 with Black Quarter aggressin or serum. In the course of his tours he treated 219 cases for non-contagious diseases and advised people on Veterinary matters. At Head Quarters he treated 19 cases and supplied medicines to 41 cases. 21. Buildings.24 The District Local Board, Satara, constructed a compound wall for their Veterinary Dispensary at Islampur. Accommodation for in-patients was provided at the dispensaries at Satana in Nasik District and Akola and Shevgaon in Ahmednagar District. Ratna- giri Veterinary Dispensary was removed from its old quarters to a new building which has been hired by the District Local Board, Ratnagiri. The District Local Board, West Khandesh, started the erection of the main buildings for their Veterinary Dispensary at Shirpur towards the end of the year and they will soon be ready for occupation. III.25 by the Veterinary Inspectors as they were largely engaged on epidemic work. In addition to their regular duties they inspected 13 tonga lines and visited 26 Panjrapoles. They also attended 17 cattle markets and 8 fairs and shows in their Divisions. As a whole, the staff worked well. Many cases of illness occur- red owing to the excessive strain put upon the men in dealing with epidemics. The names of the following men are brought to the notice of Government for good work.

Six dogs died of Piroplasmosis cut of 30 attacked. Parasitic Gastritis among goats and sheep prevailed in the districts of Karachi, Hyderabad (Sind), Thar Parkar, Sukkur, Larkana and Nawabshah districts and caused the death of 4,986 animals out of 5,459 attacked. (iv) Preventive Inoculations. 19. Table II.44 previous year. The decrease in the number of patients treated is partly due to heavy floods and partly to the fact that in previous years the number of castrations were added in the number of in and out-patients but from this year the castration cases have been omitted from the figures of in and out-patients and shown separately. III45 on tour and travelled 3,238 miles by rail and 537 miles by road.

The work of Veterinary Inspector Ansari, Upper Sind Circle, in dealing with widespread outbreaks of rinderpest in the Larkana district was commendable. Veterinary Inspector Haji of the Lower Sind Circle did some excellent work investigating a disease called "Phet". On the whole the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons worked well during the year under report.

Of the 144 students on the rolls at the commencement of the 1st Session (June) three students discontinued the course on account of illness and family circumstances, one died, one proceeded to Europe for higher education and two were expelled from the College. There were thus 137 students' names on the rolls at the end of the year as against 130 at the commencement. 7. There were 11 scholarships vacant at the commencement of the Collegiate year, viz., 6 for youths from the Presidency proper and 5 for youths from Sind. Of the 6 vacancies from the Presidency proper, 4 were due to 4 scholars having graduated in April and 2 were due to 2 scholarships having been withdrawn as the students failed to pass their examination. Of the 5 vacancies from Sind, 4 were due to 4 scholars having graduated in April and one had been vacant since the previous year. The Principal awarded 6 scholarships to students from the Presidency proper and the Commissioner in Sind sent 5 new scholars. There were in all 14 scholars from the Presidency proper and 6 from Sind. The Central Provinces Government continued stipends to 24 scholars already studying at the College and sent 21 more scholars. Jammu and Kashmir Government continued stipends to their 4 scholars. Baroda and Gwalior States continued stipends to their scholars. In addition, the States of Bhavnagar, Bansda and Chhota- Udepur each sent one scholar. There were thus 74 students in receipt of some assistance and 63 without such assistance at the end of the year. 8. The Students' Hostel.5 rudeness and insubordination to their teachers and to expel two students one for persistent neglect of study and the other on account of a criminal offence. Towards the close of the year a much better tone prevailed but naturally the consequences of neglect of study will be reflected in the examination results of next year. 14. Clinical Instruction.6 17.

No. 7681 of 1931. CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, POONA: Poona, 31st July 1931. From E. S. FARBROTHER, Esq., M.R.C.V.S, I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.19 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1930-31. I continued to hold charge of the Department throughout the year. I was on tour for eighty-nine days and travelled 1.8 2 miles by road and 4,764 miles by rail. During the course of my tours I visited 14 districts, inspected 46 Hospitals and Dispensaries, selected sites for seven dispensaries and attended ten outbreaks of Rinderpest. I visit d the Northcote Cattle Breeding Farm at Chharodi and inoculated eighty-one head of cattle against Rinder- pest by the Serum Simultaneous Method and also made arrangements at the Government Farm, Surat, for the stock there to be inoculated. As usual, I presided at the Annual Examinations at the Bombay Veterinary College and also conducted the supplementary examinations at the College in October. 2. Mr. Y. N. Marathe, Veterinary Inspector, Ahmednagar Division, acted as Deputy Superintendent and Personal Assistant from April 1st to December 23rd. He was on tour for fourteen days and travelled 276 miles by road and 1,234 miles by rail. He visited 13 villages in connection with outbreaks of Rinderpest. He proceeded on leave from December 24th and Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy who had been acting as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, resumed his permanent appointment on January 3rd, 1931 and continued to hold it until the end of the year. He was on tour for two days, travelled 9 miles by road and 258 miles by rail and visited the Chembur branch of the Bombay Pinjrapole. I20 Surra.21 Contagious Diseases in other Animals. 12. Seventy-nine cases of Foot and Mouth disease in sheep and goats were reported with no mortality. Twenty-seven sheep were attacked by and died from Anthrax. Twenty-two goats were attacked by goat-pox and 1 died. Twenty-five deaths occurred from rabies of which 21 were confirmed by microscopical examination of the brains. Seventy- four attacks and 48 deaths occurred from other diseases. Preventive Measures. Table II. 13. Two hundred and two thousand three hundred and twenty- eight animals were protected against various diseases compared with 1,57,149 in the previous year. Rinderpest.22 Other Diseases. Table III. 18. During the year 5,423 villages were visited by the Subordi- nate staff against 5,367 in the previous year. During these visits, 16,802 cases were treated for contagious diseases and 12,139 for non-contagious diseases. There was a very considerable reduction in the number of cases treated for contagious diseases when compared with the previous year due to the fact that foot and mouth disease was not so preva- lent during the year under report. Twelve thousand, three hundred and sixty animals were castrated on tour against 9,152 in the previous year. Investigation. 19. Three hundred and four specimens were sent to the Bombay Veterinary College for examination and 197 post-mortem examina- tions were conducted for diagnostic purposes. Sixty post-mortem exa- minations were conducted for medico legal purposes and in 13 cases poison was detected by the Chemical Analyser to Government. The brains of 36 dogs suspected to have died of rabies were sub- mitted for microscopical examination and the disease was confirmed in 21 cases. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table IV. 20. There were 105 hospitals and dispensaries excluding that maintained in the Dangs during the fair season, at the beginning of the year. It was intended to open three more during the course of the year, but for financial reasons this was not possible, and the number therefore remained the same to the end of the year. There was some increase in the number of in and out-patients treated, the number being 1,12,471 against 1,59,335 in the previous year. Medicines were supplied for home treatment in 43,317 cases, this number being 5,031 less than in the previous year. Twenty-four thousand four hundred and eighty-one castrations were performed at head-quarters, this being an increase of 5,350 over 1929-30. Five hundred and eighty cases were sent to infirmaries under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals against 853 last year. As usual, a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was deputed to the Dangs for a period of seven months. During this period he visited 213 villages and travelled 654 miles by road. Seven outbreaks of Rinderpest were reported, but preventive inoculation was refused. He protected 1,543 head of cattle against Black-quarter by inocula- tion with aggressin. He treated 22 cases for contagious diseases and 61 for non-contagious diseases and supplied medicine to 29 cases.
