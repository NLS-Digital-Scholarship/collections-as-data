Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR 1889-90. time elapsed before they could be posted to their respective districts and the system brought into full working order. Considering the time these men were at work the results are not unsatisfactory. Twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and seven persons were vaccinated and a percentage of successful cases of 82.68 was obtained in primary cases. In Shwebo and Minbu, however, where vaccinators were employed throughout the year, the average number of vaccinations performed by each man was only 69 and 80, the average for the province being 1,143. The causes of these bad results should be more carefully enquired into. The Civil Surgeon at Shwebo reports that the small number of operations was due to the repeated failure of the lymph supplies. If by this it is meant that the lymph-supply was bad, it is a serious matter. When speaking to the people on the subject of vaccination the Chief Commissioner has been told by them, both in Upper and Lower Burma, that they have found by experience that vaccinated children were not protected from smallpox. The supply of bad lymph to districts in Upper Burma will give vaccination a bad name and render progress very difficult. It is not worth while employing vaccinators to do this amount of work and the Chief Commissioner trusts that the short- comings noticed may be at once reformed. The average cost of each vaccination performed in Upper Burma was only 4¾ annas. 3. During the year under report Surgeon-Major Barclay's report on animal vaccination was circulated to Medical Officers in the province and the Sanitary Commissioner was requested to take measures, in accordance with the injunctions of the Government of India, for the supply of animal lymph and the establish- ment of depôts for its cultivation. After perusal of the reports submitted by the Sanitary Commissioner and certain Medical Officers the Chief Commissioner decided that the establishment of depôts for the preparation of lymph could not be taken in hand until it was proved that the activity of the lymph could be maintained in this province for a considerable period. Hitherto experience has gone to show that after the lapse of a few days or even hours the lymph loses its power unless kept in the form of crusts, a method of preservation of which Dr. Barclay strongly disapproved. Accordingly further experiments to obtain infor- mation with regard to the possibility of effectually preserving lymph were ordered and are at present being made. The Chief Commissioner hopes that during the current year some means may be found to overcome the difficulties described above and to enable the Sanitary Commissioner to start a depôt for the culti- vation of animal lymph from which supplies may be furnished to vaccination officers throughout the province. The Chief Commissioner has read with interest Dr. Sinclair's remarks on the increased willingness of the Burmans to accept vaccination. He thinks that much of the opposition to vaccination is due to the ignorance and fears of the people worked upon by the inoculators, whose means of livelihood are lessened by the spread of vaccination. Much good has been done by winning over some of these inoculators and instructing them how to vac- cinate, and appointing them vaccinators. Care, however, should be taken to prevent these men resorting once more to inoculation to eke out their supply of vaccine lymph. By order of the Chief Commissioner, H. L. EALES, Officiating Secretary.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1889-90. LOWER BURMA. THE Vaccination Report, which has previously been included in the Sanitary Report, is on this occasion, for the first time, submitted separately. Particulars of the number of operations and the results obtained are fully set forth in Statement No. I. 2. During the year under report 120,552 persons were vaccinated, an excess of 27,638 cases over the previous year. In nearly every district greater activity is observable, more particularly in the Thôngwa, Toungoo, Henzada, and Prome districts. The very marked increase in the total number operated on in the Toungoo district, which from 215 in 1887-88 rose to 5,126 and 8,905 in the past two seasons, is most satisfactory. Of the total operations 99,660 resulted suc- cessfully as against 73,952 in 1888-89. Besides the number shown in the Ap- pendix, 1,148 cases were vaccinated during the year 1889-90 in the Rangoon Central Jail, of which 1,057 were successful, 67 unsuccessful, and 24 doubtful cases. 3. There were 95,310 cases of primary and 25,242 of secondary vaccination against 73,249 and 19,665 respectively in the previous year. Of those primarily protected 66,265 were children under six years of age. While there has been no great change in the percentage of successful cases of primary vaccination2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. 6. Statement No. II gives details concerning establishment, the sources whence funds are obtained, and the average cost of successful cases. 7. The expenditure under the head &quot; Establishment &quot; is Rs. 23,369 against Rs. 22,746 during the previous year, the increase of Rs. 623 being due to the larger number of vaccinators employed. To the same reason in part, but mainly to the vigour with which vaccination has been pushed, must be attribut- ed the excess, amounting to Rs. 477, disbursed as travelling allowances. The total cost was met as follows: Rs. 16,148 from Local funds, Rs. 11,797 from Municipal funds, Rs. 830 received from Government. 8. The cost of each successful case ranged from 10 annas 8 pies in the Hill Tracts, Northern Arakan, to 1 anna 7 pies in Toungoo; the average cost for the province was 4 annas 7 pies against 6 annas in 1888-89. 9. Except at Kyaukpyu, where there has been a slight rise (5 annas 4 pies against 5 annas 1 pie), the cost of a successful case has diminished in every district. The decrease is very noteworthy in the Shwegyin, Sandoway, and Tavoy districts. The cost of each successful case in the Toungoo district, which was Rs. 3-9-5 in 1887-88, is now less than that paid in any other district. A satisfactory reduc- tion in the cost of successful cases is shown in the Arakan Hill Tracts, where the amount has fallen from Rs. 1-10-4 in 1888-89 to 10 annas 8 pies in 1889-90. 10. In Statement No. III particulars of dispensary vaccination are given. The total number of cases operated on was 4,400 against 4,187 in the previous year. The proportion of success in primary operations is inferior to that returned by the regular establishment. 11. Statement No. IV shows the numbers of primary operations per- formed during each of the past ten years by the establishments maintained by Municipal, local, and other funds. UPPER BURMA. 12. Vaccination has during the year 1889-90 received considerable at- tention. The number of vaccinators at work in the previous year was nine, four of whom were paid by the Mandalay Municipality, one by the Pyinmana dis- trict fund, and four by Government. Early in May sanction to the employment of a vaccinator in each district not already provided with one was accorded. The districts to which the above sanction applied were Bhamo, Katha, Ruby Mines, Upper Chindwin, Magwe, Pakôkku, Yamèthin, Meiktila, and to the Mogaung subdivision, which was in charge of a separate Civil Medical Officer. As the full number of vaccinators could not be obtained at once probationers were entertained and trained at Mandalay, and whilst under instruction received Rs. 8 per mensem. 13. The months in which vaccinators joined those districts are given below. Katha and Meiktila ... ... ... June 1889. Yamèihin ... ... ... ... May 1889. Ruby Mines ... ... ... July 1889. Upper Chindwin Bhamo Magwe Pakôkku Mogaung ... ... ... ... February 1890. For Mogaung no man could be obtained on the pay offered, Rs. 15 rising to Rs. 20 by annual increments of Re. 1, and the vaccinator at Bhamo had eventually to be transferred to Mogaung when it was found possible to replace him. 14. As a temporary measure sanction to the entertainment of a vaccinator at Amarapura was also obtained in April 1889; this vaccinator continued to work throughout the year. For want of funds the vaccinator previously employed at Pyinmana was discharged in March 1889 ; but, on a representation made to the Deputy Commissioner, two vaccinators for the town and two for the district were engaged as a temporary measure, and work was resumed about the middle of January last.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1880-90. 3 15. In November 1889 sanction to the entertainment of two vaccinators, one at Gangaw and the other at Fort Stedman, was obtained. It was not, however, till January and February 1890 that the men joined their appoint- ments at Fort Stedman and Gangaw respectively, men previously nominated having fallen sick on the way and returned. 16. Statement No. I shows the average number of vaccinators em- ployed during the year and the result of vaccine operations. Twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and seven operations were performed as against 20,348 (15,685 by vaccinators and 4,663 by Medical Officers) in 1888-89. Had it been possible to start work earlier in all districts far better results would have been possible, but through the delay caused by having to train men, and in some cases to those appointed failing to join, several months passed without any- thing being done. Difficulty was experienced especially at Mogaung, where work did not commence till the 20th February 1890. 17. The largest number of operations is returned from the Mandalay dis- trict (9,775), where six vaccinators were at work; but the best results were obtained in the Upper Chindwin district, where the one vaccinator employed operated on 4,086 cases, of which 92.76 per cent. are returned as successful. The next largest number is returned by the Myadaung district (2,118). 18. The number of operations in the Shwebo (69), Minbu (80), and Bhamo (161) districts is altogether insufficient. The Bhamo figures do not include 215 operations in the Mogaung subdivision, of which 195 were primarily success- ful ; the remaining 20 were successful on re-vaccination. Further particulars of these operations have not been received, hence they have not been included in Statement No. I. The Civil Surgeon, Bhamo, remarks that the supply of lymph does not appear to have been of good quality and that difficulty has been experienced in getting subjects for vaccination as the Chinese section of the community will not readily consent, and the Shans and Kachins do not fear smallpox As with lymph sent from Bhamo 215 operations were performed by the Civil Surgeon, Mogaung, during the remaining one month and eight days of the year with, as already noted, 195 primarily successful cases, it seems hardly fair to attribute the poverty of the results to the quality of the lymph. The cause must be looked for elsewhere, and there appears to be no reason why, if the Civil authorities lend their aid, good results may not be obtained at Bhamo. The Civil Surgeon, Shwebo, attributes the small number of operations to the repeated failure of lymph supplies, while the Civil Surgeon, Minbu, merely refers to the larger number of operations in his district as compared with the previous year, and remarks that more will seek protection as the people begin to see the advantages of vaccination. 19. The average number of operations by each vaccinator was highest in Ye-u (1,984), Mogaung (2,118), and Upper Chindwin (4,086) districts, and the smallest averages in the Bhamo (161), Minbu (80), and Shwebo (69) districts. 20. Of the number of primary operations (29,630) in Statement No. I 24,497 proved successful, and of 77 re-vaccinations 65 were successful. The per- centage of success in primary vaccination was 82.68 and in re-vaccination 84.42. 21. In Statement No. II is shown the expenditure on establishments, the sources from which paid, and the average cost of each successful case. The cost per successful case compared with Lower Burma is only 2 pies more and, but for the higher cost at Minbu (Rs. 5-13-8), Bhamo (Rs. 2-8-6), and Shwebo (Rs. 2-8-7), would have been considerably less. 22. In Statement No. III the dispensary vaccination is exhibited. Three thousand five hundred and thirty-four operations were performed, of which 3,440 were primary cases and 94 were cases of re-vaccination. The percentage of success in primary cases was 81.66 and in re-vaccinations 61.70. 23. Of the total number of successful primary dispensary operations 1,830 were on children under six years of age and 979 on subjects above that age. At Ye-u, Myingyan, and Pakôkku dispensary vaccination was confined chiefly to children, 312, 151, and 114 respectively being subjects under six years of age, while the number of persons vaccinated above that age were 72, 34, and 23 respectively.
4 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. GENERAL REMARKS. 24. Although the past three years have not been distinguished by any remarkable increase in the number of vaccine operations, it is satisfactory to note that the figures indicate a steady and progressive extension. The reports of Superintendents of Vaccination show that such prejudices as the Burmese entertain against vaccination and in favour of inoculation as a prophylactic are surely disappearing before the apparent fact that, while vaccination confers a comparative immunity against smallpox, it is attended with less inconvenience and risk than inoculation. An interesting example of this is furnished by the Civil Surgeon of Sandoway. In the little village of Khramaung, about 5 miles from the town, some persons who had been vaccinated, but who had but little faith in the efficacy of the operation as a protection, sent for the sayas to inoculate them. They were inoculated five days after the vaccination, but without result. In each case inoculation was repeated three or four times and with the same result. This was a test case and appealed to the understand- ing of the villagers, ruined the reputation of the sayas, and induced the headmen for a considerable distance round Sandoway to make earnest appeals to the Civil Surgeon to send vaccinators to their villages.* 25. That, save in the presence of an epidemic of smallpox, the people in the districts are for the most part averse to vaccination cannot be denied, and for several reasons, the following among others. Like more advanced peoples, the improvident Burmese are not wishful to take out an insurance against a contingent possibility. Again, the results obtained by vaccinators in districts are not always satisfactory, and in the very malarious districts, where the chil- dren are weakly and anæmic, the vesicles, unless carefully tended, are prone to develop ulcers followed by secondary abcesses. There can be no doubt also that inoculation is sometimes practised in the guise of vaccination; indeed in Nga- thainggyaung so much do the people fear that vaccination will induce smallpox that a vaccinator appearing in a village which is free from the disease stands in danger of being roughly handled. But the greatest obstacle in the way of vaccination is the authority exercised by the sayas, whose living depends on their practise of inoculation. These men have great influence and readily persuade the people that vaccination not only does not ward off an attack of smallpox, but itself exercises a most baneful influence on such as are operated upon. In the more remote districts, where presumably the practice of inocu- lation is not lucrative, the people take very kindly to vaccination. 26. While the sayas lead the popular mind against vaccination they them- selves have no objection, theoretical or other, to the operation; indeed, in several districts they have been employed as vaccinators as it was hoped that, seeing the change of faith in their teachers, the people themselves might be converted. The experiment has been tried in Thôngwa, Tharrawaddy, Henzada, and Prome. At Shwedaung in the Prome district the mortality among those inoculated was so great (8 per cent. of those operated upon) that special efforts were made to stop the practice, but so infatuated were the people that it was not until the Burmese officials took an active part in discouraging inoculation that it was put an end to. The inoculators, finding their occupation gone, applied to be permitted to vaccinate. They were thoroughly instructed and, efficient measures having been devised for the proper control of their proceedings, permission was granted. It is pleasing to find that the Civil Surgeon is able to report very favourably of them. 27. There is good reason to fear that the practice of inoculation frequently lights up an epidemic of smallpox in a district which would otherwise probably escape the disease and, although an injustice would be done were inoculation put down where the benefits of the milder operation are inaccessible, it is evident that the two proceedings yield bad results when practised side by side, and in districts where free vaccination is obtainable by any one who desires it the intro- * This case recalls the instance reported in page 12 of the Report on the Sanitary Administration, British Burma, for 1884.

There would be little resistance to its enforcement and vaccination would speedily become popular by the conclusive exhibition of the protection against smallpox which it bestows. In the towns where the Vaccination Act is in force the Civil Surgeons speak in grateful terms of the good effects produced and state that for the carrying out of its provisions legal proceedings are very seldom required. In Rangoon, it is true, the people are very lax in their attendance with their children to have the results of the operation verified, but this laxity is most noticeable among the Eurasians and Natives of India.

The department is again greatly indebted to Dr. Pedley for the in- terest he has taken in carrying on vaccination in the town of Rangoon and for the gratuitous services in connection with the cultivation of calf lymph which he has rendered since the depôt was started. I have much pleasure in recom- mending this officer to the favourable notice of the Chief Commissioner. The interest in the cause of vaccination taken by Surgeon C. S. Rundle, Toungoo, and Dr. C. G.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1890-91. In Bhamo, Minbu, and Magwe the outturn was &quot;bad in quantity or quality, or both; it was also bad in the previous year and, as the fault must rest chiefly with the vaccinators, the advisability of replacing them by new men should be con- sidered. In the Shan States vaccination makes little progress. Some of the Chiefs are positively opposed to it and the mass of the people are indifferent if not hostile. Still it is not understood why the vaccinator in the Northern Shan States, whose appointment was sanctioned in December 1890, should have done no work at all. The cost of the Special Vaccination Department was Rs. 8,158 and the average cost of Rs. 0-4-2 per successful case compares favourably with Lower Burma. Too little verification is performed by Civil Surgeons in Upper Burma. Although the Civil Surgeon's work at Mandalay is heavy the Chief Commissioner considers that he should have found time to verify a few cases. In Myingyan, Sagaing, Gangaw, Kyauksè, Pyinmana, and the Upper Chinhdwin, where the Civil Surgeons verified a considerable number of cases, the percentage of successes among the vaccinators' cases was high. At the close of the year, on the 14th March 1891, the Vaccination Act was extended to Upper Burma; its application to the town of Mandalay has been already proposed, and its intro- duction into other towns and cantonments is under consideration. By order of the Chief Commissioner, F. C. GATES, Junior Secretary.

ii. CONTENTS. APPENDICES. A.RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1891-92. Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. Upper Burma. 2. The number of vaccinations in Upper Burma was 57,985 against37,956. There were four additional vaccinators en- tertained, but the average outturn of each vac- cinator's work rose from 1,356 to 1,812 operations. In Mandalay district there was a large increase of 10,722 owing mainly to the extension of the Act to Mandalay Municipality and Cantonment. In the Upper Chindwin there was a great and unexplained decrease, and from other districts, including Katha, Lower Chindwin, and Pyinmana, reports of opposition to vaccination were re- ceived. The assistance which can be rendered by the District Officer and his assistants in removing such opposition is illustrated by the case of Ye-u, where the number of vaccinations increased from 1,289 to 4,244, and Mr. Fryer ex- pects that Deputy Commissioners, Subdivisional Officers, and Township Officers will take every convenient opportunity of combating the unreasonable preju- dices which retard the spread of vaccination. The Officiating Chief Com- missioner is glad to observe that in Bhamo and Minbu the percentage of suc- cessful cases has risen; but in Magwe, though there is some improvement, the percentage of success is still the lowest in Upper Burma. In quantity and quality of work considered together the vaccinators at Myingyan come first and the vaccinator at Mogaung last. The cost of each successful case fell from Rs. 0-4-2 to Rs. 0-3-2. The total expenditure was Rs. 9,712. During the year the Act was applied to the Municipalities of Mandalay, Myingyan, Pagan, Salin, Pyinmana, and Yamèthin, and the Cantonment of Mandalay. Rules under the Act were made for the Municipalities of Mandalay,. Salin, and Pyin- mana. General. 3. The Civil Surgeons verified more cases than in the preceding year,and the Civil Surgeon of Mandalay, whose 919 veri- fications were accidentally omitted by the Sanitary Commissioner from the previous year's report, found time to verify over 3,000 cases in 1891-92. The high percentage of successful secondary vaccinations in 1890-91 attracted the notice of the Government of India, which was inclined to doubt the correctness of the returns. In the year of report the percentage fell in Lower Burma from 61 to 57 and rose in Upper Burma from 69 to 71. The Sanitary Commissioner has not offered any explanation of these figures. A full report on vaccination is not due till next year, and the Officiating Chief Commissioner considers that the notes of the Sanitary Commissioner are too ample and yet not sufficiently enlightening. In great part they consist of mere statements of fact extracted from the returns and of tables which repro- duce figures found elsewhere. These might have been omitted with advantage ; the bulk of the report might have been reduced by half at least, and part of the space thus gained might have been devoted to explaining marked differences between the returns of the year of report and those of the preceding year. By order of the Chief Commissioner, D. H. R. TWOMEY, Officiating Junior Secretary.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1891-92. LOWER BURMA. THE following statement shows the strength of establishment employed during the years 1890-91 and 1891-92 :2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. 5. One hundred and twenty-nine thousand five hundred and nine persons have been vaccinated during the year against 140,321 in 1890-91 and 120,552 in 1889-90, showing a decrease of 10,812 on the former and an increase of 8,957 on the latter year. There is a decrease in the number of operations performed in the Arakan (30), Pegu (5,798), and Irrawaddy (6,764) divisions, and an in- crease in the Tenasserim (1,780) division. 6. Arakan DivisionREPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. 3 10. The ratio of males to females operated on remains approximately the same as last year. In all the districts with the solitary exception of Mergui males preponderate. In the Hanthawaddy district males are to females as 5 to 1: this disproportion is attributed to the large number of coolies vaccinated in Rangoon Town. 11. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator is 1,962 against 2,159, 2,009, and 1,659 of the three preceding years. The following districts show an increase:4 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. 20. The following table contrasts the work performed during 1890-91 with that of 1891-92 :REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. 5 26. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popu- lation has increased from 10.57 to 14.37. 27. The average cost of each successful case was Re. 0-3-2 as against Re. 0-4-2 in 1890-91 and Re. 0-4-9 in 1889-90. The cost ranges from Re. 1-1-5 in the Northern Shan States, Re. 0-14-5 in Mogaung, Rs. 0-8-10 in Meiktila to Re. 0-1-5 in Ye-u and Mingyan, and Re. 0-1-4 in Upper Chindwin. 28. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator has increased from 1,143 in 1889-90, 1,356 in 1890-91, to 1,812 in 1891-92. The increase varies from 2,955 in Yeu, 1,531 in Mandalay, 1,342 in Sagaing, to 156 in Minbu, 132 in Shwebo, and 140 in Mogaung. The following districts show a decrease in the average number of oper- ations performed:6 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. 43.

During the year experiments with preparations of vaccine paste have been continued at Rangoon, Mandalay, Moulmein, and Thayetmyo. 47. The Health Officer, Rangoon, reports that since June 1890 he has used a preparation of bovine vaccine paste, prepared by mixing lymph and scraping from the floor of the vesicles with glycerine. He states that in his hands this preparation has given more reliable results than lymph obtained from bovine or human vaccinifers, but that specimens sent to other Surgeons have yielded only &quot; varied success.&quot; 48. The Civil Surgeon, Moulmein, remarks that calf lymph has been used throughout the year, and that every care was taken to keep up the supply by means of bovine scabs and inoculating calves with human lymph. Surgeon- Major King's method of preserving bovine lymph in lanoline was tried on several occasions, but he states that it did not show any superiority over bovine scabs. In a supplementary report he remarks that &quot; After repeated experiments &quot; with lanoline lymph, the reason why the paste was not extensively experi- &quot; mented with on children was due to the uncertainty of its possessing the vaccine &quot; virtue and for fear of failure, which would act as a deterrent to vaccination, &quot; especially in a place where vaccination is carried on under compulsory and not &quot; on voluntary applications.&quot; 49. At Thayetmyo the Civil Surgeon experienced great difficulty in pro- curing calves for the operation. He states that the milkmen and butchers would not allow their calves to be vaccinated for fear of losing them, and that it was only from the jail dairy farm and local contractors that calves could be ob- tained. He remarks that out of 12 experiments four did not take at all, and of the &quot; eight successful cases the quality of the lymph was not successful and the quantity small.&quot; 50. At Akyab calf lymph was used till February, when on account of a severe outbreak of cholera all vaccination had to be discontinued. With regard to the preservation of calf lymph the Civil Surgeon remarks: &quot; The method of &quot; triturating with glycerine was tried, and also Dr. King's method of rubbing the &quot; lymph with lanoline, but with only comparative success.&quot;
8 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1891-92. The longest time he was able to preserve lymph for was nine days, and he is of opinion that the only method of utilizing calf lymph effectively is either to vaccinate direct from the calf on the fourth or the fifth day, or else to store the lymph in tubes for not longer than 24 hours, and that only young calves should be used. 51. At Mandalay at headquarters animal lymph was used throughout the year and human lymph was collected for despatch to out-stations. Four hundred and seventy tubes of fresh human lymph and 165 grains of lanoline paste prepared by Dr. King's method were sent to outstations. In the majority of cases the results reported of both preparations were satisfactory. The Civil Surgeon states that the results obtained from lanoline paste have been somewhat variable, and thinks this may have been due to some defect in the method of preparation; but he remarks that greater success has attended the use of the lanoline paste than of any other form of preserved lymph known to him. 52. These reports are so conflicting that at present no definite conclusions can be drawn as to the relative merits of the various preparations. Not only do the&quot; opinions of the Medical Officers differ widely regarding the best method of cultivation and storage of animal lymph, but the results obtained by individual officers at different times with the same preparation have been very variable. 53. As regards experiments with lanoline vaccine there can, I think, be little doubt that want of success has been in some measure due to the fact that the correct method of preparation has not been strictly pursued. This is ad- mitted at all events by Surgeon-Major Dantra, who had opportunities of seeing the process carried out by Surgeon-Major King. The latter officer, in a very able and interesting note attached to the Annual Vaccination Report for Man- dalay, points out at some length the numerous causes which may lead to failure in the cultivation of animal lymph by this method, and concludes by saying that if it is determined to use animal lymph in this country, it is not advisable to trust to its production in small scattered depôts. He recommends that a single, well-organized vaccine institute be formed, the functions of which would be the supply of lymph sufficient for ordinary demands and for epidemics. 54. It must be admitted by all who have had practical experience in the matter that considerable care, skill, and experience are required for the success- ful cultivation and preservation of animal lymph, and that the necessary pro- cesses can only be carried out to perfection in a central depôt suitably provided with a resident professional and working staff. At the same time it is a fact that in this province calf vaccination has proved very fairly successful in the hands of those Medical Officers who have resorted to it, and even when con- ducted intermittently it has been found to be of the greatest service in the way of securing and maintaining a pure lymph supply. If further experience, how- ever, should bear out Surgeon-Major King's contention that lymph properly preserved in lanoline will retain its full activity for several months, there should, in my opinion, be no hesitation in establishing a large central vaccine depôt here, which would supply all the requirements of the province. 55. My thanks are due to Dr. Sutherland, Health Officer, Rangoon Muni- cipality, for his willing help in the cultivation and distribution of bovine lymph and paste. P. W.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA 3,000, the maximum for the province being reached in Magwe, where the number was 4,596. Of the districts mentioned above, the percentage of success in San- doway (72.91) and Magwe (76.05) was very low and should have been explained in the report. In the Pegu and Thôngwa districts in Lower Burma and the Katha and Ruby Mines districts of Upper Burma there was a large falling off. Looking to the general progress in vaccination work throughout the province, the Chief Commissioner finds it difficult to believe that the backwardness of these districts is due to any cause but want of energy on the part of the vaccinators or the local Superintendents of Vaccination. In the Katha district it is observed that the percentage of successful cases was the lowest in the province (50.93), and in the Pegu district it appears from Statement V in the appendix that the vaccinators' returns of successful cases do not well bear the test of inspection on the spot by the local Superintendents. It seems to the Chief Commissioner that the quality of the lymph and the class of vaccinators employed in these districts are alike in want of improvement. The table printed on page 5 of the report shows how much still remains to be done before the vaccination work of the province can be regard- ed as adequate. In four districts of Lower Burma the proportion of successful vaccinations of children under one year old in 1892-93 was less than 10 per cent. of the number of infants living. The difference in this respect between the con- tiguous districts of Hanthawaddy and Pegu, both adjoining Rangoon, is very striking. In Hanthawaddy the percentage was 76.05, while in Pegu it was only 5.28. The Chief Commissioner is aware of no difference in the circumstances of the two districts which satisfactorily accounts for this divergence. Vaccination in Municipalities. 2. The Vaccination Act was during the year 1892-93 extended to the PeguMunicipality in Lower Burma and to the Pakôkku, Taungdwingyi, and Mônywa Municipalities in Upper Burma. It is now in force in all the large Municipalities of the province and in most of the smaller ones. The table printed on page 4 of the report gives a general view of the extent of vaccination in the Municipal towns of Lower Burma and shows that, on the whole, the infant population is fairly protected in these towns. It would have been interesting if similar information had been given for the towns in Upper Burma to which the Act has been applied, and if the Superin- tendent of Vaccination had complied with the request, made at the instance of the Government of India, that the results of vaccination work in Municipal towns should be exhibited in a statement similar to that printed on page 2 of the report. The Chief Commissioner requests that these defects may be remedied in the report for the current year. Expenditure. 3. The special establishment maintained for vaccination was the same in1892-93 as in the preceding year. There was one more vaccinator in Upper Burma and one less in Lower Burma. In Upper Burma the aggregate expenditure rose from Rs. 9,712 in 1891-92 to Rs. 11,971 in 1892-93 mainly owing to the increased amount drawn as travelling allowances and also apparently owing to the payments of increments to the vaccinators. In Lower Burma the total expenditure decreased from Rs. 32,663 to Rs. 31,253. In Upper Burma the expenditure on rural vacci- nation has hitherto been partly defrayed from the district funds, but it has now been decided that it is not a proper charge against these funds, and the expendi-

Dispensary vaccinations; Super- intendence. 4. There was a considerable falling off in dispensary vaccination in bothUpper and Lower Burma owing to the extension of the Vaccination Act to the towns in which dispensary vaccinations were formerly most numerous. These dispensaries have now been appointed vaccination centres under the Act, and the record of operations is entered in the general returns. In most districts a fair proportion of operations was verified by the Medical Officers, but in some the number of verifications is small and in others the work of inspection has been left too much to medical subordinates. The Chief Commissioner hopes to see an improvement next year. In the Lower Chindwin especially it seems that the vac- cinator's work required more thorough examination. It is observed that no veri- fications are shown as having been performed in Rangoon and Hanthawaddy. The Chief Commissioner presumes that this important matter has not been neg- lected in the headquarters district of the province and that the omission is due to the absence of a record of inspections. Full information should be given in the return for the current year. Vaccination in the Shan States. 5. The Chief Commissioner notices with regret the falling off in the quantityand quality of the work done in the Shan States. There is reason to think that the supplies of lymph were inadequate and inferior in quality. Seeing that the Shan Chiefs and the people of the States are for the most part well disposed towards vaccination, no effort should be spared to push forward the work. The proposals regarding the establishment of a vaccine depôt for the Southern Shan States should not be delayed. 6. The Chief Commissioner is not inclined to support the Superintendent's suggestion that the practice of inoculation should be punished criminally in the Pegu district or in any other rural area. There is no reason to believe that the mortality from small-pox in Burma is on the increase. In 1892 the number of deaths from small-pox registered in Lower Burma was 1,463, of which 1,114 occurred in the two districts of Akyab and Pegu. It appears certain that the excessive mortality in both these districts was due to the neglect of vaccination during recent years. It is more expedient to destroy the alleged popularity of the inoculators in rural areas by steadily pushing vaccination, and satisfying the people of its efficacy, than to treat them as offenders against the criminal law. The plan of instructing inoculators in the method of vaccination and employing them as vaccinators should also be persevered in. The Chief Commissioner believes that where it fails, the cause must be looked for rather in the Medical Officers' lack of energy than in the perversity of the operators. By order of the Chief Commissioner, D. H. R. TWOMEY, Officiating Secretary.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1890-91 TO 1892-93. 3 *Akyab. Bassein. Kyaukpyu. Henzada. Hanthawaddy. Thayetmyo. Pegu. Mergui. Prome. Toungoo. Thôngwa. Comparing the work of 1889-90 with that done in 1890-91, an improvement is noticeable in all districts in the number of operations performed during the latter year, except Sandoway, Henzada, Toungoo, and Salween. This decrease was referred to in the brief report forwarded with the annual statements for that year. Looking to district figures for the three past years, it will be observedthat in 11* out of the 18 districts the operations for 1891-92 were less than for 1890-91. In the Kyauk- pyu district the decrease was slight (65 less). In Bassein the falling off was only apparent, not real, and was due to the exclusion of operations in the jail as explained in the notes accompanying the state- ments for that year. The causes which led to the diminution in the other dis- tricts were also noticed at the time. Since then an improvement has taken place in all districts except Pegu, Prome, Thôngwa, Amherst, and Salween Hill Tracts. In Pegu and Thôngwa the decrease has been considerable and steady for the past two years. In Prome the difference between the figures of the two last years is trifling (52). In Amherst and the Salween Hill Tracts the operations performed in 1892-93 were less than those for the previous year by 2,289 and 379 respectively. The decrease in the Pegu district is due to the presence of a large number of private vaccinators. These men qualify themselves as vaccinators by working for a time under the Health Officer, Rangoon Municipality, and when they obtain a certificate that they are competent to vaccinate, they go into the district and oftener than not practise inoculation under the guise of vaccination. Pegu, Thôn- gwa, and Henzada seem to be the most favoured districts, Pegu pre-eminently so, as frequent applications are made to me for permits to practise there. At first permission was given on the understanding that the applicants would obtain their supplies of lymph through the Civil Surgeon of the district and furnish that officer occasionally with a list showing the number and names of those operated on in order that he might verify the cases. This they entirely omitted to do, and District Medical Officers invariably report that, armed with these permits and the original certificates of qualification, these vaccinators resort to inoculation. I received a strong representation on this subject from the Civil Surgeon, Pegu, last year, but as the practice of inoculation cannot be interdicted, nothing can be done. The people themselves favour inoculators and screen them as much as possible. In Thôngwa the decrease was due to the indifferent work of the vaccinators. There were three changes in the appointment of town vaccinator at Ma-ubin during the year owing to unsatisfactory work, and in the district the Pantanaw vaccinator, who was removed in May, was not replaced till the month of December. In the Amherst district, though the number of cases vaccinated was less in 1892-93 than for the previous year, which was unusually high, the number of operations by each vaccinator gives an average of over 2,200. In the previous year small-pox was more prevalent, and 7 calves had been vaccinated and conveyed to thickly populated neighbourhoods in response to applications for vaccination. Only 4 calves were so sent in 1892-93. In the Salween Hill Tracts district, owing to the presence of small-pox in the district, the hill tribes refused to allow any stranger into their villages for fear of infection. This is in marked contrast to the atti- tude of Karens in the settled districts, who eagerly accept the prophylactic, especially when small-pox is in the neighbourhood. The percentage of successes in primary vaccinations was 86.65 in 1892-93 as against 85.21 in 1891-92 and 85.38 in 1890-91. The percentage of success in re-vaccinations was 47.79 in 1892-93 as compared with 61.03 and 57.19 for the two previous years. In con- nection with the smaller number of secondary operations the Civil Surgeon, Ran- goon, remarks that the reason is the adoption in previous years of a faulty method of classification, whereby large numbers of children successfully vaccinated for the first time have been treated as re-vaccinated simply because they did not re- spond to the first operation. To call such cases re-vaccinations was both an error in judgment and an oversight of the instructions. In the following statement the average number of successful operations performed in towns on children under one year of age during the past three years and the number of births for a similar

Of the four remaining towns in respect of which figures are available, Shwedaung is the only one in which the infant population has been protected. Pegu is the most back- ward. The Act has not been extended to these four, nor can it be to the three last, as they are not Municipal towns. In the case of Pegu, however, there is no reason why it should not be. In the following table the same particulars as have been given in respect of towns are exhibited for the districts, excluding the towns above noted.

Small-pox is practically endemic in the Pegu district, and I would suggest that, in consideration of its proximity to Rangoon and the facilities which exist of affording complete protection to its population by means of private and public vaccinators, it be selected as one of the areas in which inoculation shall be prohi- bited by legislation, as was done in the districts of Kumaon and Ghurwal in India. The time has also come, I think, for the prohibition of inoculation in all large towns in which vaccinators are employed, as was done in Bengal when Act IV (Bengal) of 1865 was passed. For the good effects resulting from complete protection I need only to point to Rangoon. For the five years ending December 1884 the number of deaths from small-pox in the town amounted to 1,806, which gives an average of 361 per annum, while after the Vaccination Act was enforced, the total number of deaths from small-pox for the five years ending December 1889 was 68, or an annual average of 13 only.

8 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1890-91 TO 1892-93. The number of operations performed in 1892-93 exceeded the numbers for the two previous years by 40,035 and 20,006 respectively. All districts con- tribute to the increase except Katha, Ruby Mines, Ye-u and the Gangaw sub- division of the Pakôkku district. At Katha and Gangaw the number of operations has steadily declined for the past two years. In the former district vaccination is very unpopular, and other causes have conduced to lower the number, namely, the illness of the vaccinator for three months of the year, when work was almost at a standstill, and the refusal of the people to undergo the operation. In the Gangaw subdivision those in and about the town itself are induced to submit to the operation, but in the interior the inhabitants are opposed to it. The Medical Officer reports, however, that the prejudice of the people is gradually being overcome. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was 2,363 as compared with 2,402 in Lower Burma. In the Ruby Mines no Burman could be got to take up the appointment of vaccinator. A native of India was appointed, but he was eventually removed from the service as his work was unsatisfactory. For two months of the year there was no vaccinator in the district. To these causes and the opposition of the people was the falling off in operations due. The Civil Surgeon reports that the people are beginning to see that vaccination is not compulsory and they refuse to submit to it. The larger number vaccinated in Ye-u in 1891-92 as compared with the previous and succeeding years was due to operations performed on people congre- gated at the famine relief works in that year, but who have since dispersed.

Humanized lymph from Moulmein was supplied to the Medical Officers at Tavoy and Mergui and to Christian Missionaries in the district. The calf depot at Rangoon supplied Medical Officers of districts and others with 95 jars (each jar containing paste for 50 operations) of vaccine paste, 289 tubes of humanized and 342 of calf lymph during the year. Vaccine paste made by the Health Officer, Rangoon Municipality, from calf lymph mixed with glycerine, remains active long enough to enable it to be sent to all parts of the province, and it has been freely used. Vaccine paste prepared with lanoline was also obtained from Bangalore and tested by Medical Officers with varying success. Surgeon-Captain Basu, Civil Surgeon, Minbu, reports that paste made with lanoline produced more constitutional disturbance than human lymph, causing inflammation of the glands and eruption of boils. The Civil Surgeon, M6nywa, remarks that this paste gave a large percentage of failures. The experiments at Akyab and Moulmein with lanoline paste obtained from Bangalore gave 76.6 and 86.5 per cent. of successes. Instruction of Sayahs in Shan States.APPENDICES.

In November last the Superintendent was asked to consult Commissioners of Divisions about employing more vaccinators in rural tracts, but nothing has yet been settled. The record of inspections by Civil Surgeons leaves much to be desired, and it was not the busiest officers who devoted least time to this matter. The Civil Surgeon of Tharrawaddy, where there is no jail and in whose district communications are good, verified fewer cases than the Civil Surgeon of Toungoo. Apothecary Davis of Henzada verified only 78 cases. This officer has now left the province. As a general rule those districts in which least inspection was done showed the lowest percentage of cases found successful to cases inspected. The Chief Commissioner is satisfied neither with the amount of verification done nor with its results. Sir Alexander Mackenzie must insist that more attention shall be given to this part of a Civil Surgeon's duties. Upper Burma. 2. The number of vaccinations in Upper Burma was 98,726 as compared with 77,991 in the previous year. The increase was common to all Civil Surgeons' charges, except Man- dalay, Mônywa, Meiktila, and Myitkyina. The decrease at Mandalay is attributed to the resentment of the vaccinators against the appointment in June of a local Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination, and coercive measures had to be adopted to overcome their obstruction. At Mônywa, the Civil Surgeon was to blame. He kept unfilled for some time the appointment vacated by a vaccinator who had absconded. The backward state of vaccination at Meiktila was due to frequent changes of Civil Surgeons: the post was held by military surgeons as a collateral charge and they were unable to do the necessary work. In the Myitkyina sub- division the decrease was 23 only. A separate Civil Surgeon has been appointed to Mogaung, and it is hoped that the area of protection will be extended. The decrease in the number of vaccinations in the Northern Shan States as compared with the increase in the Southern Shan States may be attributed chiefly to the wild character of the Shans, Kachins, and Palaungs who form the bulk of the population in the former, and in some measure no doubt to the disturbed state of parts of the area. The Superintendent would do well to utilize Dr. Kirkpatrick's hospital at Hsipaw as a vaccine depôt and to enlist the enlightened sympathies of the Sawbwa of that State, who has now a European adviser to assist him in his administration, in the cause of vaccination. The percentage of success in primary vaccinations was 86.35, nearly the same as in the previous year ; while in re-vaccina- tions it fell, in consequence of greater care in classifying, from 73.61 to 44.73. The Meiktila district showed the poorest result both in percentage of success and in average number of operations per vaccinator. Improvement is also required in the Lower Chindwin and Magwe districts. From Statement V it would seem that the vaccinators' returns are more trustworthy in Upper than in Lower Burma. The reduction in the average number of vaccinations performed by each vacci- nator is not satisfactory, but the Chief Commissioner trusts that it will not be continued in the current year. As the strength of the establishment is in- creased, the total number of vaccinations should be increased in proportion. The cost of each successful case was 2 annas 11 pies as compared with 3 annas 9 pies in the Lower Province. It was highest in the Northern Shan States (Rs. 1-4-5) and lowest in Shwebo (8 pies). The total expenditure of the Vaccination De- partment in Upper Burma was Rs. 15,212, of which Imperial funds contributed
RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 3 Rs. 8,610 and municipal funds Rs. 6,602. The cost of vaccination in rural areas was transferred from District Funds to the Imperial budget, as the whole resources of the former were required for public works and other special objects for which they were created. The Vaccination Act was extended in the course of the year under report to the municipalities at Mônywa and Ye-u and has since been extended to others. The question of extending the Act to the cantonments of Bhamo, Myingyan, Shwebo and Meiktila is under consideration. The verifi- cation of vaccinations by Civil Surgeons was better done than in Lower Burma, but in Lower and Upper Chindwin, Myitkyina, Pakôkku, Magwe, Myingyan, Yamèthin and Meiktila it was insufficient. The result at Kyauksè is surprising. The number of persons vaccinated was 3,019; the vaccinator declared 2,869 cases to be successful ; the Civil Surgeon inspected 2,040 cases and declared only 141 to be successful. Sir Alexander Mackenzie presumes that in this and in the similar cases in the Pegu, Tharrawaddy and Mandalay districts, the vaccinators concerned have been suitably dealt with. A report on the subject is desired. By order of the Chief Commissioner, F. C. GATES, Secretary.
REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1893-94. LOWER BURMA. 1. A detailed report on vaccination having been submitted last year, the following brief note is intended to explain, where necessary, the figures in the pre- scribed forms. Cantonment vaccination establishments having been handed over to the control of the Civil Department, their work is included in the annual statements. The population dealt with is that determined by the census of 1891. 2. Statement I. 2 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. The average in Hanthawaddy (6,143) comes next, but is below that of the previous year: this falling off is attributed to the deterioration of lymph in November and again in February and March. 8. The percentage of success in primary operations is 90.27 against 86.65 in the previous year and 85.21 in 1891-92. The degree of success ranged from 96.70 in Amherst, 96.40 in Prome, and 94.51 in Henzada to 81.59 in Mergui, 80.37 in Kyaukpyu, and 76.80 in Akyab. The falling off is attributed at Kyaukpyu to inexperience in the use of lanoline paste, and at Akyab to deterioration of the lymph supply previous to its failure in July. 9. There were 1,642 more cases of secondary vaccination than in 1892-93, but the percentage of success remained almost the same (47.57 against 47.79). 10. Statement II.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 3 Henzada, Moulmein, and eight others show successful vaccinations in excess of births, while Pegu, Akyab, and eight others are under-protected, the first two markedly so; the remainder are fairly protected and show vaccination in excess of survivals. At Pegu the hostility of Burmans to vaccination and the wide preva- lence of inoculation are the causes assigned for the bad work done there. As the Act was introduced into the town in March 1893 these reasons are not considered satisfactory, and the Civil Surgeon has been requested to take greater interest in vaccination. 16. In accordance with the wishes of the Government of India, contained in Home Department letter No. 191, dated the 26th August 1892, a table is given below, which shows the work done, the average cost of each successful vacci- nation, and the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator in Municipal towns during the year under review:4 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. The percentage of successful primary cases is greatest at Moulmein (99.97) and Toungoo (99.50) and least at Akyab (76.18) and Gyobingauk (78.30). The cost of each successful case is least at Henzada and Kyaukpyu (Rs. 0-1 -8 and Rs. 0-1-10 respectively) and greatest at Akyab and Pegu (Rs. 0-12-9 and Rs. 0-9-7). Rangoon returns the largest (7,013) and Pegu the smallest (559) average number of operations performed by each vaccinator. 17. Similar information to that contained in the preceding table is shown in the following for districts excluding Municipal towns:REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 5 Diagram showing the population protected during the five official years from 1889-90 to 1893-94 and the death-rate from small-pox during the calendar year 1893 in the districts of Lower Burma.

6 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. Until the amount of protection is much greater than at present and until in- accurate registration becomes less general, this table, which is supposed to show the benefits resulting from vaccination, can but imperfectly serve its purpose. 19. During the year of review the Vaccination Act (as already mentioned) was introduced into the town of Pegu. UPPER BURMA. 20. The number of vaccine operations performed in 1893-94 was 98,726, an increase of 20,735 on the total of the previous year. There is in reality an increase in all the divisions, though the transference of Myingyan from the Southern to the Eastern division causes in the former an apparent falling off, which is more than counterbalanced by the increase in the latter. 21. With the exception of Mandalay, Mônywa, Meiktila, and Myitkyina, in which a falling off is observable, all districts show, over the totals of the previous year, an increase, which is most marked at Shwebo (4,364), Kindat (3,491), Yamèthin (2,702), Sagaing (2,270), and Pakôkku (2,127). 22. The decrease at Mandalay (3,100) chiefly confined to the town, is attributed to the &quot; perversity and laziness &quot; of the vaccinators, who resented the appointment in June of an Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination and tried to work aganist him. Fines were inflicted, which, with threats of dismissal, are reported to have produced a salutary effect. The Civil Surgeon at Mônywa attributes the falling off (1,004) to the great difficulty in procuring efficient vaccinators for the district; one of the two men at his disposal absconded and the vacancy was not filled up for some time. Frequent changes of Civil Surgeons and the fact that the duties have for a considerable portion of the year been performed as a collateral charge by Military Surgeons, who cannot spare time to work up the district, account for the falling off and for the backward state of vaccination at Meiktila. The people are also reported as being unfavourably disposed to vaccination. At Myitkyina the decrease (23) is trifling, but the absence of progress is attributed to the illness of vaccinators and the tender-heartedness of parents objecting to see their children crying under the prick of the vaccination lancet. The Civil Surgeon reports that Shan-Burmans and Shan-Chinese do not look unfavourably on vaccination, but that the Kachins view it with suspicion. 23. The Southern Shan States return an increase as compared with the previous year, the Northern Shan States a decrease, which is attributed to the hos- tility of the people and the inability of the vaccinator to travel in the district without an escort. 24. The percentage of success in primary operations (86.35 as compared with 86.09 in the previous year) has slightly increased. 25. As the result of greater care in classification, the percentage of suc- cess in re-vaccinations has fallen from 73.61 to 44.73, the total number of secondary operations being 2,560 as compared with 3,774 in 1892-93. 26. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator has de- creased from 2,363 in the previous year to 2,146 in the year under review, the in- crease in the total number of vaccinations not having kept pace with the increase in the strength of the establishment. 27. Statement II.REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 7 report. The small number of re-vaccinations cannot entirely account for the high percentage of success (100), which must be looked on as a coincidence. 30. Statements IV and V speak for themselves. 31. A table for the towns in Upper Burma to which the Vaccination Act has been extended, similar to that at paragraph 15, cannot be submitted as regis- tration is not yet in force in these towns. 32. A table for Municipal towns in Upper Burma, similar to that for Lower Burma, seen at paragraph 16, is given below:8 REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94.

REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 9 35. The Vaccination Act was extended to the Municipality at Mônywa in March 1893 and to that at Ye-u in August 1893. 36. The question of extending the Act to the Cantonments of. Bhamo, Myingyan, Shwebo, and Meiktila, having been favourably reported on by the authorities concerned, the adoption of the scheme has been recommended to the Government of India. 37. The extension of the Vaccination Act to rural tracts and towns (other than Municipalties) in Lower Burma is under consideration. 38. My thank's are due to Dr. Sutherland, Health Officer, Rangoon, for the willing help rendered in cultivating and distributing bovine lymph and paste. D.

Extract from the Proceedings of the Chief Commissioner, Burma, in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON THE NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. There is no apparent reason why the difference in the work done by the vacci- nators of different districts should be so marked as in the above cases. The cost of the Vaccination Department was Rs. 36,841 or Rs. 3,451 more than in 1893-94, and the average cost of each successful case was 3 annas 7 pies as compared with 3 annas 9 pies in the previous year. The average cost was lowest in the Sando- way and Henzada districts, where it did not exceed 1½ annas and highest in the Akyab district, where it was over 7 annas. The Superintendent observes that although the Akyab total was less than half what it had been in 1893-94, it was still very high, and in this opinion the Chief Commissioner concurs. The high cost of vaccination at Akyab was due to expenditure incurred in connection with the maintenance of the calf depôt. The figures showing particulars of verifications performed are on the whole satisfactory. Outside Rangoon 31,760 cases are shown as having been inspected by Civil Surgeons and 30,704 by other inspecting officers. Statement No. V appended to the report is, however, not quite complete, and it is impossible to usefully compare the inspection work performed during the year of report as a whole with that performed in the previous year. It is clear, however, from what figures have been supplied that in the Arakan division generally the amount of verification done by Civil Surgeons is less than it ought to and might have been. The largest amount of verification was performed at Henzada by the Civil Surgeon, who inspected 4,342 cases. A number almost as large was verified in the Tharrawaddy district by the Civil Surgeon. The Municipalities of Kyauk- pyu, Myaungmya, Ramree, Zalun, and Kyangin were brought under the operation of the Vaccination Act during the year. Upper Burma. 2. The total number of persons vaccinated in Upper Burma was 114,863 as compared with 98,726 in 1893-94. This increase was shared by all the districts of Upper Burma save those of Mandalay, the Upper Chindwin, Pakôkku, Yamèthin, and Myingyan, and in none of these districts except Yamèthin was the decrease on the figures of the previous year very marked. At Yamèthin the diminution is said to be due not to inefficiency in the vaccination staff alone, but also to failure on the part of the people to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination. This neglect the Superintendent of Vaccination attributes to the freedom from small-pox enjoyed by this district during the year. It is a matter for regret that immunity from disease should tend to lower the importance of vaccination in the eyes of the rural population. It is the duty of the Civil Surgeon of each district to see that no pains are spared to show the people the folly of neglecting to take due precau- tions to protect themselves even when the necessity for those precautions is not obviously pressing. The diminution at Yamèthin and Myingyan had the result of reducing the total number of vaccinations for the Eastern division from 23,036 to 21,420. In the other three divisions the total number of vaccinations was higher than in the previous year. The largest increases on the figures for 1893-94 were apparent in the districts of Shwebo, Sagaing, and the Lower Chindwin. The percentages of success in the case of primary vaccinations rose during the year from 86.35 to 88.91 and in the case of secondary vaccinations from 44.73 to 45.59. Success was on the whole least marked in the more remote and in- accessible portions of the upper province, where for the most part communication is far from easy and difficulty is experienced in maintaining a constant supply of good lymph. A notable exception to this rule was, however, furnished by
RESOLUTION ON THE NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 3 the Upper Chindwin district, which labours under considerable disabilities in the above respect, and in which the percentage of success in primary vaccinations (93.82) was well above the provincial mean. It was in the Upper Chindwin dis- trict that the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was highest. The average for the whole province was 2,393. The two vaccinators employed during the year in the Upper Chindwin performed 3,837 vaccinations each. In the Myitkyina district the average was 425 only and in Mogaung 326. The same causes that brought about the low percentage of success at Myitkyina and Mogaung appear to have militated against a large outturn of work on the part of the vaccination staff in these two districts. The total expenditure on account of the Vaccination Department in Upper Burma was Rs. 16,781 as compared with Rs. 15,212 in 1893-94. Of this total Rs. 6,864 was paid from Municipal funds. The cost of the vaccination establishment rose from Rs. 11,792 to Rs. 13,046, but in other respects the expenditure of the year was practically the same as that of the previous year. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas 8 pies, or 3 pies less than in 1893-94 and 11 pies less than the average cost during the year in Lower Burma. Vaccination was performed more cheaply in the Shwebo district than in any other district of Upper Burma or indeed of the whole province. The cost of each successful case in the Northern Shan States (15 annas and 11 pies) was, the Chief Commissioner considers, unduly high. The return showing particulars of verification performed by inspecting officers in Up- per Burma compare favourably with that giving details of the work of verification in Lower Burma. At Shwebo, Ye-u, Sagaing, and Mônywa the Civil Surgeons did specially useful work in the matter of verifying vaccinations. The Vaccination Act was extended during the year to the Municipalities of Bhamo, Shwebo, Kyauksè, and Sagaing, and to the Cantonments of Bhamo, Myingyan, Shwebo, and Meiktila. The establishment of a vaccine depôt at Hsipaw in the Northern Shan States has had to be temporarily deferred ; the matter will, however, be re-opened during the current year. A proposal to appoint an itinerant medical officer to supervise the work of the vaccinators in the Southern Shan States is under consideration. By order of the Chief Commissioner, C. C. LOWIS, Officiating Secretary.
NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1894-95. LOWER BURMA. 1. Statement I.2 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 86.20 in the Arakan Hill Tracts, and 77.85 in Tavoy to 21.54 in Toungoo, 19.00 in Kyaukpyu, 17.27 in Pegu, 14.40 in Myaungmya, and 10.97 in Akyab. 10. Notwithstanding general progress, much room for improvement un- doubtedly exists in the five last-named districts. A recent increase of establish- ment has, however, taken place in the Akyab, Kyaukpyu, Pegu, Bassein, and Myaungmya districts, which will, it is expected, ensure an amount of protection equal at least to the birth-rate. 11. Statement II gives the cost of the establishments, the sources from which the expenditure is met, and the average cost of each successful operation. The expenditure was Rs. 3,451 in excess of that of the previous year. This is due to the revision and increase of several district establishments and the conse- quent larger amounts spent on pay and travelling allowances. 12. Of the total expenditure a percentage of 7 was borne by Provincial, 34 by Municipal, and 59 by local funds. 13. The average cost of each successful vaccination was 2 pies less than in 1893-94. The cost at Akyab still continued high (As. 7-1), but was less than half that of the previous year (As. 15-10). 14. Statement III.NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 3 18. In accordance with Government of India, Home Department letter No. 191, dated the 26th August 1892, the work done and the cost of vaccination in Municipal towns is given in the annexed table:4 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 19. There has been generally an improvement both in the percentage of successes and in the cost. The results were, however, poor at Ngathainggyaung (66.52), and to a lesser extent at Myaungmya (76.83) and Mergui (79.80). At Ngathainggyaung one vaccinator was dismissed for bad work and his successor fined for allowing his supply of lymph to run out. 20. Compared with the previous year the cost of each successful case re- mained the same at Henzada and fell at all the other towns except Akyab,. Sandoway, Bassein, Ngathainggyaung, Toungoo, Kyaikto, and Thayetmyo. At Bassein, Ngathainggyaung, and Toungoo this was due to the fall in the percent- age of successful cases ; at Sandoway and Kyaikto to the lesser number of opera- tions performed ; at Akyab to increased contingent charges (Rs. 180) in connec- tion with the maintenance of the calf depôt; and at Thayetmyo to the increase of the vaccinator's salary. 21.

The Vaccination Act was extended to the towns of Kyaukpyu, My- aungmya, Ramree, Zalun, and Kyangin during the year. UPPER BURMA. 24. The total number of persons vaccinated was 114,863, or 16,137 in excess of those of the previous year. Of these 110,943 were primary and 3,920 re-vaccinations. Most districts show an increase, but there has been a falling off in the numbers returned from Mandalay, Kindat, Pakôkku (including Gangaw), Yamèthin (including Pyinmana), and Myingyan. In Yamèthin alone has this been considerable (2,857 less). In the other districts the decrease ranged from 726 in Mandalay to 41 in Kindat. 25.

The Vaccination Act was extended during the year to the Municipalities at Bhamo, Shwebo, Kyauksè, and Sagaing and to the cantonments at Bhamo, Myingyan, Shwebo, and Meiktila. GENERAL REMARKS. 41. Several communications were received from Civil Surgeons complaining of the quality of lymph supplied by the Rangoon Vaccine Depôt, which has been less fortunate than usual in its selection of calves and in its lymph-manufacturing operations. In consequence greater recourse was made to the Mysore Vaccine Depôt, the supplies from which were almost invariably pronounced very satis- factory. 42. The sums available from flourishing District Cess Funds in Lower Burma have been utilized in augmenting the establishments of the following dis- tricts to the extent shown below:APPENDICES.

A.RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE Triennial period from 1893-942 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA proportion of the population protected. It should be remembered, however, that the increase shown in the proportion of protected persons is to some extent ficti- tious because the proportion is based year after year on the same population statis- tics, those of the census of 1891, and makes no allowance for the growth of popula- tion during the current decade. Simultaneous with the increase in primary vacci- nation the returns show a great decline in revaccinations, partly due, it appears, to the incorrect classification amongst revaccinations in past years of cases which were revaccinations only in the sense that the first operation was inefficient and had to be repeated. A falling off in revaccinations properly so called is no matter for regret. It is desired that vaccinators should, as far as possible, confine their energies to primary operations until they have overtaken the annual increase of the population by births, and this goal is still far ahead except in the large towns. The percentage of success in revaccinations in Upper Burma during the past year is remarkably high. The Chief Commissioner hesitates to accept the classification, especially in the Mandalay cases (641), of which over 90 per cent. are returned as successful. In primary cases the increased percentage of success- is satisfactory. It is, Mr. Smeaton trusts, an indication that men of a better stamp are being employed as vaccinators and that Civil Surgeons are devoting more care to the supply of active lymph. Success in vaccination work must always depend mainly on these considerations and they should be kept constantly in view. 3. In reviewing the triennial report for the period 1890-91 to 1892-93 the Government of India called attention to the large number of children left unpro- tected in rural tracts and to the discouraging results of the working of the department in Lower Burma generally. Steps were then taken for widening, the scope of the department in rural areas in Lower Burma, the increased expenditure being met in most cases from the District cess funds, assisted by subsidies from provincial funds in the case of districts, such as Sandoway, where the cess funds are small. The results of this action are summarized in the table printed above. The number of vaccinators in Lower Burma is now twice as great as in 1892-93 and there has been a nearly corresponding increase in the outturn of work. The Upper Burma staff also has been considerably increased, but it must be still further increased if the benefits of vaccination are to be, as they ought to be, widely diffused. But even in Lower Burma, though great strides have been made in recent years, the quantity of vaccination work still falls short of what is really necessary, especially among the infant population. During 1895 the number of births recorded in Lower Burma was 131,147. If from this figure the number of deaths of children under one year old (21,989) is deducted, there remained 1,09,158 infants available for vaccination, and this figure, it should be noted, is almost certainly below the truth, for it is admitted that many births escape registration. The report under review shows that (inclusive of dispensary vaccina- tions) only 41,107 children in their first year were successfully vaccinated during 1895-96. It appears therefore that only four children were protected out of every ten available for vaccination, or more accurately about 38 per cent., and this esti- mate as noted above takes no account of unregistered births, and moreover the aggregate number, 41,107, probably includes many infants left unvaccinated from the previous year. As might be expected, the deficiency in infant vaccination is for the most part confined to the villages. It is only in municipal towns and
FOR THE TRIENNIAL PERIOD FROM 1893-94-1895-96. 3 cantonments that vaccination is compulsory. The statement printed in para- graph 8 of the report shows that with a few exceptions vaccinations in muni- cipal towns in Lower Burma keep pace with the accessions to the population of the towns by births. A similar statement of much interest was furnished for rural tracts in the last triennial report, and such a statement might with advantage have been included in the present report. The Chief Commissioner will be glad if this statement (i.e., for districts exclusive of municipal towns) is given in future reports, and he requests also that statistics for the Upper Burma towns in which births and deaths are registered, and in which the Vaccination Act is in force, may be given in the statement for municipal towns. 4. Judged by the amount of work done by each vaccinator and the percent- age of successful cases, the districts in which vaccination work seems to have been pushed forward most vigorously during the year 1895-96 are Sandoway and Hanthawaddy (inclusive of Rangoon) in Lower, and Mandalay, Meiktila, Sagaing and the Chindwin districts in Upper, Burma. But the statement of inspections (Statement V) leaves room for doubt as to the quality of the work in Hantha- waddy. In the Toungoo, Salween, Mergui, Myingyan, Shwebo, and Katha dis- tricts the vaccinators appear to have been industrious but somewhat unsuccessful. The quality of the lymph-supply in these districts may be susceptible of improve- ment. The least satisfactory results were those attained by the Akyab, Kyauk- pyu, Bassein, and Myaungmya vaccinators in Lower Burma and in Myitkyina and the Ruby Mines districts in Upper Burma. Special local causes may account for the shortcomings in the quantity and quality of the work in Myitkyina and the Ruby Mines. If so, the causes should have been reported. But in the case of Akyab and Myaungmya, and also, though in a less degree, in the case of Bassein and Kyaukpyu, Mr. Smeaton can only suppose that the vaccinators are lazy and inefficient, and that the Civil Surgeons have been lacking in supervision. In Akyab the results are specially unsatisfactory, seeing that the district only lately (in 1893) recovered from a severe epidemic of small-pox. Verification of results. 5. In most districts the work of the vaccinators was fairly inspected during 1895-96, but in some the verification of operations was altogether inadequate. In this respect the re- turns for the districts of the Arakan division are the worst. The Civil Surgeons of these districts must devote much more attention to vaccination work in future. The Native Superintendent in Akyab district inspected only 1.51 per cent. of the vaccination cases. The Superintendent is requested to submit a special report on this officer's work. In the Hanthawaddy district the great bulk of the inspection work was done by the Native Superintendents: they reported 82.17 per cent. of the cases inspected by them to be successful, a proportion very slightly less than that claimed by the vaccinators themselves. But in the cases inspected by the Civil Surgeon (only 6.41 per cent. of the aggregate number) the percentage of success- ful instances was found to be only 34.99. This wide discrepancy casts grave doubts on the accuracy of the Native Superintendents' returns and shows the need of better supervision on the part of the Civil Surgeon. The Civil Surgeon's duties at headquarters have been lightened by the appointment of a Resident Medical Officer to the Rangoon General Hospital. He should in future be able to devote more time to checking vaccination work in Hanthawaddy, especially in the
4 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA environs of Rangoon. Inspections were insufficient also in the Prome and Henzada districts, especially in the former, where the vaccinators' returns of successful cases appear to have been excessive. The Civil Surgeons of these districts have other onerous duties at headquarters and can pay only flying visits to the interior. If the District cess funds can afford it, Native Superinten- dents should be appointed, but the experience of Hanthawaddy shows that great care is necessary in the selection of these men. In the case of the Rangoon Municipality explanation should have been offered of the similarity of the figures in the last three columns of Statement V. A special paragraph should be devoted in future reports to vaccination in Rangoon. The Civil Surgeons who did the best work in superintending vaccination in Lower Burma were Surgeon-Major Rundle at Thayetmyo, Surgeon-Captain Kanta Prasad at Pegu, Assistant Surgeon Robert Tharrawaddy, Assistant Surgeon Omerto Lal Munshi at Ma-ubin, and Mr. Maddox at Mergui. Inspection work was on the whole much better in Upper than in Lower Burma. The amount of work and the results were specially satisfactory in Sagaing, the Lower Chindwin, and Minbu, where the Civil Surgeons (Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colo- nel Mukerji, Assistant Surgeon Nolan, and Surgeon-Captain Dewes) appear to have devoted much time and attention to this important branch of their duties. Dispensary vaccination. 6. The number of vaccinations performed at dispensaries (other than dis- pensaries which have been appointed vaccine-stations under the Act) increased considerably in both Upper and Lower Burma during each of the past three years. The amount of vaccination work done in Upper Burma dispensaries was more than double the amount done in Lower Burma dispensaries, the reason being apparently that a larger proportion of the Lower Burma dispensaries have been appointed vaccine-stations. The aggre- gate number of successful dispensary cases in 1895-96 for the whole province was only 6,060. Mr. Smeaton thinks that dispensaries, outside of municipal limits might well do more than this. The returns show that in several districts the Hospital Assistants in medical charge of outstations did no vaccination work at all. The percentage of successful primary cases is satisfactorily highFOR THE TRIENNIAL PERIOD FROM 1893-946 RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Progress of vaccination and pre- valence of small-pox. 10. The Superintendent's report furnishes no precise information as to the general effect of vaccination in reducing the mor- tality from small-pox. The diagrams printed in para- graphs 9 and 24 are of little value for this purpose. It is observed that the order of the districts is merely reproduced from the dia- gram in the previous year's report. It is not likely that any convincing evidence of the efficacy of vaccination in the districts will be forthcoming until the operations embrace a much larger proportion than at present of the whole population. During the past ten years the mortality from small-pox in Lower Burma varied from 115 in 1886 to 3,693 in 1890, and the variations had no traceable relation to the variations in the amount of vaccination work performed during the same period. In 1895 the number of deaths was 1,540 or .34 per mille, the majority of the deaths in this as in previous years occurring among children under 12 years old. But, though it is difficult to apply a conclusive test as to the value of vacci- nation in the rural tracts of Burma, there is some indication that in the towns the degree of protection ensured by the enforcement of the Act is higher than in the rural tracts. Of the aggregate number of deaths (1,540) in 1895 only 102 occur- red in towns, and the death-rate from this cause in towns was only .18 per mille as compared with .36 per mille in the rural tracts. In 1894 the corresponding death-rates were .30 per mille in the towns and .40 per mille outside, and in 1893 .63 and .69 per mille respectively. The real divergency is perhaps more striking than would appear from these figures, since fewer deaths escape registration in the towns than in the villages. 11. The report contains no remarks on the attitude of the people towards vaccination. But in the Sanitary Report for 1895 it is stated that in the districts of the Irrawaddy division, where small-pox has been more or less prevalent for the past three years, &quot; inoculators are largely at work and the opposition to &quot; vaccination, except in the Karen villages, is very pronounced.&quot; The last trien- nial report on vaccination described the popular attitude as '' generally anta- gonistic &quot; to vaccination and the work of the vaccinators as &quot; a hopeless struggle against ignorance and prejudice.&quot; In these views Mr. Smeaton is not disposed to concur. During his recent visit to Minbu he found that a trained vaccinator had set up private practice in a sickly tract in the interior and was earning a livelihood. In the towns at least it is clear that there is no general hostility to vaccination, seeing that nearly all the municipalities have from time to time voluntarily applied for the extension of the Vaccination Act. The benefits of vaccination are less appreciated in rural tracts because its efficacy is not so well understood, and the efforts to promote this understanding are not so strenuous or persistent as in the towns. Inoculation as a rule flourishes only where vacci- nation work has been slack and apathetic. The large increase in the number of operations performed is in itself a sign that the popular distrust, such as it is, is being gradually overcome. 12. The Chief Commissioner desires to call the attention of Civil Surgeons to one further reason which in some districts may prevent the inhabitants of vil- lages from taking to vaccination so kindly as the townspeople. In towns the vaccinator himself or, failing him, the medical officer of the civil dispensary is near at hand to furnish advice and medicine in case the vaccinated arm should be-

Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON THE NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. Superintendent) could be made available for both town and district and another vaccinator could be entertained. A competent man should be able to deal with the operations in the town during the occasional respites from his tours in the district which must occur. The Lieutenant-Governor desires the Deputy Com- missioner and Civil Surgeon to consult the Municipal Committee and report at an early date. The proportion of success in primary cases was unduly low in Hanthawaddy, where the mortality from small-pox was the highest in the prov- ince. It should be explained whether this was due to the inferior quality of the lymph. A large number of the small-pox cases in the Hanthawaddy district are doubtless traceable to Rangoon Town, and the enforcement of stricter measures in the city will lead to an improvement in the surrounding district. The death- rate from small-pox in .Henzada was again very high. Nine vaccinators were employed in this district, and the number of persons operated on by each vacci- nator (2,802), though slightly above the provincial average, is not as high as it should be in a district which is densely populated and in which communications are fairly good. The percentage of cases verified by the Civil Surgeon was inadequate. The district cess fund can afford to devote a larger portion of its funds to this important object and, if the establishment is insufficient, proposals should be made for increasing it. Vaccination is also backward in Myaungmya. The number of operations (6,461) by a staff of five vaccinators and the percentage of successful cases are both unduly small. There was a general improvement both in the number and the efficacy of dispensary vaccinations, but the low average of success in Hanthawaddy, Myaungmya, and Thayetmyo should be explained. In Pegu and Mergui the inspection work of the Civil Surgeons was satisfactory, but in most cases too little attention seems to have been paid to the supervision of the work of vaccinators. In Tavoy and Tharrawaddy particularly the neglect of this duty was without excuse and throws suspicion upon the high percentage of suc- cessful primary vaccinations returned for the latter district. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of a close supervision of vaccination by Civil Sur- geons, and the Lieutenant-Governor trusts there will be no further occasion to draw attention to this omission. The average cost of each successful case was Annas 2-11. The average cost at Akyab was too high and will be reduced in proportion as the efficiency of the vaccinators is increased. Upper Burma. 3. In Upper Burma there was an increase in the number of vaccinations of10,761 as compared with the previous year. Of the total number of operations performed 123,520 were primary vaccinations, among which the percentage of success was 93.34, the corresponding figures for 1895-96 being 113,778 and 92.67 respectively. Of the 2,944 re-vaccinations 1,903 were successful, being an increase of 1,019 cases and 620 successes over the returns for the previous year. The proportion of success, however, in secondary operations fell from 66.65 to 64.64. The increase in the number of operations in Pakokku district was very marked ; but, though the percentage of successful cases was only 93.11, there do not appear to have been any re-vaccinations. This should be explained. In Pakôkku, Meiktila, and Shwebo each vaccinator is reported to have performed over 4,000 operations, a satisfactory outturn of work, if properly supervised and checked. The
RESOLUTION ON THE NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 3 decrease in the number of vaccinations carried out in the Minbu and Bhamo districts is accounted for in the report, but if the explanation of the falling off in Katha is correct, there is room for improvement, as the returns for the previous year were not abnormally high. As pointed out by the Superintendent, the per- centage of cases in which primary and secondary vaccinations in Katha were effective requires further explanation. The desirability of checking the ravages of small-pox in the Shan States has occupied the attention of Government and of the local authorities. The method adopted in the Southern States of instructing the sayas or native doctors in vaccination was abandoned at the end of 1896 owing to the impossibility of checking their work. A similar experiment was proposed to' be tried in the Northern States, but was not adopted, because as a general rule these men are lazy and untrustworthy. It was also proposed to start a vaccine depôt at Lashio or Hsipaw, but as the wants of the province are supplied from Taunggyi, Rangoon, and Bangalore and as Lashio offers no special facilities the proposal was not adopted. The entertainment of additional travelling vacci- nators in the Southern States was sanctioned at the end of 1896, and better results may be expected in the current year. The returns of vaccinations in the Northern Shan States for 1896-97 show that some increase of establishment is required, but the greatest obstacle to progress in these tracts is the difficulty of proper supervision as the Civil Surgeon has not the time to travel many miles to check a few cases, and a suitable officer to act as Inspector is not available. The absence of figures as to re-vaccinations in Pakôkku has been referred to above. Similar omissions occur in the returns for the Ruby Mines, Myitkyina, Kyauksè, and Upper Chindwin districts and should be explained. There was a slight reduction in the average cost of each successful case. The falling off in the number and success of dispensary vaccinations is un- satisfactory, and the return (Statement III) is apparently incomplete. Civil Sur- geons in Upper Burma are, as a rule, less tied to their headquarters than in Lower Burma and inspections by them should therefore be much more numerous. The Civil Surgeons at Minbu, Kindat, Shwebo, Magwe, Katha, and Mogaung were wanting in energy. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, F. C. GATES, Secretary.
NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1896-97. A DETAILED triennial report on vaccination having been submitted last year, it is only necessary now to give a few notes in explanation of the figures in the accompanying tables. The population in the statements is that of the cen- sus of 1891. 2. The delay in the submission of the report has been due mainly to the very late receipt of the report and returns from the Health Officer, Rangoon, and of the statements from the Comptroller showing the cost of the department, neither of which were received in this office till the end of May.

The number of operations on infants and on children under six years of age is respectively 22,753 and 16,198 in excess of that of the preceding year, which is so far satisfactory. But, taking the birth-rate at only 30 per mille so as to exclude such as die in early infancy, and the population at 4,252,030 by doubl- ing the number of females within the area under registration in Lower Burma to get rid of sex disparity, there would be roughly 127,561 births, whereas the total number of successful primary vaccinations under one year even yet only amounts to 63,484. 9. The percentages of success in primary and secondary operations were 92.01 and 58.79 respectively as against 91.21 and 46.01 in 1895-96. 10. A considerable increase is also noticeable in the average number of cases vaccinated by each vaccinator, which was 2,622 against 1,974 in the previous year. The average was highest in Sandoway, Rangoon, Amherst, and Hanthawaddy districts, where it amounted to 5,894, 5,162, 4,558, and 4,239 respectively. In other districts it varied from 3,520 in Thatôn, 3,094 in Mergui, 2,802 in Henzada, 2,686 in Tavoy, 2,597 in Pegu, to 1,471, 1,363, 1,310, and 1,292 in Akyab, Northern Arakan, Kyaukpyu, and Myaungmya respectively. 11. With the exception of Akyab the number of successful operations per- formed in each district exceeded the mean of the previous three years and the ratio of persons protected per 1,000 of population during the year varied from 215 in Sandoway, 103 in Tavoy, 101 in Rangoon, 87 in Thatôn, 86 in Northern Arakan, and 75 in Mergui to 25 in Myaungmya and 15 in Akyab. The improve- ment in protection is more or less general, with the exception of the two last named districts, which are backward and require special attention on the part of the Superintendents of Vaccination. 12. In the diagram annexed is shown the proportion of the population pro- tected during the seven years ending with March 1897 and the death-rate from small-pox for the calendar year 1896. 13. In a country like Burma where the registration of vital statistics is admittedly very faulty, and into which large numbers of unprotected immigrants constantly enter, it is difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy the precise influence exercised by vaccination over the mortality from small-pox. From the subjoined table, in which is shown by quinquennial periods the death- rate from small-pox since 1881, it would appear that the fatality from this cause is on the decline. The fluctuations from year to year are somewhat pronounced however and suggest that the repressive agency is far from complete in its application. Official year.

With the exception of Sandoway, Toungoo, Ngathainggyaung, and Tavoy, where protection by vaccination was not equal to the accession to population by births, all the other towns show a considerable excess of operations over births during the year. This is explained by the fact that large numbers of children outside municipal limits are brought in for vaccination. Moreover, the town vaccinators do not confine themselves in many places within municipal limits, but operate within a radius of 5 miles of the town. 20.

6 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. Generally there has been improvement in the percentage of successes with decline in the cost. The results were poor in Ngathainggyaung, where the per- centage of success fell from 100 in the last year to 90.38 in the year under report. Compared with the preceding year, the cost of each successful case was less in all but the following towns,NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97 7 District exclusive of Municipal town.

8 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. All districts show improvement in the percentages of success and a decline in the average cost of each successful case, except Hanthawaddy, Thôngwa, and Toungoo where the percentage of success fell from 97.62, 93.68, and 86.47 in 1895-96 to 75.36, 93.35 and 86.47 in the year of report. In Akyab, Hanthawaddy, Prome, and Tavoy the cost of each successful case was slightly higher than that of the previous year. 23.

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 9 (4) The appearence of a private vaccinator in the district who vaccinat- ed over 1,400 persons in Ngapè township. The decrease in Bhamo district was due to the illness of one vaccinator, who could do no work for six months, and to the limited number of children available for vaccination, as well as to the remoteness of some places where, in the words of the Superintendent of Vaccination, &quot; cases are few and far between and the cost &quot; of transport prohibitive.&quot; The decrease of 1,006 cases in Katha has been explained by Mr. Martin, the present Civil Surgeon, as being only apparent and not real as he believes the re- turns for the previous year to be open to doubt. The falling off in the number of operations in Northern Shan States is due to the great objection of the Shans to vaccination. In the case of the Lower Chindwin the falling off is confined solely to the town and has been attributed to the paucity of available subjects. 27. Among the districts which show an increase, Pakôkku, Shwebo, Myin- gyan, and Meiktila, with an excess of 7,286, 3,719, 1,273, and 818 operations, are the chief. The increase in other districts varies from 286 in Ruby Mines, 235 in Myitkyina, 207 in Southern Shan States to 122 in the Upper Chindwin district and 74 in Sagaing. 28. The percentages of success in primary cases and in re-vaccinations were 93.34 and 64.64 respectively as against 92.67 and 66.65 in 1895-96. In Katha the percentage of success in primary operations (75) is very low ; in fact it is much lower than in re-vaccinations (84). The Superintendent of Vaccin- ation has not explained this anomaly. He merely remarks that the small percent- age of success is due to bad lymph, but it is not understood why the same lymph produced better results in the case of re-vaccinations. 29. In Magwe out of 137 re-vaccinations 136 proved successful, giving a percentage of 99.27, a result which would be open to doubt but for the assurances of the Civil Surgeon, who himself verified every case. 30. A considerable increase is discernible in the average number of cases vaccinated by each vaccinator, which is 2,480 as against 2,143 in 1895-96. The average was highest in Pakôkku, Shwebo, and Meiktila. In other dis- tricts it varied from 3,696 in Upper Chindwin, 2,958 in Sagaing, 2,701 in the Lower Chindwin, 2,621, in Myingyan to 739 in Northern Shan States and 686 in Myit- kyina. 31. On the whole the work in the Upper Province has considerably im- proved, though much remains still to be done, as in the majority of districts the protection by vaccination falls far short of the probable mean annual birth-rate. 32. The extent to which the population of each district is protected is shown in the diagram annexed. The death-rate from small-pox cannot be shown therein as vital statistics are not registered in Upper Burma except in a few Municipal towns. 33. Statement II.10 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. The cost of the department exceeded that of the previous year by Rs. 519. The increase is due to the opening of a vaccine depôt at Taunggyi in the South- ern Shan States and to travelling allowances. 34. The percentage of the total cost borne by Government was 61 and by Municipalities 39 as compared with 60 and 40 in 1895-96. 35. The Provincial average cost of each successful case was Annas 2-4, or 2 pies less than in the year previous, and, as in that year, the cost was high- est in the Myitkyina district, though reduced by Annas 3-2. The Northern Shan States continues to occupy the second place; the Pakôkku district returns the lowest average cost (Annas 1-0); and in the Upper Chindwin (Annas 1-2) and Shwebo (Annas 1-3) districts the average cost is much the same as in 1895- 96. 36.

Vaccination by native sayas in the Southern Shan States having prov- ed a failure, was stopped by order of the local Government and two extra Govern- ment vaccinators were sanctioned to visit the headquarters of the various States with a view to popularize vaccination. 43. Lymph paste was partly obtained from Bangalore and partly manu- factured in the local depôts; the latter seem to have made good progress during the year. The paste made in Rangoon and Taunggyi was on the whole very satisfactory. RANGOON : D. SINCLAIR, M.B., Surgeon-Colonel, Superintendent-General of Vaccination, Burma. The 19th June 1897.

In that case a part of his salary might be contributed from Provincial funds. The Superintendent of Vaccination is re- quested to make special enquiry regarding the Sandoway statistics. If the returns are correct, it will be useful to learn how the Sandoway vaccinators contrive to vaccinate on the average 7,000 persons in the year, the provincial average being only about 2,500. 3. The staff of vaccinators in the Shan States was the same as in the pre- vious year. In the Northern States there was a satisfactory increase in the number of vaccinations, but the percentage of success continued to be very low and the amount of checking was insufficient. An addition of two vaccinators has lately been sanctioned for the Northern States. It is hoped that the Civil Surgeon will be able to test a larger proportion of the work than in the past. The large proportion of failures deserves the attention of the Superintendent of Vaccination. It should be ascertained whether the lymph is properly kept at Lashio. Vaccination work in the Southern States fell off owing to an out- break of cholera. 4. The least satisfactory returns are those relating to the town of Rangoon. The chief statistics of the past three years are as follows:RESOLUTION ON THE NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION' IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 3 5. The total cost of vaccination was Rs. 66,790 as against Rs. 64,153 in 1896-97. The percentage borne by Municipal funds remained about the same, but that borne by Provincial funds rose from 18.23 to 21.75, while in the case of Local funds there was a corresponding proportionate decrease. The increased expendi- ture from Provincial funds occurred chiefly in Upper Burma. The average cost of each successful case was 2 annas and 9 pies, the same as in 1896-97. Of individual districts, the cost was unduly high in Akyab and was lowest in Sando- way, where the average cost of each successful case is returned as only 11 pies. In the towns both Rangoon and Mandalay show a charge of over 7 annas per case and the lowest figure is that of Sagaing, 1 anna and 1 pie. 6. His Honour considers that the District cess funds of the populous deltaic districts might with advantage employ more vaccinators. Vaccination work in these districts is at present inadequate and the vital statistics of 1897 show that the mortality from small-pox was greatest in districts near the capital. Of 1,950 deaths registered in Lower Burma during the year 1,243 occurred in Rangoon, Hanthawaddy, Pegu, Tharrawaddy, and Thôngwa. From the Sanitary Report it does not appear that the dissemination of the disease was traced in any of these districts to the migratory Madras coolie class. The practice of inoculation is said to have in many cases led to outbreaks of small-pox, and the surest way of combating this practice is to bring vaccination to the doors of all. 7. In Lower Burma the number of dispensary vaccinations was considera- ble only in the Hanthawaddy and Thongwa districts, and the operations perform- ed at the dispensaries of these districts were mostly cases of re-vaccination. In Upper Burma a large amount of successful primary vaccination work was done at the Sagaing dispensaries. 8. At Shwebo and Kindat the number of cases verified by the Civil Sur- geons was again inadequate, and the Civil Surgeons of Pegu, Thayetmyo, and Kyaukpyu also did too little inspection work. The Civil Surgeons of Sagaing and Mônywa appear to have been most energetic in this respect. The Lieuten- ant-Governor would be glad to receive some explanation of the wide divergence between the percentage of successful cases found by the Civil Surgeon and the percentage as reported by the vaccinators in the Hanthawaddy district. This divergence has for the past three years been greater in Hanthawaddy than in any other district. 9. The Vaccination Act, 1880, was extended to Thônzè and is now in force in all the Municipalities of the Province. The Pagan and Letpadan Munici- pal Committees during the year framed rules for the enforcement of the Act. Proposals are under consideration for amending the law so as to make the Act applicable to small towns administered by Town Committees. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, D. H. R. TWOMEY, Officiating Secretary.
NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1897-98. As desired by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor in his resolution on the Vaccination Report for 1896-97, the two parts of the province have been treated together in this report and the statements concerning them have been amalgamated. 2.

The following table shows the number of successful vaccinations, the number of births, and the number of survivals in municipal towns for the year:NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 5 With the exception of Rangoon, Ngathainggyaung, Akyab, and Kyaukpyu, where the number of successful vaccinations was not equal to the number of sur- vivals, all towns show a considerable excess of operations over births. This excess is due, as explained last year, to the fact that large numbers of children whose homes are outside municipal limits are brought in for vaccination. 16.

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 9 The majority of the districts show an increase in the percentage of success and a decrease in the average cost of each successful case. Akyab and Southern Shan States are responsible for a large increase in the average cost per head which rose from 4 annas and 2 pies in 1896-97 to 6 annas and 5 pies in the year of report in the former, and from 3 annas to 6 annas and 11 pies in the latter. 19.

Comparative results by districts. 5. The districts of Henzada and Prome employed the largest number of vacci- nators during the period under review. In Henzada, excluding the municipal town, the total number of persons vaccinated per annum rose from an average of 7,381 in the previous triennium to an average of 22,131 in the last three years. The actual number vacci- nated during 1898-99 was 29,291. In Thayetmyo the yearly average has increased from 6,805 to 15,568, in Sandoway from 11,153 to 19,506 in Thôngwa from 6,870 to 13,434, and in Pegu from 5,476 to 11,527. In Henzada and Thôngwa this large increase has been accompanied by a marked improvement in the ratio of successful primary cases. In Lower Burma the average number of operations performed by each vac- cinator was highest in Sandoway district (8,572), the second place being taken by Amherst (4,956). The success of the Sandoway vaccinators is said to be due to the favourable attitude of the people towards vaccination. An outbreak of small-pox in the Central township was followed by wholesale vaccination of the inhabitants of the rural tracts. The district officials too are reported to take great interest in the work. His Honour is, however, inclined to distrust the figures for this district. In the tables printed in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report the per- centage of successful vaccinations on children under one year of age is shown as 134.15 in the municipal town and 113.93 in the district outside the town. Though, as has been shown above, the former figure may be capable of explanation, the latter can scarcely be correct, except on the hypothesis that a very large number of births escape registration. The figures should be tested by a comparison of the vaccinators' returns with the birth registers. The amount of work done by each vaccinator was lowest in the Arakan Hill Tracts (1,331), Akyab (1,428), and Myaungmya (1,528). The backwardness of vaccination in the two latter districts has been the subject of unfavourable comment in each annual report. The Lieute- nant-Governor trusts that the Deputy Superintendents will endeavour to remove this stigma from their districts. In Upper Burma the outturn of work was highest in Shwebo (4,682), where, however, it has steadily decreased during the period under review, and lowest in Myitkyina (863) and in the Shan States. The average percentage of successful primary operations outside municipal towns was highest, in Lower Burma, in Bassein (98.05), and lowest in Hanthawaddy (87.85). In Upper Burma it was highest in Minbu (97.5), and lowest in the Northern Shan States (80.76) and Myitkyina (81.1). Dispensary vaccination. 6. As in the preceding triennium, so in that under review, there has been asteady increase in the number of dispensary vacci- nations, which in 1895-96 totalled 7,195 and in 1898-99 14,349. In the latter year, however, there was an abnormal rise in the numbers who submitted themselves to vaccination, due no doubt to the small-pox scare which prevailed during the last few months of that period. Vaccination in the Shan States. 7. The statistics for the Southern Shan States reveal a moderate degree ofprogress. The total number of vaccinations per- formed has risen from an average of 2,913 in the preceding period to 3,561 during the past three years, and the average of opera- tions performed by each vaccinator has increased from 1,456 to 1,780 in 1898-99.
4 RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1896-97-1898-99. The ratio of success is still low ; with a vaccine establishment near at hand, the results are unsatisfactory. The figures for the Northern Shan States are more encouraging. The average annual number of vaccinations for the preceding period was only 586; in 1898-99 it was 2,975. The ratio of success, though low, has risen considerably, and the average outturn of work of the vaccinators is nearly double what it was in the previous period. Vaccination in Rangoon. 8. The returns for the Rangoon Municipality are far from satisfactory. Theonly improvement has been in the percentage of successful cases, and these figures the Superintend- ent-General regards as untrustworthy. Though the establishment has remained the same, there has been a decrease in the number of vaccinations from 35,401 in 1895-96 to 11,832 in 1898-99. The illegal practice of forcibly compelling coolies to be vaccinated was put a stop to in August 1896; this may account to a certain extent for the decrease, but not altogether. A very large number of children have escaped vaccination, and the percentage of protection is consequently low. Considering the strength of the establishment at the Municipal Health Officer's disposal and the facilities he enjoys for putting the Act into force, the results for the past three years appear to His Honour to be disappointing. Verification of results. 9. There has been an improvement during the past three years in LowerBurma in the percentage of cases inspected by Civil Surgeons to the total number of persons vaccinated. During the previous triennium the percentage averaged 14.79 and in the period under review 17.14. In Upper Burma the figures are respectively 33.31 and 32.54. Inspection is still less thorough in Lower Burma than in Upper Burma. The decrease in the work of the Native Superintendents is an unsatisfactory feature of the report. District Superintendents are requested to see that there is no further cause of complaint against these men. Financial. 10. The total cost of the Vaccination Department has risen from Rs. 59,511in 1893-94 to Rs. 69,675 in 1898-99. The average annual cost for the preceding three years was Rs. 53,912, while that for the triennium under review was Rs. 66,873. The average cost of each operation has considerably declined, as the following table will show:RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1896-97-1898-99. 5 the population, the attitude of the people towards vaccination, and the cost and difficulty of travelling. But the conditions in municipal towns vary but little, and His Honour is not satisfied that the high cost of vaccination in some munici- palities could not be reduced. Local Funds continue to bear about one-half the total cost of vaccination, Government and Municipal Funds sharing the balance in the proportion of 21 per cent. and 29 per cent. respectively. The ratio of expenditure borne by Local and Municipal Funds has, however, shown a steady decrease during the past three years, while that borne by Government has, owing to the establishment of a vaccine depôt at Taunggyi in the Southern Shan States, shown a corresponding increase. Progress of vaccination and pre- valence of small-pox. 11. Beyond tabulating some statistics in the body of his report, the Super- intendent-General gives no assistance in arriving at conclusions as to the effect of vaccination in afford- ing security against small-pox. The number of per- sons protected in Lower Burma is much higher than fifteen years ago, while the mortality from small-pox is somewhat less heavy. These figures by themselves scarcely justify the assumption of any relation of cause and effect. On the other hand, in the towns of Lower Burma, which are comparatively well protected, the death-rate from the disease continues to be below that which prevails in rural tracts, the rate per mille of population in 1898 being .85 and 1.10 respectively. It appears also on the whole that those districts which are best protected suffer least from the ravages of the disease. As remarked in a former review, the area of operations is not yet sufficiently wide to make it an easy matter to demon- strate by statistics the undoubted value of vaccination. Year by year as the field is extended this difficulty will doubtless disappear. Vaccination of coolies. 12. The question of amending the Vaccination Act with the special objectof providing for the compulsory vaccination of cooly immigrants from Madras has been under discussion for some time, but a final decision has not yet been arrived at. Opinions are not unanimous on the subject, and it is well that it should be thoroughly considered from all points of view before action is taken. General remarks. 13. The report is marred to some extent by the inclusion of too manytables and statements. For the sake of convenience of comparison and intelligibility, it is desirable that comment and inferences should be based as far as possible on the prescribed state- ments attached to the report. Attention is invited to the orders on this matter contained in paragraph 2 of the Chief Commissioner's Resolution No. 561 dated the 27th January 1888. The question of the extent to which the practice of inoculation is carried on is of interest and might have been mentioned. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor, J. B. WINGATE, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Burma.

In Meiktila and the Southern Shan States the additions to establishment were accountable for the excess in expenditure under this head, while in Prome and Upper Chindwin the expenditure increased under Pay and travelling allowances. The average cost for each successful case in 1896-97 varied from As. 10-6 in Myitkyina, As. 7-5 in the Northern Shan States, As. 6-11 in Akyab, and As. 6-8 in Bhamo, to As. 1-4 each in Mandalay and Myingyan, As. 1-3 in Shwebo, As. 1-2 each in Upper and Lower Chindwin, and 10 pies in Pakôkku. In 1897-98 the cost per case ranged from As. 8-11 in Myitkyina, As. 6-11 in the Southern Shan States, As. 6-5 in Akyab, and As. 6-1 in the Northern Shan States, to As. 1-5 each in Mandalay and Upper Chindwin, As. 1-3 each in Lower Chindwin and Myingyan, As. 1-1 in Shwebo, and 11 pies in Sandoway ; while in 1898-99 the range was from As. 7-3 in the Southern Shan States, As. 6-5 in Myitkyina, As. 5-10 in Akyab, and As. 5-7 in the Arakan Hill Tracts to As. 1-5 in Chindwin (both Upper and Lower), As. 1-3 each in Tavoy and Myingyan, As. 1-2 in Shwebo, and 10 pies in Sandoway. 21. The subjoined abstract contrasts the vaccination work done in dispen- saries in Burma:16 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1896-97TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1896-97-1898-99. 17 rapidly and steadily declined. Excepting 1898-99, the decrease has been equally marked both under primary operations and re-vaccinations throughout the period dealt with in the table. This extraordinary falling off in the outturn of work from year to year has been explained by the Health Officer to be for the most part only apparent and not real as the accuracy of the figures of 1896-97 and the previous years is, in his opinion, open to grave doubt. In part, however, the deficiency is attributable to the compulsory vaccination of adults being put a stop to. The de- crease in 1898-99 is exclusively owing to the fact that the vaccination operations on convicts in the Central Prison, Rangoon, which hitherto used to be added to municipal returns, have during that year been credited to dispensary vaccinations in the Rangoon Town district. Notwithstanding the large and continuous decrease in the quantity, the qua- lity of the work has steadily improved. In primary cases the ratio per cent. of successful operations has risen from 85.95 per cent. in 1895-96 to 96.91 per cent. in 1898-99, whilst in the case of re-vaccinations the increase during the same period has been from 45.35 to 80.42 per cent. Considering the large number of operations performed the rate of success in re-vaccinations would seem to be exceptionally high. The Health Officer attributes it to the improved quality of glycerinated lymph paste prepared by him, but, even making due allowance for the alleged potency of the lymph, I am unable to accept the explanation as thoroughly satisfactory and am rather inclined to think that the exaggeration in part at least was due to wrong classification. 25. The average cost of each successful case shows a progressive rise from As. 3-4 in 1895-96 to As. 8-6 in the last year of the triennium. The explana- tion of the large increase in the average cost lies no doubt in the very marked de- crease in the outturn of the work done. For the same reason the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator fell from 7,080 in 1895-96 to 2,366 in 1898-99. 26.
