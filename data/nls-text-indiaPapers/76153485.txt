ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE (including the Reports of the Epizootic Diseases Department in Calcutta and its Vicinity and of the Raymond Research Laboratory) FOR THE YEAR 1910-11. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. I HELD charge of the Bengal Veterinary College, the Epizootic Diseases Department in Calcutta and its neighbourhood and the Raymond Research Laboratory. I was senior officer of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, throughout the year. Mr. P. J. Kerr, i.c.v.d., joined for training on 22nd January, when he arrived in Calcutta from England. The chief item of interest in this report is the peaceful extension of the work which is due to the trust the people have in the Department; a much less cheering subject is the non-allotment of money for developing the College at Belgachia.

At the request of the Health Officer of the Corporation of Calcutta, 70 calves were examined and tested at the Animal Vaccine Depot, Ballygunge, in order to ascertain their fitness for the preparation of vaccine lymph. 8. During the year Rabies appeared in epizootic form in Calcutta: 103 dogs and 39 carcasses, mostly from Calcutta, were sent to Belgachia for examination, of which 77 proved to be suffering from Rabies. 9. While the Remount Dep6t at Garden Reach was closed from April to October, 1,672 horses, 18 cattle and 9 dogs were inspected by the Glanders staff on board the ships at the port of Calcutta. No clinical symptoms of any infectious disease were observed. THE RAYMOND RESEARCH LABORATORY.

PREFACE AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. 1. I held charge of the department throughout the year under report. I was on tour for 217 days and travelled 1,101 miles by road and 21,340 miles by rail. 2. During the rains the work of the Assistants of the Orissa and Burdwan Divisions were inspected as well as the dispensaries at Larpur, Chapra, Sewan, Dumraon, Arrah, Bankipore, Daltongunge, Gaya, Muzaflarpur, Bettiah, Moti- hari, Siliguri, Ghoom, Kalimpong and Jessore. 3. The farms at Siripur, Bettiah and Kalimpong were visited ; and outbreaks of glanders at Uttarpara, Hooghly and Jessore and one of surra in Gaya as well as rinderpest at Howrah and Sambalpur were attended and necessary measures taken for the eradication of the diseases. 4. I inspected the cattle fairs and shows at Kalimpong, Sonepur and Singheswar; and enquiries were made into an outbreak of disease at Siripur Farm which caused the sudden death of three cattle in the desi herd. 5. At the request of the Director of Agriculture the cattle at the Agri- cultural College, Sabour, were inspected and advice was given to prevent the spread of contagious diseases to the Montgomery herd. I attended meetings of the Provincial and Divisional Agricultural and Bihar Planters' Associa- tions. PART I.( 2 ) accurate. During a tour in Bihar it was brought to my notice long after the disease had subsided that a severe outbreak, resembling Black quarter, had occurred in the south of Champaran and in Muzaffarpur, but the figures for these districts do not show that a severe epidemic had broken out and was responsible for high mortality. Though an improvement has been noticed in some districts in regard to the manner in which diseases are reported, much still remains to be done before it can be called satisfactory. 11. The Inspector-General of Police has been good enough to allow a register of diseases to be kept in each thana. It is now one of the recognized police forms. 12. The notice of district officials and members of the Planters' and Agricultural Associations has been drawn frequently to the necessity of report- ing outbreaks, but very little attention has been given to the subject. I regret to have to call attention again to the fact that members of the Agricultural Associations take so little interest in reporting disease. The reason for this state of affairs appears to be that the membership in most instances is composed of pleaders or other persons whose duties rarely take them outside the civil stations. EQUINE. 13. Glanders.( 3 ) most districts of the province. The number of outbreaks reported to the veterinary assistants in which inoculations were performed amounted to 282 against 141 of the previous year. 20. Foot and mouth disease.( 4 ) the interior periodically or whenever outbreaks of disease require them to do so. They visited 13,737 villages and treated 45,187 patients against 13,047 villages and 49,884 patients, respectively, of the previous year. This is a very large decrease but is due to the fact that the work of some of the assistants was so unsatisfactory that they had to be dismissed or were asked to resign. The posts at Alipore, Baraset, Howrah, Sasaram and Bargarh remained vacant for the greater part of the year and these alone account for a considerable portion of the decrease. The falling off noted against Hoogbly, Alipore, Nadia, Hajipur, Sitamarhi, Darjeeling, Angul, Sambalpur and Dhan- baid is very noticeable and is reported to be due to the less prevalence of foot and mouth and other contagious diseases or the inclusion of inoculations in the previous year's figures. 31. I regret to have to record that the veterinary assistants at Dinapore, Berhampore and Alipore had to be dismissed, the first for submitting false diaries, the second for sending in false returns of inoculations performed by him in the Sunderbunds, and the last for unsatisfactory work. In consequence of frequent inspections and bad reports on their work the assistants of Sassa- ram, Dumka and Nadia thought fit to resign. 32. The itinerant veterinary assistants of Purnea, Bhagalpur, Monghyr, Muzaffarpur, Champaran, Gaya, Shahabad, Burdwan, Hooghly, Cuttack, Man- bhum, Balasore and Hazaribagh must be recommended for their work. The veterinary assistants of Puri, Khurda, Murshidabad and Nadia are not giving satisfaction. 33. In submitting the returns of the assistants for the year errors have as far as possible been eliminated and they represent accurately the assistants' work in the mufassal, excluding those cases for which advice was given, and inoculations. The medicine depôts which some District Boards have estab- lished have been a success and in some the out-of-the-way thanas they have proved very useful. 34. The graduates who have joined the cadre during the past year are much superior in physique and intelligence to those of previous years Strong active youths are required where livestock are dealt with, and these qualifica- tions are especially necessary in the case of itinerant assistants who have to undergo considerable hardships when on tour. HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES. 35. Tables V and VI( 5 ) 42. Palamau.( 6 ) plague interfered to a certain extent with the work of the hospital. The veterinary assistant continues to inspect the slaughter-house, the meat market and municipal cattle for which he receives a fee of Rs. 12-8 a month from the municipality and Rs. 25 from the District Board. One hundred and sixty-four operations were performed against 154 in 1909-10, 56. Balasore.( 7 ) 66. The demand for bulls for breeding purposes is increasing as many applications from both public bodies and private individuals were received during the year. In many instances it was impossible to comply with their demands, 67. As the herds at Siripore and Bettiah are supplying bulls for their estates only, it is hoped Government will seriously consider the question of starting a large breeding farm of its own in some Bihar district as early as possible as the present arrangement of searching the country for Brahmini bulls is not a good one; and moreover it is impossible any longer to meet the demands from this source. By a herd of 150 to 200 cows and the purchase yearly of a number of promising desi bull calves a large number of bulls would be available for distribution after a few years. Court of Wards' estates and private individuals are all anxious to secure cattle. 68. During the year under report an Inspector was deputed to the Punjab to purchase buffalo-bull calves and buck goats. He succeeded in securing some very good specimens. An outbreak of rinderpest, however, broke out among them before they started south, and resulted in the death of four animals. 69. Bull-rearing and breeding farms.( 8 ) 78. Bettiah.( 9 ) transferred to the Bengal Veterinary College for 12 months, the department receiving in exchange Mr. B. L. Sur. During the remaining three mouths of the year the latter visited three hospitals, inspected the work of four assistants, attended 11 outbreaks of cattle disease and visited nine thanas to check the inoculation work of the veterinary assistants. 89. Mr. P. N. Das( 10 ) 100. Twenty hill cattle were purchased in Kalimpong and sent to Muktesar for experiment with regard to their susceptibility to rinderpest. 101. During the year also Major Holmes has been supplied with cases of Kumri from Champaran district and a further supply is being collected for him. If these experiments prove successful in elucidating the cause of this fatal disease and in determining a cure, a great benefit will have been conferred on horse-owners in this part of India, as the mortality is a cause of considerable annual loss. Cases of a disease simulating Kumri have been reported among the goats in the north of Champaran. PART V.-EXPENDLTURE OP THE DEPARTMENT. 102. Table XIV(a) shows the cost of the department during the year. PART VI.-GENERAL REMARKS. 103. Substantial progress has been made during the year in nearly every branch of the department, though it is considerably handicapped by the large number of young inexperienced graduates. 104. Many District Boards from want of funds are unable to employ more men than they now have and in those districts where diseases are wide- spread and only one veterinary assistant, work under such conditions is unsatisfactory. 105. The efficacy of preventive inoculation is beginning to be recognized, and people who now ask for it, were quite against its introduction some short time ago. 106. The question of making provision for a second Superintendent for the department is brought to the notice of Government. With the rapid development of the department it is impossible to keep in that touch with Inspectors and veterinary assistants which is so essential, and moreover it leaves no time for investigation of diseases, a subject which does not receive the attention which it deserves; personal enquiries into outbreaks; the efficacy of the serum and vaccines that are now used, are a few out of a large number of subjects which should receive special attention; there are therefore very strong reasons why a second officer should be employed at an early date. 107. The new scheme for the formation of a Provincial Veterinary Service was sanctioned during the year but was not brought into operation. 108. Rules for the guidance of itinerating veterinary assistants, and for the management of hospitals and dispensaries have been submitted to the Director of Agriculture for approval. A set of uniform rules for this province is urgently needed. 109. The rules under the Glanders and Farcy Act submitted last year have not yet been sanctioned by Government. It is regretted that epizootic lymphangitis and surra have not been placed under the Glanders and Farcy Act as applied to the whole province. Two cases of surra were met with, and were it not for the public spirit shown by the owner of the diseased horses, they could not have been destroyed, 110. Poisoning of cattle in the districts of Jessore, Khulna and Madia is believed to be the cause of serious mortality. 111- The Cruelty to Animals Act does not seem to work very smoothly in many municipalities, if one is to judge by the number of ponies which are unfit for service and that are daily allowed to ply for hire. 112. In Gaya and Burdwan and in those municipalities which lie on the river Hooghly, north of Howrah, there are a large number of ponies which are unfit for work of any kind, from festering collar galls, lameness, bad shoeing, old age debility, etc. The educated portion of the native community in some cases are as big offenders as the gharrywallah. The penalties inflicted by the majority of trying Magistrates seem to be totally inadequate. Fines, without compelling owners to give their animals sufficient time to recover from their wounds, lameness, etc, are no deterrent. It fre- quently happens that owners are fined, and after paying, they take their animals away from court and work them the same day.
( 11 ) 113. The condition of the stables in most municipalities leaves much to be desired. If local authorities would only employ the powers given them under the Municipal Act, to compel owners to keep their stables in a a good sanitary condition, it would relieve a great deal of the present suffering. 114. Rabies still continues to rage in most of the municipalities and districts of the province. One planter in Bihar lost two valuable horses by the bite of a rabid dog, while there were a large number of instances in which persons had to go to Kasauli for treatment, as the result of bites. 115. Proposals will shortly be placed before Government for increasing the travelling allowance of the veterinary assistants in the Presidency, Burdwan and Orissa Divisions, as it is found that the sum of Rs. 15 per month is insufficient to meet the expenses of an itinerant assistant in those divisions if he has to tour for 22 days a month. 116. Work in the office still continues to increase, as 6,277 and 4, 657 letters were received and issued during the year, against 5,250 and 4,167, for 1909-10. D.
