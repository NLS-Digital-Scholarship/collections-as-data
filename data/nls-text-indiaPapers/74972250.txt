REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1871. No. 247A. FROM J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 31st May 1872. SIR, Medical College Hospital, General Hospital, Calcutta Nurses' Institution, Municipal Pauper Hospital, Municipal Police Hospital, Calcutta Lock Hospitals. I HAVE the honor to present the returns and reports of the institutions marginally enumerated for the calendar year 1871. These institu- tions constitute those of the Metropolitan public medical charities whose administration is vested in my office; but in order to furnish a more complete view of the amount of hospital and dispensary relief provided for the sick-poor of Calcutta and its suburbs, and to give a wider and truer conception of the comparative healthiness of the year, as indicated by hospital statistics, as well as of the operation of individual institutions as contrasted with others, I shall refer to the report of the Native Hospital and its affiliated dispensaries, with a copy of which I have been favoured by Surgeon N. C. Macnamara, the Superintendent, and to the reports of the Sukea's Street Dispensary, the North Suburban Hospital, the Bhowanipore (Sumbhoo Nath Pundit) Hospital, the Alipore and Aratoon Apcar Dispensaries, and the Howrah Hospital, which will be given in greater detail in the general report of provincial hospitals and dispensaries. Institutions report- ed on.

Gener- ous feeding is of small avail in cases on which death has set its mark before they come within the sphere of hospital treatment, and it is these cases which have hither- to swelled the death tables of the Metropoli- tan hospitals. The de- crease of cholera, which will be specially noticed in a subsequent para- graph, accounts in a large measure for the marked reduction in the mortality rates of 1870 and 1871. This appears clearly from the adjoining valuable table drawn up by Dr. C. Macnamara from information obtained from the officers in charge of the hospitals whose statistics are represented and published in the Indian Medical Gazette for 1st May 1872. Decrease of cholera. From this statement it appears that, while there is in the four hospitals concerned a slight reduction of mortality when cholera cases are excluded, this is not nearly so great or striking as when cholera cases are included. Higher death-rate among natives. Another remarkable circumstance, which is prominently noticed by Dr. Chevers in his report, and is clearly illustrated in statement No. VI, is the higher death-rate among natives. This feature is observable in the general death-rate and in the death-rate of particular diseases, more especially cholera, fever, diarrh6 REPORT ON THE General conclusion. The broad conclusion from the foregoing analysis is that these hospitals are an excel- lent indication of the health of the community. When their statistics are so dependent on the circumstances of the community, it is extremely difficult, or almost impossible, to estimate how much of an improvement in the general death-rate, or that of any particular diseases, or the reverse, is due to the altered circumstances of the hospitals themselves; and the considerations above adduced show how necessary it is to consider their transactions in one general report, as is now done for the first time.

The principal causes of admission into these hospitals all seem to be fevers, bowel complaints and injuries; and the principal causes of death, fevers, bowel complaints, injuries, cholera, phthisis and tetanus. The number of deaths from dropsy, debility and spleen disease in the Pauper Hospital is remarkable. The number of cases of typhoid fever treated in the same institution is very remarkable if the diagnosis has been exact. There are three diseases which demand more particular notice, namely, small-pox, cholera, and venereal disease. For the prevention of small-pox and venereal disease, elaborate and expensive arrangements have been made, and the diminution of cholera in Calcutta within the last two years is a well known fact. The cause of this decrease is a subject of immense importance. Small-pox. STATEMENT No. VII. YEARS. Deaths from small- pox. Years. Deaths from small- pox. Years. Deaths from small- pox. Years.

There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of these figures, and those of the last two years have undergone a rigid check in this office, and are in accord with the detailed returns of diseases submitted with the annual reports of the institutions in question. They have, further, been sent back for special examination and report, and no other circumstance that would account satisfactorily for the marked reduction of cases of venereal disease treated, which has taken place since the establishment of the Lock Hospital, has been brought to light. It will be shown below that the amount of venereal disease among registered prostitutes has also decreased, and it is impossible to doubt that the effect of the arrangements established under Act XIV of 1868 has been beneficial.

THE abstract on the margin gives a succinct view of the operations of the different departments of this hospital as contrasted with the previous year. There has been a slight decrease of 131 in the number of patients treated in-door, while the out-door attend- ance shows an increase of 3,184. This increase is manifest in every department of the hospital except the admission-room and dental dis- pensary, where there is a decrease. The cases shown under the head of admission-room are persons applying for admission who receive medical treatment and are not admitted as in-door patients. They are in reality out-door cases, and registered as such in returns Nos. 1 and 2. Transactions of the year. STATEMENT No. XI. YEAR. DEATH-RATE PER 1,000 AMONG ADULTS. EUROPEANS. EAST INDIANS.

The results of 1871 are very favourable. There has been a reduction of the death-rate both among Europeans and Natives The death-rate among the latter however, continues to be about three times as great as among the former. It is also shown by Dr. Chevers that the rates of fevers, cholera and bowel complaints are much higher among Natives than Europeans. The admissions from cholera have been unprecedentedly few, and the death- rates from this disease among both Europeans and Natives contrast favourably with those of previous years. It will be seen that while the death-rate among European males and females differs very slightly, and is rather more severe among the latter, the rate among male Eurasians exceeds female Eurasians, and that of male Natives is greatly in excess of female Natives. This is a most remarkable fact, and is generally in keeping with the experience of previous years, as the marginal statement will prove. Reduction of death- rate. Death rates accord- ing to race and sex. The striking fact of a nearly equal death-rate among male and female Europeans is not in accordance with the experience for former years. The only explanation I can offer with regard to the excess of deaths among males is that their cases are more severe and less Excess of death- rate among males. C
10 REPORT ON THE amenable to treatment. The circumstance again confirms the opinion I have above expressed, that the death-rate of hospitals must depend more on conditions and influences beyond than within the hospital. Death-rate of me- dical and surgi- cal cases. 11. The ratio of deaths among medical cases was 150.4 per 1,000, and among surgical 93.1, against 168.3 and 94.6 of 1870. The death-rate of surgical operations, 155.77, compares favourably with that of the two previous years. The number of casualties under this head presumed to depend on hospitalism, though in excess of 1870, contrasts favourably with former years. This leads me to the subject of the necessity of constructing a new hospital, on which I would offer a few remarks. Question of con- structing a now hospital. 12. The subject of improving and extending the present hospital accommodation was again raised in August 1871. The Government of India had renewed the offer made in 1869, of assigning three lakhs of rupees for the purpose of constructing a new hospital provided a corresponding sum could be obtained from public subscriptions, and the offer was rendered more liberal by a promise of the same grant if an equal sum could be obtained from the muni- cipality or from provincial revenues. His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, in referring the matter for the opinion of the Principal and Professors, stated that he should consider it his duty to find the three lakhs in some way or other, and thus in effect placed six lakhs at disposal for the purpose of extending and improving the construction of the hospital. It was suggested that if the scheme of abandoning the present site and building a new hospital were insisted on, the matter would be indefinitely postponed. There was reason to believe that the present site was not incapable of improvement, and might be rendered healthy by "exten- ded area, improved drainage, and reformed buildings." His Honor, therefore, recommended that thought should be taken to utilize the large sum which could now be rendered available in extending and improving the present site, and providing a new surgical hospital. The matter was referred to this office for opinion. I stated that, while the construction of a new hospital on a better site, and in accordance with the hygienic principles and rules of the present day, would be the best measure, still, if funds were not available for the purpose, the erection of new separate surgical and obstetric hospitals adjoining the present hospital would be the next best alternative, and would be an immense improvement. The existing building would continue to be used for the purposes of a medical hospital. Dr. Chevers, supported by Doctors Fayrer and Ewart, placed on record a strong opinion that the present hospital was unsuited for the accommodation of sick of any description11 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. and practice of the Medical Department; but the Deputy Inspector-General was cautioned to exercise the function of supervision and control inherent in his office "with a proper con- sideration for the position of the eminent medical officers who are entrusted with the charge of the various wards of the hospital." I am glad to be able to report now that the relations which have existed between the officers of the hospital and the administra- tive officer at the Presidency have been of the most pleasant kind, and that the arrange- ment re-established in February has been characterized by harmony and co-operation. 14. An incident occurred in January which rendered it evident that the preparation of a code of rules for the guidance of the subordinates doing duty in the wards of the hospital was desirable. The medical officers were accordingly requested to draw up a set of instructions indicating precisely the duties of House Surgeons and Sub-Assistant Surgeons ordinarily and in cases of emergency, and suspend them in the wards and waiting rooms. These instructions have been satisfactorily complied with. Rules for the con- duct of subordi- nates. 1. Discharged cured. 2. Ditto relieved. 3. Ditto otherwise. (The precise mode or cause of discharge to be indi- cated by foot-note.) 4. Died. 15. The revision of the forms of returns was also discussed. It was considered desirable to show the issue of cases treated more precisely, and more particularly to distinguish cases "cured," from those "relieved," and to state more accurately the causes of removal of persons leaving the hospital or removed from it before either cure or relief had been obtained. The results of cases will accordingly be shown in future as on the margin. The change could not be effected this year, because the registers had not been kept up according to the form in question.Amendment of forms. 16. The appointment of a Resident Physician, which was finally sanctioned in October 1871, will undoubtedly add most materially to the efficiency of the hospital staff, and Assistant Surgeon McConnell, M.D., who was appointed on the 15th of December to the conjoined duties of Resident Physician and Professor of Pathology, gives every promise of filling these important posts with credit to himself and benefit to the institution.A Resident Phy- sician appointed. 17. Dr. Chevers mentions in his report that more liberal and elastic rates of dieting came into operation on the 1st of April 1871. The circumstances under which this change came about are as follows:12 REPORT ON -THE there was a saving under the head of European diets, the prices paid for several important articles, such as meat and milk, were not such as to admit of the best quality being obtained. They objected further to the system of the same man, the purveyor, negotiating the purchase of diet and supervising its issue. They, accordingly recommended the raising of the rates of European diet from eight annas ten pie to twelve annas per man per day, and of Native diet from four annas to six annas, and the obtaining of food supplies by public contract. Both these recommendations were supported in this office, and sanctioned by Government in letter No. 616, dated 22nd February 1871. A recommendation was subsequently made by this office in May that diet bills should be submitted in the first instance to the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, and, after having undergone professional scrutiny by him, transmitted to the Examiner of Medical Accounts for final and financial audit. This practice, it was urged, was consonant with that of other hospitals, and would give the institution the benefit of the wide experience in such matters of the administrative medical officer of the circle. It was ruled, however, (Bengal Government letter No 1702, dated 1st June 1871,) that the system laid down in Financial resolution No. 1721, dated 30th March 1867, should continue in force, namely, that the bills for dieting should be transmitted by the Principal direct to the Examiner of Medical Accounts, and that they should be paid on his audit. Increased expendi- ture on dieting 18. It will be observed from Dr. Chevers' report that the diet allowance, as it now stands, is more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the institution, and the officers of the hospital, in their efforts to provide a generous diet for the sick, will neither be compelled to incur personal obligations nor exceed the authorized limits of expenditure. The following statement, which has been prepared under the orders of the Principal, shows that during the last three years there has been a steady rise in the cost of dieting, although the enhanced rates did not come into operation till the 1st of April of the year under report. The conclusion that the sick are being better fed is inevitable, for the prices of food supplies have not risen during this period. STATEMENT No. XII.

Dr. Charles has submitted a special report on the subject of training females in the practice of midwifery. I shall, before offering any remarks on this report, recall the circum- stances of the movement ab initio as far as it concerns the Medical College Hospital, leaving the discussion of what has been done in the same direction in mofussil hospitals and dispensaries to the general report of those institutions. In July 1869 the Government of India inquired whether the system of training native women in midwifery, which had been tried at Bareilly in the North-Western Provinces, might not be attempted in Bengal. Dr. Charles, who was requested to report on the subject, pointed out that large training schools for midwives had been established on the continent of Europe, and that a similar scheme for Bengal would entail great expense, while it would be objectionable to collect together in a large city the class of females who would be found willing to undergo instruction in midwifery. As an experiment he proposed that twenty females should be attached on a stipend of Rs. 5 a month to the midwifery wards of the Medical College Hospital for six months. In order to instruct and train these he proposed that a scholarship of Rs. 15 a month should be given to the best midwifery student of the 4th year, that a Bengali woman should be employed on Rs. 15 a month with free rations, and that three pupils should get Rs. 5 each for services as pupil teachers. Dr. Chevers, in forwarding this report, objected to young girls being attached to the school, and proposed that six professional midwives of 30 to 35 years of age should be attached to the midwifery wards for practical train- ing in the capacity of nurses. Mr. Saunders supported the proposal to employ a limited number of middle-aged women as nurse-midwives, and this view was supported by the Inspec- tor-General of Hospitals and adopted by Government in submitting the case for the orders of the Government of India. It was proposed to attach six such persons on a stipend of Rs. 6 a month to the Medical College Hospital and General Hospital respectively. This proposal was sanctioned (Financial Resolution No. 2570, dated 19th November 1869), and communi- cated for compliance to the Principal of the Medical College Hospital and Surgeon of the General Hospital. The latter reported (20th April 1870) that the midwifery practice of the hospital was very limited (12 confinements per annum) and did not offer sufficient opportunity of practical training. Dr. Chevers represented (29th March) that all attempts to induce women to come to the hospital had failed. The stipend was also said to be too low to act as a sufficient inducement. Government, on the representation of this office, agreed (11th May) to limit the experiment to the Medical College Hospital, and sanctioned the payment of Rs. 9 per mensem to eight women. These orders were duly communicated. Dr. Chevers reported (10th December 1870) that one woman had joined and three others were expected. He solicited sanction for the employment of a Christian matron on Rs. 20 a month, and pressed the adoption of the arrangements originally recommended by Dr. Charles for instructing the women, and the erection of a tiled hut to accommodate them. Dr. Chevers was instructed that he should use the means at his disposal, and that the Inspector-General was not disposed to recommend the very considerable additional expenditure (Rs. 65 a month) it was proposed to incur for the instruction of a few women. A special report was called for on the subject of accommodation. It was finally resolved (Bengal Government letter No. 341, dated 28th January 1871,) that no increased expenditure could be permitted, that it appeared objec- tionable to place any more buildings on the hospital compound, and that the plan might be tried of allowing the women to lodge outside the College premises, attending daily for instruc- tion. These arrangements were accordingly carried out. In May it was represented that the first woman who had come forward for instruction had become a prostitute, and that, through the exertions of Baboos Keshub Chunder Sen and Nil Madub Mookerjee, several young women had joined the hospital. Dr. Chevers again pressed the propriety of entertaining a matron to look after the females who had joined, now amounting to the full complement of eight. Government (No. 2429 of 1st August 1871) approved of the representation of this office that it was a mistake to entertain young women, that the number should be limited to six, and the two remaining stipends absorbed in obtaining the services of a matron, who should look after the women, who might be hutted or lodged together outside the hospital premises. Training females in midwifery. D
14 REPORT ON THE Dr. Charles' report sets forth the progress of the experiment up to the close of 1871. Ten women had been received for training: three of these were removed for immorality; one for disobedience of orders; one ceased attending; one was withdrawn by her friends; one pro- mised well, and the remaining three underwent a satisfactory examination on the subject of natural labor. Dr. Charles places some strong remarks on record regarding the three unfor- tunate women who appear to have gone astray; but from the first the intention has been to attempt to render dhais already in practice more skilful and safe, rather than to train young women to the profession of midwives. The arrangements, moreover, sanctioned in the letter of 1st August 1871 have not been carried out. Dr. Charles would have made the case clearer had he given some information regarding the age, caste, social position and antecedents of these women. There can be no doubt that the experiment would be more promising in a separate lying-in-hospital with separate compound and quarters provided for the nurses either in the hospital or in the compound. This however does not exist now, and I would propose that the three females who have shown such aptitude in acquiring theoretical knowledge should be retained until Dr. Charles considers them fitted to practice as nurse-midwives skilfully, that no more young females should be entertained for instruction, that if possible elderly dhais in actual practice should be recruited to fill up vacancies and maintain the sanctioned strength, and that the six women under instruction should be lodged in one place close to the hospital, and looked after by a respectable elderly native female on a salary of Rs. 18 a month. If these conditions cannot be realized, it would be well to discontinue the experiment until a separate lying-in-hospital has been provided. It might then be tried with better prospects of success. Finances. 20. It is satisfactory to find that considerable savings have been effected on the budget allowance under several heads. The figures, however, refer to the calendar year, while the budget grant covers the financial year, and it is difficult to say on what principle the calcu- lations have been made. The subject will be more appropriately treated when considering the budget grant of the ensuing year. Dr. Chevers has appended to his report a statement of legacies and other monies which have from time to time become available for increasing the comfort of the hospital or being expended for the benefit of the patients. There seems to have been a disposition to accumulate such funds. I cannot perceive the necessity or advantage of doing so, as all the wants of the hospital are met and are likely to be met by Government in a liberal spirit. I would accordingly recommend that the interest of invested money be expend- ed as it becomes due, and that floating balances be utilized in adding to the amenities of hospital life. 21. I have much pleasure in stating that the affairs of this hospital have been conducted with their wonted ability and skill by the distinguished medical officers who have held office in this institution during the year. THE GENERAL HOSPITAL. 22. DR. EWART's report is most able and interesting, and presents a valuable and instructive view of the medical transactions of the year, and an excellent comparison of the results of 1871 with those of previous years. This report, together with the figured returns, is appended in extenso. Advantage of early treatment. 23. I would draw particular attention to the remarks made regarding the propriety of sending cases for treatment during the earlier stages of disease, when remedies are found to be of most avail. This is more particularly desirable in cases of cholera, and when it lies with masters of vessels to send seamen to the hospital, there would appear to be no difficulty as regards this class of cases. I would suggest that Government should authorita- tively impress upon the community, more especially the seafaring community, the advantage of early recourse to treatment.
15 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 24. The account which Dr. Ewart gives regarding the advantages gained in a certain class of cases from the employment of Dieulafoy's pneumatic aspirator, is worthy of notice. An instrument of this description has recently been supplied to the hospital. Dieulafoy's pneu- matic aspirator. 25. It is very satisfactory to observe that when tested by surgical and puerperal cases, this hospital is so free from those insalubrious influences commonly indicated by the term hos- pitalism, which result from the aggregation of a certain class of cases in improperly constructed and insufficiently ventilated buildings. The results which experience has shown to be due to these influences, have been for many years painfully manifest in the Medical College Hospital. Dr. Ewart employs this immunity as one argument for extending the surgical practice of the hospital. I admit the force of the argument, and recognise the desirability of the pro- posal; but I am opposed, both for the sake of the patients and the hospital, to locating surgical cases in the basement rooms of the hospital. If the wards now occupied by the sick of the regiment of British Infantry stationed in Fort William are added to the General Hospital, the assignment of a certain number of beds to the class of persons and cases alluded to by the Surgeon will be in every respect a good measure. Absence of hospi- talism. Proposal for ex- tending the sur- gical practice of the hospital. 26. Dr. Ewart also proposes that an out-door department should be added to the hospital. I agree that this would be a great advantage to the sick poor of southern Calcutta; but if the present staff is employed to the full, an arrangement of this kind would necessitate an increased staff. On this subject Dr. Ewart will be asked to submit a special report. I would remark, however, that the Alipore, Bhowanipore, and Aratoon Apear dispensaries already provide out-door medical and surgical relief for the sick poor of the suburbs of Bhowanipore, Alipore, and Garden Reach. An out-door de- partment pro- posed. 27. The Surgeon's remarks on the subject of dieting are important. The dieting of the sick is obviously the alphabet of hospital management, and too much care cannot be bestowed upon the subject. Dr. Ewart will be asked to submit a definite proposal regarding the provi- sion of covered trays or doolies for the purpose of serving the food warm to the patients. The public contract system evidently works satisfactorily in this hospital. Dieting 28. The improvements effected in the manner of disposing of hospital sewage are in every respect a subject of congratulation, and I hope that ere long the arrangements which have been during the year under discussion for the purpose of introducing the pure municipal water into the hospital, and providing for it a system of water sewerage in connection with the general combined drainage and sewerage of the city, will be satisfactorily completed. Conservancy. 29. Surgeon-Major J. P. Brougham, M.D., who had held the office of Surgeon to this hospital during the previous twelve years with much credit to himself and great benefit to the community, retired from the service on the 31st of March, and was succeeded by Surgeon J. Ewart, M.D., under whose able supervision the institution promises to maintain its well earned popularity. Changes in the staff. 30. The office of Second Assistant Surgeon having become vacant towards the close of the year 1870 by the appointment of the late Assistant-Surgeon J. Fawcus to the office of Inspector-General of Jails, it was decided to dissever the superintendence of the Alipore and Russa jails from the Second Assistant Surgeoncy of the hospital, and constitute the former a sole and separate charge. As the full salary which had been drawn for the combined duty was allotted to the Alipore Jail charge, and the Government of India objected to the appoint- ment of an additional medical officer at the Presidency, it become a question how the hospital duties could best be provided for. It was finally resolved, after considerable discus- sion (Bengal Government letters Nos. 1183 and 2399, dated 18th April and 31st July,) to unite the Second Assistant Surgeoncy of the hospital with the office of Superintendent of the Presidency Jail. Assistant Surgeon S. C. Mackenzie, M.D., has throughout the year performed this combined duty, and nothing has occurred to show that it is not the most satisfactory.
16 REPORT ON THE arrangement that could have been made under the circumstances. I am still, however, of opinion that the charge of the Presidency Jail is too onerous an additional duty for the Second Assistant Surgeon of the hospital, though I am aware that no change can be made for the present. Transfer to the Civil Depart- ment. 31. The transfer of the hospital to the Civil Department was rendered complete by the building being from the 1st of April made over to the civil authorities, and since then the hospital furniture has been similarly dealt with. The institution is now in every parti- cular administered and treated as a civil hospital. Medical aid for destitute Euro- peans. 32. A question arose during the year regarding the provision of medical aid and treat- ment for destitute Europeans. As far as Calcutta is concerned, the General and Medical College Hospitals leave nothing to be desired in this respect. The rules under which patients are admitted into the former of these hospitals are placed in the appendix. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. 33. THE circumstances of this most useful institution are more satisfactory than they were represented to be in the report of 1870. The public has responded so liberally to the ap- peal for aid that the year closed with a considerable surplus, and an addition to the staff of nurses was contemplated. The testimony borne by the chief medical officers of the Medical College and General Hospitals to the value of the services rendered by the nurses is warm: the element of nursing has now become all over the world a necessary and indispensable part of hospital administration. The report of the Committee of this institution is appended. MUNICIPAL PAUPER HOSPITAL. The Pauper Hospi- tal a better index of the salubrity of Calcutta than the others. 34. THIS hospital is a better index of the salubrity of the town than all the others put together, because it receives all-comers, and is also the receptacle of cases which are rejected from other hospitals, because they offer no hope of successful treatment or cannot be accommodated. The following statement gives a synopsis of the statistics of this hospital since its opening. The reduction of the death-rate is marked and satisfactory, and can be explained in no other way than by the greater healthiness of Calcutta. STATEMENT No. XIII. YEARS. Total treated.

The cost of dieting patients is moderate, amounting to about 2 annas 3 pie per patient per day including spirits; and, considering the class of cases treated, is greatly below what is found necessary in the Medical College Hospital, where 4 annas a day has been found insufficient. In the Native Hospital the rate is about 2 annas 7 pie a day. It will be observed that the death-rate of the latter institution is considerably lower than that of the other two. The average cost of supplying food and stimulants to the in-door sick of all the mofussil hospitals and dispensaries was in 1870, 1 anna 9.1 pie per patient per day. The mortality was 161.7 per 1,000. A priori the Pauper Hospital should show the highest figure because feeble and moribund cases requiring stimulants form a larger proportion of the sick treated there than elsewhere. The cost of dieting at the Medical College Hospital appears, on comparison with other institutions, extravagant, and Dr. Chevers states that at one time the daily rate of 6 annas for native patients was found insufficient!

THIS hospital draws its sick from a known strength of selected adult males. These males are moreover distributed throughout the city, and liable to all the influences which modify health or cause disease. The statistics of the institution are therefore both interesting and valuable as an index of the health of the town. It is therefore satisfactory to find that the figures of 1871 are generally below those of past years. This result tallies with the statistics of other hospitals, and the inferred remarkable salubrity of Calcutta in 1871 stands on a basis of demonstration. Satisfactory re- sults. 38. The hospital itself is in a most unsatisfactory state. The circumstances brought to notice by Dr. Woodford in his report are most serious. In place of the hospital being a place where ailments are cured, diseases seem there to assume aggravated and dangerous forms, and new diseases of a serious nature are said to be induced by the evil influences of the surroundings. It is most imperatively necessary that something should be done to remedy this unfortunate state of things. If the sanitary improvement of the neighbourhood does not cause an entire cessation of the evil effects noted by Dr. Woodford, the hospital must unhesitatingly be abandoned. I have requested the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals to submit a special report on the subject. State of the hos- pital. CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 39. IN accordance with paragraph 4 of the Government resolution dated 28th April 1871 on the reports concerning the working of Act XIV of 1868 in the town of Calcutta for the year 1870, Dr. Payne has submitted a report on the medical transactions of the Lock Hospitals under his superintendence, which, with remarks thereon by the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, I submit in extenso (Appendix). 40. The Superintendent shows that there has been a marked reduction in the amount of venereal disease among registered prostitutes; of this fact there can be no doubt, and the con- clusion that this class of diseases must also have undergone a corresponding reduction among the Calcutta population is a priori inevitable. This conclusion is moreover supported by the special returns which have been, at Dr. Payne's instance, submitted by the Superintendents of hospitals and dispensaries, and of which I have given a summary in paragraph 8. Reduction of vene- real disease. E
18 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Cost of the Lock Hospitals. 41. It is satisfactory to find that the cost of these hospitals has diminished. A voluminous correspondence has taken place during the year regarding the reduction of hospitals and hospital establishments. As the issue of this correspondence belongs to the year now current, and the various matters represented are still under discussion and consideration, I defer any summary of, or comments upon, the subject until next year, when I hope to be in a position to present a complete narrative of all that shall have transpired.

Calcutta Police Hospital, 2nd March. Calcutta Lock Hospitals, 19th April. 42. I have been unable to submit this report sooner, because the material on which it is founded was late in reaching my office, and it became necessary to call for explanations, &amp;c., regarding many matters treated of in the reports. The dates of receipt of the various documents are specified marginally, and the reply to my last reference only reached me on the 29th of May. The delay has thus been unavoidable. 43. The system of bringing together the transactions of all the public medical insti- tutions of Calcutta in one report is a great improvement, as it admits of discussing matters common to all the institutions from a wider point of view, and I anticipate that these summary reports, of which this is the first, will in time form a valuable series, and contain information in a compact and convenient shape, which will year by year acquire greater interest and importance. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, J. CAMPBELL BROWN, Inspector-General of Hospitals, Indian Medical Dept. K. MCLEOD, A.M., M.D., Asstt. Surgeon, offg. Secretary.
REPORT OF THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL, FOR THE YEAR 1871. DURING the year, 3,888 in-door patients were treated (exclusive of those admitted to the General results. Eye Infirmary). Out of these, 491 cases were fatal. This gives a mortality rate of 126.28 per thou- sand, against 138.78 in 1870 and 179.40 in 1869. Of these 491 deaths, 78 occurred in less than 24 hours after admission into hospital. If these utterly hopeless cases were excluded from the return, the death-rate would be 106.22 per thousand. Of the above in-patients, 1,772 were Christians, of whom 99 died, or 55.86 per thousand. Of these 99, 18 died within 24 hours after admission. The mortality rates among the Christian inmates were 65.30 in 1870, 78.90 in 1869, 87.30 in 1868, and 67.39 in 1867. In the preceding 15 years the rate was 95.52. The Native in-patients numbered 2,116, of whom 392 died, or 185.25 per thousand. Of these, 60 died within 24 hours after admission, and if these be excluded, the death-rate will be 156.89 per thousand. The corresponding rates in the three preceding years were 198.27 in 1870, 253 43 in 1869, and 255.94 in 1868. The rate for the past 15 years was 235.48. Statistics of Christian Patients.

One woman who came to the hospital for a day is not included in the following statement. Ten women have been under training; two of them have been dismissed for immoral conduct; another dismissed herself it is believed when she found that she was pregnant. She aborted and died of lock-jaw. One was discharged for habitual disobedience of orders and absenting herself without leave. One woman ceased attending after a fortnight's instruction. Results. The above form five instances of what may be taken as failures connected with the experiment of educating nurses. Three out of the five did learn something, but too little to justify me in holding them up as examples of even partial success. Of the other half, the report is a much more favourable one. One woman at present under training has been too short a time with us to say much about her, but she promises to do well. One woman after 18 months' training is known to have made very considerable progress, but her friends decided that she should not practise, and she ceased attending at the hospital. Other three women appeared before an Examination Committee as detailed in the next paragragh. Bunnoo, Pootee, Icha. 4. On the 3rd of January 1872 I requested Meer Ashruf Ali, the Native Teacher of Midwifery, and Baboo Kristo Dass Sen, the Goodeve scholar, to associate themselves with me and form a Committee of Examination to test the proficiency of the Native midwives. The examination was limited to the subject of natural labor and the management of ordinary cases. I suggested all the questions in English, but from my ignorance of the language in which the examination was conducted, I can only offer a guarded opinion as to the result. All three candidates showed a " good" knowledge of the subject, and I was peculiarly struck by the volubility with which they answered and the readiness with which they understood each question which was put to them. Having satisfied myself that they possessed the neces- sary information on this large and important division of their subject, these three dhais were directed to get up in the same way the subject of preternatural labor; when they seem to show a sufficient general knowledge of this further subject, it is proposed again to put them to a similar formal test. The names of these three pupils are mentioned in the margin. I have good reasons for believing that the fitness they showed to learn was exceptional, and that none of the other women we have had under training would at any time have attained to such proficiency, even had they not been dismissed or absented themselves. One exception to this observation has already been brought forward. Examination. Result. 5. There are at present only four dhais, the other two vacancies have not yet been filled up, as it seems very doubtful whether, under the circumstances, the Government will feel inclined to continue an undertaking which promises such doubtful results. Should it be determined to continue the experiment further, I believe I can easily fill up these two vacan- cies without much delay. Vacancies. 6. Should it be determined not to continue the experiment further, I would suggest that the women at present under training should not be dismissed at once, but that as each is ready to go, no new pupil be recruited to take her place. Suggestions re- garding the fu- ture. 7. In my first report on the subject I drew prominent attention to the fact that if the Government undertook to train women in a metropolis, who had been brought from a quiet life in the country, they must be prepared for the most unpleasant contingencies. Thirty per cent. of the women included in this experiment having gone astray, presents to my mind a result so appalling, that I trust I may not be asked to continue an undertaking necessarily attended with such unhappy results. Should the Government still decide on pursuing the same course, I shall have some observations to make, which I for the present defer. 8. The fact that half of the women have proved themselves competent to acquire a very fair share of such knowledge that they can make an average show at an examination, is most encouraging. It proves that if the Government choose to conduct the experiment at a
28 REPORT OF THE distance from the metropolis, it is certain to be attended with a modicum of success. I feel convinced that such a move would be one in a right direction, and that much good would be done. The expense incurred by European Governments for training midwives is very great; and to effect the same result in India would necessarily involve a large outlay of money. The Native women, even when showing most aptitude to learn theoretically, have shown so little fitness to do anything with their hands, that I question more than ever whether such a reasonable amount of saving of life and suffering among the population would ever be attained to, that any such appropriation of public funds would, in the present circumstances of the country, be justifiable. Memo. by G. SAUNDERS, ESQ., Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals,29 MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. solicited. The mortality, however, in the European wards had never been so remarkably high as in the Native side of the building, and therefore less benefit could be expected from the administration of better food or a more liberal use of extras there. 7. The Inspector-General will find by a reference to different documents bearing on the subject that it was in 1869 when attention was first called to the importance of the supply question to the hospital in its bearing on the treatment of disease and its results, and it was during the year 1870 that a decided change took place for the better in the statistics of the Medical College hospital,30 REPORT OF THE 15. Because, if so, with the best hospital in the world, and operating on people who are ordinarily in an unhygienic state, there will always be a proportion of cases followed by septic disease, and we have seen that in the condemned College Hospital there have been only 2½ per cent. of pyæmia and 2½ of gangrene out of a total of 155 operations. May it not be pos- sible to do more in the future than we have done hitherto to improve the hygienic condi- tion of this section of the hospital sick, seeing that the general death-rate has been already lowered so much in one year by the adoption of measures which were nevertheless at the time of their incidence declared to be unnecessary ? Is an entirely new hospital neces- sary? 16. I have discussed this subject thus fully, because I consider that the lowered death- rate of 1871 in the College Hospital, happening as it has, after the introduction of certain administrative changes in the conduct of the hospital affairs, bears very directly on the large question which still remains for the decision of Government,31 MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

This does not altogether account for the decrement in the death-rate during the past three years, and particularly during the last of the series, for it is apparent from these figures that a certain amount of decrease is fairly sustained even when cholera is excluded from the calculation. Chief causes of death. The chief causes of death for the seven years ending 1871 are illustrated below:49 PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. hospital. It is not surprising therefore that the ratio of deaths to treated has amounted to 76.82 per thousand, and that out of every thousand deaths from all causes, dysentery is answerable for 111.31. Hepatitis. 3. Hepatitis has long formed a subject of careful observation and discrimination at this hospital. In the above statement the term comprises not only inflammation ending in resolu- tion and ultimate reparation, but also those cases which have terminated in abscess. Here again the opportunity of successfully combating inflammation of the liver and preventing its termination in abscess has too often been lost long before the admission of these cases into hospital. There can be no doubt but that by prompt and vigorous treatment such an unfavorable result can often be averted. And, doubtless, the practice followed has had much to say to the fact that the deaths to treated have only been 133.15 per thousand, and that it has only accounted for 44.34 deaths per thousand deaths from all causes. Dieulafoy's pneu- matic aspirator. It may not be out of place here to solicit attention to an ingenious contrivance in the shape of Dr. Dieulafoy's (of Paris) Pneumatic Aspirator (improved by Weiss of London), by means of which the largest abscesses of the liver can be emptied without more pain than is experienced in the employment of drugs by the hypodermic method, and without the admission of atmospheric air, whilst they can be washed out by carbolic acid or other anti- septic solutions, also without the risk of admitting air. It may be used for the emptying and washing out of abscesses in almost every part of the body; and so used, it will very frequently save the patient from the knife and a certain amount of consequent disfigurement, and, it may be, mutilation. Thus, abscesses in the neck may be drained of their contents and thoroughly disinfected through an opening not larger than that which would be made by the insertion of the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe. Iliac abscesses not implicating bone, might also be cured in the same way, and the patient saved from large incisions through the abdominal muscles or below Poupart's ligament. Long standing pleuritic effusions, empyema, and effusion into the pericardium, might also be relieved without in the slightest degree risking insuperable injury to the lungs or heart. Lately, I drew off 74 ounces of pus from a liver abscess of a private patient with this instrument, kindly lent me by Dr. MacConnell. About a week later a pint and a half was removed, and three days afterwards about a pint more, with a hopeful result. When acting as Professor of Medicine in the Medical College, Dr. Buckle, C.B., then Principal Medical Store-Keeper, kindly had an exhausting syringe, provided with a canula armed with stop cock, constructed under my supervision. With this an abscess can be emptied completely and washed out with disinfectant fluids without risking the admission of air; and I have since several times employed it with success. In August last, assisted by Doctors Cutcliffe and Lyons, the patient having been put under the influence of chloroform by Dr. Lyons, I drew of 84 ounces, more than half a gallon, from the liver abscess of an American, a mechanical engineer in the service of Government, with my imperfect and clumsy apparatus, and afterwards washed it out with carbolic acid solution until the last portions came away almost clear and limpid as water. Three days afterwards the canala was reinserted and a pint and a half of puriform matter was removed. Mr. Saunders, the Deputy Inspector-General, kindly assisted me on this occasion. It was also well washed out and disinfected. The patient a couple of days after this sailed in one of the P. and O. Com- pany's steamers. He was troubled with fever as far as Galle, after which he gained a pound per diem between that place and London. Three months afterwards he reported from Philadelphia that his physician had repeatedly examined his liver and assured him that its size was normal, and that but for the statement of his case, with which he had been furnished by me on his departure, he could not have believed that the patient had been the subject of such extensive disease. Circumstances in which its em- ployment is beneficial. A case related. Useful as my instrument is, it is not to be compared for facility of application and painlessness to the patient to Dieulafoy's pneumatic aspirator as improved by Weiss. Typhoid fever. (4.) Typhoid fever has long been recognized in this hospital. The first cases noted in Calcutta were observed and described here by Dr. Scriven, I think, in 1853. Since then scarcely a year has passed without its complement of cases of typhoid fever. During the N
50 REPORT OF THE seven years under review, 85 cases have been diagnosed and entered in the returns. Of these 22 proved fatal, or 258.82 per thousand. Out of a thousand deaths, 19.90 were accounted for by this disease. The mortality to treated is not, according to my experience, so fatal here as in Europe; and this advantage is apparently due to the freer action of the skin, and the comparative immunity from lung complication, whilst, strange to say, the cerebral and intestinal derangements are not materially augmented. I have now made a good many post-mortems in cases of typhoid fever in Rajputana, at the College, General Hospital, and in private cases, and I only know personally of one case of perforation, and one in which death resulted from intestinal h51 PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL.

To criticise all the results as demonstrated in these detailed statements would be premature. A longer series of observation is needed. Their form I propose to maintain in future with such modification as may from time to time appear to be indicated for examin- ation and report. There is however one point to which I beg again to draw attention, viz. the diminution in the number of cholera cases of late years:54 REPORT OF THE population, and adopting measures to prevent the possibility of its becoming polluted by sewage containing cholera poison, will have to be developed in every important town in Lower Bengal. To sanitary measures we must look for the reduction of the sickness and mortality from cholera, inasmuch as it must be admitted that remedies are of little avail unless cases are brought early under treatment, and this is seldom the case in hospital practice. Sickness and mor- tality according to sex and age. In the foregoing statements the whole sickness and mortality amongst men, women and children, have been dealt with collectively. I now propose to show in the subjoined statement how the sickness and mortality have been distributed amongst these three classes during the seven years ending with, and exclusive of, 1871. MEN.

Thus it appears that in no year of the series has the general rate of mortality to treated among men and women been so low as during the past year, whilst in children, with the exception of 1869, the death-rate has been much lower in 1871 than in any of the remain- ing five years. The average ratio of deaths per thousand among men, women and children, during the six years ending 1870, amounted to 68.15, 59.10, and 80.98 respectively; whilst during 1871 it stood at 36.91, 23.52, and 61.22, showing a reduction ofPRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. 55 During my connection with the hospital I have been much struck with the kind manner in which wounds heal both after accident and operation, and also at the singular freedom we have enjoyed from hospitalism, pyæmia, osteomyelitis, tetanus, &c., which immunity may be attributed to the airy and well ventilated condition of my wards, in which most of the operations have been treated. The general or comparative healthiness of the hospital, though by no means a good one according to modern views, may perhaps he admitted as an additional plea in justification of my reiterating the proposal for the institution of a few beds for the treatment of native surgical cases.

It is now removed daily by the conservancy authorities of the suburban municipality from the depôt in the hospital compound in almost hermetically sealed carts to some convenient point, and thrown into the main sewer of the Calcutta drainage works. The plan is a good one, but it has proved more expensive than was originally expected. The proposal to supply the whole of the civil and military buildings of the General Hospital with municipal water, and to connect the latrines with the main sewer underneath the road to the north of the premises, has now advanced a step. Plans and estimates have been submitted by the Garrison Engineer, Fort William, in communication with the Surgeon of the civil hospital and the surgeon of the regimental hospitals. These have been approved by me, and I understand the whole scheme has been finally transmitted in a complete form for the consideration, decision, and orders of the Government of Bengal in the Public Works Department. I look forward to the introduction at an early date of the municipal water-supply and the improved conservancy which will be a necessary complement of the project with great interest, and I trust His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor will be in a position to sanction the necessary outlay for these works, so that they may be completed within the next financial year. The water-closet system is now in operation at the College Hospital, and I believe it is working well, and is regarded by the learned Principal and his distin- guished colleagues as a great improvement upon the old system. State of the Pre- sidency Jail garden. My predecessor, in his report for 1870, re-called attention to the insanitary state of the garden of the Presidency Jail to the north of the hospital. Since the incumbency of the present Superintendent of the Jail this evil has been considerably mitigated. I have however on more than one occasion noted a most offensive smell proceeding from this garden, appa- rently resulting from decaying cabbage leaves and other vegetable matter. I immediately mentioned the subject to Dr. Mackenzie, who at once had the nuisance removed or corrected. If the garden is well kept, and care be taken that the night-soil manure applied to it does not exceed the requirements of ordinary horticultural operations, I do not see how it can be a subject for serious objection. I am confident that the present Superintendent, who is also one of my assistants at the Hospital, will, whilst making this garden a source of profit to the jail, succeed in preventing it from becoming a cause of unhealthiness either to his own important independent charge, or to the General Hospital in the executive duties of which he has also an abiding professional interest.

Patients received into the General Hospital are those whose expenses are defrayed by themselves, and seamen belonging to Her Majesty's ships and merchant vessels under Act III. (B. C.) of 1867. All seaman belonging to vessels in port who may require medical treatment in hospital, will be received so far as available accommodation permits. 2. No seaman belonging to any ship in the port will be received at this institution without the production of a requisition signed by the Master or Commanding Officer of the vessel to which such seaman belongs, except in cases of great emergency, when he will be admitted by the medical officer on duty in anticipation of the order being sent. 3. The authorities authorized to grant the admission of patients into the Presidency General Hospital are Captains of Her Majesty's Navy, Captains of the Government Marine, the Master Attendant, the Marine Surgeon, the Garrison Staff of Fort William, and house- holders of Calcutta, they being answerable for the hospital expenses; the Magistrate of Calcutta and Secretary to the District Charitable Society are authorized to give to paupers free tickets of admission into the hospital. 4. The Presidency Assistant Surgeons also use their discretion in admitting into the hospital any emergent cases which may be brought before them.

Committee. MRS. BEEBEE, MRS. ROWE, " CURTOYS, " SANDERSON, " DAMPIER, " STEPHENSON, MISS MILMAN, " WILKINSON, MRS. BROWNLOW ATLAY, Honorary Secretary. MRS. COWELL, Honorary Treasurer. THIS institution has been in existence twelve years, and has not decreased in usefulness, as will be seen by the reports of the two principal Medical Officers, Dr. Chevers and Dr. Ewart. There are 14 nurses in the Medical College Hospital, including the Matron, Mrs. Bowler, and 9 only in the General Hospital, for the funds being low last year, the Matron, Mrs. Hickey, offered to take more of the work and so dispense with the services of one nurse. She and Mrs. Bowler are most hardworking and obliging, and the Secretary finds that the women recommended by them almost invariably make the best and most respectable nurses. In consequence of the ready response made to the appeal at the beginning of last year, the Committee find themselves with a balance in hand, which they think will allow them to offer two nurses to Dr. Chevers for the wards which hitherto have only been attended to by coolies. Three have long been wished for, and if quarters can be found for two, it is earnestly hoped that the present rate of subscriptions may be maintained, without which it would be impossible to provide for the extra expense. As much care as possible is taken in selecting the nurses, but very great difficulty exists in finding suitable women. Numbers present themselves simply because they want a home, whilst they know nothing of work or nursing. Even the most willing have to learn, which entails a great deal of extra labor on the matrons. This can only be remedied by a training establishment for nurses, which it is to be hoped we shall see at some future day in Calcutta. Thanking the public for past help and begging to remind them that there are frequently 200, mostly Europeans, at one time in the General Hospital, and the same number, Euro- peans and Natives, in the Medical College Hospital, not including the extra Native wards, this report may be best concluded with the valuable testimony of the chief medical officers of the hospitals, contained in the following letters. EMMA ATLAY, Honorary Secretary. I HAVE again great satisfaction in stating that during the past year Mrs. Bowler, the Matron, and the nurses of the Hospital Nurses' Institution under her, have for the most part worked most efficiently and usefully, and have rendered an incalculable amount of valuable aid to the sick in this hospital. I can scarcely imagine a public charity better calculated to do good, both in its objects and in its administration, than is the institution in question. It is a constant source of regret to the officers of this hospital that the funds of the Hospital Nurses' Institution are still so low as to be inadequate to provide us with a full staff of nurses. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL; NORMAN CHEVERS, M.D., CALCUTTA, Principal, Medical College, and Senior Physician. The 20th January 1872. R
66 REPORT OP THE HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. I HAVE been very well satisfied with the manner in which the Matron and the nurses have performed their duties during the past year. I attribute this result mainly to the careful way in which Mrs. Hickey, the Matron, has carried out the important work entrusted to her. I believe the other officers of the hospital have been equally satisfied with the excellent nursing of the sick. It would now be impossible to get on satisfactorily without the nurses, so absolutely' essential have they become to the thorough working of this institution. I trust you will have no difficulty in procuring funds wherewith to maintain our establishment of nurses in full working order. Yours very sincerely, JOSEPH EWART, The 19th January1872.

MEDICAL REPORT OF THE CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. Dated Calcutta, the 15th February 1872. From76 REPORT OF THE Comparison of 1870 and 1871. It will no doubt be considered satisfactory that with a larger number of women the admissions have fallen from 4,474 in 1870 to 2,037 in 1871. The practice in respect of vaginal discharges accounts for much of the difference, but real and great improvement is shown in the reduction of the more serious affections. A. comparative statement will make this evident:CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 77 5. The deaths have as before been few. The causes are78 REPORT OF THE CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 3. It seems remarkable that the mortality has been so small at the Lock hospitals during the past year; and looking to the fact that only three women died from diseases of an asthenic type, it would seem that the prostitute class generally maintain themselves in good health and condition; indeed, that seems to be the general characteristic of the women that have come under my notice in the hospitals; there seems to be little destitution amongst the class generally. 4. I would again invite attention to the high cost at which these hospitals are maintained under the head of establishment. Rs. 109 per patient per annum is a very large sum to pay for the treatment of venereal disease and the inspections which are made at the hospitals. 5. I hope next year to be able to report a considerable reduction in the cost of all other hospital charges.

The class of men seeking hospital relief, and the probable character of their diseases, account for this. The way in which the Eurasian population is concentrated in Calcutta is another point evident from these figures. It is also noticeable that Hindoos, notwithstanding caste prejudices, accept in-door relief much more readily than Mussulmans, the latter probably relying more on their own system of medicine. 6. It is evident from Statement IV in paragraph 4 that much of the decrease in the rate of mortality, for which the year is remarkable, is due to the decrease of cholera. This is again adverted to in paragraph 7, where a statement is given, which shows that though the improvement has since 1868 been steadily progressive, the death-rate has in 1870 and 1871 been halved and re-halved in the most remarkable manner. It is impossible not to attribute this in a great degree to the free supply of pure water to the town, and the improved drainage of a large section of its area. 7. Intimately connected with this subject is the decrease in the number of ( 3 ) the Medical College Hospital. The number of in-patients (4,395) was less than in 1870 by 131 cases, but the out-door patients had increased by 3,184 to a total of 43,450. The death-rate shows a satisfactory diminution, having fallen from 179.40 per thousand in 1869 to 138.78 in 1870, and 126.28 in the year of review, but is still very high, especially as many moribunds are not admitted. Excluding the cases of 78, put down as moribunds, the death-rate was 106.22 per thousand. Among Christian patients the rate was lower than in any previous year; but the deaths among the female patients this year were relatively as numerous as among the males( 4 ) after every attempt has been made to augment those means, and then to push on rapidly any scheme that may be adopted. 17.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1872. No. 265. FROM J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 31st May 1873. SIR, Medical College Hospital, General Hos- pital, Calcutta Nurses' Institution, Muni- cipal Pauper Hospital, Municipal Police Hospital, Sukeas' Street Dispensary, North Suburban Hospital, Sumbhoo Nath Pun- dit's Hospital, Alipore Dispensary, Aratoon Apcar Dispensary, Howrah General Hos- pital, Calcutta Lock Hospitals. I HAVE the honor to submit the returns and reports of the medical institutions marginally enumerated, for the calen- dar year 1872. I have been obligingly fur- nished by Surgeon N. C. Macnamara, Superin- tendent of the Native Hospital and its affiliated dispensaries, with the returns relating to these institutions. I am thus enabled to include in this report statistics relating to all the public charities situated in Calcutta and its suburbs. Before proceeding to offer any remarks regarding individual institutions which may appear necessary, I shall make a few observations on the combined statistics of all the institutions, as indicating the health of the community during the year under report. Institutions includ- ed in the report.

Of the 105,349 patients, regarding whom particulars of race and caste were registered, 8,313 were Europeans, 9,503 Eurasians, 33,615 Mussulmans, 49,537 Hindoos, and 4,381 belonged to other native castes and classes. These figures give percentages of 7.8, 9.0, 31.9, 47.1, and 4.2. The recent census returns show that the population of Calcutta is composed as follows:4 REPORT ON THE STATEMENT No. IV.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 These figures may appear more curious than useful, and the eleborate analysis to which they have been subjected may seem to be labor wasted; yet they are not devoid of interest as showing the extent to which different sections of the community appreciate the institutions established for their benefit by Government. The extent to which the women and children of the several classes specified resort to hospitals and dispensaries, is perhaps the best indication of the popularity of these institutions. The returns may, in after years, prove useful as indices of the social peculiarities of inhabitants of this part of India, and of the changes which these may in time undergo. As compared with the figures tabulated on the same system in the last year's report, there is a remarkable similarity apparent, which extends to the statistics of individual institutions.

The higher death-rates among native patients are again conspicuous. East Indians occupy an in- termediate position between Europeans and natives. The death-rate of females is lower in all classes than of males, those of children occupying an intermediate position, except among Eura- sians, where therate is higher than either. Table C sup- ports the same conclusions. Table D shows that the death-rates of natives are higher in both the medical and surgical wards, and table G that the same circumstance is apparent on analysing diseases into groups and orders. Cholera, contrary to the experience of past years, has been more fatal among Christians than natives, and so have diarrh12 REPORT ON THE Dr. Smith's report. The report and appended memoranda put Government in possession of clear and complete information on the subject of these funds. Orders have already been issued regarding the disposal of the interest accruing from Prince Golam Mahomed's benefaction and the Hodgson Fund. The interest accruing from the former is equally divided between the Medical College and General Hospitals for the purpose of relieving destitute Christian patients on their discharge from hospital. (Bengal Government letter No. 2049, dated 24th June 1873.) The amount to be given to distressed seamen proceeding to Europe was fixed at Rs. 55-9-4 by Government Order, No. 2237, dated 27th July 1870, and a limit of Rs. 50 fixed in other cases. Special cases in which it is desired to give more, are to be referred to Government. The interest of the Hodgson Fund is to be expended in providing gifts of small sums to destitute native patients on their discharge from hospital. It appears from Dr. Chevers' memorandum that the "Medical College Hospital account" con- sists of a sum collected by Dr. Francis for a similar purpose. It should there- fore also, I think, be held available for the relief of destitute natives on their discharge from hospital. The "Hedger Fund" was bestowed for College purposes, and is about to be expended accordingly. The exclusion of these items reduces the principal and accumulated interest to Rs. 23,372, and the yearly interest available to Rs. 752-1-10. I agree with Dr. Smith in thinking that all the floating deposits and accumulated interest should be invested in Government securities, and perhaps until the question of a new hospital has been finally decided, it will be better to hold these funds in hand. They can be used when the necessity arises for adding to the comfort of the place, or providing such luxuries for the patients as Government cannot be ex- pected to bestow. The sum of Rs. 3,000 advanced by Government, and the savings of previous years, amounting to Rs. 205-14-6, have been paid into the treasury to the credit of Government. Education of mid- wives. 17. Dr. Charles has submitted a report on the subject of training native dhais. Four women remained under instruction when the last report was submitted. Of these three have been examined and certified, and the fourth left of her own accord. Dr. Charles asks whether the experiment is to be continued. My opinion is that it should, if elderly dhais already in practice can be induced to avail themselves of the opportunities offered of improving their knowledge and fitness to practise their calling. 18. The business of this large and important hospital has been during the past year transacted with the zeal and skill, which have always characterized its officers. Dr. Smith also testifies in his report to the assiduity of the resident and subordinate staff. He mentions in a separate communication that the statis- tical portion of the report has been prepared by Assistant Surgeon A. Crombie, M.D., the Resident Surgeon, and I have much pleasure in commending to the notice of Government the clear and intelligent manner in which Dr. Crombie has performed this duty. GENERAL HOSPITAL. 19. Dr. Ewart has again submitted an admirable report of this import- ant hospital, in which medical and administrative matters are treated in a very lucid and exhaustive manner. Addition to the hospital. 20. An important addition was made to the hospital in August, when the building in which the sick of the European regiment stationed at Fort William had been accommodated was vacated by the military. The General Hospital is now a purely civil institution, consisting of three substantial three- storied blocks in which 285 sick can be comfortably treated, or on an emergency as many as 315. The Surgeon Superintendent submitted a well considered
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13 proposal for the increase and re-organization of the hospital establishment in October, which has been sanctioned since the close of the year. This will add materially to the efficiency of the staff. Sundry improvements, enumerated in paragraphs 43 and 44 of the report, have been effected during the year and others are in progress. On the whole the hospital has undergone, during the year, a decided change for the better. Re-organization of hospital estab- lishment. 21. A greater number of sick has been treated than in any of the eight years whose statistics are shown in Dr. Ewart's report. The increase has been mainly due to the prevalence of dengue. The death-rate has been higher than that of 1871, but lower than of any other year of the eight, whether cholera is included or excluded. The greater number of cases of cholera treated accounts to a great extent for the higher death-rate. Cholera contributes fewer deaths to the total mortality however than in of the eight years, 1871 excepted. Statistics. 22. The number of cases of cholera treated in the hospital has been nearly four times as many as in 1871, and has exceeded three years of the remaining six. The rate of mortality has been favorable. In this respect there is a marked contrast with the Medical College Hospital. Dr. Ewart again insists on the advantage of early treatment, and anticipates great benefit from the river side dispensary which is about to be erected. Cholera. 23. I would draw pointed attention to the remarks made on the insanitary state of the river bank. There is evidently great room for improvement, and the information which has already been collected would seem to indicate that much of the sickness to which seamen frequenting this port are liable is due to the polluted state of the river bank, and the unguarded manner in which sewage is conducted into the river. It is satisfactory to find that so very interesting and promising a field of investigation, as the sailors and shipping frequenting the Hooghly, is being worked by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham.

The duties connected with this hospital have been ably and creditably conducted during the year. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. Nurses' Institution. 29. This important institution which supplies nurses to the Medical Col- lege and General Hospitals, continues to pursue its course of usefulness. It has been determined to increase the staff of nurses at the General Hospital. The principal medical officers of both hospitals bear warm testimony to the value of the services rendered by the nurses belonging to this institution. Its funds are in a satisfactory condition. The report of the committee is ap- pended. MUNICIPAL PAUPER HOSPITAL. Class of Cases ad- mitted. STATEMENT NO. XIV. YEARS. Total deaths. DIED WITHIN 24 hours. Per cent. 1 Week. Per cent. 1 Month.

As Dr.Woodford remarks, this hospital is the receptacle for all the sick and dying natives picked up by the police or rejected by other hospitals. Its death-rate, as might be expected, continues terribly high, more than one- fourth of those admitted dying. A special inquiry was made during the year for the purpose of ascertain- ing whether any cause of the excessive mortality of this hospital, not already known, could be discovered, or any measure suggested which might reduce the mortality. No cause could, however, be suggested by either the Deputy Inspector- General of Hospitals, or Superintendent, except the severity of the diseases un- der which the poor famished wretches, who are brought to the hospital, labour, and no improvement recommended, except a slight addition to the staff of attendants, which has since then been approved. The large number of patients dying either on their way to hospital, or immediately or shortly after their arrival there, shows that the death-rate cannot be otherwise than high. Statement No. 14 indicates the number of patients dying within various periods from admis- sion in comparison with past years. Milk 31. The hospital, however, fulfils a most humane and useful purpose, and to judge by the increased attendance of 1872, the shelter and relief that it gives is appreciated. Dr. Woodford points out that the milk supplied by the con- tractor is inferior. If the original contract specified milk of the best quality, the Superintendent should insist on its being supplied, whatever the rate tendered and accepted; if it did not specify the best quality of milk, it should have done so. I have caused him to be written to to this effect. Resident Apothe- cary. 32. I do not support his recommendation, that the Resident Apothecary should be styled House-Surgeon. The former designation is much more appropriate in every way.

Remaining on rolls, 31st December 18 16 REPORT ON THE SOOKEAS' STREET DISPENSARY. Circumstances of original founda- tion. 38. This institution was founded in 1849. Its original purpose was to test the alleged anæsthetic effects of mesmerism, and Surgeon Eisdale, who strongly maintained the efficacy of the practice as a means of procuring painless surgery, was appointed its first Superintendent. During the year under report, the dispensary was under the executive charge of 2nd grade Sub-Assistant Surgeon Money Lall Dutt, L. M. S., and the superintendence of Surgeon W. J. Palmer.

A great number of natives resort to this dispensary for relief, and the figures given in Statement No. 1, as well as those on the margin,show that the number treated was higher than in 1871. The number of surgical operations performed in this dispensary is small, but the accommodation is very limited. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon in his report, extracts from which are given in the Appendix, describes the great prevalance of dengue and of malarious fever towards the close of the year. Finances. 40. The expenses of the hospital amounted to Rs. 6,106, against Rs. 5,535 in 1871. The whole of this money is obtained from Government, and about one-half of it goes to defray the cost of establishment. A small reduction was made during the year in the staff, and pay of compounders, and this was made available for dieting patients. Rs. 403 were expended in dieting patients against Rs. 309 in 1871. Building. 41. The building is about to undergo thorough repairs, and the question of transferring the dispensary to the governors of the Native Hospital was under consideration at the close of the year. NORTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL. Statistics. 42. This hospital is situated in the midst of an important and populous suburb, and has proved, since its establishment in 1866, of great service to the sick and injured poor of the locality. The report of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon in charge, Baboo Luckynarain Bose, gives a full account of the transactions of the hospital during 1872. The attendance has been larger than in 1871. The death-rate continues very high, but is reported to be due to a class of patients to whom it would be gross inhumanity to refuse admission. The Sub-Assis- tant Surgeon has applied the term moribund to patients dying within 48 instead of 24 hours. For the sake of uniformity, the term should have the same application in every hospital. Finances 43. The funds of the institution are in a prosperous state, but the net receipts have fallen from. Rs. 11,087 to Rs. 9,300, the subscriptions of Europeans from Rs. 2,604 to Rs. 1,500, and those of Natives from Rs. 4,372 to Rs. 2,554, as compared with 1871. The institution is however saving money. An out-door depart- ment and new building desir- able. 44. Dr. Saunders points out that there is room for an out-patients' department, and I am decidedly of opinion that the hospital should be made available for the treatment of out-door patients at once. No increase of establishment is necessary for this purpose. The Sub-Assistant Surgeon has already got a native doctor to assist him. I would recommend that Govern- ment should press on the hospital committee, the importance of organizing an out-patients' department. The provision of a new building is also urgently necessary.

It is accommodated in a hired building, which affords room for 25 in-door patients. The Sub-Assist- ant Surgeon resides on the premises, and there are suitable arrangements for a dispensary for out-door patients. It is under the executive charge of Sub- Assistant Surgeon Ram Chunder Sen, and superin- tended by the Civil Surgeon of the 24-Pergunnahs. The report submitted by the for- mer consists mainly of re- ports of cases treated during the year, which, however interesting professionally, are hardly fitted for the pages of an administrative report. It is therefore omitted. The returns of the dispensary are re-produced in the Appendix. The Superintendent's report is also printed. The number of patients treated during 1872 has been considerably in excess of those of the previous year, and indicates that the institution is popular and useful. A goodly number of important surgical operations has been performed with satisfactory success. Attendance of pa- tients. 46. The dispensary is supported partly by Government, which contri- butes the salary of the medical officer in charge, and a special donation of Rs. 100 a month, and partly by funds derived from the interest of a sum of money collected in the year 1871, and from the Suburban Munici- pality. The latter amounted to Rs. 935-4-8. The income was sufficient to meet the wants of the institution. Finances. ALIPORE DISPENSARY. STATEMENT No. XVIII YEAR. IN-DOOR PATIENTS. OUT-DOOR PATIENTS.

This dispensary was established in 1852, and is situated at Alipore close to the jail. It is accommodated in a two-roomed building, which affords room for 12 patients. It is useful for the relief of the poor of this suburb, and the reception and treatment of sick and wounded persons brought by the police. It is under the executive charge of first grade Sub-Assistant Sur- geon Chunder Seekar Hal- dar and the superintendence of the Civil Surgeon of the 24-Pergunnahs. The attend- ance of patients, both in- door and out-door, exceed- ed that of 1871. The number of operations per- formed was trifling. Dengue broke out in this suburb in March, and prevailed till September. Few escaped the disease. 387 cases were treated in the dispensary. Attendance of pa- tients. 48. The dispensary is mainly supported by Government. Subscriptions to the amount of Rs. 225 were obtained from Europeans residing in this suburb, and Rs. 30 from Natives, against Rs. 110 and Rs. 128 in 1871. It has always been found difficult to obtain voluntary contributions in behalf of this dispensary. Finances. E

It was established in 1870 by Mr. Thomas Apcar, and is mainly supported by him. Other residents of the suburb contribute about 25 Rs. monthly. Mr. Apcar built a suitable house for the dispensary in his own compound, and takes a great interest in the charity. Government gives a supply of medicines gratis. 8,402 persons obtained relief in this dispensary, against 8,305 in 1871. Den- gue broke out at Garden Reach in April. 226 cases were treated at the dispensary. Five cases of cholera were treated, all of which came from the suburb. The dispensary is under the charge of native doctor Prankisto Mookerjee, who gives satisfaction. THE HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 'Moribunds." 50. Surgeon J. Elliot, M.D., Civil Surgeon of Howrah, has submitted a most interesting report of this hospital, which details the transaction of the year in a clear and exhaustive manner. I observe that it has been the practice to exclude "moribund" patients altogether from the returns, and the term as hitherto employed has been indefinite. Dr. Elliot still excluding this class of cases from the returns of the hospital, gives a separate classified return of them, and limits the term to patients dying within 24 hours, in accordance with the practice of other hospitals. On adding the 149 moribund cases admitted to the 142 deaths shown in the returns, the death-rate is raised from 119.9 to 218.5 per 1,000. A comparison with past years is im- possible, because, even were the number of moribund cases known, they might not, under different medical officers with different views as to what constitutes a "moribund" case, embrace the same class of patients. I am clearly of opinion, as I have already stated, that the statistics of a hospital ought to embrace all cases admitted alive, whatever their condition; and that statements excluding "moribunds" should be separate and special. I have caused the superintendent of the hospital to be addressed in the above sense. Abuses discovered, and remedied. Finances. 51. Dr. Elliot details in his report the various abuses which he discovered among the subordinates of the hospital, and the changes and economies which he has effected; in all this he was warmly and ably seconded by Mr. Saunders, the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, and fully supported by the hospital committee. I consider that these officers deserve great credit for the promp- titude and success with which they addressed themselves to remedy the malpractices which came to light, and to reduce an overgrown and overpaid establishment without impairing the efficiency of the institution. Dr. Elliot's further proposals for the improvement of the hospital will no doubt be favour- ably considered by the committee. It is satisfactory to note that the financial state of the institution is at present good; but its sources of income are some- what precarious, and its continuous solvency and efficient working will always be a subject of anxiety to the superintendent and committee. CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. Reductions. Control transferred to the medical department. 52. These hospitals have now been reduced to twoCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 they are administered with as rigid an economy as is consistent with efficiency. It is satisfactory to note that the expenses connected with the medical examin- ation and treatment of prostitutes under Act XIV have, in 1872, undergone a very considerable reduction, as compared with the two preceding years.

Dr. Shircore, the Officiating Superintendent of these hospitals, gives in his report for the year 1872 full details regarding their working. The state- ment on the margin shows that though the amount of disease detected among regis- tered prostitutes is greater than in 1871, for the rea- son assigned by the Superin- tendent, it falls considerably short of the two first years of the operation of the Act; while from the table given in paragraph 7, it is quite evi- dent that the severer forms of venereal affection which entail the graver secondary and hereditary results have undergone a very marked and satisfactory reduction. This is a matter of great importance, and there need be no hesitation in accepting the figures. The contrast between the amount of disease among the women subjected to regular medical examination, and those brought for examination for the first time, shows how much the proceedings carried out under the Act tend to limit the prevalence of the loathsome and serious diseases which it is their object to combat. Reduction of dis- ease among pros- titues. 54. The statistics of the European regiment in the fort evidence a decided decrease of venereal affections. I am of opinion, however, that for purposes of com- parison with the period before the introduction of the Act, all cases of venereal disease occurring in the garrison should be shown. That which has been con- tracted within the limits of the operation of the Act can be exhibited as a special statement. The statistics of hospitals show that venereal disease is still under- going a diminution among the general community. In the month of June 1872, I submitted, for the information of Government, the opinions of the medical officers holding hospital charges in Calcutta on this subject. They bore strong testimony to the benefit which Act XIV of 1868 is conferring on the health of Calcutta. Statistics of the garrison of Fort Williams; and of hospitals. 55. I append a memorandum showing the dates on which the several reports and returns, treated of in the above, were received in this office. Several references regarding these became necessary, the last of which was only received on the 24th of this month. There has, therefore, been no unnecessary delay in this office; and the delay which has taken place has enabled me to avail myself of the returns of the Chandney Hospital, and its affiliated dispensaries, and of those of the Health Officer of Calcutta, which have materially assisted me in drawing conclusions regarding the health of the town from the statistics of the Calcutta Medical Institutions.

Of the above in-patients, 2,198 were Christians. Under this head are included Europeans and Indo-Europeans or Eurasians. Of these 125 died, or 56.7 per thousand. The number is 426 in excess of the preceding year; and the death-rate is also greater by 0.9 per thousand; that for 1871 being 55.86 per thousand. Death-rate of Christian pa- tients. Of these 125 deaths, 25 occurred within 24 hours of admission. If these were excluded, the death-rate would be 46.01 per thousand of cases treated. But only 2,106 of the above number were treated to a termination. Of these, 59.3 per thousand died; but, excluding moribund cases, the death-rate of these cases is only 47.4 per thousand amongst Christians. The corresponding numbers for the previous year were 59.2 and 49.0, respectively. The mortality amongst Christian inmates of this hospital was 65.3 in 1870, 78.9 in 1869, 87.3 in 1868, and 67.39 in 1867. In the preceding fifteen years the rate was 95.52 per thousand. The number of native in-patients was 2,430, being 314 in excess of the preceding year. Of this number 410 died, or 168.7 per thousand. The corres- ponding number was, in 1871, 185.2; in 1870, 198.2; in 1869, 253.4; and in 1868, 255.94; and for the past 15 years, 235.5. Death-rate of Na- tive patients. Of the above number of native patients, 89 were moribund on admission, and died within 24 hours. Deducting these, the rate of mortality is only 136.6. But of the total number, only 2,284 were treated to a termination, giving a mortality of 179.5 per thousand, or, on deducting the moribund cases, 146.2 per thousand, as the result of treatment in hospital. With regard to the rate of mortality, it is necessary to state that only cases dying within 24 hours are returned as moribund on admission; but, besides these, many patients, especially natives, are admitted in the most advanced stages of organic disease of vital organs; and though they linger for four, seven, or ten days, they are hopeless from the first, and in reality only come into hospital to die. It is impossible to eliminate these cases in a general return, but the fact is one to be remembered in estimating the causes of the higher rate of mortality amongst natives in this hospital. Definition of "moribund." The following tabular statement of the rate of mortality per thousand of the decade is of great interest, as showing the great diminution this has undergone of late years, amongst both christians and natives treated in this hospital. The total number of cases treated, as well as the number of moribund cases admitted, during each of the last ten years, are given, in order to show that this decrease is not due to an increased popularity of the institution, and a consequent admission on that account of a larger number of cases of a milder type, and therefore more amenable to treatment, but that other causes must be sought. It is to be observed that the most marked, and an increasing, diminu- tion in mortality has taken place during the last three years of the series, corresponding with the introduction of the municipal water-supply to Calcutta in point of time. This coincidence would seem to point towards the conclusion that the habitual use of pure water has lessened generally the gravity and fatality of the diseases of the class of people from which the patients of this hospital are derived. It will also be shown that the number of admissions for cholera (though not the mortality of the cases), and the deaths by pyæmia after operation, have also been diminished during the same period. Mortality rates during the last decade.

He was then appointed Resident Physician to the hospital, and Professor of Pathology in the College, which appointment he has held ever since. From 7th March up till 9th Decem- ber 1872, Dr. R. H. Stevens acted as Resident Surgeon of the hospital. From 10th December 1872 till 24th January 1873, Dr. C. H. Joubert officiated as Resident Surgeon. These officers performed their arduous duties with great zeal. I regret to say that Dr. Stevens was obliged to leave India on 18 months' sick leave. Important duties performed by the resident staff. The comparatively recent appointment of the resident Hospital officers has proved a highly satisfactory arrangement. A great part of the daily routine work of the hospital has been conducted, or supervised, by these officers with, the utmost care and efficiency. They personally superintend the working of the out-door medical and surgical dispensaries; they assist the physicians and surgeons of the hospital in all cases of difficulty; and one of them is always present on duty for the reception and immediate treatment of all dangerous cases, such as result from railway accidents, poisoning, suicide, &c., &c. I beg to be permitted to say that I consider the thanks of Government might fairly be accorded to these officers for the very careful manner in which they have at all times done their work.

Hospital and col- lege funds. A special report regarding the hospital and college funds is now being prepared, and will shortly be submitted. With reference to paragraph 14 of the Government resolution on the annual report of last year, I beg to point out that there is not a lac of rupees, or anything like it, at the disposal of the principal of this college, the returns from which the Government believes to have been spent upon "miscellaneous objects without check or control." The truth is, that the sum of Rs. 76,866-8-8 (representing the Prince "Gholam Mahomed" Fund) is invested in Govern- ment paper, and is only drawn upon strictly in accordance with the orders laid down by the Government. The same also applies to the "Hodgson Fund," which (exclusive of interest) amounts to a sum of Rs. 4,306-6-10. Thus it will be seen that of the sum of upwards of a lac of rupees, alluded to by the Go- vernment, Rs. 81,172-15-6 are securely invested, and expended with perfect regularity. The "Hedger Fund," amounting (exclusive of interests) to Rs. 3,439-2-0, was made over for college purposes. Suggestions regarding its ex- penditure will be separately submitted to the Government. The other hospital funds are the following, yielding a total sum of Rs. 26,096-10 6:MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 35 The annual interest of the above sums amounts to Rs. 839-0-4, as shown below:36 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. saving thereby effected, is entirely due to Mr. Bowser, who deserves much praise for the manner in which he planned and executed these arrangements. Minor improve- ments. Other minor improvements have been sanctioned by the Government. Amongst these may be mentioned the supply of fire-hose and fittings (at a cost of Rs. 372); a steam-boiler for the disinfection of beds, and the destruc- tion of vermin, &c. Requirements. Pending the decision of Government regarding a new hospital, it may be stated that the following additions and improvements are much needed:MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 37 No. 70.

The following remarks are submitted in explanation of questions raised in the Inspector-General's letter, paragraph 20, pagel4, and paragraph 14 of the Government resolution, page 3, printed in the "Report of the Calcutta medical institutions for the year 1871," which has reached me to day.

N. C. Any data which are wanting may be supplied from the Office, and by reference, if necessary, to Mr. Partridge and to Drs. Eatwell, Francis, and Ewart, during the time of whose administration of the Principalship the sums noted in the margin were received, and the various expenditures in ques- tion from the "Hedger," "Fagan," "Elias," and "Wise" Funds, were made.* Previous expendi- ture duly autho- rized.

It will be observed that about one-half of this sum (Rs. 11,000), being the Maharjah of Ulwar and Gopaul Lall Tagore's benefactions, only became avail- able in the year 1870. A demi-official correspondence, which took place between the late Lieute- nant-Governor, Sir W. Grey, and myself, is evidence of the fact that the appro- priate expenditure upon the hospital of a small sum of this kind is by no means so plain and easy a matter as might at first sight appear. Kajah Abdool Ghani of Dacca having bestowed the sum of rupees eight thousand upon the hospi- tal, His Honor desired me to suggest the proper manner of expending this gift. I very strongly urged the need for either a porter's lodge, or a place for the re- ception of noisy patients, the least expensive of the public works, for which Government grants had been solicited, without success, up to the date of my last annual report. His Honor objected to these modes of expending the money which, under instructions, was alienated from the hospital, and devoted to a useful purpose in the college. Under these circumstances, I have considered that, while the question of abandoning the hospital is pending, I should exceed my duty in searching out some, by no means urgently needful, object for the expenditure of this small, but, while it remains unbroken, always satisfactory reserve fund, which stands ready to meet some sudden emergency or some great want, such as that of fire escapes, of which, in consequence of the unusual height of the building, I have for years sought in vain for plans and estimates.

42 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Report on the in- struction of na- tive dhais To.MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 43 In Dr. Smith's letter some of the more prominent facts are alluded to, and these are dwelt on more prominently in the report. Amongst these the lessened rate of mortality both as regards European and Native patients, and the marked decrease of mortality from sceptic diseases generally, is satisfactory. It is an- ticipated that from the draining of that part of the town, and by adaptations in the hospital building and arrangements, further improvements in this direction may be effected. Amongst others, the supply of water direct from the Municipal water-works, will add to the comfort and benefit of the sick. This has been sanctioned. 3. Although, in a sanitary point of view, the placing a hospital in the midst of a town is objectionable, yet there are so many circumstances with reference to the patients, and affording the medical assistance for which such an institu- tion is intended, that other reasons besides purely professional ones, and in some instances theoretical ones, have to be considered, and the last three years show what we are entitled to regard as a fair improvement in the hygienic conditions of the Medical College Hospital. 4. The undersigned begs to corroborate Dr. Smith's report of the well- merited praise of the hospital staff, and, from his personal observation, to record the minute care and attention paid to the details of the hospital adminis- tration.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL, CALCUTTA. FOR THE YEAR 1872. Average Daily Sick. Average daily sick during the years 1865-72. The average daily sick during the eight years ending 1872 has been as follows:GENERAL HOSPITAL. 69 The mortality during the past has exceeded that of the previous year by 8.78 in the thousand, but with this exception, it is lower than that of any of the other years included in the above statement; whilst it is 18.16 in the thousand below the average of the seven years ending 1871. Comparision of 1872 with previous years. 4. The concluding figures of the subjoined statement, from which all cholera cases have been excluded, shew that the largest part of the increase of mortality over that which prevailed during the previous year, was attri- butable to the greater frequency of, and mortality from, cholera:-70 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS, Principal causes of death during the years 1865GENERAL HOSPITAL. 71 ST.72 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Water is probably not the only means of cholera diffusion. may probably be through the medium of an impure supply of water: but I am also constrained to believe that this is is not the only mode by any means, and that, especially in its epidemic form, it can diffuse itself among mankind through almost any conceivable article of food, and that it probably, in the majority of instances, gains access to the system through the atmosphere breathed in respiration. But the whole subject of the mode or modes by which cholera is engendered and propagated is involved in such obscurity, that it is even now hazardous to venture any fixed opinion upon it. Mortality of cho- lera, depends greatly on the stage at which treatment is commenced. 10. The mortality to treated has fluctuated considerably, from 721.3 in 1869 to 446.8 in the thousand in 1872, which is only 13.9 less than it was in 1865. After many years of close attention to this important question, my conclusion is, that no particular plan of treatment has much real effect over the disease when it has fairly passed into the stage of collapse; but that much good can be accomplished during the earlier career of the malady, I am as positively convinced as I am of any principle of medical science. We have received a slightly greater number of cases during the preliminary stage than we did in previous years, and it is to this, rather than to any innovation in the treatment employed, that I attribute the decrement in the mortality to cases admitted. Anticipated benefit from a river side dispensary. 11. When the river side dispensary, the erection of which has been sanc- tioned by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, on a spot near Prinsep's Ghât, fixed upon by Mr. James Crawford, Collector of Customs, and myself, is com- pleted, I anticipate a still further reduction in the mortality to treated, inas- much as the patients will be received there, and placed under immediate thera- peutical management at a much earlier period than they can possibly be under the present haphazard arrangements. This dispensary will be placed under the charge of the authorities of the General Hospital, who will arrange to have the patients detained during the heat of the day, and removed by dhoolee or ambulance to the hospital in the cool of the morning or evening. It is also in every way probable that the benefits thus anticipated in regard to cholera will be extended to other serious cases of disease. The sanitary con- dition of the river bank de- mands attention. 12. But I still think that no efforts should be relaxed in endeavouring to amend the sanitary condition of the river bank. It is in a very insanitary condition at those points where the old sewers, with their open and untrapped mouths, are reeking with most offensive exhalations. I would suggest that means be adopted to have these carefully trapped, so that the emanations pro- ceeding from them may be mitigated, or prevented to the greatest extent possible. It has long been noted that ships moored in the vicinity of these sewer openings have been very liable to become infected with cholera. 13. This point has been looked into by Dr. Lewis, special Officer for the investigation of cholera, who has rendered me valuable assistance in the management of the cholera cases in hospital. 14. Drs. Lewis and Cunningham are resident at the hospital, and see and prescribe for every case immediately on admission, conducting it through- out under my supervision; and thus, having a direct interest in the result of the cases, they have been most energetic in investigating the localities from which our supply of cholera cases is derived. Without committing themselves to any final opinion regarding the generation and diffusion of the disease, I am authorized to say that they have been much struck with the remarkably insanitary state of those portions of the river bank from which the greatest number of cases have been sent to hospital.
73 GENERAL HOSPITAL. 15. The following statement shows the position in the port and town from which the cholera cases treated during 1872 have been derived:74 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Advantage of early treatment. quinine, becomes a most appalling disease when extensive sloughing has taken place, or when, as not unfrequently happens, it becomes complicated with abscess of the liver. Nearly all the cases which prove mortal have passed through one or other of these conditions, or both, long before the patients have sought for admission into hospital." The results of the year under review form no exception to the rule. But, considering the general unhealthiness of the year, the mortality has nevertheless been very low for this malady. In hospital practice a death-rate to treated of 42.55 in the thousand is exception- ally favorable. It would be lower even than this if cases were admitted earlier, or before destructive ulceration of the mucous membrane had advanced to such an extent as to render therapeutical management rather palliative than curative in its effects. As with cholera, so with this disease, it is reasonably expected that one of the many benefits anticipated from the establishment of a well-ordered and well-managed river-side dispensary will be a palpable reduction of the death-rate. For it may be fairly expected that, as these cases will be brought earlier under the influence of our sovereign remedyGENERAL HOSPITAL. 75 4TH.76 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. A special inquiry regarding Re- mittent fever desirable. These remittents account for a death-rate of 263.1 in the thousand cases treated, for 1.4 to total cases, and for 32.0 of the deaths to total deaths from all causes. I propose having a careful registry kept of all the cases of this kind in future, with a view to test how many of the so-called remittents are typhus, typhoid, or relapsing fevers, and submit the first series of results in my next annual report. This will entail much labor and close investigation. For cholera, two officers are now investigating that subject with nothing else to do. Considering, therefore, the vast importance of the subject of these fevers, I trust the Inspector-General will be pleased to place an officer at my disposal temporarily, to assist me in carrying out this important project. I believe the results of such an investigation will much more than repay the slight outlay that will thus be involved. 6TH.GENERAL HOSPITAL. 77 This is not a common form of disease, but it is a steady contributor to the mortality of the hospital. During the year the ratio of deaths to treated was 571.4 in the thousand; of the total deaths, 25 in the thousand were accounted for by this disease. 8TH.78 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Sickness and mor- tality among men, women, and children. 26.

If all patients who died within six hours after admission were reckoned as moribunds, the ordinary death-rate would have been 40.57 per mille during 1872, instead of 43.30. If, however, the rule were to be extended to those who died within twelve hours, then the mortality to treated during 1872 would be 36.35 per mille. I think the same practice which has been sanctioned at the College with reference to moribunds should be introduced into the General Hospital, and I hope the Inspector-General will be pleased to authorize me to make the change in next year's report. SURGERY. Surgical opera- tions. 30. Seven cases remained over from last year, and ten new cases for operation have been admitted, making a total of seventeen treated during the year. The cases have all done well, and uphold the remarks which I made last year relative to the freedom of the hospital from septicæmic diseases The question of setting apart the small demi-upper roomed building formerly occupied by the sick women and children of European troops garrisoning Fort William, for native surgical sick, has already been formally submitted for the approbation and sanction of Government. As the transfer to the Surgeon of the General Hospital of the accommodation vacated on the 14th August 1872 by the military authorities has removed the difficulty of finding suitable espace for the reception and management of native surgical cases, I trust this proposal will soon meet with the favorable decision of Government. MIDWIFERY. Midwifery 31. There have been sixteen deliveries during the past, and one remained over from last year. The whole of these cases Cave done well. To this list must be added four cases of abortion, which have been also treated with suc- cess. There has not been. a trace of septicæmic or other conditions of blood poisoning to which the puerperal state renders the lying-in-woman more than usually liable, in any of these cases. DIETING. Dieting. 32. This has been carried on as satisfactorily as it can be, until the covered trays are provided. The pattern selected turned out to be too unwieldy. A lighter one has now been chosen. When ready, one good, substantial tray will be available for each of the three divisions of the hospital. These, together with an additional cooking store which has been sanctioned, and an improved
GENERAL HOSPITAL. 81 and somewhat decentralized constitution of the establishment of cooks and khitmutgars when supplied, will bring this important department up to a standard of the greatest perfection attainable. SANITARY. 33. It has been resolved, after much consideration by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, for the present not to introduce the water closet system into the hospital. In lieu of this and the plan now in operation, it has been decided to maintain the dry system within the hospital, and to combine it with the water-carriage system of the Calcutta municipality as follows:82 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. of the Government order is to submit an indent on Her Majesty's Secretary of State. I am of opinion, however, that on representation, an exception may fairly be made in favor of a great charity like the General Hospital, which ministers so much to the alleviation and cure of the diseases from which the mercantile marine suffer within its walls. I trust the Inspector-General will be pleased to move His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor to sanction the continu- ance of the practice of buying cheap literature from any of the reading clubs for the library. 38. The Editors of the Englishman and Daily News continue to supply their respective newspapers to the hospital, gratis. The Bengal Club have regu- larly furnished the papers of the previous day. Mr. Pirrie Duff has kindly favored us with the Scotsman. NURSING. Nursing. 39. In a letter dated 24th December, to Mrs. Colquhoun Grant, the Honorary Secretary of the Committee of the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Insti- tution, I wrote in the following terms regarding the nurses: " I have much pleasure in again bearing testimony to the very creditable manner in which the nurses attached to the Presidency General Hospital performed their arduous and highly responsible duties during the past twelve months. It is difficult to estimate the important services rendered to the sick by these women. So much am I impressed with the value of their services, that I should most gladly welcome an increase to the number of nurses at present allotted to the hospital. During the past year the whole of the buildings, formerly occupied by the Native and European sick in Fort William, have been available for the general purpose of the hospital. Whilst this has given more space, it has entailed a marked increment to the average number of daily sick. To meet the necessities of this increase of the patients in hospital, we ought, to begin with, to be furnished with at least two more nurses in addition to the present staff of ten nurses and one matron." During the greater part of the year, Mrs. Atlay performed the duty of Honorary Secretary to the Committee. She has lately been ably substituted by Mrs. Grant, who has taken a most active interest in the management of the nurses. In this good work Mrs. Grant has been admir- ably assisted by the matron, Mrs. Hickey. COVENANTED EXECUTIVE ESTABLISHMENT. New organization of the hospital. 40. I have been much indebted for the harmonious and smooth working of the institution to my able assistants, Dr. W. J. Palmer and Dr. S. Coull Mackenzie. The increased accommodation, consequent on the transfer of the building from the military authorities to the surgeon of the hospital, has enabled me to dis- tribute the work, and to effect an amount of decentralization previously im- practicable, so that now each officer has charge of his complement of patients in an entirely separate and distinct building of his own, subject to the control and supervision of the surgeon-superintendent. But to render this decentra- lization efficient, an augmentation of the establishment is needed. I trust the scheme transmitted on 21st October 1872, may meet with the support of the Inspector-General and the speedy sanction of Government, inasmuch as at present everything is carried on at a rate of high pressure, which it will not be possible to sustain permanently. Dr. S. C. Macken- zie's services. 41. I consider it but due to Dr. S. Coull Mackenzie to take this opportu- nity of bringing his excellent services to the notice of the Inspector-General. Though he found his wards, on occupying them, with bare walls, and in a rather filthy condition, he had not been in possession long before they were put into the best order possible under the circumstances then existing. To
GENERAL HOSPITAL. 83 make the place more inviting and cheerful, pictures have been put up in various places, and evergreens plentifully supplied for the verandahs. He has also rendered me substantial aid in obtaining pictures and evergreens for my own wards and verandahs, and in planting fruit trees, flowers, and shrubs in the hospital compound. SUBORDINATE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT. Senior Apothecary L. Estrange, the steward of the hospital, has fully sustained his reputation in conducting his arduous duties to my entire satis- faction. Subordinates. IMPROVEMENTS. 42. The hospital has now been provided with lockers for the sick, so that the food, medicine, and small articles of clothing, &c., belonging to each patient, can be stored away without difficulty. This is a marked improvement upon the old plan, of having open shelves, adding much to the convenience and com- fort of the patients, and to the general orderly appearance of the wards. Wire netting and chicks have been supplied to the verandahs of the central block and the western wing. These appliances are useful in keeping out the crows, &c., and in cooling the wards during the heat of the day in the hot months of the year. Head rests have also been provided for the bed-ridden cases, enabling us to contribute materially to the comfort of these helpless patients. For these improvements I am mainly indebted to Lady Napier, who, during her short stay in Calcutta, repeatedly visited the hospital, and took a warm interest in the wel- fare of the institution and its inmates. Improvements. 44. Gas has been laid throughout the wards of the eastern wing. I am now engaged in arranging for a substantial Portland cement flooring in all the wards, similar in pattern and quality to that which has been used in some of the floors of the mint. Colonel Hyde, Master of the mint, has kindly allowed Mr. Sills to lend me all the assistance in his power, with a view to the accom- plishment of this object. VISITORS. 45. The hospital has been visited by Lord and Lady Napier of Merchistoun and Lord Napier of Magdala; The Honorable George Campbell, Lieutenant- Governor of Bengal; Dr. Campbell Brown, C. B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, and Mr. George Saunders, the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals. Visitors. JOSEPH EWART, M.D., Surgeon, General Hospital.

THE Committee of the above institution, in placing before the public the report of the thirteenth year of its existence, have to deplore a falling off in the donations and monthly subscriptions. But, although the funds are so low, the Committee have determined on giving two additional nurses to the General Hospital, as the work cannot be done efficiently without them. One is to be placed in the female ward, the other in the building lately occupied by the sick from Fort William. Two additional nurses to be given to the General Hospital. The Committee have much satisfaction in being able to show from the following testimony of Dr. Ewart and of Dr. D. B. Smith, the efficiency and worth of the nurses belonging to this institution. The Surgeon-Superintendent of the General Hospital, Dr. Ewart, in a letter to the Honorary Secretary of the Committee, says:92 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

Increase of average sick. The death-rate has been 202 in 1,000, or, inclusive of those who were received in a dying state, 277 per 1,000; this death-rate is the same as that of 1869 and 1871, which were the lowest rates attained, as may be seen by reference to Appendix A. Death-rate. Mortality.94 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Voluntary appli- cants for admis- sion. The third class, or those who are admitted on their own or their friends' application, makes up the remaining one-fourth of the admissions; in it, is included children from charitable asylums, and coolies from emigration depôts, from which are numbered our chief hopeful cases. The hygienic state of the hospital good. That the hospital itself affords every chance for rcovery, is sufficiently proved by the fact that the mortality is now fourteen per cent. lower than when the sick were located in the premises adjoining the Gowkhannah; and if further proof be wanted, it is only necessary to instance the recoveries of those police chowkidars who have been transferred from the Police Hospital with phage- dPAUPER HOSPITAL. 95 and when the size of the building is taken into consideration, it will be seen how impossible it is for one door-keeper to guard a hospital that is open, and has public thoroughfares on each and every side.

During the current year it is to be hoped they will be removed, and jilmill doors substituted at the south end of each ward in place of the present open brick-work doorways, which obstruct free ventilation. It is absolutely necessary to open out the hospital as much as possible to the south and east, to counteract the noxious emanations from the native houses and latrines which form the north and west boundary of the hospital premises. Nothing can well be more unfortunate than the hospital site, or faulty than the building itself, as edibles of the worst description continue to be passed under the railings from the main road or street, such as gram and chillies, in spite of the utmost vigilance of the guard on duty: some cases of death from dysentery and fever were traced to that cause alone. Many fever cases have been attacked by dysentery while in hospital, and vice versâ; sores and ulcers have often taken on a sloughing form, necessitating their transfer to the Muni- cipal Pauper Hospital, which is also under the same superintendence, where they for the most part rapidly recover, proving that the air of the Police Chowkedar Hospital is vitiated by the surroundings on the north and western boundaries. Much is being done to improve the defects, efficient drainage is being carried out, three detached latrines with a supply of water has been estimated for, as also stand-posts for drinking and bathing purposes, all of which must prove of great convenience if they do not shorten the duration of disease and lessen the mortality. Time will show; but it is to be feared that no great reduction in the death-rate can take place so long as the adjoining buildings empty their refuse into the hospital compound. The wards of the hospital would be much improved by the substitution of iron pillars, as recommended in previous annual reports, in place of the present heat radiating brick pillars. Defects.

112 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. REPORT OF THE NORTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL. Date of establish- ment. The hospital was established in September 1866 for the reception of in-door patients only, and has been in existence for the last six years and four months. Amount of accom- modation avail- able. 2. It ordinarily provides 36 beds only, but during the last year, from July to December, when sickness was unusually prevalent, extra accommodation was provided for patients brought to the hospital with serious and urgent symptoms, to prevent their dying on the way if removed to Calcutta hospitals. The total number of beds never exceeded 45 at a time, for fear of overcrowding. Building. The hospital is located in a house, situated on the Cossipore Road, close to the Government Gun Foundry, for which a rent of Rs. 60 is paid per month. The patients are accommodated in a large commodious shed, which is open on the south, and is supplied by a masonry wall, having openings for ventilation on the other sides. It has canvas purdahs on the south which protects it from the sun and rain. The roof is thatched, and the floor is nearly on a level with premises. The shed being unsuitable for the purposes of a hospital, the committee of management are endeavoring their utmost to build a suitable house. A site for the building has been obtained at Borana- gore as a free gift from Babu Chunder Coomar Roy and his co-sharers of the Narail estate. I believe the erection of the building will soon commence. There is a one-storied house in the hospital compound, which not being adapted for the purposes of a hospital, is occupied by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, his office and dispensary. Finances. The finances of the hospital are managed by a committee of influential Native and European gentlemen, the Magistrate of the 24-Pergunnahs being the ex-officio president. The Government contributes the pay of the medical officer and the cost of Europe medicines and surgical instruments. On the recommendation of the Deputy-Inspector General of Hospitals, a more liberal diet scale was adopted in September last. This has consider- ably increased the expenditure. The increased expenditure is partially met from the savings in the cost of the sanctioned establishment. The financial position of the hospital is satisfactory. The balance at the end of the year 1871 was Rs. 16,683-3-4, which, added to the subscriptions, donations realized, and interest of invested funds, aggregate Rs. 24,182-11-1. The total expenditure was Rs. 4,554-9-3. The balance available on the 1st January 1873 was Rs. 19,628-1-10: of this sum Rs. 17,882-1-6 is invested in municipal debentures. The pay of the medical officer and the cost of Europe medicines received as contributions from the Government are shown in the accompanying returns, but not included in the totals given above. Number of patients treated. The total number of sick treated during the year under report was 726 against 749 of the previous year. Of this number 317 were discharged cured, 99 had partial relief, 34 were no better, 191 died, and 35 remained under treatment on the 1st of January 1873. The daily average number of sick treated was 35.178 against 36 of the previous year. Mortality. The percentage of mortality among the sick treated during the year was 26 per cent. against 24 per cent. of the previous year. This high death-rate was owing to the large number of low cases of diarrhNORTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL. 113 and dysentery admitted into the hospital in an advanced state of the disease, and they had been generally so ill-fed and emaciated that they might be said to have passed all human remedy. But the North Suburban Hospital being a pauper hospital, I had no option but to admit them. Leaving out of calculation the moribund cases which were 40 in number, and which proved fatal within 48 hours after admission into the hospital, the mortality was 20 per cent. The deaths from cholera have not been included among these moribund cases. The total number of capital operations performed was nine. All of these made good recoveries. This speaks well of the cleanliness enjoined at the hospital. Operations. The last year was unusually unhealthy. Dengue made its appearance in the beginning of the year. A few cases of it only were observed at first, in December 1871; but during the months of April, May, and June, it raged as an epidemic, after which period it gradually disappeared, leaving no trace what- ever of its existence by the beginning of September. The hospital establish- ment along with the residents suffered from the disease. As cases of dengue recovered without medical aid, or medicines, very few persons suffering from that disease resorted to the hospital. Dengue. Along with dengue, a type of low remittent fever also prevailed in this part of the suburbs. The cases of remittent fever were very common from June to December. The disease was marked by early prostration, and delirium114 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

REPORT ON THE SUMBHOO NAUTH PUNDIT HOSPITAL. Bhowanipore, otherwise called the Sumbhoo Nauth Pundit Hospital, after, a High Court Native Judge, now deceased, was originally a Government insti- tution, and all expenses incurred on its account were met from the Govern- ment treasury. It received the name of the Sumbhoo Nauth Pundit Hospital in 1871, which was given to it in the hope that the executors of the will of the late distinguished Judge would endow it. This hope, however, was disappointed. In the same year, 1871, about eleven thousand rupees were collected by private subscriptions, and a portion of this has been invested in Government paper, yielding an income of a sum total of 45 rupees a month. A number of gentlemen promised to subscribe monthly as soon as the hospital had received its new name; but these subscriptions, for some reason unexplained, have not yet been collected. On the subject of getting public aid to the institution, the Government of Bengal writes; (see letter No. 3833, from Officiating Under- Secretary, dated 28th August 1872). "His Honor thinks that as the value of the dispensary, and the benefit it confers, should after the lapse of so many years be well and widely known. It is time local officers, the committee, and those who take an interest in the success and continuance of the institution, should make a vigorous effort to raise subscriptions and make it more self- supporting ..................At any rate His Honor has decided that the continu- ance of the money grant of Rs. 100 a month shall depend on whether a proper subscription is raised to show that the institution is really required and appreciated." At present the financial condition of the hospita lis being thoroughly reviewed; and I believe that, as recommended by the Government, a vigorous effort will soon be made to raise subscriptions. The present income and resources are derived as follows:SUMBHOO NAUTH PUNDIT HOSPITAL. 119 Annual Return of Out and In-Patients at the Sumbhoonath Pundit Hospital, Bhowanipore, for the year 1872. [N.

This officer has been attached to the dispensary since it was opened in 1852. He is intelligent, industrious, and much esteemed, by the poor who frequent the dispensary. He is also invaluable in aiding the civil surgeon in his official correspondence; moreover when the civil sur- geon is out on duty in the district, the sub-assistant surgeon takes charge of his office and answers any call which may be made on him by the courts. His registers are written up to date, his instruments clean, and the poisons sepa- rated from the other medicines.

132 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. REPORT ON THE ARATOON APCAR DISPENSARY. For the year 1872. THIS dispensary was established in December 1870, mainly, I am told, through the influence and aid of Mr. Thomas Apcar, at Garden Reach. The dispensary building appears to have been at one time the gate-house to Mr. Apcar's compound. It is clean and comfortably fitted up, and though small, is sufficient for the purpose.

136 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1872. Superintendence. I TOOK charge of the hospital on 5th April 1872 from Dr. D. B. Smith, who had been appointed Officiating Principal, Calcutta Medical College. The working of the institution has not been altogether satisfactory for reasons that I shall hereafter refer to in the report. Average daily sick. Average daily sick during 1864-72. The average of daily sick during the nine years ending 1872 has been as follows:HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 137 It will be observed that during 1872 the number of in-door admissions for treatment in the european department has slightly exceeded that of the year 1871, yet it is below the average of the eight preceding years. Number of Euro- peans treated, in- door. The death-rate among european in-door cases has, however, decreased, for while during the eight years preceding 1872, the average ratio per thousand of deaths to treated was 65.20, it has during the year under report only reached to 46.90, showing a decrease in the latter over the former years of 18.30 per thousand of cases treated. Death-rates. There appears to have been an increase in the number of deaths to treated among native in-door cases, for during the eight years preceding the present, the average ratio per thousand of deaths to treated only amounted to 144.98; whereas during 1872 it has reached to 194.52; the latter exceeding the average of the former to the extent of 49.54 per thousand of cases treated. Death-rate among Natives. It is difficult to make a fair comparison of the annual increase or decrease of death-rate in this department without being perfectly certain as to the meaning attached to the term "moribund," and without ascertaining the nature of the cases which were excluded from the returns under this head during former years. To facilitate in future the submission of a reliable statement, I have ordered a separate list of "moribunds" to be kept from the commencement of the present year, limiting the term to those who die within 24 hours after admission. "Moribunds. The number of Europeans who obtained out-door relief at the dispensary more than doubled the admissions of the year immediately preceding, and has exceeded the average of most previous years, with the exception of 1865. The increase of attendance during 1872 may be attributed to the prevalence of dengue in the station and suburbs. Europeans treated, out-door. The percentage of deaths to treated cannot be correctly given, as the actual mortality among out-patients is not known. The number of native patients who obtained out-door relief has fallen off during 1872. The daily attendance was less than during any previous year with the exception of 1867, which appears to have been exceptionally healthy. I am unable to account satisfactorily for the falling off in attendance in this depart- ment during the past year, as dengue was equally prevalent among the native as among the European community, and an equivalent increase in the number of persons seeking relief might reasonably have been expected. Natives treated, out-door. No attempt has been made to calculate the ratio of deaths to treated among out-door native cases, as the number who died cannot be correctly given. Statistics of mori- bunds. Table showing the causes of death among moribunds during 1873:138 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Definition of mo- ribunds No less than 149 moribunds were admitted into the native ward during the year. The above statement includes only those who died within 24 hours after admission into hospital. A very large number of patients besides these were admitted in the last stages of disease and exhaustion, upon whom medicine could not take effect, but who were admitted merely to be fed as objects of charity. The beds in the native department intended for curable cases are nearly always filled with incurables, which makes it little better than a moribund ward. Separate accommo- dation for mori- bunds and chole- ra cases desir- able. It is for the accommodation of sick suffering from chronic disease in its last stages that a special separate building is so urgently required. The presence of moribunds and cholera cases in the main ward renders the atmosphere unwhole- some, and prevents a more respectable class of people from entering the hospital. It is impossible to locate surgical cases in the same room with impunity, as the air is always tainted with the exhalations so peculiar to natives in the last stages of diarrhHOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 139 1866.

Typhoid fever. community. From September to the end of November the type of fever may be said to have been congestive, the brain, liver, and spleen being the organs in which the congestive tendency showed itself. Early and appropriate treatment is called for, otherwise the cases which are neglected in the first instance, are generally lost. Uræmia was one of the sequelæ not unfrequently met with requiring discrimination and judgment both in diagnosis and treatment. The majority of cases were of the intermittent character, but remittent fever of a low type was not uncommon, and a few cases of typhoid or enteric fever were seen after the setting in of the cold weather. Two well-marked cases of typhoid occurred among the European community, and a third was admitted into hospital from one of the ships lying in the port, at the close of the year. The eruption, rise and fall of temperature, tenderness in the right iliac fossa, the duration of the disease and other characteristic symptoms of typhoid were well-marked in all these cases. Mortality from fever. The mortality from fever in some of the villages adjacent to Howrah has been considerably above that of ordinary seasons. Dengue. Dengue (Scarlatina Rheumatica) was epidemic in the station and district during the greater portion of the year. In the station it commenced in November 1871, and continued till November 1872. The disease attacked all classes of the community; the rich and poor, the young and old, all were seized in their turn. It was specially severe among children, many of whom suffered from convulsions with the primary fever. The mortality, however, even among them was very small. The sequel were numerous and trouble- some, the most prominent of which were pains and swelling in particular joints, which in some instances continued to give annoyance for weeks or even months. A few persons were attacked with the disease a second and third time. Chest diseases. The admissions from diseases of lungs were comparatively small. Phthisis having accounted for ten admissions only, and two deaths in the European, and nine admissions and five deaths in the native department. There were seven cases of pneumonia, and one death among in-door European patients. Different classes of Europeans treated. The following is a comparative statement showing the number of admis- sions and mortality among in-door patients in all departments of the Euro- pean hospital during the past three years:HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 143 I am unable to account for the steady decrease in the number of in-door patients since 1869. Decrease of in-door patients. As regards seamen it may be partly due to the fact that many of them, instead of remaining on board their vessels, now live at the sailors' home, and find it more convenient when they fall sick to go to one of the Calcutta Hospitals than to cross the river to Howrah. The Howrah Institution might well be utilized as a special hospital for the accommodation of sick seamen. Causes. The falling off in the number of admissions from the staff of the railway employés is no doubt due to the fact that a large proportion of the men who were formerly located in Howrah have lately been transferred to Assensole, where a medical officer is appointed in charge of them. Nearly the whole of the Locomotive Department has been removed during the past year from Howrah to Assensole. The decrease in admissions of private patients may be accounted for in one of two ways, either that the public health has improved, or owing to the recent changes of the medical staff in connection with this establishment the institution is less popular than it was during former years. It is still the fact, however, that a large number of persons seek admission from stations situated at long distances up the line of railway which speaks well for the popularity of the institution. It is also of the utmost service to the inhabitants of the station, to the sailors of the port, and to sick persons coming from. stations up the line on the staff of the East Indian Railway Company. The following table shows the out and in-door attendance of Europeans during each month of the last nine years indicating a steady falling off since 1868:144 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The minor operations were such as are generally met with among native patients attending the out-door department of station dispensaries. There ought to be a comparatively large field for surgical practice in Howrah, but with the exception of the above accidents, no very interesting cases have presented themselves. Midwifery. Midwifery.HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 145 Improvement of Native depart- ment desirable. It is very desirable that the native department of the hospital should be placed on a better footing than it now holds under the present system. With a view to this I have asked the Native Hospital Committee to devote the funds in hand amounting to Rs. (10,000) ten thousand or upwards, to some useful purpose, instead of hoarding the money, as they are now doing with the vague idea of being able to establish a separate native hospital. This, in the first place, is not necessary, and under present finiancial difficulties is quite out of the question. When my proposal has been agreed to and the money made over, I propose building another ward for the accommodation of native surgical cases, and a separate moribund ward which will relieve the pressure that is now put on the only room in the building at present available for all kinds of cases. It is impossible under the present arrangement to accommodate surgical cases in this ward, and I have been under the necessity of removing the few patients who have undergone operations to the general ward in the European department. I am in hopes of seeing the above proposition agreed to, and the work begun, if not completed, during the present year. Changes in the sub- ordinate medi- cal establish- ment. Subordinate Medical Establishment.146 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. donations realized after the circulation of the appeal made by my predecessor during 1871, representing the low state of the finances. The sum of Rs. 11,429 was then collected in behalf of the institution. The employés of the East Indian Railway in particular deserve special thanks for the liberal manner in which they came forward and contributed on this occasion; the large sum of Rs. 3,606 having been collected by. H. Carrick, Esquire, from the Locomotive Department at Jamalpore alone. By the strictest supervision and a rigid system of economy, it is possible for the present to make the income from various sources meet the expenditure, so as to carry on the institution for another year. Reduction of estab- lishment. I have reorganized the subordinate establishment, and by the reduction of salaries in this department alone have effected a saving of nearly Rs. 300 per mensem. By the introduction of the system of contracts for the supply of provisions, there has also been a saving in wines and diet; but on the other hand, I have been obliged to incur a large expenditure in executing the necessary repairs to the building of which it was greatly in need. The furniture, mats, bedding, clothing, and other utensils throughout the establishment in every department require renewal, as owing to the wear and tear, most of the articles are unfit for further use. The balance in hand of Rs. 4,000 allowed by Government for clothing is being expended, and bills will be submitted in due course. The funds in hand are, for the present, sufficient to meet all demands. After every- thing has been paid for, it is anticipated that there will remain but a small balance, in which case it will be necessary to apply to Government for an extra grant in order to meet future expenditure. Annexed is a nominal list of the staff attached to the institution, showing the salary of each under the old and new arrangement. I am certain that no further reduction can be made in this department consistent with efficiency. Annexed also is a cash statement showing receipts and expenditure during the past year. Visitors.

CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 159 Dated 25th March 1873. From160 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS The steady annual diminution in the number of home examinations appears to me to have been caused by disappointment experienced by those who so eagerly availed themselves of the privilege on its first introduction, on finding they had to go to hospital when found diseased the same as the others, instead of being treated at home Amount of disease detected, 5. The next table shows the extent of disease detected among those examined. TABLE II. Examination. Several cases. Rate per cent. diseased.

From this it will be seen that disease among the newly-registered women has not only maintained its excess over the proportion among those who were periodically examined during the year, but was also considerably in excess of last year. Disease among de- faulters. The proportion of disease among the defaulters, however, was slightly less than in 1871. The ratios in 1871 were as follow:CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 161 a chronic condition, it becomes very difficult indeed, if not impossible, to detect the exact nature of such cases, that is, whether they are contagious or not. Under these circumstances it seemed to me advisable to detain every doubtful case of this description, and being supported in this opinion by the Commis- sioner of Police, I issued orders to this effect to the different medical officers in charge of the examining wards, shortly after I had assumed charge of my office. The measure naturally increased the numbers in hospitals, and hence the somewhat higher ratio in 1872 over 1871. The unregistered women who resort to the lock hospitals are those who are compelled by the severity of disease to seek relief. There is, therefore, no proportion of disease among them; every such case being not only diseased, but badly diseased. And here I beg permission to point out a common error in connection with the working of Act XIV. of 1868, which seems to prevail pretty generally. There is an idea that among other good effects, which must necessarily follow the introduction of the Act, ought to be a complete eradica- tion of all kinds of venereal diseases in Calcutta. But those who anticipate such results forget that while the women are subjected to supervision and periodical examinations, in order to protect the male population from contamina- tion, no protection whatever is afforded them against their being infected by the opposite sex. There are hundreds of men who arrive in Calcutta daily from various parts of the world, and there is no doubt that a large proportion of them import and spread disease; the worst among them being the sailors. As long as such source of infection continues to exist, it would be unreasonable to expect a complete disappearance of these diseases. Unregistered women. Infection spread by males. 6.

The amounts being Rs. 35,271 in 1871, and Rs. 35,036-7-3 in 1872. This is satisfactory, when it is considered that during the year under report there was an increase of no less than 904 cases in the total number treated in the hospitals compared with the previous year. In almost every item there has been considerable reduction. Thus the cost of establishment in 1871 came to Rs. 109-5-3 per patient; whereas in 1872 it was Rs. 64-1-6. Diet and extras in 1871 came to Rs. 64-9-10; whereas in 1872 it was Rs. 46-9-9 per patient. Clothing and contingencies cost in both the years exactly the same, viz. Rs. 8-3-9; and bazaar medicines cost in 1871 annas 7-6, and in 1872 annas 5, per patient. The consequence has been that the total cost per patient in 1872 was Rs. 119-4 against Rs. 182-10-5 in 1871.

It is convenient to separate the military from the civil population. TABLE VII. Ratio per cent. of venereal cases to mean strength of garrison165 CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. Although the number of admissions of syphilis was a little higher than in the previous years, there was a considerable reduction in the number of gonorr- h166 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. the large hospitals of Calcutta. Both Tables VIII and IX show reduction in the quantity of disease to an extent that was scarcely expected, considering the disadvantages and many difficulties under which the operations of the Act started. A careful examination of the tables given in this report must satisfy even the most scrupulous, that the working of the Act has resulted in great benefit to the health of both the male population of Calcutta and its suburbs, and the registered women themselves; but, even had we not such good and satisfactory evidence of decided and progressive benefit as is shown in this report, the mere fact that nearly 400 are detained throughout the year, and prevented from communicating disease to others, is, in my humble opinion, a sufficient justification for the introduction of the Act.

CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 167 I have already expressed my belief that a large proportion of disease is imported into Calcutta and its Suburbs by fresh arrivals; and Table X shows that the proportion of cases contracted elsewhere during 1872 was almost as large as that of the previous year. Medical subordi- nate. 13. In acknowledging the ready assistance I have always received during the short period I have officiated as Superintendent of the Lock Hospitals from the medical officers in charge of the different examining wards, I am bound to say that a great deal of the satisfactory results that have been obtained is owing to the careful and searching manner in which they have performed their duties. My thanks in this respect are specially due to Dr. Naylor, Sheik Moonshee Mongloo, and Sub.-Assistant Surgeon Mohendro Nauth Goopto. In addition to the work of conducting the periodical examin- ations, Sheik Mongloo and Baboo Mohendro Nauth Goopto have respectively been in charge of the Alipore and Sealdah Lock Hospitals throughout the year with nearly 300 inmates in the former, and 100 in the latter institution; and I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of both these officers in the discharge of their onerous and responsible duties. Baboo Bisso Nauth Goopto was in charge of the Bow Bazar Hospital, which was abolished in February 1872, and the patients transferred168 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. POSTSCRIPT. Since this report was submitted to Government, and while it was passing through the press, a communication was received from Dr. Payne, who had resumed charge of the office of Superintendent of the Lock Hospitals on the 6th of May, pointing out sundry inaccuracies and erroneous inferences in the report of the Officiating Superintendent. Dr. Payne's memorandum is subjoined. I have caused his figures to be very carefully verified, by reference to the original returns, and there is no doubt regarding the inaccuracy of some of Dr. Shircore's figures. I have caused these to be corrected as far as possible; but as there is an important point of practice involved, I have considered it best to permit the figures purporting to show the amount of venereal disease which occurred among the European troops garrisoning Fort William to remain as they were originally given. Dr. Shircore's mistake apparently consisted in considering cases, whose source or place of causation was "unknown," as not contracted in Calcutta, and excluding them accordingly. The practical issue consists in detaining, or permitting to be at large, women who are the subjects of discharges which may infect men. GonorrhCALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 169 No. 69.

The strong reasons for the practice were given in my report to the Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, dated 14th March 1871, paragraphs 12171 CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. to make these figures accurate, and have drawn them from the hospital books with the assistance of Dr. Moffat of the 14th Regiment.

I have already shown on the evidence of medical officers practising on the river, the enormous quantity of venereal imported by sailors. Ships arrive in large number in the cold weather, and the diseased men are subject to no inspection or restriction of any kind after their long voyages. The result is open to no doubt, though the soldiers frequent only particular parts of the town; they have not exclusive possession of these ports, which are visited by all Europeans of the same class; and the special liability to infection of these neighbourhoods from the shipping is seen in the case of the Kidderpore section, which is one of them, and is inhabited largely by the nikka wives, and other women of native sailors, who make money for the men in their absence, and are diseased by them on their return. The other military sections of this town are even better known as the resort of European sailors. The arrival of numerous ships in the cold weather, there- fore, abundantly explains the excess of disease in these months. It is only the additional accession on the arrival of new troops that is to be considered due to themselves. To apportion the respective influence of the two classes is not possible in the present state of information. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, ARTHUR J. PAYNE, M.D., Superintendent, Lock Hospital.
RESOLUTION. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. Calcutta, the 21st August 1873. READ( 2 ) 4. The death-rate on persons treated in the hospitals was 132 per mille, or the same as last year. Excluding cholera, it was 125 as against 127 in 1871. The table given in paragraph 5, comparing as it does not only the hospital rates, but the municipal returns of mortality, shows a great improvement in the public health during the last five years. In 1867 the hospital rate was 191, or, excluding cholera, 175. In 1868 it rose to 199, or, excluding cholera, 179, but since then it has steadily fallen to 132, as stated above. At the same time it must be observed that in comparing the different hospitals an element of uncertainty is introduced into these returns owing to the practice of rejecting cases believed to be hopeless at some of the principal hospitals, and sending them to the Pauper Hospital. Dr. Macnamara states that the growth of this practice is one cause for the diminution of the mortality in the Native Hospital. The Lieutenant-Governor has called for a special report on this subject. The municipal registration figures given in the return show that the death-rates of the last three years for the town generally are lower than those of the three preceding by a very marked difference, but the rate which was 22.6 in 1870 was 23.1 in 1871, and 26.4 in 1872 (not much under the rate of 1867, viz., 27.1). The rise in the rate is apparently to be ascribed chiefly to cholera. 5. Setting aside the extraordinary epidemic of dengue, which, however, among 2,292 persons treated, caused only seven deaths, the table of diseases shows that the prevalent types of maladies were the same as in former years. Of 2,761 deaths, 306 were from fever, 217 from cholera, 301 from phthisis, 217 from dropsy, 682 from dysentery and diarrh(3) is ordinarily much higher than among Europeans and Eurasians, but, strangely enough, during 1872 cholera, diarrh( 4 ) already contributed to the municipal funds a large sum of money for effecting a thorough drainage of the neighbourhood, and the College Council has been asked to aid His Honor with suggestions for improving the present college and hospital buildings. 13. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to observe that the legacy, moneys, and other funds belonging to the hospital have been brought under proper control. As suggested, all the floating deposits and accumulated interest may be at once invested in Government paper. 14. The experiment of training native midwives should certainly not be given up. It is satisfactory to see that three out of the four under tuition have passed the examinations. 15. General Hospital.( 5 ) excluding absolute moribunds. Of the 1,518 deaths among the 5,467 persons under treatment, 303 died within twenty-four hours, and 494 more within a week of admission. Most of the cases when they come in are chronic and beyond all medical skill. Half the admissions are cases rejected by the other hospitals and then brought to the Pauper Hospital, and a large proportion of the remainder are picked up by the police in the streets. Everything has been done that can be reasonably expected to reduce the death-rate and increase the chances of these poor creatures, but without much perceptible effect. The attention of the Justices will be invited, through their Chairman, to Dr. Woodford's represent- ations as to the necessity of enclosing the building and grounds of the hospital. The Lieutenant-Governor also, as intimated in paragraph 4 above, wishes to have full and exact report as to the present practice of the other large hospitals in rejecting cases or sending them to the Pauper Hospital. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Surgeon-General that the present designation of Resident Apothecary is more appropriate than the proposed one of House-Surgeon for the apothecaries attached to the Pauper and Police Hospitals. 23. The Police Hospital.( 6 ) hospital appears to be very high as compared with others. From the report, however, it is gathered that the rate among Europeans was last year only 46.90 per mille, or very little over the General Hospital rate. Among the natives, on the other hand, the mortality was very high, 263 among 700 patients. Of these, 149 were moribund when admitted; but even the death-rate among patients not of this class was 194.52 per mille. The cause of this is probably the fact that Howrah is the terminus of a great railway line, and surrounded by factories of various kinds( 7 ) No. 3202. COPY forwarded to Dr. N. C.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1873.
No. 316. FROM J. CAMPBELL BROWN, ESQ., C.B., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. Dated Fort William, the 27th May 1874. SIR, Medical College Hospital, General Hospital, Calcutta Nurses' Institution, Municipal Pauper Hospital, Municipal Police Hospital, Sukea's Street Dispensary, North Suburban Hospital, Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's Hospital, Alipore Dispensary, Aratoon Apcar Dispensary, Howrah General Hospital, Calcutta Lock Hospitals. I HAVE the honor to submit the returns and reports of the medical institutions marginally enumerated for the calendar year 1873. The superintendent has again been good enough to furnish me with the returns of the (Mayo) Native Hospital and its affiliated dispensaries. This report, therefore, contains the statistics of all the public medical charities in Calcutta and its suburbs, and I am enabled to present in a complete manner the combined results of the working of all these institutions, both as showing the extent of relief afforded to the sick poor, and also as indicating, with some degree of approximation, the general health of the community during the year. Attendance and death-rates. 2. Attendance.3 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. hospitals and dispensaries, decrease is to be observed in the North Suburban and Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's Hospitals and the Alipore Dispensary. The marked exception is the Howrah General Hospital, which alone presents a decided increase of in-door attendance during the year. As regards out-door patients, the decrease is entirely due to a large falling off in the numbers attending the Mayo Hospital and its dispensaries, which the superintendent believes to be explained by the epidemic of dengue in 1872. He states, in a communication received from him, that though the number of new cases has been smaller, "the total attendance" has not been less this last year than the previous year. During the dengue epidemic, patients came once and then did not return. All the other institutions show an increased attendance of out-patients. 3.

5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The two preceding statements show that, as would be expected, many more Christians (Europeans and Eurasians) seek relief as in-door and out-door patients in Calcutta than in the mofussil; that Hindoos in larger, though not proportionately larger, numbers resort to the hospitals and dispensaries everywhere than Mussulmans; that women and children of these two classes are treated both as in-door and out-door patients in small proportion to men. This of course is to be expected; and that women and children of Mussulmans are treated in larger relative numbers both as in-door and out-door patients than those of Hindoos. Classes and sex. 4.

In the abstract on the margin a summary of the transactions of the different departments of this hospital is given. Among in-patients there has been adecrease (excluding eye eases) of 425, as compared with 1872, but an increase of 315 compared with 1871. Transactions of the year. Attendance compared with previous years. Among out-door patients in- crease is shewn, particularly in the dispensary for women and children, where 1,874 more cases have been treated than were recorded in 1872. In the ophthalmic and dental dispen- saries there is a decrease. 12. Dr. Chevers shows that though the rate of mortality has been higher in 1873 than it was in 1872, yet that it has been lower than that in any other year since 1863. Death-rates. Statement No. XII.

In the statement (No. XII) in the margin the death-rate per thousand of the different classes for the past five years is given. It will be seen that the mortality of European males treated was higher in 1873 than it has been since 1869; of Euro- pean females, higher than that of 1872, but lower than that of 1870 and 1871. The mortality rates of Eurasians, both male and female, would appear to have been lessening since 1869, and to have been much lower for males in 1873 than has been the case in any of the four previous years. The death-rate of Natives was higher in 1873 than it was in 1872, nearly the same as in 1871, and decidedly lower than it was in 1869 and 1870. The great mortality among Natives, as compared with either Europeans or Eurasians, is again most conspicuous. Eurasians show the lowest death-rate of the three classes. This contrasts somewhat with the experience of 1872. The nearly equal death-rate of males and females in this class is also worth remarking. Death-rate according to sex and classes. 14. An interesting statement is given in the report (page 22) by which Dr. Chevers shews that while the prevalence of cholera may have diminished of late years, its deadliness has not, but on the contrary that it has been much more fatal the last two years than it has been in any year since 1866; and this has been the case both with Christians and Natives. In his remarks he cautions us against the possibility of our being disposed to attribute too great immediate and direct influence to the improved drainage and the new water-supply of the town, and of our being inclined to overlook other and more general conditions which may have tended to make the last three years noncholeraic years. It certainly seems difficult to understand how it is that, if the better drainage and better water-supply and improved sanitary condition generally of Calcutta, have lessened the number of cases of cholera, the disease should at the same time assume a more fatal character. In reality I believe the last three years have been noncholeraic years, and that Howrah and other suburbs of Calcutta, whose condition. as regards water-supply and drainage remains much as it was in former years, have enjoyed an almost, if not quite, equal comparative diminution in the amount of the disease. Cholera. 15. The total number of surgical operations has been 189. Of these only 163 were treated to a termination, and of these 163 no less than 49 died, or 300.6 per thousand, an exceptionally high mortality, much higher indeed than has been recorded in any year since 1863. Of these 49 deaths, 13, or 265 5 per thousand, were due to pyæmia and septicæmia; Surgical operations.
12 REPORT ON THE Hospitalism. but Dr. Chevers points out that 10 more deaths occurred from allied diseases. So that in fact 23 deaths, or 469 per thousand, which is not much less than half of all the fatal cases, were due to what is called " hospitalism." Dr. Chevers enters very fully into this important matter, and has discused it with great care and judgment. He draws attention to the acknowledged defects of the present hospital as regards its position and structure, which, notwithstanding all the improvements that have taken place, must still leave it subject to the unfavorable influences of the impure air of a large town, and to a hospital atmosphere engendered by the lodging of medical, surgical, and obstetric cases under one roof. He anticipates that these evils will be reduced to a minimum by the adoption of the measures he suggests. With this object in view a sum of six lakhs of rupees has been sanctioned; plans and estimates are now being drawn up so as to carry out what are considered to be the most important improvements and alterations required as far as may be possible. Obstetric ward, women and children. 16. In the obstetric department of the hospital, the results shewn are on the whole satisfactory. The number of in-door treated, though slightly less than was registered in 1872, is in excess of previous years. The rate of mortality has been rather higher than it was in 1872, but decidedly lower than was recorded for 1871, 1870, and 1869. The number of women confined in the hospital continues to shew a steady increase. Dispensary practice. 17. Of the dispensary practice in all its branches, the principal gives an analysis, which clearly indicates satisfactory progress from year to year, and shews the increasing appreciation in which this institution is held by all classes of the community. Training native females in midwifery. 18. Another year's experience of the attempt to train native dhaies as midwives has, I much regret to say, been the reverse of favorable. Great difficulty has been met with in inducing either Mussulman or Hindoo women to come for instruction; and of the six women who have attended the Medical College Hospital for this purpose during the past year, all are Christians. At the examination, to which all were invited, only three presented themselves. One of these displayed complete ignorance; the other two acquitted themselves very creditably. As this matter is again submitted for the further consideration of government, in consequence of a letter from Dr. Charles, in which he urges the useless expense and trouble of the present scheme, and requests to be relieved from an irksome and unsatisfactory duty, it need not be further referred to here. Finances. 19. It is satisfactory to find that considerable savings have been effected on the budget allowance under several heads, the total of which amounts to Rs. 12,791-15-8. On the other hand Rs. 2,029-6-4 has been the outlay in excess of the grant, of which Rs. 1,526-2-7 has been passed by government. In statement A, the financial position of the hospital is distinctly shown. All legacies and endowments have now been invested in government securities. Water-supply. 20. The water-supply to this institution has not yet been put on a satisfactory footing. Additional tanks and pipes have been fitted in during the year, so as to afford a more abundant supply to the latrines and lavatories; but there is not at present sufficient pressure to force the water up to the required level. A correspondence on this subject with the chairman of the justices has lately taken place, and has been submitted to government, the result of which is that it has been decided that further action shall be suspended until it shall be seen whether the Chandpal Ghât scheme, when it begins to work, will not permit the required pressure to be made available. In the meanwhile the water-supply is maintained by means of the hospital steam pump at considerable outlay. 21. The successful management of this large and important institution reflects great credit upon its able principal and the staff of medical officers associated with him. Dr. Chevers speaks in terms of high approbation of the manner in which Drs. McConnell and Crombie have discharged the duties of resident physician and resident surgeon respectively, and commends the assiduity and attention of the subordinate staff, and he alludes with much feel- ing to the great loss this institution especially, and the Bengal medical service generally, sustained in the removal by death in succession of two such talented and devoted men as Drs. Purefoy Colles and Cutcliffe. THE PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. Native ward established. 22. Dr. Ewart's report on this important hospital is in all respects a highly satisfactory one. The three large buildings which now constitute the hospital are each under the separate charge of one of the three medical officers appointed to the institution, and for each building a complete separate establishment for the medical treatment, and for the dieting and general care of the sick, is provided. This system is found by Dr. Ewart to work admirably, and to be far better adapted for the welfare and comfort of the patients than the centralized system which had hitherto been in use. In carrying out the new plan in all its details, he has received every assistance from the two very able medical officers, Drs. Palmer and Mackenzie, the first and second surgeons of the hospital. In August last the new or Sumbhoo Nath Pundit ward was inaugurated by Sir George Campbell, and the working of it has thus far been successful, and promises the best results.
13 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23. Dr. Ewart goest most elaborately into the statistics of this last and the preceding eight years in a series of ables, all of which are given in the appendix, and which possess much value and interest. Statistics. The total number treated is 2,723, against 3,443 in 1872; but it is in excess of all previous years, and no doubt much, if not all, the difference between 1872 and 1873 is due to epidemic of dengue, which was so prevalent in the former year. Attendance. Dr.Ewart shews that in only one year since 1865, viz. in 1871, when it was 36.52, has the death-rate been so low as it was last year, 38.9; and this holds good whether cholera be exculded or included. Death-rate. 24. Of cholera, 53 cases have been treated, and of these 18 died14 REPORT ON THE "hospitalism" in this institution. Dr. Ewart, however, urges that as this department of the hospital is increasing annually, further accommodation will soon be needed. Dieting. 31. The arrangements for dieting the patients appear to be now nearly as perfect as they can be. Dr. Ewart suggests one improvement in the dietary, which, I think, is reason- able, and, as being calculated to render food more palatable, and therefore more beneficial, I beg to solicit that His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor may see fit to sanction, and that is the substitution of ghee for mutton fat for cooking purposes. It is hoped that, if sanctioned, this alteration will not add anything very appreciable to the cost of dieting each patient; and it is certain that it will tend greatly to the comfort and advantage of those convalescing from illness. Conservancy. 32. Dr. Ewart reports that the new system of conservancy, a combination of the dry- earth and the water-carriage system, works well; and it is evident that the utmost attention to details, on which so much depends, is given to the maintaining of the cleanliness and general high sanitary condition of this hospital, and with much success, as the low death-rate proves. The only thing wanting is the pure municipal water, which has not yet reached this hospital. This, it is to be hoped, will be afforded to it so soon as the Chandpal Ghât scheme for watering the roads shall come into operation and set free sufficient water for this object. Library. 33. The library has been removed to a room in a more central position, the books re-arranged, and evidently much trouble has been taken to render it as attractive as possible to the convalescents, and apparently it is much resorted to by them. Government having permitted the small library allowance to be expended locally in the purchase of second-hand books and periodicals and newspapers, the library is kept very fairly supplied. Nursing. 34. Dr. Ewart again bears testimony to the efficiency of the nurses attached to the General Hospital, and in a special manner brings to notice the valuable assistance rendered by the matron, Mrs. Hickey, not only in the performance of her own duties, but also in the capacity of midwife; and he desires to be authorized to grant her a certificate of proficiency after due examination. Should His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor see no objection, I beg that Dr. Ewart's request may be granted. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. It is most satisfactory to find from the report of this most useful institution that increased subscriptions in 1873 have placed its finances on a more secure footing, and that with the increased means at their disposal the committee have been enabled to give three more nurses to the General Hospital. The medical officers, both of the Medical College and Presidency General Hospital, bear testimony that the services of the nurses are invaluable and indispensable. MUNICIPAL PAUPER HOSPITAL, NOW THE CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. Transfer to government 35. On the 1st December this hospital was transferred by the corporation to the Government of Bengal with the view of constituting. it an hospital of practical and clinical instruction in connection with the Campbell Medical School, Sealdah. For the first 11 months the hospital was under the charge of Dr. Woodford; for the last month it has been under his superintendence, the Native medical teachers taking charge of the wards, assisted by four resident assistant surgeons. Mortality Class of cases 36. The mortality continues deplorably high15 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Cholera cases have been more numerous than in the previous three years, as shewn below:16 REPORT ON THE SUKEA'S STREET DISPENSARY. Transfer to governors of Native Hospital. 43.

It has very limited accommodation for in- patients, for which it is ill adapted. The increased numbers treated both as in and out-door patients from year to year, indicate that it is more and more appreciated by the poor of the neighbourhood. Finances. 44. The cost of this dispensary is high, and has been hitherto entirely defrayed by the state. It has been conducted by Assistant Surgeon Money Lall. Dutt, under the superin- tendence of Drs. Palmer and Partridge successively. Cholera. 45. A list of eight cholera cases treated during the year is given by Assistant Surgeon Money Lall Dutt; his success is at least remarkable! He "cured" 6; 2 other fortunate men "absconded." NORTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL. Present condition. New hospital and out-door department in connection with it. 46. At present this is merely a shed, which affords accommodation for 36 patients, but at times as many as 45 have been received, and, the shed being open to the south, apparently without injurious results. It is situated in the Cossipore road, in the midst of a large and important suburb, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cossipore Gun Foundry and many other large factories. It is evidently largely used, and meets a want. A new hospital is in course of erection; when completed it will be a handsome two-storied building, and will make a good hospital for in-patients. A dispensary for out-patients is also to be opened in it. The estimated cost of the new hospital is Rs. 17,000, and a house for the assistant surgeon Rs. 10,00017 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

The state- ment in the margin shows that the number of out-patients has largely increased during the past year. Transfer of in-patient department to General Hospital. It was anticipated there would be a falling off in the attendance of out-patients after the removal of the in-patients to the General Hospital, but it is satisfactory to find that the very reverse has been the case, as the figures below indicate:18 REPORT ON THE THE ARATOON APCAR (GARDEN REACH) DISPENSARY. Attendance. 55. This is a dispensary for out-patients only, established and mainly supported by Mr. Thomas Apcar, who has made some useful improvements and additions to it in the course of the year. It is under the charge of Native Doctor Prankristo Mookerjee, who appears to be popular and attentive to his duties. 9,384 cases were treated, with an average daily attendance of 105.69, as against 8,402 in 1872; these numbers show satisfactory progress. This dispensary was inspected by the deputy surgeon-general of the Presidency Circle on the 27th June. He reports that the institution is evidently appreciated by the poor around. It provides medical advice and medicines for a large number of cases, not of severe illness, but which would, if neglected, become worse and cause much misery and distress. HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. Its early difficulties. Present satisfactory position. 56. A most interesting and comprehensive report of this hospital is furnished by Dr. Bird, the Civil Surgeon of Howrah. He relates the early history of the institution and the difficulties which it has had to encounter, and which he shows to have been overcome only by appeals to the philanthropic spirit of the community of Calcutta, and which have been most liberally responded to. He dwells with much satisfaction upon its present comparatively secure financial position and its vastly increased efficiency. Patients may contribute towards their own support. This hospital is a very important institution, affording relief to both European and Native sick of a very large and populous suburb. The Europeans, when in a position to contribute towards the expense of their treatment19 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. of Natives in this hospital, from the nature of the cases received, must necessarily be high, and the reasons he gives are deemed to be sufficient to account for it. 60. Remittent fever and cholera have caused nearly half of all the deaths among Europeans; among Natives, dysentery, the disease of privation and misery, was the immediate cause of death in nearly half the cases. Causes of mortality. 61. Dr. Bird submits a table shewing the admissions, deaths, and rates of mortality from cholera during the last ten years. It will be seen by it that the disease has markedly diminished during the last four years. This corresponds with the experience of Calcutta, and seems to shew that these years have been simply noncholeraic years. In this table it is curious to observe that in the first half of the decade, one year excepted, the rate of mortality from cholera was much higher among Europeans than Natives; in the last half, one year again excepted, the very reverse has been the case. Cholera. Rate of mortality in last 10 years. 62. Remittent fever was unusually prevalent and fatal last year among Europeans, as compared with the previous ten years. In 1865 two more cases were treated, viz. 48; but of these only 2 died. In 1873, 46 cases with 6 deaths have been recorded; in 1872, 8 cases with no deaths occurred; in 1871, 3 cases, all fatal, were registered. But there has evidently been some difference observed in the mode of returning deaths from this disease by the several medical officers who have successively held charge of this hospital, some recording the death under an organic affection which others would consider only as a complication of the fever. Remittent fever. 63. Only one European died from dysentery out of 34 cases. Dr. Bird is of opinion, and his figures seem to prove that this disease has been both less prevalent and of a milder type during the last four years. The mortality has been much lower with the same treatment. Dysentery. 64. Sixteen European women have been confined; no Native woman. Midwifery. The education of Native dhaies as midwives has not yet been commenced, but the matter is held in view, and Dr. Bird thinks something may be done when the new Native ward is opened. With European patients only, it is certain that nothing in this direction can be attempted. Education of Native dhaies not yet commenced. 65. Twenty-eight major and 563 minor operations were performed in 1873, as against 13 and 374 respectively in 1872. Among the major operations 3 deaths occurred, viz. 1 from pyæmia, 1 from metro-peritonitis, 1 tracheotomy in a case of cut throat. Surgery. 66. The contract system, which was introduced into this hospital towards the end of 1872, and which, in the first instance, was reported on favorably by Dr. Elliot, is not considered by Dr. Bird to be now working well; but he states that, on the whole, the articles of diet supplied have been of satisfactory quality. Dieting. 67. During the year the hospital buildings have been put in good repair, and gas has been laid on in all the wards. A new Native ward is being built, and is nearly finished. This, when completed, will add much to the efficiency of the institution. Repairs, &c. New Native ward. 68. Dr. Bird reports very favorably of Mr. Apothecary FitzGibbons, v.c., and Assistant Surgeon Gopaul Chunder Roy, in the European and Native departments respectively. CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 69. Dr. Payne, in his report on the working of the Lock hospitals under his superintend- ence during the past year, enters very fully into the question as to the beneficial influence of Act XIV on the health of the population of Calcutta and the garrison in the Fort; and he appears to prove by figures taken from the returns of all the large medical institutions, that the amount of disease within the limits comprised in the Act has been, in fact, diminished one- half since 1867, the year before it came into operation; and he also shews by the returns from the European garrison in the Fort, that the percentage of venereal cases to strength among the British troops has been reduced in the same period from 25.08 to 7.4. These results are highly satisfactory. On the other hand, the amount of disease existing outside the limits of the Act would seem, judging from the returns of those hospitals, which record the locality of the patients registered, to be on the increase, 922 cases of imported syphilis having been received in 1873, against 509 in 1872. It is to be regretted, however, that all the medical institutions do not record separately disease contracted within and without the limits of the Act, in order that more definite and reliable results may be obtained. I purpose directing that this very important distinction shall for the future be made in the register of all hospitals and dispensaries in the town and suburbs. Effects of Act XIV. 70.It appears nevertheless from table VIII of Dr. Payne's report that the number of admissions for primary syphilis in these institutions, after due allowance has been made for imported cases, has been slightly greater in 1873 than in 1872. Primary syphilis

The great reduction in the percentage of admissions from all venereal diseases among the British troops garrisoning the Fort has been already mentioned; but it is most important to notice that of the 7.4 per cent., to which sickness from this cause is now reduced, only 1.4 per cent. is due to syphilis, and 6 per cent. to gonorrhREPORT ON THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL For the year 1873. DURING the year 4,203 in-door patients were treated (exclusive of those admitted to the eye infirmary), being 425 fewer than in the previous year, and 315 in excess of 1871. In-door patients. Of these, 540 cases were fatal. This gives a mortality of 128.5 per thousand, against 115.8 in 1872, 126.28 in 1871, 138.78 in 1870, and 179.40 in 1869. Mortlity. Of these 540 deaths, 110 occurred in less than 24 hours after admission into hospital. If these moribund cases were excluded from the return, as offering no hope for success- ful treatment, the death-rate would be reduced to 105.05 per thousand of the number treated. The corresponding numbers for the two previous years were 90.9 for 1872 and 106.2 for 1871. Moribunds. These figures show a greater mortality for 1873 than for the year immediately preceding; but it was below that of every other year since 1863. The increased rate of mortality was general, and was not confined to any single class of patients, but was observed equally amongst Europeans, East Indians, and Natives, and it was irrespective of age or sex; thus:22 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

Water-supply. The only work of any magnitude executed during the past year under this head was the fitting in of additional tanks and pipes for a more liberal supply of water to the latrines and lavatories. These arrangements have not as yet met the object intended. The executive engineer, 1st Calcutta division, writing on the subject of the failure of the new system, says "there would have been no deficiency of water in any part of the building had the pressure from the main supply been maintained sufficiently high to feed the new system laid into the building." The water-supply has therefore been maintained as heretofore by means of the hospital steam pump at a considerable outlay. There is reason to believe that in a short time the pressure in the main will be made sufficient to raise water to the needful height of 50 feet. VISITORS. Visitors. The hospital was visited in the past calendar year by the surgeon-general, the deputy surgeon-general, and the Rajah Coomar of Bettia. MEDICAL COLLEGE, The 27th March 1874.

Average daily sick during the years 1865-73 THE average daily sick for each of the nine years ending with the conclusion of 1873 is noted below:38 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Death-rate inclusive and exclusive of cholera. The ratio of mortality for the nine years 1865 to 1873, inclusive, and exclusive of cholera, is submitted below:GENERAL HOSPITAL. 39 have resulted from a somewhat improved condition of the river-bank and general improve- ment in the sanitation of all parts of the town. The diminution in the death-rate has unquestionably been the result of greater attention being paid to the early removal of the cases to the hospital, whereby they have been brought under treatment by Drs. Lewis and Cunningham in greater numbers at a period or stage of the disease when the remedies employed have a better chance of mitigating its severity. There is, however, still much room for improvement, both as regards the sanitary condition of the river-bank and the city. There is much reason to believe that if the whole of the river-side frequented by the mercantile marine were embanked, so that no muddy material reeking with exhalations of a deleterious nature could be exposed to the action of a tropical sun, a still further reduction of admissions from the floating river population would be the immediate effect. But the full effect would not be pronounced unless the sewers opening into the river were simultaneously trapped with a view to diminish the back draughts of sewer emanations. The following statement shows the position in the port and town from which the cases of cholera treated during 1873 have been derived:40 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

The past year gave us fifteen cases of insolatio, of which 4 died, or 266.66 per thousand. The cases were very severe, owing to the unusually great heat of many days in the hot months; but there is reason for believing that had we not used cold iced baths most freely to reduce the temperature of the bodies of those suffering from insolatio, the mortality must have been much greater. Free purgatives by remedies administered by the mouth, strong purgative enemata, and very cold baths, repeated again and again as necessity arises to keep the temperature of the body down to normal heat, have been the cardinal means in the treat- ment of this severe affection. The more I have seen of this disease, the more am I convinced that all treatment must be directed with a view to unload with all practical expedition the alimentary canal, and to lower the temperature by the direct application of cold, not only to the head, but to the body generally, by means of cold or frigid baths repeated at short intervals whenever the temperature shows signs of rising to an undue degree of elevation. Refrigerant and cooling medicines by the mouth are also eminently serviceable in facilitating the accomplish- ment of this object. Large doses of quinine, as recommended by Dr. Waller, are also highly useful in reducing the temperature and lessening the number of rythmic actions of the heart.

It is the absence of this means of diagnosis and prognosis which constitutes the greatest objection to the water-closet system for hospitals in tropical climates. This observation is specially applicable to the earlier stages of dysenteric disease, when, by the operation of the water-closet plan of getting rid of the night-soil, the products of morbid action might, and frequently would, be entirely cast away and lost sight of, at a period, too, when the most accurate examination of the dejecta is all-important from a diagnostic and prognostic point of view. Water-supply I am looking forward to the introduction of the new water-supply from the municipal water-works at an early date. It was understood, when the filtered water was first proposed for the use of the city, that the extension of the water system of the town was to comprise an adequate allowance to the sick treated in the General Hospital. Unfortunately, however, just when the government of Sir George Campbell was on the eve of entertaining my proposal to this effect, the corporation discovered that there was an insufficient supply for the wants of the city. But as the Chandpal scheme, which is to provide for the watering of the streets and to liberate a proportionate quantity to be sold at a large profit to the public institutions in the suburbs, is now nearly completed, I hope no time will be lost in making the necessary arrangements for, the extension of the municipal water to the hospital. Presidency jail garden. The Presidency jail garden has been generally kept so clean that little nuisance has resulted; but I have sometimes noticed a very disagreeable smell from the garden, proceed- ing not so much from unutilized and undeodorized or undisinfected night-soil manure, as from cabbage leaves and other vegetable products in a state of decay and decomposition. I think with careful supervision this nuisance might be altogether prevented. I have mentioned the subject to Dr. Mackenzie, the superintendent of the jail, and I have no doubt but that he will do his utmost to remove this source of impurity and ill-health. MEDICAL SUBORDINATES' QUARTERS. Medical subbordinates' quarters. Whenever smells proceed from the jail garden, they are more immediately felt by the subordinates of the hospital, whose quarters are in the immediate neighbourhood; but there is a standing insanitary arrangement of even greater gravity in the open drain running to the north of the buildings in which the medical subordinates dwell. I think if this were converted into a pipe drain, with properly trapped sinks, and connected with the adjacent sewer, the measure would materially conduce to the salubrity of the quarters in question. My predecessor, Dr. Brougham, entertained the opinion, in which I fully concur, that much of the great unhealthiness among the inmates of these quarters was attributable to the open drain. OUT-DOOR RELIEF. Out-door relief I have endeavoured to work the out-patient department since the augmentation of the subordinate and menial establishment was sanctioned in Bengal Government letter No. 1344 dated 4th April 1873; but either an additional assistant apothecary is needed to enable me to open out the department successfully, or the appointment of my assistant, as contem- plated in G. G. 0. No. 901 of 1866 and No. 371 of 1867. LIBRARY. Library. The library is under the direct supervision of the first resident surgeon, Dr. Palmer, who is aided, as regards the mechanical work, such as the distribution of books, newspapers, and periodicals, and the re-collection and immediate care of the same, by Mr. J. Smith, the ward-master, attached to his ward. Formerly the assistant writer helped in this work; but owing to the great increase of work in the office since the whole of the details of the provisioning, clothing, bedding of the sick, and the preparation and rendering of accounts devolved upon the surgeon superintendent, I took the opportunity of the sanction of an additional ward-master being obtained, of arranging, on his appointment, that he should relieve the assistant writer of his duties connected with the library, thus setting him free to be employed exclusively in carrying on the heavy office work of this institution. The library has now been removed from its old habitation on the landing of the central building to a well lighted and airy room on the ground floor of the same. Most of the volumes that require rebinding have been rebound, and the whole have been arranged, classified, catalogued, and placed in substantial cases with glass doors. A large table, on which recent periodicals and newspapers are placed, as also forms and chairs on which, these convalescents who are able and willing can sit and read the current literature of the day, have been provided. Patients are encouraged to visit the library as much as practicable. The effect is beneficial, and relieves them for a certain time from the monotony of the wards. I feel greatly indebted to Dr. Palmer for the improvement of the library, and for the additional facilities now afforded to the sick for obtaining access to its treasures. I am glad to record the fact that His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor has been pleased, with the concurrence of the Government of India, to sanction the continuance of the practice of buying cheap second-hand books from the various reading clubs in Calcutta as opportunity offers.
GENERAL HOSPITAL. 47 The Editors of the Englishman and Daily News continue to furnish their respective newspapers gratis. Mr. Pirie Duff and Mr. Robert Turnbull have been kind enough to supply the library with English and Scotch newspapers. Messrs. Gisborne and Company have also supplied old English and Indian newspapers. NURSING. In a note, dated 17th January, to Mrs. Atlay (who has resumed her post of Honorary Secretary to the Ladies' Committee), I again bore my testimony to valuable assistance afforded by the nurses to the executive staff of the hospital in the following words: 48 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Pundit's ward. was inaugurated by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, attended by the committee of the charity and the medical staff of the General Hospital, on the 12th August 1873. The ward provides for the accommodation of 25 patients, and will, as it becomes better known, be primarily set apart for the reception and treatment of Native surgical cases. As the Chandney Hospital, under its new designation, "The Mayo Native Hospital," has been removed to the banks of the Hooghly, this new department will, in a measure, supply its place, so far at least as it will be open for the accommodation of many surgical cases which formerly found their way to the "Chandney;" but vacant beds will always be available for the treat- ment of Native medical cases. That the ward will prove a success may, I think, be fairly inferred from the rapid rise in the attendance, as demonstrated in the subjoined statement:REPORT OF THE CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION For the year ending 31st December 1873. MRS. DAMPIER. MRS, FAGAN. MRS. FERGUSSON. MRS. PIGOTT. MRS.-UPTON MRS. COLQUHOUN GRANT. MISS MILMAN. MRS. BROWNLOW ATLAY, Honorary Secretary. MRS. JACKSON, Honorary Treasurer. IN reporting upon the condition of this institution, the committee are glad to be able to give a much more cheerful account at the end of its 14th year than they could at the begin- ning. Thanks to the exertions of Dr. Ewart and Mr. Murray, President of the Chamber of Commerce, a large sum was raised amongst the merchants, whose names are added to the subscription list. This has enabled the committee to give three more nurses to the General Hospital, where the patients have greatly increased within the last 18 months. There are now 13 nurses and a matron in this hospital as well as the Medical College Hospital. Some years back Dr. Chevers begged for more nurses; but when the committee were able to offer them, in 1872, quarters could not be found for them in the Medical College Hospital: consequently 5 extra ones have been granted to the General Hospital, where the increasing number of patients made them so necessary. The letters of Dr. Chevers and Dr. Ewart speak for the utility of the nurses, and of the untiring zeal of the two matrons and several of the older nurses. We have, therefore, only to thank the public for the help they have given, earnestly begging that it may be continued. EMMA ATLAY, Hon. Secretary. 50 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. special and protracted training. With the same training as nurses receive in English hospitals, there is, therefore, every reason for believing that they would soon rival in excellency the nurses who have done, and are now doing, so much to contribute to the comfort and recovery of the sick in many of the large London hospitals. "The matron, Mrs. Hickey, requires special mention. In addition to her other heavy duties, she undertakes the duty of attending upon all the lying-in-women. She has always done this work satisfactorily, and to show how earnestly and zealously she has devoted herself to this work, I have only to state that during the past year she has attended about 35 cases, and, at my request, has gone through a course of instruction in midwifery under Dr. Palmer. So confident am I of Mrs. Hickey's practical attainments as a midwife, that I contemplate asking the government, through the medical department, to authorize me to grant her a diploma."

The following figures exhibit the admissions, discharges, and deaths:60 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The force is numerically equal to four regiments of native infantry of H. M 's Indian Army, to which it has been likened, but without sufficient reason, inasmuch as the sepoy is under strict military discipline, and can be severely dealt with for breaking any of the hospital rules, such as receiving or bringing in objectionable edibles, smoking in the wards,* or defiling the premises; whereas the police surgeon has no such powers, or a conjee-house under a guard at his disposal to place refractory patients, which is necessary for the efficient discipline of such an hospital, as the majority of the police chowkedars are of the sepoy caste, and many of them have been sepoys. The police force has ordinarily more trying duties to perform than the sepoy; their daily average of duty being from 8 to 10 hours, and they are exposed to all the changes of climate and season, which accounts for the large number of recruits annually required to replace those who have resigned.

It is situated in a healthy locality, thickly populated by people of both the richer and poorer classes, by the latter of whom it is much largely resorted to. 6. The total number of new admissions as in-door patients in the year was 92, and that of out-door patients 11,328. The following comparative statement of both classes of patients treated during the last five years shows that in each successive year the institution has been more and more largely resorted to, and this simple fact will go to establish that it is gradu- ally becoming more and more popular, and that its benefits are being gradually appreciated.

Although the weather was hot and trying during a greater portion of the last year, owing to the insufficient rains, yet the past year was comparatively healthier than any previous. There was no epidemic cholera, neither any bad types of fever. The total number of patients treated during the year was 682. Of these 396 were discharged cured, 78 had some relief, 3 incurable, 132 died, 12 ceased to attend, 22 no better, and 39 remained under treatment on the 1st January 1874. Statistics of the year. The daily average number of sick treated during the year was 35.652. A larger number of patients would have been treated had there been sufficient accommodation for them. The shed can comfortably accommodate 36 beds; but from June to December, when the season was unhealthy, at times 45 patients were treated in the hospital, and accommodation was provided for them by extra beds. For fear of overcrowding I was compelled to send away patients to other hospitals. The percentage of deaths to the number treated during the last year was 19, against 26 in the previous year. This includes 29 moribund cases which proved fatal within 24 hours after admission. Excluding these, the death-rate is reduced to 14 per cent. The result is encouraging; but still the mortality is high, and is attributable to a large number of low cases of diarrh64 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Out-door dispensary.

There is a committee, who, since the removal of the in-door patients, seem to have lost interest in the institution, as not one of them appears to have visited it during the last six months. The conservancy arrangements of the immediate neighbourhood are very defective.

"I HAVE on more than one occasion during the past year separately reported on this hospital. For a long time it was in a very unsatisfactory condition, and the subscriptions very irregularly realized.

I believe, however, that if the dispensary were better situated, it would be much more largely attended. "F. W. PEACOCK, "Magistrate."

The dispensary building was built of brick, measuring 24 feet long by 12 feet broad and divided into two apartments by a wooden partition. One of these apartments is used for dispensing medicines for out-patients, and the other to treat venereal cases, &c. The building has been kept in a good state of repair. An additional room, 7 feet long by 5 feet broad, was built during the year. This is used for preparing those medicaments that need the heat of fire, it is also a dwelling for the shop coolie, who resides on the spot. The cost of repairs and this additional new room has been entirely defrayed by Mr. Thomas Apcar. The expense incurred in making the above new room alone was Rs. 55. The sanitary position of this dispensary and its neighbourhood is healthy. Class and sex of patients treated. The statement below will show the total number of out-patients treated during the years 1872 and 1873:REPORT ON THE HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL For the year 1873. I TOOK charge of the hospital on the 1st July 1873 from Dr. J. Elliott. Superintendence. This hospital was opened really on the 1st April 1861, the day on which the first patient was admitted, and formally by the Lord Bishop of Calcutta on the 6th May follow- ing. The institution is to be regarded as the successor of the old Howrah Seamen's Hospital, which was abolished in 1852 to make way for the railway-station. Between the abolition of the Seamen's Hospital and the opening of the present hospital there was an interval of nine years, during which the medical wants of the place were very imperfectly supplied by the native charitable dispensary and by the railway hospital for Europeans. This latter was accommodated in a ruinous building, the wards of which were so damp and dark, that they were scarcely ever inhabited. When the present hospital was opened, the establishments of the railway hospital and of the charitable dispensary were moved into it, and the two separate institutions amalgamated. Brief history of the hospital. This hospital building, with out-houses and fittings, cost nearly Rs. 70,000. About Rs. 50,000 of this amount were raised by public subscription, the remainder were realized mainly from fancy fairs. The annual fancy fair of Calcutta was originated by this hospital committee. cost of hospital buildings. The hospital was well frequented from the beginning. At first the income of the institution was insecure and uncertain, and it was freely predicted that bankruptcy would compell the committee to close the doos before long an to use the building as a lodging-house. Step by step, however, the hospital won is way to public favor, and through this to liberal public help, chiefly in the shape of fancy fairs held at the Botanical Gardens on New Year's Day. For ten years, viz. from 1861 to 871, the building was kept in repair, deficiencies in the income were made good, and addiions of various kinds were carried out mainly from the profits of fancy fairs. This gave the committee time to increase the annual income, which is now, as will be seen from the balance sheet given below, in a fairly satisfactory state. In 1871 Dr. D. B. Smith, the than civil surgeon, appealed to the public for help, and the appeal was responded to with subscription of Rs. 14,000. This was an indication that the institution stood high in public esteem. In 1872 Dr. Elliott, Dr. Smith's successor, aided by Dr. Saunders, made some radical changes in the establishment, which led to a present saving in the monthly pay-bill of upwards of Rs. 200. The nurse's pay was much reduced (too much so), and the house surgeons, who had hitherto not belonged to govern- ment employ, were now drawn from the government lists. The present house surgeon in the European department belongs to the European subordinate medial establishment, while the present house surgeon in the Native department is a sub-assistant surgeon. They are paid from hospital funds; but as their appointments here cary with them the advantages of promotion and pension, they are satisfied with a less monthly pay than men who having no such prospects would be. This concession on the part of government is in my estimate equivalent to a monthly subscription of Rs. 100. The average number of daily sick during the ten years ending 1873 has been as follows:70 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

This disease is most frequently met with in the fall of the year, and in the last fall it is to be remarked that while the disease was fatal, cholera almost failed to shew itself. It frequently happens that when cholera is prevalent, fatal fever is comparatively scarce; and it would almost appear as though these two diseased conditions were related to each other in an inverse proportion. In the return for 1872 it appears that not one European patient died from remittent fever. This is probably to be explained by the deaths being attributed to the complications which often occur in the progress of remittent fever, such, for instance, as pneumonia, diarrhHOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 73 Financial.74 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.

The exercise of such philanthropy as is common in most English towns owning a destitute class would very soon lessen the evil here treated of; but such an agency as this is scarcely procurable in India on a scale sufficiently extensive to be of much use; altogether, it is not easy to see what can be done except to give each individual case all care and attention when it is brought to light. To this end a new ward in connection with the hospital will immediately be built." These remarks are equally applicable to the past year. In illustration of the remarks above made, I insert the subjoined nominal return of moribunds admitted since the receipt of the surgeon-general's order on the matter on the 24th October last:HOWRAH GENERAL HOSPITAL. 77 Cholera Cholera was met with in every month of the past year in the Howrah district. It was not, however, very prevalent at any one time, and never threatened to become epidemic. According to the mortuary returns, 870 persons died from the disease in the district in the period referred to. This is in the production of 1.46 per thousand of the population, and constitutes 14 per cent. of the general mortality. Of the 870 cases, 640 occured in the first half of the year.

CAUSES OF DEATH78 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. It indicates that a much higher rate of mortality prevailed at some places than at others This difference is doubtless partly owing to sickness and death having really been more common in some areas than in others. Still I am of opinion that it is mainly attributable to a difference in the way in which the statistics are collected. At some thanahs these are much more carefull gathered than at others. Death-rate of the district. The rate of mortality over the whole district, including the selected areas, for the year, was 10.12 per thousand of the population. This is very low, and is evidently inaccurate, many deaths not having been registered. The rate of mortality from the selected areas for the year was 27.21 to the thousand of the population. This rate is probably nearly accurate, and may be considered as indicating with some precision the rate of mortality throughout the district. Small-pox.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS For the year 1873. I HAVE the honor of reporting on the operation of Act XIV of 1868 in the town and suburbs of Calcutta during the year 1873. 2. It would be in strict accordance with rule if I confined myself to statements concern- ing the management of the Lock Hospitals only, reserving all information respecting the health of the town under the Act for my report to government through the commissioner of police It seems to me, however, that the effect of the work on the town, that is, the manner in which the object of the Act is effected, is a question of much departmental interest, and both in your office and that of the surgeon-general a full report will be acceptable. I make the present paper therefore as complete as that submitted to government through the commissioner of police. 3. In the month of November orders were received to vacate the Sealdah Lock Hos- pital by transferring all native patients to Alipore and providing other accommodation for Europeans and Eurasians, and about the same time the resident medical officer at Bow Bazar resigned his appointment The examining depôt at Bow Bazar was placed under the charge of the medical officer at Sealdah in addition to his own duties, and a considerable money saving was effected. Transfer of patients from the Sealdah to the Alipore Hospital. 4. The figures in table I show a reduction of 327 in the number of registered women during the year. They have fallen from 6,782 to 6,455. The proportion of those who, remaining on the list, have evaded examination, has been somewhat smaller than before, as shown in the column of defaulters reported. The new registrations, as reported in the police returns, have been nearly the same as in 1872. Number on register. Table I. 1873. Registered. Examined. Difference. Total of Examinations.

Taking, for the sake of just comparison, only those institutions in which the locality of infection has been recorded, we arrive at the following statement:CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. 85 16. I drew attention very pointedly in my reports to the proofs of the increase in 1872 having been due to the arrival of a new regiment with its infected men. I showed how this was in close accord with experience in Europe, and I ventured to anticipate that a second year of residence would find the 1-14th Regiment as free from contagious disease as their predecessors were when they left Fort William. The figures of 1873 justify the prediction, while the effect of newcomers in bringing disease into the town, which is soon returned to them, is fluffier illustrated by the present state of the 3rd Buffs, now in the Fort. On the arrival of the battalion, I visited the hospital and found 12 or 13 venereal cases in the wards. I drew Dr. Colles's attention to the probability of the men infecting the Calcutta women, as in former years, and he at once ordered an inspection of all unmarried men in the battalion. The result was the detection and removal to hospital of between 30 and 40 venereal cases, and a further result is that up to the present time not a single case of Calcutta syphilis has appeared among the men, and only one or two of gonorrh86 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.APPENDICES.

Presidency Generale Hospital.( 4 ) report; and as regards the suggested improvement in the dietary, noticed in paragraph 31 of the Presidency General Hospital report, the Lieutenant- Governor has no objection to the Surgeon-General sanctioning a departure from the strict scale. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to learn that so much has been done under Dr. Palmer's supervision to improve the library. Acknow- ledgments are due to the Editors of the Calcutta newspapers and the other gentlemen who have so kindly contributed to the relief of the sick by the supply of papers and periodicals. To Dr. Ewart and his colleagues the Lieutenant-Governor tenders his thanks for the efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties during the year. Government and the public are not a little indebted also to the ladies forming the Committee of the Calcutta Hospital Nurses Institution, with- out whose aid much suffering would have remained unalleviated from the want of efficient nurses. The Lieutenant-Governor understands that the arrange- ments have been completed under which a Home for trained nurses will be at once built by the Committee of the Lady Canning Memorial Fund, in close proximity to the General Hospital; and that it will be ready for the two ladies who are coming out from England under the Committee's auspices by the commencement of next year. 7.

REPORT OF THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1874.
No. 134S. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 1st June 1875. SIR, Medical College Hos- pital, General Hospital, Calcutta Nurses' Institution, Mayo Hospital, Campbell Hospital, Police Hos- pital, North Suburban Hospital, Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's Dispensary, Alipore Dispen- sary, Aratoen Apcar Dispensary, Howrah General Hospital, and Calcutta Lock- Hospitals. I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to His Honor the Lieutenant. Governor of Bengal, the report on the medical institutions (marginally noted) situated in Calcutta and its suburbs for the year 1874. 2. I have to express my regret at the unavoidable delay in forwarding this report; but no time has been unnecessarily lost in its preparation, considering the pressure of work which exists in my office; and it will be observed from the appended statement that several of the reports were very late in reaching me. 3. The superintendent of the Mayo Hospital has been good enough to supply me with the annual returns and report of that institution, and of the dispensaries in connection with it. and I have to thank the honorary secretary for having sent me a copy of the report for 1874 on the working of the Calcutta Nurses' Institution, and the Chairman of the Justices of Calcutta for having given me a copy of certain municipal statistical returns. Plan of Report. 4. This report has been drawn up in accordance with the wishes of Government, as conveyed to me in letters Nos. 900, 1465, and 4, dated, respectively, the 4th March and 8th and 19th April 1875. 5. It will be observed that there has been but little change made in the statistical portion of the Volume now forwarded as compared with those of preceding years. I consider that the forms used to illustrate the report are well adapted for their purposes. The volumi- nous return of diseases treated is, however, omitted, as the abstract on pages 6 and 7 contains all the information on this subject which Government is likely to desire. I have also, as directed in circular No. 4, dated 19th April, from your Government. omitted. the submission of the reports of each individual institution. Number of institutions 6. In 1873 there were twelve institutions in Calcutta and its suburbs which administered to the wants of the sick poor. This number was, during the past year, nominally reduced to eleven, owing to the transfer, in February 1874, by orders of Government, of the Sukea's Street dispensary to the board of governors of the Mayo Hospital.

The above statement shows a marked increase on the attendance as compared with 1873, viz., 2,025 in and 19,445 out-patients, making a total increase in 1874 of 21,470. This increase is all the more satisfactory when it is remarked that the figures for 1873, under the head of "out-door," include those who remained under treatment on the 1st January of that year; whereas those for 1874, in a similar column, refer simply to "new cases" treated during the year. An increase of both in and out-patients is observed in each individual institution, with the exception of the Mayo Hospital "in-patients," and the Alipore and Aratoon Apear dispensaries' "out-patients." The increase in the number of out-door patients treated in the Mayo Hospital and its branches is very marked, amounting to 14,259. It will also be observed that 1,107 patients received out-door medical and surgical relief at the General Hospital. 8. Of the 263,027 patients treated in the Calcutta medical institutions particulars of race, sex, and age were registered respecting 261,920. The deficiency (1,107) is due to the omission of the registration of these particulars of the out-patients in the General Hospital. Of the 261,920 patients, 156,751 were males, 42,320 females, and 62,849 children under 10 years of age. These numbers give percentages of 59.85 males, 16.59 females, and 23.99 children, against 61.8, 15.5, and 22.7 in the year 1873, and against 64.9, 16.3, and 18.8 in 1872: thus showing that proportionately, while the number of males has decreased, there has been an increase in the number of children, and in about the same proportion. Of the total number treated, there were4 REPORT ON THE Comparison with previous years. Statement No. III. HOSPITAL. CENSUS RETURNS. M. F. C. M. F.

Of the 20,921 in-patients treated, 3,197 died, the death-rate per mille being 152.8. This death-rate is higher than that of 1873, which was 143 per mille, and is considerably higher than the death-rates of 1872 and 1871, in both of which years it was 132 per mille: in fact this is the highest death-rate registered since the year 1869. This high rate of mortality is clearly attributable to the Mayo Hospital, in which the death-rate has risen from 51.8 in 1873 to 137.4 per mille in 1874. The General Hospital also shows a rise in the death-rate of 8.1, the Police Hospital of 3.1, and the Alipore Dispensary of 42.1 per mille. On the other hand the Campbell, North Suburban, and Howrah hospitals show a decided decrease as compared with 1873. It has been suggested that the high rate of mortality in the Mayo Hospital has been caused by the increased accommodation in it, and by the consequently increased number of patients, many of whom were in a moribund condition on admission. Cholera. 10. It is seen from statement No. V that, during 1874, a considerably larger number of cholera cases were treated than in any year since 1869. It is also seen that a larger number of persons in hospital died from cholera in 1874 than in any year since 1869; and the mortality per mille in 1874 has been greater (with the exception of 1873) than in any year exhibited in the accompanying statement.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 15. Statement No. X exhibits the residence of the cholera cases admitted for treatment into the Calcutta medical institutions during the year 1874. The figures for 1873 are also shown. The record is still very defective; and for this reason of very little practical use. It will be observed that of the 658 cholera patients admitted during the year, the residence of 153, or 23.2 per cent., is "not specified"; and of the 143 cases received into hospital from the river- side, particulars of 29 are not given. It is to be hoped that more care will be taken for the future in keeping up this most useful record; yet I must allow that the task is by no means a light one. From the figures of the past three years, such as they are, it would appear that the first and second divisions (the native quarter) of the town are, as compared with the other divisions, remarkably free from cholera, and that Bow Bazar Street stands highest on the list. I refrain, however, from persuing the analysis further. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. The following information regarding this important hospital is condensed from Dr. Chevers' able report:12 REPORT ON THE Death-rate of Christians. 3. The death-rate among Christians was 61.81 per mille, and exceeded that of the three preceding years slightly; but was lower than that of any year since 1863. The following table shows the admissions, deaths, and rate of mortality of the Christian patients from fevers,dysentery and diarrh13 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Management, &c. 14. The management of this large hospital has been very satisfactorily carried out under the superintendence of the principal and the able medical and surgical staff associated with him, and reflects the greatest credit on the untiring attention and zeal of all these officers. Dr. S. G. Chuckerbutty died in England on the 29th September last. He was for many years 2nd physician in the Medical College Hospital, and was well known in Calcutta as an able and accomplished physician, and an excellent servant of Government. His death has caused the deep regret of. all his colleagues in the hospital. Dr. Chevers speaks in the highest terms of the services of Mrs. Bowler, the matron, and her experienced staff of nurses, and bears testimony to the inestimable services rendered by them to the sick in hospital. He alludes to the difficulty of obtaining suitable persons for the responsible and difficult occupation of nurse, and deprecates the practice of using the hospital wards as a training ground for unpromising candidates. Fiances. 15. Considerable savings have been effected during the year under several heads, which amount to Rs. 11,115-6-6; but under the head of contingencies money has been spent in slight excess of the grant. Water-supply. 16. Water was not supplied from the municipal main, and is one of the great require- ments of the hospital. Plan for new hospital. 17. Dr. Chevers, in conjunction with an engineer officer, has planned a new surgical hospital after the Lariboisiere Hospital in Paris, and the Herbert and St. Thomas' hospitals in England, all of which he carefully inspected when at home on furlough. The plan has been most carefully considered and revised in every detail by Dr. Chevers and his colleagues in the hospital, and the new building will, when constructed, have every sanitary improvement and every convenience of acknowledged utility possessed by the model hospitals mentioned above. The imperative necessity of providing a new hospital for the treatment of surgical cases has long been recognized, and it is earnestly hoped that no unnecessary delay may occur in building it. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. Dr. Ewart, the Surgeon Superintendent, submits an elaborate report from which the following information has been gleaned. Attendance. Typhoid fever. During 1874 there were 2,437 European patients treated, with an average daily number of sick of 145.94, and a death-rate of 45.95 per mille. This total number of patients treated is less than in any other year since 1867. Dr. Ewart attributes this to (1), the shorter stay of vessels in Calcutta; (2), the absence of any epidemic during the year, and (3), the opening of an out-door dispensary in which many comparatively trivial cases, which would otherwise have to be admitted, are treated. This last circumstance also tends to raise the death-rate. The death-rate was less than the average of the preceding nine years, and Dr. Ewart justly remarks that cholera is, and always has been, throughout the past ten years, a most disturbing element in the mortuary returns of the hospital, and has given a considerably larger death-rate than any other disease during the same period. The diseases which have caused most deaths in this hospital during the last ten years have been cholera, dysentery, phthisis, hepatitis and abscess of liver, remittent fever, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and sunstroke, in order of severity. Typhoid fever proved very fatal in 1874. Out of 11 cases treated there were seven deaths, or at the rate of 636.36 per mille. Cholera. Trial of hypodermic injections of chloral hydrate. 2. The death-rate of cholera has fluctuated greatly14 REPORT ON THE Remittent fever 5. There were only eight admissions from remittent fever during the year; and of these, three died, giving a death-rate of 375.00 per mille. Cinchona alkaloids. 6. Dr. Ewart gives a full report, illustrated by cases, of a trial which was made by him of the medicinal value of the " cinchona alkaloid" manufactured by Mr. Wood, the Govern- ment quinologist at Rungbee. This " cinchona alkaloid" consists of a mixture, in the precipitated form, of all the alkaloids present in the succirubra bark. This mixed preparation, as Dr. Ewart shows, is of known composition, and is chiefly composed. of alkaloids whose anti-periodic powers have already been determined. Dr. Ewart considers this mixed alkaloid to be an excellent anti-periodic, and to be only second to quinine. Phthisis. 7. During 1874, 57 cases of phthisis were treated. Of these eight died, or at the rate of 140.3 per mille. surgery. 8. The increase in the number of surgical operations is very satisfactory, as showing the interest which the superintendent of the hospital and his assistants take in this branch of practice. The number of operations performed during the year is as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 THE CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. The following brief extract has been taken from Dr. Woodford's interesting report on the working of this institution. 1. The building is reported to be in great need of a thorough repair. Owing to the roof being of corrugated iron, the wards are exceedingly hot in the afternoon during the summer months, and to remedy this a wooden underneath roof would be a great boon. More light is needed in the wards, and forty glass sashes are absolutely necessary, as, on foggy and rainy mornings, the hospital duties are frequently interrupted for an hour or so, owing to the want of sufficient light. Building. It is also strongly urged, on the grounds of convenience and economy, that gas should be laid through the building. It is also recommended that the thatched roof of the dissecting rooms should be replaced by corrugated iron.

Dr. Woodford expresses a hope that a separate ward for moribund cases will be recognized, and permission granted also for the returns of such cases to be kept separate from the general statistics of the hospital. The latter part of the request is in opposition to present orders and usage. He also remarks that special hospitals for incurables and the blind are a necessity for this large town, and would be sure to recommend themselves to the sympathy and charity of the benevolent and wealthy native gentlemen of this city, many of whom have been promising donations and subscriptions for the purpose. Surgical operations. 7. Twenty-two major operations were performed during the year. The superintendent writes in high terms of the teachers and resident surgeons attached to the hospital, and also of the apothecary Mr. Hamilton. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General Francis paid several visits to the hospital during the past cold season, and expressed himself as much gratified on each occasion with the general organiza- tion and display of work. The institution was also visited during the year by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor. POLICE CHOWKEEDAR HOSPITAL. There is nothing of special remark regarding this hospital during 1874. Building. 1. The building requires some petty repairs, especially the floor. A dispensary and congee- house for refractory convalescents are reported to be absolutely necessary, as also a gate to the south end of the hospital premises. Gas in the wards would no doubt be an advantage. Dr. Woodford again brings to notice that the native houses and latrines which form the north and western boundaries of the hospital, still pour out their noxious gases and require proper drainage. On this point the Deputy Surgeon-General remarks:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 5.

The financial state of the hospital is in a fairly healthy condition. There was a balance to credit of the hospital funds at the end of the year of Rs. 1,750-11. Finances. It is worthy of note that the subscriptions from natives for the support of this hospital during the past year amounted only to Rs. 5. The receipts for 1874 amounted to Rs. 46,391-12-7, and the expenditure was Rs. 44,641-1-7.

CALCUTTA LOCK-HOSPITALS. The following extracts are made from Dr. Payne's very complete and interesting report on the working of Act XIV of 1868 in the town and suburbs of Calcutta during. the year 1874. 1. During the year the hospital treatment of the entire number of native women was carried out at Alipore, the Europeans and Eurasians alone being received at Sealdah. As the number of the latter was very small, the Sealdah institution was little more than an exami- nation depôt for that division of the town. 2.At the close of 1873 the number of registered Women was 6,455, but during 1874 there has been an increasing number every month, until, in December, there were 6,845 registered prostitutes.

The annexed table shows the proportion of disease as detected by inspection. It is noticed that there is but a nomi- nal proportion of disease among the women under regular obser- vation. The proportion increases among defaulters, and rises to a much higher rate among those newly brought under the act; but the proportion of disease in this latter class can hardly be taken as representing that which exists among the prostitutes who are not under the control of the Act, because disease must often be the cause of their coming under observation.

The annexed statement, showing the number of primary examinations, the number of those found diseased on these occasions, and the ratio per cent. of those diseased, affords strong evidence against the theory of spontaneous decrease of disease in Calcutta. On this point Dr. Payne remarks as follows: "If this mean nothing more, it yields at least indisputable proof that in the history of a large number of free women there is no tendency to natural abatement of disease that is progressive, and by contrast with the very marked and progressive reduction of disease among the women under control and among the general population of Calcutta during the same period, it would seem to reduce the efficacy of the not to absolute demonstration." Examinations. f
22 REPORT ON THE Home examination. 5. The numbers on the home examination list have increased from 39 to 51. Voluntary attendance in hospital. 6. It is very gratifying to learn that a large number of unregistered women present themselves at hospital for treatment, and the number of this class of patients is steadily increasing. This proves how popular the institution has become among a class who used to regard it with dislike. In fact, in order to obtain admission into the hospital when ill with fever, dysentery, &c. (diseases for which they cannot be received), they resort to the artificial production of sores on the genitals, and thus gain their point.

This table shows the number of days in hospital for treatment for disease among the newly-registered, the defaulters, and regular attendants.

From the cases admitted during 1874, it is found that the following diseases, in order of frequency, gave the largest number of admissions, viz., 1, simple ulcer; 2, soft chancre; 3, hard chancre; 4, gonorrh23 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 16. Dr. Payne advocates the necessity there is for having the coolie women employed in the Fort by the Department Public Works, or others, brought under police surveillance, and the positive statements made by soldiers of their having contracted disease from this class of clandestine prostitutes clearly demonstrates the necessity for action being taken regarding them. Coolie women. 17. Dr. Payne brings to notice the very satisfactory conduct of the lock-hospital estab- lishments during the past year, and I consider that one of the best tests of the efficient working of these institutions consists in their increasing popularity among prostitutes of all classes, who now of their own accord attend for treatment, whereas formerly they would never do so except under compulsion.

RESOLUTION( 2 ) of persons of the several races treated in past years, the increase appears to have been most marked among the Mahomedans; whilst on the other hand, there was a slight falling off in the number of Europeans and Eurasians treated. 4. As regards the nature of the prevailing diseases, the Lieutenant-Gover- nor observes that the most noteworthy point is stated to have been the increase as compared with the past few years, not only in the number of cases of cholera treated, but in the intensity of the disease. The total number of cases admitted to the various hospitals was 666, against an average of 450 in the four preceding years. In 509 cases out of a thousand the disease resulted fatally, a ratio of mortality considerably above the average of six preceding years, though somewhat less than that of 1873. As in 1873, the number of cholera cases in the 1st and 2nd divisions of the town were much fewer than in the other divisions. The records, however, are still too defective for practical purposes, as the localities in which the disease was contracted in the case of 181 patients has not been reported. It is only as regards in-door patients that details of the diseases treated are given. As com- pared with the previous year, there was an increase of more than 50 per cent. in the number of cases of dysentery, and of more than 60 per cent. in the number of cases of remittent fever admitted. On the other hand, there was a decrease of more than one-half in the number of cases of continued fever, and of phthisis, and of somewhat less in the number of cases of typhoid fever admitted. The dengue fever has almost entirely disappeared from the returns. The greatest number of deaths resulted from dysentery, cholera, and diarrh( 3 ) 2nd Resident Surgeon should be made exclusively available to the hospital with a view to promote the usefulness of this branch of the institution, but he regrets that he can hold out no hope of the concession being made.

The transfer of the in-door patients from the Bhowauipore Dispensary to the Sumbhoo Nath Pundit Ward of the General Hospital is said to have been attended by success, and it is suggested that a similar transfer should be made of the out-patients also. If the Managing Committee desire this, the Lieutenant-Governor will be happy to entertain favorably their proposals on the subject. 13. The report on the Calcutta lock-hospitals has been separately dealt with. 14. Sir Richard Temple's thanks are due to the Surgeon-General, Sir John Campbell Brown, for the efficient control exercised over the medical institutions of Calcutta and the Suburbs during the past year, and he also tenders his acknowledgments to the Deputy Surgeon-General, Dr. Francis, and to Drs.

No. 259. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 22nd May 1876. SIR, 1st, Medical College Hospital; 2nd, Pre- sidency General Hospital; 3rd, Campbell Hospital; 4th,Police Chowkeedar Hospital; 5th, North Suburban Hospital; 6th, Mayo Hospital and its associated branch dispen- saries (viz. the Chandney Hospital and Park Street, Chitpore, and Sukea's Street Dispensaries); 7th, Howrah General Hospital; 8th, Sumbhoo Nath Pundit (Bhowanipore) Dispensary; 9th, Alipore Dispensary; 10th, Aratoon Apcar (Garden Reach) Dispensary; 11th, Calcutta Lock Hospitals; and 12th, the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution. I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to His Honor the Lieutenant. Governor of Bengal, my report on the working of the marginally noted medical institutions situated inCalcutta and its suburbs for the year 1875. 2. I have again on this occasion to express my indebt- edness to the Superintendent of the Mayo Hospital for being good enough to supply me with a copy of the annual returns and report of that institution and of its associated dispensaries; to the Honorary Secretary for having sent me a copy of the report of the Calcutta Nurses' Institution for 1875; and to the Health Officer of the Calcutta Muni- cipality for having prepared for me certain statistical returns in connection with the sickness and mortality of the city and its suburbs during 1875. 3. I have had summaries compiled of the very complete and interesting annual reports of all the Calcutta medical institutions submitted to me by the medical officers individually responsible for the management of each; and from these compilations, as well as from the remarks which I shall offer on the various figured statements in this report, I trust I may be able to convey a clear and concise idea of the general working of the Calcutta hospitals and dispensaries, and of the vast amount of relief they afforded to all who sought their benefits. Number of institutions. 4. During 1875 there were thirteen institutions in Calcutta and its suburbs, exclusive of the lock hospitals, which afforded medical and surgical relief to the sick poor either as "in door" or "out-door" patients. Attendance. 5. Statement No. I exhibits the number of persons who were treated in the city and suburban hospitals and dispensaries as "in" and "out-door" patients during 1875, and in it, too, are given the results of the year 1874 for the sake of easy comparison:REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 6. From this table we see that there has been a very great increase in the number of patients treated during 1875, the excess being 50,435 patients (2,426 in-door and 48,009 out-door) over the total number treated in 1874. Great increase in the number of patients. 7. This increase in the total number of patients treated was contributed to by all the institutions with the exception of the North Suburban Hospital and the Alipore Dispensary, but it is principally due to the vastly increased number of persons treated at the "in" and "out-door" departments of the Mayo Hospital and its associated dispensaries, as well as at the out door departments of the Presidency and Howrah General Hospitals. Increase at all institutions, with two exceptions. 8. These figures, in the absence of any epidemic disease or of unusual sickness, are the more satisfactory, since they demonstrate that the classes for whose benefit these hospitals and dispensaries were opened are not slow to avail themselves of the medical and surgical advice obtainable at them. 9. Statement No. II shows the caste, sex, and age of 303,918 out of the 313,462 patients (in and out-door) treated in the Calcutta medical institutions during 1875. Unfortunately these particulars, as affecting 9,544 out-door patients treated at the Presidency General Hospital, were not recorded4 REPORT ON THE Contrasts in and out-door patients with those returned from mofussil hospitals. 15.

For the latter returns the figures of 1874 have been taken, those of 1875 not being available at the present time:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 19. The number of cholera cases treated in hospital was greater than it had been in any of the five preceding years, and the death-rate of those who came under treatment in hospital was greater than in any year since 1868, with the exception of 1873. These facts are in accordance with the observations made on this subject in last year's report. The municipal returns also corroborate this statement, as according to them the number of deaths from cholera was far higher in 1875 than it had been in any year since 1870. Increase of cholera cases treated in hospital. 20. The highest death-rate of Europeans and Eurasians from cholera was in the General Hospital, 657.89 per mille; the lowest was in the Medical College Hospital, 472.3. The highest death-rate from cholera amongst natives was 692.30 per mille; the lowest was 254.54 per mille. Highest and lowest death-rates from cholera. 21. From the above statements the opinion is not warranted that cholera has as yet in Calcutta decreased either in virulence or frequency, notwithstanding the pure water- supply and improved system of drainage; but I doubt whether, even in the face of the statistics above given, there are sufficient grounds for such a conclusion. 22. It is, I believe, a matter of fact that we rarely now-a-days find cholera amongst the residents in the Fort or in those parts of Calcutta which have come under the healthful influence of a pure water-supply, improved drainage, and the more speedy removal of filth of all kinds (animal and vegetable) from our streets and house enclosures; and an inspection of statement No. X, showing the localities from which cholera cases were admitted into hospital, tends to prove that the principal cholera haunts are still to be found in those places where filth, overcrowding, bad drainage, and defective sanitation, abound. Some of these pestilential localities are here noted:6 REPORT ON THE Statement DISEASES. MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. GENERAL HOSPITAL. MAYO HOSPITAL. Europeans. Natives. Europeans. Natives. Natives.

8 REPORT ON THE Prevalence of malarious diseases. 25. Similarly as in 1874, it is seen that intermittent and remittent fevers, and their sequelæ, viz., spleen diseases, debility, anæmia, and dropsy, were prevalent, and formed 31.43 per cent. of the total number of the diseases of in-door patients. After these, in order of frequency, came dysentery, diarrhCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 9 30. statement No. VIII shows the number of in and out-door patients admitted, and the deaths from the former, during every month in the year:10 REPORT ON THE 34. The facts in the above table, which have been elicited from statement No. IX, are in general accordance with the experience of former years, but cholera is not usually found to prevail in Calcutta to the same extent in the month of November as was the case in 1875. Localities from which cholera cases were admitted. 35. In statement No. X are shown the places of residence of the cholera patients admitted into the Calcutta medical institutions during 1875; and, for sake of comparison, the residences of the patients of 1874 are also given. This record is still defective as regards the localities from which 135 of the 778 cholera patients came, but is nevertheless useful in pointing out the most favourite haunts of cholera. Increase of cholera in all city divisions but one. Decrease in cholera cases brought from shipping. 36. During 1875 there was an increase in the number of cholera cases admitted from all the city divisions (the 5th division excepted). This increase was marked in the 1st and 2nd divisions, but was particularly so in the 3rd. There was a decrease in the number of cholera cases brought from the shipping, but Prinsep's Ghât, Armenian Ghât, Hastings' Ghât, jetties, and salt golah, furnished the greatest numbers. Operations, major and minor. 37. During the year 557 major operations were performed, occasioning 87 deaths, or at the rate of 15.61 per cent; there were also 17,080 minor operations performed. The major operations are given in detail in Appendix No. 1. Income and expenditure. 38. The total expenditure of the Calcutta medical institutions for the year 1875 amounted to Rs. 4,88,835-5-6; the total amount of income was Rs. 6,15,043-1-8. In obedience to the orders of the Government of India in the Home Department, forwarded to me by the Officiating Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal under his docket No. 2804, of the 18th September 1875, I have had a financial statement of all the Calcutta medical institutions prepared, which will be found at the end of this report as Appendix No. 2. Newspapers supplied to hospitals. 39. The proprietors of the Englishman, Indian Daily News, and Statesman newspapers, have very kindly continued to supply the Presidency General Hospital with copies of their respective papers. This boon, so liberally and considerately granted, has been duly appreciated by the European patients in this institution. State of the buildings. 40. The state of the hospital and dispensary buildings was generally good, and all sanitary details inside them were closely attended to. In connection with the question of the sanitary condition of the Calcutta hospitals, I am glad to observe that there has been a decrease in the number of deaths in the Medical College Hospital ascribed to "hospitalism." In 1875 these amounted to 8, or 25.80 per cent. of those who died after operation, but the average of the six years ending with 1869 was 31.06 per cent. Concluding remarks. 41. Having now concluded my general observations on the working of the Calcutta medical institutions during 1875, and shown the great amount of relief which has been afforded by them to the sick poor of Calcutta and its suburbs, I cannot close this part of my report without remarking that I consider such satisfactory results are in a great measure due to the ability, zeal, and humanity displayed in the discharge of their duties by the medical staff of the several institutions; and I venture to congratulate His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal upon having such a body of excellent officers to carry out his benevolent policy towards the poor and friendless of this immense population.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 Statement No. X.12 REPORT ON THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. THE following is a summary of the very comprehensive and interesting annual report submitted by Dr. Chevers on the working of the Medical College Hospital during the year 1875. Principal statistics of the year. 1. The accompanying table exhibits in a very simple form most of the principal statis- tical events of the hospital during the past year, and it will assist in illustrating various portions of the report, which, in the absence of other and more elaborate figured statements, would be rather confusing:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13 5. Of the 3,915 patients treated 1,673 were Christians (Europeans 768,Eurasians 905). Total number treated and mortality of Christian patients. Ninety-nine Christians died, or at the rate of 59.17 per mile. This rate of mortality is slightly lower than it was in 1873 and 1874. 6. There were 2,242 natives treated, of whom 499 died, or at the rate of 222.56 per mille of total treated. This mortality is considerably higher than it has been in any of the five preceding years. This increase of mortality is, in Dr. Chevers' opinion, partly attributable to the fact that during eight weeks in the very unhealthy months of August, September, and October the admission to the Sealdah Hospital of incurable applicants was forbidden. Mortality of natives. 7. The following table shows the numbers treated, the deaths, and the rate of mortality per mille of total treated of Christian patients from some of the more common diseases:14 REPORT ON THE Surgical operations. 11. At the end of 1874 there were remaining in hospital 26 patients who had under- gone operations, and 110 important operations were performed during 1875, giving a total of 136; of these, 83 recovered, 2 were discharged relieved, 3 were discharged unrelieved, 31 died, and 17 remained under treatment at the end of the year. Death-rate after operations 12. The death-rate of patients after operation, whose cases were treated to a termin- ation, was 260.50 per mile. This rate is higher than that of any year since 1866, with the exception of 1873. Deaths from hospitalism. 13. Dr. Chevers states that out of the 31 deaths which occurred after operations, there were 3 from septicæmia, 3 from erysipelas, and 2 from pyæmia,CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 29. The total attendance of out-door patients during 1875 has exceeded that of any year since 1871, and this notwithstanding the marked decrease of patients attending the medical and surgical dispensaries. Total attendance of out-door patients. 30. In addition to the in-patients, 208 persons (either parents or relatives of young children, or else young children who could not be separated from their sick parents,) were dieted by the hospital. Formerly persons so dieted were returned as cases of "privation." Other persons dieted by the hospital. 31. At the end of July, His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor was pleased to direct that new furniture should be obtained for the hospital, and that bedding and clothing for the sick should be provided upon an enlarged and very liberal scale. These additions to the furniture and hospital equipment have been recently sanctioned and are under supply. Repairs, &c., to the hospital. 32. The total income of the hospital for the year 1875 was Rs. 2,82,245-15-10, and the total expenditure Rs. 1,73,297-7-11, so that at the end of the year there was a balance of Rs. 1,08,948-7-11 to credit of the hospital funds. Income and expenditure of the hospital. 33. The hospital was visited on the 31st of December by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who was graciously pleased to present portraits of himself and of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales to the hospital, and to send a present of fruit to the patients; also by His Grace the Duke of Sutherland, the Maharajah of Cashmere, the Maharajah of Benares (who presented Rs. 200 to the charity), the Rev. Canon Duckworth, General Probyn, Surgeon General Fayrer, C.S.L., and Sir W. Robinson. Visitors. 34. The hospital was inspected by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor and by the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle. Inspections. 35. Dr. Chevers reports that the resident medical officers have discharged their duties efficiently. During the year the hospital rule that one of the resident medical officers shall be constantly present on the premises has been authoritatively established by Government. Resident medical officers. Rajendra Chunder Mitter. Kally Prrsono Mookerjee. Fakeer Chunder Chatterjee. Rakhal Dass Ghose. Lall Madhub Mookerjee. 36. Dr. Chevers mentions the house physicians and surgeons marginally named as having performed their duties in a very satisfactory manner. Native house physicians and house surgeons. 37. The subordinate medical officers have merited the approval of Dr. Chevers for the manner in which they have discharged their duties. Subordinate medical officers. 38. The assistance afforded by Mrs. Bowler and by a considerable proportion of the nurses has been most valuable. The staff of nurses, however, is still unequal to the require- ments of the hospital, and Dr. Chevers and the other medical officers associated with him still look with anxiety for the introduction of a system under which the very responsible duties of a nurse will be entrusted to none but well selected persons thoroughly educated for the work. Nurses. 39. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle reports that at the occasional visits paid by him to this institution he "has been very well satisfied with the manner in which the hospital is conducted." Remarks by Deputy Surgeon-General. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. DR. EWART, the Surgeon Superintendent, has submitted a very full and interesting report on the working of this institution, and from it the following summary has been compiled 1. The accompanying table conveys an accurate idea of the principal statistical events of the hospital during the past year:16 REPORT ON THE Total treated, &c. 2. During 1875 there were 2,905 Christian patients treated, with an average daily number of sick of 161.68, and a death-rate (inclusive of all cases of mortality) of 58.17 per mille of total treated. The total number treated was considerably in excess of 1874, or of that of any one year in the past decennial period, with the exception of 1872, when dengue was prevalent. Of men. 3. The total number of male patients (Christian) was in excess of that of any year of the past decennium, 1871 and 1872 excepted. Of women. Of children. 4. The total number of women treated was considerably in excess of that of any year of the past decennium, with the exception of 1872 (the dengue year), and the number of children treated was very much higher than that of any year of the same period. On this very marked increase of in-door patients Dr. Ewart thus expresses himself:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 8. The chief causes of mortality, in order of frequency, among the three classes, viz. men, women, and children, were as follow:18 REPORT ON THE Hospital to the General Hospital, in connection with my proposal to have two assistant surgeons appointed to the newly opened out-door dispensary." Out-door patients. 18. The out-door dispensary department was opened in 1874, when 1,107 patients received advice and medicine, but during the past year the attendance of patients had increased to 9,544. Dr. Ewart reports that this highly satisfactory increase in the number of out-door patients "is not the measure of what might have been done had the arrangements for the carrying on of this work been of a more fixed and permanent character. The dispensary has been conducted by doing-duty assistant surgeons under the supervision of the 1st and 2nd resident surgeons." Dieting. 19. The dieting of the patients was well and satisfactorily conducted, and without any complaints. Improvements, &c. 20. Through the liberality and intervention of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, the sanitary condition of the hospital has been much improved. New furniture and a substantial addition to the hospital equipment has been granted. Improvements have been made in the bath-rooms, lavatories, and latrines. By the introduction of the municipal system of drainage, the hospital has been brought into communication with the neighbouring sewer. Sinks and urinals have been trapped, the ground to the west of the hospital has been railed in, and the unsightly and jail-like wall to the north of the hospital has been removed, and the other contemplated improvements, when completed, will prove of the highest sanitary value by enlarging the compound and permitting the freest circulation of air in all directions. Nursing. 21. The Lady Superintendent, Miss Cartwright, has left for England, and her place has been filled by Miss Huband. Dr. Ewart reports that under the superintendence of this lady the nursing and all that appertains to it have undergone great improvement. Medical subordinate officers' quarters. 22. These quarters, said to be condemned long ago, are reported on as not being fit for habitation, and Dr. Ewart trusts that the question of new quarters to be built on the site of the village to the east of the hospital will be considered and sanctioned as soon as possible. At the suggestion of Mr. Wade, steward of the hospital, a reading-room, provided with the nucleus of a medical library and with the lay and medical papers, has been established for the use of the subordinate medical officers, by whom it is very much appreciated. Hospital lirbary. 23. The library now contains upwards of 3,000 volumes, and it and the reading-room (the latter established during the past year) have proved a great acquisition to the patients. Staff. 24. Dr. Ewart acknowledges the able and willing assistance he has received from the 1st and 2nd resident surgeons, and also from the subordinate medical officers attached to the hospital. Visitors. 25. The hospital was visited by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Alfred Paget, Lord Beresford, Lord Napier of Magdala, Sir Richard Temple, Sir W. H. Gregory, Dr. Russell, the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle, the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, and by Dr. Fayrer, C.S.I. Expenditure. 26. The expenditure on the maintenance and administration of the hospital during the past year amounted to Rs. 1,14,772-15.6. This sum is exclusive of the amount expended under the following heads, and to the cost of which the Surgeon Superintendent had not any access, viz. 1st, the cost of repairs, &c., by the Department Public Works; 2nd, of medicines and instruments supplied by Medical Store Department; 3rd, of salaries, &c., of nurses provided for by the Nurses' institution; and 4th, of the salary, &c., of the Lady Superintendent placed at the disposal of the hospital by the trustees of the Canning Home for Nurses. Remarks by the Deputy Surgeon- General of the Presidency Circle. 27. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle, in his memorandum 94E, of the 15th February 1876, giving cover to the annual report of this hospital, writes thatCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 THE CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. DR. WOODFORD, Superintendent of the Campbell Medical School and Hospital, has submitted an interesting report, and from it this summary has been compiled. 1. The following table shows the principal statistical events during the past year as regards in-patients; out-door patients are not relieved at the hospital:20 REPORT ON THE Admissions and rates of mortality from some of the more prevalent diseases. 7. The following table shows the admissions and rates of mortality from some of the more prevalent diseases treated during 1875:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, the Surgeon-General, the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle, and the Officiating Sanitary Commissioner for Bengal, also visited the hospital. 18. The following statements show the receipts and expenditure of the Campbell Hospital during the year 1875:22 REPORT ON THE From this statement it appears that while the greatest amount of sickness was in the divisions stationed in the suburbs and town, the greatest mortality was from the Hooghly Bridge and suburbs divisions. The excellent health and trifling mortality of the river police division is very remark- able, and no explanation of the fact has been offered. Why the river police division has been so healthy is a subject worthy of investigation, as it might thus be determined how far the discharge of the Fort sewage into the river, and the emanations from the exposed and unembanked portions of the foreshore, may be considered as causes of sickness to the shipping population generally. Building. 7. The hospital has been repaired, and the floor of the verandah was renewed during the past year. Good results from careful examination of recruits. 8. Dr. Woodford states that he has carefully examined the recruits before their admission into the service, and as a result the sickness of the force has been reduced from 6 to 3 per cent.

The new hospital at Cossipore, which was completed two years ago at a cost of Rs. 20,000, has not as yet been occupied, as owing to want of funds a residence for the medical officer and the other necessary out-offices have not yet been built. New hospital at cossipore still unoccupied. It is stated that a sum of Rs. 10,000 will be required for the erection of these buildings, but as Rs. 7,000 of this sum has been collected, principally through the exertions of Mr. W. Wells, late Officiating Magistrate of the 24-Pergunnahs, and Mr. Lambert, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, I trust that in my next report I shall be able to state that the new hospital at Cossipore is in full working order. 4. The hospital is under the management of a committee of European and native gentle- men, who are either resident or hold property in the suburbs, the Magistrate of the 24-Pergunnahs being ex officio the chairman of the committee. Committee of management. 5. The North Suburban Hospital is centrically situated with respect to the neighbour- ing villages of Cossipore, Paikpara, Sinthee, &c., and from them, as well as from other distant places, such as Dum-Dum, Manicktollah, &c., poor people apply to the hospital for medical and surgical relief. The hospital has proved eminently useful to the artisans and labourers who work in the gun foundry, the Cossipore sugar-works, the Barnagore jute factory, and other jute screw-presses and factories in its vicinity, in which, owing to the extensive employment of machinery, severe accidents are of rather frequent occurrence, and the assistant surgeon reports that from the valuable surgical aid afforded in such cases the popularity of the institution has been much increased. Situation, central. 6. The hospital is still located in the shed mentioned in previous reports. This shed is large and commodious; has pucca walls on three sides, the front being open; and the patients are protected from sun and rain by large canvas purdahs. However, owing to the floor being on a level with the surrounding ground, the place is damp, and but ill-suited for the treatment of the sick Hospital shed still in use. 7. The Government contributes the pay of the assistant surgeon in charge and the cost of the European medicines and surgical instruments. The remaining expenses are defrayed from the monthly subscriptions and donations.

There were 46 cases of cholera treated, against 27 in 1874. Of these 25 died, or with a death-rate of 543.47 per mille of total cholera cases treated. These cases came from the following localities:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 3.

There was a very marked increase (as it was predicted in last year's report there would be,) in the number of in-door patients treated in the Mayo Hospital (1,573 against 407 in 1874), but there is a falling off in the numbers treated in the Chandney Hospital (433 against 592 in 1874) Great increase of in-door patients. The death-rate of the in-door patients treated in the Mayo and Chandney Hospitals was lower by nearly 20.00 per mille than that of 1874. 5.Judging from the returns of the Mayo and Chandney Hospitals, there does not seem to have been any disease unusually prevalent during 1875. Zymotic diseases, injuries, and cases requiring surgical interference, have contributed a large proportion of the total number treated. Causes of sickness. There were 47 cases of tetanus treated (in the two hospitals), with a mortality of 26, or at the rate of 553.19 per mille. Regarding these cases the Surgeon.

The committee have, however, decided to build latrine and bath-room accommodation in a separate wing, which is now in course of erection, and it is to be hoped that funds will be collected to build the remaining one required. The general repairs of the hospital will, it is stated, be executed during the present hot weather. 13. The finances of the hospital are still in a tolerably healthy condition. At the end of the year there was a cash balance to credit of the hospital funds of Rs. 543-11-3. Finances and expenditure. The total receipts for 1875 amounted to Rs. 35,065-10-3, and the expenditure to Rs. 34,521-15-0. Of the donations received during the year, Rs. 1,465-2-6 were contributed by Europeans and Rs. 25 by natives. The average cost of each patient's diet in the European department of the hospital was annas 8-6½ per diem, and anna 1-11½ in the native. 14. The conservancy of the hospital is now under the management of the municipal authorities. Conservancy. The municipal authorities have bought two new sites in which to bury the night-soil, and the question of burning instead of burying it has been under discussion. The main difficulty in the disposal of the night-soil seems to consist in its conveyance through the streets to the place for its disposal, as it is found impossible to get the work done during those hours while the streets are empty, and, owing to the carelessness of the sweepers, the filth carts, though well constructed, have frequently been a cause of most serious annoy- ance to people passing through the streets. The Magistrate is of opinion that this state of affairs must continue until a night-soil cart is invented which shall seal itself without the necessity of any special appliance to be worked by natives. A drainage scheme for Howrah seems to have been under consideration, but owing to the direction of the levels, &c., and the cost of carrying it out in its integrity, was found to be far beyond the resources of the municipal funds. It seems that Howrah is composed of two portions, of which the circumstances, as regards the question of drainage, are widely different. The first of these portions, that which is principally inhabited by Europeans and Eurasians, is metropolitan in character, and comprises an area of two miles or under; the other portion is entirely rural, consisting of an agglomeration of densely packed native houses, and has an area of between 10 and 11 square miles. It is considered that the only way of dealing practically with the drainage of Howrah is to treat the metropolitan and rural areas separately. For the former it is proposed to have an under-ground system of masonry drains, for the latter a system of open grassed drains debouching upon tanks. The masonry drain scheme, it is stated, has been carried out to a small extent, but it is also stated to be undeniable that it has done a great deal for metropolitan Howrah, and, in the opinion of the Magistrate, will, in its completed state, do all that is claimed for it, and effectually relieve Howrah of the rainfall water. 15. The municipal, district, and Government railway police (strength not given) have been treated in this hospital during the year. The daily average number sick of the police force in hospital was 17.95. Dr. Bird remarks that a large proportion of the sickness which prevailed amongst the policemen he treated is indirectly traceable to insufficiency of food. Police treated in hospital. 16. Mr. Assistant Apothecary Fitzgibbon, v.c., is reported to have worked zealously during the year. 17. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle inspected this hospital on the 11th February 1876. He remarks:30 REPORT ON THE BHOWANIPORE DISPENSARY. THE report on this dispensary for 1875 was written by Assistant Surgeon Heera Lall Bose. 2. This dispensary, for the treatment of in and out-door patients, was opened in 1840; in 1873 its in-door department was transferred to the General Hospital, in which institution it now forms the. Sumboo Nath Pundit Ward. 3. The dispensary is in a hired building, which is said to be in fair repair, and affords good accommodation for the out-patients; the furniture is ample for all requirements, and is in fair condition. 4. The following statement conveys an accurate idea of the relief afforded during 1875, as it shows the total numbers treated and the castes &c., of the patients:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 31 3. The following table shows the number of patients to whom medical and surgical aid was afforded by the in and out-door departments of the dispensary:32 REPORT ON THE 5. During 1875 the receipts of the dispensary amounted to Rs. 1,479-1-6, and in this sum was included Rs. 284, the aid afforded to the dispensary by Government at the rate of Rs. 15 per mensem, and drawn in arrears from the 3rd June 1874 to 31st December 1875. The expenditure of the year was Rs. 898-4-3, so that on the 31st December there was a balance in hand to credit of dispensary funds of Rs. 580-13-3. 6. No epidemic disease of any kind was observed. 7. The native doctor performed 213 minor operations. Report of Deputy Surgeon-General. 8. The Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle inspected this dispensary on the 19th January 1876. He reports that the medicines were sufficient in quantity and properly kept; the instruments were in good order; the records were properly kept, and up to date; and Surgeon-Major Gayer reports that the native doctor is fit for the post, and is well conducted. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. THIS institution has been in existence for the last 16 years, and apparently has not lost its claim on the liberality of the public. By the generosity of the Committee of the Canning Memorial Fund the services of a lady superintendent of the nurses at the General Hospital have been offered to, and gratefully accepted by, the Committee of the Hospital Nurses' Institution. Miss Huband has undertaken this office for the male wards of the hospital, and by her daily instruction and superintendence of the nurses has already effected a marked improvement. This lady's salary, &c., are paid from the Canning Memorial Fund, and another lady superintendent of nurses is expected from England, whose expenses, salary, &c., will also be paid from the same fund. 2. Through the exertions of the honorary treasurer and of the other members of the committee a larger sum than usual has been received by subscriptions and donations, and amounted to Rs. 9,113 in the year 1875. The total amount to credit of the institution for 1875 was Rs. 23,746-6-8, and the expenditure of the year was Rs. 19,336-14-9, so that there was a balance to credit of the institution at the end of the year of Rs. 4,409-7-11. CALCUTTA LOCK HOSPITALS. THE following summary has been compiled from the general report on the administration of the Contagious Disease Act (XIV of 1868) for the year 1875, submitted by Dr. Payne, Superintendent of the Lock Hospitals, to the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta. Dr. Payne has obligingly forwarded a copy of this report for my information. Establishments. 1. The establishments at Alipore, Chitpore, Sealdah, and Lall Bazar, have remained unchanged during the year. New registrations. 2. There has been a very marked and progressive increase in the monthly number of new registrations during the past year. At the end of 1874 the number of registered pros- titutes was 6,845, but on the 31st of December 1875 this number had increased to 7,925, or to 1,080 in excess of those on the roll at the commencement of the year. The highest number registered in any one month was in August, during which there were 166 new names entered, and the lowest was in January, when there were but 43; in February there was a decrease of 5 on the numbers borne on the register for the preceding month. Although there has been a great increase in the number of registered prostitutes, there has not been a corresponding addition to the number of those who attended the periodical examinations; so that, as Dr. Payne remarks, probably the full benefit derivable from the addition of new names on the register has not as yet been realized. Defaulters. 3. The number of "defaulters reported" has risen from 568 in January to 670 in December, and this latter number represents 8.45 per cent, of the then registered prostitutes.

It was remarked in last year's report that there was but a nominal proportion of disease among the women under regular observation; the annexed table shows that this statement will hold good also for 1875, as it is seen that those women who were examined at their homes, and those who regularly attended the periodical inspections, were diseased but to a very trifling extent, while the number of infected women detected amongst the other classes has varied from 9.09 per cent. of the defaulters to 100.00 per cent. of the unregistered.
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 33 This table also conveys a fair idea of the amount of venereal disease there is amongst the registered prostitutes, and warns us of the extent to which it would spread should any relaxation of the provisions of the Contagious Disease Act ever be permitted. Indeed it forcibly impresses on all concerned the necessity which still exists for working the Act with further stringency if possible. 5. The number of women who prefer to be examined at their homes rather than to attend at the depôts for this purpose has ranged between 50 and 57 during the year, against 39 to 51 in 1874. Home examinations. 6. The attendance of unregistered women at the lock hospital for treatment for venereal diseases has not been so large as in previous years, but a large number of women have artificially caused ulcers on the genitals, simulating chancre, in order to be admitted into hospital and thus obtain treatment for other diseases, such as dysentery, &c., for which per se they could not be received into a lock hospital.

Expenditure 11. The total amount expended on the lock hospital and examination depôts during 1875 (inclusive of establishment, diet, and extras, clothing and contingencies, and bazar medi- cines,) was Rs. 35,199-1-8, or at the rate of Rs. 124-13-1 per patient. Owing to the increase of the numbers under treatment, there was an absolute rise in the amount expended of Rs. 4,285, and a fall of Rs. 17-14-6 in the cost of each patient. Increase of veneral cases treated at Gurrun- hatta Dispensary. 12. There has been a very considerable increase in the total number of venereal cases treated in the other civil hospitals and dispensaries in Calcutta, viz. a total of 9,235, against 7,941 in 1874; but on examination of the returns this increase is almost solely due to the great excess of venereal cases which have been treated in the Gurrunhatta Dispensary, and to the trifling increase in the numbers returned from the Park Street Dispensary. In the returns from the other hospitals and dispensaries there have been fewer venereal cases treated during 1875 than there were during 1874. European garrison APPENDICES. STATEMENT NO. I.

MEDICAL. CALCUTTA, THE 11TH JULY 1876. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) largest number of in-door patients was admitted during the months of November, October, August, September, December, and July. The month of February is shown to have been the most healthy of the year. The greatest mortality occurred in November; and the lowest in June. The large number of deaths in November is exceptional, and is attributed to the unusual prevalence of cholera during that month, as during previous years the largest proportion, or 31.43 per cent. of the patients treated, were suffering from intermittent and remittent fevers with their sequelæ. The diseases next in order of frequency appear to have been dysentery, diarrh( 3 ) Alipore Dispensary.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1876.
No. 407. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 14th June 1877. Report compiled in an almost similar form with those of preceding years. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward my report on the working of the Calcutta medical institutions during the past year, for submission to His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. This report has been compiled in an almost similar form with those of preceding years, because I considered that, while by doing so I could convey a clear idea of the working of the institutions and of the amount of medical and surgical aid afforded to the large number of in and out-door patients treated in them, I should at the same time add another number to the useful series of these annual pamphlets, which will always be available for reference, and which, from being drawn up in the manner just stated, will conveniently and readily assist in supplying whatever information may be required regarding the Calcutta hospitals at any future time. The medical institutions reported on. 1st, Medical College Hospital; 2nd, Presidency General Hospital; 3rd, Camp- bell Hospital; 4th, Police Chowkeedar Hospital; 5th, the Mayo Hospital and its associated dispensaries; 6th, the North Suburban Hospital; 7th, the Alipore Dis- pensary; 8th, the Bhowanipore Dispen- sary; 9th, the Arratoon Apcar Dispensary; 10th, the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Insti- tution; 11th, the Howrah General Hospital; and 12th, the Calcutta Lock- hospitals. 2. The medical institutions which form the subject of the present report are shown in the margin, and it will be observed that they have remained unchanged during the year under review. I have again included with them the Calcutta Lock-hospitals and the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution3 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 4. Before making any comment on the preceding statement, it may be as well to mention that the figures given in it under the headings "in-door" and "out-door" represent the total number of patients treated, i.e. the total of the cases remaining from the preceding year, along with the new admissions of the year under review; and also that the 4,352 in-door patients of the Medical College Hospital include 3,818 treated in the medical, surgical, and midwifery wards, and 534 in the eye infirmary. The latter number (534), from which no death was recorded, has been excluded from the calculation of the death-rate. Explanation of the figures in Statement No. I. 5. As regards the in-door patients, it will be noticed that, as compared with 1875, there was a decrease in the total number treated by 981, and on further analysis of the figures, it is found that this result was due to a falling off in the number of patients in the Medical College Hospital by 104, in the Campbell Hospital by 1,142, in the Police Hospital by 619, and in the Alipore Dispensary by 9; notwithstanding that, there was an increase of 765 patients in the General Hospital, 23 in the Mayo Hospital, 10 in the North Suburban, and 95 in the Howrah Hospital. It may therefore fairly be a matter for congra- tulation that the decrease in the total number of in-door patients treated was mainly due to the excellent health enjoyed by the police force and to the markedly fewer number of admissions into the Campbell or Pauper Hospital. Decrease in the number of in-door patients treated as compared with 1875. 6. It will be noticed, too, that the total number of out-door patients treated fell short of that recorded in 1875 by 2,465. This was principally due to a decrease of 4,098 patients treated at the Mayo Hospital and its associated dispensaries (vide paragraph 8 of that sum- mary), and of 695, 3,432, and 1,473 at the Medical College Hospital and the Bhowanipore and Alipore Dispensaries respectively. These results, however, have been in a measure compensated for, if indeed they have not been to a very large extent produced, by an increase of 6,794 in the out-door department of the General Hospital, and of 20 and 464 at the Garden Reach Dispensary and Howrah General Hospital respectively. It has been remarked elsewhere in this report (vide paragraph 4 of the Alipore Dispensary summary) that the increasing popularity of the out-door department at the General Hospital was assigned to be the cause of the falling off of the attendance at the Bhowanipore and Alipore Dispensaries. Decrease in the number of out-door patients also. 7. A decrease in the death-rate is noticeable in the General Hospital and the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals, while in the remainder there was an increase varying from .43 per mille in the Police Hospital to 13.89 per mille in the North Suburban Hospital. For explanation of the high death-rate in the North Suburban Hospital, refer to paragraph 3 of that hospital report. The decrease in the mortality of the following institutions was well marked, viz. in the Alipore Dispensary by 83.16 per mille, and in the Campbell and General Hospitals by 30.32 and 10.23 per mille respectively. Death-rate. 8. It has already been shown that the total number of in and out-door patients treated in the Calcutta medical institutions amounted to 310,016; but it is not the less satisfactory to be able to state that out of this number, no fewer than (in-door 21,145, out-door 286,085) 307,230 were new cases. Number of new cases, in and out-door. 9. In Statement No. II is shown the race and sex of the total number of in and out- door patients treated. This year have been enabled to render this return in a complete form, as the registration of the out-door patients at the General Hospital, with regard to the particulars required for its compilation, has been carefully carried out.

It will be observed that there is a very close agreement between these percentages and those of the four preceding years, as shown in the following table:4 REPORT ON THE Proportion of the sexes to the total number of each race treated.

From this it appears that, as com- pared with 1875 there was a decrease in the proportion of European males and females treated in the Calcutta hospitals, while that of European children had increased by 3.4 per cent. The proportion of the sexes of the other races shows but little variation from the figures given in last year's report, and calls for no special corm- ment from me. The most noticeable feature in Statement No. III is the small proportion, as shown in the census return, which the females bear to the males amongst the Mahomedans, "other castes," and Hindoos, leading to the conclusion that somehow a considerable portion of the population of Calcutta represented by these castes escaped inclusion in the census returns, from being either an unsettled lot or non-resident at night. No comparative deductions can be made from this census return, as in it the children are included with the males and females, whereas in the hospital returns they are shown separately, Proportion according to race and sex of those treated in the Calcutta and Mofussil hospitals. 11. The proportion which the several races and the sexes of each race contributed to the in and out-door departments of the Calcutta and mofussil hospitals is shown in State- ment No. IV.

In the mofussil hospitals the Mahomedan and Hindoo patients were in excess, the latter more particularly so. Amongst the out-door patients it will be observed that a larger proportion of Christians, Mahomedans, and "other caste" was treated at the Calcutta than at the mofussil hospitals, but in the latter the Hindoos were considerably Statistics of the patients treated in hospital for the past nine years. 12. From Statement No. V it will be gathered that, firstly (excluding 534 patients in the Eye Infirmary), the total number of in-door patients treated in the Calcutta medical institutions during .1876 was 21,832. Of this number 3,226 died, or at the rate of 147.76 per mille of total treated; but the mortality in the Calcutta hospitals was at the rate of 172.08 per mille, and in the Suburban hospitals 166.28 per mille of total treated; Secondly, that 740 cholera cases were treated, of which 399 proved fatal, or at the rate of 539.18 per mille; and thirdly, that, excluding the cholera cases, the death-rate of the total number of in-door patients treated was 134.03 per mille.

On a further analysis of the figures given in this statement, it is found that the number of in-door patients treated during 1876 exceeded the average of the eight preceding years by 2,955, and was also in excess of the number treated in any one of those years, with the exception of 1875. The death-rate, too, from all diseases was 7.36 per mille lower than the average of the eight preceding years, and was lowert han that of any year of this period, with the exception of 1870, 1871, 1872, and 1873. 13. Of cholera, as observed among the hospital patients, it may be said that there were fewer cases treated in 1876 than in 1875, but considerably more than in any year from 1870 to 1874 inclusive. The large number of cholera cases treated in 1868 and 1869, with a comparatively small death-rate (considering the class of native patients who are admitted into hospital), and the marked decrease in these cases after 1869, with a still lower, but again increasing, mortality, will no doubt attract attention. In the absence of any satisfactory explanation regarding this extraordinary fluctuation in the admissions and mortality from cholera, I shall merely observe that the decreasing number of admissions in 1869, 1870, and 1871 appears to have been coeval with the introduction of a pure water supply and an improved system of drainage; but it is less easy to account for the gradual and slight increase noticeable since 1872, unless it may have been dependent on an increased day or working population brought in from the suburbs and from even greater distances. Cholera. The mortality from cholera as observed in the Calcutta hospitals during the past nine years has varied considerably, viz. from 426 per mille of tile number treated in 1870 to 539 per mille in 1876. I cannot believe that the disease has of late years assumed a more virulent type, and that the increased mortality from it may be thus accounted for; on the contrary, I consider that the hospital death-rate cannot be accepted as affording a crucial proof of a more fatal type of disease, but rather because the ratio of mortality depends much on the width of the area of attacks. Mortality from cholera. 14. From an examination of the reports of each hospital, it will be found stated in paragraph 9 of that of the Medical College Hospital that the number of Christian patients admitted with cholera during 1876 was 42 below the average of the ten preceding years, and in paragraph 10 of the same report that the admissions of native patients were likewise very much below the average of the same period. In the Campbell Hospital (paragraph 11 of the summary) there were fewer admissions from cholera than in either of the two preceding years. In the Police Hospital (paragraph 10) there was a marked decrease in the number and severity of the cholera cases admitted as compared with the average of the five preceding years. In the Mayo and Chandney Hospitals there was a slight decrease in the number of cholera cases treated, and the same remark holds good for the Howrah General Hospital. Decrease in the number of cholera cases treated in the hospitals. 15. The patients treated in the hospitals enumerated in the preceding paragraph represent pretty fairly the several gradations of the Calcutta native population6 REPORT ON THE with a correspondingly improved death-rate. These ideas may by some be considered as thoroughly Utopian, but I think they will not be regarded as such by those who are acquainted with the history of the cause, outbreak, and disappearance of some of those pestilential diseases that were observed in London during the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th centuriesCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 There was a decrease in the number of cholera cases by 47 as compared with 1875, but there was an increase of the mortality from them by 25 per mile in 1876.

10 REPORT ON THE Some statistics of sickness and mortality of European and Native patients. 19. The following table, which has been compiled from Statement No. VI, shows clearly the number of Christian and Native patients who were treated for some of the more important diseases, as well as the rate of mortality of the two races from them. These statistics are interesting, as exhibiting how much more fatal these diseases (tetanus excepted) have been amongst the native patients, a result most probably due to the smaller resistance that this class of patients is able to make against attacks of sickness, in consequence of ,their inferior physique.

Such a result must beyond doubt be dependent either on a total absence of all sanitary arrangements, or on an extremely faulty and defective condition of such as may exist. However, by the introduction of a pure water-supply and a thorough system of drainage, conjoined with such conservancy and other sanitary improvements as have been already so forcibly represented by the Health Officer to be necessary, I would hope that the report of each succeeding year may show a decreasing number of cases of cholera and deaths from it. Cholera, as observed in Calcutta, may be considered as mainly engen- dered by those impurities imparted by the combined influence of filth and bad drainage, to those two chief essentials for the preservation of the public health, viz. pure air and an uncontaminated water-supply. 25. It will be noticed in statement No. VII that there was, as compared with 1875, an increase of cholera in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th divisions of the city, and in the west suburban district. The increase in the 5th and 6th divisions was well marked. There was also an increase in the number of cases of cholera admitted from the riverside, which, in the case of the shipping at the Esplanade moorings, shows a great increase on the numbers registered in 1875. Increaee of cholera in certain divisions. 26. In Table No. I of the Appendix will be found a list of the more important surgical operations performed in the various hospitals. There were 669 of these operations performed, with a death-rate of 11.06 per cent. The greatest number of operations was performed, as might be expected, in the Medical College, the Mayo, and the General Hospitals. It is very satisfactory to observe that in the Medical College Hospital out of 40 deaths following operation, but two could be assigned to hospitalism, viz. one from pyæmia and one from erysipelas. Such a result is most encouraging, and points to an improved sanitary condition of the wards, even before the intended enlargement of the institution now under consideration has been commenced. Operations. 27. A detailed statement of the income and expenditure of the Calcutta medical institutions will be found in Table No. II of the Appendix. The total income of the year was Rs. 6,27,044-13-1 and the expenditure Rs. 5,07,473-6-7, so that on the 31st December there was a balance in hand of Rs. 1,19,571-6-6. Income and expenditure. 28. The Principal of the Medical College and the Superintendent of the General Hospital (see the summary reports of these hospitals) report very favourably of the present system of nursing carried on in connection with, and under the superintendence of, the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution and the gifted Lady Superintendent of the Lady Canning Home. To those ladies who have so generously devoted a considerable portion of their time in superintending the nursing arrangements and exerting their influence in collecting funds wherewith to extend the usefulness of this institution, is due the lasting gratitude of the citizens of Calcutta and of the shipping population generally of this port. The institution itself is well deserving of that pecuniary support which is still so much needed by it, in order to permit of the employment and proper training of a greater number of nurses. The annual statement of the Nurses' Institution will be found further on in this report. Nursing. 29. The general repairs of the hospital buildings seem to have been well attended to during the past year. In some hospitals certain important sanitary improvements were made inside the buildings, as well as in the grounds surrounding them. I refrain from making any allusion either to the proposed erection of new buildings, or to the alterations which have been proposed in those at present in occupation, as I am of opinion that in every case, more particularly in the case of hospitals where a considerable sum of public money is likely to be expended, it is more satisfactory for Government, for the Medical Department, and for all concerned to have the expediency for such alterations or new buildings determined on, as is the case at present, by a thoroughly competent committee, rather than to incur expense on the ipse dixit of any officer, even though his opinion may be ever so reliable. As to the improvements which have been effected during the year, and regarding others which were considered necessary, I would refer to paragraph 26 of the report of the Medical College Hospital, to paragraphs 12, 18, 20, and 21 of that of the General Hospital, to paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the Campbell Hospital, and to paragraph 17 of the Howrah Hospital. Buildings. 30. The following changes took place amongst the hospital staff during the year. Dr. Norman Chevers, who was Principal of the Medical College, and ex officio first Physician to the Medical College Hospital since the 27th April 1861, retired from the service on the 31st March, having served Government, both faithfully and with great ability, for a period of nearly 28 years. It may be unnecessary to review the eminent services rendered by Dr. Chevers during the long period he was Principal of the Medical College, as they are well known to Government, and were acknowledged by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in the resolution on my report of these institutions for 1875. I may, however, remark that, in publishing his able paper on the health of the European soldiers in India, he set the machinery in motion by which the necessity for a more extended knowledge of hygiene became so apparent, and by means of which the condition of the British soldiers serving in India, as well as of their families, has of late years become so materially improved. With Changes amongst the hospital staff.
12 REPORT ON THE mature experience as a medical jurist, he compiled his work on Medical Jurisprudence, which is considered by all judicial and medical officers in India to be a reliable authority in cases of difficulty, as it contains information of a special kind in relation to this country which cannot be obtained elsewhere. Dr. Chevers, by his uniformly courteous, attractive, and genial manners, had formed a large circle of friends, both European and Native, in Calcutta, who, while regretting his departure from amongst them, still wish him the full enjoyment of many happy years of his well-earned repose at home, where no doubt he will be found foremost in the ranks of the profession whose honor and interests he held so dear. Surgeon-Major S. B. Partridge, Professor of Surgery in the Medical College and ex officio first Surgeon in the Medical College Hospital, and Surgeon-Major J. Ewart, M.D., Superintend- ent of the Presidency General Hospital, left Calcutta on furlough to England with Dr. Chevers, and were succeeded by Surgeons-Major E. J. Gayer and J. Elliot, M.D., respectively. Working of the hospitals has been eminently successful. 31. In conclusion, it is clear that the working of the Calcutta medical institutions during the year 1876 has been eminently successful, and that the satisfactory result has been obtained chiefly through the diligence, zeal, and ability with which the medical officers con- cerned have performed their responsible (in some cases very onerous) duties. Explanation of the delay in submitting this report. 32. I regret that I have been unable to submit this report on an earlier date, owing, in the first instance, to the delay there was in forwarding the returns and reports of certain institutions to my office; and afterwards to the necessity there was for returning some of them for correction. The same causes have led to its rather hurried compilation; however, I trust that in it and in the summary reports of the various hospitals full information has been afforded on all points connected with the working of the Calcutta medical institutions and of the great amount of medical and surgical relief afforded in them to the sick poor of Calcutta and its suburbs, which it may be the desire of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor to be made acquainted with.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 13 Statement No. VII14 REPORT ON THE Statistics. 2. The statistics in connection with the in-door patients, Christian and Native, treated in this hospital during 1876 are very clearly shown in the following tables:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 of total treated. This rate, in the case of Christians, is higher than it was in any one of the preceding five years, when it was 5.91, 6.18, 5.95, 5.67, and 5.58 respectively, and no explanation has been given on this point. The death-rate of Natives was somewhat higher than it was in 1874 and three preceding years, but was under that of 1875, as well as of the average of the preceding quinquennial period. 6. Dr. Smith states that of the 520 patients who died in hospital, 139, or 26.73 per cent., were "moribunds" on admission. This is a large proportion of such cases, and if they were excluded, the death-rate would have been 10.35 per cent of total treated, instead of 13.61, as stated in the preceding paragraph, or against 12.84 per cent. (with a similar deduction) in 1875. This point will be again referred to in paragraph 11. Moribunds. 7. In the Eye Infirmary there were 534 patients treated. Of these 79 per cent. were males, 19 per cent. were females, and 2 per cent. were children. The new admissions amounted to 493, which was exactly the same number shown in 1875. Of the total number treated, 311, or 58.23 per cent., were cured. No deaths occurred in this department of the hospital. Eye Infirmary. 8. The total number of in-door patients treated in this hospital during 1876 has therefore been (Christians 1,795, Natives 2,557) 4,352, or less by 104 than the total number treated in 1875. Total number treated less than in 1875. 9. In the following table those diseases are shown which were the more common causes of mortality amongst the Christian patients, as also the proportion of deaths from them of the numbers treated and to the total mortality:16 REPORT ON THE considering the class of the patients, and those of them who were brought to hospital in a moribund condition, such a result will not be wondered at. Moribund patients. 11. It has been stated, in paragraph 6 of this summary, that 139 patients were moribund on admission into hospital. Of these, 33 were Christians and 106 were Natives. The following table shows the diseases the moribund patients were suffering from on admission, and it will be understood that, in the case of cholera, moribund patients died within six hours; in cases of poisoning by opium, within half an hour; and in all other cases, within 24 hours of admission.

During the year under report (exclusive of operations in the Eye Infirmary) 151 were performed, giving a total of 168. Of these, 53 per cent. recovered; 3 per cent. were relieved; 1 per cent, was discharged unrelieved; 24 per cent. died; and 19 per cent. remained under treatment at the end of the year. The percentages just given are shown as whole numbers, but the actual death-rate of the year was 23.80 per cent. of cases operated on. The mortality after operations during the preceding septennial period was 22.72, 19.75, 25.92, 17.06, 15.57, 20.70, and 20 respectively. Of the total number operated on, only 136 were treated to a termination, and amongst these the proportion of deaths was 29.41 per cent. In the ophthalmic hospital, 212 operations were performed, and of them no fewer than 158 were cases of extraction of the lens. Including those remaining from 1875, there were altogether 172 of these cases; and in 124, or 72 per cent. of the total number in which the lens was extracted, the patients were discharged cured. Exemption from deaths due to hospitalism. 13. Amongst the causes assigned for the deaths of the 40 patients after operation, it is very satisfactory to observe that erysipelas and pyæmia were each accountable for one death only. This is a point well worthy of close attention; as in 1875, of the patients operated on, three died from septicæmia, three from erysipelas, and two from pyæmia, or at the rate of 25.80 per cent., and the average mortality for the six preceding years, which was assigned to hospitalism, was 31.06 per cent. No explanation has been offered for this exemption after operations of fatal cases due to hospitalism. Obstetric wards. 14. The number of patients (including children up to seven years of age) treated in the obstetric wards was 1,035, against 993, 1,004, 943, 1,063, 745, and 747 in the preceding six years. Of the total number treated 10.33 per cent. were Europeans or Americans, 32.07 per cent. were East Indians, 35.26 per cent. were Natives, and 22.31 per cent. con- sisted of children of all classes. The mortality was at the rate of 8.88 per cent. (against 6.44, 7.17, 7.31, 6.58, 8.05. and 7.49 per cent. in each of the six years immediately pre- ceding), and was divided amongst the several classes as follows, viz., 4.67 per cent. of Europeans and Americans, 3.61 per cent. of East Indians, 9.04 per cent. of Natives, and 18.18 per cent. of children. Confinements. 15. During the year 250 women were delivered in hospital, and this number shows a steady and progressive increase as compared with previous years. The numbers confined in the preceding sexennial period were 230, 226, 216, 191, 146, and 139 respectively. Of the total number of women delivered, 8 per cent. were Europeans and Armenians, 30 per cent. were East Indians, and 62 per cent. were Natives. Medical and surgical out-door dispensaries. Treated in the ailmission-room. 16. Out-door patients. CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 17. The number of minor operations performed by the Resident Surgeon was 3,617 18 REPORT ON THE devotedness' and gentle disposition of Mrs. Coreya, the nurse of my own European male ward. I have no doubt that the officers of the hospital staff could, if necessary, from direct knowledge, speak with equal praise of other nurses of the institution. It is further right to add that, in my opinion, we, the Members of the College Hospital staff, are greatly indebted to the ladies of the Nurses' Committee for their most disinterested services in connection with the hospital. No one can more fully appreciate, than I do, the broad charity and kindness by which they are actuated, and I most confidently affirm (and it affords me much pleasure to do so) that the interest which they are good enough to take in the supervision of our nurses is produc- tive of signal benefit to the public." Income and expenditure 28. The income of the hospital for the year 1876, derived from all sources, was Rs. 2,26,973-4-3, and the expenditure, exclusive of the cost of Europe medicines supplied by Government which the Officiating Principal (in his letter No. 147, of the 16th April 1877, to the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Presidency Circle,) states that he was unable to supply, amounted to Rs. 1,18,080-7-2, so that there was a balance in hand to the credit of the hospital, on the 31st December 1876, of Rs. 1,08,892-13.1. This account of income and expenditure will be shown in detail along with that of the other Calcutta medical institutions in statement No. II of the Appendix. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. Superintendent. SURGEON-MAJOR J. ELLIOT, M.D., by whom the Annual Report has been submitted, assumed the superintendence of this hospital on the 31st March 1876, vice Surgeon-Major J. Ewart, M.D., who proceeded to England on 19 months' furlough. Statistics. 2. From the following table an accurate idea can be obtained of the principal statistical events in connection with the in-door department of this hospital during the past year:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 daily average sick amounted to 182.25. Dr. Elliot also states that "notwithstanding an absence of epidemic disease from Calcutta and its Suburbs during the year, there has been an excess of admissions during the past over any preceding year on record, attended with a decided decrease in the rate of mortality."

Dr. Elliot, in his memorandum No. 326, of the 26th January 1877, to the address of the Deputy Surgeon-General, Presidency Circle, reports as follows regarding moribund patients:20 REPORT ON THE Localities from which cholera cases were admitted. 8. The following were the chief sources from which cholera cases (Europeans only) were received for treatment, and the information afforded in the report for 1875 is also given for sake of comparison:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 14. In the following table those diseases are shown which were the principal causes of sickness and mortality amongst the Native in-door patients, as well as the deaths per cent. of treated, and of the total mortality which occurred from them:22 REPORT ON THE of food as there is in having it properly cooked and served in a palatable form to the sick. Even under the strictest system of scrutiny and check it often happens that miscarriage and mistakes occur when least expected. An attempt has been made to improve matters by concentrating the responsibility and appointing a head cook on a higher salary than was formerly given. The system is not at present working smoothly, and there remains much to be done towards the improvement of this important branch. The connection of the drains with the municipal sewers. Condition of the hospital road and, grounds. Erection of the railing round the hospital grounds. 20. Regarding the connecting of the hospital bath-rooms, &c., with the municipal drains, Dr. Elliot reports as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 THE CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. Superintendence. THIS hospital has been under the superintendence of Dr. Woodford during the past year, and the following summary has been compiled from the annual report submitted by him. Statistics. 2. The following table exhibits the principal statistical events of 1876 in connection with the working of the institution in its in-door department only, as out-door patients are not treated at it:24 REPORT ON THE Death-rate according to race. 8. The death-rate according to the race of the patients (including moribund cases) was as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 These men have no legal right to this path, and I would submit that this decision be asked at the hands of the Court, or the bustee purchased by Government as recommended by the Commission convened by orders of Government in June 1875, as the present state of things is prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and discipline." Hospital building. 15. In regard to the hospital building, Dr. Woodford reports as follows on what he considers to be existing defects in it:26 REPORT ON THE The buildings are in good order, except that the roof of the main building leaks a good deal, and in consequence the patients are often put to great discomfort. To remedy this, as well as to render the building cooler during the hot season, it has been proposed to put an inner wooden roof beneath the corrugated iron one, and it is, no doubt, very desirable that this should be carried out. Glass sashes in the window spaces in place of the present venetians, and wooden panel doors, would also be a great improvement both for the comfort of the patients and better lighting. It is also very desirable that gas should be laid on for lighting the extensive compound as well as for use in the wards. Dr. Woodford very justly complains of the annoyance that exists in the inhabitants of a village close to the south wall having the right of way through the compound; and it is greatly to be hoped that measures will be taken to stop the nuisance, for as long as it exists the authorities of the hospital can have no proper command over their own premises." The Deputy Surgeon-General visited the hospital several times during the past year, and "on all occasions found the wards and every part of the premises clean and tidy, the patients well cared for, and all the duties of the hospital satisfactorily conducted."

WOODFORD prefaces his report of the Police Chowkeedar Hospital for 1876, of which the following is a brief summary, with this remark, viz.27 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS System of under-feeding. services would be a tedious and difficult task, as the men of the native army garrison stations situated in Bengal, the North-Western Provinces, Oudh, the Punjab, and in Central India. Some of the regiments are stationed permanently along the north-east and north-west frontiers, and the native army generally has to serve in some stations of well-known unhealthiness, in which the meteorological and other well-recognized sanitary conditions are widely different from what they are in Calcutta. The higher admission and sick rate of the native army is probably the result of the order by which every man unfit for duty is shown as a patient in hospital, and the higher death-rate in the police force may be due to the fact that (quoting Dr. Woodford's remarks) "the police chowkeedar's daily average of duty being from 8 to 10 hours, he is exposed to all the changes of climate and season." Perhaps, too, the system of under-feeding (alluded to in paragraph 14 of this summary), while it doubtless lessens the power of resisting disease, may at the same time tend to cause a fatal termination of many diseases whose course in more healthy subjects would be towards recovery. Statistics of admissions and deaths from fever, &c. 8. The following table exhibits the rate per cent. of the total admissions and deaths caused by some of the diseases which were more commonly met with:28 REPORT ON THE From the foregoing it appears that the divisions stationed in the town and suburbs contributed the greatest proportion of the admissions and deaths; but in last year's report it was remarked that the highest mortality was from the Hooghly bridge and suburban divisions. Inefficiency caused by under-feeding. 14. Regarding under-feeding, and the consequent inefficiency produced by it, Dr. Woodford remarks as follows, viz.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 29 Statistics. 3. The statistics of the hospital for the past year are clearly shown in the following table:30 REPORT ON THE also 37 minor operations performed. Regarding this fatal case, the Assistant-Surgeon writes as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 31 4. Some of the more interesting statistics of the sickness and mortality of the in-door patients according to caste and sex are shown in the following table:32 REPORT ON THE highly disturbing influence on the death-rates of both hospitals; and excluding it from the statistics, the mortality of the Mayo Hospital will fall from 133CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 33 recovered; while of 8 amputations on account of injury (arm 2, fore-arm 2, leg 3, and toe 1), 3 proved fatal, or at the rate of 3734 REPORT ON THE Statistics. 2. An accurate idea of the principal statistical events of the year in connection with the working of the in and out-door departments (Christian and Native) of the institution is conveyed in the following tables:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 35 5. It will be remarked that there has been an increase in the number of patients, Chris- tians as well as Natives, during the year. The increase of the in and out-door patients from the former class was 28 and 196 respectively, against the figures of 1875, and the increase of Native patients was 71 and 268 above that of the same year. Dr. Bird remarks that "a greater number of patients were treated during the past year than in any other since the foundation of the institution. This, however, is not altogether a matter for unmixed congratulation. The resources at the disposal of the committee are limited, so also are the energies of the establishment and the space included in the wards. On the other hand, the hospital wants of the Native poor in and around Howrah are, comparatively speaking, bound- less, consequently the hospital authorities must sometimes sacrifice the efficiency of the insti- tution to their laudable desire to be humane." Increase of patients. Admissions and mortality of Christians from some of the more common diseases. 6. The following table exhibits the total number of Christian patients (European and Eurasian) treated for certain diseases, and the mortality and death-rates from each. For the sake of comparison the corresponding statistics of 1875 are also given:36 REPORT ON THE Remittent fever. 11. Regarding the prevalence and severity of cases of remittent fever, Dr. Bird writes that "in the past year the type of remittent ever in Howrah was more virulent than that which characterized the disease in 1875, and the mortality was larger in the former year than in the latter. The same treatment was followed in both years. This consisted of the æther mixture, rum and ammonia, and occasionally Warburgh's tincture. The latter- mentioned remedy is the best of all, and comes very nearly to being a specific for the disease. With abundance of this drug at hand, the medical man may confidently count on a successful result in almost every case, provided the patient comes under his care not later than the 7th day of the fever." The mortality from remittent fever during 1876 was at the rate of 210.5 per mille of Christians and 267.3 Natives, against 68.18 and 194.76 in 1875. When the mortality from cholera was excessive, that from fever was moderate, and vice versâ. 12. The figures in the two preceding tables reveal another remarkable fact, which is that when the mortality from cholera was at a high rate among the Christian and Native patients, that from fever was moderate, and vice versâ. This extraordinary fluctuation in the severity of these two diseases is not easily accounted for, nor has any explanation been offered regarding it. Dysentery. 13. Dr. Bird observes that "dysentery was, on the whole, less prevalent in 1876 than in 1875, but the mortality among the Native patients was excessive. This was owing to many of the dysenteric cases being received in a moribund state." Among the Christian patients 38 cases of dysentery were treated without the occurrence of a casualty, but among the Native patients the mortality from this disease was at the rate of 382.71 per mille of total treated. Residences of cholera patients. 14. In the following tables are shown the residences and number of the cholera patients admitted into the European and Native wards of the Howrah General Hospital during the ear 1876:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 37 the temporary latrines and bath-rooms were placed, has been cleaned, covered with cement, and made available as a promenade for the patients, while almost the whole of the commodes formerly in use have been discarded. As a consequence of this, the general appearance of the wards has been rendered much more tidy, and the atmosphere more pleasant and whole- some. In the new latrine, the 'dry earth' is in successful operation. During the year the hospital building and out-houses were put in thorough repair." It is very satisfactory to notice that the bath-rooms and latrine arrangements, which were reported on in preceding years as being "as objectionable as can well be imagined," have been done away with, and that the new and approved ones, which were under construction, have been completed and brought into use. Such an essential improvement in the sanitary condition of the hospital will, it may be confidently predicted, add considerably to the comfort of the patients and will ensure them a purer atmosphere than they could have enjoyed while the bath-rooms and latrines existed in their former and highly objectionable positions with reference to the wards occupied by them. 18. Regarding his medical subordinates and hospital establishment, Dr. Bird reports as follows:38 REPORT ON THE BHOWANIPORE DISPENSARY. History of the dispensary. THIS institution was opened in 1840, for the treatment of in and out-door patients. In 1873 the in-door department was transferred to the General Hospital, where it is now known as the Sumboo Nath Pundit Ward. Medical officer. 2. Assistant-Surgeon Ram Chunder Sen was in charge of the dispensary (for out- patients only) up to the 23rd of December 1876, on which date he made it over to Assistant. Surgeon Bany Madub Tagore; and the institution, in addition to being occasionally visited by Dr. French, Civil Surgeon of the 24-Pergunnahs, was officially inspected by him on the 6th June and 30th December 1876. Building. 3. During the past year the dispensary was located in a hired house at Churrukdanga, a place considered to be much too near to the Russapugla institution, and too far from Bhowanipore. A new building on the northern side of the municipal tank at Bhowanipore was constructed during the year, and will soon (the report was written in February) be ready for occupation. The Civil-Surgeon of the 24-Pergunnahs considers the site for the new dispensary building to be well chosen. The furniture is said to be ample for all requirements, and to be in fair condition. Statistics. 4. The following statement shows the amount of relief afforded in 1876, and the same statistics of the year 1875 are given for sake of comparison:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 39 THE ALIPORE DISPENSARY. ASSISTANT-SURGEON CHUNDER SEKUR HALDAR has been in medical charge during the past year, and ever since the institution was opened in 1852. Regarding the Assistant- Surgeon's professional qualifications, the Civil Surgeon of the 24 Pergunnahs reports as follows:40 REPORT ON THE Decrease in number of in-door patients. Mortality. Causes of deaths. Death-rates from cholera and remittent fever. 5. There has also been a decrease in the number of new in-door patients admitted into the dispensary, as compared with 1876, by 11. During the year 15 in-door patients died, so that the mortality was at the rate of 13.63 per cent. of total treated. This death-rate, though doubtless a high one, shows a very marked and satisfactory improvement on that of 1875, which was 31.92 per cent. Of the 15 deaths in hospital, seven were from cholera, three from remittent fever, one from dysentery, one from peritonitis, one from poisoning by opium, one from injury, and one from carbuncle. The mortality from cholera was at the rate of 58.33 per cent. of cases treated, and from remittent fever at the rate of 25.00 per cent. Operations. 6. There were four major operations (one an impacted calculus removed from the urethra and three dislocations reduced) and 263 minor, against, in 1875, major operations none and 258 minor ones. Receipts and expenditure. 7. The year opened with a balance in hand of Rs. 497-1-11; during the year Rs. 2,909-6-0 were received from Government, and Rs. 70 in subscriptions and donations from Europeans: making a total of Rs. 3,476-7-11. The expenditure of the year amounted to Rs. 2,984-8-11, so that on the 31st December there was a balance in favour of the dispensary of Rs 491-15-0. Remarks recorded by the Deputy Surgeon-General. 8. The Deputy Surgeon-General visited the dispensary on the 13th January 1876, and recorded the following remarks:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 41 8. The Deputy Surgeon of the Presidency Circle inspected the dispensary in company with Dr. French on the 27th of December, at the working hour, and he reports that he found the duties being satisfactorily carried on by the Native doctor. Medicines were sufficient in quantity and properly kept. Books were carefully written and up to date. "A. verandah," Mr. Cockburn writes, "for the use of the patients waiting to be attended to is very much required, especially during the rainy season. This was suggested at last year's inspection, but nothing has been done." Remarks by the Deputy Surgeon- General. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. THE Honorary Secretary has been good enough to send me a copy of the report on the working of this institution during the past year, and I am sure the opinion of Drs. Smith and Elliot recorded in it will be accepted as satisfactory evidence of the good work which has been accomplished through its agency in the wards of the Presidency General and Medical College Hospitals. As the report is a short one, and the subject of hospital nursing is one of special interest to many, I reproduce it in extenso. "In publishing the report of the 17th year of this institution, the Committee have much pleasure in being able to state that the nurses employed by them to work in both the Medical College Hospital and the General Hospital have given satisfaction to the medical officers, and that the matrons of both hospitals have done their work with their usual zeal and efficiency. "In his letter to the Honorary Secretary, Dr. Smith, Principal of the Medical College and First Physician to the Medical College Hospital, writes:42 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA LOCK-HOSPITALS. THROUGH the courtesy of Dr. Payne, Superintendent of Lock-hospitals, I am enabled to give a summary of his interesting report on the working of the Contagious Diseases' Act (XIV of 1868) in the town and suburbs of Calcutta during the year 1876. Number of registered prostitutes. 2. At the end of December 1875, 7,925 women were borne on the register, but in January 1876 this number had fallen to 7,490. An increase took place in the succeeding months, so that the year closed with a total of 8,241, or with 316 in excess of that just shown as remaining at the end of 1875. The increase of' registered prostitutes during the past year has been steady and progressive, but, as remarked in my last report, was not accompanied by a corresponding addition to the number of those who attended the periodical medical examinations, and it would therefore appear that the benefit derivable from the detection of disease in its earliest stages had not been thoroughly realized. Number of defaulters at the periodical examination. 3. The number of those women who failed to attend the periodical examinations was smallest in January, but increased steadily during the following months, with the exception of June, when there was a slight decrease in the number of defaulters. During the month of January there were 9.3 per cent. of defaulters, and this number gradually increased up to 18.4 per cent. in December. Regarding this very marked increase in the number of those absenting themselves from the periodical examinations, Dr. Payne does not offer any explana- tion, but merely remarks as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 43 cent of the latter. These figures, while disclosing the vast amount of disease which must generally exist amongst the unregistered prostitutes, convey but a very slight idea of the extent of the misery, or of the numbers of the male population who must become permanently disabled by syphilis, aided, as it frequently is, by the improper treatment prescribed in the bazars, and should impress on all concerned the urgent necessity there is of working this section of the public health to the fullest extent sanctioned by the Contagious Diseases' Act. Regarding the facts conveyed in the preceding table, Dr. Payne remarks as follows:44 REPORT ON THE the proportion of cases brought on the list and inspected for the first time is much greater than that of the class under regular control. During the year there were newly registered 913 women, and among them 266 were found to be diseased. In 1876, as in 1875, the increase has fallen on the minor affections. Under every heading but that of "simple ulcer," that is, under any disease due to contagion, the number of admissions has fallen. The fall is particularly striking in the instance of infecting syphilis. Although the quantity of hard chancre admitted in 1875 was itself much less than in former years, that of 1876 is less than a quarter of the former, and presents a figure which must be considered remarkably small in so large a collection of venereal cases." "In soft chancre also a great reduction is noted. Here no doubt some variation will be due to nomenclature. Diagnosis is now made by the same medical officer and on an uniform system, whereas formerly differences arose from accepting the names assigned separately by each of three examiners. Never- theless, in females, the line between a soft chancre and a simple ulcer is not very clear; and though such want of definition will not account for so large a difference as the tables present, some allowance should be made for it. Owing to want of accommodation, gonorrhCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 45 18. The following was the expenditure on account of the Lock-hospital and examin- ation depôts during the year 1876:APPENDIX.

The statement showing the race and sex of all the persons treated has in this report been submitted for the first time in a complete form, the regis- tration of all out-door patients at the General Hospital having been properly attended to:( 3 ) cold season to discuss the means by which the Fort drains can be connected with the municipal sewers. The scheme submitted has met with Mr. Eden's approval, and he has asked the Government of India to have this important work carried out as soon as possible. 5. The statement of the principal diseases from which in-door patients suffered shows some increase in enteric fever. The disease, however, appears to have been of a comparatively mild type. One-half of the sufferers treated were Europeans, and 14 out of the 22 native patients were constables. No less than 11 of these 14 cases ended fatally. It does not, however, appear that this result is due to specially defective sanitary arrangements in the police hospital or the thanas. In all, 669 important surgical operations were performed, with only 74 deaths. The operations on the eye were especially successful, only one out of 223 ending fatally. Mr. Eden is glad to learn that out of 40 deaths which followed operations at the Medical College Hospital, only two can be attributed to hospitalism. This is a great improvement on previous years, when this affection was so prevalent as to suggest a radical defect in the construction of the hospital building. It only shows how wrong it is hastily to condemn the construction of a hospital by the results of a single year. 6. The total amount disbursed on account of these institutions during the year was Rs. 5,07,473, against Rs. 4,88,835 in 1875. Of this increase, the General Hospital is responsible for Rs. 33,223. A part of this sum is repre- sented by Rs. 18,768 for medicines and books supplied by Government. There was no corresponding entry in the accounts for 1875, and the circumstances under which this heavy charge has been incurred have not been explained. It is doubtless to some extent attributable to the undue extension of the out-door department, to which allusion has already been made. But the Lieutenant- Governor sees too much reason to believe that there is a great deal of waste and pilfering of expensive drugs in all Government hospitals and institutions. There is also an unexplained increase of Rs. 9,598 in the charges for dieting the sick, and of Rs. 3,427 under the head "Miscellaneous." In the accounts of the Mayo Hospital, as in those of the General Hospital, a charge for medicines and books supplied by Government appears for the first time. The expenditure under this head was Rs. 6,000. There is also an entry of Rs. 4,013 for dieting the sick, to which nothing in the statement for the previous year corresponds. Altogether, the charges of this hospital for 1876 amounted to Rs. 59,175, exceeding those for 1875 by Rs. 8,414. In view of the circumstance that there was a falling off of 4,075 in the number of persons treated, the Lieutenant-Governor cannot but consider this increase in expenditure unsatisfactory. In the report for 1874, the Surgeon-General estimated the permanent annual expenditure, exclusive of repairs, at Rs. 48,000. That this estimate was not unduly low was shown by the results of 1875, when, excluding expenditure on repairs, the gross disbursements were only Rs. 47,349. After deducting the charge on account of repairs, however, the expenditure for the past year is found to have been Rs. 6,861 over the estimate of 1874. The Campbell Hospital shows a decrease in the gross charges from Rs. 78,793 to Rs. 75,241. The number of persons treated, all in-door patients, was 6,640, against 7,782 in the previous year. Although the number of patients was so much smaller, there was actually an increase in the amount expended on bazar medicines, and on wine and spirits, and a large increase in the wages of servants; while the decrease in the cost of dieting the sick does not at all correspond with the falling off in the number of patients. The Lieutenant-Governor has recently found it necessary to appoint a com- mittee to report on the expenditure of this hospital. The Sumbhoo Nath Pundit Dispensary, which has been deprived of many patients by the General Hospital, is the only institution which shows money invested during the year out of surplus income. The financial management of the Howrah Hospital has been successful. Though there was an increase in the number of sick, the
( 4 ) charges for dieting, for medical comforts, and for "miscellaneous charges" show a decrease; while the increase in the gross expenditure is due to expendi- ture on repairs. This hospital receives no medicines free from Government; yet its expenditure is well within its income. Mr. Eden has very strong grounds for believing that the expenditure on European medicines and medical comforts in most of the Calcutta hospitals is excessive, and that charges are thrown upon Government which, by careful management and a proper con- trol of issues, might be avoided. 7. The Lieutenant-Governor cordially endorses the encomium passed by Dr. Beatson upon the ladies of the Nurses' Committee, and the lady nurses of the Canning Home. Careful and gentle nursing is often of more importance than expensive medicines, and the ladies who devote their time to the support and superintendence of this good work deserve the gratitude of Government and of the public. 8.

The Lieutenant-Governor desires to tender his acknowledgments to Dr. Beatson for his full and excellent report, and for the personal interest with which he has supervised the general management of the hospitals. Dr. Cockburn's inspections have been careful and efficient. Drs. Elliot, Bird, Smith, and Cayley have the satisfaction of knowing that their labours to render the hospitals under their charge worthy of the confidence of the public have been eminently successful.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1877. No. 562 B.G. FROM THE OFFICIATING SURGEON-GENERAL FOR BENGAL, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 2nd August 1878. 1st, Medical College Hospital; 2nd, Presidency General Hospital; 3rd, Campbell Hospital; 4th, Police Chow- keedar Hospital; 5th, Mayo Hospital and its associated Dispensaries; 6th, North Suburban Hospital; 7th, the Alipore Dispensary; 8th, Bhowanipore Dispensary; 9th, Arratoon Apcar Dis- pensary; 10th, the Calcutta Nurses' Institution; 11th, Howrah General Hospital, and 12th, the Calcutta Lock- hospitals. SIR, IN submitting a report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1877, I have the honor to say that those which are noted on the margin are included, and that the arrangement which has hitherto been follower will be adhered to. Numbers, attended both in-door and outdoor. 2. Statement No. I shows the number of house and out-door patients treated during the year in the City and Suburban Hospitals of Calcutta. Comparing these numbers with those of the precede- ing year, it may be stated generally that the numbers show an increase. Thus in the Medical College Hospital there were 4,352 house and 44,679 out-door patients in 1876, against 4,967 and 47,506 in 1877. In the General Hospital also there was an increase, as also in the Mayo and Campbell Hospitals. An increase of house-patients from 2,261 to 2,859 likewise occurred among the police force, from which latter fact it seems natural to infer that the past year was more unhealthy than 1876. Among the five suburban dispensaries, the total number of patients which was 42,102 in 1876 rose to 47,855 in 1877. It is further to be noticed that the number of patients treated in 1876 was less than in 1875.

It always seems to me that to compare the death rates of any hospitals, except military hospitals, is of very little use, as the results are very misleading if it is taken for granted that he smallest mortality indicates the most successful treatment. In military life all men unfit for duty are supposed to be, and as a general rule are, in hospital, and thus they must come early under treatment. It is the same in every regiment and detachment; but into civil hospital, patients, for whom they are intended and who ought to go, are not compelled to do so, and too often they stay out too long and apply for admission when treat- ment is likely to be of little service. This is especially the case in India. From the statement it appears that the mortality per 1,000 varied from 44.3 in the General Hospital to 108.3 in the Medical College. Among the police it was 22.0. In the Mayo Hospital 120.3, and in the Campbell, to which many mori- bund cases are sent, 248.3. The rates per mille for the Calcutta hospitals for 1877 was 127.9, against 172.08 in 1876. In the suburban dispensaries it was 167.7 in 1877, against 166.2 in 1876. Sex and race of all the patients treated. 4. Statement No. II, which follows, shows the sex and race of all the patients treated during the year:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 6. The following statement (No. III) exhibits the number of cases treated and the mortality in all the hospitals of Calcutta and its suburbs for the past ten years, indicating also the death-rate from cholera, and contrasting the hospital with the municipality returns. In certain years the hospital mortality from all diseases has been a very little lower than in 1877, viz. in 1871 and 1872 when it was 132 per mille, but in all the other seven years it was greater and in some very considerably so. The average annual hospital death-rate from 1868 to 1876 was 154. In 1877 it was 133. The mean annual rate of mortality among cases of cholera treated in the hospitals of Calcutta from 1868 to 1876 was 488 per 1,000; in 1877 it was 512. The annual report of Health Officer of Calcutta shows that the death-rate from cholera among the general population of the town was 3.3 per mille, while for the nine preceding years the average death-rate from cholera was 4.3 per mille:4 REPORT ON THE STATEMENT DISEASES MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

6 REPORT ON THE Moribund cases. 9. The following table shows the actual number of moribund cases admitted, and the effect which these cases have had on the general rate of mortality:7 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. STATEMENT NO. VII8 REPORT ON THE It thus appears that the operations performed in 1877 contrast favourably with those of the previous year, both in the way of numbers and success. In 1876 there were 669 operations which hitherto have been classified in these reports as "More important," with 74 deaths, or at the rate of 11.06 per cent. of the cases operated on. In 1877 there were 916 operations of the same class with 77 deaths. or at the rate of 8.4 per cent. Income and expenditure. 13. A statement of the income and expenditure of the Calcutta Medical Institutions is subjoined, but it is by no means accurate or complete. For example, the prices of Government medicines and books and forms used has not been obtainable in most instances. In order to secure more reliable information as to the price of medicines used during the current year, I propose to have a regular price list printed and a copy sent to each Medical Officer, so that he may return the actual cost of all stores used. Hitherto when the prices of medicines have appeared in dispensary or hospital returns the quantities used have not been put down, but simply the cost of the quantity issued from the Medical Stores during the financial year ending 31st March, although the reports are for the year ending 31st December previously. I endeavoured to obtain an estimate of the cost of medicines used during the past financial year, but was not able to get it. I have said that the table of expendi- ture is inaccurate, and by way of example shall take the Medical College Hospital. For this the expenditure on account of establishment is returned as Rs. 44,698-7; but this does not represent nearly the whole establishment, as the pay of the Physicians and Surgeons is omitted. Were their pay included, the cost of establishment would rise from Rs. 44,698 to something like Rs. 1,45,998, or over that sum. Establishment. The expenditure on account of establishment as returned from the General Hospital, viz. Rs. 65,865, includes the pay of Superintendent and all other charges under each head. I had intended to compare the average cost of each patient in the various hospitals under the head of establishment, medicines, miscellaneous charges, &c., but under the circumstances above detailed in reference to the Medical College Hospital this cannot be done. I consider, however, that it would be very desirable if these particulars were shown, and I shall endeavour to exhibit them in the report for the current year if I have to write it. I shall, however, quote the average cost of each patient in the General Hospital from which I have received an account including all charges.

10 REPORT ON THE Defects in the several hospitals. Medical College. Presidency General Hospital. Campbell Hospital. Howrah General Hospital. 14. It may be well here to call attention to the defects in the various hospitals which have been brought to notice by the medical officers in charge. In the Medical College Hospital a separate ward for contagious diseases removed from the main building is much wanted, as also a new out-door dispensary; but this latter want will soon be supplied through the liberality of the late Baboo Chonee Lal Seal who left money for the purpose. Better quarters for the nurses are being provided. The latrines in this hospital are very objectionable, and seem to me to demand speedy attention. In the Presidency General Hospital the latrines are likewise very unsuitable, and are, I consider, a source of danger to the patients. Better lavatories are also needed. Quarters for nurses are in course of erection. A separate ward for children is a desideratum, and Dr. Raye has proposed that the quarters now occupied by nurses should, when no longer wanted, be made available for children. The quarters of the medical subordinates are exceedingly bad, and their condition has apparently very frequently been brought to notice. The roof of the Campbell Hospital is much in need of repair. In the rains it leaks all over, and according to estimate it will require Rs. 16,000 to make the roof water-tight. It would be an immense advantage if this hospital could be thoroughly walled in. At present, there are several paths through the grounds so that thefts are more easy. There are also some minor defects of drainage to which the attention of the Public Works Department has been called by Dr. Mackenzie. If the native ward of the Howrah General Hospital could be given up for Europeans and other accommodation found for natives, this would be of great advantage. Sometime ago it was proposed to give part of the old jail for a native ward, but I have not heard what has been done in this matter, though I believe a part of the money required has been got together. Calcutta Nurses' Institution. 15. In the summary of reports which follow will be found in extenso the report of the Calcutta Nurses' Institution for the year 1877, and it will be noticed that Dr. Raye in his report of the General Hospital speaks favourably of the assistance they have been of in that institution, especially in the cholera wards. Dr. Coates also writes as follows "our hospital staff has worked well and the nurses have done admirable service." Remarks on pecuniary aid from suburban municipalities. 16. I beg to invite attention to Dr. Mackenzie's remarks in which he asks for pecuniary aid for the Campbell Hospital from the suburban munici- pality which send their sick freely to this hospital yet do not contribute to its funds. It seems to me that he has made out a case which would justify the demand for some consideration from this municipality. In like manner as cases of small-pox occurring among the shipping are never refused, it does not seem unreasonable to propose that the hospital should receive a contribution from the Port Dues Hospital Fund. Then, in reference to the Howrah General Hospital, native sick are received there in whatever stage of disease they may be, chiefly from the suburbs. It is surely not too much to ask that in return the Suburban Municipality should at least remit the house-tax now charged on the hospital. Were there no hospital, the Commissioners would be compelled to arrange for the treatment of their sick poor elsewhere. Mixed cinchona. 17. Assistant Surgeon Ram Chunder Sen, of the Bhowanipore Dispensary, records his opinion regarding Mixed Cinchona Alkaloids as a remedy for periodic fevers. It appears that he does not approve of the remedy. Dr. French, however, has formed a different opinion, and so it will be observed have Dr. Raye, of the General Hospital, Mr. Pilcher, of Howrah, and in fact the general opinion of most medical men who have made trial of the remedy, is so much in its favour that it is hardly worth while to notice observations which have probably been made on hasty generalization or imperfect trials. The introduction of the Rungbee Febrifuge has been a most fortunate circumstance for Government, as it has so greatly curtailed the expenditure of the expensive sulphate of quinine. The only fear is that the supply may fall short, as it is understood that the present process does not thoroughly extract the bark of its ingredients. Machinery is wanted in order to do this more thoroughly. I beg to call attention to the remarks of Mr. Pilcher regarding Ixora, a new remedy for dysentery introduced by Assistant Surgeon Amirto Lall Deb. Remarks on compounders. 18. Mr. Pilcher suggests that compounders should be regularly trained to their duties, and put in a better position as regards pay and pension. This
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 proposal is a good one and well worthy of consideration. As a general rule they are very ignorant, as well as careless in duty, and totally unfit to handle dangerous medicines. Below I append a memorandum showing the dates on which the various reports and returns reached this office, so that it may appear how I was unable previously to submit the general report of the whole.

"There were seven European and two native erysipelas admission cases during the year, one in each of the Physician's, one in the midwifery, and three in each of the Surgeon's wards. It is well worth remark that in no instance did these infect other patients. This is a very strong proof of the healthy quality of our hospital air, notwithstanding all that has been said about faulty construction. A fact of this nature is to me of greater value by far than the wrong going of cases after serious injuries or after severe surgical operations, many of which would become septic in the open air itself, and which it would be a simple absurdity to charge against hospital construction, though this has been too often done." Dr. Palmer strongly insists on this point. He writesCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 Causes of death in the 39 fatal cases which include seven of liver abscess.

What follows is quoted verbatim from Dr. Coates's report. MAJOR AND MINOR OPERATIONS. Ophthalmic Hospital. In the Ophthalmic Hospital 21 cases were under treatment at the end of the year 1876. During the year under report 216 operations were performed, giving a total of 237. Of these, 158 were cured, 26 relieved, 37 unrelieved, and 16 remained under treatment. Major and minor operations. Ophthalmic Hospital Dispensary for Women and Children. The number of women and children who came for treatment was 14,309, against 13,703, 15,463, 15,217, 13,766, and 11,892 in the five preceding years. The minor operations performed were 440, against 440, 361, 390, 421, 512, and 229 in the six preceding years. Ophthalmic Dispensary. In the Ophthalmic Dispensary there were 3,483 males, 1,052 females, and 929 children treated, or a total number of 5,464 new patients. Ophthalmic Dispensary. The daily average attendance at this dispensary was 78.72 persons. The following table shows the relief rendered by this dispensary during the past six years:16 REPORT ON THE show an increase of 3,607 over the returns of 1876, which is accounted for by 1,416 more patients in the medical and 2,191 in the surgical out-door depart- ment. The number of patients who attended the out-door dispensaries in the preceding five years was 18,537, 18,833, 21,889, 24,758, and 24,644. In addition to the above out door patients treated in these dispensaries, 1,027 cases were treated in the admission room, and 2,096 patients of a slightly better class were prescribed for by the Resident Physician and Surgeon in the consult- ing room. The Resident Surgeon performed 5,585 minor operations, which shows an increase of 1,968 over 1876. The numbers of minor operations performed in the six preceding years were 3,617, 2,705, 1,476, 1,553, 1,301, and 1,348 respectively. Comparing these figures with the numbers of patients who have attended the surgical dispansary during the same period, it will be seen that the increase in the number of operations is out of proportion to the increase in the number of patients. The explanation of this is that the dispensary is now a purely surgical one, much greater care having been taken of later years than formerly to exclude all cases not surgical in the strictest sense of the term. The Resident Surgeon has also endeavoured during the past four years to exclude from the benefits of the dispensary, all patients able to pay for advice, or who were at the same time attending other dispensaries. It is a common practice here, just as it is at home, for well-to-do persons to try to get an opinion gratis in the out-door departments of our large hospitals, and it is also very common to find in Calcutta, as in London and other large towns in England, patients who are attending the out-door department of one institution, seeking opinions and medicine at the same time in the out-door departments of other institutions. Both these evils have now been pretty completely checked, and though their suppression for a time tended to diminish the numbers attending the dispensary, there is no doubt it will ulti- mately increase its popularity. Dental Dispensary. Dental dispensary. There were 3,954 patients treated during the year under report, against 3,442, 1,828, 850, 1,047, 1,184, and 4,542 during the six previous years. The number of operations performed was 3,534. Total Dispensary Practice. Total dispensary practice. The following table shows the relief rendered to out-door patients during the past five years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 The former diets had the disadvantage of allowing unlimited extras to the strong and vigorous. This has been put a stop to; no extras whatever are now allowed to those on full, or half, or ordinary milk diets, but where the weak and the specially diseased require a special diet, a separate one is freely given them. The washing and cooking will have our attention in turn. The issue of medicines and the expenditure of dressings, bandages, &c., has been watched with good results. Many old instruments have been returned into store; and our hospital has been weeded of its incurables to some extent. The hospital requirement is a place for the segregation of contagious or septic cases. This it is proposed to accomplish by building a new mid- wifery hospital on adjoining land, and utilizing the empty wards for this purpose. A new Out-door Dispensary. This we expect to accomplish owing to the generosity of the late Baboo Chuni Lal Seal, who has left Rs. 62,000 for the purpose under certain condi- tions, which are now under the consideration of Government. Better quarters for our Nurses. This subject also is before Government, and plans for a new building have been sanctioned. Financial. The following savings were effected during the year from our budget grant:18 REPORT ON THE establishment during the past year, though, he adds, he has done his utmost to furnish him with all information contained in the office and has materially aided in drawing up the report. It is further added that written records of several minor details in connec- tion with the management of the institution are wanting, which Dr. Elliot, had he lived, would have been in a position to have furnished. "I have, however, (he adds) attempted to fill in as many of them as I was personally acquainted with, and have endeavoured to give expression to such of his opinions regard- ing the general history of the year and personnel of the establishment as I was aware of. To the best of my belief no opinions have been expressed which would not have been shared in by him." Chages in the staff. 3. During the year the following change occurred among the Medical Officers of the HospitalCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 From the above table it appears that, not only has there been a large increase in the total number of seamen treated, but also that, notwithstanding a simultaneous increase in the male patients of other classes, the proportion of seamen to the total number of males received into the European wards has also been much greater than in previous years. Of the 4,613 patients treated in the European wards, 187 died, or 40.5 per 1,000 treated, the average rate for ten years previous having been 51.17 per mille. 5. Among 531 patients treated in Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's ward, 41 deaths occurred, or 77.2 per 1,000 treated. This large mortality is no doubt owing to the number of patients who came into hospital in an advanced state of disease, as a last resource after all other modes of treatment had been tried. In the European wards 155 men, 14 women, and 18 children died; in Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's ward 39 men, 1 woman, and 1 child. Patients treated at Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's ward. 6. Dr. Raye gives the following table showing the results of the year 1877 contrasted with the previous one in reference to some of the most common diseases:20 REPORT ON THE The arrangement for a separate establishment of nurses for the cholera ward has been most beneficial, and has greatly conduced to the well-being of the patients. The improvement which has taken place in this direction, since the setting apart of a proper staff of nurses, with all necessary appliances, has been most marked. In last year's report the late Dr. Elliot drew attention to the urgent necessity of having speedy means of transport provided for conveying sailors to the hospital in order, if possible, to have them placed under treatment before their disease had time to get utterly beyond control. The matter was then under consideration, and during the year arrangements have it is understood, been made for stationing three doolies along the river bank at convenient sites. Private charity has also established a dooly which has already done good work. This dooly is supported by voluntary contributions, chiefly, it is believed, from the shipping community. Dysentery. 10. During the year 370 cases of dysentery occurredCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 During the year 137 major operations were performed with eight deaths. Of these, 90 took place in the European, and 47 in the native ward, with eight in the out-patients room. There were six deaths among European and two among native patients operated on. The cause of death was exhaustion in five cases, phthisis in one, lockjaw in one, and disease of the kidneys in a case of lithotomy. Erysipelas made its appearance on different occasions, but by segregation its spread was checked. It is difficult to account for its occasional occurrence, as the wards are always clean and well ventilated, and the hospital is in a healthy situation. Operations. There were 635 minor operations, none of which led to fatal results. There were 48 midwifery cases during the year, being ten more than in the previous year. Forty of the cases were natural, two required instruments, five were abortions, and in one premature labour was induced. Of the mothers 17 were Europeans, 27 Eurasians, and four natives. Twenty male and 23 female infants were born; only one, a male infant, was still-born. The lying-in-room has been under Mrs. Hickey, who is well acquainted with her duties as midwife. Midwifery. 12. The sanctioned diet scale has been in use during the year, and the food on the whole has been of good quality and fairly well cooked. Diet scale. Considerable improvement has taken place in the preparation of the food for the patients; but owing to the extent of the ground covered by the hospital buildings and to the distance of the cook-room from them, it is not an easy matter to serve up the diets as nicely as could be desired. Some arrangement for heating small articles of food, cups of soup, &c., is much needed in the day time. At night when the gas is turned on, there is no difficulty in doing this, but in the day time the gas is shut off. A small cooking apparatus with a spirit lamp in the nurse's room of each ward would answer the purpose; it could be placed in charge of the nurse on duty, and should not be very expensive. 13. The total cost of dieting during the year was as follows:22 REPORT ON THE The cost per bed was thereforeCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 outlay would be necessary for small cots, and some extra nurses would be needed probably. The medical subordinates' quarters remain in the unsatisfactory condition noticed in last year's report. Quarters of medical subordinates. Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's ward. 17. The Native or Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's ward was opened on the 12th August 1873. The following table shows the number treated since then:24 REPORT ON THE of .22 per cent. from the previous year. This death-rate, when compared with that of other hospitals, is very high. The reason of this is that in the other hospitals only picked cases likely to live are kept, and all those in a low or dying condition are transferred to this institution. Period of death among patients after admission. The following table shows the period of death after admission of all the cases which succumbed during the year:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 "The following table shows the various diets of this hospital:26 REPORT ON THE "Of the Rs. 70,485-3-8 expended during the year, Rs. 30,000 was paid by the Calcutta Municipality, leaving the sum of Rs. 40,485-3-8 to be paid by the Government. Suggestions. "As a large number of pauper patients belonging to the suburbs of Calcutta and the 24-Pergunnahs, as well as all the small-pox cases from the suburbs of Calcutta, the 24-Pergunnahs, Howrah, and the Port of Calcutta are admitted into this hospital, I would suggest that the municipalities of the suburbs and of Howrah be each invited to give an annual donation to this hospital, and that a portion of the present hospital port dues be transferred to defray the expenses of the hospital. "Although, as above mentioned, the expenditure of the hospital is to so considerable an extent caused for providing for the sick of the suburbs, the Municipality nevertheless charge a heavy house-tax on the institution. This, I have no doubt, would willingly be remitted were the matter brought to the notice of the Suburban Municipal Commissioners." POLICE CHOWKEEDAR HOSPITAL. Police Surgeon and subordinate staff. THE report for the past year is submitted by Surgeon S. C. Mackenzie, who has had to trust entirely to the records of the hospital, as he did not receive charge till the 2nd January of the current year, Dr. C. T. O. Woodford having held the post of Police Surgeon throughout 1877. The subordinate staff consisted of a resident medical officer, Mr. McCormick, a retired military apothecary; two native doctors, two compounders, and a dresser. Admissions into Hospital. 2. The admissions during the year show an increase of 190.58 per mille over those of the previous year. In 1876 a strength of 3,122 men fur- nished 2,107 admissions or 674.88 per mille; in 1877 a strength of 3,159 men furnished 2,734 admissions, or 865.46 per mille. Sickness according to thanas. 3. The following table shows the admissions into hospital during the year from the various thanas:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 27 5. The following table shows the diseases on account of which the mor- tality of the last two years occurred:28 REPORT ON THE The hospital during the months of August, September, November, and December was overcrowded. The largest number of cases in hospital on any given day was 238 on the 9th December: the smallest number 69 on the 17th March and 1st June. The average number during the year was 124.93. The hospital buildings need repair. A good deal of the sand-plaster on the walls of the verandah has worn off. The inside of each ward needs to be properly whitewashed. Drainage. 7. The drainage of the grounds slopes westward, running into the kutcha surface drains, which communicate with the municipal sewers. It would be better if the present kutcha drains could be converted into pucca ones. Latrine. 8. The latrines are in connection with the town sewers, and are always kept clean by a plentiful supply of water. The pucca houses which are situated north of the hospital seem to pass their night-soil into a surface drain on that side of the building; this should be prevented at once on sanitary grounds. This matter has had attention since Dr. Mackenzie's report was written. Diets. 9. The following table shows the various diet-scales for the sickin hos- pital, together with the extras which it was found necessary to give the men when the diets were insufficient:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 29 3. The causes of sickness and the resulting mortality can be seen from the following table30 REPORT ON THE The following table exhibits the results of the year as regards house- patients in the Mayo and Chandney Hospitals in contrast with those of 1876:31 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 1877, the deaths having been 64 in 1876 and 77 in 1877.

The total number of in-patients at the Mayo Hospital, when compared with the figures for the previous year, shows an increase of 142, the admissions in 1876 being 1,679 against 1,821 in 1877. At the Chandney Hospital there were 306 admissions, falling short of the number for the previous year, when there were 350, by 44.

The hospital buildings and out-houses are reported as in a good state of repair. The flooring, however, is much cut up at the entrances, and requires to be laid with common chunar stone, which would make the place look neat and tend to the comfort of the sick by allaying the dust. Sickness. 3. The aggregate sickness of both in-door and out-door patients can be seen from the following table, which also exhibits the ratio of deaths to treated among Europeans, Eurasians, and Natives. The number of house- patients on the European side has been greater than in any former year:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS 35 With reference to the above statistics, Mr. Pilcher is of opinion that the figures do not give a casual observer a very accurate idea of the sickness and mortality of the district or of those admitted into hospital, as the cases received are generally in a very impoverished condition of health, and resort to the hospital as a last resource. Diarrh36 REPORT ON THE have had their resources so crippled by the long sickness of one of their num- bers that the burden can no longer be borne, and the invalid is brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease to avoid the expenses of cremation or burial. "The foregoing table shows the number of persons regarding whom there was but small hope of recovery on their admission and who are here shown as 'moribunds.' The official definition of the 'moribunds' has its use no doubt, but it does not include one half of the cases that may be considered dying on admission. "At present there is no special provision for the accommodation of this class, and. the small out-house in the hospital enclosure, devoted to moribunds, is always overcrowded. An appeal is being made to the public for funds to provide additional accommodation for the native department of the hospital generally, and claims for this class will not be overlooked." Operations. 7. The operations performed in this hospital during the year show 54 major with eight deaths, and 1,346 minor operations with no fatal cases. The chief operations have been amputations of various limbs, which operation was rendered necessary from railway accidents. The mortality was heavy though perhaps to be expected from the nature of the injuries which required surgical interference. During the year seven European and one native woman were confined. The filtered water supplied to Calcutta has been used for drinking and cooking purposes. The drainage is satisfactory. Sewage is disposed of under municipal regulations, so also is conservancy, and the arrangement is said to be working well though expensive. The new latrine, urinals, and bath-rooms are a great improvement in the European portion of the hospital, being conveniently placed in a detached building which is reached by a covered way. The native latrine is kept in good order. "The compounders have not given satisfaction. They are a class of men about which there is very general complaint. It would be a benefit to the province, or at any rate to the larger hospitals of the province, if these men were taught their duties and placed in a better position with regard to pay and pension." Remedies. 8. In reference to remedies Mr. Pilcher writes as follows:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 37 9.

The total number of patients who sought aid from this dispensary during the year was 7,465, against 6,240 in 1876 and 9,527 in 1875. The daily average attendance during 1877 was 67.4, 52.8 during 1876 and 93.02 during 1875. Considering the superior attractions of the out-door department at the General Hospital close by, the Superintendent thinks the result for 1877 very satisfactory, and further expects the daily attendance to increase considerably during the current year. There is now no out-door department at the General Hospital. 4. The following seem to have been the most prevalent diseases which were treated at the dispensary: Fevers, 2,449; rheumatic affections, 315; respiratory affections, 345; diarrhCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 39 3.

The quantity of infecting syphilis in 1877 was nominal; that of soft chancre less than half the quantity of the previous year; and the other serious affections fell largely. "I have given much attention to the remarks made by the Surgeon- General last year respecting the method of returning cases of simple ulcer; but I submit that the return cannot be complete if they be excluded. These ulcers arise in the exercise of the women's calling, though they do not follow specific infection. Many, probably most, of them become soft chancres if not promptly treated. Indeed, the line is often difficult to draw when the cases present themselves. They cannot be returned in any other place if they are causes of detention, as they must be, nor can the working of the inspection system be represented without them, therefore I have ventured to include them in this return as in former years.

It appears from this statement that the general increase in the number of patients noticed above extended to those of every race, except the small body of persons classified under the head 'Other castes.' Of the total number treated, 59.94 per cent. were males, 15.29 per cent. females, and 24.76 per cent. children. The low proportion of females to males among Hindoo and Mahomedan patients noticed and explained in last year's Resolution was this year particularly marked. Although, as compared with 1876, there was an increase of 2,194 in the number of Mohamedan males treated, there was a decrease of 453 in the number of Mahomedan females; the Hindoo adult male patients increased by 4,428, and the children by 3,575; while the Hindoo female patients increased by only 935. From a comparative statement given in the report, it appears that the total proportion of adult female patients to males and children was lower in 1877 than in any of the previous four years. 5. The following table shows the health of the town and suburbs during the past ten years, as exhibited in the hospital returns:( 3 ) examined by a Committee which has been sitting in Calcutta during the present. year. Their report will enable the Government to carry out many reforms and to check the lavish waste which has characterized the expenditure of several of the hospitals in late years. The total amount entered as disbursed during the year was Rs. 5,09,804, against Rs. 5,07,473 in 1876; but in the statement of expenditure for 1877 the cost of European medicines used in the Medical College Hospital has been omitted, although included in the statement for 1876, while an entry under this head is made against the Campbell Hospital in the statement for 1877, though not made in the statement for 1876. In the expenditure of the General Hospital there was an increase of Rs. 37,709 above that of the previous year, and Rs. 33,366 of this increase is classed under the head 'Miscellaneous charges.' Some explanation should have been submitted of the increase in the expenditure under this head which is entirely out of proportion to the increase in the number of patients treated. The Municipal Police Hospital showed an increase in expenditure approximately propor- tional to the increase in the number of patients treated, while there was a decrease of expenditure in the Medical College, Campbell, North Subur- ban and Howrah Hospitals, notwithstanding that the number of patients treated at each of them was greater in 1877 than in 1876. It is a remarkable fact that though in the Medical College Hospital there were 615 more in-door patients treated than in the previous year, the expenditure on diet and wines was less by Rs. 1,506. The increased expenditure of the Mayo Hospital is almost entirely under the head 'Repairs and construction of buildings,' and the large amount entered in 1876 under the same head against the Sumbhoonath Pundit's Dispensary accounts for the decrease in the expenditure on that institution in the past year. Considering the increase in the number of patients treated at the several institutions, the expenditure of the past year compares on the whole favourably with that of 1876. The Lieutenant-Governor is much surprised at finding that the accounts of the income and expenditure of the different medical institutions have hitherto been furnished in such an extremely incom- plete and inaccurate form, as to render any comparison of the expenditure of the different hospitals under each head impossible. The question of the preparation of uniform returns and forms of account for all hospitals is under the consideration of the Committee on medical expenditure, and need not be further referred to here. 10. The subscriptions to the various medical institutions amounted during the year to Rs. 35,075, against Rs. 11,201 in 1876. Subscriptions to the amount of Rs. 26,093 were received for the Howrah Hospital alone in 1877. The only institution that invested any surplus income during the year was the Aratoon Apcar Dispensary. 11. Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution.( 4 ) cases the patients died. The deaths from septicæmia were eight, or 25 per cent. of the total deaths from operations. It is, however, by no means clear that even most of these deaths were due to hospitalism, and it appears to be conclusively shown that in many cases in which deaths have hitherto been attributed to hospitalism, mortification had set in and blood-poisoning declared itself some days before the patients were admitted to the hospital. Dr. MacConnell, the resident physician, has traced out the 30 septic( 5 ) cinchona alkaloids given with ether have yielded better results than were formerly obtained with quinine. Nearly one-fourth of the deaths in the European wards of the General Hospital resulted from cholera; 43 out of 73 cases ending fatally. Of the 73 cases 65 were received direct from the shipping. Of 18 cases of typhoid fever, 16 were from the shipping. The number of cases of sunstroke was nearly double the average of the past ten years, and of the 20 cases admitted there were six deaths. Many of the cases were of a very severe type, the sufferers being almost moribund on admission. During the year an operating theatre and a lying-in-room were added to the hospital building and both are now in use. The Lieutenant-Governor also sanctioned the erection of new quarters for the nurses and the work was begun before the close of the year. The department of the Sumbhoonath Pundit's Ward for out-door patients was abolished on the 31st December, and as the cost of the ward was found to be out of all proportion to its usefulness, the Lieutenant-Governor has recently ordered it to be altogether closed. 14. Campbell Hospital.( 6 ) Howrah Hospital, and both Dr. Bird and Dr. Pilcher consider it of very great value. The Lieutenant-Governor understands that a separate report on the subject will shortly be submitted for the information of Government. Dr. Pilcher also writes in high terms of the Assistant-Surgeon's diligence and attentions to his hospital duties. It is mainly owing to his zeal and kindliness of manner that the number of out-patients has so largely increased during the last two years. 17. Other Institutions.( 7 ) No. 3365.

2 REPORT ON THE Taking the hospitals of Calcutta proper, including the Medical College, General Hospital, Mayo Hospital and Dispensaries, Campbell and Police Hospitals, we find that the number of house-patients had increased by 3,902, while the out-door patients had diminished by 18,034. This no doubt was caused by the closing of the out-door department of the Presidency General Hospital, at which were treated 20,248 out-patients in 1877. The rate of mortality in these hospitals was notably higher in 1878 than in 1877, having been 149.9 per mille in the former, and 127.9 in the latter year; but it was much below the death-rate of 1876, which was 172 per thousand treated. Looking at the Howrah General and the Suburban Hospitals and Dispen- saries, we have a decrease of 53 house-patients and an increase of 10,109 out door patients. The rate of mortality was 220.8 per thousand in 1878, 'against 167.7 in 1877 and 162.2 in 1876. Taking all the medical institutions of Calcutta and its suburbs, the general result for the year is an increase of 3,849 in-door patients and a decrease of 7,925 out-door patients in 1878 as compared with 1877. The total death-rate was 157.8 per thousand last year, against 133.2 the year before. The following scheme exhibits the increase and decrease of patients treated in the Calcutta hospitals during the past six years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 5.

Statement No. IV gives a general idea of the tables of mortality, contrasting the results of last year with those of ten previous years, distin- guishing the mortality from cholera, and showing also the number of deaths registered by the municipality and the death-rate of the town calculated on the population of Calcutta. The average annual hospital death-rate from all diseases for the ten years from 1868 to 1877 has been 152.1 per thousand, so that last year it was very considerably in excess of that rate, having been 160. In 1877 it was 133. The average rate of mortality in the town for the above ten years has been 27.9. In 1878 it is said to have been 38.1. The mean annual death-rate of cholera cases treated in the hospitals of Calcutta from 1868 to 1877 has been 490.8. Last year it was 555 per Dille. It will further be observed from the statement that the rate of mortality from cholera has gradually been increasing in the hospitals of Calcutta year after year since 1873. STATEMENT No. IV. YEARS.

9 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The following differences in the amount of money invested by different hospitals in 1878, as compared with 1877, are to be noticed. On the 1st Janu- ary 1877 the Medical College Hospital had Rs. 1,00,900 and interest during that year, which amounted to Rs. 2,635, against Rs. 1,07,400 on 1st January 1878, which yielded Rs. 2,702-12-9 during that year. The Mayo Hospital accounts show on 1st January 1877 invested funds Rs. 6,33,102-7-2, and the interest during the year was Rs. 17,420. On the 1st January 1878 Rs. 3,22,400 are returned as invested capital, and the interest during the year is entered as Rs. 17,974-7-10. It appears that in 1877 the value of the build- ing had been shown in the annual account as invested capital, but this was incorrect, and for last year the sum of Rs. 3,10,702 has been struck out, being the value of the hospital building. The North Suburban Hospital returns Rs. 1,691-12-3 as invested on the 1st of January 1877, and the same sum on the same date in 1878, but in neither year is interest said to have been received. To the credit of Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's dispensary on the 1st January 1877 there stood a sum of Rs. 1,505-5-6 as invested, but no interest appears to have been drawn during the year. On the 1st January 1878 the sum invested was Rs. 2,100, and the interest received during the year Rs. 113-1-5. Alipore Dispensary returned in the annual report for 1877 Rs. 491-15 as invested on the 1st January, but no interest as accruing during the year, and Rs. 415-8-8 as remaining invested on the 31st December 1877. On the 1st January 1878 the sum invested is entered as Rs. 424-13-6, and the interest for the year as Rs. 71-4-8. Arratoon Apcar Dispensary invested Rs. 466-14-9 during 1877, which sum appears on the 1st January 1878, but apparently no interest was obtained. Howrah General Hospital has Rs. 14,900 invested, which yields an annual income of Rs. 633-8. It seems to me that the statement which is ordered to be submitted for the purpose of showing the financial position of medical institutions and dispensaries is defective, inasmuch as it does not show the amount " withdrawn from invested capital, although it has an entry showing the amount invested."

In 1878 native subscriptions exceeded those of the previous year by Rs. 10,534-9-9. The heading " salaries received from Government " in the instance of the Presidency General Hospital represents the whole of the money received for the medical officers and all others concerned. In the case of the Medical College Hospital the salaries of the medical officers are not included. In the General Hospital Rs. 65,865 were received from Government on account of salaries in 1877, against Rs. 55,165 in 1878. The salaries drawn from Govern- ment on account of the Medical College Hospital amounted to Rs. 44,698 in 1877 and to Rs. 42,453 in 1878. The expenditure at the Campbell Hospital on account of establishment in 1877 was Rs. 22,772, against Rs. 26,498 in 1878. Bazaar medicines in 1877 cost Rs. 4,546 and in 1878 Rs. 2,905. Diet charges in 1877 amounted to Rs. 28,859 and in 1878 to Rs. 23,876. Miscel- laneous charges, Rs. 9,066 in 1877 and Rs. 5,760 in 1878. I tabulate a comparison of the expenditure of the various hospitals and dispensaries in 1877 and 1878, omitting fractions and money invested. Expended on- Medical College Hospital. General Hospital.

Each patient treated cost on an average for everything except medicines, the account of which I have been unable to obtain, Rs. 1-4-2 in 1878 and Rs. 1-10-3 in 1877.* In the suburban hospitals the expenditure was less in 1878 by Rs. 7,121, and each patient cost in 1878 Rs. 0-12-6, against Rs. 1-1-7 in 1877. Taking both city and suburban hospitals, the average cost per patient was Rs. 1-2-10 in 1878 against Rs. 1-9-D in 1877. The average cost of each diet for Europeans in the Medical College Hos- pital was 6 annas, in the General Hospital 7 annas 6 pies, in the Howrah Hospital 9 annas 4 pies. For natives it was in the Medical College 3 annas 8 pies, in the General Hospital 3 annas 5 pies, in the Howrah Hospital 1 anna 7 pies, Mayo 2 annas 2 pies, Campbell 2 annas 6 pies, Police 2 annas 10 pies, North Suburban 1 anna 10 pies, Alipore 1 anna 10 pies. The average for European diets has been 7 annas 7 pies and for native diets 2 annas 6 pies. There is, however, reason to believe that these averages are not strictly correct, inasmuch as patients who paid for their own food were in some instances accounted for as having been fed out of hospital funds. This practice I desire to put a stop to, and to exclude the patients fed by their friends, or who buy their own food, in calculating the average cost of each diet. In accordance with the Resolution of the Government of Bengal on the Report on the Calcutta Hospitals by a Committee appointed to enquire into Medical Expenditure in Bengal, dated 25th January 1879, the maximum limit for the diet of Europeans and Indians, inclusive of all extras and stimulants, has been now fixed at 8 annas for the former and 3½ annas for the latter. Time will show whether these rates will prove sufficient after a fair trial11 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. mortality might not be reduced by a more liberal use of generous soups, milk, stimulants, and other kinds of food suitable for the wretched creatures who at present die so freely. At the beginning of the year it was brought to notice by the Surgeons of the Medical College Hospital that the operating theatre was very badly lighted, when Government sanctioned alterations in the gas-burners, which have proved a great success, so that there is now good light when operations are necessary at night. The new out-door dispensary in connection with the Medical College Hospital, which is to be erected out of money left by the late Baboo Chooni Lall Seal, has not yet been commenced, though there is every hope that it may soon be so as the plans are now ready. The building will cost about Rs. 12,000, and there is also a sum of Rs. 50,000 which is to be invested for the mainte- nance of the institution. It is also arranged that there shall be separate wards for the treatment in the Medical College Hospital of cases of delirium tremens occurring among seamen and others, the funds being provided out of the hospital dues of the Port Fund. For the Medical College Hospital a separate contagious ward has been sanctioned, as also quarters for the nurses. A new obstetric hospital has been sanctioned; but, so far as I know, nothing more has been done regarding it. Government has sanctioned the expenditure of Rs. 10,000 out of the Port Dues Hospital Fund by the Committee of the Howrah General Hospital with the object of providing fifteen additional beds for seamen. The Committee intend to remove the native wards from the present building, as also the present store-room, and to convert these into wards for sailors. They have collected a considerable sum of money and intend to construct a separate native hospital. According to the plan, it will be rather an imposing structure which they hope to build. Some improvements have been made in the Presidency General Hospital during the year. More seats have been purchased for the benefit of the patients strolling in the grounds of the hospital, and better accommodation has been provided for paying patients, for whom the upper floor of the main block of buildings has been reserved. By this means it is hoped that a superior sort of patients, by whom a higher board will be paid, will be attracted to the hospital. Quarters for the nurses, costing a large sum of money, have been finished, and are now in occupation. A very salutary order has been passed by His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in reference to over- crowding in the Campbell Hospital, which has accommodation for 467 patients. It was found, however, that in November and December 1878 the daily average number of patients was 522, and on the 25th November there were actually 605 inmates. Sir A. Eden has ordered that in future, when the hospital has its full complement of patients, the Superintendent should give notice to the other hospitals from whom he is in the way of receiving patients of his inability to admit fresh cases. He is, however, directed to continue to receive cases sent by the police. In this hospital, where the mortality has always been high, and where the vitality of very many of the patients is very low, anything like overcrowding must undoubtedly tend to increase a death-rate already excessive. The drainage of the ground surrounding the Campbell Hospital has been improved at a sanctioned expenditure of Rs. 691. This was greatly needed, as water used to lodge in the rains. A great want of Calcutta is a better small-pox hospital than at present exists, especially for Europeans. There is one at the Campbell Hospital, but it is not large enough. The sheds at this hospital for natives affected by the same disease answer very well. Some improvements were in contemplation and will be carried out as funds become available, among which may be mentioned better latrines for the General Hospital and Medical College Hospital. A new office, store-room, and dispensary, together with quarters for the Deputy Superintendent, are much wanted in the Campbell Hospital. Plans and estimates have been prepared, which it is hoped will shortly be carried out. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant. JAS. IRVING, M.D., Surgeon-General of Bengal.

From the above it will be seen that this disease was present during the whole year; that it was most prevalent during the months of February, March, and April, when the admissions were 14, 17, and 25 cases. The smallest number of cases were admitted during May, when only one was brought to hospital. Of the 117 patients admitted during the year with this disease, 78 or 66.66 per cent. died.

Of the Rs. 68-6-6, which appears for advertising for contracts during the year, Rs. 35-1-9 was for advertisements inserted during the previous year and not paid until this year. I understand that the hospital records and books were bound during 1877, but I am unable to state under what head they were charged, as there is no record in the office to show it.

This large decrease in the death-rate is probably due to the fact that all the old and inefficient men were got rid of during the year, and their places were filled up with a carefully-selected class of recruits.

The admissions of European patients were less than in the previous years, and was pur- posely so owing to the want of space. Many cases of no great urgency had to be refused admissions. The patients admitted were employés of the British India Steam Navigation Company, East Indian Railway, other public Companies, seamen, and paupers. The out-patients came from Howrah chiefly, but not a few from Calcutta. It is gratifying to report that the native out-patients' department continues to attract large numbers of sick. This is largely due to the attention of Assistant Surgeon Umirto Lall Deb. The aggregate sickness and mortality in the European and native departments, in-door and out-door, during the past as compared with the preceding three years is indicated. EUROPEANS AND EURASIANS.

The year was a sickly one, not only was there an unusual prevalence of fever, but it was of severe and fatal type. This is seen, not only by the hospital returns, but by the evidence of practitioners in the various parts of the town. Cholera appears also to have been severe in type, and bowel-complaints were unusually prevalent. The causes of death amongst European and Eurasian patients during the year 1878 are stated in the subjoined table:28 REPORT ON THE Dysentery.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 29 Cholera does not appear to have been confined to any one part of the European quarter of the town, but to have occurred here and there. There were four admissions from ships at the Calcutta moorings. The months of greatest prevalence of cholera were March, April, and December. Water-supply.30 REPORT ON THE BHOWANIPORE DISPENSARY.

The building is in excellent repair and there is ample furniture. The Dispensary Com- mittee met twice, viz. on the 15th July and 6th November. During the year 12,802 cases were treated, chiefly of fever, rheumatism, syphilis, dysentery, diarrh31 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. ARRATOON APCAR DISPENSARY, GARDEN REACH. THIS is a dispensary which only receives out-door patients. It was established in 1870 by Mr. Seth T. Apcar, who entirely supports it. It is classified as of Class III, Grade 3. Civil Hospital Assistant Pran Kisto Mookerjee has held charge during the year. The build- ing is in good repair. The Committee met twice during the year. The number of patients treated amounted to 12,142, that is to say, 11,321 attended in person and 821 represented by friends. The average daily attendance was 127.3. It is said that in 1877 only 9,508 cases were treated, so that there was an increase of 2,634. The closing of the out-door department of the General Hospital probably accounted for part of these increased numbers. The commonest diseases are malarious fever, enlarged spleen, bowel-complaints, bronchitis, and skin diseases. The total cash expenditure for the year amounted to Rs. 1,265. Govern- ment contributed Rs. 180 as half-pay of the hospital assistant, and also furnished Europe medicines, which are valued at Rs. 374-7. Mr. Apcar contributed Rs. 900. The Civil Surgeon visited the dispensary six times during the year. CALCUTTA HOSPITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION, WITH WHICH IS AMALGAMATED THE LADY CANNING HOME. THROUGH the kindness of Mrs. J. A. Wilson, Honorary Treasurer of the above institution, I have been supplied with a copy of the report for the year 1878, which is as follows. This institution, which has just completed the 19th year of its existence, has from a very small beginning now attained its object of having one of its nurses in constant attend- ance on the sick in each ward of the two leading hospitals in Calcutta. The Committee, in issuing their report for the past year, have the satisfaction to record the testimony of the Principal of the Medical College and of the Surgeon Superintendent of the General Hospital to the gradually increasing efficiency to the staff of nurses, to their attention to duty, and their kindness to the sick. The leading event of the past year has been the inauguration of the scheme of out- nursing, to accomplish which was the main object of the amalgamation of the Lady Canning Home with the Hospital Nurses' Institution. A new building, adjoining the residence of the lady-nurses and within the precincts of the General Hospital, has been erected for the accommodation conjointly of the hospital nurses and of the Canning out-nurses. The building was opened on the 16th December 1878 by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, when His Honor the Lieutenant- Governor of Bengal and other trustees of the Canning Home and Members of Committee were present. The Committee of Management have great pleasure in announcing that six nurses are now available at the General Hospital for out-nursing, under the immediate direction of the Lady Superintendent of the Canning Home. In all the arrangements for starting the Canning out-nurses, and in the preparation of the new quarters for the reception of the hospital nurses, the Committee have the pleasure to acknowledge the ready assistance afforded by the present Lady Superintendent, Miss Best. Many applications having been made for out-nurses some time in anticipation of the formal opening of that department of the institution, the Committee sanctioned these being granted, so far as the Lady Superintendent was prepared with suitable nurses. From the experience thus gained, and the now constant demand for the services of the nurses, the Committee are led confidently to look forward to the out-nursing department becoming self-supporting. But, in the meantime, it adds considerably to the expenses of the institu- tion, and any addition to the large sum which has to be collected by the Committee32 REPORT ON THE Treasurer's Statement of Account for the year 1878.

MEDICAL. Darjeeling, the 11th July 1879. READ( 2 ) It appears from this statement that, notwithstanding the general decrease in the number of patients, there was an increase of 2,377 in the number of Mahomedans treated, and of 2,247 in the number of persons classed as of 'Other castes.' Of the total number treated, 62.13 per cent. were adult males, 14.42 per cent. adult females, and 23.44 per cent. children, the proportion of adult males being higher and of adult females lower than in any of the previous five years. While there was an increase of 4,613 in the number of adult Mahomedan male patients and of 718 in the number of adult Hindu male patients, there was a fall of 368 in the number of adult Mahomedan female patients and of 2,908 in the number of adult Hindu female patients. 4. The following table shows the health of the town and suburbs during 1878 and the previous ten years, as exhibited in the hospital returns:( 3 ) 6. The statement of the income and expenditure of the different insti- tutions is defective in the same respect as that for the previous year, the Surgeon- General having been unable as yet to ascertain from the Medical Examiner the cost of European medicines and instruments supplied during the year to each hospital and dispensary. Excluding this item, and also the salaries of the medical officers attached to the Medical College Hospital, it appears that the total amount disbursed during the year was Rs. 3,65,497, against a correspond- ing expenditure of Rs. 4,83,973 in 1877, and this saving of more than a lakh of rupees in a single year was effected, notwithstanding that there was an increase of 3,849 or 15 per cent. in the number of in-door patients. Although the total cost of medical stores in each of the two years is not given in the report, the Surgeon-General states that he is certain that the expenditure on account of instruments and medicines was less during the past year than in previous years. The cost of European as well as of bazar medicines is given for the General, Mayo, and Police Hospitals, and the figures fully bear out Dr. Irving's statement. The actual cost of medicines for the General Hospital cannot, on account of the closing of the out-door dispensary, be usefully compared with the cost in 1877; but in the Mayo Hospital the expenditure for European and bazar medicines was Rs. 7,922 against Rs. 8,743 in 1877, while in the Police Hospital the expenditure was Rs. 1,067 against Rs, 2,194, although in each of these institutions the number of patients in 1878 exceeded the number in 1877. Turning to the items of expenditure for which complete figures are given, it appears that there was a reduction under every head. The cost of establishments was less by Rs. 6,225 than in 1877, but this decrease is partly accidental and will not occur again; the expenditure on bazar medicines was Rs. 9,189 against Rs. 10,395, and the outlay on buildings and repairs was Rs. 18,679 against Rs. 27,955 in the previous year. The principal heads, however, under which the large saving noticed above was effected were 'Miscellaneous charges' and 'Diet.' Under the former head there was a decrease in expenditure of Rs. 59,177, and under the latter of Rs. 42,593, notwithstanding that there was, as already stated, an increase of 15 per cent. in the number of in-door patients treated. In the Resolution recorded by the Lieutenant-Governor on the 25th Janu- ary of the present year on the report of the Committee appointed to enquire into Medical Expenditure in Bengal, the maximum limit for the diet of Europeans and natives, inclusive of extras and stimulants, was fixed at eight annas for the former and three and a half annas for the latter. The actual cost of diets during the past year in the different hospitals appears to show conclu- sively that these limits afford an ample margin for any extras that the medical officers may consider it necessary or even desirable to give. In the Medical College Hospital the average cost of each diet for Europeans was six annas, in the General Hospital seven annas and six pies, and in the Howrah Hospital nine annas and four pies. For natives it was in the Medical College three annas eight pies, in the General Hospital three annas five pies, in the Howrah Hospital one anna seven pies, in the Mayo Hospital two annas two pies, in the Campbell Hospital two annas six pies, and in the Police Hospital two annas ten pies. In the North Suburban Hospital and in the Alipore Dispensary the cost was one anna ten pies. Taking all the institutions together, the average cost of European diets was seven annas seven pies and of native diets two annas six pies. 7. Dr. Irving, in referring to the efforts that have been made during the past year under the Lieutenant-Governor's orders to put some check on the excessive expenditure of former years, has thought proper to designate the year as one of "rigid economy" during which "the screw was continuously applied for the purpose of reducing expenditure in all possible ways." Dr. Irving, however, will no doubt on reflection admit that these loose and careless expressions do not in any way represent the real policy of Government, which has been repeatedly explained. The policy of Government has been to secure to the sick under treatment proper food, comforts, and medicines, and to check the malpractices which are now admitted to have existed by all except those who were directly or indirectly responsible for the state of things under which, while the sick were deprived of the medicines and comforts ordered for them, the tax-payers of India were defrauded of large
( 4 ) sums of money. The policy of Government has been simply and solely directed against waste, and the results described in the report show how enormous the waste has been. That many persons must have suffered pecuniarily by the check on waste is obvious enough, and it is of course their interest to misrepresent as far as possible the action of Government, and to maintain an agitation in the hope of producing a return to the former state of things; and this last object they have systematically endeavoured to gain by the odious accusa- tion that the sick in hospital were stinted in the medicines and diet necessary to their health. That such persons should act in this way was of course all along expected, but from responsible Government officers of position a more judicial analysis of facts may reasonably be expected. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that Dr. Irving may not have intended that his words should convey the meaning which they obviously bear, and this seems the more probable, because the figures he himself gives support inferences the very reverse of those which would be naturally drawn from his remarks. The policy of Government, the Lieutenant- Governor is satisfied, was not by any one so misunderstood or perverted as Dr. Irving's words imply, nor is there, the Lieutenant-Governor believes, a single medical officer among those whose practice is thus impugned, who would admit that his patients were left without anything that could be really beneficial or useful to them. Dr. Irving is not without experience of these matters, and had he desired to make an impartial examination of the events of 1878 in the Campbell Hospital, he could not have disregarded the facts which he himself records elsewhere, and which prove the death-rate of the year to have a very favourable significance with regard to every point of management and expenditure. He could not have failed to perceive that the epidemic of small-pox alone in 1878 added to the death-rate, when compared with that of 1877, a quantity which is more than double the general excess actually recorded; that the unprecedented mortality from fever which prevailed on all sides told with frightful effect on the classes resorting to the hospital, and that the high price of food increased the mortality from every form of sickness. He says further on of this very hospital that "anything like overcrowding must undoubtedly tend to increase a death-rate already excessive;" yet he makes no mention of the unexampled crowding of this sickly year when attempting to connect its death-rate with reduced expenditure. He ignores the fact that the increase of death-rate in the Campbell Hospital was a mere fraction of the increase which he himself records in every other Calcutta hospital where native paupers are received. In 1878 the increase in the mortality of the Campbell Hospital over that of 1877 was 5.38 per thousand of patients treated; in the Medical College Hospital it was 27.27; in the Mayo Hospital and its dependen- cies it was 18.34; at Howrah it was 80.08. In the two last institutions no change of practice occurred. The Howrah Hospital shares in the largest degree the disadvantages of Sealdah. It receives many moribund patients, but there is a counterpoise of many who are in good circumstances, while from Howrah small-pox patients are sent to Sealdah. Yet the death-rate was 8 per cent. over that of the previous year at Howrah, while at Sealdah one-half per cent. was the measure of the excess. At the Campbell Hospital in 1878 there died 253 per 1,000 of patients treated; in 1877, 248 per thousand; and in 1876, 250 per 1,000: but these two earlier years were years of good public health, and it is not fair to compare with them a year of exceptional ill-health, such as 1878. The year which could most fairly be compared with 1878 is the year 1875, which, though a year of better public health than 1878, was the most unhealthy year since the establishment of the hospital. In that year 7,782 patients were treated at a cost of Rs. 35,222 for diet and stimulants; in 1878, 11,001 were treated at a cost of only Rs. 23,876. In the year 1875, however, with a smaller number of patients and consequently less overcrowding, and an enormous expenditure per head of patients treated, the mortality was 280 per thousand; while in 1878, the year the diet economy is said to have had such mischievous effect, with great overcrowding and unprecedented general sickness, the death-rate was only 253 per thousand. Had the mortality of 1878 at the Campbell Hospital been double that of 1877, instead of barely exceeding it, it cannot be doubted that a valid defence could have been found for it in the events of the year; yet the Surgeon- General intimates that the highly favourable state of things recorded in the
( 5 ) returns might have been better under a policy which, as shown by his own figures, produced higher death-rates in years which were otherwise favourable beyond comparison. Dr. Irving himself states the fact that in 1875, when the average cost per diet was 3 annas 11 pies, the death-rate was 28 per cent.; in 1876, when the diet cost 3 annas 9 pies, the death-rate was 25 per cent.; while in 1878, when the diet cost only 2 annas 6 pies, the death-rate was still 25 per cent., notwithstanding all the unfavourable circumstances of a year of excep- tionally high prices and great sickness. The Lieutenant-Governor sees in the results of practice now recorded the strongest primâ facie reason to believe that the treatment of the sick during the past year at the Campbell Hospital can have left little to desire in their behalf. If Dr. Irving had considered this question in the joint interests of the State and the sick poor, as an administrative officer should have done, he must, the Lieutenant-Governor thinks, have seen evidence in the events of 1878 that the interests of both had been seriously neglected in former years; that the public had been made to pay enormously for medicines and for comforts which never reached the sick; and that the patients of the Campbell Hospital, while they have cost the State much less in 1878, have received more liberal and beneficial treatment than they ever received before. The view which the Lieutenant-Governor has endeavoured to enforce is that a dram of rum or a pound of rice actually consumed by the patients is far more efficacious than dozens of portwine or gallons of soup charged for by contractors, but never seen by the patients. It is no doubt the case that there are many hundreds of persons in the streets of Calcutta whose health might be improved, and indeed from whom disease might be averted, by "a liberal use of generous soups, milk, stimulants, and other kinds of food;" and the Lieutenant-Governor knows of no town in the world of which the same might not be said; but he is not aware that any Government in the world has recognized it as a part of its duty to raise taxes for the purpose of averting disease by a system of general liberal public diets. The mortality to which Dr. Irving alludes is to a great extent attributable, as he has elsewhere admitted, to the enormous number of moribunds sent to the pauper hospital in a state generally in which no diet in the world could help them. In the treatment of the sick the officers of the hospital have the fullest possible power to order any diet they consider actually necessary for the preservation of life. 8. The subscriptions to the various medical institutions amounted during the year to Rs. 25,134, against Rs. 35,075 in 1877 and Rs. 11,291 in 1876. While the subscriptions from Europeans fell from Rs. 31,609 to Rs. 11,134, those from natives rose from Rs. 3,465 to Rs. 14,000. Of the whole amount subscribed, Rs. 17,495 was received by the Mayo Hospital. The Mayo, the North Suburban Hospital, and the Alipore Dispensary, all invested surplus funds during the past year. 9. Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution and Lady Canning Home.( 6 ) the Surgeon-General in preparing his general statement of important operations performed in all the Calcutta medical institutions, it appears that the death- rates per cent. in the Medical College Hospital were 11.08 in 1876, 8.3 in 1877, and 4.7 in 1878, as compared with corresponding death-rates of 11.06, 8.4, and 7.09 in all the Calcutta hospitals in the same three years. These figures appear to the Lieutenant-Governor to show conclusively that the want of success in the treatment of surgical cases in former years was mainly due to causes other than the faulty construction of the building; the recent statistics when analysed entirely refute the conclusions that have been drawn from the returns of 1876 and previous years, and confirm the views recently adopted by Government as to the erroneous nature of the conclusions which had been drawn from the earlier surgical mortality, and as to the destructive character of the policy based upon them. The number of out-door patients who attended the dispensaries was higher even than in the previous year, there being 48,986 cases treated, against 47,506 in 1877. In the surgical dispensary 6,197 operations were performed as compared with 5,585, 3,617, 2,705, and 1,476 in the preceding four years. This steady rise, with a corresponding increase in the number of patients attending the surgical dis- pensary, is the best test of the increasing success and popularity of the institu- tion. There were 5,964 new patients at the ophthalmic dispensary against 5,464 in 1877; and the average daily attendance was 83.42. 11. General Hospital.( 7 ) present Superintendent.
