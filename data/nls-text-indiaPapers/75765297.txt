The prophylactic treatment was carried out on Laboratory horses under experimental conditions. These horses were given Trypanosomes subcutaneously at intervals by inoculation. The strain was obtained from a mule in Upper Burma and kept going in dogs. The makers state of Naganol that " a single dose of 1 gm. per 100 Kg. should afford a sufficient protec- tion lasting for two months," i.e., the dose is 44 gms. per 100 lbs. This statement could not be confirmed. Incidentally, it was found that 3 grm. per 100 lbs. killed a horse in 10 days. 1.5 gms. per 100 lbs. protected a horse for 4½ months but permanently damaged him. One gram per 100 lbs. caused acute toxic jaundice. Surra infection was resisted subsequently for (up to date) three months. In this particular case, treatment of the toxic effects of Naganol saved the animal, but it is evident that a drug which has such a small margin of safety should not be used with impunity. In the animals under experiment at the LaboratoryFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1932. 15 Osteoporosis.16 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, A study of feeding methods, administration of drugs and general care and maintenance of elephants was carried out. This work will be reported on separately by the officer concerned when completed and should constitute a very valuable contribution to the present (incomplete) knowledge of these animals in health and disease. CHAPTER VIFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1932. 17 uninoculated cattle which remain are the means of keeping infection smouldering and as the transient immunity conferred by Serum is lost in 1218 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, PROPHYLACTIC INOCULATION WORK. Preventive inoculations were performed during the year in connection with three diseases, viz., Rinderpest, Anthrax, and Hæmor- rhagic Septicæmia. A small batch of animals were also inoculated against Blackquarter. Inoculation work against Rinderpest has increased very considerably since the previous year and at present constitutes the main function of the Class II and subordinate staff. The cost of this method of dealing with the disease is at present very high and it is a matter for future consideration if the results justify the continued expenditure. Where all incontact cattle can be inoculated and efficiently segregated the results are extremely good but there is a growing tendency to rely on inoculation too much and to segregate only the visibly affected animals. Under these conditions the course of the disease is only slowed up and re-inoculations which become necessary at 14-day inter vals are not always agreed to if the disease appears to be on the wane. The increase in the inoculations against this disease during the year under review occurred mainly in the South-Western and Central Circles. The absence of effective supervision in the areas affected by the rebellion became apparent and energetic measures had to be taken to control the spread of the disease. Arrangements are now nearly complete for commencing research work on production of a vaccine for Rinderpest. This vaccine has been engaging the attention of Veterinary Research workers in various parts of the world in the last few years and recent results are extremely hopeful. The vaccine aims at establishing a permanent immunity at a single inoculation and although the method of conferring protection has disadvantages from a Veterinary point of view in that it maintains infection in the area, its successful introduction would be a great advance on both the Serum-only and Serum-Virus methods at present used in conferring immunity. Inoculation against Anthrax in elephants, cattle, and buffaloes was continued during the year under report. The inoculation of elephants with spore vaccine prepared at Insein gave very satisfactory results. Swellings at the site of inoculation were of much less frequent occur- rence than in the previous year and practically no local or general reactions were shown in animals which had been inoculated some 12 n onths previously. In non-inoculated animals the reactions were mild e cept in the older animals which appear in many cases to possess a d cided predisposition to the development of FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1932. 19 resulting immunity estimated it will be utilized for the initial inocula- tion of elephants. This it is expected will overcome the development of local swellings on primary inoculations in these animals. The im- munity conferred by spore vaccine in elephants is expected to last about 1220 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA. resulting from the inter-district movements of susceptible animals, has been seriously attempted. When such a policy is approved and can be applied it may be possible to demonstrate the value of the work of the Veterinary Service. (D) DEVELOPMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT DURING THE YEAR.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1932. 21 I have to express my thanks to the staff of the department for the work which they have successfully carried out during the year, at times, under considerable difficulties. As a result of reduction in numbers of the subordinate staff and increase in the size of the three remaining circle charges, the work expected from each officer will be increased in future until such time as new recruits can be trained, but I have no doubt that the staff will respond to the call for increased activities. In the Research Section the work during the year has been satis- factory and promising. In conclusion I would express on behalf of the department my sympathy with the relatives of U Tun Aung, Veterinary Superintendent, Katha, who with his wife was murdered by his servant while carrying- out his duties. U Tun Aung was a senior Veterinary Superintendent in the depart- ment and by his death the department has lost a valued officer who will at present be difficult to replace. D. T. MITCHELL, Director of Veterinary of Services. Burma.

In the 15 pages, to which Government has limited the Annual Report of the Department, it is only possible to touch on the results of the year's work and the present position of cattle disease in the Province very superficially ; but it is proposed in the future to publish the activi- ties of the Department, from time to time, in the form of a bulletin, as sufficient material becomes available. The assistance of the District officers has been very much appreciated during the year. Without their co-operation it would be practically impossible, in a large percentage of cases, to get the cultivator to take any action to help himself, and the work of the Department would be increased and considerably hampered. A sug- gestion to bring irregularities to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner frequently has a very salutary effect and speeds up the provision of segregation facilities, where otherwise there would be considerable apathy or even active opposition to preventive or control measures in contagious diseases. Until the cultivator possesses sufficient knowledge of the causes of spread of disease in animals and is willing to take the necessary action voluntarily, very close co-operation with, and the assistance of the District officers will be essential for the success of veterinary work in the Districts. In recognition of his work in the Department, the Government was pleased to award a certificate of honour and a gold watch to U Win, Veterinary Inspector, Moulmein. One officer died during the year, U Ba Shin, Veterinary Inspector, Meiktila. V Ba Shin was a promising young officer whose untimely death is very much regretted. In concluding this report I wish to thank all officers of the Depart- ment for their good work during the year and for the assistance which they have given in reducing the cost of the Department by improved organisation of their veterinary duties and economical touring in their charges.

The progressive drop in expenditure was due to reduction of dosage of serum in animals inoculated and the limitation of the use of serum to outbreaks where " stand still " and ' segregation " measures were not considered to be effective in exercising the necessary control of spread of infection. The reduced dosage of serum was found satisfactory in producing a transient period of passive immunity for approximately 10 days during which segregation measures and stoppage of movement of susceptible animals could be put into effect by the District officers under the Cattle Disease Rules. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1934. 7 to other points higher up on the main trade routes for cattle will be considered in the future. The important part, which cattle markets play in the dissemination of disease, has become apparent in the last few years as a result of investigations in the source of infection, particularly in Rinderpest, in connection with the cattle markets of Rangoon and Taungdwingyi. The voluntary closing of the latter cattle market by the President on the request of this Department through the Deputy Commissioner has had a marked effect on the suppression of disease in the Magwe and Thayetmyo Districts. This has been commented upon by the Deputy Commissioner, Magwe, in his remarks on the annual report of the Veterinary Inspector for that District.

The experiments were conducted by Mr. Mitchell assisted by Mr. Bhattacharjee, Research Officer at the Insein Laboratory. The work was still in progress at the end of the year and the results to date in the case of cattle, but not with buffaloes, were distinctly promising. FIELD RESEARCH. Mr. J. Smith, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Field Veterinary Research Officer continued to carry out the duties of this section throughout the year. He was provided with one Veterinary Assistant who accompanied him on district research work. A report on the work carried out during 1932-33 at the Elephant Sick Camp at Minbyin was completed and published for general information as a departmental bulletin.

It is satisfactory to note from the figures given in this report that in spite of :16 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1934. epizootic proportions that this action is taken. Usually it is then too late and the work of this Department is discredited in consequence. The active assistance of Township Officers and headmen in the early reporting of outbreaks, the provision of segregation areas, the proper disposal of carcases, in inducing villagers to give permission to inoculate, and of the Deputy Commissioners in closing infected areas to cattle movement, is under present conditions, of greater importance than any action which this Department can take to localise outbreaks. The veterinary staff can take legally only the action, under existing rules, which the headmen and villagers agree to and without the support of District and Township Officers their efforts to suppress disease will, in most cases, be of little avail. Assistance on these lines, which is accorded by many District officers, is acknowledged and very much appreciated, but it must be admitted that it might be given more frequently. To some extent the fault lies with the subordinate veterinary staff, who, probably on account of an inferiority complex, do not consult the District and Township Officers sufficiently early or often on these and other factors relating to disease control, which arise in their charges. In conclusion I have to thank all members of the Veterinary Staff for their efforts to suppress disease and alleviate the sufferings of animals during the year. Work on contagious disease is most onerous at the time of the year when touring is most difficult and uncomfortable and in the course of their inoculation duties, in remote unhealthy areas many of the staff have contracted disease which has affected their health for a considerable time afterwards. At the Veterinary Hospital, Insein, unrecognized rabies in dogs brought for treatment, is of frequent occurrence and in some cases a diagnosis is only possible after the animal has been carefully examined or kept under observation. Each year members of the Hospital staff of all grades have to undergo anti- rabic vaccination and this year the number included a Research Officer. Special mention may be made here of the work of the following departmental officers :APPENDICES. CHAPTER VII. PAGE TABLE 1.APPENDICES. 19 TABLE 1.20 APPENDICES.

The following diseases were treated at the hospital during the year under report :FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1935. 5 districts was approximately 88 per cent of the total. The total mortality in 1934-35 was 21,564 as against 16,517 for the previous year. The methods adopted to control the outbreaks were mainly those laid down in the " Cattle Disease Rules, 1914," but, as these were not always successful, it was found necessary in many instances to organize protective inoculation measures with the aid of anti-rinderpest serum. Foot-and-Mouth Disease.6 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, the previous year, were inoculated by the serum-alone method. Details of the inoculations carried out are shown herewithFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1935. 7 The Veterinary Assistant in charge inspected 18,158 cattle and buffaloes, including 1,376 inspected at Hlawga. Inspections were carried out on the arrival of the cattle and, if found apparently healthy, they were allowed to proceed to Rangoon. Foot-and-Mouth disease was detected in only two herds. In both cases the sick animals were segregated until the disease had subsided. Of the 18,158 cattle inspected, 17,754 were proceeding to the Rangoon Slaughter-house. Of the remainder 316 were plough cattle and 88 milch cattle. It was noticed that from January to May, both months inclusive, a smaller number of cattle passed through Htaukkyan than during the other months. This was due to the fact that after the paddy has been reaped many drovers proceed viâ Hlawga on the one side or Bauktaw and Thingangyun on the other. Arrangements are now being made for the erection of segregation sheds with enclosing fences in the compound, for the better supervision and segregation of animals when necessary. RULES. The final approval of the Local Government towards the introduc- tion of the revised Cattle Disease Rules, Burma Towns Rules, and the Glanders and Farcy Rules, is still awaited. CHAPTER IV.8 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Out of the nine students, six are stipendiaries and three non- stipendiaries. Arrangements are now being made to depute a second batch of eight students during the ensuing year. B.

The animals were stabled, never allowed in the sun, and two were given two ounces of codliver oil daily. All. five ponies developed osteoporosis in a pronounced clinical form. Two were destroyed and their bones had the typical macroscopic appearances associated with osteoporosis. These results indicate that the disease is not entirely due to dietetic deficiency as reported by other sceintific workers. The prevalence of the disease among racing and gharry ponies in Rangoon and the material available for experimental research as a result, will be taken advantage of in pushing experimental work on this disease as soon as accommodation and staff is available at Insein.

(b) Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1936. 11 4. General.12 REPORT ON THE VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, In the Upper Chindwin in particular the mortality in buffaloes was very heavy and control measures Were seriously hampered by the wildness of the animals, the absence of segregation facilities, and the unwillingness of the owners to bring up their animals for inoculation except in small batches. Local organization of mass inoculation measures were inadequate and staff of the Department available could not be utilized to the best advantage. In Tenasserim it was possible to inoculate a larger percentage of animals in the infected herds and results were very much better than in the Chindwin. In this area (Moulmein-Tavoy border) the first field tests on a large scale were initiated in connection with the new Desic- cated Goat Spleen Vaccine and the cattle owners, after a period of reluctance to inoculate, followed by a heavy mortality in their buffaloes, offered their animals for vaccination willingly. The disease persisted in the Katha and Myitkyina areas in spite of segregation measures. The new vaccine was not available sufficiently early in the year to apply in areas other than Tenasserim.

Arrangements will be made during next year to acquire an adjoining area of ten acres and, if this is sanctioned, work on Foot-and-Mouth will be proceeded with at once. The control of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia has been giving considerable difficulty. The losses from this disease appear to be increasing and it has always been difficult to get the owners to accept preventive inoculation before the onset of the disease. Until more knowledge on the methods of prevention can be distributed to the buffalo owners in the infected areas and more staff is available for propaganda and inoculation work, progress in connection with the control of this disease will be slow. The appointment of a Specialist Officer on contract, and the gift of experimental stables at Insein by the Rangoon Turf Club, will enable the Department to organize and develop its research work on obscure diseases of horses and ponies in this province during 1936-37. The increase of inoculation work, particularly in the last few months of the year, has made the existing staff shortage very apparent. This will probably be felt even more during 1936-37 when an organized campaign of Rinderpest Vaccination is contemplated. The pressure will be somewhat relaxed in March 1937, when the first batch of students will graduate from Madras, and in the meantime two batches of students will have passed out from the Insein College. The Department will, however, feel the effect of shortage of competent inoculators of the Veterinary Inspector's class for the next three years and it will not be possible to make full use of all the prophy- lactic agents, which the Research Laboratory will be in a position to supply, until after 1938, when the sanctioned staff should be more or less complete. During January of this year, Mr. F. Ware, F.R.C.V.S., Director of the Imperial Veterinary Research Laboratory at Muktesar, visited Burma and was shown over the various institutions of veterinary interest and did a short tour in the Province. Mr. D. T. Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Burma, took advantage of his leave in South Africa to visit Rhodesia and spent some time in the Veterinary Research Laboratory at Salisbury studying Foot-and-Mouth disease particularly in regard to methods of control and vaccination. A report giving a detailed account of the method of preparation and application of the Rhodesian Vaccine for Foot-and-Mouth disease was prepared on his return and submitted to Government. It is with very great regret that the death of one gazetted officer of. the Department has to be recorded during the year. U Ko Ko Gyi, Veterinary Superintendent, was a promising young officer who had done good work both in the research laboratory and in the field.

Quarantine restrictions in outbreak areas were imposed under existing rules where possible, but during this year reliance was mostly placed on vaccination measures. The results in practice indicated that this vaccine gave good protection from the third day onwards and was used, not only in outbreak areas but in the adjoining clean areas, to form a belt of immune cattle surrounding outbreaks, with very great success.

Three hundred and seventy-two (372) smears were from cattle and buffaloes, 281 from elephants, 108 from horses and 71 from other animals. Of the positive smears 30 were Surra (22 horses, 4 elephants and 4 cattle), 15 Anthrax (4 horses, 3 elephants and 8 cattle), 16 Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia (1 elephant and 15 cattle), one Anaplamosis in cattle, one Blackquarter in cattle, one Epizootic Lymphangitis in a horse, and one Secondary Anæmia in a dog. (b) Fæces.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1937. 11 During the year three elephants only are recorded to have died of Anthrax. Two of these had not been inoculated and one died a few days after inoculation. This result affords excellent proof of the value of the vaccine. Previously the Timber Lessees lost about a hundred elephants annually from Anthrax. During the year under report no immunised elephant died of Anthrax, even though use Was made of grazing grounds known to be so grossly infected with Anthrax that in former years it was imperative to keep them free from elephants. The third death is interesting as illustrating the individual susceptibility of elephants to Anthrax. Out of 3,128 elephants inoculated in 1936-37 this was the only death, and though inoculated in previous years this animal had shown no reaction to the Vaccine. From the history of the case it is presumed that death was caused by the reaction to the inoculation. 2. Laboratory Research Work12 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, tours by the Veterinary Research Officer to various elephant camps, maintained by timber firms in jungle areas. In a report submitted to the Field Veterinary Research Advisory Committee the results of the investigation work were recorded, tentative suggestions given, and recommendations made for future research work on this very important subject. It was indicated that investigation of diseases of elephants would require the whole time of a Veterinary Officer, but at present it is not possible to depute a man for this work. It is unfortunate that pressure of work at Insein and elsewhere has made it impossible for the Research Officer to continue systematically the investigation of elephant diseases. An aged elephant, obtained from the Forest Department in January, was destroyed at the Laboratory. The skeleton is being prepared for the anatomical museum and the histological structure of the various tissues and organs is being studied microscopically by the temporary Veterinary Research Officer.

PROPHYLACTIC INOCULATION WORK. The main work under this heading during the year was in connec- tion with Rinderpest, the animals inoculated against the disease being increased from 94,012 in 1935-36 to 367,246 in 1936-37. All these animals with the exception of 2,447, were inoculated with Goat Spleen Vaccine, which gives immunity against the disease for over two years Vaccinations were carried cut in outbreak areas but the greater number of the animals were in clean areas, the work being carried out during the non-working period of the cold weather season in cattle near the main roads, on cattle routes, and in the cattle breeding areas This extensive vaccination should in a very short time have a marked effect in decreasing the annual mortality from the disease. Vaccination against this disease in buffaloes was introduced generally during the year with marked success. The dose given to these animals is very much smaller than that given to cattle and when it was found that this reduced dose could be used with safety in the immunisation of these animals sanction of Government was obtained to its general use in the Province. The use of Anthrax Spore Vaccine and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia Vaccine for susceptible animals was continued during the year with satisfactory results.

Until protective inoculations have become more popular and have been made compulsory as a routine procedure in the case of Bazaar sellers' animals, trade cattle, and animals used for cart traffic between Townships and Districts, the hope of eradicating contagious diseases completely in any area of the Province is remote. The concentration of susceptible and infected cart animals at Pagoda Festivals, Markets, and Bazaars, their distribution later along main roads and to the adjoining Districts, gives contagious diseases ideal conditions for spread. On one occasion it was reported that a Festival in the Lower Chindwin District, at which nearly a thousand carts were counted, was responsible for the wide dissemination of Rinderpest in three districts. The results of vaccination against Rinderpest during the year has had a very good effect in popularising preventive inoculations in general as it has on many occasions been demonstrated to the cattle owners in a practical manner that vaccinated animals have resisted infection successfully in a subsequent outbreak involving the unvaccinated animals of the same village. These observations have in the latter part of the year induced cattle owners to offer a larger percentage of their animals for vaccination. Until however 100 per cent of the cattle in each village can be protected by vaccination simultaneously, there will remain a sufficient number of susceptible animals to allow infection to smoulder in the herds and prevent its final eradication. Work on the production of Foot-and-Mouth Vaccine had to be further postponed pending increased acreage and facilities for the preliminary experimental work at the Insein Laboratory. Plans for the acquisition of the necessary land were maturing at the end of the year and it is considered that work on this disease will be possible in 1937-38. With the increase in vaccine production, the staff and accommo- dation for Research at the Insein Laboratory is now being found insufficient to meet requirements and Research work on new problems has had to be slowed up or in some cases suspended. It will be necessary in the near future to provide separate isolated sections for the manufacture of each of the vaccines, which are now being produced in a laboratory room common to all. Proposals in this connection are at present being prepared for submission to Government. Owing to shortage of field staff for carrying out the intensive inoculation campaign against Rinderpest, a number of temporary record clerks up to a maximum of 12 was sanctioned by Government to assist inoculation parties, thus releasing one Veterinary Assistant

Their employment effected a considerable saving in the cost of inoculation work and they were found very useful in augmenting the staff available for vaccination. The co-operation between District officers and the Field staff of the Department was on many occasions favourably commented upon by Departmental officers during the year. This is fully endorsed by practical experience and observations. The work of the staff throughout the year has been consistently good. From the many officers who carried out their duties with efficiency and enthusiasm special mention may be made of the following :APPENDICES CHAPTER VII.

INDEX. PAGE CHAPTER I.REPORT OF THE Civil Veterinary Department, Burma For the year ending the 31st March 1938. CHAPTER I.2 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, The staff in the Arakan Circle consisted of one Veterinary Superintendent, two Veterinary Inspectors and thirteen Veterinary Assistants. VETERINARY RESEARCH LABORATORY, INSEIN, AND VETERINARY COLLEGE. Mr. Bhattacharjee, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., F.C.S., officiated as Research Officer and Principal during the absence of Mr. G. Pfaff. B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., on leave, from the beginning of the year to 6th November 1937, when he reverted to the post of officiating Veterinary Research Officer. Mr. Pfaff resumed control of these duties on his return on the above date and remained in charge until the end of the year. Mr. M. H. V. Brown, B.V.Sc., Temporary Research Officer, carried out duties in the Research Laboratory and Veterinary College Sections during the year. The staff at the Veterinary Research Laboratory and Veterinary College consisted of one Veterinary Inspector, five Veterinary Assistants ; and one Assistant Principal, one Veterinary Inspector, one Veterinary Assistant, respectively. NEW APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS. Six students who graduated from the Veterinary College, Madras, and three from the Veterinary College, Calcutta, on completion of post-graduate training at the Insein Veterinary College, were posted to District charges. These were the first graduates trained in Indian Colleges to be appointed under the Departmental reorganization, given effect to in 1934. Thirteen Veterinary Students, who completed the Veterinary Assistant's Course at Insein, were posted to Township charges during the year.

These districts were Toungoo (2,505), Yamèthin (1,793), Myingyan (1,458), Pakôkku (1,252), Meiktila (960), Pegu (820). The mortality in these six districts alone was 8,788. Outbreaks during the year totalled 1,364 as against 984 during 1936-37. In spite of this increased incidence the total mortality from this disease in all districts in the Province was 11,161 which is a decrease on the mortality in 1936-37 by 19,910 or 64 per cent. This decrease in mortality is directly due to the work of the Veterinary staff in carrying out a continuous inoculation campaign against the disease in clean and infected areas by goat spleen vaccine, which produces a rapid and lasting immunity and has given excellent results in cattle throughout the year. The inoculation of buffaloes has not been so satisfactory as these animals develop a more severe reaction on vaccination due to their higher susceptibility and this has interfered with vaccination work and disease control in some areas where buffaloes are numerous. Although severe reactions in buffaloes have not been general, but localized to certain areas, news of these unfavourable reactions from inoculations spread fast and far amongst the villagers and was used in order to provide a reason for refusing or evading vaccination. Foot-and-Mouth Disease.6 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, were localized and resulted only in a small mortality in each case but occurred over most of the districts of the Province. Annual inoculations with spore vaccine have been successful in preventing heavy mortality from the disease in epizootic areas. The total mortality during 1937-38 was 825 in 30 districts as against a mortality of 690 in 29 districts during the previous year. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 7 Frontier trade, in which the disease is very frequent but impossible to deal with owing to the nature of the frontier and the type of Chinese muleteers in charge of caravans. The cases which occurred in Maymyo were all recently purchased gharry ponies which had been illicitly introduced without having been submitted to the usual quarantine and Mallein tests. PREVENTIVE INOCULATIONS. 2, Rinderpest.8 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, mythuns and one buffalo, were inoculated. The remainder of the serum having been out of cold storage for several months had to be destroyed. The cost of anti-rinderpest serum imported from India during the year was Rs. 19,916-4-0. Goat spleen vaccine prepared at the Insein Veterinary Research Laboratory was used during the year in clean and infected areas for the prevention and control of Rinderpest, with very good results. Mortality in cattle was rare and in buffaloes was small except in localized areas of high susceptibility of the animals. A total of 549,564 animals were immunized during the year against the previous year's total of 364,799. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 9 QUARANTINE STATIONS ON INTER-DISTRICT TRADE ROUTES. 3. The Veterinary Inspection post at Htaukkyan, 22 miles from Rangoon, was continued during 1937-38 and 15,505 animals were inspected while in transit to Rangoon. This post has now given the information required regarding the control and supervision of trade animals and it is proposed to close the post at the end of the year. It has been shown that, unless such posts are sited in a position which geographically or by other means (railways) compels traders to keep to the main road with their herds, they will take every opportunity of avoiding inspection of their animals, even though this means many more miles of travel. The usefulness of inspection posts has been demonstrated in preventing the spread of disease but it would be necessary to make provision for the inoculation of all animals by Rinderpest vaccine, in addition to the inspection of animals and detention of suspects, if the scheme is to be successfully operated on the main trade routes throughout the Province. Immunization against Rinderpest of all animals which pass through infected areas should be the primary object of the Inspection Posts and the rapid production of immunity within a few days, coupled with the slight reaction which the vaccination gives rise to, justifies this immunization being carried out. To give effect to this it will be necessary to amend the Inoculation rules and until this has been done it is useless to attempt control of contagious disease on the main trade routes in Burma by Veterinary Inspection and Quarantine only. This question will be investigated during 1938-39. FRONTIER POSTS. 4. Inspection of animals for contagious diseases on importation by land routes from adjoining countries was carried out during the open season of the year (October to May). Animals as per the following statement were inspected at the posts of entry indicated :10 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, The remarks in the report for 1936-37 in regard to these figures still apply. The recorded figures give only a small percentage of actual imports. Much of the disease, especially Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth, which occurred during the year in the area adjoining the Mandalay- Rangoon main road and the Thazi-Myingyan main road is reported to have been introduced by trade cattle from the Shan States and Karenni. While this is possible, it cannot be stated definitely in the absence of efficient inspection of imported animals in the border area. This is impossible under present conditions of staff shortage. It is considered that until a more effective check, coupled with compulsory immunization, cm be introduced in connection with these animals on import, the annual cost of Rinderpest control in Burma will remain high. QUARANTINE STATION AT RANGOON. 5. A site for this station was selected at Ahlcne adjoining and to the North of the Government Timber Depôt. The area is approximately three acres in extent and was transferred to this Department from the Rangoon Devel opment Trust. A scheme for the development of this site as a Quarantine station for dealing with the import and export of domestic animals under the provisions of the rules to be issued under the Livestock Importation Act, was sanctioned. RULES. 6. The revised Livestock Importation Rules are still under considera- tion and pending their issue it has not been possible to exercise effective control of trans-Frontier trade, as the existing rules only deal with imports by sea routes. Rules for the control of contagious diseases of animals in town areas were issued during the year by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests. CHAPTER IV.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 11 The Evans Memorial Prize Gold Medal, awarded to the student obtaining highest marks at the qualifying examination at the end of the course, was won by Maung Tun Han. A fifth batch of students were recruited in November 1937 and consisted of four stipendiary, three non-stipendiary students, two students from the Shan States and four private.

Instruction on housing and feeding of animals and diseases was given to cattle owners by the field staff during tours. Shows and Pagoda festivals were attended by these officers where possible and lectures and demonstrations given. This work is mainly directed against contagious diseases, but general information on Stock Improve- ment is also given. BULLETINS AND LEAFLETS AND VETERINARY PROPAGANDA. 4. The position in regard to Veterinary propaganda still remains unchanged. At present the available staff would be unable to cope with the additional work which this would entail and the work which is very urgent and essential has had to be postponed.

Lawkeen Swoadi, Veterinary Officer, Department of Agri- culture and Fisheries, Bangkok, Siam, and two Siamese studentsFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 17 These animals are partly maintained by artificial feeding and the conditions are not ideal for the production of healthy well developed stud animals for future stock improvement schemes. The extension of this farm at Tatkôn by the acquisition of an adjoining 110 acres of land is under consideration. A comprehensive scheme was submitted to Government for developing cattle breeding and supplying bulls of the Burmese breed in the future for distribution to cultivators for improvement of village herds. After a survey of the greater part of the cattle breeding area of Central Burma, a site was selected for a cattle farm in the Yamèthin District on the foothills of the Pegu Yomas, where good soil, a good water supply, and opportunities for extension at a reasonable cost exist. This scheme is at present under consideration. The staff employed at the Tatkôn Cattle Breeding farm consisted of one Burman stockman and six labourers. Assistance in regard to clerical work and maintenance of breeding records was given by the Officer-in-charge of the Government Agricul- tural Farm adjoining who also supplies green fodder from 20 acres of the Agricultural Farm reserved for this purpose. The total cost of this Government cattle breeding farm during 1937-38 was Rs. 2,318. CHAPTER VII.18 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, animals have been protected by goat spleen vaccination in the last two years. In many instances only those animals, which for reasons of work or otherwise, escaped the inoculation when carried out as a prophylactic in the absence of the disease, succumbed to natural infection in an outbreak occurring subsequently. Lower Burma continued to be relatively free from this disease. In Upper Burma the heaviest mortality occurred in Yamèthin and Toungoo Districts on the Mandalay trunk road and in Myingyan and Meiktila on the Thazi-Myingyan main road. Anthrax.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 19 General Remarks on Disease Control.20 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, The free movement of non-immunized cattle, either in herds going to markets from trans-frontier areas (Imported trade cattle) or from adjoining districts, the general use of bullocks in carts for inter-township or district trade (carting of produce or attendance at bazaars by bazaar sellers) and the movements of large masses of Indian owned milk cattle from monsoon to dry weather pastures and vice versa, give unlimited opportunities for the spread of Rinderpest and its persistence in areas of Central Burma. This results in the dry zone being not only an area for the breeding of cattle but also a reservoir for those contagious diseases which are readily transmissible by contact (Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth disease). Owing to the very high susceptibility of the buffalo to Rinderpest and the more severe reaction developed on vaccination, these animals introduce a very serious problem in eradication or control of Rinderpest. The average cattle mortality in outbreaks of Rinderpest amongst non- inoculated herds rarely exceeds 20 per cent and the deaths from vaccina- tion are under ¼ per cent. In buffaloes the average mortality is 85 per cent in natural outbreaks and average 4 per cent on vaccination. The difficulties of obtaining 100 per cent vaccinations in a herd noted previously in connection with cattle are accentuated in the case of buffaloes and it is this animal which has in certain areas during the last 18 months created an unfavourable impression in the minds of villagers against Rinderpest vaccination and interfered very considerably with the campaign of preventive inoculation in clean areas. Further Research work on this problem of immunization of buffaloes against Rinderpest is essential but it has not been yet possible owing to lack of a sufficient area of land at the Veterinary Research Laboratory, Insein. Experiments with these animals under stable conditions had to be discarded as deaths in controls resulted from the unnatural conditions of confinement. The acquisition of an additional area of land adjoin- ing the Laboratory at Insein for work on buffaloes has been delayed for many months owing to difficulties in connection with land acquisi- tion. When this land is eventually placed at the disposal of the Research Laboratory, the work will be initiated. The problem of movements of susceptible cattle and buffaloes in relation to the prevention and control of contagious diseases, particularly Rinderpest, is one which is difficult, if not impossible to solve under present conditions. Until the benefits of immunization and the danger of cattle movements in infected areas are more widely understood by the cattle owners and until these cattle owners voluntarily co-operate with the Department, no control measures can be expected to meet with complete success. This co-operation is more readily given under existing conditions by Burman than by Indian cattle owners, and to deal with this latter
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 21 group of owners it may be necessary in the near future to introduce legislation with a view to reduce the numbers of surplus or useless cattle which are now maintained in many areas around the larger towns and along railways. Proposals in this connection will be submitted to Government during next year. On the facts recorded above it will be apparent that more vigorous action will be required in the future if control and eradication of preventable contagious diseases in Upper Burma is to be made efficient and this action will involve new legislation and amendment of rules under existing Acts. These proposals may be briefly summarized as follows :22 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, and South Africa where "stand still" orders, strict isolation, and slaughter of all animals in outbreaks, are the chief weapons used in prevention and can be effectively imposed, the disease when introduced gives rise to widespread outbreaks. It is now some years since details were available to this Department on the control measures adopted in Rhodesia with considerable success. This method involves the preparation of a vaccine which produces a mild attack of the disease and a short period (about six months) immunity on being sprayed into the nostril of the animal. Lack of isolation facilities at the Veterinary Research Laboratory, Insein, for working with this disease simultaneously with the production of Rinderpest, Anthrax, and other vaccines and the risk of having these products contaminated with Foot-and-Mouth virus has prevented progress on this vaccine up to date. It was also recognized that the staff available for inoculation was insufficient for undertaking Foot-and- Mouth prophylactic inoculation in addition to the other diseases for which vaccines are provided. When these difficulties are removed by the allocation of more funds for staff and Laboratory buildings by Government, this work will be proceeded with, but until then it is felt that Research work on Foot-and-Mouth cannot be safely undertaken. The Department has now at its disposal the means of giving an efficient protection by vaccination against the following diseases :FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1938. 23 against contagious diseases. To carry this out, additional staff is urgently required for propaganda, inoculation, and township and border patrol work.

Mitchell, M.R.C.V.S., B.V.S. (Class I), held charge of the Department from the beginning of the year until 5th March, 1939, on which date he relinquished charge. He proceeded on leave on 3rd March. From 6th March until the end of the year Captain S. R. Rippon, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., officiated as Director of Veterinary Services. U Nyan Kyaw, G.B.V.C., B.V.S. (Class II), held charge of the duties of the post of Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Lower Burma Charge, from 1st April, 1938, to 10th October, 1938, on which date Captain S. R. Rippon, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., resumed charge on return from study leave in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. Captain Rippon then remained in charge of the Lower Burma Charge as Deputy Director until 6th March, 1939, when he took over the Department from Mr. Mitchell. U Nyan Kyaw was appointed to officiate as Deputy Director of Veterinary Services and he was in charge of Lower Burma from 6th March until the end of the year. The staff in the Lower Burma Charge consisted of one Deputy Director, three Veterinary Superintendents, fourteen Veterinary Inspectors and sixty-six Veterinary Assistants. U Pe Than, A.T.M., G.B.V.C., B.V.S. (Class I), remained in control of the Upper Burma Charge as Deputy Director throughout the year. His staff consisted of three Veterinary Superintendents, seventeen Veterinary Inspectors and seventy-four Veterinary Assistants. The general organization of the field staff remained unchanged. Mr. G. Pfaff, B.Sc. (Edin.), M.R.C.V.S., B.V.S. (Class I), remained in charge of the Veterinary Research Laboratory and Veterinary College, Insein, throughout the year, as Research Officer and Principal. Mr. J. Bhattacharjee, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., F.C.S., B.V.S. (Class I), held the post of Officiating Veterinary Research Officer until 2nd September, 1938, when he proceeded on leave overseas.
2 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Mr. M. H. V. Brown, B.V.Sc., Temporary Research Officer, was on duty in the Veterinary Research Laboratory until 18th July, 1938, when he proceeded on leave overseas. He resumed charge of his duties on 18th January, 1939, on return from leave. The period of his contract was extended for two years from 15th March, 1939. The staff at the Veterinary Research Laboratory and Veterinary College consisted of one Veterinary Inspector, five Veterinary Assistants ; and one Assistant Principal, one Veterinary Inspector and two Veterinary Assistants respectively. New Appointments and Promotions. Six students, graduates of Madras and Calcutta Veterinary Colleges, were given appointments in the Department as Veterinary Inspectors on probation, and were posted to districts. Nine Veterinary students, graduates of the Insein Veterinary College, passed out during the year and were given appointments as Veterinary Assistants (New Grade). VACANT POSTS IN THE DEPARTMENT.

Until the new Livestock Importation Rules are notified it is not possible to know to what extent this quarantine station, as it stands, will meet requirements. It is very unlikely that it will be sufficient. Indeed the modifications were agreed to only in order to get the station, which is a Major Work, started.

CHAPTER VI14 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, sanctioned for the acquisition of only 463 69 acres, at a cost of Rs. 13,932, together with fencing, water supply and construction of quarters for the staff at a cost of Rs. 28,210. At the end of the year acquisition proceedings were still in progress, but it will be at least another year before the transfer of the farm from Tatkôn can be effected. Extension of the area at Inbaung will undoubtedly be necessary in the future, if a herd of reasonable dimensions is to be maintained. 3. The heifers and cows bred on the farm are good in conformation and type, but the bulls are disappointing, and drastic culling will be necessary. It will be a considerable time before village distribution can take place. 4. Foot-and-mouth disease broke out in February and ran through the herd, as it was impossible to segregate. The policy adopted was to let the disease run through the herd as quickly as possible. The outbreak caused further loss of condition, but subsided without any casualties. 5. At the end of the year the numbers of animals were :FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 3lST MARCH 1939. 15 The rinderpest vaccination campaign has been carried on to as great an extent as possible, and has no doubt materially assisted in reducing mortality. It is, however, premature to attribute to vaccination the absence of widespread outbreaks during the last three yaars. The peak years of greatest mortality during the periods of irregular cyclical recrudescence have been 1906, 1910, 1919, 1925 and 1936, and the mortality in 1936 was more per 1,000 of the bovine population than it was in 1910, while in 1917 the mortality was lower than it has been during the present year, though no doubt in the earlier years reporting of deaths was not so efficient. It should be borne in mind that importation from Siam has decreased of late years, and this may have a bearing on the freedom from Rinderpest of the Salween, Thatôn and Amherst Districts. Much larger numbers of cattle enter from the Shan States into Yamèthin (Upper Burma) and Toungoo (Lower Burma) and in those districts, in spite of vaccination, the Rinderpest mortality has continued the heaviest. Last year in Yamèthin 54,211 were vaccinated compared with only 23,288 in Toungoo. This year 39,993 were done in Yamethin and only 19,864 in Toungoo. In Lower Burma districts vaccination can be carried out for only about six months of the year, due to climatic reasons and the ploughing and carting seasons. Moreover in many parts of Lower Burma the cattle in a village are not easily collected for vaccination, as they are frequently kept scattered in small herds here and there. In Upper Burma vaccination can be carried out over a much greater period of the year, and the village cattle are more often than not kept all together in an enclosure at night, and so are more easily dealt with. In both Upper and Lower Burma many of the cows are rather refractory and difficult to deal with. Although the best cattle are bred in the recog- nized breeding districts of Upper Burma a considerable amount of breeding goes on in Lower Burma, so that Lower Burma has many cows in addition to the more amenable trained bullocks purchased from Upper Burma. Notwithstanding these difficulties the staff in Lower Burma last year vaccinated 197,648, compared with 351,916 done in Upper Burma, and this year 137,128 have been vaccinated in Lower Burma compared with 261,500 in Upper Burma. These two years' work alone represent the vaccinatian of 18 per cent of the cattle population in Upper Burma and of 14 per cent in Lower Burma. As more of the Veterinary Assistants receive a training in Rinderpest vaccination technique it should be possible for them afterwards to inoculate larger numbers of animals in their township charges. They will be able, if necessary, to work on their own and in this way it is hoped shortly to increase the total number of immunized cattle. It is largely a matter of organization and intelligent drawing up of programmes. The system has already been introduced into Lower
16 REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, Burma where, as has been indicated, it is necessary to work against time, and the results have been quite promising. Comparatively few buffaloes have been vaccinated, on account of their very low resistance to the virus of Rinderpest. In one case in the field a buffalo escaped after receiving only an infinitesimal quantity of vaccine from the prick of a needle, and before the barrel of the syringe had been attached. This animal reacted just as severely as others which received the full dose. It is the subsequent mortality in buffaloes, however, and the great loss of condition in those which recover from the reaction, which still prevents wholesale vaccination of these animals being undertaken. Experimental work is now being carried on at Insein in connection with this problem. In last year's report a reference was made to certain proposals regarding compulsory inoculation, which it was intended to submit to Government this year. The co-operation of the Siamese authorities was sought in order to try and effect a better measure of Rinderpest control on the Amherst District Border, by vaccination of Siamese sale cattle at the Frontier and of all cart-bullocks engaged in to-and-fro trade. It was arranged that a preliminary survey should be carried rut by the Siamese authorities, and this is being done. The other proposals, involving amendment of the " Contagious Diseases of Animals (Villages) Rules, 1936 " to make provision for compulsory inoculation, were not submitted, and it is now considered that they were too far-reaching for present-day conditions. The draft of the Revised Livestock Importation Rules was reconsidered with a view to making the Rules more practicable. Proposals were submitted for the introduction of new legislation for the improvement of agricultural stock and the prevention of overstocking of grazing areas and village lands, but it was agreed that the matter should be kept pending a decision of the Fiscal Committee on the question of a Cattle Tax. Similar proposals have been discussed several times since 1909, and especially since the Stock Breeding Committee, 1917, but have hitherto not been considered to be feasible. There is nothing to add to last year's remarks concerning the position with regard to foot-and-mouth disease. The Department continues to waste time and money in attempting to deal with the outbreaks by segregation, in accordance with the existing Rules. Proposals for altering the Rules to bring them more into line with, those in force in some other tropical countries have not yet been made and this matter will now receive early attention. It will be necessary to adopt measures best suited to this country. In Rhodesia, for instance, vaccination is combined with stoppage of movement over a wide area, requiring cordons of special police, and the enclosing with fencing of belts of country sometimes as much as 250 miles in circumference, as well as slaughter of calves born during the period of infection after
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1939. 17 inoculation. Such would be quite impracticable here. The vaccine used there protects for about six months, giving an immunity of no longer duration than that which results from a natural attack of the disease in Burma. Nevertheless it is intended to pursue the approved policy of manufacturing a vaccine so soon as facilities are available. So far as Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Blackquarter are concerned, it has been possible for many years to obtain vaccines to protect against these, but outbreaks are usually of such a sporadic nature and the diagnosis is so often in doubt, that widespread inoculation would hardly have justified the expenditure involved, even if the staff had been sufficiently large to allow of such activities in addition to the more important work of rinderpest control. Glanders eradication received further attention, the Mandalay Municipality being invited to express its views on some draft Rules intended to facilitate the application of the " Glanders and Farcy Rules, 1936. " It is hoped that it will be possible to take some definite action, in the way of introducing periodic mallein testing of gharry ponies, during the coming year, first in Mandalay and later on in other Municipalities. It is a matter for congratulation that the sanctioned cadre of Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants has been increased during the year, thus continuing the steady policy of enlargement which has been a feature of the Department since its inception over 50 years ago, except for the lean years of retrenchment. It may be expected that a still larger cadre will be required at some later date, if the research work being done is to bear fruit in the shape of practical result in the field and not to remain of academic interest only. At the same time due attention will be paid to possible economies, in so far as these do not interfere with the performing of essential work. Thanks are due to the District Officers for their assistance to the staff of the Department, particulary in helping to get the consent of cattle owners to prophylactic inoculation, and in endeavouring to popularize it The departmental staff has worked well, with very few exceptions. Particularly good work has been done by Mr. G. Pfaff, Veterinary Research Officer, to whom the Department is indebted for the very successful Rinderpest vaccine now in almost daily use. He has worked at high pressure during the absence of his other Class I officers on leave, and deserves the highest praise. He was very ably assisted by U Tun Aung, Assistant Principal. The cost of the Department during 1938-39 was Rs. 5,65,040. S. R. RIPPON, Offg. Director of Veterinary Services, Burma. Dated 25th July 1939.

At the end of the year the number of animals at the farm was :FOR THE YEAR ENDING 3lST MARCH 1940. 15 The following table shows the numbers of cattle vaccinated in the different Districts during the four-year period ending with the year under review : 16 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, small percentage of the total cattle population, yet should tend to afford a good measure of economic protection to the country. The campaign will be steadily continued, re-vaccinating cattle at the end of the four-year period and at the same time vaccinating any newly-intro- duced animals. The response of the cattle-owner has been very good on the whole, though unfortunately some owners still prefer to wait until the natural disease breaks out. Such apathy, more than the negligible mortality and generally mild reactions due to the vaccination, results in fewer numbers being done than would otherwise be the case. The arrangements made last year with the Thailand authorities for the better control of rinderpest on the Amherst District border were proceeded with and some progress made. The Director of Veterinary Services, Burma, met the Veterinary Expert, Bangkok, on the border and decided which of the suggested measures would be practicable. Nearly all the cart-bullocks engaged in to-and-fro movement across the border at Myawaddy have been immunised, but the vaccination and control of movement of sale cattle is likely to offer greater difficulty. The question of opening proper quarantine stations on the Burma side of the border has not yet been settled. It is bound up with the revised Livestock Importation Rules, which are still under the consideration of Government. In the meantime the belt of immune cattle previously established in the Kawkareik Township has been maintained against the danger of introduction of rinderpest from Thailand, and it is therefore considered that a quarantine station is not a prime necessity. Foot-and-mouth disease during the year under report was wide- spread in spite of segregation measures being enforced wherever possible. The mortality was unusually heavy, but this is attributed to the fact that in the Delta, where most of the deaths occurred, the outbreaks coincided with severe floods and consequent shortage of suitable fodder, resulting in the deaths of animals which under normal circumstances would have recovered. As in other tropical countries, segregation of incontact animals has almost invariably had little effect on stopping the spread of this disease in a village-tract, and proposals have now been submitted to Government which, if accepted, will render such segregation non-obligatory, while at the same time the stoppage of movement into or out of the affected area will tend to prevent spread beyond it. This will result in the disease running its course more quickly in the affected village-tract and animals will have recovered and be ready for work instead of being incapacitated at a time when they are required. There is nothing new in the idea, and it was in fact the procedure allowed for in the old " Cattle Disease Rules, 1914". Glanders was not reported from any district throughout the year. As mentioned in last year's report, it had been hoped that it would be
FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1940. 17 possible to test the gharry ponies in the Mandalay Municipality. Unfortunately before the Municipal authorities could come to any decision on the measure of assistance which they could afford to this Department for the purpose of carrying out the test, the Municipal Committee was superseded and the question had to be re-opened by the Committee which succeeded it, with the result that no action could be taken during the year. It is feared that the funda- mental objection to the slaughter of reactors to the Mallein test may prove an obstacle very difficult to surmount when the question of giving the necessary assistance for the carrying out of the test is the point at issue. Without such assistance, however, it would be no easy task for officers of this Department to undertake the work. The gharry owners may not co-operate, especially as no compensation is given for animals destroyed. 3. It is again a pleasant duty to acknowledge the help given to the Department by District Officers, whose assistance and ready co-opera- tion has played an appreciable part in the measures the Department has been able to take for the prevention and control of contagious disease. The work of the field staff has been very satisfactory on the whole, and the staff at the Veterinary College and Research Laboratory has continued to do very useful work under the enthusiastic and efficient supervision of the Research Officer and Principal, Mr. Pfaff. 4. The cost of the Department during 1939-40 was Rs. 6,00,425 compared with Rs. 5,65,040 for 1938-39. S. R. RIPPON, Director of Veterinary Services, Burma.

Altogether 73,467 cattle and buffaloes received the double inoculation, which is an increase of 9,690 over last year. The apparent decrease this year in the single hæmorrhagic septicæmia and single anthrax inoculations, referred to previously, is partly offset by this increase in the double inoculation.

Most of his cases were clinically far more acute and severer than those seen in Burma, and cerebral involvement was the rale rather than the exception in them : this has never been seen in Burma. It is probable that the Indian cases are a different condition ; certainly they were more acute and severer than the characteristic partial paraplegia which is known as Kumri in Burma. Perhaps the virus had already disappeared from the body in the Burma cases by the time the disease was diagnosed and the animal destroyed to obtain material for sub-inoculation. No bacteria have been demonstrated in Kumri cases. A fodder or poisonous plant intoxication cannot be excluded although the histological lesions are more suggestive of a virus infection.

The buildings and fencing at the new site at Inbaung were completed during the year by the Public Works Department and were taken over by the Department on the 13th December 1940, but work in connection with the water supply was still in progress at the end of the year. The delay over the latter project is due to the non-receipt of the pipes from the overhead tanks to the watering troughs, owing to the war. Temporary arrangements were made, however, to overcome this difficulty. Considerable jungle clearing was found to be necessary, and also the erection of temporary cattle sheds to provide shelter, both of which were carried out by this Department. Owing to the lack of grass it was also necessary to arrange for artificial feeding. All these factors, together with an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, caused delay in transferring the cattle from Tatkôn to the new farm at Inbaung. Transfer of the cattle to Inbaung was begun on the 28th March 1941, and was still in progress at the end of the year under report. 3. The 4th meeting of the Stock Breeding Advisory Committee was held at the Tatkôn Farm on the 28th October 1940. This was the first meeting held by the Committee since it was re-constituted. The Committee inspected the stock on the farm and decided which animals should be culled, and also discussed the future policy to be pursued in connection with breeding operations. 4. Twenty-one undesirable animals were culled from the herd and disposed of for Rs. 420 by public auction, viz., 13 bulls, 5 cows, 2 heifers and one calf, because of predominance of Indian characteristics, bad conformation, and heavy worm infestation. 5. The general condition of the cattle remained quite good throughout the year, but artificial feeding was necessary the whole time. There was an outbreak of Blackquarter which caused 23 deaths before it was con- trolled by inoculation, and later all except seven animals passed through foot and mouth disease. Condition lost temporarily as a result of the latter disease was soon regained. Apart from the blackquarter cases there were only 8 other deaths during the year, due to Verminosis (3), accident (2), stunted growth and debility (1), snake bite (1) and cause unknown (1). 6. Five selected bulls between them carried out 69 services with selected cows, the objects beingFOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1941. 15 The number of stock at the end of the year was as follows :16 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA years ago. Vaccinated animals are not marked in any way, so that the actual number of re-vaccinated animals cannot be given with any degree of certainty. Probably the large majority of animals vaccinated this year were being done for the first time. It has not been possible by controlled experiments to ascertain whether the immunity lasts longer than four years, as all the original experimental animals at the Laboratory had been otherwise disposed of, but as the four-year immunity test was carried out with virulent blood it is considered that natural infection could be withstood for a much longer period. Field experience tends to support this view. However, repeat inoculations after four years are being given in the field when owners consent. No further report has been received from the Veterinary Expert, Bangkok, regarding progress with the provisional arrangements which had been made for the control of disease on the Thailand border opposite the Amherst District. On the Burma side of the border the immunised belt of cattle has been well maintained and there has been no necessity for the setting up of a quarantine station. Foot-and-mouth disease was rife but caused a negligible mortality. The Contagious Diseases Rules were amended during the year to permit mixing of sick and in-contact animals should the owner so wish. The compulsory segregation in force since 1936 had proved very unpopular, particularly as it had been found to be of little use in checking the spread of this disease. The amendment should result in outbreaks of the disease running their course more rapidly and the infected areas becoming clean again in a shorter time than formerly, and hence causing less interference with cultivation. As regards Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia it is still the exception for a definite diagnosis to be made, owing to the difficulty of obtaining material in suspected outbreaks. This is due to the fact that the majority of outbreaks are sporadic ones of very short duration, which more often than not subside before the arrival of the veterinary staff. In cases where it has been possible to obtain smears for diagnosis it is not infrequently observed that the Veterinary Assistant sending the smear suspects Anthrax but examination of the smear proves the case to be one of Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia, and vice versa. In some cases both the diseases have been "definitely diagnosed from the same area. In other cases, where ears have been sent in from the carcasses for a test on small laboratory animals, the latter have died although no Anthrax or Hæmorrhagic Septicaemia organisms have been found in them, probably due to decomposition having set in before the arrival of the ears at the laboratory. Since the issue of a reminder to the district veterinary staff on the preparation of ears for despatch there has been an improvement in this respect. For the above reason the policy of intensive double Hæmorrhagic
FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1941. 17 Septicæmia and Anthrax vaccination referred to in Chapter III, has been continued and an attempt has been made to assess its value by the collection of data indicating what effect, if any, it has had on reducing the combined mortality from these two diseases. The information is as yet incomplete, and the enquiries will be continued during the coming year. Where Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia vaccine has been given alone in proved outbreaks, and repeated in such areas before the out- break season, the mortality has in some cases fallen quite appreciably, the decrease being more particularly noticeable in those areas where epizootics had occurred. Anthrax vaccine used alone has also given good results. In one case, however, two ponies which had been twice vaccinated at an interval of six months, died of Anthrax four months after the second vaccination, the diagnosis being confirmed by microscopical examination. This happened in an area where the disease had been very persistent, killing cattle, ponies and elephants, viz., Kya-in Township of Amherst District. Normally the Anthrax vaccine is repeated only after twelve months. Glanders was, like last year, not reported from any district. No further progress had been made up to the end of the year under report with arrangements for testing the gharry ponies in the Mandalay Munici- pality with Mallein ; the new Municipal Committee having come to no decision on the matter. There are, however, indications that some- thing may be done in this direction during the coming year. Great difficulty was experienced in getting the gharry owners of Maymyo to bring their ponies for re-testing this year, the owners reluctance being due to the fact that compensation would not be paid for any reactors which had to be destroyed, the payment of compensation having been discontinued in 1932. A recommendation was therefore made to Government that the payment of compensation should be re-introduced and orders to that effect were shortly afterwards issued by Government. This should facilitate the application of the test in such places as Maymyo and Mandalay, where regular testing is very desirable. 3. The Fiscal Committee, 1938, recommended that more money be spent on the Veterinary Department, and the Committee on Expenditure on the Public Services, 1939-40, supported that recommendation. A scheme has accordingly been submitted for an increase in the superior staff of the Department, and is now under consideration by Government. A second scheme for still further increasing the Class III Service, viz., Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistants, and for the training of the former at Insein instead of at Madras, is also being elaborated, but the more crying need undoubtedly is for larger numbers of better qualified superior staff, both for field work and for research. It is hoped that adequate funds will be made available in order that the activities of this nation- building Department may be expanded in this way.
18 REPORT ON THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BURMA, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31ST MARCH 1941. 4. The department is again indebted to the Rangoon Turf Club for its generosity, which this time has taken the form of the presentation of an Inductotherm, costing Rs. 1,685. This apparatus has been installed at the Veterinary College, Insein, and has already proved very useful. 5. The staff of the department has, with few exceptions, worked well throughout the year, but it has been necessary to issue a reminder to the subordinate staff to carry out the requisite amount of touring. To facilitate this, and at the same time to encourage this staff to take a greater interest in the practical work in the villages, the amount of their office work has been appreciably diminished by the elimination or holding in abeyance of a number of relatively unimportant departmental forms and returns, the tediously laborious compilation of which had necessitated much time being spent in their offices which might have been more profitably spent on tour. 6. District Officers have again contributed very materially to the success achieved in the control and prevention of disease, for without their assistance the work of the department would have been rendered much more difficult, and this opportunity is taken of expressing thanks for the help so willingly given. A number of headmen and other individuals have been suitably rewarded for assistance rendered. A few others, unfortunately, have had to be punished by the District Officers for breaches of the Contagious Diseases Rules. 7. The cost of the department for the year was Rs. 6,02,252, compared with Rs. 6,00,425 last year. S. R. Rippon, Director of Veterinary Services, Burma.
