No. 158 OF 1895-96. IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Muktesar, viâ Peora, N. W. P July 24th, 1895. To THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIMLA SIR, I have the honour to forward, in continuation of my letter No. 132, dated 22nd June 1895, a further Summary of investigations conducted during 1894-95 in accordance with the instructions of the Government of India, R. & A., con- veyed in their letter No. 3151CONTENTS. I.I. SURRA. A.2 12. At the end of 1894, Surra appeared in the villages of Aurangpur, Nangala and Dadri in the Jhajjar Tehsil of the Rohtak district; 15 ponies died in the three villages in November. The country around is known as the Dabar, on account of the inundation and swamps. Ponies are very few there. (Veteri- nary Captain H. T. Pease.) 13. An outbreak of Surra occurred affecting horses in the Gurshanker Tehsil, South Punjab. (Pease.) 14. An outbreak took place amongst Cavalry horses when marching through Delhi in 1894-95; one squadron was left behind. (Pease). (ii). CamelsTABLE No. I.

Result6 From the above Table I it will be observed that of twenty-one (21) horses suffering from Surra, submitted to the Arsenical treatment, fifteen (15) were known to have suffered from the disease for periods varying from ten to thirty- five (10 to 35) days, previous to their admission to the Laboratory Hospital. Of the above fifteen (15) animals, six failed to survive for more than a fortnight after the treatment, was commenced, owing to their weak condition, brought about by the paroxysms of fever they had previously passed through. 2. In three (3) of the twenty-one (21) cases, the hæmatozoon re-appeared in the blood after an absence of 28, 2, and 70 days respectively, but in the case of Animal CXVII, in which the organisms re-appeared after two days, a sufficient reason is patent to account for its recurrence, in that the Arsenic was first ad- ministered just before the termination of an intermission, and a sufficient quan- tity of the drug had not been given to destroy the developing Trypanosoma, previous to the recurrence of a fresh paroxysm. 3. In the blood of two horses (Nos. CXXII and CXXIII) the hæmatozoon appeared a second time after the animals had been submitted to the Arsenical treatment, and it is of interest to observe, that in both the first recurrence took place after intermissions of 52 and 50 days, whilst the second recurrence occurred after intermissions of 50 and 30 days respectively. 4. It has previously been noted that the most common periods during treatment by Arsenic in which the hæmatozoon re-appears in the circulation of equines, whose systems are under the influence of the drug, is somewhere about the 25th, 50th, or 75th day of an intermission, i. e. subsequent to the dis- appearance of the organism from the circulation of the animal. This gives one an idea of the deterrent effect produced on the immature form of the Surra hæmatozoon, and its great tenacity of life, for in ordinary cases of Surra the in- termissions between the paroxysms, rarely if ever, exceed a maximum duration of seven days. 5. Horse No. LXXXIX, an Australian, whose cure was detailed in my last Annual Summary Report of July 1894, continued to thrive and gain in body weight. The difference in weight, during the period of disease and after cure was effected, was nearly three maunds or 240 lbs. This animal was treated, and the blood daily examined up to February 23rd, 18957 C.8 6. Daily microscopic observations of the blood should be made, and the number of organisms recorded on a chart for ready reference, together with the temperature, pulse and respirations of the patient, which should be taken three times daily, viz. 8 A.M., 1 P.M. and 5 P.M. 7. Most animals will take the drug in one to two pints of water from a bucket, without any trouble. If this be found occasionally impracticable, the Arsenic can be mixed with the corn and bran in the form of Liquor Arsenicalis ; but in obstinate cases the medicine will have to be administered to the animal in the form of a bolus or in a draught. 8. Acute Desquammative Nephritis is a common complication of Surra, but it must not contra-indicate the administration-of Arsenic, although the maximum doses cannot be maintained, otherwise the animal will have a relapse, and ulti- mately succumb to the disease. 9. Animals suffering from Surra, as a general rule, have voracious appe- tites. It has been found by practical experience that the following amounts of hay, corn, &c, are necessary for an Australian horse weighing 1,000 lbs. and over; for on this the animal keeps in fair condition and during convalescence puts on flesh rapidly9 E.10 (ii) during the incubatory period of the disease, (iii) during the paroxysms and intermissions until death. The weight of the animals under experiment was also ascertained at frequent intervals. 2. Ingesta.11 2. Rats were obtained from six localities during the year. The results registered . concerning the presence of the hæmatozoon in their blood from the different places, tallied very closely when the animals examined were sufficiently numerous for comparison. The percentage varied between 32.12 and 35.43 in animals taken from three localities. TABLE III.

It will be seen from the above table that the weight of the spleen increased (from a minimum in the absent cases) in regular gradation, according to the number of hæmatozoa present in the circulation of the rats. 6.
