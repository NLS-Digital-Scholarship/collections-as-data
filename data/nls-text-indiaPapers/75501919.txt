ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR. 1895-96. PART I.2 English stal- lions. 6. During the past year, 22 horses have been received from England, and, as will be found stated elsewhere, no deaths occurred on the voyage; the full number was therefore received in India; of these, two were sent to Bombay, the remainder being sent to Northern India. 7. Of the 22 imported, 18 were thoroughbreds, three were hackneys, and one was a half-bred. This Department has been fortunate in securing a most valuable addition to its strength in the 18 thorough-breds received during the past year, and I am of opinion that General Sir J. Watson is to be con- gratulated in having put such a good batch together. I would specially mention "Harvester," "The Dummy," "St. Porcaire," "Studley Royal," and "Government"; but in mentioning these I do not wish it to be understood that the rest were inferior. I have never been present at an allotment of stallions to the different provinces where the last horse selected showed so little difference when compared with the first, as these did on my allotment in April last; in fact they can best be described as a good level lot. 8. The only half-bred obtainable was "Orlando" by "Hilarious"; Dam, "Nance," by "Promised Land." This horse was purchased from Sir W. Gilbey, but was not the class of horse required for this country being long on the leg and light in bone. From Sir John Watson's letter it would appear that this class of horse is very difficult to obtain, and that this was the only one he could purchase last year. 9. Of the three hackneys imported, "Captious" and "The King" were just the class of horse required for this country, being small horses, measur- ing 15 and 15 hands one inch, respectively; they were also compact and very well bred. To ensure success in horse breeding operations, a certain number of hackneys will be required to guard against weediness, and if this class of horse is sent out when hackneys are indented for, success will be ensured. The third hackney, "Warfield Marshal," although thought a great deal of in England and being by the fashionable sire "Field Marshal," is the class of horse I wish to avoid as much as possible, being too big and too heavy. In addition to difficulty being found to make the zemindars avail themselves of the ser- vices of horses of this kind, I feel convinced that his produce will be unsuit- able to the conditions under which young stock is reared in this country. 10. During the year under review, two horses, two years of age, were sent out; these were three years' old on arrival in this country, and as all horses are kept in the depôt for nearly a year before being sent out, and as these young horses do very well at the depôt at Babugarh, I see no objection to a few being bought at that age; frequently it would mean that if a good horse of two years of age were seen by Sir J. Watson, he would be lost unless he was pur- chased at once. The Bombay Government, however, objected to take any horse under four years of age and it has, therefore, been decided that in future no stallion under that age, is to be sent to that Presidency, and Sir John Watson has been asked when allotting horses for Bombay, to be so good as to comply with that Government's request. Thorough-bred Australian stal- lions. 11. In the last Annual Administration Report, I stated that the Govern- ment of India had been pleased to sanction the importation of six thorough-bred Australian stallions, and that the commission had been entrusted to Mr. Madden of the firm of Krcrouse and Madden. These stallions were landed in Novem- ber last: the terms of the agreement were that they were to be landed at the shipper's risk, that they were to be inspected by me within one month of their landing, and that they were to be purchased only on the understanding that they fully came up to the standard given to Mr. Madden, and that they were approved of by me. I mention these points to show that the terms of the agreement are very advantageous to Government. The six stallions were landed at Madras in splendid condition, but I regret to state that one of them died short- ly after landing. I greatly regret that the Firm should have incurred this loss, especially as they carried out the order to my entire satisfaction. The Hon'ble Military Member, General Sir Henry Brackenbury, being in Madras at the time, I took the opportunity of showing them to him, and he fully agreed with me in saying that they were grand horses. The measurements agreed upon between Mr. Madden and myself were as follows:3 12. The following is a description of the horses landed:4 the Jumpers Flat Race of one mile three furlongs, he had to carry 13 st. 7 lbs. showing that he was known in Australia as a weight carrier. "Hegira" by "Emerald" by "Yattendon" out of "Goldstain" by "The Earl." This horse won many races, amongst which may be mentioned the Canterbury Park Handicap twice; the Moorfield, Newcastle, and other Handicaps; also the Rosehill Hurdle Race. He was six years' old when pur- chased and measured 71½ girth, and 81/4 below the knee. 16. The Government of India have been pleased to sanction the importation of six more thorough-bred Australians during the current year, and I feel that we cannot do better than to obtain sires of this class, as they possess, as a rule, better legs and feet than the English thorough-bred. Arab stallions. 17. The Arab market for horses has improved greatly during the year, and I am pleased to be able to report that I obtained a much better class of animals this year than I did last; in fact, I may say that of the 18 purchased, in addition to a number bought for Native States, the majority were big horses with good bone and substance, combined with quality. The best horses by far were purchased from Ali Bin Taleb, who is able to bring over the class of horse required, as his family rear them from colts, and also owing to the fact that he is a man of capital. Since concluding my purchases in the Bombay market, I have been pleased to find that the prices paid for the horses are likely to revive the Horse Trade in Bombay which requires most careful nursing. Mr. Omer Jamal, who on all occasions, does his utmost to assist me in obtaining the very best horses for Government, and to whom I would tender my thanks for all the assistance received from him during the past two years, has written to say that he anticipates a much better market for horses this year, which will give me greater selection; this he attributes to the fact that the importers have now learned that they will receive a fair remunerative price for any really good horse that they import. The highest price paid during the year was Rs. 4,017; this was for a beautiful Bay horse, five years of age, 145 From bills showing cost of landing and keeping of horses and donkeys in 1894-95, I find that the average was Rs. 37-15-5, and that after the adoption of the abovementioned system in 1895-96, that the average was Rs. 23-5-10, showing a saving of Rs. 14-9-7 on each animal. Transfer of Dera- jat from Balu- chistan to Pun- jab. 21. As in the remarks which will follow, frequent allusions will be made, in referring to the North and South Punjab, to changes which have occurred during the past year, owing to the transfer of the Derajat from Baluchistan to the Punjab, I deem it advisable to note that from 1st April 1895 the districts of Muzafargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan were added to the South Punjab, and those of Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan were added to the North Punjab; they having previously been in charge of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan. This change, in my opinion, was imperatively called for, as difficulties arose owing to one Superintendent having to work under two Governments or Administrations, and also owing to the distance dividing the Derajat from Baluchistan, much valuable time was lost. I feel confident that the change will prove greatly to the interests of horse breeding in these four districts. 22. The fact that the Derajat was removed from the charge of the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Baluchistan, has also resulted in that Officer being able to devote more time to his own Province, and the increase in horse breeding there, will, I think, show that the change has proved bene- ficial. 23. It was advisable to give a start to Baluchistan, but now that this has been done, I do not consider that the work is sufficient; I have therefore proposed that this officer should also be placed in charge of Sindh, relieving the Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay; this I consider would be judicious, as Sindh and Baluchistan could well be worked together, whereas, geographically considered, Sindh is too far distant from Bombay to allow of its being properly worked by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department of that Presidency. Number of stal- lions at stud work. 24. The number of stallions at stud work is shown in Table IV (page vii). By this Table it will be seen that:6 28. Our real horse breeding centres being North-Western Provinces, North and South Punjab, and Baluchistan, it is gratifying to note an increase as fol- lows:7 Captain Phillot, 3rd Punjab Cavalry, remarks, with reference to the re- mounts bought by him at Rawal Pindi:8 The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, re marks:9 regiments still buy largely in the Bombay and Calcutta markets; amongst others might be mentioned:10 Remounts for Native Cavalry. 51. There can be no doubt that the Native Cavalry experience some difficulty in obtaining remounts of four years of age; this is due to two causes11 "I think this is undoubtedly two years' old. Yearlings are very hard to judge unloss one has had a special training that way, but a two-year old is sufficiently developed to enable one to make a very fair guess at what he ultimately will turn out, and he has hardly had sufficient time to contract the faults induced by the system of spread-eagling them and which are so apparent in such a large proportion of the three and four-year olds. "(b) Average price. "Rs. 150 to Rs. 180 is I think a fair average price for a two-year old. "(c) Number of young stock to be bought annually. "This depends on the size of the run and the requirements of the regiment. We calculate our run to provide half our annual requirements. They are passed into the regiment at four or four and a half years, and into the ranks at five. The annual requirements are from 40 to 50 remounts, therefore 50 or 60 two-year olds and three- year olds should, allowing for casualties, keep up that supply. For instance, 30 two-year olds bought in 1895 would pass into the regiment in 1897, leaving 30 bought in 1896 (being then three years' old in 1897) for the 98 supply, and 30 fresh two-year olds to be bought. "(d) Acreage required per head of young stock maintained? "I am unable to answer this question of acreago. We have three large paddocks of about 20 acres each, but when grass operations are not in progress, the stock have the free run of the rukh which is 1,050 acres. I should think two and a half or three acres per head would probably be sufficient. "(e) Average cost of maintenance. "Our average cost is something under Rs. 40 per head per annum. Allowing for casualties we can put the animals into the regiment at an average of about Rs. 250. "(f) Best class of stock to purchase. "We have found the Norfolk Trotter stock on the run very apt to develop splints and we mean to buy as few of thom as possible in future." 59. I have entered more fully than I intended into this question, and although it may be urged that it is one which may be said to be somewhat beyond the province of this Department, still, I would urge that it is my duty to draw the attention of the Government of India to the large export of young stock from many of our best breeding districts, and as this would be one of the best means to check this enormous loss which is occurring annually, I deem it advisable to bring the matter forward. Scheme for the collection of horses at con- venient centres for purchase as Cavalry re- mounts. 60. With a view of endeavouring to bring Remount Officers and breeders more together and in order to obtain more remounts for the Native Cavalry, I decided to endeavour to have horses collected in different centres at times other than those at which the Horse Shows are held. As the district of Dera Ghazi Khan appeared to afford greater facilities and also to promise greater chances of success, an attempt was made in this district. The Deputy Commissioner very kindly undertook to collect as many as possible, and the Officers Com- manding 2nd and 5th Punjab Cavalry promised to send Officers to the various centres selected; but I regret to say that the result was a failure. 61. The Officer Commanding 2nd Punjab Cavalry reports as follows:12 the best Fairs, it will be seen how injurious to the interests of Government this must necessarily be, as naturally Government must pay an enhanced price, but not only does this operate injuriously as far as Government is concerned, but also horse breeding must suffer, as the breeder is paid much less by the dealer than he would obtain if he sold to the Remount Agent direct. I there- fore consider that I am right in describing the dealer as an enemy both to Government and the breeders generally. 64. A case occurred during the year in which a breeder of the Lahore district petitioned the Punjab Government, asking that orders might be issued that horses were to be bought direct from the zemindar breeders. The Director of Land Records in his report on the case states that the petitioner alleges nothing which is not lawful, but at the same time remarks:PART I.15 PART I.16 Showing an increase of 2,792 pony mares and 159 donkey mares when com- pared with last year. 75. I fear that this high percentage cannot be maintained for long, without injury to our donkey stallions; for this reason, I shall deem it necessary to recommend the Government of India to sanction an increase in the number of donkeys from 350 to 400. Demand for donkey stallions. 76. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, reports the demand for donkey stallions to be steady, several new stands and two new districts having been opened up. The Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, states:17 83. I have hitherto spoken of the country-bred and Persians and have shown that as yet we have only succeeded in obtaining animals fit to get bag- gage mules, it now remains for me to consider whether the remaining breed of donkeys on which we depend in India, are likely to produce Ordnance mules which are so much required. These breeds include the Italians and Cyprians. 84. In last year's Annual Administration Report, I pointed out that the Italians received by importation were not good, and from careful observations made this year, I have come to the conclusion that those received during the past year are not, generally speaking, the class of animals we require to pro- duce Ordnance mules of the necessary stamp for our Mountain Batteries. The question was referred to the two officers in charge of the North-West Province and Punjab Depôts. The former officer states as follows:18 88. This most important question will form the subject of a separate com- munication to the Government of India, and it will then be for consideration whether a supply cannot be obtained from other continental countries. I am of opinion that this question should be given the utmost consideration, as from my knowledge, especially of Spain, I feel convinced that better Jacks, more suitable for our requirements, could be obtained for the price now paid for Italians. Number of mules purchased by Government. 89. Table X (page xl) will show the number of mules purchased during the year. The Remount Department obtained 312, which is an excess of 174 over last year. The Commissariat Department bought 1,434 against 1,669, showing a decrease of 235: the reduction must, I think, be attributed to the fact that less mules were required owing to the return of a large number that had been specially bought for the Chitral expedition.
PART I.21 PART I.22 94. The number of mares branded in the North-Western Provinces was 391 against 725 last year. The decrease is due to the fact that the Superintendent toured so thoroughly through these Provinces last year that he branded every mare that was to be branded. Of those branded, 100 were known to be by Government sires and undoubtedly many others were also. 95. In the North Punjab, 913 were branded against 602 last year; a most satisfactory increase, especially when we take into consideration the following extract from the Superintendent's report:23 coverings by Government stallions granted for unbranded mares. In one district, Rohtak, 153 certificates were aranted by the Deputy Commissioner against 27 in the remaining districts. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North Punjab, in his paragraph 33 also expresses an opinion adverse to the grant of these certificates. "There can be little doubt that in this particular case the certificates were much too freely granted, and attention was duly called to the matter, and the Deputy Commissioner discontinued the practice. In so far as certificates were granted to inferior mares the action of the Deputy Commissioner is to be regretted. * * * * * * * * * * "I think it would be a mistake to abolish the certificate system which has so lately been introduced now, merely because one District Officer who was most anxious to further the cause of horse breeding in a backward district has made too free use of it. It certainly helps to induce District Officers to take an interest in horse breed- ing, and without the interest and co-operation of District Officers, the Civil Veterinary Department will accomp- lish far less than would otherwise be the case. "In my No. 1835, dated 11th November 1892, paragraph 2, in giving my opinion on the question of the grant of certificates, of which I was not greatly in favor, I recommended that a limit of 5 per Imperial stallion should be placed upon the number of certificates to be granted in any district. Had this suggestion been accepted the difficulties which have occurred in Rohtak would have been avoided. I also recommended then that these certificates should only be given in case the district had remained unvisited by a Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, for twelve months. Some such restrictions might be imposed now. Veterinary-Captain Nunn, whose opinion I have asked on this point, considers that certificates should not be granted at all by non-professional men, and I agree that, now the districts are much more regularly and systematically visited, the necessity for them is far less than it was." 102. The Government of India, in referring to this system, state:24 "Out of the total of 183 certificated mares before mentioned:25 Baluchistan is encouraging, especially when we note that in two years, the number of mares covered rose from 1,218 to 2,253. 111. The number shown as covered in Bombay refers only to horses. The numbers may be said to be identical with those of last year, 1,279 mares having been covered against 1,276 last year. No improvement is noticeable. This is to be regretted in Sind, which must be looked upon as the best horse breeding portion of this Presidency and, in which there is a steady decline. Proposal to remove prohibi- tion of sale of branded mares to Remount Offi- cers. 112. During the year under review, some important questions regarding the welfare of horse breeding in India have been discussed. 113. The first referred to the free trade in branded mares; this question was raised by the Punjab Government, and in a letter from the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, strongly urged that the restriction which now exists to the effect that branded mares are not to be purchased as remounts, should be removed. Although I trust that the day may come when it will be in our power to remove all restrictions, still, I feel that we are not in a position to do so at present; as it is, the dealers buy a number of our best branded mares and if they thought Native Cavalry Officers would buy them, they would add largely to their purchases in this direction and horse breeding would suffer materially. The restriction has been made as little irksome as possible by the rule relating to sale being altered so as to ensure no man being compelled to keep a branded mare. Superintendents are now empowered to grant certi- ficates to the owners of all mares that have been covered during two successive years enabling them to sell to Remount Officers, but, in addition to this, they have discretionary powers allowing them to grant certificates on other well founded grounds, such as scarcity of fodder, and an owner being unable to keep his usual number of brood stock. During my visits to the various Horse Shows and Fairs26 have held, calculated on the number of mares covered during the previous year, I have added a column to show this:27 of these officials has been suspected of neglect of duty or submitting wrong re- turns, has been most carefully enquired into with the result that:28 believe that the zilladars are frequently guilty of refusing to deliver produce certificates without receiving a gratuity for doing so; it will readily be under- stood that although this is known to exist, still, it is very difficult to prove. 132. During my tour through the horse breeding districts, I have made careful enquiries to endeavour to ascertain whether the number of foals said to be produced is, in any way, as bad as reported by the zilladars, and feel convinced that it is not the case. Amongst other reliable men, I have consulted Yakoob Khan, Rais of Khurja, Bulandshahr district, and also one of the darindahs of this Department; he informed me that at least 70 per cent. of the mares covered at his stand were in foal. 133. Jehan Khan of Khunda, Rawal Pindi district, one of the best breeders of that district and also a darindah of this Department, can prove that 50 per cent. of the mares covered at his stand are in foal. 134. With this evidence before us it is impossible to place any confidence in the Zilladars' Returns. 135. Another system of checking returns, through the Revenue Establish- ment of the North-Western Provinces and Punjab, is gradually being put into working order. Last year the system had not been properly started; during the year under review, it appears to have worked satisfactorily in the North- Western Provinces, and as the Patwaris of the Punjab did not appear to under- stand what was expected of them, explanatory notes to the forms in use were issued through the Director of Land Records. 136. On the working of this system, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, reports:29 men from the Lahore Veterinary College, who have no influence in the dis- tricts. Although I regret to have been compelled to rule that zilladars need not necessarily be veterinary assistants, still, I deemed it necessary to do so, and to direct that, in future, whenever possible, men of good families and therefore possessing some local influence, should be selected to fill these re- sponsible posts. 141. If any confirmation of my opinion, which is to the effect that although the statistics show bad working still that the actual produce is not unsatisfactory, is needed, I would point to the success gained in Baluchistan during the past year. 142. On 1st April 1895, four zilladars were appointed and the satisfactory results which we are able to show, I attribute to two causes:30 147. It is of course not to be expected that all abuses can be arrested at once, and still there are stands at which gross neglect is visible. The Superin- tendent instances the following case:31 average number of mares covered by each stallion daring his absence from the depôt, was as follows:32 158. This is very satisfactory, giving as it does, an increase of 639 colts castrated by both Imperial and District Salutris. 159. The fact that of 3,553 colts castrated by Imperial and Provincial Vete- rinary Assistants, only five died, giving, as it does, a death rate of only 0.14 per cent., must be considered very satisfactory. 160. I am glad to find that castration has made a start in the Madras Pre- sidency. In Salem, 134 ponies were castrated against 116 last year, whilst in Coimbatore 98 were operated on against none last year. I trust to see this still further extended, as without it, the pony-breeding operations, in which the Madras Government takes a great interest, cannot possibly succeed.
PART I.35 PART I.36 percentage of known results, as having held, to the number of mares covered:- Mule produce. Number foaled per stal- lion employed. Percentage of produce to mares covered. 1894-95. 1895-96. North-Western Provinces ... 13.87 18.16 36.33 North Punjab ... ... 16.60 17.41 21.51 South Punjab ... ... 15.36 12.32 17.76 Deccan ... ... 6.80 1.57 10.16 Guzerat ... ... 8.57 6.00 35.29 Sindh and Cutch ... ... 5.22 4.94 12.95 168. The working in the North-Western Provinces shows an improvement; the Punjab is very much as it was last year; but Bombay shows a great fall- ing off.
PART I.39 PART I.40 This is to be regretted. This was the only show at which there was no competition. 179. This must be looked upon as a purely dealers' Fair, and owing to this fact it was determined last year not to offer any prizes for competition, from Imperial Funds. 180. The number of animals attending the Fair was 10,912 against 10,040 last year, showing an increase of 872. 181. The District Funds having allotted the sum of Rs. 300 to be dis- tributed in prizes, the amount was awarded as follows:41 grounds of the North-Western Provinces. I am glad to say that the position this year was entirely reversed, and this Department must thank the District Officers for having effected this change and for the success which attended this show. 191. General Sir John Watson, V.C., and I attended this show. 192. The statistics show that whilst last year only 260 head of stock, the property of zemindars, was present, on this occasion 502 were brought in; and that 539 competed for prizes against 364 last year; this is most satisfactory. The actual numbers that attended did not show a material increase, viz., 1,100 against 997; this was entirely due to the fact that the numbers brought by dealers were considerably less. 193. The number of remounts purchased was as follows:42 204. Captain Westlake, the Remount Agent, attended the show and pur- chased 7 head of young stock. This officer reports as follows:43 "I was told that they take them to Bengal, feed them well for a year or two, and sell them either at Sonepore fair or in the Calcutta market." Meerut (Nau- chandi) Horse Show. 218. It gives me the greatest pleasure to be able again on this occasion to note a further development of this, one of the best shows in the North-West- ern Provinces. 219. Last year I was able to do so, but I certainly thought that we then had arrived at the extreme limit to which improvement was possible; this year again a marked improvement is noticeable all round. 220. The following statistics will speak for themselves:44 229. With reference to this Fair, I feel I cannot do better than to quote the words of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinery Department, who attended it. He says:45 239. Captain Weller, 14th Bengal Lancers, says:46 251. This officer shows 31 horses in his Remount Roll as having been purchased at Amritsar at an average of Rs. 205. He adds:47 high, viz., Rs. 278, but this was partly due to the fact that five horses were pur- chased for Native officers at enhanced prices. 266. The President, Special Judging Committee, reports as follows:48 276. Although the numbers that were actually present fell to 179 when compared with last year, still, 20 more competed for prizes. 277. Castration requires to be pushed if we wish to make horse breeding a success. It has made a start; in 1892-93 none were castrated; in 1893-94, 34; in 1894-95, 21; and up to February 1896, 55. I hope to be able to note a still greater improvement next year. Dinanagar Horse Fair. 278. This fair was held on the 26th and 27th March 1896. As stated last year, it must rather be considered a local gathering than a district fair. No prizes are awarded by the Imperial Government, but the district, on this occasion, awarded the sum of Rs. 416, of which Rs. 337 were given to horse stock, and Rs. 79 to cattle. 279. The district of Gurdaspur is one of the most backward in the Punjab in the way of horse-breeding, and on this occasion the numbers which attended the fair fell from 268 to 178, this is, however, attributed to the scarcity of fodder. 280. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, who attended, reports:49 to the fact that this Show clashed with Batesar, but whilst agreeing with him partially. I think the cause must be also sought in the fact that fodder had been very scarce. I am all the more inclined to attribute the falling off to this cause as a Native Officer reports, " last year the horses were in good condition, as compared with the present year; this year the season was dry." 288. One of the best features of this district is the deep interest taken in horse breeding by the District Board; last year they purchased a very good Arab and this year they have bought one of the best of those selected by me in Bombay. 289. To demonstrate the extent to which this most useful adjunct to horse breeding has spread in Hansi, I extract the following from the report by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department:50 mares existed, and considering that in last year's Annual Administration Re- port fears were expressed that this show would have to be closed, it is doubly gratifying to find that no such fear need now be entertained. This is entirely due to the interest shown by Captain Douglas, the Deputy Commissioner, to whom the thanks of this Department are due for the successful Show held this year. 301. There were 986 animals present as compared with 680 in 1894-95. For the last five years the figures are as follows :51 Jhelum Horse Show. 309. This Show was held on the 23rd and 24th October 1895. The Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department, is of opinion that these dates are too close to those on which the Amritsar (Dewali) Fair is held, and suggests that they should be altered; this matter will be referred to the local authorities. 310. This was the first Show held at Jhelum for 12 years, except a local Show held as an experiment in 1893, and as such it must be looked upon as having been fairly successful. 311. At first it was proposed to hold Shows alternately at Jhelum and Gujrat; as both are, in my opinion, important breeding districts, I considered that this would have been a mistake. I trust that the re-establishment of this Show will give an impetus to horse breeding in the Jhelum district. I attended and was disappointed not to see more of the Chakwal mares and stock in the Show. On this point the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, reports as follows:52 Department, attributes to the scarcity of fodder, owners not being able to get their animals in show condition. This officer adds:53 324. The branded fillies and fillies of two and three years of ageare very highly spoken of by the Judging Committee, also by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, who describes them as shapely with bone and qua- lity; this augurs well for the district if the present interest is only maintained. 325. Castration, I am glad to see, is progressing in this district, 64 geldings competed. 326. Remounts.- A marked improvement is noticeable this year, for whilst only eight were obtainable last year for Native Cavalry, 11 were obtained for this Branch of the service, 14 for Imperial Service Troops, 7 mules for Com- missariat and Transport Department, and one was purchased by the Remount Agent for British Cavalry. 327. Whilst attending this show I noticed the stock of one particular stal- lion to be exceedingly bad. He evidently is a good foal-getter, as some of his stock was to be seen in nearly every class, and so bad was it that it could be picked out by its shape and color. Considering that such a horse should not be allowed to cover mares, I ordered him to be castrated and sold. The horse's name was " Venturesome " a Norfolk Trotter, and although he was a small compact horse still he was totally wanting in breeding and had a very short thick neck with heavy shoulders. Rawalpindi Horse Fair. 328. Held nominally from the 2nd to 4th April, but virtually com- menced on 18th March 1896. I specially note this as it may in a measure account for the failure of the Fair. 329. Taken altogether this Fair was most disappointing, as when the Judg- ing Committee assembled on the day appointed, it was found that for a large Fair as this usually is, there were comparatively speaking, few horses to judge. For although the numbers that attended and that competed for prizes are said to have been much the same as last year, still there were but few horses on the show ground. 330. A dead set was made by the dealers who bought up all the young stock possible and removed them to Serais. This evidently was done with a view of cornering the Remount Department; this will account for the fact that only one head of young stock was bought by the Remount Agent, and although many of these youngsters bought at Rawalpindi by the dealers were afterwards purchased at Amritsar by the Remount Agent, still, this must result in a loss to the breeder and to Government. 331. One dealer bought 27 horses and young stock and 8 mules, but in addi- tion to these, 40 mules and 22 horses were despatched to Amritsar before the Fair was advertized to commence, viz., from 27th March to 1st April 1896. This led me to ask the Deputy Commissioner to confine the Fair to 4 days, and also to ask the Director, Army Remount Department, to notify to Deputy Commis- sioners the date on which Remount Agents will arrive and the number of young stock that he will be prepared to purchase; if such notices are widely circu- lated next year, it will put a stop to the complaints made by the zemindars, who are led astray by false reports circulated by the dealers, either to the effect that the Remount Agent will not attend the fair or that he will only buy a few horses. 332. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, reports as fol- lows:54 Shahpur Horse Show. 333. This show was held from the 19th to 21st March 1896, and fully main- tained its character of being one of the best, if not the best, in North Punjab. As far as numbers go, they were much the same as last year, there being an increase of 114 in the numbers which attended and also a slight increase in the numbers competing for prizes. 334. But it is not of numbers in such a show as Shahpur that one should speak, it is of the quality of the stock. When it is considered that 262 branded mares and fillies entered the judging ring and that nearly all had 2 strains of English or Arab blood, it will be understood that this exhibition alone proved that Shahpur is a horse breeding district of the first class. 335. The branded mares either in foal or with foal at foot were a marvellous lot with great bone and quality ; the same may be said concerning the branded fillies, in these 3 strains of thoroughbred blood was common and in one case a filly was shown possessing 5 strains of Arab blood. 336. No class of horse is perfect, and this applies equally to the Shahpur mares; many have extraordinary long hind pasterns. Orders were issued to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, to be very careful in the selection of stallions for this district, also to watch carefully the results of continuous thoroughbred strains and to guard against any weediness in the- stock, and if noticed, to introduce good Arab strains. 337. Nineteen beautiful youngsters were purchased by the Remount Agent who expressed himself much pleased with the stock. 338. Twenty-three remounts were purchased for Native Cavalry, prices ranged high, but the high character borne by the remounts bred in this district warrant these prices. An old Native Officer remarked to me in conversa- tion:55 343. The most noticeable feature of this show was the enormous improve- ment in quality; this was specially noticeable in the yearling and 2-year old classes. The same improvement was equally noticeable in the produce by District Board stallions. This district has taken a strong lead in the provision of these stallions and 34 head of young stock by these sires were exhibited. 344. The Deputy Commissioner complains greatly about the absence of Re- mount Officers. The time will come when these Officers will attend and if the improvement which is noticeable is maintained, they will be able to obtain good serviceable remounts. On this occasion the Remount Agent purchased a particularly well shaped filly by an Arab sire. Abolition and postponement of Horse Shows in the Punjab. 345. This now completes the review of all Horse Shows and Fairs held in the Punjab during the past year ; the results must be looked upon as having been most satisfactory. 346. The Sialkot Show was abolished as it did not promise to develop well, and as the mares and young stock of this district compete in Gujrat which is only a short distance off, it was felt that the abolition of this show would not prove detrimental to the interests of the district. 347. The Shows at Delhi and Kurnal were not held owing to the scarcity of fodder. This is to be regretted. The same argument would have held good in most districts of the Punjab, but still the Shows were held and were successful. The money which had been allotted as prizes for these Shows was transferred to more deserving districts, viz., to Bulandshahr in the North-Western Pro- vinces, and to Sibi in Baluchistan. RAJPUTANA. 348. The only Fair held in Ajmere-Merwara and attended by Veterinary Captain Hagger, Principal, Ajmere Veterinary School, was that of Pokhur. Ar- rangements will, I trust, be made during the ensuing year for this officer to visit all important Horse Fairs in Rajputana, or at least as many as he can possibly attend without allowing this duty to interfere with that which must be looked upon as the most important, viz., the Ajmere Veterinary School. This matter will be settled in communication with the Agent to the Governor General, as soon as it is known what amount of money is available for this offi- cer's travelling expenses. Pokhur Horse Fair. 349. This Fair was held from the 29th October to 2nd November 1895. The number of horses that attended was greater than it had been for the 6 preceding years, but although this was the case and although 487 were registered as suit- ablefor military purposes, no remounts were obtainable for the Native Cavalry. 350. Veterinary Captain Hagger, Principal, Ajmere Veterinary School, who attended this Fair, reports as follows: 56 India. In my review of last year's Fair, I stated that I would recommend the discontinuance of prizes from Imperial funds ; this was done this year and it certainly had no deleterious effect on the Fair. 354. No reliance can be placed on actual figures quoted as the number of animals attending. On this point, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary De- partment, Bengal, states:57 "Here then we have a market where we can find a large and steadily increasing number of mules, of good hardy constitution, for a very reasonable average price; and if: once we break faith with these people, it will take years to win back their confidence. This will be a serious loss, because with the increase in the purchase of mules there will be a corresponding increase in the importation of wool, which, I am informed, reached a total of 30,000 maunds last year. This then should be another reason why the mela ought to be encouraged." "Five hundred rupees were sanctioned for prizes by the Civil Veterinary Department. The money was distributed among the best animals purchased by the Transport Officer, and was divided into 32 prizes. In the appendix will be found a list of: prize-winners with the respective amounts. "I consider the animals purchased this year are of better quality than those obtained in 1894. This may be due to the larger number brought in for selection." "There were 48 ponies brought in for sale, and these were of a very good stamp ; but I regret to say that although prizes were offered for stallions, only two wretched entire tattoos were shown. No prizes were there- fore given to them, as it was considered that it would be inadvisable to reward these animals, and thus discourage their use as stallions." " There were several mules which would have done for Artillery purposes, and three, which were really fine animals. The Remount Agent authorized me to purchase under advice from the Officer Commanding the Mountain Battery at Jellapahar. I therefore telegraphed to him to know the minimum measurements of a suitable animal, and received a reply that the minimum measurements for an Ordnance mule was58 367. In my last Annual Administration Report, I stated that the importers of the Northern Horse class asked that they might be brought into direct contact with the buyers, i.e., that the Native Cavalry should buy from them direct and not through dealers in India. The complaints on these grounds are greater this year then ever. I know the argument advanced will be that Native Cavalry do not like the Northern Horse, but against this I urge that they will buy them from the dealer, as otherwise the dealers would not invest in this class of horse as they do now. The result must be that if the importers do not derive the benefits from the full price that can be paid by Native Cavalry, or, in other words, if the profits are to go to the dealers, this trade must ultimately suffer, as the importers will find that it does not pay them. 368. The demand for country-bred horses, outside Military Circles, is in- creasing annually. We know that all Tramway Companies are buying largely and, owing to the improvement in country-bred horses, a large trade is springing up in Calcutta and as the improvement becomes more marked, the demand may be expected to increase. We cannot therefore allow a single market that promises well to fall off, and this will most certainly be the case with the trade in Northern Horses at Quetta if the importers find that Cavalry Officers do not attend. 369. The Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, in forwarding the reports of the Political Agent and the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, on this Show, remarks as follows, with reference to the absence of Native Cavalry Officers:59 to Quetta is opened and the distance is less, I have no doubt that a further reduction might be made. It will therefore be seen that the cost of transit for regiments at Multan and the Frontier would not be greater, if as much, as it is from, say Rawal Pindi, where these regiments buy. 372. Hitherto I have only dealt with the Northern horse trade, but we must not lose sight of the fact that we have also to deal with the important ques- tion of the indigenous stock bred in Quetta-Pishin districts. As the quality of this class of stock can best be judged by the number available for British Caval- ry, it is pleasing to note that the Remount Agent, Captain Birdwood, was able to buy 27 head of young stock as against 12 last year. These were excellent, showing both quality and bone, and were well grown for their ages. 373. Amongst the batch bought by the 5th Bombay Cavalry were eight very nice remounts, all of which were bred in Quetta-Pishin. This is encour- aging, as it proves that the breeders are beginning to keep their young stock until such an age as they can be bought by Native Cavalry. 374. The brood mares, of which 64 competed, were very good ; and the young stock exhibited, although fewer in number than last year,were, generally speaking, excellent, and showed breeding combined with bone and substance. 375. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, in his report on this Horse Show, states:60 good class of horse which owes its superiority to a large admix- ture of Arab blood. These are expensive and difficult to obtain and the dealers can make but little profit when sold at Native Cavalry remount prices. The Khorasan horse which comes to India is mostly obtained from the breeder direct. Those intend- ed for the Bombay market are marched to Bunder Abas where they are shipped. Those for the Fairs in Sindh are marched, viá Herat and Kandahar. They are collected in the Quetta- Pishin Valley and are got into condition for sale. They are quick active horses, showing a certain amount of quality, with a good rein and shoulders, and vary from 14-2 to 15-2 in height. Some few are inclined to be long in the back with upright joints, this no doubt being due to bad Turkoman blood. They are docile and easily broken, stand heat well, and less liable to skin disease than Cabulis. The Native Cavalry Regi- ments in Sindh are mounted almost entirely on horses of this class and they speak very highly of them for the particular country in which these Regiments are stationed. That they are fast enough for Native Cavalry, was proved by the late Inspector-General of Cavalry, who galloped a squadron of the 5th Bombay Cavalry, composed entirely of these horses, over a measured quarter of a mile in 36 seconds. That Officer also tested their marching capabilities very highly and was more than satisfied with the results. The best are bought by the Regiments in Sindh, the Lahore dealers who supply them to Regiments in Bengal and Bombay, and the Calcutta and Bombay Tramway Companies. The Managers of the various Tramway Companies like this class of horses, saying that they are easily kept in condition, that they do better and live longer than the Walers, also that they are less liable to sickness and sunstroke; further, that the mortality is less, under conditions of hard work, than any other class of horse. The Calcutta Tramways have 900, the Bombay Tramways 20 per cent., and Karachi 90 per cent. Reports received from Native Cavalry Regiments may be classified as follows:61 we have a horse capable of standing fatigue and great heat, one easily kept in condition, and as such, I consider him to be far superior to the cheap Aus- tralian. Sibi Horse Show. 381. This Show held from the 10th to 13th February 1896, maintained the high character which it has gradually acquired during the past few years. 382. The brood mares showed great excellence and most of the prize- winners would have held their own in any Show ring in England. I have only to state that 393 were exhibited to prove that this part of Baluchistan promises to be one of the best breeding centres in India. 383. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, expected a vast falling off in the number of brood mares attending this Show, as, whilst on tour during the winter, he had branded 400 mares many of which would have come in to the Show to be branded and which would have competed for prizes; instead of a decrease there was an increase of 77. 384. The young stock again was a most noticeable feature of the Show. 310 competed for prizes being an increase of 30 on last year. When I say that I would not have hesitated to put a single one of these 310 into a run with a view of their becoming either British or Cavalry, their excellence can well be understood. 385. With reference to the class of stallion most suitable for the mares of this part of the country, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, states:62 389. The Remount Agent, however, was able to secure 17 head of young stock against 11 last year. With reference to these, Veterinary Captain Maxwell says:63 SINDH HORSE SHOWS. Shikarpur Horse Show. 397. This Show was held on 13th January 1896. The total number exhibited amounted to 876 against 1,389 at Jacobabad last year. This Show was disappointing, both in the number of brood mares and young stock exhibited. The fillies were, however, of good quality. 398. The redeeming feature connected with this Show was the number of remounts obtained. One hundred and fifty-five were purchased, 48 of which were by Government sires. Eight head of young stock were bought for the Ahmednagar Remount Depôt. 399. The mules exhibited were a good lot; 27 were purchased by the Com- missariat Department, and 13 for Regimental Transport. 400. The Sindh Horse Show is held alternately at Jacobabad and Shikarpur. There can be no doubt that Jacocabad is in every way a more suitable centre for holding the Show, as the best breeders are in the immediate neighbourhood, and it is hoped that some arrangement will be arrived at whereby this Show will always be held there. Moro Horse Show. 401. This Show fell off in numbers. Seven hundred and eighty-two animals were present against 1,155 last year; this the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, attributes to the fact that the date fixed for this Show clashed with the important religious festival held at Shewan. 402. Only 18 remounts were purchased this year against 74 last year. This falling off is attributed to the fact that few purchasing officers attended. 403. Thirteen mules were purchased for the Commissariat Department. Talhar Horse Show. 404. The numbers fell from 907 in 1894-95, to 791 during the year under review. This is attributed by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, to the fact of more careful classification. 405. Mule breeding has been started by locating a donkey stallion in the district. 406. Five remounts were purchased by the Hyderabad Police. Bhuj Horse Show. 407. The numbers fell slightly at this Show. Four hundred and eighty- eight were exhibited against 518 last year. This is attributed to the want of forage and great scarcity that has prevailed in Cutch during the year. 408. The young stock was reported to have been good, but badly done. Of those exhibited, the Remount Agent purchased 5. MADRAS. Tiruppur Pony Show. 409. This Show was held on 7th June 1895, and must be looked upon as having been more successful than that held in 1894. The following is the number of exhibits in each class :64 "It was noticed that more covering certificates were produced at this Show than at previous ones; but there is still room for improvement in this respect." "It was observed that in Class II not a single colt appears to have been gelt. The majority were quite old enough to do harm. The judges would suggest the advisability of their being castrated as soon, after twelve months' old, as possible." "The judges consider that pony-breeding in this district promises so well, has been in force for so long a period, and that the ryots take such a keen interest in this industry, that there is no reason why, with a little more encouragement from Government, horses suitable for Native Cavalry should not be bred here at no remote period ; for instance, the colt which obtained first prize in Class II was by the Arab " Sultan," was 13 months old, measured 13 hands 2 inches, and 6½ inches below the knee, and was full of quality and substance; the animal would certainly be 14 hands 3½ inches as a five-year old, if properly cared for, and would compare favourably with the majority of young stock bred in the north. Rs. 200 was offered for him by a private individual and refused by the owner. This the judges believe is more than the Government pay for yearling colts up-country." "Among the brood mares was a mare ten years old by " Parfait Amour" (Government stallion), the model of a pony brood mare ; she has taken many prizes and looks now as fresh and well as she did as a three year old ; a daughter of hers took third prize in the brood mare class." "The stallions appear to be the right sort for the work, short and compact with blood, bone, and sub- stance, especially " Sultan," the grey No. 11, and the bay No. 9 (Mistrust)." 411. With reference to that portion of the above extract in which the Judges feel sanguine that horses suitable for Native Cavalry might be bred in this district at no remote period, the Board of Revenue, in their Resolution dated 3rd July 1895, say:65 Special Judging Committees. 415. At the commencement of this review I mentioned that a Special Judging Committee had been sanctioned for the North-Western Provinces, and Oudh, and another for the Punjab. This was the first occasion on which these Committees have assembled. That in the North-Western Provinces & Oudh consisted of:66 423. In the first place it was not received with that cordiality with which the North Western Provinces Committee was received. To show that the Special Judging Committee was not received with much cordiality in the Punjab, I might note that although the letter from the Government of India, Military De- partment, sanctioning its appointment, was forwarded to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, with a request that he would circulate it for the information of all District Officers concerned, still Local Committees, composed of Military Officers were assembled at Umballa and Multan, and another was about to be appointed at Rawalpindi. 424. There was also a latent feeling that the authority of the Deputy Com- missioner was being over-ridden. Two Deputy Commissioners, viz., Mr. Young- husband and Captain Douglas object to the Special Judging Committee on various grounds, which, if carefully analysed will, I think, be found not to be in any way objectionable. 425. The Deputy Commissioner of Umballa takes quite another view of the matter. He says:67 the number and class of animals attending have been found worthy of more prizes than the previous year's grant could afford. This increase was met by a corresponding decrease at those Shows where the number of animals compet- ing was less than those of the previous year. Under this head are also shown the amounts sanctioned last year for Batesar, Etawah, Hurdwar, Pokhur, and Sialkote Horse Shows and the Sonepore Fair; all of which were omitted from this year's list for the reasons which have already been assigned. The increase and decrease were as follows:68 that Major MacIvor, the Deputy Commissioner, represented that the grant was insufficient; the result of this year's Show, at which 393 mares and 310 head of young stock were present, fully justified the extra grant. 436. The allotments for the various Fairs and Shows now stand:69 Note 4 of the Rules for the guidance of Judging Committees runs as fol- lows:70 440. The following statement will show the number of remounts and young stock purchased at fairs and shows during the past three years:PART I.73 PART I.74 The above will plainly show the effects of over-work caused by extra cul- tivation in the North-Western Provinces Depôt. Balance sheet of cultivation oper- ations. 445. Tables XVII and XVII (a), pages lxviii to lxx are balance sheets of cultivation operations carried out at the North-Western Provinces and Punjab Depôts. The profits of the former amount to Rs. 1,866-12-4 and of the latter, Rs 811-0-7. These figures do not compare very favorably with those of last year, which amounted to Rs. 3,579-9-5 and Rs. 1,091-14-11, respectively; but on comparing the figures of the last 2 years, representing the actual expenditure incurred in connection with the growing of crops, and the outturn, it will be seen that while the expenses, especially under the head " Farm Labour" have been considerably curtailed, the yield, has been maintained when the reduced area under cultivation in 1895-96 is taken into account. Return of farm animals. 446. Table XVIII (page lxxii) shows the number of farm animals present on 1st April 1895, and remaining on 31st March 1896. Casualties. 447. Table XIX (page lxxiii) shows the number of casualties amongst the farm animals, by which it will be seen that only one died. On this point, the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, states that the health of the farm animals was remarkably good and that there was not a single case of disease. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Provinces and Oudh, states:75 Guinea grass. "The area under Guinea grass was ¾ acres. The yield was good, there being 330 maunds 23 seers. It is a capital green fodder and is much liked by the horses. We usually give it chopped up, with lucerne and hay. Carrots. "Two bighas were sown under English and one under indigenous seeds. The seeds were sown in August on a loomy soil. 73 maunds 33 seers of country carrots were obtained and 60 maunds of English. "Three years ago English seeds were obtained from Messrs. Sutton & Sons, and since then we have been using the acclimatized seed. This year, the roots obtained were larger and better than on either of the previous years. Hay. "There were 1,200 maunds of hay made during the year, all of it being of excellent quality. "We got a good supply of hay and bedding grass from the Hapur encamping ground, but not as much as on the previous year, for the reason that we have turned the encamping ground into a run for the young stock from the Depôt for 9 months of the year; as you know the encamping ground is over four miles from the Depôt, but owing to the kind assistance given us by Rai Ram Chander Sahai, the Tehsildar of Hapur, we have no difficulty in making and getting away our hay, and keeping our young stock there. Moth. "The area under moth cultivation was 1½ bighas. The yield being 3 maunds of seed and 7 maunds of bhoosa. This pulse grows well on bad land and requires very little previous cultivation, one or two ploughings being sufficient; the seed is sown broadcast at the rate of 4 seers to an acre. The seed and bhoosa were given to the farm animals whilst they were doing hard work, and they seemed to do well on it and keep in good condition. Natives have a prejudice against it, it being reputed to produce worms in the bowels. Barley. "The area under barley cultivation was 7 kutcha bighas. The six rowed variety was sown, (Hordemon Hexasticliom). The yield was 6 maunds 12 seers. A poor outturn, which was due to late sowing and the attack of a fungus resembling smut. Lathyrus Sylvestris. "One quarter bigha was sown for experimental purposes; the seeds germinated but the young plants died out gradually, no cause being visible. Another trial will be given this year. Oats. "There were 3½ acres under oat cultivation, and off this, 61 maunds 29 seers were fed off green, and besides we got 75 maunds of oatseed and 200 maunds straw. This crop had to be irrigated. Indian corn. "There was one acre under Indian corn cultivation. The yield being 7 maunds 22 seers. Gram. "There were six acres of land under gram cultivation, and from this we got 50 maunds gram and 30 maunds bhoosa. The gram before being sown was smeared with common oil, this is supposed to preserve the seed and prevent attacks of parasites, etc. The grain was of a rich brown color and of excellent quality. KaranjnaHedge. "The expense of keeping up mud walls in the Depôt is very great, as they have to be renewed every year. "Colonel Hallen procured some Karanjna seed and had it sown besides one of the mud walls; it grew up very quickly, making a fairly good fence after three years growth. "The stem requires to be cut and laid close to the ground when young, and I believe if this is done for a few years, it will make a capital fence. The seeds have been preserved, and this year, during the rainy season, they will be sown along the ring fence of the Depôt." PUNJAB FARM. Lucerne. "Two acres were again utilised for the cultivation of this valuable perennial; the ontturn aggregated 1,831 maunds as against 1,692 maunds produced last year. I attribute the increase to a better quality of manure, pre- pared according to the system recommended by Mr. Benson. "Again, this year, as last, another acre of old lucerne was rooted up and new seed put down; this yielded one cutting before the 31st March 1896 and promises well. Guinea grass. "In last year's report I recorded that a ¼ acre of this grass was sown in No. 10 paddock near the well and the old field abandoned; this has proved a great success; the small plot yielding l,090 maunds, which is very satisfactory and another proof of the superiority of manure preserved on the new principle. Oats. "Only a small plot was grown this year, the reason being that No. 10 well has failed to supply water re- quisite for more extensive cultivation, notwithstanding that it has been well cleaned. The yield from the one acre shown was 370 maunds, and being a small quantity was fed off green. Gram. "Four acres were sown which yield 53 maunds gram and 42 maunds bhoosa; the outturn was not so good as was at first expected, the prevalence of hot winds stunted the growth long before it sufficiently matured to withstand them, and a scarcity of rain added much to the deterioration of the grain; it was found that most of the pods were either empty or contained small seed. Barley. "An outturn of 15½ maunds of barley and 22½ maunds bhoosa was got from 76 Hay. "2,200 maunds of hay were saved during the year under review, of this, 600 maunds were obtained by pur- chase, another 600 maunds from the Opeihra encamping ground, and the rest from the paddocks comprised in the Punjab Depôt. "That part of No. 1 west paddock, mentioned in last year's report, was again cultivated this year, as the coarse grasses and weeds had not been thoroughly eradicated. "The sowing of the Opeihra encamping ground with 'Anjana' and other grass seeds was completed. And the supply of hay got from there was fair in quantity but of good quality; this being the first time, a larger amount could not be expected; I am, however, very sanguine of better results in future. Every endeavour is being made to improve the grass and the land. Manure. "Three pits on Mr. Benson's principle have been erected with galvanized iron roofings and the thatches of the old sheds were replaced by zinc ones. Two urine carts were also provided. The increased outturn of crops manured from these pits is certainly a recommendation of their utility, and for their continuance, and to my mind a proof of the good quality of the manure; indeed, I consider the pits an invaluable addition made to the Agri- cultural operations carried on by the farm."

PART I.87 PART I.88 Again, 10 horses were found to be affected in the Arab and Commission stables; the same remarks apply to these horses as to those detected on board ship. But, as affecting the City of Bombay, the system adopted by owners of glandered horses, of turning them loose in the streets should be most severely dealt with when their owners can be discovered, and I am pleased to see that one Arab dealer was fined Rs. 25 for neglecting to give information to the Veterinary Inspector of Police of a horse belonging to him being glandered. During the year, 7,147 horses were inspected at the harbour, showing an increase of 726 as compared with 1894; this large importation of horses will prove the necessity for increased vigilance on the part of the Authorities at Bombay, if it is desired to prevent the extension of the disease to the many parts of India to which these horses are sent. North-Western Provinces. 455. Glanders occurred on the Saharanpore Rajpur Dàk line, also at Lucknow, Cawnpore, and Saharanpore. Ten horses were affected and all were destroyed. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, North-Western Pro- vinces and Oudh, states:89 The case alluded to above, occurred at Sonepore. On this point, Veterinary Captain Gunn reported as follows :90 The most important portion to my mind is the extension of the Act to the whole of India which, as already stated, will enable the Local Government to deal at once with cases when they occur. "SURRA." 459. The following is a resume of the outbreaks of " Surra" reported during the year, prepared by Dr. Lingard, the Imperial Bacteriologist, chiefly from reports submitted by the Assistant to the Inspector General, Civil Veteri- nary Department.From this it will be evident that great strides have been made in our knowledge of the distribution of this disease. The fact of the occurrence of such a fatal malady passing unreported and its diagnosis not being made although well known to the people under the names of " Pheta" " Purana," " Zahrbad," etc., indicate the necessity of prosecuting the enquiries connected with the Bacteriological Survey and the record of vernacular names of disease. With regard to the submission of reports, Dr. Lingard remarks:91 Umballa.92 Balabgarh Tehsil.93 Jhagghar, Jahangerpur, Malerna, Kakur. These villages used to be full of camels, but few remain at present and many of the people have been ruined from the losses caused by this disease.

(i) Recognition of the disease by the natives.PART I.-IMPERIAL REPORT. B.97 PART I.98 to Bombay where I purchased 11 Arab horses, 17 ponies and galloways and 3 donkeys. From Bombay I went to Bangalore and proceeded to Hosur with the Hon'ble General Sir Henry Brackenbury and Colonel Deane; at Hosur I in- spected the pony mares and stallions of the Salem district and proceeded to Tirrupur and Erode in the Coimbatore district for the same purpose. I then proceeded to Madras where I had an interview with the Director of Land Re- cords, at which questions referring to pony and mule breeding, work of Stock Inspectors, &c., were discussed. I also inspected and bought 5 thoroughbred Australian stallions which, with the sanction of the Government of India, had been imported. In December, I visited Hyderabad and conferred with the Resident and Prime Minister on questions relating to horse breeding in that State; I also visited the Stud Farm of Rajanpett; from there I proceeded to Mysore with a view of advising the authorities on the subject of pony breeding operations. I also inspected the country bred remounts bred at the Stud Farm of Kunegal. From thence I proceeded to Bombay where I continued my purchases of Arab horses, and purchased 18 donkeys. From Bombay I proceeded to Calcutta to confer on various subjects with the Secretary to the Government of India, Revenue and Agricultural Department, and to act as Judge in the country bred classes of the Tollygunge Horse Show. I then proceeded north and visited the State of Patiala. In January, I proceeded to Babugarh with General Sir J. Watson who had been deputed from England; here a large number of stallions had been collected for Sir J. Watson's inspection. I then accompanied Sir J. Watson to the Shikarpur Fair with a view of showing him the mares and young stock of Sindh, and on proceeding to Jellalabad Horse Show, where Sir John saw the mares and young stock of that part of the Punjab, I halted at the Native States of Bahawalpore and Faridkot in order to show him the endeavours that were being made to extend horse breeding in Native States. From there I proceeded to Bombay to com- plete the purchases of Arabs. In February, I proceeded from Bombay via Kurrachee, to attend the Sibi Horse Show where I again met Sir J. Watson, and showed him the mares and young stock of Baluchistan; thence we proceeded together to attend the Horse Show at Bulandshahr where Sir John was enabled to see the mares and young stock of the North-Western Provinces. From Bulandshahr I made an exhaustive inspection of the depôt Farm, deciding on the Farm operations for the ensuing year; from thence I proceeded to Dera Ismail Khan where I attended the Horse Show. In March, I attended the Horse Shows held at Bahawalpore, Jhang, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Shahpur, Umballa and Lahore. 464. This would complete my tour for the official year, but as the tour extended to 3rd May, it is thought more convenient to complete it in this summary than to postpone it to next official year. In April, I proceeded to Rawalpindi where I attended the Horse Fair and had interviews with the Deputy Commissioner, the Commissioner, and the Major General Commanding, with reference to the proposed new stallion Depôt, also with the Executive Engineer, Military Works, on the question of the water-supply. I also conferred with the Deputy Adjutant General, Bengal Army on the question of the selection of Officers to form the Judging Com- mittees at Horse Shows. I then proceeded to Meerut where I visited the Demonstration Farm; thence to Cawnpore where I visited the Experimental Farm; from there I proceeded to Muktesar where I made a careful inspection of the Bacteriological Laboratory; thence I proceeded to Naini Tal and had an interview with the Lieutenant-Governor on the question of the building of the Laboratory. On my return, I inspected the Dak line from Naini Tal to Kathgodam to ascertain the causes which have led to "Surra" being so pre- valent on this line; from there, I proceeded to Depôt to allot the new horses to the various provinces. I then inspected the Dak line from Saharanpore to
99 Rajpore, on which much correspondence has taken place owing to the pre- valence of both Glanders and Surra. I had an interview with the Superintendent of the Dun and hope that my representations will be the means of protecting Government animals on that road; from there I returned to Simla. In all, I visited 19 Horse Shows held in various parts of India, travelled 19,203 miles by rail, 1,214 miles by road, and 500 by sea. 465.

It will be seen that the changes which have taken place are the reversions of Veterinary Lieutenant Cranford and Veterinary Captain Short, and the transfer of Veterinary Lieutenant Larnder from the post of Assistant Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, to the Superintendentship, South Punjab, vice Cranford reverted. The appointment of Veterinary Lieutenant Baldrey as Assistant Principal of the Bombay Veterinary College, vice Larnder. Also the appointment of Veterinary Lieutenant Trydell, vice Short reverted. The post of 2nd Furlough Officer which was vacant on 1st April was filled up by
101 the appointment of Veterinary Lieutenant Clarke, who is officiating for Veteri- nary Lieutenant Harris at home on medical certificate. The constant changes taking place in this Department must prove in- jurious to its interests. During the year under review, the rules for the Civil Veterinary Department received the sanction of the Secretary of State, and were issued on 28th June 1895. All officers were given six months to decide whether they would join the Department permanently. At the expira- tion of that period, I regret to say, that the following resignations were received:102 As Sir John Watson's time in this country was limited, a show in each horse breeding Province was selected, and by the above it will be seen that he was able to see a large collection of brood mares and young stock at each. In addition to this, he was able to visit the States of Bahawalpore, Faridkot, and Ulwar, to see the different systems adopted for the improvement of horse stock. I accompanied him in his inspection of the country bred remounts of the 18th Hussars stationed at Umballa, and he was also able to see those of the 5th Lancers at Muttra, accompanied by the Director of the Army Remount Department. I was pleased to have this opportunity of discussing the question of the supply of stallions suitable for this country with this officer, and at the same time of pointing out to him the faults so commonly seen in the country bred mare and which I am so anxious to avoid in the stallions sent out. GENERAL REMARKS. Horse breeding in Ajmere Merwara. 469. Two stallions were employed in Ajmere-Merwara during the year under report; one was stationed at Ajmere the other at Kekri, having been removed from Deoli where he stood for some time without success. The transfer of this horse to Kekri took place on 2nd November 1895, and the result has been disappointing, as, during the five months that have elapsed since the horse arrived at Kekri, only 11 mares have been served by him. The total number of mares covered by both horses was 54, being an average of 27 per horse as against 12 last year. On this point the Principal, Ajmere Veterinary School, who is in charge of horse breeding in Ajmere- Merwara, states! "Of this number 35 came to 'Purwana' and only 19 went to 'Seoni'. This number, though far below that required by regulations, is an increase on last year's coverings and should I think, be considered encour- aging. As before stated, I have not visited the districts in which 'Seoni' has been stationed, so therefore cannot offer any reasons why his services have not been in greater demand, but, the Deputy Magistrate at Kekri, in reply to my official enquiries, states that the small number of coverings at Kekri may, in his opinion, be attributed to the fact that the transfer was not widely known in the District, and thinks that when the horse's presence at Kekri becomes more generally known, his services will be in greater request. Under these circum- stances, I would recommend that the horse be allowed to remain for another year. "The number of mares brought to 'Purwana' shows that his popularity amongst owners of mares has increased since last year, and if his young stock should prove to be satisfactory, his services will, it is hoped, be in greater request during this and future years." "The pony stallion belonging to the Beawar Municipality has, I am informed by the Assistant Commis- sioner of that place, covered 13 mares daring the year. With reference to the class of mare brought to the stallion at Ajmere, Veterinary Captain Hagger is of opinion that the number of mares suitable for breeding purposes should be sufficient to require the services of two stallions. Branding of mares. On this subject, Veterinary Captain Hagger states :103 visit villages, see the mares, and explain the meaning of the brand, and if possible convince owners that it would be more to their advantage to breed a better class of young stock by a Government sire for which a ready market at a good price is obtainable, than to produce inferior animals by a common horse" A portion of these difficulties have been overcome. A sum of money sufficient to cover Veterinary Captain Hagger's expenses whilst touring in Ajmere-Merwara, has been sanctioned by the Government of India for 1896-97. This will enable this officer to tour through that part; and proposals, with reference to this important measure, have been submitted for the consideration of the Agent to the Governor-General. I would not feel justified to recommend the appointment of a Zilladar or any other establishment, considering that there are only two horses employed and that even these do but very moderate work; later on, when horse breeding improves, it will be for consideration whether one Zilladar should not be appointed. Horse breeding in Central India. 470. Horse breeding in Central India must be looked upon as very unsatis- factory. Six stallions have been employed during the year and have covered only 118 mares. Feeling that the falling off in the number of coverings could not be allowed to continue, as we could not possibly afford to keep these stallions in comparative idleness, I addressed the Commandant, Central India Horse, asking him whether there was any chance of an improvement taking place or whether he would recommend a reduction in the number of stallions employed. He consulted the Officers Commanding, 1st and 2nd Regiments, Central India Horse, in whose charge the horses are; the former officer states that in his opinion it would be undesirable to withdraw the three stallions employed in the district, adding that the Political Agent had distributed notices throughout the District urging proprietors to send in their mares more fre- quently and that he anticipated favourable results therefrom. The latter officer asks that the question of a reduction in the number of stallions should be deferred for another year, when there will be more reliable data for arriving at a decision on the subject. For the above reasons, I would not consider it advisable to interfere with present arrangements, until March 1897; but if then, no improvement takes place, the question of the advisability of removing all or a portion of the number of stallions employed, will have to be considered. Horse and mule breeding beyond the border. Kur- rum. 471. During the year, at the request of Mr. Merk, Commissioner and Superintendent, Peshawar Division, a donkey was supplied for the Kurrum Valley and is placed in the charge of the officer on special duty, who reports as follows:104 Cleansing of Railway Horse- Boxes and Cattle- Trucks. 473. A most important discussion has taken place during the year under review, which has resulted in definite orders being issued on the subject of the cleansing of horse-boxes and cattle-trucks. It was felt that, in view of the importance of the subject, somewhat more stringent measures should be adopted than those that were generally in force. The Governor General in Council was pleased to promulgate the following rules for adoption on State Railways worked by Government, and desired that in order to secure the object in view, the administrations of other Railways might be moved to also adopt them:105 The following is a Synopsis of the Manual :106 maintained by annual visits, but this I hope, during my tenure of office, to be able to carry out. As I did last year, I purpose giving a short outline of the work done during the year. I shall take each State in the order in which I visited it. PUNJAB STATES. Bahawalpore. 477. The interest shown in this State has been fully maintained. I visited Bahawalpore in October and mainly confined my attention to the State Stud at Lorha. My visit to this stud proved to me more conclusively than ever that these studa can seldom be a success. I carefully inspected every animal, including :107 The State awarded Rs. 1,656 in prizes and the Government of India presented a silver medal for competition. This medal was awarded to an owner who exhibited108 At the home stud are kept 5 horse stallions, 5 pony, and 2 donkey stallions; amongst these are included some of the best English and Australian thorough-bred blood; also very high caste Arabs, including the well known racing pony "Blitz." The number of mares employed is as follows :109 484. Mule breeding. This industry is sufficiently popular in the State to warrant me in thinking that if more donkeys were employed great progress might be made. Up to the date of my visit (January 1896) 26 zemindari mares had been brought to the home stud to be covered by the donkey. At present there are available:110 work that the Council of Regency decided to purchase another Arab Galloway for the purpose of covering the smaller mares, as is done by District Board stallions in other parts of India. Mule breeding. Religious prejudice is still a little strong against this industry, and although two donkeys were sent to Jhind and Chakri Dadri, but few mares have been covered by them. A start has, however, been made at Head Quarters, viz111 WESTERN STATES OF RAJPUTANA. Ulwar. 492. This State ranks before all others in its endeavours to extend horse breeding. I shall first speak of the Home Stud which is one of the few that is doing good work. In this Stud are to be found as fine mares as can be seen in any part of India. Of these, 82 were in foal when I visited the State; this is one of the highest percentages of successful coverings which I have ever heard of in India. During the year under review, a great num- ber of inferior mares were eliminated from the Stud and were either relegated to mule breeding or were sold. Twenty-three good serviceable mares were added to the Stud. Twenty-four good stallions are employed, including Thoroughbred English, Australians, Norfolk Trotters and Arabs, besides two selected Kathiawars. During the year, these horses covered 569 mares against 137 in the preceding year; these including zemindari mares as well as those of the Stud. Sixty-two horse foals and three mule foals were dropped in the Stud during the year. I shall not reiterate what was said last year with reference to the runs; they leave but little to be desired. In the runs were 81 colts, 121 fillies, and six mules, in addition to 25 foals that were with the mares, being unweaned. During the year under review, eight new stallions have been added, including one of the best Thoroughbred English stallions,"Wicklow Spar." This horse is one of the last importations and was sold to the State with the sanction of the Government of India. 493. The Political Agent, Major Pears, to whose zeal must be attributed the success gained at Ulwar, was very anxious that a horse show should be held in the State with a view of encouraging the zemindars. It was held from 26th September to 5th October 1895, and must be considered to have been most successful. The following is a list of the animals that were present:112 This show must be looked upon as having been highly successful from a Native Cavalry point of view, especially as the remounts obtained were excel- lent. The 1st Bengal Cavalry Officer, states :113 This officer reports as follows :114 be bought from the zemindars, should be reared in this Depôt. Already this suggestion is being acted on and Colonel Loch informs me that he hopes to get between 300 and 400 mares fit to breed from. It will be seen that this can all be done without increasing expenditure in the State, in fact by reducing the number of stallions, as has been done, the expenditure is lessened; it is in this direction, as I have before said, that by acting as professional adviser to these States, that I hope to make horse and mule breeding a success. Bhopal and Gwalior. 499. During the year under review, enquiries were made, through the Political Agent of Bhopal and the Resident at Gwalior, as to whether anything was done in the way of horse breeding in either of these States and whether I could help them in any way. Both States replied that nothing was done in this direction, but they both accompanied this information by a cordial invita- tion to me to visit their respective States. As, however, I felt that but little advantage could be gained, and as my time was so fully occupied, I did not visit them. From Remount Rolls, however, received from the Inspector General, Imperial Service Troops, I find that the Inspecting Officer, Central India States Cavalry, bought 16 remounts at a fair held at Gwalior, and makes the following remarks:115 These 7 stallions should be carefully inspected and any that possess the faults that should be guarded against, as before mentioned, should be got rid of. If the State officials would like me to do so, I would inspect them when in Mysore. Ponies to replace any of these could be purchased in Bombay at an average of Rs. 400 to Rs. 450. We now come to the district of Mysore itself, where it is believed the best mares are obtainable. To commence with, 2 stallions should be bought for breeding in this district; these should be the best that money can buy. I would put down their cost at about Rs. 800 each. The number is fixed at 2, as that is the number for which employment is found, but as the industry recommends itself to the ryots and as they begin to see the advantages, and further, as castration is extended in the district and the number of village Tats diminishes, it will be necessary to add to the number of stallions employed. These two stallions should be placed in two of the best centres in the dis- trict in charge of district officials, who should be asked when on tour to preach to the people and to point out the advantages to be derived; by their personal influence they should ensure at least 60 mares being covered annually by each stallion. They should, when on tour, cause mares to be collected at different centres; should select the best of those collected; they should then get the owners to promise that when these mares come in season they will take them to the stal- lion to be covered. Mares so selected should be supplied with a certificate on the form marked A. Certificated mares to have priority of claim to the services of the stallions. A register should be kept of all mares covered. At the time of: covering, the owner of the mare should be supplied with a Covering Certificate. The Veterinary Assistant would obtain a list of mares covered during the year previously and should ascertain the result, giving the owner of any foal born a Produce Certificate. The Veterinary Assistant,in addition to performing this duty, should actively carry out castration commencing with the worst village Tats that can be found He should be obliged to castrate all village Tats free, and should be compelled to send a monthly diary to the Officer in charge of Pony Breeding Operations. This diary should show the villages visited and the work done, and should have the signature or seal of the headman of each village which he visits. To enlist his sympathy in the work, he might be promised some reward for all colts cas- trated over 150 annually. The posting of stallions at certain centres is advocated rather than sending them on tour, as the latter system has been frequently tried and found to fail. No doubt a certain number of mares are covered when a stallion is taken on tour, but great disappointment arises when breeders bring their mares to a stand and find that the stallion is not present. Breeders should be encouraged to keep their fillies, the produce of State stallions, for breeding purposes. When operations have been in existence for two or three years, it might be advisable to hold a Pony Show in Mysore, somewhat on the lines of those held in Salem and Coimbatore districts in the Madras Presidency. The Veterinary Assistant who is proposed for service in the Pony-Breeding Department might be sent to the Babugarh Depôt near Meerut for two or three months to be trained; there he would be taught the management of stallions and mares at the time of covering, &c., &c. By the kindness of Colonel Macintyre, I was able to inspect the country- bred horses of the Imperial Service Lancers which had been bred at the Kune- gal Stud. Many were useful horses but I feel certain I shall be pardoned if I express an adverse opinion on many that I saw; the fault I would find with them is that they are too light and although Colonel Macintyre has a great opinion of their powers of endurance, still they are not what I would describe good troop horses likely to do well on service.
116 DECCAN. Hyderabad. 501. During the summer months, Nawab Vicar-ul-Umra Bahadur, Prime Minister of the Hyderabad State, visited Simla, and I had the pleasure of an interview with him. During the conversation, which turned mainly on horse- breeding questions, in which he was greatly interested, he expressed a wish to see, if possible, what was being done in Northern India; I therefore had the pleasure of accompanying him and his suite to Babugarh, where I was able to show him a very great number of Thoroughbred English, Arab, and other stal- lions. Captain Westlake, the Superintendent of the Remount Depôt, kindly showed him all the young stock; he was much impressed with all he saw and asked me, if possible, to visit Hyderabad to confer with him on horse-breeding matters; this I did in December last, when I was able, after careful considera- tion, to bring to his notice the following facts. His Highness the Nizam's Government maintains about 60 stallions which are distributed in various districts, and also expends a large sum annually with a view of fostering horse-breeding in the State, but as far as can be ascertained, but little advantage is derived from the expenditure incurred. I had the opportunity of conferring with Mr. Ali Abdullah and other State officials, and the general opinion expressed was that few if any, good mares are maintained, or that if they are, they are not brought for service by the Government stallions; most of the Authorities differed as to the cause, some being of opinion that the mares never did exist, whilst others were of opinion that the mares are still to be found, but owing to the size of His High- ness' Dominion, it is impossible for one man to visit each district and to work it properly, which must be done, if horse breeding is to be sucessful. 502. By the report on Horse-Breeding Operations in His Highness the Nizam's Dominion of 1883 to which are attached notes by the Director, Army Remount Department, Brigadier General Sir C. Gough, and others, good mares must have existed, we find that the numbers attending the Malegaon Fair were increasing yearly, and that from 1878 to 1882. the numbers rose from 1,057 to 3,871, and the Superintendent then stated that he saw no reason why the num- bers should not increase to 25,000; and he further stated that 500 horses would be available for the British Government if required. The result of the Fair of 1894 was most disappointing, instead of the numbers having increased, they fell from nearly 4,000 to under 1,000, and instead of a great number being available for Military purposes, the Remount Agent, Ahmednagar, was only able to obtain 10, and half these came from British territory. To remedy this, the State has sanctioned the importation of about 200 Persian mares; this I consider to be only an artificial stimulus, and I further am of opinion that efforts should be directed to improve the indigenous breed of horses. In order to put horse-breeding on a more satisfactory basis, I recom- mended :117 I further suggested that in future none but mares should be purchased for the Irregular Troops of the State, and that they should be covered by the State stallions, and that their produce should be bought up at Rajanpett; this would, I feel certain, be beneficial to the State. KASHMIR. Kashmir. 503. In last year's Administration Report, I stated that I hoped the day was not far distant when not only would an attempt be made to improve the present breed of Kashmiri ponies, which although sturdy and hardy animals are, gen- erally speaking, small, but that also mule-breeding would be introduced into this State. I feel convinced that if only the Kashmiri can be made to see that this is likely to prove a paying enterprise, he will adopt it with alacrity. I am pleased to say that a commencement has really been made and that already two good Arab ponies have been purchased and are actually at work. The object in getting these Arab ponies is to gradually improve the stock and to breed mares that ultimately will throw good Ordnance mules. The services of these stallions are given free; the conditions being that if a filly is dropped it will become the property of the zemindar, if, on the other hand, a colt is dropped it will be taken by the promoters of the scheme. The Government of India, with a view of assisting mule breeding in Kashmir, have sanctioned the temporary loan of 2 donkeys; those selected being an Italian 12-3½ and one Catalonian of 13-1¼. The intention is to give the services of these stallions free to owners of ponies and to purchase from them the produce when weaned, say at 8 months and to run the young stock during the summer months on the high hills in Kashmir, and in the winter months on the lower hills round about Poonch; to effect the latter, it has been arranged to stack hay for them there. One pony and one donkey are stationed at Srinagar, and although the scheme is in its infancy, more country mares are being brought to them than they can serve. One pony and one donkey are stationed in Poonch. When last I heard they had only been there 7 days, it is therefore too early to offer any opinion as to the success which is likely to attend this part of the scheme. The question that now arises is, what class of mule will be produced by the Kashmiri mare, which as I have before said is a small one, when mated with a big donkey; time alone will prove this. The promoter of the scheme writing on this point, says:GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

In the North-Western Provinces and Punjab, the two large employers Produce, of District Board stallions, the following number of foals were dropped, (vide Table D. page lxxxii):124 It, therefore, means that a pony has to be bought in Bombay for about Rs. 275, and ponies of the stamp which should be employed, cannot be purchased for anything like that amount. Pony-breeding, Burma. 514. At the commencement of the year, 5 ponies were borne on the books, but only 4 did any work, as one was destroyed for paralysis in November. One stallion was sold in November, so that only three remained at the end of the year. Altogether 71 pony mares were covered, giving an average of 14.2 mares per stallion employed. The number of foals dropped was 32. Endeavours are being made to sell all the imported stallions and to obtain Shan stallions. This is undoubtedly a move in the right direction. Pony-breeding Madras. 515. Pony-breeding operations cannot be said to be very successful in Burma.

In short, whether the breeding of cattle pays them. (c) The class of cattle, especially cows, found in the different parts of the district whether good or had. If the people keep many cows, what is the height of the majority of them, and are they sturdy, or generally small. (d) What is the general management of the animals. Is grazing in any quantity available, and do the people grow and store suffi- cient fodder for them. (e) Are local breed bulls turned loose in sufficient numbers for the cows; and are the bulls suitable and of good quality. (f) Have any bulls been introduced into the district. If so, what breed are they. Where have they been stationed. Do the people like them. Can any of their stock be seen, and do the people prefer it to their own indigenous breed. Have any of the stock been turned loose as bulls. (g) If the people do not like the bulls, what are the real reasons for their dislike. If the above information be collected, some advance will have been made in the knowledge of the requirements of the various parts of the pro- vince with regard to cattle-breeding. Veterinary Assistants should be directed to thoroughly travel their districts, carefully noting and reporting to the Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, on the abovementioned points, village by village, until the information for the whole of their charge is complete. The Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, will then take steps to have the information thus furnished, duly verified, ledgered, and recorded. Cattle Disease. 526. With regard to the collection of statistics of cattle disease, it is desirable that a good general knowledge of the diseases which do occur, should be ob- tained; otherwise no opinion can be formed as to what is necessary to be done in the matter. Certain diseases are very prevalent in certain parts of a district, and do not occur in others. Other diseases assume a benignant form in certain centres, whilst, they are exceedingly malignant in others. In view, therefore, to obtain a correct record of all diseases which are prevalent in the districts, the work required from Veterinary Assistants will be: (a) To report, at once, to the Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department, serious outbreaks of disease. (b) To state the nature of the disease, and numbers (approximately) of deaths; having ascertained this from the people. (c) To state what treatment or other measures have been applied, and whether the people will allow their cattle to be segregated in outbreaks of contagious disease, or not. (d) In cases of disease, which the Veterinary Assistants cannot cor- rectly diagnose, they should give the symptoms, course, termina- tion, and also post-mortem appearances; and should, if possible, in the case of contagious diseases, collect tissues under direc- tions of the Assistant to the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Department. (e) Veterinary Assistants should take every opportunity, during their tours, to advise the people regarding the treatment of ordinary diseases with common drugs, and tell them what to do in cases of serious disease. These proposals having been accepted by the Government of the Punjab, Veterinary Captain Pease, with the sanction of the Government of India, com- menced his duties in the Gurgaon district in October last and began the Bacteriological Survey in the districts of Dehli, Umballa, Kurnal, and parts of Ludhiana.
133 At first he found that no statistics of any value whatever were maintained, and in these circumstances, especially as the Veterinary Assistants em- ployed knew little regarding the various maladies which existed in the villages of their charge, it became necessary to devise a means of obtaining the neces- sary information. As many villages as possible were visited, but it was of course impossible to visit every one; still every endeavour was made to dis- cover what diseases actually existed and were known to the people. The pro- gress has necessarily been slow, but still a great deal has been done. The Survey has so far been successful in deciding the nature of two of the diseases which cause considerable loss of cattle in certain tracts which have been visited, viz., Jowar poisoning and Fluke disease. 1st134 animal industry at Washington, U. S. A., specimens of this worm for the favor of their opinion on the subject, which will be made known later on. It is the more probable that the worm may correspond with the American variety, as a number of other animal parasites in this country do so. Notably is this the case with a parasite which has been mentioned in the reports as exceedingly common, causing-nodular disease of the intestine in the sheep, viz., Oesopho- gotma Columbianum. Echinococcosis. 530. The prevalence of echinococcosis amongst the cattle of the Punjab has also been prominently brought forward, and points to the fact that a considera- ble number of dogs and probably jackals are affected by the mature tapeworm whose intermediary stage this is, viz., "Taenia echinococcus." Anthrax. 531. With regard to the prevalence of anthrax, much evidence of a negative character has been collected, which points to the fact that this disease is very much less prevalent than it is generally believed to be. There is very little doubt that the majority of cases returned under this heading are certainly not due to the presence of the "Bacillus Anthracis." Errors of diagnosis account for an enormous number of them. It has been found that the most varied diseases are attributed to this malady, such as, surra, fluke, black quarter, malignant sore throat, and in fact any disease which is at all puzzling and in which death occurs. The simple fact that all the cases attributed to this disease where material has been submitted to the Imperial Bacteriologist for opinion, have proved nega- tive, points to this. In the present state of scientific knowledge it is not suffi- cient for a man to state from a microscopic examination of a cadaver, that animals are suffering from anthrax. A microscopical examination is occasion- ally misleading, even in the hands of an experienced man. Proof beyond dispute is easily obtained by bacteriological methods, and we have an Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory presided over by one of the leading European ex- perts. Yet, strange to say, this proof is not often sought. Endeavours have been made to ensure the submission of material suitable for bacteriological examination from animals reported to be suffering from the disease, and orders have been issued by the Director, Army Remount Department, for this to be done so far as the depôts are concerned. It is hoped that the orders of the Government of India in the Military Department will also be issued, so that all reported outbreaks of anthrax amongst army horses may be confirmed by bacteriological examination which cannot but be satisfactory to the Veterinary Surgeons. So far as cattle are concerned, there appears to be absolutely no conclusive evidence of the existence of "Charbon bacteridien" occurring amongst them at present. Steps have been taken to obtain material for exami- nation from reputed cases, and this will, in a short time, be accomplished. Malignant sore throat. 532. Malignant sore throat has been noted in the report and its probable causes mentioned. It appears likely that this disease is similar to "Barbone," a disease which is very common in the buffal135 INFORMATION COLLECTED. 534. PUNJAB.136 The tahsildars will arrange to report outbreaks of epizootics immedi- ately they appear in a village, to the Circle Inspectors. The duties of Stock Inspectors during the prevalence of epizootics are:137 (6) Inspect cattle pounds for sanitation, &c. (7) Whenever tahsildars find difficulty in the correct compilation of out- break reports specially as to the nomenclature of diseases, they should avail themselves of the advice of the Stock Inspectors. (8) Stock Inspectors working in the pony-breeding districts should check and report the results of mares covered on form, which will be supplied to them, and also attend to the Government stallions when required by the officers in charge. (9) Stock Inspectors should submit tri-monthly diaries of their work, to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, through the Collector of the District in which they are working. (10) Stock Inspectors should submit direct to the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, tri-monthly reports of outbreaks com- piled from the village reports on the form and also any special reports called for by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment. (11) Stock Inspectors will receive every possible assistance from the taluk and village officials in the proper discharge of their duties. They will have a taluk peon during their movements in the taluk. (12) If serious outbreak of disease be reported from districts other than the five selected, the Inspectors having no disease in their circles will be deputed to investigate such outbreaks. No reports on the survey work have yet been received. The Superin- tendent has been addressed on the subject and a plan for the collection of information has been sent for adoption. It is little use awaiting the reports of district officers regarding the outbreak of disease, as it is generally not reported to these officials. What is required for the survey is a record of all the serious diseases which exist and are known to the people, their native names, &c., and this can only be obtained by careful enquiry village by village. If my sug- gestions are carried out by the Government of Madras, we shall by next year have a very good knowledge of the diseases affecting cattle and their distribu- tion. 537. NORTH PUNJAB.138 From a description of the disease it appears to have been malignant sore throat. Rinderpest.139 "A correspondence is going on with reference to the appointment of district salutries for this purpose, and if their entertainment is sanctioned I hope to be able to furnish information in future under this head." "Nothing was done with reference to cattle disease investigation and prevention, though lots of cattle were inspected in the Barkhan Kacchi, Nari and Sibi tahsils." Outbreaks dur- ing the year. 543. Table M. (page xcix) gives the details regarding the reported out- breaks of contagious disease in India and Burma. Burma is again the only Province in which any practical results have been obtained. The remarks of the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Departmnet, are given in paragraph 544 to show the distribution of cattle disease. But before alluding to this subject it would be advisable to mention that Burma is to be congratulated on the very great advance which has been made in the introduction of the Upper and Lower Burma Village Act, measures for the pre- vention of disease have been put into force in those districts or parts of districts in which their introduction was considered advisable. In Financial Commis- sioners Circular No. 19 of 1895 it is stated that every officer in Burma is alive to the great importance of the measures now being taken and the Financial Commissioner trusts that full and immediate effect may be given to them. The following are the rules for the working of the abovementioned Act:140 X.141 The heaviest mortality was reported from the Kaladan township. The disease as above noted broke out at the beginning of the year and by the end of July it had committed fearful ravages. ID April no deaths were shown in the returns; however, in May there were 1,612, and in June the greatest mortality for any township was recorded, namely, 5,670. In July there were 2,290 deaths, but during August there was some abatement; however, it did not show marked indications of dying out till November, after which mouth only a few deaths were reported. The disease appeared in the Minbya township soon after the outbreak in the Kaladan; it was carried there by some buffaloes which were purchased in the infected area, and continued to give trouble till November. During August and October many animals succumbed, name- ly, 1,811 in the former and 1,123 in the latter month. The Myoboung townships, like the Kaladan, was the scene of severe outbreaks of cattle plague, which commenced in June, during which month 198 deaths were reported, and between August and October 8,573 were regis- tered. From November the disease gradually subsided and at the close of the year only 30 deaths were reported. In Urrittaung, disease did not break out amongst the cattle till June, and in July and August it did little harm, but assumed a more severe form in September. The mortality then ran high and between October and January the deaths registered amounted to 3,908. This is the only township where the disease was prevalent in a severe form at the close of the year. In the remaining townships, namely, Akyab, Rathedaung, Pauktaw, and Naaf, the disease did much damage, disappearing in one township only to appear with increased viru- lency in another. The Naaf township was the least affected, and is the only one in which the mortality from rinderpest was below a thousand. Anthrax and charbon symptomatique.142 Anthrax and Charbon symptomatique.143 Anthrax and Charbon symptomatique.144 72. In this month there was also an outbreak in the Ngapin circle and between September and March 227 deaths were reported. At the close of the year (March) the disease was reported to be still prevalent in the Mogaung, Sindók, and Nyaungbinzeik circles of the same township, and in the Saing, Mindé, and Ngahlaingón circles of the Thayetmyo township. The total loss from all these circles in this month is 326. Anthrax and charbon symptomatique.145 Rinderpest.146 occurred in the Gujrat District during the year. In a letter No. 63, dated 25th February 1896, from the Deputy Commissioner, to the Commissioner and Superintendent, it is stated:147 to find. The disease, on the other hand, exists to a very great extent in the Hissar and Rohtak districts which are dry and arid. I had an opportunity of seeing an outbreak of black quarter at the Hissar cattle farm where it is very common, and also had an outbreak of if at the Jahazgarh cattle fair in the autumn. It is the same disease as is found in England and behaves in exact- ly the same way as regards its symptoms and course. 549. In most of the districts visited, the most serious disease reported, with the exception of rinderpest, was found to be that which is known to us as malig- nant sore throat, which is looked upon by the natives as the most serious of all diseases of cattle. It generally makes its appea ance in the rains, in the month of Bhadon especially. I find, taking fifty villages visited dur- ing my tour, that 28 of them were invaded by this disorder last year. So far as I am able to ascertain this is essentially a disease of the buffaloe and chiefly attacks young animals up to the age of two or three years. In by far the greater majority of the villages examined, the people say that the disease only attacks young buffaloes. In others they say that young calves are also affected, and in others again, that animals of all kinds and all ages are attacked. In some villages it is generally believed by the people that the disease only attacked young buffaloes a few years ago, but that now it attacks bullocks and calves also. This may be the case, or it may be that similar diseases are confounded one with another, which is by no means unlikely. The disease I am alluding to is very sudden in its appearance, attacking an animal apparently in good health and condition and running its course with alarming rapidity, the animal perishing in a few hours. It appears sud- denly in a village and disappears as suddenly after attacking animals in great or less numbers for from three to five days, so that it is extremely difficult to catch cases excepting by accident, as the disease is over before one gets inform- ation of its appearance and gets to the scene of the outbreak. It is extremely uncertain in the number of deaths it causes, but the death rate per thousand is often very high indeed. The following, taken haphazard, from a number of villages shows the number of deaths to the number of buffaloe calves present:148 dei bufali). It appears that it is very common in the neighbourhood of Salerno, Rome, and Terrade-Lavare. It was first described by Metaxa, more recently it has been likened to anthrax It is observed in the summer and appears commonly in young buffaloes. It begins with high fever 105 to 107 F. Among its principal symptoms there is swelling of the throat, flow of saliva, inflammation of the buccal membrane and tongue and intense dys- pnoea. Swellings may appear on other parts of the neck, shoulders, &c. They are 149 "Climatic disturbances such as want of rain, excess of humidity or damp, cloudy weather, and extreme and unnaturally high temperature are said to cause jowar to become poisonous. It is remarked in the Dictionary that it will be observed from the foregoing remarks already offered as to whether due to the presence of an insect or to some physiological change in the growth of the plant, owing to climatic disturbances the jowar stems are not always liable to cause injury to cattle. The occurrence of the poisonous property (as it had been called) is simultaneous over a large tract of country, appearing and disappearing within certain fixed limits of time. The inference is therefore unavoidable that the stems have been affected or altered in some way." Jowar is mostly grown on highlands as a kharif crop, and is only very oc- casionally irrigated. It is dependant on the rains for its moisture. A de- lay of the rain, or an unusually high temperature which withers up and stunts the jowar, is necessary for the production of the change in properties which causes it to become poisonous. During my tour of last year, I found mentioned in every part of the Punjab which I visited that this was a very fatal malady, the nature of which I could not ascertain, as it was not possible to see cases of it, the year not been a suitable one. Owing to failure of the rains and the prevalence of high tem- perature this year, however, I have been able to see animals which have succumbed to the disease, as well as those the subjects to it. Certain points regarding the matter struck me. It appeared that the plant only gave rise to the poisonous symptoms when it had been stunted and withered up to some extent owing to the failure of rain when it had grown to a certain height; this did away with the tympanites theory, for the plant would not in these conditions be in a state in which it is so likely to undergo fermentation as when it contained more moisture. Another point noticed was the rapidity with which the symptoms developed and led to a fatal termination, death being almost apoplectiform in some cases and the majority of the animals attacked dying very rapidly, too rapidly for tym- panites. The people also told me that a crop of the plant which had become stunted and poisonous, lost its poisonous properties if heavy rain fell. Tak- ing all these points into consideration and looking to the symptoms shown by the affected animals, I came to the conclusion that death might be ascrib- ed to the action of an irritant poison causing acute gastro enteritis and causing marked alteration in the blood. What this poison might be how- ever, was a difficult problem to solve, as 1 was led off the line by thinking it was probably either an alkaloid or a poisonous mould. On inspection of the dried jowar which had been given to the animals dead, I was much surprised, on breaking open the stalks to find a very considerable quantity of a white salt deposited in crystals in the pith, more especially at the nodes. The taste of the salt was cooling and saline, very like Nitrate of Potash. On burning the piece of the stalk there was marked crepitation. I collected some of the stalks and a chemical examination revealed the fact that the salt was indeed Nitrate of Potash. The quantity of this salt present in the stems was so considerable, 25 %, that there was no doubt in my mind that this was the cause of the deaths of the cattle which had been fed on it. At the last Sirsa Fair a number of deaths were caused by poisonous jowar and Veterinary Assistant Hakikat Rai, to whom I had mentioned the fact of animals being killed by the development of Nitrate of Potash in jowar stems, found that the jowar was in the same condition as that which I had previously examined. A small bundle of the plant was sent to me for opinion, and this I have had carefully analysed by an analytical chemist in Bombay who reports as follows:150 buted throughout the grass being most abundant in the stem at the nodes or junction of the leaves. The grass contains no other salt in appreciable quantity (Sd.) THOMAS STEPHENSON, F.C.S., 23rd April 1896. Analytical Chemist. Judging from these observations I have no doubt in my mind that the jowar plant at times, in certain circumstances, such as have been mentioned above, becomes distinctly poisonous owing to the amount of Nitrate of Potash which is contained in the stem. In order to test poisonous properties of Nitrate of Potash a heifer was given 10 ounces of the drug in a drench. In ten minutes she commenced to urinate and she was dead in 20 minutes with symptoms of gastro enteritis, tympanites, nausea and colic, staggering gait stupefaction polyuria and death. Some times death from Nitrate of Potash poisoning is apoplecti- form and we may at times observe spasms and rotation of the eyeballs. It is generally very rapid, the animal may succumb in a few minutes. Usually the disease lasts from half-an-hour but seldom over 12 hours. The post-mortem appearances are hæmorrhagic gastro enteritis, cherry red or purple coloration of the gastric mucous membrane and the small intestine and superficial ulceration of this membrane, the intestinal contents are reddish brown. The kidneys are ecchymosed and inflamed. The blood is vermillion in color. The intensity in the effects of this drug is in inverse ratio to the fulness of the stomach. There can be no reasonable doubt that in the cases of poisoning from this disease the cause is the presence of large quantities of Nitrate of Potash in the stems. Some of the samples examined contained 25 per cent. of the salt so that a very small feed of them would introduce sufficient to carry off the animal which ate them. It is therefore necessary to avoid jowar in this condition for if animals are starving and it is available, there seems every possibility that if it were cut up and well washed the nitre would be to a great extent removed and the plant harmless. Distomatosis. Fluke disease in cattle and buffaloes. 553. This disease has been found to be very common in lowlying tracts sub- ject to water logging and inundation and proves very fatal to cattle especially buffaloes. It occurs in most of the villages lying low along the river Jamna and in most villages which are waterlogged and swampy. Thus it is found to be very common in the Kurnal district, in the "bet"of Ludhiana in the village along the sides of the Budha Nala. In the latter situation it is so common that the people have learnt from experience that it is advisable to avoid graz- ing their cattle there at certain times of the year owing to the great numbers which become attacked by and die from fluke disease. I was informed in Ludhiana that if cattle are grazed along the Budha Nala in "Chait" or March they are pretty certain to be attacked by this parasite and to die after varying periods of time. The disease is also common in the villages along the khadir of the Jamna in the Delhi and Gurgaon districts. Name.151 The fluke worm goes through a very complicated life cycle arriving at maturity after numerous changes or stages of development, which although well-known may be very briefly noticed here. The researches of Thomas and Leuckhart have pretty well cleared up the life history of the fluke. The eggs provided with an operculum are expelled with the faeces; within 4 to 6 weeks, an embryo is hatched, and this has a ciliated skin which is provided with a sting at one end. This embryo penetrates into the respiratory tract of some molluscs, and chiefly into the Lymnæa peregra, and L. truncatula and it appears to be probable into some other in this country as L. truncatula does not appear to be very common, here. After a period varying from three to six weeks the embryo is transformed into a "sporocyst" provided with germinative cells which are developed in order to form Redia, these latter in undergoing a new change give birth directly according to Leuckhart, indirectly according to Thomas to the "cercaria" small microscopic beings provided with a tail, which live at liberty in the water. A single distoma egg gives birth to nearly a thousand cercaria. Leuckhart states that the animals ingest the cercaria either by swallowing the Lymnæa with the food, or by drinking water in which they are suspend- ed. Thomas has demonstrated the fact very clearly that the cercaria leave their host's body in order to swim in the water and fix themselves upon aquatic plants or damp meadow grass. They lose the tail and become ball shaped and surrounded by a clammy mass, so that they become cyst like having a diameter of two or three millimetres and they are of snowy whiteness: They preserve their vitality for several weeks. Animals ingest them by browsing the grass to which they are adhering. It is perhaps unnecessary to discuss the subject of how the flukes arrive at the liver in this disease. Most of the worms when they have invaded the liver remain in the biliary canals, but some penetrate the walls of these canals and enter into the liver substance which they destroy and furrow, they pass through Glissons capsule as well as the serious membrane which covers it and may produce perihepatitis or a peritonitis, others penetrate into the branches of the portal system, others finally enter the central hepatis veins and thence pass to distant parts of the body. After passing through the right side of the heart the parasites reach the lung, where they produce haemorrhagic centres and also make caverns with bloody contents. This is especially the case with cattle in which cysts and tubercules are found which are of the size of a hen's egg at times, with thick walls which are calcified at times and contain the parasite swimming in a brownish viscous fluid. Morot has found these para- sites in the slaughter-houses of Troyes in 4 per cent. of the cattle slaughtered, and they are very common in this country. The main post-mortem changes are found in the liver, they dffer mainly ac- cording to the period at which they are observed. In most cases the left lobe is first affected. The liver is enlarged, its weight may be doubled, its edges are rounded and it is changed in color, upon a yellow, gray, or dirty brownish ground we observe dark red or dark reddish brown spots which are round, linear or bran- ched. The surface of the liver presents a coarse appearance, is irregular, and there is sometimes perihepatitis. We frequently observe pin head or millet sized openings in the capsule through which a bloody dirty material oozes. When an incision is made on the surface young flukes may be found immediately under the capsule. On section we see changes in the biliary canals and liver substance; there are many lacunar chambered spaces of a very irregular form and full of bloody reddish brown material and fluke worms in an imperfectly developed state. The biliary canals have ordinarily trebled or quadrupled in size, in cattle they reach the diameter of one's thumb which gives the liver a cystic appearance. In the dilated biliary canals we find fluke worms and their eggs in great quantities. The mucous membrane of the canals owing to the irritation produced by the rough skins of the worms becomes the seat of a purulent catarrh, is considerably thickened and sometimes incrustated with phosphate of lime. In the branches of the portal system we may find thrombosis produced by fluke worms floating free within the blood vessels. The gall bladder
152 contains dirty blackish colored bile and considerable quantities of fluke worms and their eggs. At a more advanced stage we generally find ascites, with isolated fluke worms in the peritoneal cavity. The carcases are much emaciated, the fact has entirely disappeared, the muscles are pale and flabby, the blood thin and watery, and the connective tissue infiltrated with oedema. Symptoms.153 This vesicle is enclosed in a cyst which belongs directly to the host and is formed of connective tissue, muscular fibre and blood vessels, its dimensions vary from that of a pea to that of a man's head, it is filled with a serous liquid which is transparent and does not contain albumen. The scolices of young tapeworms are formed from the proligerous of vesicles originating from the germinal membrane. Each vesicle may contain as many as 1,000. The liver attacked becomes enlarged, its volume may increase 5 or even 10 fold. It presents an irregular surface, the salient parts of which cor- respond with the echinococcus. More than 1,000 have been found in a single liver. Perroncito found a liver weighing 158 lbs. the normal being about 10. The serous membrane which covers the organ is often thickened and may be adherent to the neighbouring organs. On section the liver is found to contain a number of caverns between which the parenchyma remains in the shape of islands. When the echinococei die their contents are transformed into a yellow fatty pasty material which sometimes seems to be composed exclusively of lime; pus may be found in it. In the lungs the echinococci are of a size varying from that of a pea to that of a man's fist; the surface of lobes is uneven. When the hydatids die the cysts become filled with a detritus which gives them a caseous tuberculous aspect. In most cases when the heart is invaded there is but one vesicle which is generally found at the inferior extremity of the median septum near the apex. In the bones mainly at the lower maxilla the echinococcus sometimes produces tumors, they have been found also in the femur and tibia. Symptoms.154 will lead to information from many other parts of India of its occurrence and it will be found to be very wide spread in this country. The adult worms live in the large intestines of the sheep below the caecum; the embryos live in the intestinal walls in tumors which though more abundant in the caecum may be scattered throughout the intestine from the duodenum to the anns. As the disease is little known to Veterinarians and others it is well to reproduce some remarks on the subject of Cooper Curtice:155 There is one point about this disease which I should like to mention and that is that it is not necessary to isolate animals which are suffering from it. We cannot hope to limit its spread by these measures as they are carried out in the districts. The people are put to a lot of unnecessary trouble for no good at present and I think that it would be as well for the masters of the Veterinary Assistants to recognise this fact and spare the Zamindars. The people have several methods of treatment which if they are adopted are very successful and it scarcely seems necessary to interfere with them. The percent- age of deaths is infinitely small. 557. Rinderpest.156 classified. The absence of any information regarding certain diseases notably, pleuro-pneumonia, tuberculosis, verminous bronchitis and the like amongst the cattle of this country is interesting. I doubt whether contagious pleuro-pneu- monia exists at all, as all the reported cases have been undoubted cases of sporadic pleuro-pneumonia. Tuberculosis doubtless exists but is not diagnosed and we hear but little of it for the reason that our slaughter-houses are not properly supervised and animals which may be the subjects of it escape detec- tion. PUNJAB. Veterinary dis- pensaries. 558. Amritsar dispensary.157 from the Lahore school has been employed by the Darjeeling Municipality, but his duties have been principally itinerating. CENTRAL PROVINCES. Akola dispensary.158 Jalgaon.159 Ahmedabad.160 1895. The total number of cases treated during the year was 2,736 against 2,241 last year. There were 381 in, and 2,355 out-patients of which 1,166 were horses, 28 donkeys, 694 cattle, 179 camels and the remainder sheep, goats and dogs. The Veterinary graduate attended out- breaks of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. He treated animals belonging to the Municipality, Society for the pre- vention of cruelty to animals, the Karachi Police, Zoological Gardens, and examined Remounts (Police) previous to purchase. The work done in this dispensary is very satisfactory indeed and great credit is due to the Veterinary graduate in charge. Cases cured ... ... ... 2,580 161 In Bengal one has been established at Muzuffarpore, and it is decided to open one at Dacca, Baghalpur and Bankipore, and it is expected that these may soon be in working order. In the Central Provinces the Akola dispensary has been reopened. Bombay continues to make excellent progress in this direction. There are now twelve stationary and four itinerating dispensaries working, and 17,554 animals have been treated against 14, 315 last year. New dispensaries are being built at Nasik, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and new ones opened at Dharwar, Nadiad, Karachi. The new dispensary at Nadiad is the gift of Sirdar Bahadur Becheridas Vebaridas Desai and Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit has given Rs. 10,000 towards the new building at Ahmedabad. This Department is much indebted to the liberality of these two gentlemen and the interest they take in the veterinary treatment of animals. Cases treated by Veterinary Assistants. 560. Burma.162 These men have to contend with a very serious drawback in the fact that after they leave the teaching institutions, having obtained their certificates, they are, in the majority of cases, unable to avail themselves of an opportu- nity of gaining practical experience in their work under the supervision of a fully qualified man. This point has been markedly brought to my notice during my experience of Veterinary Assistants for a considerable time. It is generally admitted in the Veterinary profession that a man, in order to become a sound practitioner must serve for a time under a practising Veteri- nary Surgeon, even though he receives a training in our best European colleges, and it appears evident that this is much more the case with the men in this country who receive an elementary education to fit them to become "Assistants to Veterinary Surgeons," which is all the vernacular Veterinary institutions profess to give them. The advantage of practice under supervision has been noted in the case, even, of Military Veterinary Assistants who have, before going into districts, served for a time in the hospitals of their regiments under proper supervision. Doubtless this is a very difficult point to arrange for, in the present state of affairs, owing to the paucity of Veterinary Officers in the Civil Veterinary Department. It is rendered the more difficult owing to the want of system which so often characterises the method of dealing with the men in the districts. 563. At the present time a man with a veterinary certificate may be engaged by a local authority and placed in independent charge of an extensive tract of coun- try, entrusted with the arrangements for dealing with various serious contagious plagues of animals, and with no code of rules or regulations to guide him in his work and subject only to the supervision of the native district officials. Are the men, as a rule, qualified to assume an independent charge of this importance and magnitude ? My own experience is that they are in no way fitted, nor is it pretended by the institutions which turn them out that they are. In nine cases out of ten the men never have an opportunity of seeing a case of such diseases as rinderpest, anthrax, pleuro-pneumonia, tuberculosis, surra, and the theoretical knowledge which they receive at the schools is, in regard to these diseases, of the most elementary description, and I cannot admit that the men should be expected to deal with these maladies in a way which is calculated to ensure good results. The fact of the men being practically solely under the supervision of the dis- trict officials who do not understand these questions, tends to make matters even worse so far as the suppression of plagues is concerned, for they are expected to achieve impossibilities. It is hoped that the scheme for the subordinate veteri- nary establishment of the Civil Veterinary Department will make provision for this point and ensure men being supervised and directed by a fully qualified and experienced Veterinary officer, and by men of superior training and education belonging to the subordinate veterinary establishment, placed over the Veteri- nary Assistants of certain groups of districts. 564. Another serious drawback is the inability of these men to read English books and periodicals, and the lack of any vernacular journal for their use. It may be remembered that during the time I was at the Lahore Veterinary College a vernacular veterinary journal was edited for the use of these men and met with very great appreciation. Unfortunately on my being ordered to Poona to do duty in the Bacteriological laboratory the issue had to be discon- tinued owing to my duties being too heavy to allow of my continuing it. The journal was offered as a going concern, but unfortunately no one could be found to take it up. Hence, as it is at present, the men have no opportunity of keeping themselves up in their work or of improving their knowledge. Doubtless, much has been done by the native teachers at the Lahore College by the issue of text books which I was the first to encourage, but I venture to think that the issue of a good vernacular journal is very desirable in order that more detailed information regarding many important diseases not dealt with in the text books should be made available to them. On my return to Lahore I hope to be in a position to re-edit this journal which will appear quarterly.
PART II.165 PART II.166 Zemindars here, as it does in Harriana. The small amount of waste left for grazing of course militates against the production of cattle in great numbers, still in certain parts of the district, in ordinary years, there is a considerable amount of grazing left. The soil and climate of the higher lying portions of the district are healthy for cattle. This district should certainly be self-supporting as regards cattle, but it is far from being so at present, and considerable numbers of these animals have to be purchased from outside. The reason why sufficient cattle are not pro- duced is that the resources of the district are, at present, not made the most of by the people, and the breed of cattle, despite what has been done by the district authorities in the way of supplying bulls, is quickly deteriorating owing to the want of proper bulls in the village herds. If some systematic action could be taken the production of good cattle would rapidly increase. It must not be forgotten that a number of cows must be kept in every village and these must breed. It would be just as well if, instead of as at present produ- cing yearly worse stock by young immature bull calves, or by bulls undergoing the same process of deterioration as they are themselves, they could have the services of decent bulls and produce stock that would be useful and remunera- tive. The demand for bullocks is yearly becoming greater, and there is yearly a falling off in the breeding operations in every district, whilst the breed is gradually deteriorating, so that this subject must, in the course of a few years, become one of very serious importance. Karnal.167 given rise to quarrels, especially in the mixed villages regarding the bulls being allowed to graze in the cultivated fields. The bulls have been injured, and those persons who would turn loose good bulls are afraid to do so. The practice of turning loose bulls by the Hindus was a most satisfactory one so long as the animals released were of good stamp, and it was undoubtedly a very suitable method of providing herd bulls. Bulls turned loose as calves and allowed to feed in the cultivated fields naturally developed into large strong animals. In past times the cultivated area was comparatively small and the waste being so extensive, the people kept more cattle and depended more on the money realised from the sale of them than they do at present. The addi- tion of a bull or two was then considered to be a benefit, and cattle being cheap a good bull calf could be bought for a few rupees. At the present day the culti- vated area has extended so considerably that grazing grounds of any extent only exist in a few favoured spots, and the bulls are driven to feed almost exclusively in the cultivated fields. The cultivator at the present day natu- rally objects to a number of worthless bulls, which do nothing but harm to the herds grazing on his crops. Bulls suitable for the improvement of the breed of cattle cannot be purchased for a few rupees now a days, but the "banian." naturally seeks the most inexpensive calf he can procure to release, as his res- ponsibility ceases when it is released, and he has to submit to none of the inconveniences which result from the accumulation of these wretched brutes in the villages. This all falls on the cultivator from the damage done to his crops and cows. Hence it is easy to understand that these worthless bulls become injured, especially by those who have no religious sympathies with them. I have found that practically all cultivators, whatever their caste, complain bitterly of these useless bulls, and would be very glad to be rid of them. What the effect of the quarrels arising over these bad bulls, on cattle breeding is may be gathered from what has occurred at Nuh lately. This is a large town with a fair number of good cows in it. It seems that a short time ago there were four bulls here. One of them was injured by a Mahomedan culti- vator and perished after great suffering. The Hindus were alarmed at this and brought a complaint. These bulls being the property of no individual no action could be taken in the matter. The Hindus thereupon sent the other bulls to the Jeypore state, leaving one old bull almost useless for the work at Nuh. The harm done by these useless Brahmini bulls was noted in Kurnal and Delhi also, and especially in the latter district. It has been urged on the authorities that the first step towards the improve- ment of cattle and the encouragement of breeding is the regulation of the supply of good herd bulls in the villages and the prevention of bad bulls being released as "pun" by the Hindus, and it has been suggested that a good bull should be maintained for every 300 cows, that this bull be branded and pro- tected, that no Hindu be allowed to release a calf unless the permission of the local or village authorities be obtained and the calf approved of. It has been urged that the provision of bulls should be regulated by the district authorities At the present time there are no returns and no one in any district knows how many bulls there are, whether sufficient in number or of what quality, and until some effort is made to ascertain this nothing practical can result. It has been suggested that the statistical return of cattle should in future include the number of herd bulls in every village, and that the matter of providing a sufficient number of suitable herd bulls in all villages should invariably be provided for in all future settlement operations. The indigenous bulls in the Kurnal district are very inferior in quality, there is no selection in turning them loose. It is quite hopeless to expect any improvement in the breed from the use of these animals, rather may we expect deterioration. The same is true of Delhi and Amballa.
168 Hissar Farm Bulls. A considerable number of these animals are maintained in the various districts, of the Punjab, and are distributed to selected villages being placed in the charge of zaildars and lambardars. In those parts of the province where the indigenous breed of cattle is poor and where the Brahmini bulls are of poor quality and small, these animals are much appreciated by the villagers, as the calves they get are bigger and heavier than those of their own bulls. In the districts visited during my tour this year, where indige- nous bulls of good stamp are scarce, or where the cattle are very bad, the people appreciated the Hissar bred animal on account of his size. 568. In my report of last year I had to record that in the Harriana tract, visited, it was found that the Hissar bred animal was exceedingly unpopular. The reason for this unpopularity is that the animals are badly bred. I have found during the present year that in many places the people complain of the softness of the stock and their inability to perform the same amount of work as ordinary indigenous animals. These animals, however, are tho only ones which we have at our disposal at present, and there is no arrangement so far by which we can procure better bred animals. I am quite opposed to the policy of the Government in distributing cross bred animals of every degree and variety of cross into districts with the object of improving the breed and my reasons for being opposed to it have been given at considerable length, I am glad to say that the introduction of these mongrel bulls into Harriana has now ceased, and I trust that arrangements may be made to supply good pure bred bulls to all districts at no distant date. It is far better, in those parts where the indigenous cattle are fair, to select the best speci- mens of the indigenous breed and turn them loose in the villages. This has been adopted in Harriana. A great number of Hissar bulls have been inspected during the year, and a detailed report submitted. Many of the bulls were of good quality, but a number were bad and unsuitable for breeding purposes, worn out, lame and the like. Attention has been drawn to certain points with regard to these animals. One point demanding attention is continuity of action. When a bull which has been posted to a village is worn out, or becomes useless from any cause, he should be removed, and another of the same class sent. It is evident that when a bull has been posted for a considerable time to a village and has got a quantity of improved stock, it is very imperative if we wish to make any marked improvement in the cattle to ensure continuity of action by which alone we can hope to secure any appreciable and lasting results from the distribution of Government bulls. It must be borne in mind that the theory of improving a breed is to the effect that when crossing only operates on a fraction of the species for a short time, without continuity with animals of various races, it neither creates a half bred race, nor does it absorb or destroy the original race. We produce isolated individuals but no race. Whatever improvement occurs is impressed on individuals and not on the race which is even thrown back by receiving strange elements, and gives individuals of great diversity of character. Crossing cannot subs- titute a new for an old race unless it is sufficiently persevered in to give fixity to the characters of the new produce. It is very obvious, therefore, that if a bull standing in a village produces a fair quantity of improved stock in the shape of cows, and if no bull of the improving breed be available to continue the breed, the cows will be served by inferior bulls and the stock rapidly degenerate to its primitive condition. The Hissar Farm bulls are, as has been stated, of various and bewildering crosses. It has been pointed out, therefore, that it is absolutely necessary to replace bulls in the villages by others of the same breed or cross breed as the original one sent. I am of opinion generally that good pure bred indigenous bulls are superior to the Hissar Farm breed for the production of draught cattle. The question of tying these animals up has been dealt with, and the gen- eral opinion arrived at is that such a proceeding is not only inadvisable but impracticable. Attempts to get it carried out have done much to make the bulls unpopular, and if it had been persevered with, there is no doubt that the demand for Government bulls would have ceased entirely.
169 The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, remarks:170 (b) That they are not quite so foreign as the Punjab and Rajputana breeds, and will get accustomed to the climate of Oudh sooner. (c) That their progeny is sufficiently good, both for milk and draught purposes. Mr. Hadi submits a plan for the provision and maintenance of breed- ing herds at Balrampur with the view of improving the draught and milking properties of the indigenous cattle. If the Estate does not open a cattle farm, it is suggested to procure a number of bulls of the Khairigarh and Parehar breeds and locate them in the large villages where they would serve the local cows and those brought from neighbouring villages. I am of opinion that both these plans should be adopted, much good is likely to result from the introduction of better bulls into the large villages if the management be fairly good and continuity of action ensured. Central Provinces.171 spread far and wide by the travelling herds, skilled veterinary supervision, and the isolation of animals sick is highly desirable. I visited the Cattle Fairs held during the autumn months at Hissar, Sirsa, Jahazgarh, Bhiwani, Imlota, Jullundur, Amritsar, and the Spring Pair at Ludhiana, detailed reports on which have already been submitted. The Pairs at Jahazgarh, Hissar and Bhiwani were highly successful gatherings andgreat numbers of cattle changed hands, chiefly for districts outside the Punjab. Owing to great scarcity of fodder due to failure of the rains, the people sold off as many of their cattle, especially buffa- loes, as possible. The Spring Pairs were not very successful owing to great scarcity, and the veterinary assistant at Jahazgarh reported that the class of young stock brought in was much below the average, a fact which is considered to be due to the rapid decline of cattle breeding in the district. The losses from scarcity of fodder this year will be badly felt, and if severe, will be a great blow to breeding in the tract, and raise the price of cattle. From a perusal of the reviews on these Harriana Pairs, it will be seen that the tract is one of the chief sources of cattle supply for the north-eastern districts of the North-Wes- tern Provinces, as well as for numerous Punjab districts, in which the supply is below the demand. In order to appreciate this, however, it must be understood that in addition to the sales at fairs, the districts are regularly travelled by dealers who take away great numbers of animals. The importance of fostering cattle breeding in this tract has been brought to the notice of the Government, and it is hoped that every endeavour will be made to do so. Burma. 572. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, remarks:172 Madras. Sivalperi Cattle Fair.173 Alambadi being next in respect to numbers. The cattle were brought in chiefly from the taluks of Tinnevelly, excepting those of Satur and Sivilliputur, many also came in from the Madura district. Prices were average, good draught bullocks fetched Rs. 150 per pair. Some suggestions are made for the improvement of the sanitary arrange- ments of the Fair which it is hoped will be adopted by the officials in charge. The only contagious disease seen at the Fair was foot and mouth disease, of which three cases were seen and promptly isolated and the usual precautionary measures being taken, the disease did not spread. The cattle disease prevention Act was enforced and a hospital pound erected. Gurunaswami Festival Fair.174 Mahadeswaram Sills Cattle Fair.175 The market was not brisk and prices were very low, about 10 per cent. below the average, and this is said to have been due to the fact that some of the traders who usually come in from Palcode and Coimbatore being absent. The whole of the arrangements seem to have been very good, and there were no cases of contagious disease reported from the fair. Bengal. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department in Bengal, reports:176 Soncpore Fair.177 Loharu, Jeypur, Ulwar, and Bikanir. They were chiefly adult and were dis- tributed to the following districts:178 Moro. This Show was held in connection with the Horse Pair in February. There was a considerable falling off in the numbers attending, 147 against 392 last year. The few animals shown were of good quality. Talhar. This Show was held in connection with the Horse Show in February. The total number of animals exhibited was 41 against 32 last year. The zamin- dars appear to take but little interest in the Show. Bhuj. This Show was held in connection with the Horse Show. The total number of animals exhibited was 185 against 24 last year. The falling off is attributed to scarcity of fodder. Native States. Ulwar.PART II.181 PART II.182 These examinations cannot be looked upon as having produced such satis- factory results as usual, for, although the percentage of passes is about the same, still, the marks obtained by each student is lower, showing that the gene- ral standard had fallen off. The Board of Examiners remark on this subject as follows:183 branch of education which has been added to the College, the Principal states:184 (c) That the results of the examinations held this year have proved the candidates to be somewhat inferior to those who have pre- sented themselves on former occasions, especially as regards practical knowledge. (d) That the cause, in all probability, is due to the fact that the classes are too large. (e) That the practice is well maintained and that it is ample to afford clinical instruction to the students. (f) That the formation of a class for nalbunds is likely to prove of infinite value. 588. Whilst adverting to the Lahore Veterinary College, it might be stated that this institution provided 24 veterinary assistants for the Chitral Field Force; this will show its usefulness, but I regret to find that the same fault was found with some of these men as is found by the Superintendents, to mark their career in civil life, viz., that whilst some are lazy and unreliable, many are useless from a practical point of view. From a report on these men, received through the Principal Veterinary Officer in India, I find that 11 of the 24 employed are badly reported on, the majority for want of practical knowledge, or, as is stated with reference to this, by the Inspecting Veterinary Officer:185 It is pleasing to note that the students who have passed have had the opportunity of seeing the different forms of contagious diseases, including glanders, rinderpest and foot and mouth disease, and that they also have had the advantage of seeing several obstetric cases. 591. There were 181 operations performed against 169 last year. All the second-year students were put through a course of operations on the dead subject, and afterwards each performed at least two operations on the living animal under supervision. 592. The distance at which this institution is situated from Calcutta has been one of its greatest draw backs, as the students found it next to impossible to attend, I am therefore pleased to find that the sum of Rs. 25,000 has been sanctioned for the erection of quarters for students; this should add greatly to the popularity of the institution. 593. The Principal concludes his remarks on the working of this institution as follows:186 Class B consisted of 11 students who having passed the first examination in April 1895 returned to study for the second or final test. 597. The examinations were conducted by:187 599. In addition to the veterinary classes, 7 men from Native States have attended a 6 months' course in shoeing and have received instruction in the anatomy and physiology of the horse's foot. The number of horses shod during the year was 460. This is most satisfactory; I need not state the necessity which exists in this country for qualified nalbunds. 600.
