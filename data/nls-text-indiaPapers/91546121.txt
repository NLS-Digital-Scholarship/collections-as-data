RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the Years 1920-21 to 1922-23. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Department of Public Health, No. 2518-23, dated the 24th July 1923. READTRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 to 1922-23. General Review.2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA the people to accept vaccination must have contributed to the result. There was no improved organization of district staffs and if anything, the supervision exercised over the work of the vaccination staff was less perfect in many districts than in the past; yet each year of the triennium under review produced results more favourable than any of the previous years excepting 1919-20. The number of operations (excluding dispensary vaccination) performed in 1920-21 and the two succeeding years was 670,425, 650,140 and 697,829, respectively, against 469,471, 469,574, 549,149, 492,008, 563,020, respectively, in 1914-15 and the four succeeding years, while in 1919-20 the figure was 839,079. The total operations and the successful vaccinations for the triennium were the highest on record as can be seen from the following table:FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. 3 Amherst (15,456) and Lower Chindwin districts (19,700). Of the total of 566,063 successful vaccinations reported in 1922-23, 488,208 were primary and 77,855 were revaccinations; of these again 149,939 were performed in children under one year of age and 251,662 in those between one and six years. The success rate of primary vacci- nations was 98.10 per cent. and of revaccinations 53.80 against 98.08 and 58.44 respectively in 1921-22 and 97.48 and 55.67 in 1920-21. On the whole, the protection afforded to the people of this province stands well in comparison with that obtaining in the other Indian Provinces, Burma heading the list with 40.82 per mille in 1921- 22 while Assam, Punjab and Bengal came next in order with 37.06, 34.80 and 32.40 respectively. In 1922-23 the ratio was still higher, 43.19. In 1921, the latest year for which information is available, the rate of mortality from small-pox was also the lowest except for the United Provinces. It is worth noting that in Lower Burma the relatively higher rate of protection enjoyed by the community in the period 1917-22 appears to have resulted in a pronounced fall in the rate of mortality from small-pox. This is shown in the following table:4 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA populated by Chittagonians being particularly severely affected. A number of extra Vaccinators were employed between February and May 1922, and a vigorous vaccination campaign was started resulting in the revaccination of a very large number of persons. One of the Vaccinators was convicted at Minbya for illegal collection of money from people of Chaunggyi, was fined Rs. 100 and dismissed from Government service. Another was dismissed for falsification of his diary. It appears that for several years little or no vaccination was done in many of the affected villages, and in consequence the people were highly susceptible to an outbreak. The Civil Surgeon remarks that these Chittagonian settlers hide their children whenever a Vacci- nator visits them, and the enforcement of a thorough house to house inspection to determine the exact number of unprotected persons is diffi- cult, owing to caste prejudice and the purdah system. An additional Vaccinator was however sent to this area to meet all contingencies. It is hoped that the lesson learnt by these Chittagonians will not be quickly forgotten and it would be well were the Akyab District Council to follow the lead of Thayetmyo and Tharrawaddy and apply for an extension of the Vaccination Acts, in order to obtain the necessary powers to enforce vaccination among the recalcitrant foreign element in their population. Kyaukpyu district showed an increase of 29,988 operations, of which only 17,581 were primary. Most of the operations were per- formed in rural areas. The presence of small-pox was a factor contri- buting to the increase. This district has been without a Supervisor of Vaccination from the 38th February 1922 to the 31st March 1923. The work in Sandoway district referred to last year as being very unsatisfactory is showing signs of improvement. There were in 1922-23, 9,662 operations (7,452 primary) of which 6,685 were successful, this being the highest figure for several years. This result is said by the Deputy Commissioner to be due to the strong stimulus given by the Civil Surgeon Dr. Gupta. Small-pox was also prevalent in several villagesFOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. 5 Extension of Vaccination, extended to these districts in 1916 has worked well and in view of their position surrounding Rangoon, which, as pointed out by Colonel Williams in the triennial report for 1914-15 to 1916-17, is the main portal of small pox in this province, it is worthy of consideration whether the Vaccination Acts of 1880 and 1909 should not be extended to those two districts forthwith. Including steamer vaccinations (18, 143) the number of operations performed in Rangoon in 1922-23 was 46,6066 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA The large increase in Myaungmya is attributed to a small-pox scare. Karens are said to welcome vaccination in all districts, while Burmans submit to it as a necessary evil. In Ma-ubin district primary vaccinations were four times as numerous as revaccinations, and it is suggested that an intensive campaign of revaccination should be undertaken. The district has been comparatively free from small-pox for some time and this should be treated as a danger sign. A small outbreak of small-pox occurred from inoculation by Burmese Sayas and the Township Officer is stated to be making enquiry. In Kyaiklat and Dedayè townships(Pyapôn district) 27 and 15 children respective- ly have been inoculated and the Sayas are being prosecuted. In Henzada district several parents of children in different villages were prosecuted for inoculating their children, and sentenced to a fine of Rs. 20 each or 21 days rigorous imprisonment. Other cases are under enquiry. Vaccination in this district has made considerable progress during the Civil Surgeoncy of Dr. Isa Charan and he is to be congratulated on the success achieved. Tenasserim Division.FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. 7 with that at Yamèthin came to an end in 1921-22. Out of the 905 prosecutions instituted in Mandalay town under the Vaccination Act in 1922-23 only 12 cases were fined, the total amount realized by fines having been Rs. 12. This is disappointing and it is obvious that such small fines can have no deterrent effect. The Civil Surgeon reports that the attitude of the people in the rural areas is more favourable to vaccination and that they appreciate its benefits. In Maymyo town the protection of the population against small- pox is stated to be very good. Myingyan, Magwe and Minbu all showed an increase in primary as well as revaccinations, the result of epidemic small-pox. The epidemic was prolonged by the action of inoculators who were very active. In Minzu and Letkokpin villages (Magwe district) 150 and 131 cases respectively were inoculated by Burmese Sayas and similar occurrences have been reported by the Civil Surgeons of Myingyan and Minbu, but no action was possible against them as the Act of 1908 has not yet been extended to these districts. The Deputy Commissioner, Myingyan, believes, contrary to the opinion of his predecessor, that Township Officers are evincing considerable interest in vaccination. He says that several headmen in Pagan township approached him with the request that vaccinators might be sent as their villages had not been visited for several years. The system of concentrated work continued in force in Meiktila and Myingvan districts, but the results have not been satisfactory. Myingyan reverted in January 1923 to the old system of each Vaccinator touring in his own township. There was no small-pox stimulus in Kyauksè district where revaccinations were few but primary vaccinations more than in the preceding year. Vaccination here is reported to be popular and the Vaccinators well known and liked by the people. The progress of vaccination in Meiktila district has been retarded by the activity of Wunthanu Associations with the result that there has been a slight fall in primary vaccination and a heavy decline (from 2,377 to 516) in revaccination. The prevalence of plague and the absence of small-pox were also contributory causes to the decline. Both the Civil Surgeon and the Deputy Commissioner strongly urge the introduction of compulsory vaccination in this district. North-East Frontier Division 8 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA In Bhamo the work was not systematized and the Vaccinators were left much to their own devices without any programme. The Civil Surgeon is remedying this defect. North-West Border Division.FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. 9 performed were Rangoon, Tharrawaddy, Amherst and Magwe, and the percentage of success 52.41, 70.04, 42.21 and 56.51 respectively against 71.68 for Akyab. 7. Vaccination in Jails.10 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Supervisor Staff suffered loss by the death of one (Amherst district), resignation of one (Sandoway District), removal of one (Myaungmya district) and dismissal of two (Minbu and Thatôn districts). Eight Vaccinators, viz., two each from Akyab, Ma-ubin and Myaugmya dis- tricts and one each from Upper Chindwin and Lower Chindwin districts were either removed or dismissed from the service. Two out of the three Head Vaccinators employed in the Southern Shan States, have since resigned their appointments and their places are still vacant for want of suitable candidates. 11. Vaccination by &quot;other agencies.&quot;FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. 11 In Kyaukpyu success rates of 95.42 and 47.35 were claimed by Vaccinators for primary and revaccinations respectively whereas of the 1,600 persons examined by Civil Surgeons for primary operations 70 per cent. were found successful and of 938 examined for revaccination 26 per cent. were found successful. In Hanthawaddy the Supervisor reported 68 per cent. primary successes against 99 per cent. claimed by Vaccinators and 97 per cent. calculated by the Civil Surgeon. Other districts in which similar disparities in verification of primary opera- tions prevailed are Prome, Myaungmya and Mergui. 13. Cost of the Department.12 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1920-21 TO 1922-23. number of calves, and the disparity between the supply and demand naturally raised the price of calves. The purchase price in 1922-23 of 303 calves was Rs. 3,939, and the feeding charges amounted to Rs. 2,630. The sum realized by the sale of 334 calves was Rs. 2,563. The net expenditure of the Vaccination Department in 1922-23 was Rs. 24,706, being Rs. 3,930 less than in 1921-22. The chief items of decrease were the salary of the Assistant Director who is a com- paratively junior officer, and the reduced cost of European Stores. A sum of Rs. 289 was realized by sale of lymph and Rs. 735 have still to be recovered on this account. The sales were as follows:APPENDICES PAGE STATEMENT NO. I14 APPENDICES.

NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 1. Vaccination Staff employed.2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA 544,341 were primary operations and 208,106 re-vaccinations. Out of 41 districts from which reports have been received, 14 districts show a total decrease of 46,280 as compared with their last year's figure, while the remaining 27 districts return an increase of 100,898 opera- tions. Thus there has been a net increase of 54,618 operations under both heads. Of these, 23,323 were primary and 31,295 re-vaccinations. The increase in many instances has resulted from the prevalence of small-pox in various parts of the Province. In comparison with last year, Akyab shows the greatest falling off of vaccination work (FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 3 one showing an increase this year, i.e., 127 operations more than were done last year. In the Rangoon Division, Hanthawaddy shows good work with an increase of 1,553. Of the Pegu Division, with the exception of Toungoo District, all districts show an increase in primary vaccination; the fall in Toungoo District amounted to 2,041 operations and this is reported to have been due to several changes amongst the vaccination staff owing to illness. The appointments of District Vaccinators in Pyu (B) and Railway Towns Circles had to be left vacant for two and one months respectively for this reason. In spite of this, Pegu Division as a whole has a net increase of 1,873 primary operations over its previous year's work. Upper Burma Diviions and districts have all done well, with the exception of Magwe and Upper Chindwin. In Mandalay Division, every district shows a marked increase with the exception of Magwe, which gives a decrease of 2,132 primary vaccinations. The remaining six districts of this division contribute a total increase of 7,064, Yamèthin heading the list with an increase of 2,453, Mandalay following next with an increase of 1,507. The return under the head of successful primary vaccinations for Magwe District last year was 20,213, while this year it was 18,081,4 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA (confluent) and this accounts for the increase of 2,495 cases under re-vaccination. Thayetmyo, Thatôn and Tavoy report a noticeable' increase in the number of successful re-vaccinations,FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 5 per cent. Putao returns the lowest rate of 86.60 per cent. but this, the Civil Surgeon explains, was due to the fact that a large number of cases have to remain unverified owing to the vast area included, and to the fact that the escort Sub-Assistant Surgeon and others on duty are unable to return by the same route as that taken on the outward journey. 6. Vaccination Towns.6 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Yamèthin with 33.17 per cent., Wakèma with 32.42 per cent., Mergui 30.72 per cent., Yenangyaung 29.34 per cent. Pakôkku 27.73 per cent., Henzada 27.55 per cent. and Sagaing 26.20 per cent. These towns are incurring a grave danger which they would do well to realise. It has been pointed out elsewhere that the registration of births in many towns is not satisfactory and this naturally militates against improving the state of vaccination in such towns. Statt. III. 8. Dispensary Vaccination.FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 7 verifying re-vaccination done by the former class of officers is about the same as in the last year (6.52 per cent. for the current year against 6.80 for last year); whereas the latter class of officers claim to have verified 43.23per cent. as against 41.92 for last year. Veri- fication done by Inspectors in districts where large numbers were pri- marily vaccinated was as follows :8 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA and to recover the cost for culpable wastage from those responsible. Such reports have been received from 18 places. The Director of the Vaccine Depôt states that some difficulty is experienced in selling calves after vaccination. Only female calves are used in the Depôt, and on an average 25 to 30, of ages between 9 and 18 months, are available for sale each month. The Veterinary Adviser to the Government of Burma has been addressed on this point in the hope that he may be able to suggest a market for these calves. During the year certain experiments were carried out at the Depôt. Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Maung Kyaw Din, inoculated a calf and a rabbit with a mixture which was being used by Burmese Sayas of Minbu District and which was reported to produce vesicles and to protect against small-pox. The constituents of the mixture were mare's milk, pink resin and python's gall, and needless to say the inoculation resulted in failure. The same animals were later vacci- nated successfully with stock lymph. Possibly the Sayas added small-pox crust to their mixture and produced true small-pox ! Two calves of the same size and colour (bearing Nos. 338 and 339) were inoculated with lymph No. 326. On the fourth day after inoculation calf No. 339 had the better vesicles while those of the other calf were poor. An abdominal binder, soaked in distilled water was applied three hourly to calf No 338 the one with poorer vesicles. On the fifth day the calves were scraped and No. 338 produced twice as much lymph as the other. Though it is too early to judge of the quality of the lymph produced, it would seem that the application of moisture increases the quantity when the weather is hot. Instructions are being issued to test this point very carefully. Rangoon Corporation Vaccine Depôt was closed from 1st April 1923, and lymph was obtained from Meiktila throughout the year under report, the total lymph provided to Rangoon amounting to 29,224 tubes. 14. Training Class.FOR THE YEAR 1923-24. 9 case of successful vaccination. The increase in the average cost per case at Mergui is due to (1) the revised pay sanctioned for the Town Vaccinators and (2) the grant of four months' leave on average pay with allowances for the permanent incumbent, and the appointment of a substitute. The estimated cost per case in the Hill Districts of Pakôkku and Arakan does not seem to call for any comment, considering the fact that the population is scattered and communi- cations difficult, and that Vaccinators have been in receipt of increased rates of pay. The same remarks apply to Myitkyina and Katha Districts. 16. General Remarks.APPENDICES PAGE STATEMENT No. I12 APPENDICES.

Notes and Statistics ON Vaccination in Burma FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 1. Vaccination Staff employed.2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA of 112,450 as compared with last year's figure, while the remaining 18: districts return a decrease of 58,278. Thus there has been a net increase of 54,172 operations. The increase is wholly derived from revaccination, there having been a considerable fall in primary cases. The increase in revaccination, in many instances, has resulted from the prevalence of small-pox in many parts of the Province. In comparison, with last year, Rangoon shows the largest increase in revaccination (33,380), followed by Sagaing (12,676) ; whereas the largest falling off in primary vaccination has been in Thaton (FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 3 Border and Mandalay Divisions show a considerable falling off in successful primary vaccination, as compared with the previous year's figure. In the former Division, the deficit, which amounts to 9,135, is shared by all districts except Pakôkku Hill Tracts and Chin Hills, the principal defaulters being Pakôkku (4 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA under report, the Acts have been extended to the rural areas under the control of the District Councils of Toungoo, Thatôn, Amherst, Tavoy, Henzada, Ma-ubin, Bassein, Pyapôn, Myaungmya, Magwe, Minbu, Pegu, Kyauksè, Insein, Hanthawaddy and Akyab and it is hoped that other districts will follow suit, so that the Acts may soon be extended to all parts of the Province. The people are gradually appreciating the benefit of vaccination to which on the whole they seem less antagonistic than they were previously. The opposition which, through ignorance and prejudice, is sometimes shown in some quarters is sure to vanish at no distant date. The few people, who, like the Mahomedan settlers of Maungdaw Township of Akyab District, are hopelessly indifferent and always turn a deaf ear to advice and persuasion, must be compelled to submit to vaccination by the application of the Vaccination Acts.

There may be some truth in these explanations, but the real cause seems to be that the Vaccination Acts are not rigorously enforced in many towns.

Very poor results have been reported from Minbu (37), Henzada (8.44), and Northern Shan States (1.75), but the Civil Surgeon, Minbu, appears to have many difficulties to contend with. 13. Vaccine Depôt, Meiklila.FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 9 The net expenditure of the Depôt amounted to Rs. 15,672-5-9 or a decrease of Rs. 2,264-2-7 and Rs. 9,033-15-5 in comparison with the figures for 1923-24 and 1922-23 respectively. The decrease is chiefly in the direction of establishment, travelling allowance, and supplies and services. The cost of feeding calves has slightly increased, while the receipts on account of the sale of lymph and vaccinated calves have increased by Rs. 1,072-2-4 over the last year's figures. A sum of Rs. 1,217 is still due, so the total increase in receipts amounts to Rs. 2,289-2-4 under this head. 14. Training Class.APPENDICES. PAGE STATEMENT No. I.12 APPENDICES.

Resolution ON THE Triennial Report on Vaccination in Burma For the years 1923-24 to 1925-26. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma, Department of Public Health,Triennial Report ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the years 1923-24 to 1925-26. 1. General Review.2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA population. During the last ten years 1916 to 1925 over 20,000 lives have been lost by this disease, and now at the close of 1925 the disease is still spreading in many districts. It is gratifying however to note that the importance of vaccination and the prevention of inoculation is being recognized and that, led by the District Councils of Tharrawaddy and Thayetmyo, most District Councils have adopted the Vaccination Acts which have now been extended to all districts in Lower Burma, with the exception of the Hill Districts of Arakan, Kyaukpyu, Sandoway and Salween Districts. The Acts have also been extended to four districts in Upper Burma (viz., Thayetmyo, Magwe, Minbu and Kyauksè) and to the Shan States, while the Burma prohibition of Inoculation and Licensing of Vaccinators Act has been extended to Pakôkku, Yamèthin, Sagaing, Mandalay, Shwebo, Lower Chindwin, Upper Chindwin, Katha, Kyaukpyu and Sandoway. It is hoped that before long it will be possible to extend the Vaccination Acts to all areas under the control of District Councils. Statement 1. 2. Total Operations.FOR THE YEARS 1923-24 TO 1925-26. 3 fact that fewer re-vaccinations were done. In Yamèthin District 38,081 fewere-vaccinations were done as compared with the previous triennium,4 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA May 1924 throughout the area administered by the District Council, but it does not appear that the rules framed thereunder for the proper enforcement of the Act have yet been properly brought into effect. Third on the list in which a decline in the output of primary operations was reported in Kyaukpyu District. The falling-off in this district was similarly due to the absence of small-pox during the years 1923 and 1924, only a few cases occurring in 1925, whereas the disease had been present in the two previous years, especially in 1922 when 100 deaths from small-pox were reported. The output of vaccination in that particular year was the highest on record during the last ten years. Considering the lack of travelling facilities in this district and the fact that vaccination is voluntary, the average number of operations performed by each vaccinator per month was not so bad as in some other districts. In 1923-24 each man vaccinated on the average 140 cases, the output rose to 161 per month in 1924-25, and in 1925-26 the average was 234 cases per month. The other districts which show a large decrease in the amount of primary vaccination are Thatôn (FOR THE YEARS 1923-24 TO 1925-26. 5 Prome (99.34), Pegu and Myaungmya (99.26) and Magwe (99.22). The district with the lowest successful rate was Minbu (88.34), the next being the Hill District of Arakan (89.51). Other districts which returned a success-rate of less than 95 per cent. were Shwebo (93.20), Salween .(94.40), Mergui (93.43) and Bassein (94.80). The low rates of Shwebo, Minbu, and Bassein Districts were apparently due to bad technique on the part of vaccinators, whereas the low rates in the Hill Districts of Arakan, Mergui and Salween District may have been due to delay in transit of lymph from Meiktila. In the remaining districts the percentage of successful cases varied from 95 to 98. Statement I. 5. Re-vaccination.6 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA 1923-24. Thus there was a decrease of 41,999 operations over the out- put of the previous year, but an increase over that of 1923-24 by 16,850 operations. Of the total operations 46,565 were primary-and 66,190 re-vaccination cases, the percentage success in primary being 98.60 and in re-vaccinations 46.88, as compared with 98.87 in primary and 52.89 in re-vaccination in 1924-25. In 31 towns the output shows an increase, and in 32 towns a decrease. The towns which show a marked increase in primary vaccination, work were Prome, Shwedaung, Paungdè, Moulmein, Mergui, Pyu Thayetmyo, and Yamèthin. 7. Re-vaccination in Towns.FOR THE YEARS ,1923-24 TO 1925-26. 7 disease, death before vaccination, or departure from the locality were among the reasons given for the, discrepancy. It would appear that in these, places no children .could have come into the town from outside, or that if any did come they must have escaped the notice of the vaccinating authorities. Statement III. 9. Dispensary Vaccination.8 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Statement V. 13. Verification Work of Inspecting Officers.FOR THE YEARS 1923-24 TO 1925-26. 9 14. Establishment.10 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA as the staff is on the time-scale of pay; The increase under the head &quot;Contingencies&quot; was due to the increased expenditure under this item at theVaccine Depôt , Meiktila. The average cost per successful case of vaccination during the year was Rs. 0-9-7 as compared with Re. 0-9-6 in 1924-25 and Re. 0-9-3 in 1923-24. The districts which returned high rates for each successful case in 1924-25 with the exception of Mergui also returned a high rate during 1925-26, viz., Hill Districts of Arakan (Re. 1-12-3), Pakôkku Hill Tracts (Re. 1-5-2), and Myitkyina (Re. 1-1-2). In Mergui the average rate of Re. 1-6-9 in 1924-25 was reduced to Re. 0-13-0 in 1925-26. In Tavoy District the rate was also high, viz., Re. 1-2-4, but was slightly less than that of the previous year Re. 1-2-9. The high rate in Insein District (Re. 1-1-11) was due to the inclusion of pay and allowances drawn by the Sanitary Inspectors who do vaccination-inspection work in the district. In 17 districts the rates were higher than the Provincial average rate and in 24 districts they were lower. 16.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON Vaccination in Burma For the years 1926-27 to 1928-29. Statement General Review.2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA more remote areas are reluctant to have their children vaccinated before the end of the first year. With the increasing propaganda work now being carried out by the Public Health and Vaccination Staffs, there is some prospect of vaccination improving still further, but more efficient supervision of the work is greatly needed and must await the urgently needed development of a rural public health service. During the triennium, the Vaccination Acts were extended to two more districts, viz. Mandalay from March 1927 and Shwebo from January 1929. These Acts have now been extended to the Lower Chindwin District from April 1929 and it is hoped that the District Council of Sagaing and others will follow suit. The beneficial results on deaths from small-pox of the extension of the Vaccination Acts are clearly brought out in the following table, which indicates the need for extension of these Acts to those districts whose Councils have not yet adopted compulsory primary vaccination and have therefore neglected to avail themselves of the means at their disposal for checking the ravages of this serious disease. Great credit is due to the District Councils of Tharrawaddy and Thayetmyo for their pioneer work in this respect. Districts where Vaccination Act was extended in 1923. (Deaths from Small-pox).

In the last year of the triennium: 1928-29 the out break subsided, only 51 deaths being registered and simultaneously the output of vaccination went down to 27,693. Of the 18 districts which recorded a decrease, Pakôkku topped the list with a deficit of 23,004. The reasons furnished by the District Health Officer were a reduced incidence of small-pox and non-employ- ment of additional temporary staff, whereas in the previous triennium small-pox was more prevalent and additional temporary staff was entertained to cope with it. The steady decline in this district since 1924-25 up to 1927-28 requires further elucidation. In 1923-24, the output recorded was 34,351 ; it went down to 26,914 in 1924-25 and from this year onwards the decline is continuous up to 1927-28. In 1925-26 the output was 24,822, in 1926-27, 20,780 and in 1927-28, 20,477. There was only a slight rise in 1928-29, viz. 21,826 or an increase of 1,349 over the previous year's output. A very unsatisfactory feature is the reduction in primary vaccination. The next district which returned a large deficit is Upper ChindwinFOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29. 5 operations was registered in the Chin Hills and Katha districts, In the remaining 18 districts the increase is not marked. The increase recorded in the Southern Shan States is commendable, in view of the fact that people in this area are very ignorant, there are difficulties in communication and the villages are widely scattered. In the 17 districts from which a deficit is returned in primary operations, Mandalay stands at the top of the list with 9,095 fewer operations followed by the Upper Chindwin with a deficit of 7,685. A deficit of over 5,000 is reported from Insein and Henzada, over 4,000 from Kyaukpyu, Myaungmya and Ma-ubin and over 3,000 from Sando- way, Myingyan and Sagaing. The decrease in primary cases in Myaungmya, Pyapôn, Mergui and Lower Chindwin is covered by the increase in re-vaccination cases in these districts. In the remaining districts there is a decrease under both classes of vaccinations and these are the same districts in which a large deficit in total operations is recorded, as noted in paragraph 2 above. Statement I. 4. Successful Primary Operations.6 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Shan States and a success rate below 98 per cent. but above 95 per cent. was recorded in Hanthawaddy, Insein, Thatôn, Tavôy, Minbu, Mandalay, Myingyan, Yamèthin, Shwebo and Southern Shan States. In the remaining districts which are not mentioned here, the success rates vary between 90 and 95 per cent. On the whole, the success rate obtained in 1928-29 in all the districts, with the exception of the four remote ones mentioned above, is very satisfactory. The district which reported the lowest success rate is Chin Hills (82.75 per cent.), but the lymph takes ten days to reach there from Meiktila and hence the potency is partly lost during transit. The low success rate of 86.35 per cent. in Sandoway District is partly due to poor communications and partly to unwillingness on the part of the people to have three insertions on the arms of the children. The matter is receiv- ing the attention of this Department and an Epidemic Sub-Assistant Surgeon has been detailed to the district to carry out vaccination pro- paganda work and also to supervise the work of vaccinators. Mergui also reported a low success rate of 85.76 per cent. Here also com- munications are bad. Statement I. 5. Re-vaccination.FOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29. 7 (=5,630). In the above districts, with the exception of Thatôn and Myingyan, the prevalence of small-pox was low and hence the reduction in re-vaccination. In Thatôn district, although the number of deaths from small-pox recorded during the current triennium is slightly higher than that recorded in the previous period; re-vaccination work shows a marked decline. In Myingyan district, the incidence of small-pox during the two periods is about the same, but re-vaccination work shows a serious falling off, with the result that the disease has apparently gained a strong foothold and is still prevalent, both in town and district. The Vaccination Acts are not in force in this district and the Local Authorities are reluctant to extend them, although the necessity for doing so has been urged on them by this Department. The District Council, in my opinion, must bear a share of responsibility for the serious outbreak of small-pox which has recently occurred. The percentage of success in re-vaccination in 1928-29 was 36.22 as compared with 39.88 in 1927-28 and 35.97 in 1926-27. A high per- centage of successful re-vaccinations was reported from Bassein town 95.80. It may be noted that in the Northern Shan States, vaccination work is carried out for only six months in the year from October to March. The District Health Officer suggests altering this system. 6. Vaccination in Towns.8 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA 7. Re-vaccination in Towns.FOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29. 9 Toungoo, only 269 children were successfully vaccinated out of 425 survivors and in Shwegyin only 59 were vaccinated out of 161. The reasons given were the same as for Pyu. In Akyab, 100 children were thus left unprotected, in Thôngwa 130 and in Thatôn 110. No reasons are forthcoming for the deficits in the vaccination reports submitted from these towns. The various reasons for the excess or deficit in infant vaccinations noted above have been discussed in previous reports; the most important being defective registration of births, defective upkeep of vaccination registers, migration of children, postponement of vaccination on medical grounds and non-employment of proper vaccination and supervising staffs. The employment of whole-time Health Officers with adequate powers in these towns seems to be the only solution of the problem. Statement I (Summary). 9.

Steamer Vaccination:FOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29. 11 Reviewing the work of Inspectors of Vaccination and other inspecting officers in rural areas of the districts, the work done in Tharrawaddy, Amherst, Magwe, Yamèthin, Sagaing and Lower Chindwin Districts is worthy of mention. In each of these districts, only a single Inspector of Vaccination is employed, yet they inspected a larger number of cases than the Inspectors of any other district. In Tharrawaddy, the results of 63.88 per cent. of the total vaccinations were inspected by the Inspector of Vaccination. The Inspector of Amherst inspected 32.45 per cent., Magwe 45.19 per cent., Yamèthin 40.13 per cent., Sagaing 62.29 per cent. and Lower Chindwin 46.70 per cent. In the districts in which two Inspectors are employed viz., Pegu, Insein, Hanthawaddy, Prome, Bassein, Henzada, Myaungmya, Ma-ubin, Pyapôn, Toungoo, Thatôn and Katha, the work done by the Inspectors of Pegu, Myaungmya, Ma-ubin and Pyapôn should be regarded as satisfactory as each inspected the results of over 10,000 vaccinations. In the Report for 1927-28, the work of the two Inspectors in Thatôn district has been criticised and in that year each of them verified the results of 5,294 vaccinations. During 1928-29, they inspected 6,531 each12 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA Statement II. 14.

Prosecutions under the Vaccination Acts.FOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29. 15 Fifteen cow-calves and four buffalo-calves either failed to take or yielded lymph of such poor quality that it had to be destroyed. The following Table compares the output and issue of lymph during the years of the triennium :16 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1926-27 TO 1928-29 charges. On the 13th October 1928, a system of hiring calves for vaccination was introduced which has been found satisfactory and economical. The cost of Europe medicines and instruments was Rs. 3,717-13-7 and Rs. 195 was spent on petty construction and repairs. On contingencies including postage and telegrams a sum of Rs. 6,863-6-0 was expended. There were severe outbreaks of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease among the calves towards the end of 1928, which caused great anxiety and financial loss. The advice of the Veterinary Department. was obtained and special precautions taken to prevent future outbreaks. A quarantine stable is urgently required, and plans and estimates have been submitted and sent up to Government for sanction. 19. Training Class.APPENDICES. PAGE STATEMENT No. I18 APPENDICES.

NOTES AND STATISTICS ON Vaccination in Burma For the year 1929-30. 1. Establishment.2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION During the year under review the Vaccination Acts of 1880 and 1909 were extended to the areas under the District Councils of Lower Chindwin, Myingyan and Meiktila. Thanks are due to U Shwe Mya, Chairman of the Myingyan District Council for his strong support of this important and progressive measure which should have a far reaching effect in the heavily infected district of Myingyan. For lack of funds to meet the cost of additional staff required for the proper working of the Acts, these could not be extended to the Yamèthin District Council area this year, and the matter is still under consideration. The map of Burma attached to this Report shows the area of Burma in which compulsory primary vaccination is in force. Only in a few backward tracts such as the excluded areas of Mergui and Akyab, and to a certain extent in the Myingyan District, was there any opposition to vaccination, but parents in the hill tracts of the Bhamo and Katha Districts prefer vaccination of their children after the first year of life. Some parents in the backward areas of Mergui evaded vaccination of their children by removing them to the jungle on the vaccinator's and District Health Officer's visits. Chittagonians in the Akyab District are very difficult to vaccinate, and in that respect are a great contrast to the Arakanese who come forward readily. Statement I. 3. Total Number of Persons Vaccinated.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. 3 apparently genuine desire for co-operation with the District Health Officer, who, ably assisted by the Assistant District Health Officer, has obtained creditable results under difficult circumstances. The District Health Officer has represented the need to apply the Re-vaccination Act (Act IV of 1928) to the District and Town of Meiktila. The Act is at present not applicable to rural areas. Though the districts of Sagaing, Pakokku and Hanthawaddy were comparatively free from small-pox, vaccination work shows a decided improvement, due to special efforts of supervising officers and energetic work by the staffs concerned. The continued prevalence of an epidemic of small-pox in Kyauksè District acted as a stimulus for more vaccination. An unusual reason for the enhanced number of operations in Bassein District is given : &quot; Burmese sages predicted an outbreak of small-pox in the year 1930-31 and the people resorted to vaccination as a means of protection against it.&quot; It is interesting to note that this prediction coincides with forecasts by several Health Authorities of a general small-pox pandemic about this time. Of the 16 districts which report deficits over last year, Mandalay takes first place with4 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION District is attributable to the continuance of last year's small-pox outbreak, though in a lesser degree. The improvement in primary vaccination in Akyab and Bassein Districts is in accordance with the general rise in vaccination, and has been commented on in paragraph 4. Deficits are returned from only 15 districts, and in six of these a large fall-off was registered : Northern Shan States (IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. 5 as compared with 42,045 in the previous year, leaving 19,337 failures as against 16,585 in 1928-29. Of the total of 575,113 successful primary vaccinations, 166,766 were on infants under one year of age, and 312,378 on children of one to six years. The remaining 95,969 successful primary vaccinations were on persons over six years of age. The percentage of success, in primary vaccinations of which the results were known, is 96.75, as compared with 97.11 in the previous year. The districts which return success rates over 99 per cent are Bhamo (100 per cent), Tharrawaddy (99.95 per cent), Myaungmya 99.95per cent), Pegu (99.81 per cent), Henzada (99.48 per cent), Prome (99.17 per cent) and Maubin (99.05 per cent), and below 90 per cent are Chin Hills (75.37 per cent), Mergui (84.17 per cent), Hill District of Arakan (84.89 per cent), Myitkyina (89.29 per cent), and Sandoway (89.55 per cent). The remaining districts report success rates between 90 and 99 per cent. Of the 356,459 re-vaccinations, 103,182 were successful, as against 99,118 in the previous year. The percentage of success in re-vaccina- tions of which the results were known is 34.55, as against 36.22 in the previous year. 8. Vaccination in Towns.6 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION In Moulmein and Akyab the presence of small-pox in a virulent form, and the employment of an additional vaccinator to cope therewith in the latter town, are the causes of the increased number re-vaccinated during the year. Good work by the staff with efficient supervision was probably the cause of the improvement in Syriam, which was free from small-pox during the year. Comparative freedom from small-pox and an exceptionally large number operated upon during the previous year were the causes of the decrease in Monywa, and this year's figure 139 compares favourably with that of 1927-28 which was only 105. Revaccination work in Rangoon has gradually decreased since 1927-28 when 82,992 operations were performed, against 29,253 in 1928-29 and 21,487 this year. Comparative freedom from small-pox was probably the cause. 9. Results of Vaccination in Towns.IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. 7 On the other hand, very low proportions of infant survivors were vaccinated in Lashio, Ye-U, Taunggyi, Wakèma, Minbu and Sandoway; while Kalaw registered 66 births and 5 deaths, but no vaccination was done. This is a sure indication that the Rules under the Vaccination Acts were not enforced in these towns, though whole-time town- vaccinators were employed in Taunggyi, Wakèma and Minbu. This matter will be taken up with the authorities concerned. 11. Dispensary Vaccination.8 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION District Health Officers inspected the result of 114,211 or 11 .60 per cent which compares favourably with 10.45 per cent in the previous year. Inspectors of Vaccination and other Inspecting Officers verified the results of 347,993 or 55.41 per cent of primary cases and 154,520 or 43.37 per cent of re-vaccinations, as against 50.84 and 39.23 per cent respectively during the previous year. The District and Assistant District Health Officers of Meiktila inspected 88.51 per cent of primary and 52.14 per cent of re-vaccinations. The District Health Officers of Tavoy (45.23 and 42.69), Sagaing (41.07 and 2.40), Northern Shan States (38.30 and 12.94), and Upper Chindwin (31.20 and 22.58) carried out high percentages of verification work, while those of Akyab, Kyaukpyu, Hanthawaddy, Prome, Myaungmya, Pyapon, Mandalay, Yamèthin, Shwebo and Lower Chindwin verified less than 4 per cent of primary vaccinations. The procedure adopted in Sandoway District deserves mention. While vaccinated children were being collected by the village Thugyi (Head- man), the District Health Officer made a house-to-house visit and induced parents to bring unprotected children, if found, to the Thugyi's house, at the same time taking a note of children who were protected as well as those who were under one year of age. The Vaccination. Register was then checked with the names of the children collected, and unprotected children were vaccinated. The Birth Register was checked with the names of the infants under one year of age at the same time. High percentages of verification of both primary and re-vaccinations are reported by the Inspectors of Vaccination in the Districts of Pegu, Maubin, Tavoy, Thayetmyo, Kyauksè, Meiktila, Upper Chindwin, and Southern Shan States. The work of Inspectors of Vaccination in the following districts is poor :IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1929-30. 9 17. Small-pox Inoculation.10 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION The average yield per cow-calf increased from 36.30 grammes in 1928-29 to 46.23 grammes in 1929-30, and I desire to congratulate the Director of the Depôt on this highly successful result. There was an opening balance of 2,988 grammes of lymph carried over from the previous year, and 15,354 grammes were manufactured during the year. Out of this total of 18,342 grammes, 12,742 were issued, 1,180 used as seed lymph and a closing balance of 4,420 has been carried over to the year 1930-31.

TRIENNIAL REPORT ON Vaccination in Burma For the official years (April to March) 1929-30 to 1931-32. GENERAL REVIEW2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA The presence of an epidemic of smallpox gives rise to an increased number of vaccinations and revaccinations, as at that time the people are more alive to the dangers of the disease and to the benefits of vacci- nation. Thus, the vaccination figures for Akyab, Sagaing, Amherst and Rangoon, each of which had an epidemic, show a marked increase. It is pleasing however to note that an increase in vaccinations took place in some districts without the unpleasant stimulus of an epidemic. In these districts such a welcome improvement is to be ascribed to an increased staff, a more rigid enforcement of the vaccination law and to better co-operation on the part of district officials and local bodies. Propaganda also has had its share in the success, as it has helped to educate the people to understand how the scourge of smallpox can be avoided. Continued and increased propaganda will be necessary to gain the wide appreciation of the public regarding the benefit of vaccination. Statement I. 2. Total OperationsFOR THE YEARS 1929-30 TO 1931-32. 3 Other districts returning a considerable increase are Amherst (+25,731), Mandalay ( + 22,233), Bassein ( +15,650), Insein ( + 15,480), Rangoon (+15,164), Pyapon ( + 14,802), Myaungmya ( + 12,665) and Mergui (+10,422). The increase in Amherst and Rangoon was mainly due to the presence of a smallpox epidemic. In Mandalay special efforts were made by the municipal health staff in 1930-31 to get the population vaccinated. The District Health Officer, Bassein, reports that a prediction was made by local Burmese sages that a severe outbreak of smallpox would occur in 1930-31 and this unusual reason accounts for the increased numbers who resorted to vaccination. In Insein district good vaccination work by the Hlegu Health Unit helped towards increased figures. There were a few cases of smallpox in Pyapon during the triennium, but none in Myaungmya. The increase in vaccination in these two districts is largely due to the appointment of wholetime Health Officers. Mergui district having been free from smallpox, the increase in vaccination speaks for the good work done by the District Health Officer and his staff.

The presiding magistrate passed orders for vaccination which were complied with. There were 38 prosecutions in Thaton district. In two, fines were imposed, and in the rest, orders for vaccination were passed by the presiding magistrate. In Amherst district, 13 prosecutions were made and the magistrate passed orders for vaccination which were complied with. In Mergui district, 43 prosecutions were made. The magistrate has passed orders for vaccination in 33 cases, but 10 cases were still pending at the time of report. In Minbu, 104 persons were prosecuted and fines totalling Rs. 77 were inflicted. In Myaungmya, 59 persons were prosecuted. The magistrate passed orders for the vaccination of the children concerned and these were complied with. SHAN STATES.12. TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA It will be seen that there is a steady increase in the average yield per calf from year to year during the last six years. The average yield per cow calf in 1930-31 and 1931-32 is double that of 1926-27. Studying the table again, it will be found that to obtain 36,304 grammes of lymph it was necessary in the last triennium to vaccinate 1,235 cow calves, whereas to obtain almost the same quantity of lymph (i.e. 34,657), it has been found necessary in this triennium to vaccinate only 700 cow calves, so about 500 calves were saved. This satisfactory progress is to be attributed to the gradual modernization of the Depôt, beginning with the year 1927. On 1st March 1927, a wholetime Director was appointed and was deputed to study the technique in lymph manufac- ture at the King's Institute, Guindy, Madras. Various improvements were carried out to the Depôt, such as the provision of a small bacteriological laboratory, a Benoid gas plant, a better system of water- supply, an ice-plant, an experimental animal house, a post-scraping stable, a Lister oil engine. Previously, the supply of calves was uncer- tain and at times it failed altogether. The Depôt has overcome these difficulties by resorting to a system of hiring calves from a contractor, and the supply has proved certain and regular. A sufficient supply of calves enabled the Director of the Depôt to vaccinate as many calves as could be accommodated in the cold weather months, when the yield is generally at its maximum. Another important factor that helped to increase the average yield of lymph was a reduction in the number of cows that did not take or that yielded poor quality of lymph. There were 33 cow calves of this description in 1926-27, 18 in 1927-28, 5 (also 4 buffalo calves) in 1928-29, 6 in 1929-30, 4 in 1930-31 and 3 only in 1931-32. This was probably due to more thorough isolation of unvaccinated calves and to the hire system of calves resorted to, which enabled the Director to take only healthy calves that were of suitable colour, size, etc. In 1931-32 there was an opening balance of 5,157 grammes of lymph carried over from the previous year, and 11,747 grammes were manufactured during the year. Of this total of 16,904 grammes of lymph, 12,717 grammes were issued during the year, 687 grammes were used as seed-lymph and a closing balance of 3,500 grammes has been carried over to the year 1932-33.

The Depôt was visited by me during the year, and I was very pleased with the progress made there and with the high standard of professional work. Several improvements are held up owing to financial stringency. They include the scheme for converting the old operation stable into menial quarters, the construction of a Kentucky septic tank latrine, and the building of a quarantine stable. E.
