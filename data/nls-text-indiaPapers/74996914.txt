No. 1156. FROM THE SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 12th of November 1877. SIR, I HAVE the honor to forward, for submission to the Right Hon'ble the Governor General in Council, the Medical and Sanitary Report of the Native Army in the Bengal Presidency for the year 1876 (forming the ninth of the series), the compilation of which has been completed, under my superin- tendence, by Surgeon-Major J. Browne, M. D., 41st Regiment Bengal Native Infantry, my Officiating Secretary. Compilation of report. 2. The orders conveyed in your docket Reports/Administrative' No. 328, of the 16th of June last, have not been lost sight of by me; and I have spared no exertions in trying to ensure the earlier compilation of this report; but I regret to say that a few medical officers (mostly junior in the service, for whom, perhaps, an excuse will be accepted on the score of inexperience) were unable from some cause or other to render their figured returns correctly, until they had been sent back for revision several times, the last only reaching this Office in a perfect shape on the 19th September. However, notwithstanding these delays, I was able to send the first instalment of my manuscript to the press on the 16th of July, and since then the succeeding portions of it were forwarded without any interruption. Next year I would fain hope that the officers who have created difficulty in the compilation of the present report will have so far benefited by their additional experience, as to steer clear of the errors and omissions which have led to so much correspondence and avoidable delay, and thus enable me to expedite still more in 1878 the submission of the report of the current year, so as to meet more fully the instructions of the Right Hon'ble the Secretary of State for India. The delay in the earlier submission of the report has been unavoid-able. STATEMENT No, I, STRENGTH. Present. Absent.

In Statement No. 1 is shewn the strength (present, absent and total) of the Native Army serv- ing in the Bengal Pre- sidency during 1876. In this statement, the strength, "present" will be understood to denote that which supplied the admissions into hospital, while the strength "ab- sent" accounts for those men who were away from their regiments on furlough, sick leave, &c., and also for those small detachments from which no statistical returns were received, in Strength of the Army.
ii Strength "present." Strength "absent." consequence of their not being under the special charge of any medical officer or subordinate. The strength of the Bengal Army "present" was 224 in excess of that shewn in 1875, while that of the Madras Army on duty in this Presidency was less by 569.7 men. This decrease in the strength of the contingent from Madras was due to the recall of the 33rd Regiment, M. N. I., no other regiment from the sister Presidency being sent in its place to Bengal. The proportion "absent" from the Regular Army was at the rate of 12.31 per cent. of total strength; from the Central India Force 21.23 per cent.; from the Punjab Frontier Force 17.11 per cent., and from the Madras regiments 5.91 per cent. In the report for 1875, I offered as a probable expla- nation of the small number of Madras sepoys absent from their regiments, as compared with that registered in the Bengal Army, that the Madras sepoys have their families with them as a rule, and being at such long distances from their homes do not care to avail themselves of leave to visit them. On the other hand, the high proportion of the strength "absent" from the Central India, and Punjab Frontier, Forces, is in a great measure due to the number of small detachments furnished by them.

In statement No. II is shewn the ratio of admissions and "daily sick" as calculated on the average strength "present," while the mortuary statistics represent the total deaths per cent. of total strength. For the sake of comparison, I have entered in the foregoing statement the corresponding statistics for the four preceding years. It will be perceived from it that, in the Regular Army, the proportion of admissions to the average strength was markedly in excess of that of any of the three previous years, but was less than that of 1872. In the Central India Force, the proportion of admissions was much the same as in 1873, 1874 or 1875, but was 20 per cent. less than in 1872. In the Punjab Force, the proportion of admissions was less than in any one of the four pre- ceding years; and taking the Bengal Army as a whole (composed of the Regu- lar Army, the Central India, and Punjab Frontier Forces) the admission-rate, though less than it was in 1872, was somewhat higher than in 1873, 1874 or 1875. It does not appear clear why there should have been an increase in the rate of admissions into hospital during the past year, or why that increase should have been confined altogether to the Regular Army, but I shall consider this subject more fully in para. 14.

In the Madras regiments. The admission-rate of the Madras troops was higher than it was in 1872, 1873 or 1875, but was slightly lower than it was in 1874. Comparison of the admis- sion-rates. From a comparison of the several admission-rates, it will be observed that the Punjab Frontier Force had the highest one, but this result might be accept- ed as a necessary consequence of the climate in which the regiments compos- ing it have to serve, and also of the nature of their duties which occasionally are harrassing, arduous and attended by considerable exposure. The admis- sion-rate of the Regular Army comes next in order, but it will be gathered from Statement No. VII, that in the Peshawar district it has even exceeded the highest figures shewn in Statement No. II, while in others it compares favorably
iii with that of the Central India Force. From the known unhealthiness of certain stations for sepoys recruited from the Upper Provinces and Oude, such a high admission-rate is not surprising, and the lower rate in other districts may be dependent in great part on a drier and more equable climate, as well, as on the lighter duties the sepoys have had to perform. A dry and equable climate may possibly exert a great influence on the admission-rate of the Central India Force, which has been considerably lower than any of the others. The admission-rate of the Madras troops (although much lower than that of either the Regular Army or Punjab Frontier Force) was higher than that of the Central India Force; and, as the conditions of climate were much the same for each, perhaps the circumstance of the Madras sepoys having to serve in what is to them a foreign country, or of having their families and relations with them, so that they cannot afford to take a sufficiently nourishing diet, will account for this apparent anomaly. 5. Reviewing the statistics supplied in Statement No. II still further, I may say that there has been but slight variation in the proportion of "daily sick" per cent. of average strength in the Bengal Army and its component parts during 1876 and the four preceding years, and whatever there has been was in favor of the year under review. The Punjab Frontier Force had, as usual, the highest proportion of daily sick; then the Regular Army, and lastly the Central India Force. It will be observed that the difference between the two former was but trifling, while that between the daily sick of the Central India and Punjab Frontier Forces amounted to 1.16 per cent. The daily sick of the Bengal Army, taken as a whole, was but 3.91 per cent. and may be con- sidered as very satisfactory. In the Madras regiments, the proportion of daily sick was only 2.59 per cent. of average strength. Daily sick. 6. In the Bengal Army, the proportion of the total mortality to the total strength was at the rate of 1.47 per cent., or 14.7 per mile. Such a result may be accepted as very favorable, and is particularly so when the great differences in the climate and other essential particulars of the many stations in this large Presidency are taken into account. The death-rate was highest in the Regular Army; but it has varied little from what was recorded in any one of the four preceding years. The Punjab Frontier Force stands second in its death-rate, which, for the past year, was.43 per cent. lower than the average of the four preceding years. The mortality in the Central India Force was at the low rate of.93 per cent. Mortality. In the Madras regiments, the mortality was at the rate of 1.23 per cent., which, although a favorable one, was nearly 1 per cent. above the average of the four preceding years. 7. The number of men constantly sick in hospital, and whose services were therefore lost to Government, was 2,103, or equal to 2.94 battalions, each of 715 men, against 3.02 in 1875 and 3.27 in 1874. Each case was under treatment for an average of 9.89 days against 11.02 in 1875 and 11.2 in 1874, and each sepoy of the entire army spent 12.28 days in hospital, against 13.03 and 13 days in 1875 and 1874, respectively. In addition, also, 1,185 men, of 1.89 per cent. of total strength, proceeded on sick leave against 2.02,1.6,2.08,2.4 and 2.10 in the preceding quinquennial period. The number of days spent on sick leave by these men was 150,314, which gives an average of 410.7 men constantly absent on this account, or equal to.57 of a battalion. It will thus be understood from the foregoing figures that 1,595.7 men were permanently ineffective from sickness during the year, or at the rate of 2.96 per cent. of strength (present); a number equal to a loss of 2.2 battalions of 715 men. In 1875 and 1874, the proportion of men constantly ineffective was 4.88 and 4.86 per cent. Statistics of sickness. 8. The total number of deaths was 922 against 1,026 and 819 in 1875 and 1874, respectively. Of these, 555 occurred in hospital, against 674 and 536 in 1875 and 1874, 13 occurred in the lines, as compared with 33 and 25 in 1875 and 1874, and 354 men died when absent from their regiments on sick leave, &c., against 319 and 258 in 1875 and 1874. The death-rate calculated on the strength "present" was 1.05 per cent. during 1876, against 1.32,1.06,1.35,1.03 and 1.76 in each of the five preceding years, so that it has fluctuated but very slightly during this period. The proportion of deaths in hospital per cent. of Statistics of mortality.
iv total treated was.74 in 1876 against.94,.74,.93,.92 and 1.05 in the preced- ing quinquennial period. The proportion of the total number of deaths to the total strength was almost the same in the Regular Army and in the Punjab Frontier Force; next in order of mortality came the Madras troops, and then the Central India Force. It will be observed, however, that the death-rates as shewn in Statement No. II have varied very little from year to year, and the low rate of mortality registered for 1876 (1.47 per cent. for the Bengal Army, and 1.23 per cent. of the Madras troops on duty in this Presidency) will doubt- less be accepted as an ample proof of the excellence of the conditions of ser- vice, and of the constant attention paid to the sanitary arrangements of can- tonments, as well as to every question which bears either on the efficiency or general welfare of the Army. Statistics of European officers attach- ed to regi- ments. 9. The average strength of the European officers attached to the Native Army during the past year was 572. From this strength there were 257 admissions and 4 deaths, the former at the rate of 44.93 per cent. and the latter at the rate of.69 per cent. against 47.23 and.51 per cent. respectively in 1875. The principal causes of admissions were fevers, injuries, bowel com- plaints, liver diseases, &c., and the fatal diseases were fevers, heart and liver diseases, &c.

It will be noticed, too, that the rate of admis- sions and daily sick in the Artillery has varied but slightly during the quin- quennial period, of which the ratios have been fully recorded in the preceding statement. The higher rate of admissions observable in the Artillery is very probably due to this branch being located in stations along the North-West Frontier, in which the climate is trying and the duties arduous. Addmissions and daily sick highest in the Artillery. The Infantry comes next in order for the high rate of admissions and daily sick; but is not so very much in excess of the Cavalry in respect of the latter, and this remark holds good for the four preceding years, The expla- nation I offered last year regarding the Cavalry having the lowest rate of admis- sions and daily sick may, I think, be accepted as being generally correct; that explanation was, that the Cavalry soldiers were more healthy from the nature of their duties and from the fact of their being recruited from a better class; while they also were more comfortably circumstanced as regards their dietary and clothing, and on this account are consequently better able to resist the effects of climate. Admissions and daily sick of the Infan- try were lower than in the Artil- lery but high- er than in the Cavaly. It will nevertheless be noticed, that, while there was a marked difference in the proportion of the admissions, though somewhat less so in that of the daily sick, between the three branches of the service, the death-rate varied but little, and, as recorded in the reports of former years, it will be seen that the highest rate of mortality was in the Infantry, then in the Artillery, and lastly in the Cavalry. Little differ- ence in the death-rate of the three arms. STATEMENT No. V. Strength. Death-rate. Hindoos 44,017 1.54 Mussulmans 18,356 1.31 Christians 297 1.68 12.

viii Daily average number of sick. For the sake of comparison, I have given the corresponding statistics for the years 1872, 1873, 1874 and 1875. It will be observed that, as regards the daily average number of sick, the divisional and district commands come in the following order: viz., Lahore, Eastern Frontier, Peshawar, Sirhind, Presi- dency and Punjab Frontier Force; and each one had a daily number of sick higher than the average of the entire Bengal Army, which for the past year was 3.91 per cent. Those having the lowest daily average number of sick were Allahabad, Oudh, Central India, Rawal Pindi, Gwalior, Rohilcund, &c. The Eastern Frontier District has held the first, or second place as regards the average number of sick during the past five years, but the position held by the other commands has varied considerably. Admission- rate. The following divisional and district commands, in order of frequency, shew an admission-rate in excess of that which has been given for the entire Bengal Army: viz., 140.47 per cent.

Deaths per cent. of strength. 1* 1xi 19. Having in the foregoing paragraphs afforded the information which I trust will convey a clear idea of the amount of the sickness and mortality in the Native Army during 1876, and as registered in each of its component bodies,xii vegetables grown in them, would contribute in no small degree towards preserv- ing the health of the sepoys. No excuse now for sepoys being insufficiently clothed, &c. 24. By G. G. O. No. 1 of the 1st of January 1877, Her Majesty's Gov- ernment, on the recommendation of the Government of India, was pleased to sanction additional allowances to the Native soldier, who, by this means, has been placed in comparatively easy circumstances, and should not therefore be permitted in future either to under-feed, or to go about, when off duty, insuffi- ciently clothed. It has been reported on before now to what an extent the parsimonious habits of those men, who either under-feed themselves, make use of food of inferior quality, or do not keep a sufficient supply of private clothing to wear when off duty, have effected their physical efficiency by pre- disposing them to fall the ready victims to scurvy and malarious cachexia, as well as to dysentery and acute diseases of the lungs, from which latter, in the Punjab and North-Western Frontier stations, the mortality has sometimes been at a high rate. I am glad, however, to notice that medical officers, being fully alive to the great importance of these subjects, have bestowed all due attention on them, and, being well supported by the regimental authorities, have been able to report that cases of under-feeding, as observed during 1876, have been exceptionally few, and the mortality from pneumonia, in those sta- tions in which it was considered to be epidemic, if not contagious, has most markedly decreased. The question of under-feed, ing, &c., is still deserving of close attention. 25.However, notwithstanding the boon of additional allowances, which to the miser means increased savings, I hope the great necessity there is for still bestowing close attention to the questions of food and undress clothing will not be lost sight of, as they play an important part in preserving the health and increasing the efficiency of an Army; most markedly so, when the men are engaged on any active service. Benefits of camp life. 26.Several of the reports from regimental medical officers afford strong evidence, confirmatory not only of the experience gained in former years regarding the good results accruing to the health of troops from being under canvas during the cold weather in the Upper Provinces, but, I think, also proving very conclusively that camp life at such a season, conjoined with the exercise, out-door recreations, and other conditions attendant on it, may be considered as probably the best and most reliable restorative for men whose health has been impaired during a previous hot or rainy season, and on this account is a valuable sanitary measure, which should, as often as possible, be turned fully to account. Latrines, &c. 27. It cannot be doubted that the trench system of latrine, which is now coming into general use, is a great sanitary success, and that the dislike of natives to resort to a place of the kind is being gradually overcome. In those stations in which the system was properly worked, the result has been satis- factory in every way. However, it is gathered from the reports of regimental medical officers, that in some stations the Native soldiers still frequent the jungle, or cultivated fields, close to their lines, for necessary purposes. It is to be hoped that the introduction of the trench system, wherever the condi- tions of ground and climate are suitable, will gradually supersede this primi- tive (though extremely popular) custom with natives, which, in most civilised communities, is justly objected to as violating the now generally accepted rules of decency, and that conservancy so necessary to health. Deputy Surgeon- General Ross' report on the sanitary arrangements at the Im- perial As- semblage. 28. In connection with the question of conservancy, I have much pleasure, acting under the suggestion of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, in attaching, as an appendix to this volume, a most full and interesting report from Deputy Surgeon-General Tyrell Ross, of the Saugor Circle, on the medi- cal and sanitary arrangements which were carried out so successfully under his direction in the various Native camps of the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi in December and January last. Mr. Ross was in general sanitary charge of those camps; and the system of conservancy so clearly detailed and organised by him, appears to have been thoroughly effective, and to have been carried out with a singular freedom from offence of any kind. I consider that it is a matter of no small importance to have for guidance, on any future occasion of the kind, such a clearly written narrative of the complete manner in which the general sanitary arrangements of this widely extended camp were planned by Mr. Ross, and so energetically carried out under his super-
xiii intendence, aided most effectively by the officers of the Quartermaster General's and Medical Departments, who were associated with him in the accomplish- ment of the grand object of securing the due conservancy and consequent healthiness of the immense gathering under canvas at Delhi on that occasion. Water-supply. 29. The drinking water used by the sepoys has been generally abundant, and, with few exceptions, of good quality. The great importance of a pure water-supply, and of preserving it from every possible source of defilement, appears to have been generally recognised. Necessity for medical offi- cers to keep up their prac- tical know- ledge of water analysis. 30.From their training in the Army Medical School at Netley, the medi- cal officers of the Indian Medical Department may be considered, on entering the service, to be fully competent to conduct a complete analysis of water; but I should like to know that they keep up their practical knowledge of the subject by being required to render a rough analysis of the water of their "lines," together with a specimen of it, so that the Chemical Examiner to Government might now and then verify the results which they had obtained, An analysis of water, at all events a qualitative one, may be required at any time, more especially on the sudden outbreak of certain diseases, or on the occasion of troops marching or taking the field, &c., &c., and on this account it is very necessary that there should be no probability of a medical officer failing to conduct such an important duty in a complete and trustworthy manner. Bad water in lines of 16th Regiment Madras Na- tive Infantry at Jubbulpore. 31. The water from some of the wells in the lines of the 16th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry, at Jubbulpore was analysed and condemned as unfit for drinking purposes on account of sewage contamination. Yet no bad effects had been observed to result from the use of this water, though not impro- bably, at another season of the year, equal immunity might not have been enjoyed. Drainage. 32. In paragraph 31 of my letter forwarding the Sanitary and Medical Report of the Native Army for 1875, I suggested that it might be worth the outlay to have any one station of known unhealthiness thoroughly drained, as I considered that defective drainage, both surface and subsoil, was accountable to a great extent for the malarial fevers and outbreaks of cholera which are of almost yearly occurrence in this country. With reference to this sugges- tion, the Government of India, in Military Department letter No. 361 of the 7th March last, was pleased to inform me that it was one which should be practically tested, and directed me to submit the name of the station which should be selected to be thoroughly drained, or, if I had any doubt as to the particular station, to submit the names of two or three. Acting on these orders, I issued a circular memorandum (No. 15 of 25th April last) to all the Deputy Surgeons-General of my Department in the Presidency, asking each one " what stations in his circle he considered it would be of the greatest advantage to drain thoroughly, as an experimental measure, with reference to reducing the sickness generally connected with insufficient and imperfect means of drain- age." To this circular I received replies from all circles by the 12th of July, and I record the opinions of the several Deputy Surgeons-General in a sum- marised form as follows:xiv ample room for improvement. He considers there is great facility for undertaking the drainage, as the cantonment lies 52 feet above the valley of the Goomti. Meerut Circle. XV the thorough drainage (surface and subsoil) of our military cantonments would be still more marked in their beneficial influences on. the public health, by caus- ing a great decrease in those malarial diseases and cholera which are very pos- sibly generated by the unwholesome emanations extricated from a wet or damp soil by the action of a powerful sun. Those conditions, which in England are now acknowledged to cause phthisis, rheumatism, &c., will in India not impro- bably cause malarial fevers and cholera 38. Abundant evidence is adduced in the accompanying reports from regi- mental medical officers to prove that considerable inefficiency has been caused during the past year in consequence of the sepoys not wearing boots or shoes of a suitable description. On the present occasion I shall offer no remark under this heading, as the Government of India (in Military Department letter No. 435 S. of the 19th June 1877, with enclosure) informed me that His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, who himself is quite impressed with the importance of this question, has drawn the special attention of commanding officers to it. By this means, there is little doubt but that this important problem, which has hitherto baffled all attempts to solve it, will sooner or later be definitely and satisfactorily disposed of, and that, as a necessary result, the efficiency of the Native Army will become proportionately increased.

The number of admissions into hospital from "blisters of the feet" during 1876, as well as their proportion per cent. of the total admis- sions and strength, is shown in the annexed table. For the sake of comparison, similar sta- tistics of each year, and of the average, of the preceding quinquennial period, are also given. It will be observed that during 1876 "blisters of the feet" caused 2,298 admissions into hospital, or at the rate of 3.03 per cent. of strength, and 4.26 per cent. of the total admissions. These figures contrast unfavourably with the average of the five preceding years. Admission into hospital for "blisters of the feet." 40. I make no apology for re-producing the following extract from the interesting sanitary report of the 41st Regiment Bengal Infantry written by Surgeon J. Lewtas, M.B. He remarks as follows:xvi Malingering. been called on to perform during this period, and that he has been well fed, well cared for, and, as a rule, has been serving in his native country, it may, perhaps, not be going too far to state that, at either of the ages just mentioned, if in good health, he might be considered in his prime as a soldier. There is little doubt but that many sepoys consider Rs. 4 a month, when gained at an early age, to be a sufficient inducement to them to withdraw from military service and settle down in their native villages; but, according to the present rules, if they are strong and in good health, the only means by which they can effect this object is by malingering. The extent to which natives can carry out the practice of under-feeding when they have this object in view is well known, so much so, that to an inexperienced or non-professional person they appear to be in the last stage of some very incurable and wasting disease; whereas they are in reality the willing victims of their own system of semi-starvation, from which, however, they rapidly recover after a few months of pension and home-life. Reasons for proposing a modification of the present invaliding rules. 43. Again, who is there that has served in a Native regiment and has not seen those miserable cases of so-called rheumatism, or rheumatic pains, which seem in their severity and symptoms to be peculiar to the sepoy alone, and to generally attack him some months before the assembling of the Annual Invaliding Committee on the 1st of April ? Some of these are of such apparent severity that the expectant pensioner seems to be unable to turn himself in his bed, much less to get out of it. In others, it may be observed that the patient can only move with difficulty, even when aided by the use of a stick or crutches, or may be his spine or some joint appears to be permanently distorted; but in many of these latter cases no joint lesion whatsoever can be discovered by the most careful manual or ocular examination, while imposition has been detected by putting the patient under the influence of chloroform. The position of the medical officer in regard to such patients is an invidious one; as in the former case, while anxious to avoid doing any injustice to the individual, he may not sufficiently protect the interests of the State; and in the latter, though still doing what he conscientiously considers to be right, the medical officer, remembering the truth contained in the words humanum est errare, may feel that, by reporting a man as a malingerer, he has possibly acted hastily and harshly in being the means of depriving him of the pension for which he had served 15 years. To obviate this, I would propose, on medical grounds, that sepoys should be enlisted for a term of, say, 20 years; that on the expiration of this period, they would, as a matter of right, receive their present rate of pension, or any other that might be determined on; and that the retention of any man in a regiment for further service after he became entitled to pension should be dependent on the opinion of a medical committee as at present assembled. After 20 years' service, the average age of the sepoys should not be more than 42 years, and I think it may be conceded that they should be well capable of performing all the duties of a soldier up to that time of life.* There can be little doubt but that when a sepoy, having completed 15 years' service, has determined to take his pension, he will leave no means untried to effect his object; and, while impressed with this idea, I believe I am correct in stating that he may be considered thoroughly useless for the proper performance of his duties as a soldier. Recruits. 44. The recruits enlisted during the past year, in accordance with the orders conveyed in G. G. O. No. 890 of 1875, appear, wherever they have been reported on, to have been generally a carefully selected lot of young men, and likely to turn out efficient soldiers. Duties of medical officers in connexion with the examination of recruits. 45. In an inspection report of a certain regiment, the Deputy Surgeon- General remarked that he considered a good many of the recruits were of inferior physique, &c. A copy of this portion of the inspection report was at once sent for the information of the Regimental Surgeon, who was at the same time requested to forward an explanation of the circumstances under which * On this point Surgeon (now Surgeon-Major) J. B. White, in his medical and sanitary report of the 42nd Regiment Assam Light Infantry, whilst employed with the left column of the Looshai expeditionary force (vide para- graph 31, page 327 of the Native Army Report for 1872), made the following remarks:xvii such recruits were enlisted. I publish the correspondence connected with this case, and trust it will convince regimental medical officers that the orders conveyed in the G. G. O. just cited, do not relieve them in any degree from the most careful examination of the recruits who join their regiments for enlist- ment, even after being pronounced fit for the service by other medical officers. From the Medical Officer,xviii pneumonia, as compared with 1875, and that it was less than in any one of the four preceding years. Bowel com- plaint.

The past year, however, proves to have been an exceptional one in this respect, but then the rainfall, at all events in the Punjab, was not evenly spread over those months during which it is generally expected to continue. It will be seen in Statement No. X, that cholera formed but.21 per cent. of the total admissions, a very small proportion, but that, as shewn in Statement No. XI, it contributed nearly 16 per cent. of the total mortality, the largest proportion there has been from this disease since 1872. The mortality of the cases treated in hospital was at the rate of 53.98 per cent. Sixteen men who were away from their regiments died from cholera. 50.

This decrease in the mortality, which has been so marked during the three years of 1874, 1875 and 1876, may be fairly attributed to the liberal allowance of purdahs and firewood to all military hospitals in those stations where, during the cold season, an equable and rather high. temperature inside the hospital buildings is such a well-recognised and indispensable adjunct to skilled medical attendance for the successful treatment of all acute or chronic chest diseases. Commands in which chest diseases were most prevalent. 52. Chest diseases were most prevalent in the following military commands in order of frequency, viz.: Peshawar, North-Eastern Frontier, Punjab Frontier, Presidency, Lahore, Rawal pindi and Umballa, and these results agree with those recorded in previous annual reports. There has been a marked decrease in the admissions from pneumonia, and to a slight extent in those from pleuritis and other chest diseases; while there has been an increase in the number of admissions from bronchitis and bronchial affections.

Gohorrhxxi considerable benefit has resulted through their agency, but it nevertheless appears to be highly desirable that the large towns and cities in the imme- diate neighbourhood of all our military contonments, as well as those villages, huts, &c., in which a large number of unregistered prostitutes reside, should be brought under the wholesome surveillance of the Contagious Disease Act. It would seem to be the general opinion, that the soldiers more commonly contract venereal diseases from women who live outside the boundaries of cantonments, and are unregistered, than from those who are duly registered and periodically examined. 54. I would draw attention to the remarks of the medical officer of the 5th Goorkha Regiment at Abbottabad regarding the Eucalyptus, or Australian gum-tree. He considers it possible that the salubrity of Abbottabad, and the immunity which it has of late years enjoyed from severe outbreaks of fever, may be partly due to the introduction of the Eucalyptus which is now growing freely throughout the station. These trees were first planted in 1866, and since then their growth has been so rapid that the medical officer states many of them have already attained the dimensions of forest trees, being upwards of 100 feet in height. The Eucalyptus Globulus, or Australian gum tree. 55. The sanitary reports of some medical officers contain interesting re- marks on various medical and surgical cases which came under their observa- tion and treatment during the past year. While regretting very much that I am unable to reproduce the history of these cases in the present volume, as they bear ample evidence of the interest that regimental surgeons take in their professional duties as well as of the ability and industry with which they perform them, I would again point out that the columns of the Indian Medical Gazette, and of other periodicals, are always open for the publication of inter- esting cases in practice, and are the most fitting places for their discussion and illustration. Reports of in- teresting cases. 56.It has again given me great pleasure to observe that some very import- ant surgical operations, such as laryngotomy, lithotomy, amputations, &c., have been successfully performed by regimental medical officers, who, though military hospitals do not in time of peace afford many such cases to be cured or relieved by operative surgery, will, I feel thoroughly convinced, should the occasion ever arise, prove themselves equal to all emergencies, and be still further desserving of that confidence already reposed in them by their brother- officers and the Government of India. Surgical oper- ations. 57. In conclusion, I may state as my opinion, that the sanitary condition of the Native Army during the past year appears to have been thoroughly satis- factory on the whole, and to have been the subject of careful supervision both by commanding and medical officers. Such a result is due in no small degree to the cordial co-operation displayed on all occasions by commanding officers in carrying out the recommendations of their regimental surgeons. The sanitary condition of the Native Army and hos- pital equip- ment has been very satisfac- tory. The equipment of the hospitals, in all that relates to the comfort and proper treatment of the sick, has been quite sufficient, and no recommendation made with a view to improvement has been overlooked by the Government when brought duly under its notice. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, J. FULLARTON BEATSON, M.D., Surgeon-General, Indian Medical Department.

All the cases were in the left half battalion which had been at Dacca. No special cause can be assigned for them.

The Officer Commanding the regiment has used every endeavour to dispel this miserable feeling, and to make his men understand that even when ill they should not succumb to their feelings in an unmanly way, but should make some effort to combat their sickness; and this on the part of the Commanding Officer has had in a great measure a salutary effect.

A large latrine,to accommodate 32 men, on the dry-earth system, is now in use. It is a pucka building with tiled roof, situated to the east of cantonments. The plan of the latrine is, in my opinion, defective; the seats are a great deal too high, and the gumlahs in use much too large. The inconvenience both to the men and to the sweepers being very considerably greater than if the seats had been made only a few inches high, and the gumlahs proportion- ately small. The ventilation is not bad, but there is room for improvement in this respect. The latrine was constructed years ago, but was for the first time brought into use when this regiment came here. The soil is removed to the municipal pits, and disposed of like that of the city. There appears to be some difficulty in getting ground near cantonments for the purpose of disposing of the soil; but the present arrangement is working very satisfactorily indeed, and a change is not desirable. The establishment consists of four mehters; two bullocks and a cart are kept for removing the soil. Hospital latrine. The hospital latrine, which was in a very filthy condition on the arrival of the troops here in January last, is now worked on the dry-earth system also, the excreta being removed with that from the large latrine. The system is a great improvement on the old one, when the excreta were washed into the river. Only one mehter is employed at the hospital latrine; a second is much wanted at times. Water-supply. VIII. Water-supply. PRESIDENCY DISTRICT. 15 consists of a long room, equal in size to the two ground rooms. The floor is boarded; at either end of it is a small room, one for infectious cases, and the other occupied by the hospital assistants. The ventilation in the wards is regulated by means of large opposite doors pro- vided with glass and venetian shutters, six on either side of the ground floor, and the same number on the first floor. The ventilation is always abundant, and can be regulated as required. The fresh river breeze in the hot season blows directly into the hospital. The superficial area of the large wards is 3,347 square feet, and the cubic space of the same 37,085 cubic feet; or an average of 247 square feet of superficial area and 2,747 cubic feet of space for each patient during the year, which is a very abundant allowance. At no time was the hospital over- crowded. The building is in good repair, and has been recently sand-rubbed and painted. At night the wards are lighted by two lamps. One of these lights being required frequently in the latrine, an extra lamp was asked for, but not sanctioned. XV.

Rheumatism. 7. Chronic rheumatism afforded seven admissions. Syphilis. 8. Primary syphilis gave six admissions only. The men were very free from venereal diseases of all kinds; and, considering that no supervision is exercised over the prostitutes of the town, who are very numerous indeed, it is a fact worthy of mention. There was only one case of secondary syphilis. Nothing need be said of the remaining diseases. Principal cause of mortality. XVII. Principal causes of mortality. 17 ALLAHABAD DIVISION. It appears that the average number of prostitutes borne on the register during the year was 34.33, and the daily average number of them under treat- ment in hospital was 2.26. The area over which the provisions of the C. D. Act are enforced is 24 miles. Examinations are held on the 15th and last days of the month, at the hospital, by the officer in medical charge. There appears to have been an increase in the number of venereal cases amongst the European soldiers during 1876, but it was due, Mr. Cockburn considers, to the amount of clandestine prostitution which was practised by unregistered women living in and about cantonments. Mr. Cockburn made his inspection of this hospital on the 30th of January. Surgeon B. Connolly was in charge. The principal inmates of this hospital are, it is reported, the lascars of the Gun-cap and Cartridge Factories; and their average strength during the year was 1,346.

On the 14th November, the regiment commenced its march to the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi, arriving there on the 21st December 1876, and for the remainder of the year under notice it was encamped close to Budlee-ka-Serai, a distance of about 6 miles from Delhi. Detachments were sent to Calcutta, Benares, and Dinapore, and of these the two latter were relieved once only during the year. Rainfall. The rainfall during 1875 was above the average, and the temperature has not varied very much from that of the previous year.

On the 4th of October the last case was that of a sepoy, who was attacked by cholera in the fort at Allahabad, where he was on guard duty; he died early the following morning in a separate room in the regimental hospital, into which he had been brought in a state of collapse. Thus, the total attacked by cholera between the 5th of May and 4th October inclusive, was 7; of these, five terminated fatally, including two sepoys. The precautions consisted in prohibiting the men from visiting infected localities, separating those attacked, vacating the married quarters and bazar, and fumigating the huts thus left empty. In conclusion, Dr. Odevaine writes: It is interesting to note that the move into camp completely checked the outbreak of cholera, and that a sweeper who closely attended on his confrre whilst suffering from cholera was himself attacked by the disease and died.

On the evening of the 16th February they rejoined head-quarters, having been relieved by detachments of the 35th Native Infantry. On the morning of 18th February the regiment left Cachar for Dinapore, at which latter station it arrived on 20th March. The regiment remained at Dinapore for the rest of the year. A small detachment was sent to Khagoul (three miles off) in the relief season, to guard the rest camp. On 13th October, two companies, A and H, total strength 136, with one European officer, went by rail to Berhampore and remained there for the rest of the year. III.

What these influences are, no one can say; but experience shows that they are frequently met with by rivers; and that native troops travelling on them (i.e ., rivers) often suffer from them more severely as a rule than under any other circumstances." I may be permitted to rejoin, that in this particular instance the most effective influence was contact with an infected body of men. We got cholera from the 35th Native Infantry and not from their boats, for the first case occurred on the 28th in the early morning, before we had started from Cachar. The Sanitary Commissioner, in his letter above quoted, asks," Were the boats attacked the same which furnished cases in both instances ?" Had such been even possible, I should have been very seriously and deservedly to blame. In paragraph III, section 3, of my report above mention- ed, it is written,ALLAHABAD DIVISION. 25 few feet of the gable end of his compartment. On the ground, some four or five feet from this hole, his little girl used to perform the offices of nature, the excreta being removed by the sweeper. When attacked with cholera, this little girl, up to the time she was removed to hospital, passed all the discharges on this spot: being liquid, of course they all soaked into the ground; it is not difficult to imagine that some may have got into the hole alluded to. In this hole, the goorgah and his wife washed their own vessels, and those of the Hindoo sepoys of the Company (D): the men attacked on 6th and 10th August were Hindoo sepoys of D Company. The goorgah's wife was attacked on 11th (admitted on 12th). Is it not possible that some of the cholera poison may have clung to the vessels of these people, and so have been introduced into the body with the food ? I am far from asserting this to have been the case: I only say that the circumstances are suspicious." XIX.

The diminution is thus explained by the Medical Officer in charge: "One of the greatest causes of the diminution of disease, in my opinion, was the enforcement of the rule regarding the non-admission of Europeans into the city; and when this became partly relaxed in January 1877, it was followed by a sharp outburst of disease, which is again subsiding, the rule having been made absolute. If the Europeans are kept out of the city, and the city prostitutes out of cantonments, there will be little disease, provided the cantonment police exercise due vigilance in arresting unregistered women."

The hospital itself occupies the centre of the compound. It is, as well as all the buildings above mentioned, built of large stones, set in mortar, but, unlike the others, has a corrugated iron roof, and the inside walls are plastered with mortar. This building consists of two long wards leading one into the other through a large archway. The northern one is 78'20'13,' and has accommodation for 26 beds. The southern is 72'  20'  13,' with space for 24 beds, making a total of 50. The superficial space allowed for each man is 60 square feet, and the cubic space 810 cubic feet. On either side are doors and glass windows, which run alternately. Over each door is a fan light, and over each window a fixed venetian, directed upwards. I particularly asked that these might be put in, so as to insure on all occasions a free ventilation. The fresh air is always entering (and it matters not if every door and window is shut, as is most frequently the case), but from being first directed against the ceiling, no draught is felt. The ceiling, which also has ventilators in it, is of wood. This subdues the heat, which is given off from the iron. The external surface of the iron is painted a light drab, and therefore does not absorb so much heat as a dark colour would; nor show dirt so readily as white. In the hottest part of the day in the hot season the tempera- ture is very little, if at all, above that of a tiled building; and as soon as the sun sets, the metal gives off its heat very rapidly, and is therefore much cooler at night. On both east and west of the wards are deep verandahs, which keep off the morning and evening sun. At the four corners of the building are small rooms. The two at the northern extremity are fitted as office and dispensary, and the other two as bath-rooms. The floors are all of stone, and are well raised above the ground. Young trees have during the past season been planted round the compound I have omitted to mention that there are two excellent cook-rooms situated between the hospital and the hospital assistants' quarters; but they are never used, as the men prefer having their food cooked in their huts and brought to them.

The above mentioned individuals all lived in one hut in the lines of F.

The hospital staff, who were all in constant attendance, were not attacked. The people who were attacked were the occupants of the hut: no other huts in the lines or their vicinity were affected. The outbreak was purely a local one, and I consider it to have been caused by the extremely dirty state of the court-yard, which was at once thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. XIX.

There was considerable emphy- sematous crackling between the wound of entrance along the course the bullet had pursued, and the spot where it was extracted. I imagined at first that there must be some injury to the chest cavity; this, however, was not the case, but was simply due to the entrance of the air into the cellular tissue through the wound of entrance. The emphysema spread downwards on the left side as far as the pelvis; bandages were tightly applied round the body, and in a few days all signs of it had disappeared. With the exception of an attack of fever which soon yielded to quinine, the case did remarkably well, the wounds soon healed up, and he was discharged well and fit for duty on the 13th of April.

The situation was at the back of the old range, sheltered by trees on one side, and the Delhi Ridge on the other. It would have been difficult to obtain a better site for a camp. The hospital was situated on elevated ground. Straw in sufficient quantity was supplied for the sick and the healthy. The latrines were situated at a convenient distance from the camp, and were watched with great care, The water was taken from a well pointed out by the authorities. The quality was excellent, and it was ample in quantity. The general health of the regiment during the time it was encamped was excellent, and no case of sickness occurred that could be described as due to preventible causes. The detachment at Simla for duty with the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief was located in pucka lines, well ventilated and not over- crowded. They were well looked after, and the general health of the men was excellent. Hospital. XIV.

Life in tents during the healthier season of the year, general exercise, and more constant discipline protect the sepoy against disease even better than the shelter of huts and the mild routine of cantonment duties. The admissions next in number are from blister of the feet. The companies at Roorkee give 130 cases; on the march 39; Peshawar and Cherat 18; Rawal Pindi 13; total 200. It is to be observed that the 3rd company had only one admission during seven months' detached duty at Cherat, though there would be the same duties and extra hours there as elsewhere. It is presumed that the Hindustani shoe was almost entirely worn. On the other hand, the pro- portion of admissions at Roorkee is extremely high, and the conclusion can scarcely be avoided that this was caused by the more frequent and prolonged use of the regulation half-boot. Some allowance may be made for the low condition of health in which those three companies, the 4th, 8th and 9th, who had been 3 years in the Punjab, were in on their return to Roorkee; in them the least irritation, even a common blister, produced a very troublesome sore; and perhaps detached companies get a good deal out of the customary wear of boots, and their feet are apt to gall quickly; but after admitting these explanations, the broad fact remains that a very large proportion of non-effective native soldiers results from a defect of equipment, and some decided improvement in the boot seems urgently called for to make the sepoy reliable either for extra work in garrison life or on active service.

The entire removal of the layer of kunkur which underlies the surface, and constant watering, seem to be the only means which afford a chance of bringing the trees to maturity. Canal irrigation has been carried on as in former years, being only interrupted for about a month in April for the purpose of cleaning out the canal. Rabi, or spring crops, chiefly of wheat, are grown in many parts of the station, with the effect of allaying the heat and dust at the commencement of the hot weather.

It is impossible that the blood can be thoroughly purified, or the veins properly flushed, with water so saturated with soda salts, probably of animal origin, as the well water of Meean Meer. Having been ordered to report upon the use of the mixed cinchona alkaloids, or cinchona febrifuge, manu- factured at Rungbee, I may here state that I have treated most of the cases of fever in hospital during the late season with this remedy; that I have found it a very efficient substitute for quinine, and its employment, in the majority of cases, to be unattended with any unpleasant effects. In some few cases, when given in large doses, the patients complained of feeling of heat, giddiness and temporary intoxication; but these symptoms soon passed off, and were not worse than those sometimes induced by large doses of quinine. When suffering from repeated attacks of fever, natives ask eagerly for some antiperiodic medicine; and in bad seasons the quantity required, to satisfy all applicants, is enormous. If, therefore, this remedy can be supplied in large quantities to native regiments, I think it very desirable that it should be at all events in places where ague is endemic. Twenty-eight recruits and two men transferred from other regiments have been added to the strength of the corps during the year. They are physically a good class of men, and seem likely to turn out well. Govern- ment Order No. 270 of 24th September 1875 has, as far as possible, been acted up to in selecting them.

This will be changed this year for khakee, which, I think, is a mistake; for, owing to the instability of the dye, the men will not wash them often. Native shoes are worn, and I think for marching along roads they are the best for the sepoy; but if any swampy ground is to be got over, the shoes have to be carried or left behind.

Ammunition boots are worn on duty, and, as usual, when worn without socks, produce a considerable number of blisters of the feet. Stout chogahs are worn instead of great-coats. Duty. XI.

But as only one case died from chest disease, and none from bowel complaint, it may be fairly inferred that they were not very severe. The cases of venereal disease were only 15 in the year. On the whole, the admissions have been moderate, especially when it is the practice of the regiment to have no convalescents, and to take even the slightest eases into hospital, and 1876 has been the healthiest year since 1871, as will be seen in the table at the head of this report.

The march was begun about daybreak as far as Jhelum, afterwards not until about 8 o'clock. The regiment halted three days at Gujrat; while there, the Bimher nuddee overflowed its banks during the night and flooded the encamping ground, causing great discomfort. The regiment halted three days at Jhelum, waiting pay, &c. Halted three days at Rawal Pindi owing to rain. Halted two days at Attock owing to the same cause. The men enjoyed very good health during the march; there were no deaths, and nothing of special interest occurred to record. Peshawar was reached on 25th February. XIV.

The number of admissions which took place the 7th Native Infantry during the past year, chiefly from ague, was unusually large, even considering the character of the station and the constitution of the regiment, viz. 2,194. On reference to former reports, I find that native regiments generally suffer most during their first year's service in Peshawar. The 36th Native Infantry had 1,823 admissions into hospital during its first year (1870), and only 998 during the third year. The 29th Punjab Native Infantry had 1,712 admis- sions during its first year (1873) and 1,480 during the third year. Both these regiments occupied the lines of the 7th Native Infantry. In 1870 (first year in Peshawar) the 15th Native Infantry had 1,972 admissions; while in 1872 (last year) there were only 920 ad- missions. Principal causes of sick- ness. XVI.

The average number of continuous nights in bed for the past year has been 5.86. This has been greatly due to the very large proportion of men sick in hospital, entailing heavier duties on the others. The guards in the fort are on duty the whole week without a full night in bed. Marches and service. XIII.

Notwithstanding the occurrence of so many cases of malarious fevers, not one death, I am glad to say, occurred from the disease, due, I believe, to the liberal and immediate administration of quinine, espe- cially in the worst cases. Boils and ulcers were the next more numerous causes of admission, 23 and 18 cases. Bronchitis, when the weather became cold, and usually the result of weak- ness after fever, shows 15 cases. Of the remainder of the cases, there was little to say. XVII. Principal causes of mortality164 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Location and movements. II.

This hospital consists of one large ward in which about 20 patients can be accommodated. The ventilation in it was good, and it was warmed by fires in the cold weather. Attached to the hospital was a bath-room complete in its equipment. There was no special ward for infectious, diseases. The hospital wards were clean and orderly, and all the arrangements (including medicines and instruments) for the proper care and treatment of the sick, were complete and satisfactory.

From the fact that 18 men died out of 24 seizures, we can deduce that the disease must have been of a virulent character. On my joining the regiment, I advised that it should go into camp at some distance from cantonments. This was at once done, and on the 26th of October the regiment camped at Adhuminee and returned into Bunnoo on the 13th of November, not having had a single case during this time, except a syce who remained behind in hospital, and who died in cantonments on the 3rd of November. From what side the cholera entered Bunnoo, it is, I consider, impossible to say; the disease was raging amongst the Wuzeeries, whose hills border on Bunnoo, and who came in large numbers into the place. At the same time Dera Ismail Khan district was infected, and the Sukki and Essakheyl side was suffering severely from it. Any one of these places, or all of them, may have given rise to the Bunnoo disease. XIX. Vaccintiaon .196 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. STATION. PERIOD. Strength.

The average daily sick during the camp came to 5.34, and the proportion of daily sick to strength to 1.87 per 1,000. The encamping ground at Delhi was near Badli-ki-serai, and had an indifferent natural drainage. The soil was impregnated with sulphate of soda, and water was only three feet from the surface. From these causes the ground was damp and cold, especially at night. Had there been rain during the stay of the regiment, there would have been a consider- able increase of sickness due to diseases arising from damp and bad drainage. The drinking water was procured from a well in the Shalimr Garden immediately behind the camp of the regiment. It was good and abundant. The ordinary, or nullah water, near the camp, was impregnated with sulphate of soda, causing diarrh198 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. The total number of admissions came to 706 against 628 of the previous year; the increased admissions in 1876 having been principally due to the malarious fever, which caused 352 admissions in 1876 as compared with 273 cases in 1875. The admissions from pneumonia were less than previous year; three having occurred in the year under report, and six in the former year. Principal causes of mortality. XVII.

Great success has, however, attended the erection of large bunds com- posed of faggots, stones and piles placed opposite the threatened station, and also about three miles above the station, and the river has been directed again into an old channel and its course is now at least five miles from cantonments. The gradual subsidence of the water which commenced in October. leaving a large area of moist banks exposed which have slowly dried up, has exerted little of the deleterious effect upon the health of the men of the regiment which bad been anticipated.

In examining the registers of admissions, I have found that recruits and young soldiers are the greatest sufferers, and that the rate of admissions progressively diminishes in each quinquennial period up to the age of 40, when it again increases. With regard to race influence, I find that the Sikhs give a percentage of admission to strength of 213.56, the Goorkhas 183.23, and the Up-country Ilindustanees, most of whom come from Arrah and Ghazipur, 227.23; the excessive sickness amongst these is perhaps due to the fact that they were at head-quarters during the most unhealthy season. Finally, many of the men are still suffering from the effects of the past season. A very large percentage suffer from enlarged spleens and malarious cachexia. Both invaliding and discharge for physical unfitness is likely to be excessive always at Gauhati. Principal causes of mortality. XVII. Causes of mortality. EASTERN FRONTIER DISTRICT. 215 III.

The minimum number of sick was 11, and this was on the 31st of March. The average daily sick during the year was 33.04. It will be seen that the hospital is scarcely large enough, but otherwise it must be considered a sufficiently comfortable place for sick men. The ventilation of the building is good. The hospital kitchen is a building of grass thatch and bamboo-wat- tle mud-plastered, divided into three compartments. It is situated towards the south about a hundred yards from the hospital verandah; two of these compartments are for the use of the sick Hindu sepoys, and the other for that of sick Mussulman sepoys. The men do not, as a rule, in fine weather feed in these kitchens, and particularly the Hindu sepoy will, when sick, undergo a little starvation in order to get a special sick attendant to cook for him.

APPENDIX. Report on the Medical and Sanitary Arrangements of the Camps of the Delhi Assemblage other than Regimental, by DEPUTY SURGEON GENERAL J. T. C. Ross, F.R.C.S., in General Sanitary Charge. Appointed to the sanitary charge of the Imperial Camps at the Delhi Assemblage of the 1st January 1877, the duties were entered upon on the 14th November. Appointment 2. Earlier in the month information had been received that each Government Adminis- tration and Agency had been requested to depute a medical officer to Delhi, with the necessary appliances for the medical and sanitary charge of the native and civil camps appertaining to their several jurisdictions; and to instruct him to carry out all sanitary arrangements connected with his camp under such directions as might be issued. Instructions had also been issued that no camps were to proceed to Delhi from any place where cholera was, or had been, epidemic, and that in the event of cholera breaking out en route, the camp was to be detained. Preparatory arrangements. 3. On learning the names of the medical officers who were to be in charge of camps240 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Civil officer for wells. 11. An Assistant Commissioner had been put in charge of all the wells of the camps of the Chiefs outside the Imperial Camps. He inspected each of them in the many sites fixed for the native camps, and in their neighbourhood. All were examined and cleaned out when necessary; and here also the good and bad wells were marked; some of the latter being closed altogether. Some of these camps were at a little distance from good water, but there was no actual inconvenience experienced on any site. Latrines, &c., 12. Latrines, Urinals, &c. APPENDIX242 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. Object of report; and results. 33. One object of this report is to show sufficiently in detail the proportion of offices and servants, &c., required for a collection of people of this nature; for no guide could be found and much had to be guessed at. Statements received from the medical officers before their departure recorded generally that the details arranged for were effective in their working; and that the conservancy arrangements, in particular, prevented any offence, with a minimum of trouble. Success in the management. 34. That the management of all was so successful and satisfactory is due to the earnest daily personal attention given by the medical officers to their respective camps, many of whom had hard work: and to the officers attached to the Quartermaster General's Department in charge of camps. In several instances the latter had the arrangement of details until the arrival of the medical officer of the camp. Afterwards they both worked more or less together. A copy of the memoranda attached to this report, Nos. 71, 46, 47 and 48,APPENDIX244 MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT OF THE NATIVE ARMY OF BENGAL. 3. The necessity for latrines in large assemblies should be explained, as probably their use will be new to many. All people should, however, be instructed to use them, except those who, from their position, would have private arrangements, or to whom they would be an actual infringement of personal laws. For people of the latter class a space should be marked out away from the camp, and sweepers told off to clean up at mid-day and bury. If the latrines supplied are not large enough, more seats can be added on application. A female latrine will be required for each of the British camps. 4. Care will have to be taken that the urinals and cartghurs are only used for the pur- poses intended. It is expected that the common domestic covered basket will be provided for each tent in a British camp. A separate store of dry earth has been directed to be placed, under cover, near its main latrine. 5. The Crowley or Sheen patent iron carts will probably be supplied to every British camp; the iron receptacles to the Native camps. Receptacles should, however, be placed to receive the waste from all kitchens: their contents should be removed to the cartghur, where a separate trench might be dug adjoining, and earth used as usual. 6. No mud should be allowed to collect at any kitchen; no drainage should be allowed to stagnate. Where a drain is absolutely required, it should be short, and terminate in a hole, fresh earth being thrown in from time to time to cover all. Bathing water from tents may be sprinkled over the ground, or run into a hole where the soil admits. 7. Convenient places should be fixed on in each camp to which all sweepings and refuse should be brought: no collection should be allowed at any other place. It is useful to fill up holes or hollows with dry refuse; with earth laid over this, new soil is formed ready for culti- vation. The dung of elephants is useful to lay down on sandy or dusty roads. Sweepings and refuse should never be allowed to degenerate into dust. Carts for refuse will be supplied to camps which do not possess their own carriage; and the cartage should take place at stated times. Baggage animals and carts, &c., can also be utilised for the removal of refuse. 8. If animals are slaughtered in camps, a place should be set apart outside their bounda- ries for the purpose. Blood and offal should be collected in earth-lined baskets, or other vehicle, and should not be allowed to soil the ground; all should be quickly buried in a trench as in a latrine. In all these trench operations it may be taken for granted that if flies or birds are seen about, some slackness exists in their management. 9. Arrangements have been made for the supply of all food grains, fuel, and bazar supplies generally; the sale of bad food and liquor should be guarded against; no dirty cover- ing should be permitted over articles of food; and all connected with its sale and transport should be properly managed. 10. Nearly all the wells under the trees of the old cantonments contain bad water; all on the parade ground, with one or two exceptions, have good water. All the good drinking water wells have been colored white; the bad ones red. The same plan has been adopted for the wells in or near the separate camps of the Chiefs. Repairs and additions have been sug- gested to the copings of the wells, and for facilities in drawing water. The drainage round wells should be attended to, neither water nor mud being allowed to collect. The good wells should not be used for bathing, washing clothes or vessels, or watering roads. The watering of horses and other animals may require attention. 11. Crowding of tents, and of the men inside them, should be avoided. The roadways and vicinity of tents should be cleanly swept. The camp site and plan should include places set apart for the different animals; all should be tethered in separate lines; crowding should not occur. The lines should be kept clean, and the litter removed daily. But it is better to remove baggage animals and cavalry entirely away from a standing camp. Poultry should not be kept near the main streets. Local arrangements should be made for the collection of all litter and refuse in appointed places, and for its disposal by sale, burial or burning. Depts of wood, grass, &c., ought to be so placed as to avoid danger from fire. Places should be set apart for cooking, bathing, washing clothes, &c., &c. The general drainage of the camp, and of individual tents, should be particularly attended to. 12. If there is time for the organization, sweepers and their supervisors should be detailed for particular portions of the camp, and made responsible for the good order of their re- spective beats. 13. Each camp will be expected to make its own arrangement for the supervision of all the above details. Supervision should be exercised with activity and intelligence, but it should not assume interference. 14. There are other subjects which may probably occur to medical officers for the benefit, safety and health of their camps; but enough has been said to give a general view. 15. Medical officers can make what hospital arrangements they think would be most suitable for the comfort and convenience of the people composing their camps; shelter should always be provided for troops and followers. Advice might be given to the troops and follow- ers regarding their shelter, clothing, and bedding; they should also be warned to apply early for medical aid. Vigilance should be exerted for the detection of any disease likely to prove epidemic, whether among people or animals. The higher classes might be advised to give notice of the occurrence of any suspicious case among their followers or cattle. On a case of epidemic disease occurring, due arrangements should at once be made to prevent its spreading. If any deaths take place, the disposal of the bodies should be regulated.

A special report should at once be sent to me on the occurrence of any suspicious case or accident. J.T.C.R. No. 46. CAMP, DELHI, 22ND NOVEMBER 1876. 1.

All people in Camp should be enjoined to use the urinals, and not to foul the ground anywhere else, especially at night. 6. Where the position is too conspicuous or exposed for the standard urinal, a hole, dia- meter and depth of two feet, should be dug, and the place surrounded by bushes, &c. It is good to Multiply places for urination so as to prevent the usual native practice of going any where and everywhere. The object is to prevent urine inpregnating the dust which is blown about the camps. J.T.C.R. No. 48 CAMP DELHI, 22ND NOVEMBER 1876. 1. Cartghur.
