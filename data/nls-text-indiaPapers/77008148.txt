Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1933-34. Preface and General Administration. Charge.2 8. In December I inspected twice the working of the newly- constituted Vaccine Depot at Barrackpore and attended personally the vaccination campaigns organised at Kanchrapara by the new Goat Tissue Vaccine Method. I also inspected the hospital at Bankura and discussed with the official Chairman the question of expansion of veterinary aid in this district. 9. In January I opened the Veterinary Dispensary at Jiaganj in Murshidabad and then visited the Agricultural Farm at Manipur in Dacca and suggested measures for the welfare of the livestock of the dairy and breeding section. 10. In February I attended at Delhi the second meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, and also visited the exhibition at Basirhat, which was opened by the Hon'ble Minister in charge of this department. 11. The annual and final examinations of the Bengal Veterinary College were held in March and I acted as President of the Board of Examiners. 12. With the exception of one month during which period he was on leave Rai Sahib Nripendra Nath Majumdar, Assistant Director, held charge of the Western Range, comprising the Presidency, Burdwan and Rajshahi Divisions, throughout the year. He toured for 47 days and travelled 4,528 miles by rail and 91 miles by road. In the course of these tours he visited Rajshahi twice, and Siliguri, Jalpaiguri, Bogra, Dinajpur, Raiganj, Malda, Saidpur, Nilphamari, Rangpur, Alipur Duars, Ranaghat, Kushtia, Khulna, Rampurhat and Suri, once each. Wherever possible he saw the Chairmen of the District Boards and discussed with them the probable means of improv- ing the local veterinary establishments. Besides these he attended the vaccination campaign at Kanchrapara and Serum Simultaneous inoculation campaign at Rajshahi. 13. The Eastern Range comprising the Dacca and Chittagong Divisions, was in charge of the late Maulvi Muhammad Sanowar Chowdhuri, Assistant Director, from the beginning of the year till the 8th May 1933, when he went on leave for three months on account of his serious illness. He died suddenly on the 21st of June last year during the period of his leave. He was an officer of ability, and had put in more than 29 years of approved service in the various stages of his career in this department. Government in the Ministry of Agricul- ture received with regret the report of the death of this officer, and under their direction a letter of condolence was sent to the family of the deceased. 14. Babu Mokshada Prosad Ghose, Veterinary Inspector, held charge of this Range, as Officiating Assistant Director, from the 9th May 1933 till the end of the year under report. He spent 84 days on tour and travelled 2,860 miles by rail, 232 miles by road and 992 miles by boat and steamer. He visited Bajitpur, Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sarishabari, Narayanganj, Barisal, Comilla, Brahmanberia, Cox's Bazar, Rangamati, Faridpur and Rajbari once each, Jamalpur and Joydebpur twice each, Chittagong thrice and Mymensingh five times, during the year, and at all these places he inspected the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries.
3 15. In addition to this work he inspected often the Municipal Hospital, Gowkhana and the Government Veterinary Hospital at head- quarters and supervised the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge. He also visited the Government Agricultural Farm at Manipur several times and attended outbreaks of cattle disease in the jurisdiction of the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at Jamalpur and Mymensingh Sadar. 16. Mr. M. B. Menon continued to work as Veterinary Investiga- tion Officer of this Province during the year. He was out on tour for 233 days and travelled 6,462 miles by rail, and 1,326 miles by road in connection with his duties. 17. The year under review was a very busy year to him and investigations on different diseases were carried out in the districts of 24-Parganas, Nadia, Jessore, Khulna (Satkhira), Pabna (Serajganj), Rajshahi,a Malda, Murshidabad (Nabagram), Rangpur, Darjeeling (Kalimpong), Dacca and Bankura. 18. Anti-rinderpest inoculation formed the main item of his work this year. For some years past I have been desirous of examining new and improved methods of prophylaxis both with regard to their efficacy and practicability in the field. The serum alone method is relatively costly and leaves much to be desired under the limitations restricting its application in India. At first blood virus in conjunction with serum was used in Rajshahi4 under ordinary conditions. The next procedure was to try to use Spleen Tissue Vaccine. Nothing was known of the use of this outside labora- tory experiments. Its efficacy has been established and its cost is approximately 1/50 that of A. R. Serum method. As a result of this work Bengal secures the credit for being the pioneer province to use virus alone inoculation in face of the disease and (2) in the use of Spleen Tissue Vaccine for the control of rinderpest. 21. It was found that this tissue vaccine could be prepared at headquarters, placed in sealed ampoules and kept in cold storage ready for issue to district officers as required. It was demonstrated by that it retained its potency for 30 days in cold storage and for 6 days after issue from cold storage under field conditions. The vaccine was issued to the districts in lieu of serum as quickly as Veterinary Assistant Surgeons could be trained in its use. Some Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were trained directly by Mr. Menon who attended the out- breaks with them. Veterinary Inspectors were also trained in this way and then required to attend outbreaks within their own circles and instruct the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons under them. In this way some twenty-eight thousand animals were protected with tissue vaccine up to the close of the year. The results have been most favourable. In practically all cases outbreaks were promptly checked and there were no cases of disease recurring amongst vaccinated animals. The immunity conferred by this method is of long duration. It is similar to that conferred by goat blood virus which has been personally tested and found to be solid at the end of two years. Part I.5 Equine Diseases. 25. Glanders.6 34. Other contagious diseases.7 Table IV. 42. Table IV shows the number of animals treated and castrated at headquarters and in the mufassal by the Itinerant Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeons in charge of Veterinary Stores. It also includes the work done in the interior by the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in charge of dispensaries. 43. During the year there were 106 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons working in the mufassal of whom 73 were purely Itinerant and 33 in charge of dispensaries, who toured in the interior either at fixed periods ox when necessity arose. In addition to the inoculation and vaccination work noted in paragraph 38 of this report these officers visited 16,068 villages and treated 1,52,673 cases as against 16,587 villages and 1,75,228 cases, respectively, in the preceding year. The decrease in the number of villages visited and cases treated is due to the restrictions imposed on the tours of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons by certain District Boards in this province. Some of these officers also inspected cattle pounds in their jurisdiction, and submitted reports to the local authorities regarding hygienic condition and supply of food and water to the animals impounded. 44. The number of scrub bulls castrated by the staff during the year shows a satisfactory increase, being 3,193 as against 1,945 in the previous year. This will indicate that every opportunity is now being utilised by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to push on with this essential work for cattle improvement, although the number is infinitesimal in view of the numbers yet remaining to be done. Table V.8 50. A Veterinary Dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was under construction at Siliguri during the year. 51. The need for a dog ward in the Veterinary Hospital at Dacca has been felt for many years and a sum of Rs. 1,654 was raised by public subscription for the construction of a suitable building for the purpose. The Divisional Commissioner, Dacca, contributed in this connection, a sum of Rs. 100 from his discretionary grant. Mr. Gossip, the Livestock Expert, Bengal, took an active part in the matter of collection of this sum. 52. The Veterinary Dispensary at Gopalganj was provided with a tube well by the District Board of Faridpur this year. 53. The construction of a Veterinary Dispensary with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge was completed at Satkania by the District Board of Chittagong in February 1934. 54. A dog operation room attached to the Veterinary Hospital at Chittagong was constructed this year by the Dog Show Committee of that station and a sum of Rs. 50 was received as contribution from the Commissioner of the Chittagong Division from his discretionary grant. towards its equipment. 55. The construction of a Veterinary Dispensary with officer's quarters at Hatiya in the district of Noakhali is reported to be in progress. It is also reported that the cultivation of Napier grass in the compound of the Veterinary Hospital at Noakhali is giving satis- factory result. Part III.9 60. All these fairs were visited by the departmental officers who delivered lectures to the people present on veterinary matters, and explained to them the methods of treatment of disease and the manage- ment of cattle. 61. Lantern slides were displayed at the fairs attended by the Propaganda Inspector. Bull Breeding and Rearing Farms. 62. Three such farms were in existence in this province during the year, one at Kalimpong, another at Rangpur and the third at Manipur in Dacca. The first is managed by St. Andrews' Colonial Homes while out of the two which belonged to Government, the one at Rangpur has been closed down as a measure of retrenchment. Table IX, which is intended to show the working of these farms, is left blank, vide the report of the Livestock Expert incorporated in the annual report of the Director of Agriculture, Bengal. 63. Manipur.10 Board now contemplate opening on similar lines a third post for the Munshiganj subdivision and it is understood that a proposal to this effect was submitted through the Collector and the Divisional Com- missioner for the consideration of Government at the close of the financial year. General Remarks. 68. Hormone.11 improved method to be experienced it is essential that district veterinary staff be very greatly increased so that the disease may be reported promptly and no outbreak go unattended. Until such time as there is sufficient staff to attend all outbreaks it is not possible for the depart- ment to undertake protective inoculation when the disease is not prevailing. A proposal for extra headquarters staff has been approved by Government but for financial reasons it has not been possible to give effect to this. A scheme for establishing a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon under local control in each thana area in Bengal has been submitted by me for the consideration of Government. 72.

The students were given training in drill and other physical exercises and regular drill classes were held during the year under report, by the College Gymnasium Instructor. Students were also in attend- ance at the gymnasium under the Gymnasium Instructor and they were examined in physical exercises and three prizes were awarded to the best man of each of the three classes. Hospitals. 32. The number of admissions (patients) during the year was 2,600, making a daily average of patients in the Wards of 149. 33. Out of 5,323 prosecutions under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act during the year under consideration in the Calcutta Police Courts, some 176 animals only were sent to this college infirmary for rest and treatment by the trying Magistrates against 8,040 prosecutions and 229 detentions in hospital during 1932-33. 34. The fees for treatment, etc., were Rs. 20,342 and the cost of feeding Rs. 12,995 against Rs. 12,942 and Rs. 14,104, respectively, of previous year. The cost included the free treatment and upkeep of riding ponies, breeding and draft cattle belonging to the college and the free treatment of patients of poor people. The increase of our income from fees is attributable to some extent to arrear collections of debt from the previous year by the College Manager. 35. There is a well-equipped shoeing forge attached to the college where horses and cattle are shod with ordinary and surgical shoes. 36. The X-ray and Ultra-Violet Ray apparatus of this college were taken considerable advantage of in the diagnosis of obscure cases and treatment. Motor Ambulance. 37. The college ambulance was in frequent demand by the general public of Calcutta and suburbs for sick and injured animals. Fees collected were Rs. 1,020 against Rs. 1,025 of last year. Lands and buildings. 38. Many necessary improvements were made to the lands and build- ings of this college departmentally, but several important schemes are still awaiting completion for lack of funds. 39. My grateful thanks are due to Rai Sahib M. N. Sadhu (Assist- ant Engineer, Public Works Department), for untiring interest in all matters concerning his department in this college. Receipts and expenditure. 40. The main results of receipts and expenditure of the college compiled in my office and preliminarily verified by the Accountant- General, Bengal, are given in Table II of this Report.

A few details of the activities of the section are given below. 3. The following varieties of fodder crops were cultivated by rota- tion in the college compound. The cultivation area was again increased this year as a result of constant demand for the supply of green fodder to the hospitals and also outside:48 8. The faulty drainage as well as there being little or no fall to the land hereabouts, maintained the soil in a water-logged state too far into the cold weather to allow of the winter crops being sown in time to catch the market demands for lucerne, etc., hence our sales were seriously affected, the result being the main production had to be utilised in the hospital. This has happened for the past two or three seasons. 9. Hay was prepared from the following crops and given to hospital patients:49 varieties of fowls were exhibited in the All-India Industrial Agricultural and Art Exhibition for demonstration to the public. 22. Preventive and curative medicines for fowl diseases were sup- plied to the public on application, as well as advice. Rupees 46-3 were realised from the sale proceeds of such medicine. 23. A new section for the treatment of sick birds (pets and fowls) was opened this year and 41 birds were treated realising an income of Rs. 16-8. 24.

51 General Remarks. (a) Owing to the increasing advances of Science, it was decided to approach Government to agree to a complete revision with the incorpora- tion of several new subjects, of the curriculum. Government have accepted and sanctioned the proposals, which were instituted from the beginning of the session. Government also agreed to the alteration of the title of the diploma from "Graduate of the Bengal Veterinary College (G.B.V.C.)" to "Graduate of Veterinary Science (G.V.Sc.)." The importance of this step in the annals of our existence cannot be over-estimated, not only in regard to our individual present status as a Veterinary Institution, or of such to our future prestige, but also to Veterinary Graduates generally throughout India. For it is not, to my mind, too much to say, that the curriculum now being taught in this college will form a basis of the knowledge possible of being imparted in a 3 years' course and likely to be required by Veterinary Graduates for many years to come in this country. Financial improvement only, so far as I can see, can command the amplification of such a course of study, as better prospects in the pay of our graduates might then induce a longer period of training, but at present the changes sanctioned meet adequately the needs of the hour and of the country. The change of title also (from G. B. V. C. to G. V. Sc.) is a fitting expression of what our attitude to-day should be towards Veterinary Science. (6) From the year 1933-34 I as Editor and Messrs. D. K. Sen, S.N. Sinha and K. K. Banerjee as Associate Editors, inaugurated the publica- tion of a quarterly journal from this college entitled "Veterinary Abstract". To broadcast our own knowledge and experiences, and to ventilate those of others to our graduates through the medium of "Veterinary Abstracts" form our chief aim and object in stepping into the breach of a long felt want among our workers. That such a task demands the happy enthusiasm and sacrifice of only the keenest workers is as undoubted as the fact that such work is no mean labour, and I would like to emphasise here that without the help of my asso- ciates this journal could not exist. Owing to financial stringency Government could not see its way to assisting in the printing or support- ing of this publication with funds, hence I have shouldered all such responsibilities myself, being convinced beyond all question of the inestimable value, even necessity of such an issue, not only to our graduates in service, etc., but to the public in general. (c) The Committee of Management was reconstituted by Government during the latter end of the year under report. They held meetings during the year and discussed important matters connected with the college. The committee appreciated in particular the changes in the curriculum and diploma title and also congratulated me on the produc- tion of our journal. (d) The Bengal Veterinary College Accounts Manual was published by Government during the year. (e) The revision of the rules of the college is still under the considera- tion of Government. (f) I with Babu D. K. Sen, Lecturer, was appointed again by the Government of Bihar and Orissa as President and Examiner, respec- tively, of the Board of Examinations of the Bihar and Orissa Veterinary College during the year under report, to which the Government of Bengal agreed.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal for the year 1934-35. Preface and General Administration, I was on leave from 29th March till 20th October. During my absence Khan Sahib S. Ahmed officiated as Director and Mr. A. D MacGregor acted as Veterinary Adviser in addition to his own duties. 2. I toured for 39 days, travelling 4,230 miles by rail, 114 by road and 206 by steamer, visiting Darjeeling, Ghoom, Kalimpong, Khulna, Dacca, Kanchrapara, Delhi and Barrackpore. I attended the Commis- sioners' conference in Darjeeling in support of my proposal for a poll tax on cattle to meet the cost of cattle improvement. The con- ference agreed that the Local Self-Government Act might be amended so that this might be optionally applied by Union Boards, and the money collected should be spent on cattle improvement within the area of the Union Board from which collected. During X'mas holidays I visited Kalimpong and Ghoom with Mr. Ware, Director, Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research, in connection with the diseases pre- vailing there, on both of which the Institute is working for me, Haematuria and Contagious Abortion. At Khulna I made an investiga- tion at the request of the Chairman, District Board, with regard to a breakdown in protection conferred by Goat Tissue Vaccine. This happened in the hot weather and was partly caused by the extreme beat (108.F). But the main cause was that the locality was so remote that the vaccine arrived on the 6th day and was used when it was impotent. Dacca the main object of my visit was to enquire into the diseases among the Government stock and arrange for their in- vestigation by the Veterinary Investigation Officer. I also arranged with the municipality to co-operate with them in the removal of stray dogs, on the lines carried out in Calcutta. On the strength of this the municipality has agreed to contribute Rs. 100 per annum to the Dacca Veterinary Hospital. Kanchrapara was visited to see the result of Goat Tissue Vaccine immunity tests carried out there, and to show them to Mr. Ware, Director, Imperial Institute of Veteri- nary Research, Muktesar, and Colonel Olver, Animal Husbandry Expert to Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. These tests demon- strated the potency of Goat Tissue Vaccine immunity up to 121 months against Bull Virus obtained from the Muktesar Institute. 3. In Delhi I attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of Imperial Council of Agricultural Research but for lack of travelling allowance I was unable to attend the meeting of the Governing Body. I went to Barrackpore frequently to supervise the manufacture of Goat Tissue Vaccine. Owing to shortage of travelling allowance tours without a special object could not be undertaken. Yet they are essential for me to keep in touch with Chairmen of District Boards. 4. Mr. MacGregor.2 148 by road. Khan Sahib S. Ahmed toured for 27 days, travelled 1,620 miles by rail, 46 by road and 206 by river steamer. He visited Asansol, Darjeeling, Ghoom, Kurseong, Kalimpong, Diamond Harbour, Dacca and Mymensingh. 5. Assistant Director, Western Range, Rai Sahib N. N. Majumdar. 3 Agricultural Research. It is only possible to append a precis to this report. (Appendix I). Mr. Menon is one of the most willing workers I have met and is commended for his keen interest and ability in his work. Part 1.4 Foot and mouth disease shows a marked decrease with 377 deaths against 1,101 in the previous year. It should be remembered that the mortality in this disease is low ½ to 2 per cent. of the animals attacked, so that the above figures indicate that roughly some 37,700 animals were affected. Anthrax.5 11. The figures for Rinderpest are of particular interest, notably6 Hospitals and Dispensaries. 18. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the province during the year. The number of in and out-patients treated at these institutions was 98,399 and 26,438 cases were supplied with medicines as against 77,808 and 12,162 cases respectively, in the previous year. The Dacca Municipality have constructed a bullock shed on a new site at Wari, and funds have also been provided by them for the improvement of their cattle slaughter house. Dog Ward was constructed in the compound of the Government Veterinary Hospital at Dacca during the year, the funds being raised by public subscription. The Live-Stock Expert, Mr. Gossip took a great interest and it is due to his efforts that sufficient money, Rs. 1,920, was collected to erect a suitable building. Improvement was effected in the quarters of the Veterinary Assist- ant Surgeon at Mymensingh Sadar. The Veterinary Dispensary at Jamalpur together with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was removed to the District Board's own buildings, after making certain improvements therein. The Dispensary houses at Madaripur and Rajbari have been improved. A shed for outdoor patients and a tube-well were provided in the compound of the Madaripur Veterinary Dispensary during the year. An electric diagnostic 3et, at a cost of Rs. 125 was presented to the Chittagong Veterinary Hospital by Messrs. P. Munday and Petrice, in recognition of the services of Babu M. L. Datta, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge of the hospital. Thanks are due to them for their generous donation, and also to Mrs. E. Nolan of Chittagong for the keen interest taken in the welfare of this hospital. The Kelvinator Cabinet installed at the Chittagong Veterinary Hospital for cold storage of sera and vaccine is giving good service. It is hoped that other District Boards will follow this example wherever electricity is available and install small cabinets so that the supply of vaccine and sera to the interior of the district may be accelerated. The construction of the quarters and dispensary at Hatiya by the District Board of Noakhali was completed during the year. An out house was added to the quarters of the Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of Noakhali, while the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon there was provided with quarters at a rent of Rs. 3 per month. A hospital with quarters for the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was constructed at Siliguri during the year. Funds for this building Rs. 6,000 were provided by the Darjeeling Himalayan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The District Board of Hooghly have enhanced their annual grant of Rs. 100 towards the maintenance of the Veterinary Hospital at Chinsura, while the Commissioner of the Burdwan Division has been good enough to grant a sum of Rs. 100 for the construction of a shed over the operation theatre in the hospital. The District Board of Birbhum have decided to erect a shed for the accommodation of in-patients and to provide proper fencing around
7 the compound. The quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge were also completed during the year. The question of moving of the Veterinary Stores at Alipur to a prominent site in the Baker Road was under the consideration of the District Board of 24-Parganas during the year. The District Board of Dinajpur have fenced the hospital compound and bullock paddock with wire, while the Malda Board have built a brick wall round the compound of the quarters of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Nawabganj. The District Board of Pabna have constructed at Shahazadpur a cattle shed at a cost of Rs. 250 for the treatment of the sick animals there. Part III.8 requisitioned for distribution. The farm has suffered serious losses among both classes of animals from Haematuria which increased very considerably during the year under report. This disease is under investigation. Horse and Pony Stallion. 22. There is no horse or pony stallion in this province. Tables X, XI and XII are therefore blank. Part IV.9 Depot on a permanent basis should be established as early as possible. A scheme for permanent establishment has been submitted to Govern- ment. Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu B. N. Nandy and Babu M. C. Mitra deserve special commendation for their unremitting keen- ness, efficiency and willingness with which they carried on irrespective on Sundays and holidays throughout the year. Veterinary Officers from the following provinces and states visited the Depot for instruction in our methods of production and distribution of vaccine, preparatory to taking up the work in their respective areas 10 3.

B. Menon. During the year under report this officer devoted the majority of his time to the study of Haematuria in cattle; during the first portion of the year, under the direction of Mr. MacGregor, Officiating Veter- inary Adviser. He spent 167 days in Kalimpong where cases of the disease are concentrated in the controlled herd of the St. Andrews Home. He assisted in the investigation carried out by Mr. MacGregor and applied the treatment he recommended. Subsequently he revisited Kalimpong 3 times to report on the results of this treatment repeated, and to apply another line suggested by the work on this disease carried out at the Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research. One of these visits was at X'mas when he accompanied me and the Director of the Imperial Institute, and on the last occasion he accompanied the Officiating Pathologist of the Institute Mr. S. Datta to assist him in carrying out further research work. The investigating officers hold different views as to the etiology of the disease, Mr. MacGregor's being that the cause is a Fluke parasite (Eurytrema species). Mr. Datta's that it is a protozoa, classification not definitely established. Treatment in accordance with both findings has been adopted without success. In the case of Fluke theory this was to be expected as these parasites are most difficult to evict from the body and they can only be dealt with by destroying the secondary host and preventing infection. Both findings were under further study at the close of the year. Strict segregation methods to limit further spread of the disease has been advised. The disease Haematuria is found in hill and mountainous districts and is reported to be common in Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal as well as throughout the Darjeeling district. The local owners limit the spread of disease by slaughtering the affected as soon as possible, to cut their loss, as they know the animal will waste away. On the St. Andrews Homes Farm the cattle were too valuable to deal with in this way, with the result that the affected animals further scattered infection and the incidence of disease in the herd increased at first slowly, then more and more rapidly. There is reason to believe that indigenous hill cattle are more resistent to the progress of the disease than imported cattle and their crosses with hill cattle. But this needs further investigation. It was arranged to carry out further intensive study during 1935-36. The Veterinary Investigation Officer visited the Government Farm at Dacca to investigate White Scour in calves, Filariasis and Bovine Lymphangitis which appeared in enzootic form. White Scour was brought under control. Bovine Lymphangitis was controlled to a great extent by the use of a Special Vaccine, from Imperial Institute of Veterinary Research,
12 Muktesar. This controls the disease in the early stages, but appears to have little effect when the characteristic abscesses have fully developed. Filariasis remains a serious problem. Mr. Menon appears to have discovered the locale of the parent worms namely in the wall of the aorta. From a treatment point of view there seems to be no drug which will destroy the worms without destroying the host. As opportunity occurred, the Veterinary Investigation Officer also investigated the incidence of Tuberculosis and Johne's Disease and Contagious Abortion, Bovine Mastitis and Sterility in controlled herds, also Mange and Ring Worm in calves and discovered of case of "Theileriasis" in cattle and measles in pigs.

Annual Report of the Bengal Veterinary College for the year 1934-35. Preface and General Administration. College.38 6. The detailed origin of the students for the session 1934-35 was as follows:39 11. The Board of Examiners' report to Government was as follows:40 13. As in previous years circulars were issued to all district, local and union boards, co-operative central banks and to other bodies drawing their attention to the utility of veterinary instruction in the Province. 14. Additional Course.41 22. Twelve messes had to be opened according to nationality, and desires of the boarders. These were run efficiently under the direction and guidance of the Manager. The rooms were replenished as necessity arose with furniture, etc. 23. The general conduct and behaviour of the students were satis- factory. 24. The general health of the students was good and no outbreak of infectious or other serious disease occurred. All sick students were properly attended to, and given medicine from the college pharmacy under the directions of the Medical Officer, who was in regular attendance. All complaints of the students were also seen to and remedied. Sports and Gymnasium. Babu N. B. Banerjee was in charge of this section. 25. The Sports Club was re-organised during the year. The per- sonnel of the Athletic Club was the same as last year, viz.42 free treatment and upkeep of riding ponies, breeding and draft catttle belonging to the college and free treatment of patients of poor people. 31. There is a well-equipped shoeing forge attached to the college where horses and cattle are shod with ordinary and surgical shoes. 32. The X-ray and Ultra-Violet Ray apparatus of this college were taken considerable advantage of in the diagnosis of obscure oases and treatment. Motor Ambulance. 33. The college ambulance was in frequent demand by the general public of Calcutta and suburbs for sick and injured animals. Fees collected were Rs. 900 against Rs. 1,020 of last year. The ambulance was out of order during the year, and had to be thoroughly overhauled which took more than a month. Lands and buildings. 34. Many necessary improvements were made to the lands and build- ings of this college departmentally, but several important schemes are still awaiting completion for lack of funds. 35. My grateful thanks are due to Mr. P. C. Neogi (Executive Engineer, Suburban Division), for his untiring interest in all matters coLcerning hie department in this college. Receipts and expenditure. 36. The main results of receipts and expenditure of the college com- piled in my office and preliminarily verified by the Accountant-General, Bengal, are given in Table II of this Report.

Banerjee was in charge of this section in addition to his other duties as College Manager. 2. A few details of the activities of the section are given below. 3. The following varieties of fodder crops were cultivated by rota- tion in the College compound:48 hence our sales were seriously affected, the result being the main produc- tion had to be utilised in the wards. This has happened for the past three or four seasons now from late and heavy rains. 9. Lectures were given by the Manager to final year students on fodder crop growing. 10. Horticulture.49 21.

The popularity of this College which is the only institution in Bengal for the training of veterinary practitioners continued unabated as can be seen from the increasing demand for admission into the College. The number of students on the rolls at the beginning of the session was 203 of whom 170 prolonged their studies throughout the session, the number for Bengal being 66 against 60 in the year 1933-34. The results of the diploma and annual examinations were satisfactory. The Governor acting with the Minister-in-charge is pleased to acknowledge the services rendered by Mr. MacGregor in the adminis- tration of the College and notes with pleasure the names of members of the College staff who did good work during the year. His thanks are also due to the non-official members of the Committee of Manage- ment for the services rendered by them. By order of the Govt. of Bengal (Ministry of Agriculture), H. S. E.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1935-36. Preface and Genera! Administration. P. J. Kerr, Esq., I.V.S., Director and Veterinary Adviser to Government.2 meetings of the Governing Body will normally be defrayed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in view of the fact that at these meetings I represent the Advisory Board, not Bengal. Animal Husbandry Classes.3 subsequently in connection with the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibi- tion, held under the auspices of the Joydebpur Krishimongal Samity. He attended the conference of the Presidents of Union Boards held at Narayanganj, once in August 1935 and again in January 1936, and delivered lectures on veterinary matters in order to impress upon them the urgent necessity for retaining the services of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in village centres of the subdivision. The Dacca Government Veterinary Hospital was visited occasionally during the year and the work of the Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeon in charge was inspected. During the course of his tours he met Divisional Commissioners, District Magistrates, Subdivisional Officers, Circle Officers, Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen and members of District Boards as well as Presidents of Union Boards and discussed with them about the expansion of veterinary work by establishing more Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries in rural areas to render real help to the agriculturists and their live-stock. Touring Of senior Staff.4 Part II5 Rinderpest was widespread throughout the province, except in the districts of Howrah and Dacca, in which the mortality amounted res- pectively to only 89 and 106. The districts of Bakarganj, Noakhali, Chittagong and Burdwan accounted for nearly 60 per cent. (exact proportion 59.2) of the deaths reported under this head in 1935-36. Bakarganj and Noakhali were the worst sufferers in this respect. In the latter months of 1934-35 the incidence of this disease was increasing. It continued to do so through- out the year under report, eventually breaking all past records, for losses reported, outbreaks reported and inoculations performed. A record was also set up in the number of outbreaks promptly controlled by inoculation and the readiness with which cattle owners accepted the new Goat Vaccine method. All the major difficulties of applying this method have been overcome and it was fortunate that in this year of emergency the Groat Tissue Vaccine method of inoculation had been developed to such a degree that it could replace that of serum alone. Out of the 3,69,141 inoculations performed, in only 828 was serum employed. By the Serum Alone method the cost to Government for inoculating this number would have been Rs. 40,000 against Rs. 2,400. Rinderpest tends to occur in a fairly regular rythm with an interval of 8-10 years between each Peak (see chart Appendix). The contributory factor in this present rise appears to be two bad years for cattle in the shape of excessive shortage of food either from drought or flood after which a rise in cattle disease invariably appears. The figures given below show the incidence of rinderpest in 1926-27 the last "Peak" year, 1934-35 and 1935-36. Outbreaks reported. Deaths reported. Inoculations performed. 1926-27 ..

Table IV shows the number of cases treated by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons both at headquarters and on tour in the mufassal during the year. There were this year altogether 109 men at work in the mufassal, of whom 75 were purely Itinerant and 34 in charge of dispensaries who toured periodically or when occasion required. In addition to their other duties these officers visited 18,494 villages and treated 2,37,252 cases as against 17,600 villages and 1,53,780 cases, respectively, in the previous year. The number of scrub bulls castrated by them was 5,045 as against 4,137 in the previous year. The number of cases treated, villages visited and castrations per- formed, all show considerable increase this year, when compared with figures for the previous year. Cultivators are gradually realising the benefit of scientific treatment for their animals. During the year the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Chittagong, Noakhali, Tippera, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Pabna, Bogra, Murshidabad, Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, Howrah and 24-Parganas districts were called together at Dacca, Chitta- gong, Berhampore and Midnapore and received lectures from the Live- stock Expert in the cattle improvement work which would be required of them to help the special live-stock staff in carrying out the rural uplift "Bull Scheme." This is to be given effect in 1936-37. The opportunity was also taken by the Director, Civil Veterinary Department, to (give them a lecture on the new Goat Tissue Vaccine method of inoculation and its application in the field. These classes will be continued in 1936-37. Table V. Table V gives the details of the working of the hospitals and dis- pensaries in this province. The total number of animals treated both as In and Out patients at these hospitals and dispensaries during the year was 1,26,834 and 39,523 cases were supplied with medicines as against 98,399 and 26,438 cases, respectively, in the previous year. The increase is an evidence of the growing popularity of these institutions among the cattle owners. Government Veterinary Hospital, Dacca.8 The District Board of Bakarganj have sanctioned the scheme for the construction of an operation theatre in the compound of the Barisal Veterinary Hospital and the work will be undertaken as soon as possible. It is hoped the Board will soon arrange a cold store cabinet in the Hospital to accelerate the distribution of fresh Goat Tissue Vaccine and Sera also in the district. The success of the Anti-Rinderpest campaign with Goat Tissue Vaccine was greatly appreciated by the local authorities. The Commissioner of the Chittagong Division was pleased to sanc- tion a sum of Rs. 350 from his discretionary grant for the construction of an operation shed in the Chittagong Veterinary Hospital. The District Board of Chittagong have sanctioned the construction of an outpatient shed for the Veterinary Dispensary at Satkania. The District Board of Dinajpur have constructed a regular Veterin- ary Hospital with quarters for the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at Balurghat and a sum of Rs. 5,000 has also been sanctioned by them for the construction of a similar hospital at Thakurgaon next year. A room for two indoor dog patients was constructed in the local hospital by the Burdwan District Board during the year. Jessore.9 Horse and Pony Stallion.

This section will collect up all the contagious disease work of the Province and deal with diagnosis of materials from the field and distribution of all sera and vaccine to district Assistants. The cost of the establishment is estimated at Rs. 14,800. To this has to be added the cost of other sera and vaccine estimated on an average at Rs. 12,000. Subordinate Officers. The names of the following officers are mentioned for exceptionally good work: APPENDIX A. Special Report on Rinderpest. An acute and widespread outbreak calls for special mention. It commenced during the monsoon in the char islands of Noakhali and Barisal in the mouth of the big river, which had been free from rinder- pest for some years. The islands are inaccessible at that time of the year by the ordinary means available to Civil Veterinary staff: country boats. It first came to notice in October when cattle were brought back to the main land of Noakhali where it spread rapidly. All avail- able veterinary staff was sent to control the disease in this area. The District Board engaged additional hands and neighbouring District Boards of Tippera and Chittagong also lent Veterinary Assistants. The Assistant Director, Eastern Range, personally directed the work and the Presidency Circle Veterinary Inspector was sent to make Goat Tissue Vaccine locally in the field. These measures brought the dis- ease under control in about two months but it continued to occur sporadically in fresh places for several months more. While this campaign was in progress the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Patua- khali, discovered that the disease was raging in the islands of Bakar- ganj in a peracute form killing about 80 per cent. of the animals affected. Many died after three or four days' illness. Practically all these animals were buffaloes. Owners fleeing with their buffaloes to the main land to escape the plague carried the disease to Patuakhali. To meet this emergency more staff and special transport arrangements were essential. The Collector, Mr. Tufnell-Barrett, promptly arrang- ed for a big launch to be placed at our disposal. The District Board employed temporary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and Government sanctioned the employment for two months of six extra Veterinary Assistant Surgeons for the emergency. On account of the remoteness of the affected area it was impossible to send Goat Tissue Vaccine from Calcutta for use within its period of potency. The Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Babu B. N. Nandy, employed in vaccine production in the Temporary Vaccine Depot, was sent to make it in the field. The Disease Investigation Officer, Mr. Menon, who was at Muktesar for a refresher course was wired to return. The campaign was in the charge of Veterinary Inspector Babu H. C. Das Gupta of Barisal Circle, the Assistant Director, Eastern Range, being busy in Noakhali district. The Director with the aid of the Vaccine Depot Assistant Babu M. C. Mitra carried on production of vaccine at headquarters for the rest of the province. The outbreak had to be dealt with in sections as the staff available was not large enough to divide up and carry on in all sections simultaneously. The char islands of Kukri- mukri, Kajal, Kalini, Momtaz, Biswas, Shiva and Manika were first dealt with and the disease controlled in three weeks. The prompt action of Mr. Tufnell-Barrett, the Collector, his personal interest and visit to the seat of operations stimulating his own and the Veterinary staff to do their utmost, contributed greatly to the success of this cam- paign. By the end of this period the disease had spread widely in Patuakhali and Bhola subdivisions. For these areas the big launch was of no use. The staff was divided between the two sections and field vaccine prepared in each section. Mr. Menon having arrived took charge of the Bhola area and trained another 2 Veterinary
12 Assistant Surgeons in the field preparation of vaccine. Staff Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeon Nundy returned to headquarters. In these two areas where journeys had to be made on foot or by country boat it took longer to control the outbreak, but it was completed in two months. The whole of the staff employed deserve unstinted praise for the zealous way in which they carried on under difficult conditions. Food and fresh water were difficult to come by and in the early portion of the campaign the all pervading stench of carcasses added to their dis- comfort. Veterinary Inspector Babu H. C. Das Gupta deserves special credit for the manner in which he arranged and directed the work, meeting fresh emergencies as they arose, and controlling the staff. Under such conditions this outbreak which spread over two of the most difficult districts in the province could not have been control- led by the serum alone method of inoculation. It is the most convinc- ing demonstration possible of the efficiency of Goat Tissue Vaccine to control outbreaks of rinderpest, even among highly susceptible buffaloes. Unfortunately after a short interval of time the disease was re- introduced among uninoculated cattle by animals purchased and brought in to replace loss in the Patuakhali subdivision. The protec- tion of the inoculated was solid. This secondary outbreak did not require much extra attention. The District Board retained one Veterinary Assistant Surgeon extra to their cadre. In Noakhali the disease was in the main controlled by the staff under the Assistant Director, Eastern Range, but it continued to be reintroduced among the uninoculated by movement of animals into the Eastern portion of the district from Tippera Hill Tracts and Chittagong Hill Tracts in which the disease was prevailing. The Tippera Raj on being requested to do so employed an additional Veterinary Assistant Surgeon trained in the new method of inoculation and Government sanctioned two temporary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons to deal with the disease in the Chittagong Hill Tracts under the Veterinary Inspector, Chittagong. In Bakarganj and Noakhali, 80,000 inoculations were performed. We have now an effective method to stop outbreaks of rinderpest. A staff sufficient to apply it promptly is required to reduce the enor- mous loss from this disease to a degree that will be of no economic importance. The following officers are specially commended for this work: 13 Extra Reserve Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. (1)Babu P. C. Coondoo. (2)Babu A. C. Chowdhuri. (3)Babu M. S. Chatterjee. (4)Babu U. C.

In Noa- khali district, where the disease again appeared, there were only 824 deaths against 7,669 in the previous year. Foot and Mouth disease.5 Contagious diseases amongst other animals.6 previous year. The figure above includes 10,991 animals castrated during the year under report as against 5,045 in the previous year. This increase in castrations is the result of special instructions to con- centrate on this aspect of cattle improvement in co-operation with the Live-Stock Officers employed under the Cattle Improvement Rural Up- lift Scheme. These figures are in addition to those shown by Live-Stock Expert in his report. The total of 10,991 represents a considerable advance in this work. It is noteworthy as an answer to the old Shib- boleth that Bengal cattle owners are averse to castration. They are certainly not when it is done by the modern bloodless method using the Burdizzo Castrator. Table V. Table V shows the working of the hospitals and dispensaries in the province during the year. The number of in and out patients treated at these institutions was 117,640 and 41,083 cases.were supplied with medicine as against 126,834 and 39,523 cases respectively in the previous year. Besides above figures, 989 animals were castrated at these institutions as against 823 in the previous year. The district of Jessore is to be complimented on the decision to build dispensaries with quarters for the Veterinary Assistants at Jessore and Magura at a cost of Rs. 12,000. The public is greatly indebted to Maulvi Saved Abdur Rauf, Vice-Chairman, District Board, and Maulvi Hafiqui Rahman, M.A., Subdivisional Officer, Magura, for their zeal and ability in carrying this through. Mr. B. K. Sircar, District Magis- trate, Jessore, in support of the scheme promised Rs. 400 as a contri- bution to the Veterinary Hospital Fund. Improvements and additions to veterinary institutions have been made at the following places : 7 Napier grass, etc. 185,000 Napier grass cuttings were distributed in Jessore and Khulna districts. Two hundred thousand cuttings requi- sitioned could not be supplied as stock ran out. Fairs and Shows. Tables XIII and XIV give particulars regarding the fairs and shows held in the province. Most of these were attended by the departmental officers who lec- tured on the care, management and upkeep of cattle and explained to cattle owners the beneficial effect of improving their stock and pro- tecting them from contagious disease. Horse and Pony Stallion. There is no horse or pony stallion in this province. Tables X, XT and XII are therefore blank. Part IV8 issues appropriate sera or vaccine with full instructions to the Veteri- nary Assistant Surgeons. This section now runs as a self-contained unit. Mr. M. B. Menon relinquished his duties as Disease Investigation Officer and took over the section from the 14th July and Staff Assis- tant Babu B. N. Nandy as Assistant Superintendent from the same date. It is due to the zeal and efficiency of these two officers that the section has succeeded beyond my expectations in improving the efficacy of diagnosis and speeding up distribution of sera and vaccine. The production of Goat Tissue Vaccine has proceeded without a hitch, and it has been possible to gauge production with such precision that waste through discard of out-of-date ampoules has been reduced to the mini- mum . Throughout the year Goat Tissuse Vaccine has been supplied to Assam and in the latter portion of the year to Orissa also. The reason these provinces asked to be supplied was that they were unable to manufacture themselves, and in obtaining the product from Muktesar so much of the short viable period was lost in transit (3 to 4 days). Whereas both are within 24 hours post from Calcutta. Assam took 99,200 doses, and Orissa 79,800 doses and sums of Rs. 558 and Rs. 443 are recoverable from them respectively. To obtain this degree of success has meant that both officers have worked overtime, Sundays and holidays included, and neither was absent for leave or sickness. It will not be possible to maintain this standard, nor to make further progress unless the staff originally laid down for this section, and retrenched, be restored, i.e., one clerk and a Section Veterinary Assistant Surgeon. The training of Staff Assist- ants in field production, which is frequently necessary in remote areas, cannot be taken up until the section staff is increased. The work could not have been accomplished this year had not the temporary help been given from time to time by the deputation of Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu M. C. Mitra and an extra clerk occasionally. Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon Babu M. C. Mitra deserves commenda- tion for the excellent work he has done in this section. The temporary depot at Barrackpore made 104,000 doses of Goat Tissue Vaccine during April, May and June prior to the new section being opened. The section made 563,825 doses of Goat Tissue Vaccine and of these 13,200 doses were discarded as out-of-date. In addition the following other sera and vaccines were issued by the section during the 9 months of its existence. Doses. A. R. Class I ... 300 A. R, Class P ... 4,700 H. S.

As in previous years circulars were issued to all district and local boards and to other bodies drawing their attention to the utility of veterinary instruction m the Province and there can be but little doubt that such corres- pondence has been the cause of the increasing number of stipends so kindly granted by the district boards of the Province. 15.

Department of Agriculture and Industries. Veterinary. Calcutta, the 3rd January 1938. RESOLUTION2 In addition to the inoculation performed during the year, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons working in the mufassal visited 20,594 villages and treated 2,17,788 cases as against 18,494 villages visited and 2,37,252 cases treated in the previous year. It is satisfactory to notice that the cattle fairs and shows continued to be attended by the departmental officers who took the opportunity of delivering lectures on veterinary matters and of explaining to the people the modern methods of treatment of diseases and of the care, management and upkeep of cattle. This is essentially necessary for the development of veterinary knowledge among cultivators who are proverbially conservative. During the year the Veterinary Vaccine Section was opened on a permanent basis replacing the temporary vaccine depot. This section is equipped not only to make and supply goat tissue vaccine but has cold storage sufficient to carry a stock of other sera and vaccines for distribution to the districts. Arrangements for carrying out micros- copic, cultural and biological tests also exist in this section. It has taken over the work of examination of slides and specimens from the districts, except for rabies work, and after diagnosis, distributes the appropriate sera or vaccines. It supplied goat tissue vaccine to Assam throughout the year and to Orissa also during the latter part of the year. The thanks of Government are due to Mr. Kerr for the care and altention which he devoted to the administration of the department. Government also notice with pleasure the names of the officers of the Department who did good work during the year. Bengal Veterinary College. Mr. A. D. MacGregor held charge of the office of the Principal, Bangal Veterinary College, during the year. The post of the Vice- Piincipal of the College was vacant till the 11th December 1936 when Captain J. M. Lahiri, M.R.C.V.S., F.Z.S. (London), Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, Bihar Veterinary College, was appointed to the post. This institution continued to maintain its popularity and there was an increasing demand for admission into this college from places in and outside India. The number of students on the roll at the beginning of the session was 194 of whom 10 left during the season and of the remaining 184 students who continued throughout the year only 78 belonged to Bengal, the rest having come from other provinces. The total number of stipends at the college in the year was 58 of which 24 stipends were granted by the district boards of Bengal. It is Gratifying to note that the district boards are responding more and more to the departmental appeal regarding award of stipends to the Students at the college. The results of the diploma and annual exami- nations of the year were satisfactory. Government are pleased to record their appreciation of the work done by Mr. MacGregor. Thanks of Government are also due to the non-official members of the Committee of Management of the College for the kind co-operation and advice which they gave towards improve- ment of the institution. By order of the Governor, H. S. E. STEVENS, Secy. to the Govt, of Bengal.

Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal for the year 1938-39. Preface and General Administration. (1) A. D. MacGregor, Esq., F.R.C.V.S., F.Z.S., I.V.S., Principal, Bengal Veterinary College, acted as Veterinary Adviser to the Gov- ernment of Bengal throughout the year, while Mr. P. J. Kerr was recalled from leave in the United Kingdom and his services were placed at the disposal of the Central Government as Animal Husbandry Commissioner. Rai Sahib M. P. Ghosh held charge of the Civil Veterinary Department till the 9th of November 1938, when he proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement. He toured about in Dacca, Mymensingh, Comilla, Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, Khulna, Barisal, Burdwan, Noakhali and 24-Parganas districts, inspected five hospitals and fourteen dispensaries, travelled 2,320 miles by rail, 836 miles by steamer and 399 by road. He was out in the mofussil for 83 days during 1938-39. Mr. S. M. Ali, B.SC, M.R.C.V.S., succeeded the Rai Saheb about the second week of November last and was in office until the close of the year under review. He was engaged in Government itinerary for 72 days chiefly in East Bengal which was a hot-bed of cattle disease, visited six hospitals and eleven dispensaries, two villages and a number of stations affected with epidemics and endemics, and covered 4,702 miles by road, rail and steamer. He inspected the Goat Virus Vaccine Centre at Chittagong during January 1939. He was a member of the All-India Cattle Show Society as a representative from Bengal and attended the Cattle Show organised by the Society at Delhi during February 1939. (2) One post of Deputy Director and one new post of Assistant Director were created and filled up by Mr. S. M. Ali, B.SC, M.R.C.V.S., (before his appointment as Director) and Mr. H. C. Das Gupta, respectively. Captain J. M. Lahiri, Vice-Principal, Bengal Veteri- nary College, who was on deputation to the department from the 1st of July 1938, succeeded Mr. Ali as Deputy Director when the latter was appointed Director. He was on tour for 63 days and inspected five hospitals and sixteen dispensaries. A new Range called the Northern Range was constituted in October 1938 with Jalpaiguri as its headquarters and the districts of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Bogra and Malda of the old Western Range were apportioned to that Range the remaining districts of the Western Range having forming the new South-Western Division with headquarters in Calcutta. Mr. Balwant Singh continued his research activities as the Disease Investigation Officer, Bengal. He investigated several problems of interest relating to Contagious Abortion, Verminous Pneumonia, Tuber- culosis, Johne's Disease, Rinderpest, Hump-Sore and affections common amongst poultry. His endeavours to determine the cause of ineffec- tiveness and variability of Goat Tissue Vaccine in certain areas of Bakarganj district and the susceptibility of Murrah buffaloes to this system of Rinderpest immunisation are commendable. A resume of his work is annexed at Appendix A.
2 Part I.3 good result as a preventive amongst ponies in. the heavily infected stables. Glanders.4 Haemorrhagio Septicaemia.-5 Poultry diseases. The Assistant Director, South Western Range, reported Ranikhet disease from Murshidabad and Hooghly with losses of 358 birds. Fowl Cholera, Diphtheria, and other fowl plagues were not so common. Epizootics of disease in the poultry industry continued to involve heavy monetary loss which has been augmented enormously on some farms or in villages where unscientific methods of management are in vogue. But it is pleasing to note that there has been an increased tendency on the part of poultry breeders in general to seek veterinary advice and in many cases severe loss has been prevented. Preventive inoculations. Reference has already been made to the protection of cattle with Sera and Vaccines under various disease heads and it is not necessary to put further the statistical details. The entire operations of the staff may, however, be abridged as under: 6 performed against 12,534 the reduction is attributable to the fact that these operations now constitute a major item of the activities of the Livestock Department and were undertaken by them on a larger scale. Tables IV and V.7 Establishment. Besides the recruitment of the Deputy Director who assumed charge of his duties on the 25th of July 1938, the appointment of the three Assistant Directors Messrs. H. C. Das Gupta, Golam Rahman, and P. C. Banerjee who joined at Jalpaiguri in the Northern Range, Dacca in the Eastern Range, and Calcutta in the South-Western Range on the 21st March 1938, 28th November 1938 and 3rd January 1939, respectively, and the posting of M. C. Mitra as Assistant Superintendent, Veterinary Vaccine Sub-section, Chittagong, there were no material changes in the strength and personnel of the establishment of the department. The full cadre of the staff employed is evident from Table VII and may be summarised as shown below: 8 The section also issued sera and other vaccines to the field staff and undertook the examinations of pathological specimens including blood smears, urine, fæces, scrapings, growths, etc., for diagnosis of diseases. The data of these examinations may be abbreviated as under: 9 local executive officers in general and the Commissioners and Collectors in particular took a very keen interest in the control of cattle diseases. It would also be unfair not to acknowledge the services of the veterinary staff as a whole for their enthusiastic contributions and willingness to shoulder additional burdens in attempts to present a healthier season. The assistance rendered by the Chairmen of the various local bodies in matters concerning the work of the department and the general welfare of the live-stock has been commendable and must be gratefully acknowledged. A mention must also be made of the good work done by the office staff of the Civil Veterinary Department who rendered valuable assis- tance throughout the year. In conclusion, the department owes its grateful thanks to Mr. A. D. MacGregor, Veterinary Adviser to Government, for his guidance and advice for his indefatigable labour in promoting the activities of the department. S. M.

47 Museum and Library. Babu Nani Gopal Mukherjee, G.B.V.C, was in charge of these two sections during the year. 12. Museum.48 Physiological Section. 18. Classes were held as usual during the year. Charts and diagrams were prepared and demonstrated to make the students thoroughly conversant in the above subject, particular stress being laid on those aspects of applied physiological processes pertinent to the course. Anatomy Section. 19. In the Senior Anatomy classes, bodies were preserved for dissection and demonstration purposes as in previous years. For the Junior Anatomy classes held during the year new sets of bones and skeletons were prepared and demonstrated to the students as in previous years. Bones were also prepared and distributed freely; this practice is of considerable value. Milk Laboratory. 20. The laboratory which is equipped with up-to-date instru- ments and appliances was as usual utilised by the senior students in gaining practical lessons and demonstrations in the technique of examination of milk and milk products. This section constitutes an important addition to our Final Year's Course in Animal Husbandry and although in its infancy still should form eventually the basis of the extra year's course of training contemplated in Animal Husbandry for inauguration of the "Bengal Dairy Diploma" Course. 21. A scheme for starting a well-equipped dairy on modern lines with a herd of 20 cows together with machinery and appliances for urban milk supply, is also under the consideration of Government. With its sanction, the long-felt want of practical demonstration will he solved. Hostels. 22. The Manager was in charge of the hostels. Two hundred and four boarders were resident in Sir Andrew Fraser and Macpherson hostels of this College. 23. Fourteen messes were opened according to nationality and desire of the boarders. The rooms were replenished as necessity arose with necessary furniture, etc. 24. The general conduct and behaviour of the students were satisfactory. 25. The general health of the students throughout the year was good on the whole, there being no epidemics or serious illness of any kind. All sick students were properly attended to and given necessary medical aid by the College Medical Officer who was regular in his attendance. Serious cases, when they do occur, requiring close nursing, are admitted to the local hospital as also are those of a contagious nature.
49 Sports and Gymnasium. Babu N. B. Banerjee was in charge of this section. 26. The personnel of the Athletic Club was as follows : 50 Motor Ambulance. 33. The College ambulance was in demand by the general public of Calcutta and suburbs for sick and injured animals. Fees collected were Rs. 1,189 against Rs. 540 of last year. Lands and buildings. 34. Although great improvements have been made in the College in regard to the above, there are still several important schemes await- ing completion for lack of funds. A new though small block to the office building was erected during the year for accommodation of additional clerks sanctioned by Government and of office records. 35. The College is indebted to Mr. J. C. Guha, B.SC, B.E. (Execu- tive Engineer, Suburban Division), for his untiring interest in all matters concerning his department in the College. At the request of the Executive Engineer, Western Electrical Division, his Overseer in charge of electric installations in the College were furnished with two rooms in the menials quarters in this College for holding his office and for storage of materials. Receipts and Expenditure. 36. The main results of receipts and expenditure of the College compiled in my office and preliminarily verified by the Accountant- General, Bengal, are given in Table II of this report.
Raymond Research Laboratory. The Principal held charge of the Laboratory in addition to his other duties. The Laboratory Assistant worked under him during the year. 2. The Disease Investigation Officer, Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, took full advantage of this Laboratory and also held his office here almost throughout the year under the direction of the Principal, Bengal Veterinary College and Veterinary Adviser to the Government of Bengal. 3. One of the Bengali graduates of this College of the year 1937-38 attended the practical extension course in this College sanctioned by Government till he secured an appointment in the Allahabad Agricul- ture Institute. 4. Classes were held in the laboratory and practical demonstrations in laboratory methods and technique were as usual given to the senior students. Lantern slides and pathological specimens were also shown to such students. 5. Rabies.52 unit doses of blackquarter serum, 1,550 unit doses of blackquarter vaccine, and 137 unit doses of mallein, were issued from the stock at the Raymond Research Laboratory of this College during the year. 11.

GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. The history of this report starts from the "Partition of Bengal". Prior to the partition of the province the head of the Department was the Director, having under him the Deputy Director. Both these posts were manned by Muslim officers who after partition opted to work in East Bengal. After the partition the posts of Director and Deputy Director were abolished and the Department was placed under the Director of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. To assist the Director, Sri P. C. Banerji was appointed as the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal. Since then the administration of the Department has been entrusted with him under the guidance and instructions of the Director of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. Under this new arrange- ment the Department was named "Veterinary Field Section". At the time of partition of the province the share of the staff that fell to West Bengal consisted of only 8 Veterinary Inspectors and 73 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons against a sanctioned cadre of 19 Veterinary Inspectors and 110 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. Altogether 91 officers opted to serve in West Bengal from East Bengal. Six Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were also reverted from military service to their posts in this province with option to serve the West Bengal Government. With the existing staff and those that came over from East Bengal and military service on reversion, a cadre of 90 Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, 24 Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, 28 District Veterinary Officers, 15 Emer- gency and Mass Inoculation Staff, 6 Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 13 Leave Reserves was contemplated. But all the posts could not be filled up for want of personnel. Two range offices in West Bengal after partition were divided into 3 ranges, viz., the Eastern, the Western and the Northern, with their headquarters at Calcutta, Midnapore and Jalpaiguri. An officer of the rank of Bengal Veterinary Service was placed in charge of each range. A post of Superintendent, Headquarters, was also created to assist the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services in his work. The changes in the designation of officers existing before partition had to be made in conformity with similar posts existing in the Directorate of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. During the period under review Assistant Director spent 18 days on tour covering 2,136 miles by rail and 132 miles by road. The Assistant Director of Veterinary Services was elected a Member of the Advisory Board of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, and of the Animal Diseases and Pests Committee within this period. Sri C. C. Das Gupta carried on the duties of Superintendent, Head- quarters, throughout the period in addition to his own duties as District Veterinary Officer, Emergency Section. Sri J. C. Majumdar held charge of the post of Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Eastern Range, with headquarters at Calcutta. This range comprised the districts of 24- Parganas, Howrah-Hooghly, Nadia and Murshidabad. Sri G. S. Banerjee held charge of the post of Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Western Range, with headquarters at Midnapore. This range comprised the districts of Midnapore North, Midnapore South, Bankura, Burdwan
2 and Birbhum. Sri G. S. Banerjee held charge of the post of Superin- tendent of Veterinary Services, Northern Range, from 15th August to 31st October 1947, after which he made over charge to Sri S. D. Gowloog to join the newly started range at Midnapore as Superintendent of Veteri- nary Services. Sri S. D. Gowloog continued to hold charge of the post of Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Northern Range, Jalpaiguri, during the remaining period. This range comprised the dis- tricts of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, West Dinajpur and Malda, also Cooch Behar State where services of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons are lent on Foreign Service. The Disease Investigation Sections are hitherto attached to Field Sec- tion although it is proposed to place these Sections under Education, but pending issue of orders of Government in that respect they are attached to Field Section. The Disease Investigation Section comprises mainly of four branches, viz., (1) Investigation into Bovine and Equine Diseases, (2) Diseases of Poultry, (3) Diseases of Sheep and Goats, and (4) Helminthic Diseases. (1) Sri R. N. Mohan held the post of Disease Investigation Officer for the period under report. (2) Sri S. K. Bhadury held the post of Assistant Disease Investigation Officer, Poultry. (3) and (4) There was neither any officer for Investigation of Diseases of Sheep and Goats nor of Helminthic Diseases during the period under report. It may, however, be added that Sri B. Chowdhury has been sent up as a State Scholar to study Sheep and Goat Diseases and their Rearing in Texas College in U.S.A., and an officer for investigation of Helminthic Diseases has very recently been appointed. Summary of the work done by the Disease Investigation Officer and Assistant Disease Investigation Officer, Poultry, is appended to the report as Annexures I and II. PROPAGANDA WORK. Before partition, this Department was fortunate to have a fairly work- able Propaganda Section to carry on propaganda on veterinary matters in the province. After partition, however, the best implements of the Section were taken away to Pakistan, thus rendering propaganda difficult. A very good use of the few implements that were left behind, was made by Sri B. K. Gupta, District Veterinary Officer of Propaganda Work, and the Section was run successfully. This was evident from the very in- structive show the Propaganda Section gave in the last All-India Exhibition held in Calcutta in February 1948. The officer was on tour for 95 days, visited 45 villages and conducted 10 magic lantern shows during the period under report. He attended 9 exhibitions besides the All-India Exhibition held at Calcutta, at Berhampore, Burdwan, Calcutta, 24- Parganas, Birbhum and Hooghly. Before partition this Department had a portable 16m.m. cinema machine with a dynamo and all outfits. There were three magic lanterns and sufficient number of slides, models and instructive charts, pictorial posters and printed bulletins for work. After partition only two magic lanterns were left, of which one being electrically workable, is unsuitable for work in the rural areas. The charts, posters and bulletins were all divided, leaving only a ghastly mutilated Section for West Bengal. This Department contemplates to submit scheme to Government very shortly for expansion of this Section.
3 TREATMENT OF DISEASES. Contagious Diseases.4 Mass vaccination.5 DISEASE OF POULTRY AND OTHER DOMESTICATED BIRDS. A separate Poultry Disease Section has been opened manned by an Officer of the District Veterinary Officers grade and assisted by 3 Field Assistants. The officer was on tour for 67 days, travelled 2,518 miles by rail, 530 miles by road and visited Midnapore Poultry Multiplication Centre, Contai, Berhampore, Jalpaiguri, Birbhum, Burdwan and Ranaghat Poultry Multi- plication Centres. He handled 14 outbreaks of fowl diseases of which 5 were due to Ranikhet Disease and 5 to Fowl Pox, and the remaining 4 were due to Fowl Cholera and Coccidiosis. In Ranikhet, Fowl Pox and Fowl Cholera as many as 284, 820 and 129 birds were respectively affected and 253, 682 and 117 died. 4,404, 1,388 and 162 birds were respectively protected against Ranikhet Disease, Fowl Pox and Fowl Cholera with appropriate vaccines. The Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry) carried out spe- cialised investigation in several specific cases of helminthic poultry diseases not ordinarily met with among poultry. Such diseases occurred in sporadic form in Ghoom in Darjeeling district and in Diamond Harbour in 24- Parganas district. A perusal of the annual report of this officer will throw light on the matter (vide Annexure II). TREATMENT OF CONTAGIOUS AND NON-CONTAGIOUS DISEASES BY ITINERANT STAFF ON TOUR (TABLE IV). The itinerant staff visited 8,528 villages in course of their tours in mofussil and treated 43,545 head of cattle for non-contagious diseases and 22,674 head for contagious diseases. They castrated 425 animals in co- operation with the staff of the Livestock Department. Unlike previous years the Itinerant Veterinary Assistant Surgeons have been furnished with a stock of common drugs for the treatment of cattle of the agriculturists for ordinary sickness, wounds and accidents free of cost in course of their tours. Though this does not in any way do away with the idea of estab- lishing small treatment centres in the rural areas, but until such is established and sufficient qualified Veterinary Graduates are available, the system adopted will go a great way to help the agriculturists. HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES (TABLE V). Only 24 Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries are operating in the province under same number of Stationary Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. These institutions are practically under dual control of the Government and the Boards. The condition of these institutions is far from satisfactory. These institutions are mostly in highly dilapidated conditions and lack in the commonest medicines. The work done by these existing institutions will be found in Table V. To summarise the following is stated : 6 Development Projects.-In undivided Bengal the Directorate had as many as six schemes (including one pertaining to the Bengal Veterinary College). It is now pursuing in divided Bengal only one scheme, viz., better facilities of veterinary aid in Calcutta and suburbs. One hospital at Broad Street is functioning. Efforts are being made to start two other hospitals at Behala and Howrah. The expenditure on the scheme for the period under report was Rs. 2,678. The hospital has been rendering- good service to the locality wherein it is situated. 2,792 out-patients and 148 in-patients have been treated in the hospital. An artificial insemination centre has been opened in the Broad Street hospital under the Government of India scheme and 37 cows have been inseminated. BREEDING OPERATIONS. As in previous years Breeding Operations and other matters relating to the improvement of livestock were under the control of the Livestock Section of the Directorate. The officers of the Civil Veterinary Department always rendered co-operation and assistance to the officers of the Livestock Department in the discharge of their functions. FAIRS AND SHOWS. Fairs and shows are shown in Tables XIII and XIV. There were one horse fair and two cattle fairs in West Bengal during the period under report. Departmental officers of the ranks of District Veterinary Officers and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons delivered lectures of educative and instruc- tive value in these fairs. Veterinary bulletins were also freely distributed as far as was available. ESTABLISHMENT. An inkling into the staff working under the Field Section has been given under head "General Administration" of this report. Detailed below is a statement showing the full staff working in the Field Section during the period under report :7 EPIZOOTIC DISEASES IN CALCUTTA AND SUBURBS. This section was attached to the Field Section during the period under report and was under the direct control of the Assistant Director (Veteri- nary), West Bengal. The staff consisted of seven Inspectors of the District Veterinary Officer's grade including one Chief Glanders Inspector. One Head Constable and 7 Constables of the Calcutta Police are perma- nently attached to this Section to help them in the seizure of cases under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Before partition all the Inspectors of this Section were Muslims except the Chief Glanders Inspector. They all opted for East Bengal. So far some time after partition, i.e., up to December 1947, all the vacancies could not be filled up and the Section had to work short-handed. The area of work of this Section is the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Corporation and 14 other municipalities around Calcutta, viz., (1) Bara- nagore, (2) Panihati, (3) Kamarhati, (4) Titagarh, (5) Khardaha, (6) North Barrackpore, (7) South Barrackpore, (8) Dum Dum, (9) North Dum Dum, (10) South Dum Dum, (11) South Suburban (Behala), (12) Garden Reach, (13) Tollygunj and (14) Howrah. Within this area they are not only to detect cases of Glanders, Farcy, Surra and other epizootic diseases among the equines, but also to deal with all outbreaks of contagious diseases among the bovines. In this latter function they were assisted by the Field Assistants to help them in carrying out prophylactic treatment. For facility of work and quick transport of staff with requisite medicines and instruments to the seat of work this Section was provided with a jeep and an ambulance. After partition the jeep was taken away (by the Director of Veterinary Services, East Bengal, and the ambulance was left in an unserviceable condition. The staff of this Section as a general routine made periodical inspec- tions of 90 stables and hackney carriage stands and thus they inspected 1,226 horses for detection of cases of epizootics in the equines. But fortunately no cases were reported. They inspected 26,251 cattle in 996 byres including the gowkhanas of the Calcutta Corporation and other suburban municipalities lying within the Glanders areas. They inspected the cattle markets at Kidderpore, Goabagan, Chitpore, Dum Dum, etc., to enquire into the prevalence of contagious diseases and instructed people in scientific care and management of their livestock. Besides giving in- oculations against contagious diseases at the request of owners, they attended 71 outbreaks of Rinderpest, one outbreack of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and one outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease. They inoculated 6,423 against Rinderpest by Sero Vaccine Method, 55 head of cattle against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and treated 10 head of cattle for Foot and Mouth Disease. VACCINE MANUFACTURE. Vaccines and Sera for Equines and Bovines.8 The Bengal Veterinary Research Institute at Belgachia with its sub- section at Kurseong manufactured all Groat Tissue Vaccine which was consumed in West Bengal and sold to Assam and East Punjab Governments in the period under report. Before partition of the province the Bengal Veterinary Research Institute had four Sub-sections at Kurseong, Dacca, Barisal and Chittagong. After partition the Sub-sections at Dacca, Barisal and Chitagong fell to East Bengal. At the time of partiton the Bengal Veterinary Research Institute suffered losses due to its big refrigera- tor being sabotaged along with the seed virus. To revive the work of manu- facture of Goat Tissue Vaccine after partition fresh virus had to be indented from Mukteswar and thus manufacture of Goat Tissue Vaccine was stopped for some time. In fact manufacture of Goat Tissue Vaccine in the Bengal Veterinary Research Institute was at a standstill from 15th July 1947, for unsettled conditions and non-availability of suitable type of goats and for booking restrictions from outside the province. The difficulties were, however, overcome and manufacture was started from middle of September 1947. In the meantime the Sub-section at Kurseong maintained the required supply for West Bengal; but it also supplied Assam and East Punjab Governments, though not to the full demand. Supply to East Punjab was made by avian route. During the period under report 4,820 ampoules (moist) containing 773,100 doses and 1,758 ampoules (dessicated) containing 329,000 doses of Goat Tissue Vaccine were manufactured in the Institute and the Sub- section. Out of this 1,257 ampoules equivalent to 248,000 doses and 170 ampoules equivalent to 34,000 doses were sold to Assam and East Punjab respectively. The rest, viz., 5,151 ampoules equivalent to 888,100 doses, were consumed in the province. The sale-proceeds from Goat Tissue Vaccine amounted to Rs. 2,224-4. Total unclassified receipts from Mukteswar products amounted to Rs. 458-7. Besides the manufacture of Goat Tissue Vaccine and distribution of other biological products within the province, the Bengal Vaterinary Research Institute received specimens numbering 41 for bacteriological, pathological and parasitological examinations of which 21 proved positive. Kachin Camp, Kurseong.9 CONCLUSION. In concluding this report it will not be out of place to mention here the fact that in spite of the handicaps the Directorate faced after partition in the form of lack of personnel, adequate and proper implements and removal of important and valuable records, a gigantic effort has been made to carry on and reorganise the Department as best as possible and it is needless to say that officers and staff will persevere to keep up the standard. In the colossal task of reorganising the Directorate, the Assistant Director takes this opportunity to put on record his thanks to the follow- ing staff :Annexure I VETERINARY INVESTIGATION OFFICER, WEST BENGAL.

Augmenting milk production by injecting æstrogenic hormones, iodinated protein, etc.12 All treated animals remained in good health and showed distinct improvement in condition, some even putting on considerable amount of fat. All showed copious but clear mucoid discharge at the vulva, which persisted for some weeks after the injections were over. Many were inclin- ed to stand with an arched back and in some the tail heads rose distinctly. There were no mishaps. 4. Avitaminosis A in Calves.Annexure II Scheme for the Investigation of Poultry Diseases in West Bengal. PART I.14 Prophylactic vaccination will be undertaken and its reaction and period of immunity, etc., will be recorded. The disease will also be studied in a "control" village without adopting any preventive inoculation but depending entirely on sanitary measures. 4. Tuberculosis in fowls.15 (d) Reports of pasteurellosis in saras birds (Antigonea Antigone) in Calcutta Zoo was duly controlled with fowl cholera serum and vaccine given simultaneously at the rate of 5 c.c. and 1 c.c. respectively per bird, after the disease was diagnosed in the presence of typical P.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Government of West Bengal Home (Publicity) Department Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, West Bengal College and Hospital For the Year 1948-49 Superintendent, Government Printing West Bengal Government Press, Alipore, West Bengal 1952 PriceAnnual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department West Bengal, for the year 1948-49 General Administration. Sri P. C. Banerji, Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, was in direct charge of the "Veterinary Field Section" of the department throughout the year under report under the Director of Agri- culture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, West Bengal. During the period under review the Assistant Director had been on tour for 63 days covering 8,306 miles by rail and 368 miles by road. The Assistant Director of Veterinary Services was an elected member of the Advisory Board of the Indian Council of the Agricultural Research, New Delhi, and of the Animal Diseases and Pests Committee and the Animal Nutrition Committee within the period under report. He attended the Animal Diseases and Pests Committee and Advisory Board meetings of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research at Delhi and meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board at Mysore. He was also a member of the Managing Committee of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Calcutta, and Bengal Veterinary College, Belgachia. To assist in the work of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services both in the general and the technical sides of administration Sri C. C. Das Gupta held charge of the post of Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Headquarters, throughout the year under report. In addition to his own duties he also held charge of the office of the District Veterinary Officer, Emergency Section, up to the 25th January 1949. After partition the pre- paration post of Deputy Director of Veterinary Services (in Class I service) was abolished to serve the twofold purposes of effecting economy in administration and of reducing the post as the section was not in itself a Directorate or that its work would not come up to the standard of a Directorate. But this was a miscalculation, as after partition the quality and quantity of work of the Field Section increased enormously and the post of Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Headquarters, had of neces- sity to be created as evidently without this aid to the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, the running of the administration would have been impossible. Ranges. Eastern Range.2 Western Range.3 Propaganda Section. Sri B. K. Gupta, Sri K. P. Neogi and Sri S. M. Dhar, one after another, beld charge of the Propaganda Section during the year under report. Sri Neogi held office for a very short time and was succeeded by Sri Dhar in the early part of January 1949 and remained in charge of the section fort the rest of the year under report. After partition the Propaganda Section became handicapped for shortage of models and other equipments. The portion of the equipments and models taken away to East Bengal have not yet been replenished. In spite of this handicap this section continued to render valuable service to the people at large to cope with man's ignorance in veterinary matters, a task of enormous magnitude which had to be prosecuted persistently though slowly. Every endeavour was made from this section, with the resources at its disposal, to impart veterinary know- ledge specially to the rural people. Altogether 11 out of 15 shows and exhibitions were attended. Stalls were opened in them and demonstrations were held by attractive models and pictorial posters. A show-room of the Propaganda Section is maintained in one of the rooms of the office of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, furnished with interesting and instructive models, charts and pathological specimens to draw the attraction of the visitors who step into it. This section before partition, was equipped with Cinema Machine and several educative films. But the machine being taken away to East Bengal with all its accessories, the work of this section has been greatly handicapped. Glanders Section. This section consists of 7 Glanders Inspectors including a Chief, 8 constables including one head constable and 5 Field Assistants under the control of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services. They are mainly meant for the control of scheduled diseases under Glanders and Farcy Act. It may be noted that they deal with diseases which are communicable to human beings. In addition to the above duty this staff is employed and their services are utilised for the efficient control of contagious diseases that break out amongst the cattle within the jurisdiction of Calcutta, Howrah, Tollygunge, Barrackpore, Dum Dum, Cossipore and other adjacent municipalities. They remained busy mostly to control the Rinderpest outbreaks in their jurisdic- tion which was the deadly scourge of cattle and they effectively controlled outbreaks which came to their notice during their tour or were reported to them from time to time. One Glanders Inspector also worked in the area of Kalimpong where outbreak of Glanders was rather common. This disease has been found prevalent among mules and ponies which are imported from Tibet and the spread of the disease was being augmented by unregulated movements of the infected animals from Tibet area into West Bengal State. This is a very important post and has so far rendered satisfactory service in check- ing the spread of the disease. This important post of Glanders Inspector was held by Sri L. B. Mukhia who rendered very satisfactory service in checking the spread of the disease. Mass Inoculation Section. The Mass Inoculation Section consists of a District Veterinary Officer, a Staff Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, 3 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 38 Field Assistants, whose duty it is to launch wholesale vaccination for protection of the cattle against contagious diseases as per programme.
4 This staff are mainly working to protect cattle against Rinderpest. During the year under report mass vaccination of cattle against rinderpest was undertaken in the districts of Burdwan, Bankura, Midnapore, West Dinajpur, Darjeeling, Birbhum, Murshidabad and 24-Parganas along the main routes of cattle movement and in cattle markets. The total number of cattle protected against rinderpest during the year was 1,158,085. The figure is promising no doubt, but this section had to operate under difficult circum- stances for the unsympathetic attitude of the owners of cattle for their ignorance about the benefit. Moreover, this section could not be manned to its full strength due to sanction of the set-up not being received. Besides the above work this section in collaboration with the District Veterinary Officer, Poultry, and the District Veterinary staff protected 15,150 fowls against fowl pox, 10,933 fowls against ranikhet and 1,605 fowls against fowl cholera (Reference Table No. III). Research Section. The Research Section is under the supervision of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services and the main function of the section is to manufacture Goat Tissue Vaccine for protection of cattle against rinderpest. Sri M. B. Menon (now deceased) held charge of the Veterinary Research Institute and control of the sub-section at Kurseong throughout the year under report except for the period from the 3rd May 1948 to the 2nd July 1948 when he was on leave and when Sri B. B. Chakravarti officiated in the vacancy in addition to his own duties as Officer-in-charge, Poultry Research Institute. Mr. Menon was on tour for 10 days during the year for investigation of a very severe outbreak of verminous Bronchitis amongst pigs at Ghoom and for inspection of the sub-section at Kurseong. During the year under review the Research Institute supplied the required quantity of Goat Tissue Vaccine for West Bengal, as well as met the demand of this product from the Province of Assam and Tippera State. The research to increase the yield of Goat Tissue Vaccine by incorporation of other tissues from goats was carried on with no satisfactory result. Investigation works into Helminthic diseases of obscure nature like Amphistomiasis in cattle, sheep and goats and Microfilariasis in horses and into Protozoan diseases, such as Thilariasis and Sarcosporidiasis in cattle were carried on. Symptoms simulating those of Surra were detected in horses due to the presence of Microfilaria in blood. Examination of specimens (blood smears, stool, etc.) sent from different districts of West Bengal were carried on and diagnosed and results communicated with all promptitude. Poultry Research. At the time of partition of Bengal all the instruments and appliances belonging to this section were removed to East Bengal. This section could not be equipped with necessary instruments and appliances during the year under report and as such Ranikhet Disease Vaccine could not be manu- factured. The supply was maintained by indenting vaccines in lump from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Sri B. B. Chakravarti held charge of this section for the period under report. Treatment of Diseases, Contagious Disease.5 during the year under report no comparative figure is possible to be sub- mitted against the whole year of 1947-48 as the record for the full year is not available. During the year under report the total deaths of all domesticated animals including poultry was accounted to be 5,099 animals and 899 birds, total = 5,998 as against 3,472 which occurred during the six months of the previous year from 15th August 1947 to 31st March 1948. Altogether the above deaths occurred in 1,241 epidemics as against 809 of the last year within 6 months after partition of Bengal. In comparison with the number of outbreaks of the last year the figure of this full year is not appreciably high. It was not the rinderpest alone that swelled the figure this year, but it was due to the receipt of a good number of notices of outbreaks of Haemorrhagic Septicaemia from the districts of Burdwan, Midnapore and 24-Parganas that the figure shot up. The number of Prophylactic Inoculation undertaken against various contagious diseases (including fowl diseases and Mass Inoculation) was 13,62,525. By prompt attendance of outbreaks and by adopting the process of Mass Inoculation the death rate was appreciably reduced. To educate the people on veterinary matters, specially on contagious diseases, propaganda was undertaken as far as practicable by the district staff and Propaganda Section. Equine Diseases. Surra (Trypanosomiasis).6 Haemorrhagic Septicaemia.7 Other Diseases. Rabies.8 The expenditure on the scheme for the period under report was Rs. 16,560-0-0. These hospitals rendered efficient service in the localities where they were established. 3,738 out-patients and 57 in-patients were treated in these hospitals during the year. Moreover, 277 cases were supplied with medicine which were not brought to the hospitals. Fees realised from these hospitals amounted to Rs. 495-0-0. General Remarks. After partition of Bengal, this is the first comprehensive Annual Report for the year 1948-49. Comparative figures where necessary have not been possible to be furnished as the full report for the year 1947-48 could not be compiled for non-availability of records after partition. It is a matter of great satisfaction that the Collectors and Subdivisional Officers took keen interest in veterinary matters, especially in the control of epidemic diseases. Veterinary staff as a whole were enthusiastic and active to perform their duties. It is not possible to single out individuals who did best, but it will be failing in duty if it is not said that the whole technical and clerical staff acquitted themselves well. P. C. BANERJEE, Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Government of West Bengal Home (Publicity) Department Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Field and Research Section West Bengal and Bengal Veterinary College and Hospital For the Year 1950-51 Superintendent, Government Printing West Bengal Government Press, Alipore, West Bengal 1953 PriceAnnual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department (Field and Research Section), 1950-51 The new set-up of the Directorate of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, was sanctioned with effect from the 1st June 1950 during the year under report. It was also decided during the year that the work of the Directorate would be conducted under the guidance of a Technical Director to be appointed exclusively for the Veterinary Directorate. But as no Technical Officer was appointed as the Director, Sri K. K. Ghosh, I.A.S., Director of Food Production, West Bengal, continued as the Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, in addition to his own duties. Sri P. C. Banerji, B.H.V.S., Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, was in the direct charge of the Field and Research Section of the Directorate during 1950-51. The Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, also continued to be a member of the Advisory Board of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, and of the Animal Diseases and Pests Committees. He attended the meetings of the above Committees during the year under report at New Delhi, Dehra Dun and Izatnagar. He was also a member of the Managing Committee of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Calcutta, and of the governing body of the Bengal Veterinary College, Belgachia. The Assistant Director was on tour for 84 days, covering 7,312 miles on rail, 928 miles on road and 500 miles by air. During his tour he inspected most of the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries and imparted general instruc- tions to the subordinate staff on the spot for further improvement of the Depart- mental work. The post of the Superintendent of Veterinary Services, Headquarters, was held by Sri C. C. Das Gupta during the year. At the later part of the year Sri S. N. Barman was appointed to the post of the Personal Assistant to the Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, and he continued in that post till the close of the year. Ranges. For convenience of work the entire State has been divided into three Ranges, viz., the Northern Range, the Eastern Range and the Western Range with head- quarters at Jalpaiguri, Calcutta and Midnapore, respectively. Each Range is under the charge of a Superintendent of Veterinary Services. Northern Range.2 Western Range.3 The Disease Investigation Section. The work of this Section was conducted under the direct control of the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services, West Bengal, throughout the year. This Section consists of four branches, viz.4 The chief object of this Section is to give a check to the contagious diseases of cattle5 Besides these, they carried on mass inoculation, chiefly against Rinderpest and Anthrax and thus protected 19,367 heads of cattle against Rinderpest and 4,782 heads against Anthrax. These figures of mass vaccination performed by this Section have duly been incorporated in the statement of Mass Inoculation Section. Poultry Section. The Veterinary Inspector, Poultry Section, with the Veterinary Field Assistants promptly attended to all outbreaks of Poultry diseases whenever their services were requisitioned. The Officer-in-charge had to undertake extensive tours throughout the State in response to the calls from different directions. This officer with the help of the district staff attended to 43 outbreaks of Poultry diseases and inoculated 8,850 birds in the face of outbreaks. They also vacci- nated 43,102 heads of birds against various contagious diseases as a prophylactic measure. Research Section. During the year under report Sri M. C. Mitra held charge of the Veterinary Vaccine Section and control of the Sub-section at Kurseong where Sri R. D. Singh was in charge for the whole year under report. During the year 1,031,300 and 355,350 doses of Goat tissue vaccine moist and desicated respectively were manufactured by the main centre and the Sub- section and supplied to the field workers for prophylactic vaccination against Rinderpest in this State. Besides, out of the said production following quantity of Goat tissue vaccine ampoules were supplied to different States as shown below:6 equipments, three bulls and one buffalo. None of these bulls were working when they were taken. Some time after, work was, however, started with some of them after changing their diet and giving them regular exercise. Immediately after provincialisation four new sub-centres were started at Behala, Howrah, Broad Street and Sodepore to enable the cattle owners to get its fullest benefit. One Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and one Field Assistant were also deputed from Mass Vaccination Section to assist the Officer-in-charge of Artificial Insemination Work to meet the growing demands of the public. Semen samples were regularly collected from bulls and buffaloes and trans- ported regularly to different centres through thermosflask. For the period from 16th May 1950 to 31st March 1951, 2,033 animals were inseminated. Out of these 1,778 were cows and 255 buffaloes. Besides the above 182 sterility cases of different kinds were attended and treated during the period under report. The average conception rate was 69.2 per cent. The enclosed comparative chart for the year and the preceding year will show the encouraging progress of the work and the growing popularity of Artificial Insemination and its demand amongst classes of cattle owners.

The disease was confirmed by usual laboratory tests at a later stage when the characteristic lesions were found prominent in pro- tracted cases. In the case of early mortality, films from heart blood of affected cases usually proved "negative". (ii) Salmonellosis was identified in two reports. The outbreaks were con- trolled after some preliminary loss, but adoption of strict sanitary measures, removal of overcrowding and dividing the flock into small units, restraining the birds from going to pond and, internally, one Cibazol tablet a day in the mash, liberal supply of greens and soluthiazole in drinking water, 2.5 gms. in a gallon.
