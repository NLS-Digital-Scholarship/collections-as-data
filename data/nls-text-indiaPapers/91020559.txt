Section I.2 REPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1922 INDIAN STATES. 14. All the Indian States in Rajputana were free from all epidemic diseases during the year under report except Dungarpur in which Influenza broke out in an epidemic form in the month of February in a village named Barote. There were in all 103 seizures of which only 3 proved fatal. The disease was imported from Gujrat. Timely preventive and quarantine measures were taken to check its spread. 15. There were a few sporadic cases of Small-pox in the Jhalawar State. SANITATION. 16. The sanitation of the City of Ajmer could hardly be worse than it is, and this unsanitary state of affairs has been commented upon for many years in this Report. What is not realized is that efficient sanitation is an expensive matter and that when there is no money and no water it is also a difficult problem. 17. At the present moment, in round figures one rupee eight annas a year is spent per head of the population, on sanitation. A ridiculously small sum, particularly when there is good reason to infer that for such money, as is spent, full value is not received. 18. The whole matter is under the consideration of a Small Committee, who are considering alternate Schemes, but it can be stated with certainty that any efficient scheme will cost more than is spent on sanitation at present. Conse- quently the matter is largely one of finance. 19. The Birat System of Sweepers has been condemned year after year, and with justice, and there is no doubt that until this system is broken the sanitation of Ajmer will suffer, so long and so far as it depends on the work of these men. 20. An effort is being made to make the Tramway Station more efficient and with an improved work-shop it is hoped to maintain the Carts and Tramway Rolling Stock in better order. 21. The condition of the Bullocks is definitely good they are well fed and cared for. 22. The Motor Lorry has been over worked and over loaded and consequently has not proved the success expected ; but there is no doubt that its acquisition was a step in the right direction and it is to be hoped that in course of time all rubbish will be removed by Mechanical means and that relic of a bygone age, the bullock cart will disappear. 23. For all practical purposes, the water supply of Ajmer can be always con- sidered as too deficient for any water-borne scheme consequently the night soil must either be trenched or incenerated. The latter course recommend itself as the most efficient cheaper and more easily worked and controlled of the two. More- over once established, the rubbish could be disposed of in a similar way. 24. There remains the sullage water. The present system of so called water tight cisterns and tin receptacles is as bad as it can be. A walk through any part of the city will reveal cisterns full and overflowing with foul water, leaking recep- tacles and even many drifting drains without receptacles at all. It would appear that some system of drainage is a desideration. Ajmer is ideally situated for such, as it is on the site of a hill, and with the waste water from the hydrants, a comparatively small head of water would suffer to keep such a drainage system flushed. The initial outlay would be considerable and the matter requires detailed examination, but without some such system it is difficult to provide a solution for the sullage water question. WATER SUPPLY. 25. The Monsoon only yielded Ajmer 13.29 inches and steps were not taken early enough to consume the supply, consequently there was a great shortage of water towards the end of the year under review. However the Wells held out wonderfully and by mixing a little Budha Pushkar water with that from Bhaonta

Fortunately no harm resulted from this procedure though the Budha Pushkar water was reported as impotable. Village Sanitation, Ajmer-Merwara. Ajmer Sub-Division4 REPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1922 Statement II. Expenditure on Vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara. 39. The total expenditure on vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara was Rs. 5,117-6-2 against Rs. 4,671-11-2 in the previous year. The increase of Rs. 445-11-0 was due to increase of pay of Vaccinators and in rate of travelling allowance. The average cost of each successful case was 72 pies against 75 pies in 1921-22. Expenditure on Vaccination in Indian States. 40. The total expenditure on vaccination in Indian States was Rs. 61,405-3-2 as compared with Rs. 54,402-7-4 in the previous season, the increase in cost being due to pay and travelling allowance to Vaccination Staff.

The profits from jail manufactures amounted to Rs. 6,186-11-4 against Rs. 3,926-1-5 in 1921. The average earning per head of prisoners employed on Jail manufactures was Rs. 53-10-1 against Rs. 28-9-7 in 1921. Considering that a sum of Rs. 937-13 was outstanding and money bags of the value over Rs. 1,800 remained unsold at the close of the year, the working of the Jail factory is most satisfactory. 13.

Section I.2 REPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1924 14. The mortality from Bowel complaints was 204 against 261 in the previous year. 15. Deaths from Respiratory diseases shew an increase of 62 as compared with last year. 16. Small-Pox appeared in a modified form in the month of March 1924 and continued till the close of the year under review. INDIAN STATES. 17. The Indian States of Jhalawar, Kishengurh, Western Rajputana including Sirohi and Jaisalmer, Mewar, Banswara, Bundi and Tonk were free from all epidemic diseases. Cases of Small-Pox were reported from some parts of Mewar. In the Jaipur city the said epidemic prevailed in a very virulent form in the first 5 months of the year under report and accounted for not less than 382 deaths amongst children. 18. Bharatpur State.AND ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1924-25. 3 26. Some new latrines are being built and the old ones put in better repair : but much work is to be done in this direction yet. 27. Villages growing up in the neighbourhood are becoming an increasing menace to the public health, as no interest is taken in the way of town planning and conservancy. 28. The lanes and streets are in the same dreadful condition as before and the constant encroachments on the already narrow streets and lanes will rapidly make them impassable. 29. Thanks to good rains, there is plenty of water and now we will forget about the last three lean years until the supply begins to fail again. I believe the well sunk under the auspices of a magician has proved a failure. 30. Tuberculosis in all its worst forms is rife in Ajmer and I can see no hope for the population living in dark rooms in dark and dirty alleys and streets. An American Mission has started a Tuberculosis Sanitorium at Madar about six miles from the city : but unfortunately the road there is impassable. I hope it will help in the alleviation of this disease. 31. The great number of deaths from fevers and chest complaints is probably greatly due to Influenza. 32. The infantile death rate is very high : but I have great hopes of improve- ments from the new infant welfare centres run by the Lady Doctors of the Scottish Mission, which has been started in connection with baby week. 33. The Sanitary Sub-Committee of the Municipality appears to be anxious to work for the remedy of many of these ills and thanks the members who undertake the duties of ward Superintendents and are regular attendants both at the meetings of the Conservancy Sub-Committee and the weekly inspections of the city. 34. The Sanitary Inspector Mohamad Raza Khan has worked well and done his best. He is hard working and honest: but he cannot be expected to manage the supervision of the conservancy and office alone. I hope an Assistant Health Officer will be appointed soon, who will see that the staff and office are improved.

The mortality among children under 5 years of age was 52.15 per cent of the total deaths against 50.55 in the previous year. 11. 3,408 Children of under one year died a percentage of 29.28 of the total deaths registered against 30.36 in 1924. 12. 480 deaths from Tuberculosis were registered in Ajmer City and Suburbs as compared with 583 in the previous year. These are included in deaths from fevers. 13. There was no epidemic disease in Ajmer-Merwara throughout the year under report except 1,151 deaths from Small-pox and 53 from Influenza as com- pared with 615 and nil in the previous year ; but in my opinion many of the deaths attributed to fevers and Respiratory diseases were really due to Influenza. 14. 7,984 deaths from fevers were reported against 8,932 in 1924 showing a decrease of 948. 15. The mortality from Bowel complaints was 142 against 204 in the previous year. 16. Deaths from Respiratory diseases show a decrease of 8 deaths as compared with last year. 17. Small-pox which appeared in the modified form in March 1924 continued since then till the close of the year 1925. INDIAN STATES. 18. The Indian States of Jhalawar. Kotah, Marwar, Bikaner, Mewar, Tonk, Bundi, Banswara, Dungarpur and Kishengarh were free from all epidemic diseases except a few cases of Influenza in Gangdhar Tahsil of Jhalawar and a few scattered cases of Small-pox in the Kotah and Marwar States. There were also a few cases of Small-pox, Influenza and relapsing fever in some parts of Mewar. 19. Jaipur.AND ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1925-26. 3 SANITATION AND WATER SUPPLY. (Sanitation.) 22. The Sanitary condition of Ajmer city continues to be very bad, inspite of efforts to improve it : the struggle is against the usual lack of funds and the lack of Sanitary education of the people. 23. The Birat system of conservancy cannot be too strongly condemned. 24. We have now two Motor lorries constantly removing rubbish : but still it is accumulating and another will have to be purchased. 25. The few incinerators we have are working well. 26. Some new latrines are being built and the old ones put in better repair but much work has to be done in this direction yet. 27. Villages growing up in the neighbourhood are becoming an increasing menaee to the public health, as no interest is taken in the way of town planning and conservancy. 28. The lanes and streets are in the same dreadful condition as before, and the constant condonation of encroachments on the already narrow streets and lanes will rapidly make them impassable. WATER SUPPLY. 29. The Water supply always insufficient has already begun to run out and I fear very much for the summer months when Bowel complaints will be certain to increase owing to the bad quality of the water. 30. Tuberculosis in all its worst forms is rife in Ajmer and I can see no hope for the population living in dark rooms in dark and dirty allyways and streets. An American Mission has started a Tuberculosis Sanitorium at Madar about six miles from the city ; but unfortunately the road there is almost impassable : I hope it will help in the alleviation of this disease. 31. The infantile death rate is very high ; but I have great hopes of improve- ments from the new infant welfare centre run by the Lady Doctors of the Scottish Mission, which has been started in connection, with Baby Week. 32. We have now a qualified Assistant Health Officer Dr. Nabhan who helps the Sanitary Inspector in his work and has drawn up a scheme for the improve- ment of the Sanitation of Ajmer which, though it proposes to deal with all night- soil by incineration, has no really helpful suggestion for the waste water. Both Dr. Nabhan and Mohamed Raza Khan, Sanitary Inspector, have worked well. Village Sanitation, Ajmer-Merwara, Ajmer Sub-Division4 REPORT ON SANITATION, DISPENSARIES AND JAILS IN RAJPUTANA FOR 1925 36. The aggregate of both Primary Vaccination and Re-vaccination was 17,137 against 15,949 in the previous year, showing an increase of 1,188 vaccina- tions. 37. The average number of Vaccinators employed during the year under report was 15 with an Indian Superintendent, the same as last year. 38. Each vaccinator performed an average of 1,120 operations against 1,029 in the previous year. 39. Fresh Calf Lymph was obtained for the Vaccination season from Septem- ber to the end of March 1926, from Manpur Central Depot in Central India and during the non-working season from the Punjab Vaccine Depot Murree. 40. The Civil Surgeon of Ajmer-Merwara inspected 391 vaccinated children in six towns and villages against 785 in 1924-25, of whom 383 were found success- ful. The decrease is due to the fact that Koli families at Nagra and others in Suburbs refuse to bring their children for inspection. 41. The Superintendent of Vaccination, Nasirabad Cantonment, examined 165 chidren against 55 in the previous year of whom 157 were found successful. 42.

Re-vaccination full from 14,485 to 10,119 in the year under report. 45. There were 185 vaccinators against 184 in 1924-25. The increase is due to the appointment of a vaccinator at Mount Abu during the Vaccination season. 46. 22.49 per thousand of the population in the Indian States were success- fully vaccinated against 21.90 in 1924-25. Statement II. Expenditure on Vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara. 47. The total expenditure in Ajmer-Merwara was Rs. 6,319-3-6 against Rs. 5,205-5-4 in the previous year showing an increase of Rs. 1,113-14-2 which is due to the revision of scale of pay of the Indian Superintendent and Vaccinators from 1st March 1925. Expenditure on Vaccination in Indian States. The average cost of each successful case was 80 pies against 69 pies in 1924-25. 48. The total expenditure on Vaccination in Indian states was Rs. 65,941-6-1 against Rs. 63,879-13-10 in the previous season showing an increase of Rs. 2,061-8-3 which was due mainly to the revision and improvement of grades of Vaccinators and junior Inspectors in Marwar. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 218 pies in Abu to nil in Deoli where the work is done by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. 49. The following table shows the number of towns and villages inspected and vaccination seen by Residency or State Surgeons in Indian States :AND ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1925-26 5 50.

The total number of deaths registered during the year under report was 15,692 against 11,639 in 1925 shewing an increase of 4,053.

Statement I. 37. In Ajmer-Merwara including Nasirabad Cantonment, the total number of persons vaccinated was 15,613 against 16,804 in 1925-26 shewing a decrease of 1,191. The total number of Primary operations fell from 15,216 in 1925-26 to 15,079 and the number of Primary successful vaccination rose from 13,709 to 14,275. 38. The aggregate of both Primary Vaccination and Re-vaccination was 15,613 against 17,137 in the previous year shewing a decrease of 1,524. 39. The average number of Vaccinators employed during the year under report was 16 with an Indian Superintendent shewing an increase of one vaccinator sanctioned by the Ajmer Municipality. 40. Each vaccinator performed an average of 976 operations against 1,120 in the previous year. 41. Fresh Calf Lymph was obtained from the Punjab Vaccine Lymph Dept as the Vaccine Lymph supplied by the Manpur and Gwalior Vaccine Lymph Depts gave unsatisfactory results. 42. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 29.80 against 30.42 in the previous year. General Operations in Indian States. 43. The total number of Primary Vaccinations in Indian States was 230,686 of which 217,522 were successful as com- pared with 236,903 Primary and 219,658 successful operations in 1925-26. Re-vaccination fell from 10,119 to 9,835 in the year under report. 44. There were 184 vaccinators against 185 in 1925-26. The difference is due to a decrease of two vaccinators in the Kotah and Sirohi States and increase of one in the Jaipur State. 45. 22.19 per thousand of the population in the Indian States were successfully vaccinated against 22.49 in 1925-26. Statement II. Expenditure on vaccination in Ajmer-Merwara. 46. The total expenditure in Ajmer-Merwara was Rs. 6,822-12-11 against Rs. 6,319-3-6 shewing an increase of Rs. 503-9-5 which is due to the fact that the difference between the old scale of pay of Vaccinators and the new scale sanctioned by the Government from 1st March 1925 was paid by the Ajmer Municipality during the year under report. The average cost of each successful case was 88 pies against 80 in the previous year. Expenditure on vaccination in Indian States. 47. The total expenditure on vaccination in Indian States was Rs. 65,043-12-10 against Rs. 65,941-6-1 in the previous season shewing a decrease of Rs. 897-9-3 which is due to the fact that Vaccination work in Dungarpur, Kotah, Bundi, Mewar, Alwar, Bharatpur and Jaipur States was somewhat less than usual. In Dungarpur the decrease was due to the neglect of duty of one of the four vaccinators, in Mewar it was due to illness of three of the vaccinators in the working season while in Alwar Plague prevalent in the Districts was responsible for the decrease. The average cost of each successful vaccination in different States varied from 873 pies in Jaisalmer to nil in Deoli where the work is done by the Sub-Assistant Surgeon. Statement V. 48.
