PAGE Original articlesORIGINAL ARTICLES TREATMENT OF STRANGLES WITH SULPHANILAMIDE By F. C.MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, and MAJOR W. P. S. EDWARDS, Indian Military Veterinary Laboratory, Lahore (Received for publication on 24 July 1944) (With 39 text-figures) As part of a plan for the investigation of strangles in the Army Remount Depots of Mona and Sargodha in the Punjab, it was decided to make a systematic trial of sulphanilamide, leaving an equal number of controls treated by ordinary methods. The present paper gives the results so far obtained and the opportunity is taken to discuss the whole problem with an eye to the future. Strangles in young horses at these depots has always been a major problem and two papers dealing with the matter from the epizootiological stand- point have been published [Minett, LITERATURE The history and nature of the sulphona- mide compounds, their dosage and views on their mode of action are matters which have been discussed by a number of authors and extensive repetition is un- necessary. Some of the most recent information on the causal agent of strangles is fur- nished by Bazeley and Battle [1940] in Australia. From 415 cases of serious and typical equine diseases they isolated 457 strains of hæmolytic streptococci. All of these belonged to Lancefield's sero- logical group C, in fact the horse is the commonest source of these organisms just as man is the usual source of group A streptococci and the cow of group B streptococci. By agglutination, five main types could be distinguished among the 457 strains while biochemically they fell into five types: (a) Str. equi, which fer- mented neither lactose, sorbitol nor trehalose; (b) 'equine 1' which fermented sorbitol; (c) 'equine 2' which fermented trehalose. Types (b) and (c) might or might not ferment lactose in addition and they are generally referred to as Str. pyogenes equi. All the strains isolated from fresh strangles pus were Str. equi (agglutinative type 1) and this type was also associated with some cases of res- piratory catarrh. There appears to be no doubt as to the sensitivity of group C streptococci to sulphonamide preparations. Stableforth [1938] reported that sulphanilamide would protect mice against 100 to 1000 or even more minimal lethal doses of culture. Descazeaux, Courtade and Rocq [1939] in similar tests used a virulent hæmolytic streptococcus isolated from a strangles abscess. An 18-hour serum broth culture of this organism in dose of 0.5 c.c. of 10-7 dilution intraperitoneally was regularly fatal in mice. In the tests 0.5 c.c. 10-4 dilution (i.e. 1000 fatal doses) was used and this killed nine out of the ten control mice within 48 hours and the remaining one within 72 hours. Of 10 mice similarly inoculated but also given sulphanilamide2 Treatment of Strangles with Sulphanilamide doubt that they have a direct effect on bacterial metabolism (inhibition of an essential enzyme reaction) leading to bacteriostasis and that the phagocytic cells of the body are the actual killing agents. This effect was nicely shown by Gay and Clark [1937] in the case of an experimental streptococcus empyema in rabbits. The phagocytic cells themselves are unharmed by concentrations of the drug which are active against bacteria. McIntosh and Whitby [1939] have shown that the drugs are not simple germicides, although, as Colebrook, Buttle and O'Meara [1936] had pointed out for sul- phanilamide, the drug is bactericidal on small numbers of hæmolytic streptococci in culture medium and in blood. It is also known that they are not immediately active in vitro or in vivo; they are active on highly virulent organisms and those in the logarithmic phase of growth, and there is a quantitative relationship between effective dose and the number of bacteria attacked. Further, it is decided that the drugs do not neutralize toxins, they do not stimulate the activity of leucocytes nor influence the production or quality of specific immune bodies. The compounds are easily diffusible in the body and are very effective in a medium which is a poor one for the organism, e. g. urine or blood. On the other hand, as Fleming [1941] has shown, pus inhibits the action of sulphanilamide, so that it should not be used on grossly septic wounds. The sulphonamide drugs which are chiefly in use at the present time are sulphanilamide, sulphapyridine (M & B 693) and sulphathiazole. Sulphanilamide is capable of dealing with most hæmolytic streptococcus infections, is active against Cl. welchii, meningococci, gonococci, Bact. coli and Proteus, but is relatively inactive against staphylococci and pneumococci. Sulphapyridine is active against hæmolytic streptococci, pneumococci and Cl. welchii and has some action against staphylococci and Cl. septicum. Sulphathiazole is not only active against hæmolytic streptococci but is also definitely better than the other two against staphylococcus infections. Finally, it is to be noted that among bac- teria belonging to susceptible species drug-resistant strains are sometimes met with. An apposite illustration of this was recently reported by Hendry [1942]. A horse undergoing immunization with group A hæmolytic streptococci developed a streptococcus septicæmia and died in spite of 10 days treatment with sulphanilamide. The streptococci isolated from the blood of the animal, the day before its death were considerably more resistant to sul- phanilamide by in vitro tests than were the organisms used for immunization. Since the early days when prontosil was found to be efficient in reducing the mortality in human puerperal fever, it has become apparent that the sulphonamides are of value in a number of other human infections, streptococcal and otherwise, particularly the more acute class of disease. However, their efficacy has not been proved in all cases, e.g. French [1939] in a series of painstaking and controlled observations was unable to demonstrate any useful action in scarlet fever. All careful practitioners realize that the drug should be given as early as possible, in full dosage, at proper inter- vals, and for a sufficient length of time, say up to 10 days. Continuation without an interval beyond this time may lead to leucopenia and anæmia. If relapses appear, dosing should be recommended. Water intake should be restricted and medicines containing sulphur withheld. It is good practice if possible to make periodic estimations of the sulphonamide concentration in the blood, since the rate of absorption and excretion varies some- what in different individuals. Bazeley, Jokobowicz and Splatt [1940] give a convenient dosage table for horses. Thus, to attain a concentration of sulphanila- mide of 5 mg. per cent in the blood, a horse weighing 1000 lb. would require 90 gm. the first day and 60 gm. on subsequent days. For a 750 lb. horse the amounts
F. C. MINETT, AND W. P. S. EDWARDS 3 re 67 and 45 gm. During the present var, sulphanilamide, applied daily as a lusting powder, has been found useful n ridding wounds of hæmolytic streptococ- [Colebrook, 1941]. In this case the ound should either be a fresh one or one in which granulation is proceeding. in fact, sulphanilamide can sometimes be used in this way when dosage by the mouth is contraindicated. In some acute streptococcus infections n horses, e.g. pneumonia, sulphanilamide s of outstanding value [Descazeaux et al, 1939; Hignett, 1940; Steck, 1940; Baze- ey, 1940-1]; in chronic conditions, e.g. chronic sinusitis or nasal catarrh, fistulous withers [Arnold, 1939; Bazeley, 1940] the drug is of less value. The following workers have reported on trials with sulphanilamide or related compounds in strangles (the numbers in parenthesis show the number of cases treated): 1938, Guerret (11). 1939, Douglas and Walker (3) Descazeaux et al. (8) Arnold (5) 1940, Steck (at least 32) Knowles (15) Bazeley (1) 1941, Jastrzebski (?) Leo (31). Kurzenhauser (?) The salient points of this work are, (1) Impressions as to the value of the treatment are in general somewhat vari- able. This is not surprising because the disease is not a killing one and the course and clinical manifestations are themselves ather inconstant. Also, cases acting as controls were not always kept. (2) There is fair unanimity as to the avourable effect of the treatment on the ever. This in itself must mean that the drug has some influence on the infection. (3) There are indications that the drug nhibits inflammatory 4 Treatment of Strangles with Sulphanilamide One control animal was observed at the same time as the experimental case, except that for the three 'larger dose' horses trea- ted at Sargodha 1940-41 only two suitable controls were available. By 'ordinary dose' is meant 1 gm. sulphanilamide per 10 lb. body weight* daily for 10 consecutive days, while the 'larger dose' was intended to mean four doses each of 80 gm. on alternate days. Had the 'larger' dose programme been adhered to strictly, it would have meant giving the animals about half the total amount of sulphanilamide administered to those on 'ordinary' doses. Actually, a few got more and a few less than the intended dosage (see Results). Dosage was commenced on the day of admission to hospital or on the next day. The daily 'ordinary' dose was divided in half, each half being given morning and evening. The 0.5 gm. tablets supplied were powder- ed and suspended in a pint of water and given by the nasal route by means of a stomach tube [Bazeley, 1940]. The 'larger' dose was given in the morning and usually at a single administration, No other treatment was given to the experimental cases but in all cases if abscesses developed they were opened at the proper time. The controls were chosen at the same time if possible as the experimental cases and in making the selection discrimination was avoided, save that if anything the experimental one was the more severe. Body temperatures were recorded twice daily, morning and even ing. Body weights were taken on admis- sion and (usually) on discharge, records were kept of symptoms and general condition, and the duration of hospitaliza tion was noted. TABLE I Mona.

On each occasion two cases with pyrexia and submaxillary swe- lling, with or without other symptoms, were picked out. Usually at this time both were of about the same severity but, if any difference, the more severe one was taken for sulphanilamide treatment. Sargodha 8. Sulphanilamide, three doses each of 82 gm. on 12 March, 15 March and 19 April 1941. Strangles developed previously, on 28 January 1941. Condition failed to improve, fed little and had frequent colic. Condition thereafter rapidly deteriorated and was very poor when sulphanilamide was started on 12 March 1941. Condition improved for a time and animal took normal feeds, but con- dition again deteriorated and colic reappeared. Animal became very dull and weak and was off-feed. Died on 7 May 1941. P. m: large abscess in lung and two small abscesses on pleura. 9. Sulphanilamide, two doses each of 82 gm. on 4 April and 7 April 1941. Strangles developed on 27 January 1941 but animal did not recover. Condition very poor and feeding little, when sul- phanilamide treatment started on 4 April. Condition thereafter improved and body weight increased. Discharged cured. 10. Sulphanilamide, three doses each of 82 gm. on 17, 19 and 22 April 1941. Fresh case. Heavy catarrh and feeding little. After treatment, condition im- proved. Discharged cured. 8. Had strangles on 12 April 1941 but did not recover. Condition poor but feeding well. Died on 4 April. P.m: large abscess in lungs; kidney 'full of pus'. 9. Strangles developed on 29 March 1941. Condition declined and horse was off- feed. Submax. abscess opened on 13 April 1941. Appeared to be recovering and was feeding fairly well. Showed colic. Died on 24 May 1941. P.m: large abscess in the intestines. Duration of hospitalization. The Vete- rinary Officer in charge at Mona (in June 1940) writes 'in most cases during administration of the drug abscesses showed signs of absorption and in five cases they absorbed completely; but in others they reappeared and had to be opened.
F. C. MINETT AND W. P. S. EDWARDS 11 The period of treatment was thus lengthe- ned. In some cases abscesses became multiple. Animals maintained their usual condition during treatment, only losing a little condition according to the severity of the attack and without relation to the administration period of the drug. After treatment, animals quickly regained con- dition except in those cases where absces- ses were completely absorbed. These were slow in picking up condition. In the doses used, sulphanilamide......tends to suppress abscesses. The duration of treat- ment may be considerably shortened by maturing abscesses by normal methods and by using sulphanilamide after abscesses have been emptied. As used in the depot, the efficacy of the drug is most marked dur- ing convalescence. In larger doses, sul- phanilamide may perhaps sterilize pri- mary abscesses altogether'. In a non-fatal disease such as strang- les it might be thought that the length of stay in hospital would be an index of some value in deciding the efficacy of a treat- ment. Actually, for various reasons ob- servations on this point are said to be no- toriously unreliable. In spite of the above remarks of the Veterinary Officer, examination of the figures shows that in the present series there was no difference in the period of hospitalization as between sulphanila- mide-treated and control horses. Thus, from Tables I-III there were 43 treated cases and 42 untreated cases which reco- vered12 Treatment of Strangles with Sulphanilamide [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

S.EDWARDS 15 a equine strangles. This would appear to be proved by the effect of the drug on the temperature curve, noted by other authors and also independently in the present series of cases by ourselves and the Veterinary Officers on the spot. There is also the evidence that the strep- tococcus of strangles is susceptible in vitro to the drug. It should be noted, however, that in strangles we are dealing with a streptococcus which has a pronounced tendency to cause suppurative changes; in the tissues, just the sort of morbid changes in which sulphanilamide is least likely to produce a dramatic effect. Granting, however, that the drug has some value, he question to be decided, perhaps, is how at the present time the sulphanilamide drugs should be used, since owing to the cost (prewar price of sulphanilamide in India was about 18 shillings per lb.) they could scarcely be given to every affected animal. Certainly in outbreaks of the magnitude commonly encountered in re- mount depots rigid selection of cases to be reated would be required, especially as half measures are likely to be of little value and an expenditure of at least 1 lb. f sulphanilamide is to be predicted for each adult horse. What is important is hat sulphanilamide should not be used in ractice in a routine or stereotyped man- er. As Whitby [1939] has put it: 'Both linical judgement and common sense are necessary to get the best effect with these rugs'. Admittedly, more information is required but in the circumstances it would seem best to reserve sùlphanilamide (a) r young stock on stud farms, because ey are valuable and the cost of treat- ent is relatively less; (b) for strangles ses which are not running the normal ild course; (c) probably most important r very early cases where there is a good ance of reducing fever, of inhibiting scess formation and possibly of leaving æhind a serviceable naturally acquired munity. In any event the policy may be adop- had of giving larger doses during the first two days and then continuing with smaller doses16 Treatment of Strangles with Sulphanilamide and, as there are indications that the purified reagent is both stable and an intensely active bacteriostatic, its use in practice may well become more general. At the same time, success is being achieved in the preparation of other antibac- terial products from cultures of various bacteria belonging to the Bacillus and Actinomyces groups. As mentioned above, the sulphonamide drugs have a bacteriostatic effect and it remains for the body cells to complete the process of destroying the invading orga- nisms. If the efficiency of the body cells in this respect can be augmented, the therapeutic results should be improved. Loewenthal [1939] has shown that in strep- tococcus infections in mice a combination of specific immune serum and sulphanila- mide is far more effective than either rea- gent alone. Now that Bazeley [1940-2, 1942] has shown that a vaccine of some efficiency can be prepared from Str.equi, there is a possibility of increasing the resistance of horses exposed to strangles and the opportunities for chemotherapy may be correspondingly enhanced. One last point that may again be emphasized is the importance of strict rest for strangles cases, both during the attack and during convalescence. SUMMARY Sulphanilamide is of some value in the treatment of equine strangles. As would be expected from the nature of the disease, the results are not apparent in all cases. The beneficial effects consist mainly in a reduction of fever and pro- bably to some extent in the localiza- tion of abscesses. While the question of adequate dosage and duration of treatment is always im- portant, sound clinical judgement is re- quired in using the sulphonamides. Thus, in outbreaks of strangles, sulphanilamide might be used on animals in which the disease is not running the normally mild course. It would probably be still more profitable to use the drug on very early cases when fever is a pronounced symp- tom. There is need for further properly controlled enquiry on cases selected as falling within these two categories.

ABDUSSALAM, Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore (Received for publication on 10 June 1943) (With Plate I) THE available literature shows that avian piroplasmosis has been only rarely and doubtfully recorded in India, the earliest reference to the subject being that by Lingard and Jennings [1904] who claimed to have seen pyroplasms in the blood of the British breeds of fowls in this country. Since these authors have not mentioned anything about the mor- phology of the parasite encountered by them, it is difficult to judge whether they were actually dealing with what is now known as Aegyptianella pullorum Carpano, or with some other haematozoon. The symptoms reported, such as anorexia, drowsiness, purplish comb, malaise and general indisposition, are also too general to be diagnostic of piroplasmosis and are common to many other poultry diseases. While studying spirochaetosis of im- ported and local breeds of fowls in Sudan, Balfour [1907; 190818 Piroplasmosis of the Demestic Fowl and rare intracorpuscular bodies, resemb- ling those described by Balfour (loc. cit.) from Sudan; no anaemic changes were, however, noticed. A diagnosis of spiro- chaetosis was made and an injection of soamin (1.5 grain in 1.0 ml. of distilled water) was given in the pectoral muscles. The fowl house, in which this bird had been kept, was found to be heavily infested with A. persicus, in all stages of development. About 200 adult specimens of the tick were collected for transmis- sion experiments, and the rest were des- troyed in their natural habitat by means of a braziers' lamp. Two days after the injection, the hen was seen again and found to be bright and apparently normal; and its temperature had come down to 106.0ºF. Microscopic examination of blood smears revealed no spirochaetes, but 'Balfour's bodies' were present as on the first day. A second intra-muscular injection of soamin (one grain in 1.0 ml. of distilled water) was given, and blood examined after the lapse of another day; 'Balfour's bodies' were still present as on the first day. On clinical grounds the bird was considered to have been cured. Blood smears from some other adult birds of the same flock were examined and found to contain similar intra-corpuscular bodies in small numbers and un-accompa- nied by clinical symptons. Subsequent examination of the indigenous fowls at Hissar, Kasur and Lahore resulted in similar findings. On closer examination the intra-corpus- cular bodies were found to be of two kinds; (i) medium-sized to large round bodies and rings (1.2 to 4.0µ), which were present in small numbersIndian J. vet Sci., Vol. XV, Part I] PLATE I [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.

On 8, 9 June both the chickens were noticed to be somnolent, their temperature had risen to 109.2º F. and 108.4º P. respec- tively, and their blood showed frequent spirochaetes. The erythrocytes showed no A. pullorum, but 'Coles' haematozoa' were present in small numbers. After this, the chickens could not be examined until 12 June when they were found to be brighter and feeding well, their temperatures being 106.0º F. and 105.8º F. respectively. They had, however, become markedly emaciated and their combs were very pale. Blood examination showed neither spirochaetes nor Aegyptianella. They were considered to have recovered from the primary attack of spirochaetosis. On 16 June (i. e. 14 days after the first batch of ticks had fed) the blood of both the chickens showed frequent A. pullorum with 'Coles' haematozoa' as before. A week later, A. pullorum became numerous in each field and continued to persist in large numbers until death. Symptoms and blood changes associated with this infection are mentioned below. The chickens in the flock, from which these two were taken, remained clinically healthy during this period and also during the rest of that summer. The foregoing results are liable to be regarded as having failed to establish conclusively that A. pullorum was trans- mitted by A. persicus, inasmuch as the cage, in which the experimental chickens were kept, was not proof against other biting arthropods (e.g. mosquitoes) whilst, as already mentioned, one of the chickens had, in addition, received an injection of infected blood. However, in view of the experience of previous workers [Bedford and Coles, 1933] and the appearance of A. pullorum in peripheral blood after the lapse of an incubation period of 14 days, it seems highly probable that tick bites were the source of infection in these chickens. * Subsequent observantions showed that this injection did not have any effect on the course of the disease in this chicken as compared to its companion. Bedford and Coles [1933] have experi- mentally established that Argas persicus can transmit aegyptianellosis to healthy fowls with an incubation period of 12 to 15 days and that the ticks may remain infective for at least 162 days. The presence of Coles' haematozoon in fowls living in tick-free fowl houses apparently shows that it is transmitted by an agent other than Argas. Coles [1937] also recorded this parasite from the vici- nity of New York where, according to him, Argas was not likely to occur. SYMPTOMS AND BLOOD CHANGES It will be seen from what is stated above that piroplasms (A. pullorum and Coles' haematozoon) do not, as a rule, set up any appreciable symptoms in adult indigenous fowls or adult fowls of the White Leghorn breed which had lived for several generations in India. In the blood of these adult birds the piroplasms exist in small numbers. In the case of one bird an attack of natural spirochaetosis did not resuscitate the piroplasms; this disease was, however, treated quite soon after its appearance in the bird. In the case of two six weeks' old White Leghorn chickens which showed A. pullo- rum following tick bites, clinical symptoms associated with the infection were studied. Both these birds first suffered from a mild attack of spirochaetosis which they survived without any treatment. A. pull)- rum first appeared in their blood 14 days after the first bites of infected ticks. At this time the only symptoms noticed were slight dullness and anorexia. Blood exa- mination at this stage revealed 43 per cent of erythrocytes to be infected. A week later, sleepiness, dullness, emaciation and anaemia became well marked and the appetite capricious. The comb was quite blanched and the blood when drawn out of a needle prick was noticed to be dis- tinctly watery. Body temperature showed a constant rise by 1.0º F. or so. Micros- copic examination of blood revealed a heavy infestation of the red blood cells (60 per cent) with merozoits, small and
20 Piroplasmosis of the Demestic Fowl large rings, and 'rosette' forms of A. pullorum. The erythrocytes showed dis- tinct polychromatia but it was notable that only the non-infected red cells had undergone this change. Coles' haemato- zoon was also present in small numbers and seemed to have undergone no appa- rent change in numbers as a result of the bites of infected ticks. The symptoms described above, particularly anæmia and emaciation, progressed till death occurred 27 days after the first appearance of A. pullorum in one case and 30 days in the other. Diarrhoea was noticed two days before death. No signs of paralysis were noticed in the legs or wings. It may be mentioned that mortality from aegyptianellosis has been also re- corded from many other countries. Carpano [1929] originally described ruffl- ed feathers, fever, loss of appetite, drowsi- ness, paralysis and death as symptomatic of the disease among the imported fowls in Egypt. A fatal form of toe disease was also reported by Donatien and Lesto- quard [1931] from Algeria, Gillain [1935] from Belgian Congo, Debonera [1933] from Greece and Yakimoff [1933] from the U. S. S. R. Coles [1933] described loss of appetite, dejection, diarrhoea and some- times icterus as symptomatic of the disease in young chickens which had become infected during the first few days of life. Paralysis and fever reported by Carpano [1929] as characteristic of the disease were not noticed by the writer. The factors governing the pathogeni- city of A, pullorum do not appear to be properly understood, but age and immuni- ty, possibly due to contact with A. persi- cus seem to play some part in its deter- mination. Thus, fowls imported from countries free from Argas, and among them the younger birds, appear to suffer most. POST-MORTEM APPEARANCES The carcases of both the chickens showed similar anatomical changes. There was a well-marked thinness of muscles and general anaemia; the body cavity contained a slightly blood-tinged serous fluid and its walls were sparsely petechiated; the spleen was enlarged to about three times its normal size, its parenchyma being purplish in colour; the liver was also enlarged and appeared to be more friable; the pericardial sac con- tained a slightly blood-tinged fluid and the epicardium showed a few petechiae; and the alimentary canal showed nothing un- usual. Smears of heart blood showed numerous A. pullorum (86 per cent ery- throcytes were infected) and an almost similar infestation was found in smears from the lungs, liver and spleen. Poly- chromatia was noticeable in all the smears. Coles [1933] has mentioned icterus as one of the changes in his cases, but this change was not observed by the present writer. TREATMENT During the treatment of the first White Leghorn hen for spirochaetosis (supra) it was noticed that an intramus- cular injection of soamin (1.5 grain) did not have any effect on A. pullorum or Coles' haematozoon, although the treatment caused the disappearance of Spirochaeta anserinum. A second injection of soamin (1 grain) given to the same hen two days later also failed to have any effect. According to Hutyra, Marek and Man- ninger [1938], Stovarsol in doses of five centigrammes per os has a favourable effect on anaemia, although it does not kill the parasites (A. pullorum). Dona- tien and Lestoquard [1934] studied the effect of Stovarsol, Gonacrine, Trypan Blue and Icthargan on affected pullets. They found that Stovarsol was useful in cases of anaemia only and among the other drugs Icthargan was efficacious only after a second injection. In the hands of Curas- son [1938], however, two intra-muscular injections of Gonacrine gave the best results. On the whole, therefore, the position regarding the chemotherapy of aegyptianellosis must be regarded as unsatisfactory. SUMMARY 1. The occurrence of Aegytianella pullorum Carpano and of a haematozoon
M. ABDUSSALAM 21 esembling that described by Coles [1937] fowls has been recorded from northern ndia. 2. These haematozoa did not appear to et up any appreciable disease symptoms n the adult indigenous fowls or acclima- ized imported breeds. 3. In an attempt to experimentally ecover A. pullorum from naturally infect- d ticks (Argas persicus), two Leghorn chickens were exposed to the tick bites. These birds suffered from a mild attack of spirochaetosis on the 6th day and re- overed; on the 14th day they, however, howed A. pullorum in their peripheral lood. 4. The symptoms shown by infected chickens were a progressive anaemia and maciation, slight rise of temperature, lullness, diarrhoea and death in about four weeks' time. The main post-mortem indings were: the enlargement of the spleen and liver, petechiae on the serous membranes, slightly blood-tinged fluid in erous cavities and cachexia. 5. Coles' haematozoon did not appear set up any disease symptoms in fowls and circumstantial evidence showed that his organism was probably transmitted by in agency other than the fowl tick. 6. Soamin, in the usual doses employed for the treatment of spirochaetosis, was found to have no effect either on A. pul- orum or Coles' haematozoon. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The writer is indebted to Mr J. S.

(Agri.), A.R.I.C., Assistan to Agricultural Chemist to Government, Punjab, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 7 March 1944) THERE have been in the past and there still are to-day many prejudices amongst zemindars against using fuzzy American cotton seeds as a feeding stuff. These prejudices may briefly be summarized as follows: 1. Fuzzy cotton seed is low in fat in com- parison with naked seed, and conse- quently the output of ghee from buffa- loes fed on it is reduced. 2. This seed is considered to be indiges- tible or harmful to the digestive sys- tem of animals. 3. Fuzzy seed has a smaller kernel than other cotton seed and this reduces its nutritive value and adversely affects the fat content of the milk produced. 4. It reduces the quantity of milk secre- ted. 5. Some people go so far as to say that the teats of milch animals become clogged up if they are fed on this seed for any length of time. 6. Its food value is lower than that of other cotton seed. 7. Cattle do not relish the seed because of its fuzziness. Work has been carried out at Lyallpur in the past on heifers with various types of cotton seeds including the fuzzy American types.

From January to May, green berseem was fed and then till the end of the experiment, maize. The amount of bhusa given per day remained about the same. In addition to the above- mentioned roughages, all the animals were given as much cotton seed as they could eat together with 1 lb. of ground gram and 1 lb. of wheat bran per head per day. The four buffaloes in group A ate regularly approxi- mately 6 lb. per head per day of cotton seed throughout the period. Of the four buffa- loes in. group B, two ate 81b. of the delinted cotton seed (K25/289F American cotton seed) per head per day whilst the other two would not eat more than 4 lb. per head per day. The animals in group C ate up to 8 lb. of the seed per head per day on an average although animal No. 11 ate as much as 14 lb. of desi cotton seed per day for about six weeks. One animal in group C, No. 10, unfortunately deve- loped mammitis in November, 1942, and died on 16 January 1943, of toxemia. With this exception, all the animals main- tained normal weight with slight increase throughout the period under report. Their health was excellent and the milk yield in every case normal. All three types of cotton seed were soaked in water for half an hour or so before being fed. Comments on the nature of the ghee produced will be given later. A sample of ghee was made from the milk of each animal each month during the course of the experiment except April 1943, when the buffaloes were inoculated against T. B. The results of the analyses are shown in Table III. As a. result of these and previous inves- tigations the following conclusions may be drawn on the seven contentions mentioned above; 1. The statement regarding a lower fat content of fuzzy cotton seed is not correct, as may be seen from the statement of chemical analyses of the various cotton seeds (Table IV). There is no truth in this contention and the output of milk or ghee from buffaloes fed on fuzzy cotton seed was not reduced. 2. The fact has been deduced from these trials that fuzzy cotton seed is more digestible and contains more total digestible nutrients and more digesti- ble protein per 100 lb. of seed than naked cotton seed. 3. From what has been said above, this is obviously not true. 4. From the records of the milk yields, it will be seen that there is no truth in this contention. 5. In regard to this contention, one of the animals in group A suffered from slight mammitis for a short time but completely recovered, although the feeding regime remained the same. On the other hand, one of the animals in group C suffered and ultimately died from toxemia. Mammitis is not an uncommon occur- rence and may occur in any animal, and in this case appears to have had no traceable relationship with the ration. 6. It has already been pointed out that in these experiments the food value of the fuzzy cotton seed was higher than that of the other cotton seed, and not lower. This fact had pre- viously been ascertained by work on heifers and from the results of similar works carried out on milch cows recorded in the progress report of the scheme for studying the nutritional requirements of the milch cows in the Punjab for the year 1943. 7. This is entirely unsupported from the evidence gained in these experiments and previous work on milch cows and heifers.

Some people may still opine that the taking into an animal's digestive tract of a considerable amount of lint every day must be deleterious, but they overlook the fact that the animal's digestive system deals with it and digests it, and in any case the experimental animals definitely did not suffer in any way. The technical aspects relating to the ghee produced from the milk may be con- sidered under two headings: 1. The general impressions formed con- cerning the ghee produced from the milk of buffaloes fed on cotton seed by those who have used it. 2. The scientific data relating to the composition of the ghee in compari- son with the standard specifications laid down by Government. In regard to the quality of the milk, ghee and butter produced from the fuzzy cotton seed fed group, it has not been possible to distinguish, by consumption, any difference in taste or palatability from similar produce made from the milk of buffaloes fed different rations.

Eight members replied, and the general consensus of opinion ummarized in Table V shows that the thee from the fuzzy cotton seed fed ani- nals was preferred. The samples were espatched to certain parts of the country when the weather was becoming warm and in some cases the butter did not arrive n as sound a condition as might have been hoped for. This was perhaps the result of faulty packing. The balance of evidence was in favour of the fuzzy cotton seed. SCIENTIFIC DATA REGARDING THE GHEES Table III shows the complete analysis of the ghee made from the milk of the respective groups of animals throughout the year. In March 1943, a composite sample of ghee made from the milk of the animals of each of the three groups was sent to Sir Sorab Saklatvala of the Tata Oil Mils, Bombay. Their Chemist found that his Polenske values were somewhat lower than the corresponding Lyallpur figures. In this connection it is interesting to note the correlation which should exist between the Reichert Meissl values and the Polenske values as given on page 379 of Vol. II, Oils and Fats of Allen's Commercial Organic Analysis and the corresponding correlations in these values as seen from the Lyallpur analysis and the Tata analysis respectively. The analysis of the ghee sent showed certain deviations from the Government specifications, which have been kept within rigid limits to safeguard the public. There appeared to be nothing in the ana- lytical figures to show that the ghee made from the milk of the fuzzy and naked cotton seed fed groups of animals depart from normal to any extent which would constitute an argument against either. Summing up, these trials have shown that the prejudice against fuzzy cotton seed is unfounded, and the buffaloes fed on the rations indicated did not suffer on that account (the animal which died was a desi cotton seed fed animal) and neither the quantity nor quality of the milk or ghee depart from normal to any extent which could cenceivably be held to be an objection. This evidence, and the published record of previous work on cows with cotton seed and cotton seed cake should be brought to the notice, in some authoritative way, of the zamindar com- munity in India. The authors wish to take this oppor- tunity of thanking the Indian Central Cotton Committee for providing the funds for this work. REFERENCES Lander, P. E. and Dharmani, Lal Chand (1929). Mem. Dep. Agric. India Chem. 10, No. 6 PROTEINS FOR CHICKENS By A.J. MACDONALD and S. BOSE, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 20 June 1944) IN earlier experiments, Macdonald [1943] concluded that meat offal (intes- tines) can be used as an effective sub- stitute for milk in the ration of chickens. As in many parts of the country separat- ed and other milk products are relatively expensive, it was decided to carry out a further comparison in order to test the relative values of meat offal and sep- arated milk. As cereal diets without pro- tein supplements normally result in high mortality when fed to young chickens, and, as in previous experiment, a cereal diet supplemented with salt, green food and calcium gave comparatively low mortality, the new experiment was designed to throw more light on the value of common salt in the diet of birds fed on low protein diets. METHODS Stock. A total of 296 White Leghorn X Rhode Island Red chickens hatched in November 1942 were divided into four comparable groups and fed on the experi- mental diets for a period of 20 weeks. Feeding. All the birds were fed on a basal mash consisting of wheat bran 50 parts, yellow maize meal 30 parts and ground oats 20 parts. During the first eight weeks, the birds were fed a grain ration of equal parts maize, jowar and cheena. From 8-20 weeks the grain ration consisted of equal parts yellow maize, wheat and paddy. The grain was fed at 7 a.m. and 4-30 p.m. throughout the ex- periment. Broken limestone was supplied ad libitum and succulent green food (ber- seem) was fed liberally once daily during the whole experimental period. The mash was fed daily in a wet, crumbly state according to appetite at 9 a.m., 12 noon and 3 p.m. Group I was fed the basal ration only. Group II received the same ration as Group I with the addition of 1 per cent common salt to the mash. Group III was fed the basal mash plus 0.5 per cent salt and the mash made up with separated milk instead of water. Separated milk was also given ad libitum during the first 12 weeks, whilst separated milk and water in separate containers were supplied from 12-20. weeks. Group IV was fed the basal mash plus 1 per cent common salt and meat offal (cleaned intestines from the slaughter house). The amount of meat offal fed was regulated, so that the pro- tein content of the ration was approxi- mately the same as that fed to the birds receiving separated milk (Group III). The quantity of meat offal required every day was cooked for one hour in a small quan- tity of water and run through a mincing machine prior to mixing with the mash. The minced meat offal and the liquid resi- due after cooking were mixed with the re- quired daily amounts of mash and equal quantities were fed at each time of feeding. Rate of growth. The chickens were weighed individually at fortnightly inter- vals. The average weights of the males and females from 1-9 weeks and the females from 11-21 weeks are given in Table I. The cockerels were removed from the experiment at the end of the second period (9 weeks). 28

Total 24.99 14.91 2.7 4.05 The general health of the birds in Groups I and II as judged by handling and appearance was consistently poorer than that of Groups III and IV. The general health of the birds in Groups III and IV was consistently good throughout the experiment. The total mortality per- centages in Groups I and II were much higher, being 24.99 and 14.91 respectively, while the corresponding figures for Groups III and IV were 2.7 aud 4.05 respec- tively. DISCUSSION The rate of growth of the birds in both the groups without protein supplements was very much lower than that of the two groups receiving the protein supplements. The slow rate of growth in Groups I and II was most marked during periods 1 and 2 (1-9 weeks), so in the period when the demand for protein is at a maximum. The food utilization figures for the non-protein supplemented groups during periods 1 and 2 were much inferior to those in the corresponding periods for the protein supplemented groups. Throughout the whole experiment the general health and appearance of the birds in Groups I and II were much inferior to those of Groups III ahd IV. The mortality in all groups was low until the end of the second period. As would be expected with chickens reared under good environmental conditions, no death occurred in the protein supple- mented groups for 9-21 weeks. On the other hand, Groups I and II both suffered substantial mortality from nine weeks on- wards. The low mortality in Groups I and II during the initial eight weeks of the experiment period seems rather surprising in view of the low protein content of the ration. The low mortality during this period can partly be attributed to all the birds having received well balanced rations for one week prior to commencing the experiment. Further- more, during this period of eight weeks, the birds were well protected against the weather and thus did not receive any further check except that imposed by the diets fed. From 9-21 weeks, however, all the groups were placed outside in houses which were more exposed to weather conditions and this, in addition to the cumulative effect of deficient feeding in
32 A. J. Macdonald and S. Bose the case Groups I and II, resulted in a certain amount of mortality. The results obtained with the low pro- tein diet in this experiment as regards rates of growth, food utilization and mor- tality are very much better than those reported by Macdonald [1941] on a simi- lar low protein diet. In this experiment, however, the birds received a good initial diet from 0-1 week and it is very probable that this good start might have exerted a very beneficial influence on the subsequent behaviour of the chicks. The rate of growth and food utilization figures for Groups I and II were very similar. Whilst Group II had lower mortality than Group I, it would be unsafe to conclude from this that the addition of salt lowered mortality, since both groups were similar in appearance at all stages. The failure of the addition of salt to give any response is somewhat surprising in view of the proved value of salt supple- ments in rations containing only vegetable proteins. Mitchell and Carman [1926] demonstrated that the addition of common salt to a diet mainly composed of maize greatly improved its value. Prentice and Baskett [1932] and Prentice [1933] found that salt was very beneficial in the diet of chickens. Robertson, Orr, Prentice and Macdonald [1930] demonstrated that a supplement of salt was very beneficial in diets containing vegetable proteins only. In this experiment, however, the protein level of the ration was lower than that in the experiments reviewed here. Further- more, the liberal feeding of berseem, which is relatively rich in both sodium and chlo- rine, should have helped to make good any deficiency of both sodium and chlorine in the cereals. Robertson, Orr, Prentice and Macdonald [1930] also reported the beneficial value of clover in a vegetable protein diet containing no salt supple- ment. During the major part of the experi- ment, the chickens on the separated milk diet were slightly heavier than those of the meat diet. On the other hand, the mea group made on the average slightly better utilization of the food consumed. As it previous work, Macdonald and Bose [1943] obtained slightly better growth results from meat offal, further exper ments will have to be carried out prior to making any final conclusion in regard to the relative values of separated milk and meat offal in the diet of growing chick As the unit of protein in meat offal normally cheaper than that in separate milk it is, however, safe to conclude that meat offal could often be profitably use in place of milk in the diet of chikens. CONCLUSIONS (1) A mixed cereal diet with a protein content of 10.8 per cent plus liberal amounts of green food and calcium unsatisfactory for growing chicken especially in the early stages of growth. (2) Little or no benefit is derived supplementing the above diet with commo salt. (3) Separated milk and meat offal a valuable protein supplements for chicken (4) Meat offal can often be used ve profitably as a substitute for separate milk in the diet of chicks.

(Received for publication on 31 July 1943) INTRODUCTION MILK, which is a valuable human food, provides a favourable medium for the growth of micro-organisms. The Bacte- ria on entering the milk multiply at a rapid rate if the temperature is favour- able to them, and bring about undesirable chemical changes, as a result of which the keeping quality of the milk is consider- ably impaired. It, therefore, becomes imperative to take proper precautions against its contamination from all pos- sible sources during handling. One of the most common sources of contamination of milk is the utensil used in its produc- tion and handling, if it is not properly cleaned and sterilized. Rowlands [1934] has shown that ropiness in milk can be spread by churns (large milk cans) which are not properly sterilized. Barkworth [1941] has given the following figures indicating the extent of contamination of good quality milk through dirty churns: Milk in the bucket .. 12,000 bacteria per ml. Same milk in churn (dirty) . . 9,900,000 34 Sanitizing Dairy Utensils Recently a product known as Bentonite (a kind of clay) was brought on the market, and it was claimed for it that it was a useful detergent for cleaning dairy utensils and cheaper* than washing soda. When Bentonite was tested in the labor- atory it was found to give alkaline reaction to phenolphthalein and contained traces of carbonates as indicated by the slight effervescence it gave with hydro- chloric acid and appearance of white tur- bidity when barium chloride solution was added to clear water extract of Bentonite. The following composition of Bentonite was supplied by the firm: Moisture 15.36 percent. Ignition loss 7.24 Z. E. KOTHAVALLA, M. S. PHERWANI AND E. V. SESHACHARYULU 35 (i) Cans. To start with all the cans were thoroughly cleaned with wash- ing soda and then steam-sterilized for five minutes along with their lids. The initial cantamination of these cans when examined bacterio- logically showed that their plate counts varied from 100 to 400 and the coliform organisms were absent in one ml. of the rinsed out solution in all the trials. A measured quantity of raw milk was then put into each of these cans and kept overnight to curdle. The rest of the procedure adopted in cleaning the cans by the different methods was the same as that followed in the case of bottles excepting that the cans and their lids were steam sterilized for four minutes after cleaning with washing soda and Bentonite. Sterile coconut coir was used for scrubbing the cans. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION (i) Bentonite. Plate counts showed 56,000 bacteria per gram of Bentonite. (ii) Mixture of mud and cow-dung cake ash. The bacterial counts varied from 12 to 15 millions per gram of the mixture (mud and cow-dung cake ash) used. (iii) Tap water. The tap water used for washing the bottles and cans gave 640 colony counts per ml. (iv) Bottles and cans. The technique employed for determining the bac- terial counts of bottles and cans was the same as that suggested by Mat- tick and Hoy [1937] with the excep- tion that saline solution was used instead of Ringer's solution for rins- ing the utensils. In the case of cans 100 ml. of saline water were used for rinsing. Presumptive coliform test was done by introducing one ml. of the rinsed out solution into 10 ml. of MacConkey's bouillon. The maximum, minimum and average counts of bottles and cans and the number of trials in eah case falling between diffe- rent ranges of counts are give in Table I. DISCUSSION The foregoing results show that the bacterial counts of the bottles treated with washing soda and Bentonite are not much different and they are less than those of the bottles cleaned by the indig- enous method. The counts of the bottles cleaned by the indegenous method are less than those of the controls. With the washing soda the counts of the bottles range from 0 to 190, with an average count of 95, and from 150 to 280, with an average count of 226, in the cases of 1 lb. and 2 lb. bottles respectively. The bac- terial counts of bottles cleaned with Ben- tonite vary from 0 to 190, the average count being 85, in the case of 1 lb. bottles and from 150 to 280, with an average count of 230, in the case of 2 lb. bottles. The counts of the bottles obtained by the indigenous method range from 130 to 2,000, with an average count of 504 in the case of 1 lb. bottles and from 1,100 to 4,700, the average count being 3,034 with 2 lb. bottles. The plates count of the con- trol bottles vary from 2,000 to 50,000 with an average count of 9,410 with 1 lb. bottles and from 5,300 to 75,000, with an average count of 18,069, in the case of 2 lb. bottles. Coliform is absent in all the trials with washing soda and Bentonite, but in the case of indigenous method it is present in 11 trials with 1 lb. and 2 lb. bottles. All the controls show positive test for coliform. The American Standard Methods [1939] recommend a maximum of 1, 000 colonies per quart (American) bottle and of 500 per pint bottle, whereas Mattick and Hoy [1937] suggested that 200 organisms per pint bottle should be the standard. All the results with 1 lb, and 2 lb. bottles cleaned with washing soda and Bentonite therefore attained these standards. In the case of indig- enous method 16 trials with 1 lb. bottles attained American standards and only six trials came up to the standard proposed by Mattick and Hoy. All the trials with 2 lb. bottles cleaned by the indigenous method and the controls, however, failed to attain these standards.

SESHACHAYULU 37 The results with brass tinned and un- tinned cans also show that there is prac- tically no difference between the two treatments, i. e. washing soda and Bentonite and these two are much super- ior to the indigenous method. The bac- terial counts of the cans cleaned with washing soda range from 300 to 2,000, the average count being 1,094 with brass tinned cans and 1,161 with untinned cans. The counts of the cans cleaned with Ben- tonite vary from 100 to 2,000, the average count being 1,138, with brass tinned cans and 1,166 with untinned cans. The cans cleaned by the indigenous method show counts ranging from 700 to 14,000, the average count being 4,666 and 6,083 with tinned and untinned cans respectively. The counts of the control cans vary from 6,200 to 380,000, the average count being 130,122, with tinned cans and 1,55,472 with untinned cans. Coliform is absent in all the trials with washing soda and Bentonite. In the case of the indigenous method however coliform is positive in 8 and 11 trials with tinned and untinned cans respectively. All the controls show positive test for coliform. Tbe primary need for clean and sterile utensils for the safe handling of milk has already been emphasized. The results of the present investigation show that Ben- tonite in its cleansing efficiency stands on a par with washing soda when used under conditions described above. The indigenous method although better than the controls is inferior to either washing soda or Bentonite, the reason being that the mixture of mud and cow-dung cake ash, used for cleaning, is initially laden with a high number of bacteria and it is not possible to destroy a majority of these organisms, especially the spore formers, by exposing the utensils only to sunlight. The results also indicate that for cleaning milk utensils washing soda may success- fully be replaced by Bentonite which is cheaper than the former. The other ad- vantages of Bentonite observed during the course of the experiment are that it has no caustic effect on the hands of the worker, no abrasive action on metals and it is not hygroscopic. The utensils clean- ed with Bentonite also gave as clean and polished an appearance as those with washing soda. Again since it is in a powder form it can very easily be handled. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS They are as follows: (a) The comparative efficiency of wash- ing soda, Bentonite and indigenous, method in sanitising milk utensils has been studied. (b) There is practically no difference in the bacterial counts of the bottles and cans cleaned with washing soda and Bentonite. (c) The indigenous method although much better than the controls is in- ferior to washing soda and Bento- nite in its cleansing efficiency (as the plate counts show). (d) Bentonite is as good as washing soda in its cleansing efficiency and may, therefore, be successfully used in place of washing soda, being cheaper than the latter, for cleaning milk utensils. (e) Bentonite has several other advant- ages over washing soda such as:38 Sex Recognition in Indian Carp Mattic, A. T. R. and Hoy, W. A. (1937).

Punjab and AMJUD HUSSAIN, B.Sc. (HONS.) Assistant Warden of fisheries (Received for publicatio on 7 February 1944) IN order to determine sex from the ex- ternal features of Indian carp, Mookerjee [1938] made a study of 100 specimens of Labeo rohita and 36 specimens of Cirrhina mrigala from local markets in Calcutta and obtained the following results: Labeo rohita (1) the pectoral fin is either greater than or equal to the anal fin in the male, (2) the pectoral fin is less than the anal fin in female, (3) the area around the anal opening of breeding individuals appear reddish and swollen in the female but not in the male. Cirrhina mrigala: (1) the pectoral fin is greater than the anal one in the male, (2) the pectoral fin is equal to the anal one in the female. These tests when used as a means of differentiating the sexually mature male and the female of these two species in the Punjab gave somewhat different result from those obtained by Mookerjee. Ninety-six Labeo rohita and 110 Cirrhina mrigala were studied at Chhenawan and Lyallpur fish farms. Their sexes and weights were noted and measurements in mm. of their total length and length of the head and of all the fins and girth were re corded. The length of the fin was measu red from the commencement of its base to its farthest point along its longest ray (i) Pectoral and anal fins. In Labeo rohita, out of 96 specimens studied, 39 were males and 57 females. In all the males the pectoral fins were greater that the anal. Among the females, 11 speci mens had their pectoral fins shorter that the anal, in 5 they were equal to the anal and in 41 greater than the anal. In 2 of these 41 specimens, the difference be tween the lengths of the pectoral and ana fins was 5 mm. or more, and the measure ments of these specimens are given in Table I (iii) (Females).

Similarly Cirrhina mrigala, with one or two exceptions, the same rule applied (Table III). Such special development of pectoral fins in the males of Crypinidae has been attributed by some write [Cunningham, 1900] to special exertio of the organs during the breeding season In the Indian carp, too, during breeding season the male is always far more active than the female which, due to heaving ladden ovaries, is always sluggish in movements on such occasions.

V. R. RAJAGOPALAN AND M. ISRAIL 43 These observations, therefore, show at: (1) Both in Labeo rohita and Cir- rhina mrigala: (i) when the pectoral fin is less than or equal to the anal the specimen is always a female; but a female may also have pectoral fins greater than the anals; (ii) when the pectoral fins are greater than the anal, the specimen may be a male or a female, but in the male the pectoral fins are always greater than the anals; (2) In Labeo rohita in the females, the pectoral fins though they may be greater than the anals, are always less developed than the pectorals of the males for the same length of fish. The same rule, with a few exceptions, applies to Cirrhina mrigala too. Thus, given the same lengths of fish, it is easy to distinguish male and female in both these species, but in other cases it is rather difficult to do so, except in the breeding season when the females have bulging bellies due to the presence of ova in the ovaries and can easily be re- cognised. The results obtained by Mookerjee [1938 1 and 2] are, therefore, not of universal application and it would be interesting to know if the two species of carp namely Labeo rohita and Cirrhina mrigala show similar variations with regard to the pectoral and anal fins in other parts of India as those observed in the Punjab.

Five types of equine streptococci were found by them and the distribution of these types in various infections was indicated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Of the 39 strains studied 11 were receiv- ed from Major W.P.S. Edwards, R. A. V. C., who had isolated them from strangles abscesses in India. Six strains were isola- ted by us from material obtained by Srinivasan and Choudhury (article in press) at Mukteswar, viz. from deep swabs from the nostrils and from pus of fresh submaxillary abscesses. Two strains were isolated by Mr Shirlaw from orchitis in donkeys. Ten strains, repre- senting types 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Bazeley. and Battle [1940], were received in a dried state from Mr Bazeley of the Common- wealth Serum Laboratories, Australia. They had been isolated from fresh or previously opened strangles abscesses and from respiratory catarrh. Ten were our own laboratory strains from cases of strangles. A few of the strains mention- ed above were from sources other than strangles but they were included in order to determine their type. With all materials purity tests were first made on blood agar and represen- tative colonies identified by biochemical tests. Stock cultures were kept on blood agar slants under paraffin. Haemolysis tests were made on 5 per cent sheep-blood agar, observations being made before and after refrigeration. Fermentation tests were made in peptone water containing 1 per cent horse serum and Andrade indi cator, 1 per cent of the 'Sugar' being added from an autoclaved solution. Incubation was for seven days and seeding was heavy from an actively growing culture. The final pH in 1 per cent glucose broth [Avery and Cullen, 1919] was made after three days. The methylene blue reduction test was made much according to the technique of Edwards [1933], the medium being beef infusion containing 10 per cent casein digest, 1 per cent peptone and medicinal methylene blue to give final concentration of 1 : 100,000. The medium was seeded from an actively growing culture and examined after 24 hours at 37° C. Growth in bile salt was tested according to Belenky and Popowa [1929], viz. on blood agar plates containing 10 and 40 per cent sodium taurocholate. Hydrolysis of so dium hippurate was tested by the method of Ayers and Rupp [1922]. Serological Group differentiation by precipitation tests was made according to Lancefield [1928] and type differenti ation by slide agglutination tests according to Bazeley and Battle (loc. cit.) Sera were from rabbits which had received at five day intervals eight injections of carefully heat-killed young streptococcus culture, as advised by Bazeley and Battle. Suspensions for agglutination tested were made as follows: Overnight culturel in tryptic digest broth, containing varying quantities of horse serum up to 5 per cent were centrifuged and the deposit suspended in saline with 1: 10,000 merthiolate. Sera unabsorbed and absorbed with heterologous strains, were diluted to give specific agglu tination in 20 seconds. Equal-sized drop of serum dilution and suspension were placed side by side within 1 in. squares of glass plates, run together, rocked and the time for agglutination noted. RESULTS All strains belonged to Lancefield group C, were V. R. RAJAGOPALAN AND M. ISRAIL 45 ferment mannitol, lactose, trehalose and orbitol. Type 2 ferment lactose and orbitol; type 3 only sorbitol but not actose; and type 4 are trehalose fermen- ers. Type 4 can also be differentiated rom types 1, 2 and 3 by the ability of the ormer to reduce methylene blue and to ow in the presence of bile salts. Dif- erences in colony structure [Bazeley and Sattle, 1940] also proved helpful. Colonies of type 1 strains (Str. equi) were most distinctive, surface colonies having a zone of clear haemolysis with a very narrow eripheral zone of partial haemolysis. Colonies were mucoid, transparent and homogeneous, drawing to a thread when touched by a loop. Adjacent colonies had a tendency to coalesce. The haemolytic- zone in this type was biggest in relation to the size of the colony. Differences between colonies of types 1, 2 and 4 were! not sufficiently distinctive to enable one to place them definitely in their respective types without reference to biochemical tests. As a rule, colonies of streptococci of types 2 and 3 had a larger haemolytic zone than those of type 4. Type 4 colonies were granular and opaque, had a central opaque nucleus and portions of the colony were buried in the medium. Type 3 colo- nies were relatively transparent, as also were the margins of those of type 2.

The six strains isolated from nasal discharge and freshly opened submaxillary abscesses of cases of strangles in this Institute, belonged to type 4. Of the ten strains in stock and isolated between 1923 and 1931, 8 had been isolated from strangles pus; of these, one was type 2, one type 4 and the other six fell outside Bazeley and Battle's classifica- tion. Of these six strains, five somewhat resembled variants of type 2 strains of Ochi and Hirao [1940], as also was the case with Edwards' mannite-fermenting strains. The sixth resembled the first variant from type 1 strains of the same workers. DISCUSSION Bazeley and Battle found that strains isolated from freshly opened strangles abscesses were exclusively Str. equi and this conforms with the findings of most other workers. But it was remarkable that all the strains isolated from freshly opened sub-maxillary abscesses in the out- break, clinically diagnosed as strangles at this Institute, were cently isolated strains from cases of strangles forwarded by Edwards were also type 4; only one was Str. equi, two were type 2 and two others were probably variants of type 2. Haddow and Iyer [1939], who examined 31 strains from cases of strangles, found 9 only which conformed to the description of Str. equi. The paucity of true Str. equi (i. e. non-lactose fermenter), the finding of type 4 in one outbreak to the exclusion of all other types, and the general preponder- ance of types other than Str. equi among strains isolated from cases of strangles in India call for some comment. If the strains had been isolated from abscesses opened several days previously, the pre- ponderance of types 4 and 2 might be ex- plained on the analogy of the findings Bazeley and Battle [1940]. But, though we have no data on this point regarding Edwards' strains, we know that the Institute strains, which were all exclusive ly type 4, were obtaind from freshly opened abscesses. We have been accustomed so far to consider 'strangles' as a specific disease caused by Str. equi. In view of the find ings reported in this article, and in accord ance with the definition put forward by Minett [1944] 'strangles' may have to be accepted as a term used in a clinical sense to a disease of horses and mules involving the upper respiratory tract, frequently accompanied by suppuration of gland about the throat and caused by haemolyting streptococci belonging to Lancefield' serological group C though not necessarily of the same biochemical and serological type. Admittedly, the number of strains use in this study is small, and it may not be possible to draw general conclusions. But these findings call for the detailed study of a sufficiently large number of Indian strains from animals whose clinical his tory is known. SUMMARY Thirty -nine strains of streptococci from equine sources have been classified accord ing to the method of Bazeley and Battle [1940]. Seventeen of these were recently isolated from cases of strangles in India Contrary to expectation, only one of the seventeen strains was Str. equi., while 1 belonged to type 4 of the authors named Six strains from one outbreak belonged to type 4, two others were type 2 and two were possibly variants of type 2.

IV Nymphal stage. On 25-8-38 about 100 nymphs were placed on a goat and an equal number on a hill bull. They fed on the goat for 6 to 12 days, most leaving the host after seven and eight days. Nearly half the number placed on the bull were lost accidentally and of the rest most left the host after eight days, but one individual remained attached for 15 days. A total of 153 adults from both groups emerged after 28 to 34 days, comprising of 63 males and 90 females. V Adult stage. Observations on the parasitic period of the adult stage were not carried out in continuity of the above experiments, but were made at a later date only on goats. About 14 adults were observed which dropped off as follows: two on day eight, one on day nine, four on day 10 and seven on day 12. SUMMARY Haemaphysalis bispinosa was reare easily on goats and hill-bulls. The oviposi tion period was 7 to 15 days and the perid of survival of the female after oviposition ceased was three to six days. The duration of egg-stage was on an average 30 day Larvae were fully engorged in 4 to days. Nymphs remained attached for to 12 days, in exceptional cases for 15 day The parasitic period of the adult was from 8 to 12 days. The larval and nymph periods (non-parasitic), counting from the date of engorgement, were 17 to 25 and to 34 days, respectively at 22°C. Of 15 adults, 63 were males and 90 females.

HASHMI, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 30 August. 1944) As is well-known, bacillary white diar- rhoea or more correctly 'pullorum disease' has assumed serious proportions in many countries, the increase in incidence running parallel with the progress in artificial incubation and baby chick traffic. Cooper and Naik [1931], from an outbreak in the United Provinces, isolated a microorganism which they typed as S. gallinarum. (S. pullorum is now classed as a variant of S. gallinarum.) Naidu [1938] reported its occurrence in large number of fowls from Mysore state. As the poultry industry is rapidly developing in India and as a few farms have actually started the production and supply of artificially-hatched baby chicks, an extensive súrvey of the country was undertaken to find out the incidence of this disease. State and Provincial Poultry Disease Officers also cooperate by undertaking similar surveys within their areas. EXPERIMENTAL For the detection of pullorum-infecte fowls the rapid whole-blood stained-antige test, as described by Schaffer, Macdonld Hall and Bunyea [1931] and used be English and American workers, was em ployed with slight modifications. Thre authentic strains of S. pullorum, from the Veterinary Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture in England, were incorpora ed in the antigen prepared for the test A drop of blood from the wing vein the snipped comb was mixed on a glas plate with an equal quantity of the stan dardized antigen (a thick, stained an killed saline suspension of S. pullorum
S. G. IYER AND Z. A. HASHMI 49 Clumping (agglutination) of bacteria occurred in a minute or two if the blood was from an infected fowl, otherwise the mixture remained uniformly homogeneous. This test is rather delicate, but is parti- cularly useful under field conditions. The birds examined were all mature and most of them from breeding stock. They belonged to 23 poultry farms, spread over U. P., Bihar, Orissa, Mysore and Punjab. These farms are all organized and run on progressive lines (artificial ncubation, etc.) and should thus cons- tute the probable foci of infection if any were present. In all, 3798 birds were tested but none of them was found to be infected. In addition, the Poultry Dis- ease Officers of Mysore, C. P., Madras, Bengal and Assam examined a further number of 1219 birds. Out of these, only 11 birds from Mysore (Hebbal Farm) gave doubtful reactions, the rest reacting negatively. Bunyea and Macdonald [1941] Holm, William, Callahan and Halversen [1940] and Johnson and Pollard [1940] described certain conditions leading to false or non-specific reactions with this test. Materials from the suspicious re- actors were therefore submitted to more detailed laboratory examination, but all proved negative for S. pullorum infec- tion. These results suggest that pullorum disease is of no great significance at pre- sent to the poultry industry in this coun- ry. This apparent freedom is probably due to the absence of commercial hatch- ries engaged in baby chick traffic. In view of the fact that the disease has been esponsible for enormous losses in other arts of the world, it is essential that very possible effort should be made to ocate and stamp out any possible source of infection, so as to prevent its spread throughout the country. Careful vigilance by the livestock departments with periodic surveys of areas under their jurisdiction and the education of all concerned in the diagnosis and control of the disease should therefore form an integral part of their poultry improvement plans. It is also suggested that all imported birds should be tested prior to their inclusion in the stock, so as to prevent the introduction of the disease into the country. SUMMARY A total of 5017 adult fowls were tested for pullorum disease by the quick ag- glutination method with completely nega- tive results, save in the case of 11 birds which gave suspicious reactions. A more de- tailed examination of these birds did not show pullorum infection. The birds inclu- ded in this survey were mostly from or- ganized poultry farms, situated in U.P., Bihar, Orissa, Punjab, Mysore, C.P., Madras, Bengal and Assam. The survey was therefore well-distributed and repre- sentative.

A CASE REPORT OF BOVINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AT THE BENGAL VETERINARY COLLEGE HOSPITAL By A. MUKERJI, B. Sc., G. V. Sc., Laboratory Assistant, Bengal Veterinary College, Calcutta (Received for publication on 6 March 1944) THE object of this paper is to place on record the occurrence of Encephalomyeli- tis in a cow in the Bengal Veterinary College Hospital during the month of November, 1943. INTRODUCTION Borna disease (Syn:A. MUKERJI 51 aemorrhages and the cerebrospinal fluid both in the meningeal spaces and the ventricles of the brain appeared to be clear and increased in amount. The gas- tro-intestinal tract showed inflammatory changes. Microscopical examination of mears from different organs of the body yielded negative result, and an attempt at cultivating bacteria from the brain proved futile. Smears from hippocampus was examined and found to be negative for Negri bodies. Pieces of brain and spinal cord fixed in 75 per cent alcohol were sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, for histo-patho- logical examination and the following re- port was received: "The specimen from the cow revealed extensive degeneration of the nerve cells and very marked peri- vascular cuffing on microscopical ex- amination. These changes are indicative of encephalomyelitis'. The above findings confirmed the result of the following transmission experiments conducted in the College Laboratory.

The duodenal mucosa was in- med, thickened and oedematous. The rface was studded with small immature arasites, of a size varying from that of a stard seed to that of a small melon ed. Acute catarrhal enteritis was resent. This was most prominent in the rst foot of the duodenum beyond which e lesions became gradually less intense. he walls of the large intestines showed ery few calcified nodules, but in their men a small number of Oesophagosto- um columbianum was found. The few rongyle ova detected in the faeces were robably of this species of worm. No ukes were met with in the gall-bladder bile ducts, although the liver showed tty changes. As regards the other organs, nothing eyond a pallidity, probably caused by the ss of blood, could be detected. HISTOPATHOLOGY A sectional study of the duodenum Plate III, fig. 2) revealed an acute catarr- al enteritis, with a cellular infiltration. A ngitudinal section of the immature worm Plate III, fig. 2) was seen in the submuc- us area and its well-developed acetabulum closing a piece of the mucous tissue dicated considerable irritation caused by these immature worms. OBSERVATION The mature worms obtained from the umen were examined and mostly found to e Cotylophoron cotylophorum and a very ew Fischoederious elongatus. No other elminths were met with in the rumen. he immature worms from the duodenum also appeared to be Cotylophoron cotylo- horum, though it is obviously dangerous attempt an identification of any worm, articularly of amphistomes, at the im- ature stage. These immature worms ere at different stages of develop- ent. Some had developed the intes- nal caeca, while in others were seen only the sexual primordia. In a few others, the genitalia could be distinctly traced, though they had not begun function- ing. The mature worms in the rumen had ova in their uteri and probably a few ova found in the faeces were from these worms. That the cause of the enteritis and death was due to these immature forms of Cotylophoron cotylophorum is quite apparent. The pond or tank around which the goats grazed was examined to ascertain its moliuscan fauna and larval trematodes. The molluses met with were Indoplanorbis exustus, Limnea leuteola and Vivipara bengalensis, of which only the Indoplanor- bis exustus was found to discharge cercariae which resembled Cercariae in- dicae XXVI (Sewell, 1922), while the other two molluscs were free from any infesta- tion. It is possible that these cercariae may be the larval forms of the amphis- tomes in question. The actual percentage of infection with the cercariae could not be determined, as the molluscs were already dying off owing to the scarcity of water in the tank on account of the hot weather. Further investigations on the determina- tion of the cercarial fauna of this area will be undertaken at a more propitious season. DISCUSSION There appears to exist considerable confusion with regard to the identity of the adult amphistome of Cercariae indicae XXVI (Sewell, 1922). Rao and Ayyar [1932] evolved the adults of these cercariae by feeding experiments and expressed the opinion that the adults obtained were Paramphistomum cervi. These authors had obtained only immature forms and based their diagnosis on these. The cerca- riae of Paramphistomum cervi, according to Bennett [1936], are lacking in the evagi- nations from the excretory canals, which formed a prominent feature in Cercariae indicae XXVI. Hence, it is doubtful if the adults obtained are not of Cotylophoron species. Bennett [1936] has described the cercariae of Cotylophoron cotylophorum in the life history studies on that trematode
56 Fatal Enteritis in Goats and concluded that Cercariae indicae XXVI (Sewell, 1922) is not the larval form. His description of the excretory system of the cercariae which he has found for the adult parasite agrees with that in Cercariae indicae XXVI. The differences noticed by him do not seem to justify his claim that it is different. I am of opinion that Bennett [1936] was actually dealing with Cercariae indicae XXVI (Sewell, 1922). Srivastava [1938] in the life history studies of Cotylophoron cotylophorum has mentioned the larval form of this parasite to be very similar to Cercariae indicae XXIX, though not identical with it. It has already been established by Rao and Ayyar [1932] and Vaidyanathan [1941] that the adults of these cercariae are Fischoederius elongatus belonging to a different genus altogether. Further, Cercariae indicae XXIX has been so far recorded only from Limnaea leuleola and not from Indopla- norbis exustus. Pande [1935] records an acute amphis- tomiasis of cattle in Assam caused by immature forms of Paramphistomum cervi. During a personal discussion with him, he expressed the opinion that the immature forms are probably of Cotylophoron species and that he was not convinced that they were of Paramphistomum cervi. Le Roux [1930] has dealt with two severe outbreaks of amphistomiasis due to Cotylophoron cotylophorum in sheep and goats. Chatterjee [1931] in his preliminary observations on the life history studies with Cercariae indicae XXVI recorded that the young forms developed in his experi- mental goats by feeding with the above cercariae were of Paramphistomum cervi; however, in a later communication, the same author [1938] changed his opinion and pointed out that the cercariae in question was the larval form of Cotylo- phoron cotylophorum. Thus there are more cases of amphis- tomiasis caused by immature forms of Cotylophoron species on record than by Paramphistomum cervi or any other amphistoma. There also appears to be concensus of opinion regarding the adult Cercariae indicae XXVI (Sewell, 1922). In the present instance the mortali among the goats has been presumed have been caused by immature forms Cotylophoron cotylophorum, since the on adults seen in the rumen were of the variety and the number of Fischoederi elongatus encountered (about six) w negligible. In the course of the routin post-mortem examination of ruminant the writer has found adults of Cotylopho ron species more frequently than Para phistomum species. Hence, the writer inclined to think that the incidence of the species Cotylophoron, at any rate in south India may be much more than that Paramphistomum, though further statis tical evidence of this is necessary. It hoped that such evidence will become available shortly. SUMMARY An outbreak of amphistomiasis among goats has been described from Madras and the cause has been provisionally determing ed to be the immature forms of Cotylo phoron cotylophorum.

Bhalerao for his help in the preparation of this paper, also to Mr Rajendran assistant to the Lecturer in Hygiene of the madras Veterinary College, for having placed at the disposal of the writer the material concerned in this outbreak.

A STUDY OF THE VITAMIN A AND CAROTENE CONTENT OF COW'S MILK DURING ONE COMPLETE LACTATION By DALIP SINGH, M.Sc. (PB.), Ph. D. (CANTAB.), Agricultural Chemist to Government Punjab, Lyallpur and FATEH MOHAMMAD, B.Sc. (Agri.). Chemical Assistant, Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 24 August 1944) THE importance of vitamin A as an essential ingredient of human diet cannot be over-emphasized. A regular supply of it the system is indispensable for the proper development and functioning of the body and as a preventive measure against usceptibility to disease. A number of orkers have made quantitative studies on the daily requirements of Vitamin A (or s precursor carotene) for various types of animals, for keeping them in good health. Thus, Ward, Bechdel and Guer- ant [1938] found that 12-18 microgrammes of carotene are required per lb. of body weight per day for growing dairy calves to prevent A avitaminosis. Converse and Meigs [1938] have deduced the carotene equirements of cows for normal reproduc- tion and calving to be 80-100 mg. daily during the last months of gestation; the amount below 60 mg. per cow per day resulting in a considerable proportion of till-born calves. Kuhlman and Gallup [1941] working with lactating cows of ersey breed arrived at the conclusion that 0-45 microgrammes of carotene per lb. of body weight (or 40-45 mg. for a 1,000 lb. animal) is about the minimum daily re- uirement for normal lactation. With amounts lower than 40 microgrammes, the lactation was likely to be impaired; the calves born were weak and the cows developed abnormal conditions. Similarly, it has been ascertained that about 4 mg. is the minimum daily dose for man. The most important source of supply of vitamin A for cattle is green roughage. Seshan and Sen [1942] have determined the carotene content of a large number of green roughages ordinarily fed in this country, and the amount of fodder neces- sary to meet the vitamin requirements of main types of animals can easily be calcu- lated. The problem of feeding cows, however, is somewhat different. As a milch animal, the cow requires vitamin A not only for her own system but also for secretion in milk which forms one of the important sources of vitamin A for the consumer. Studies on the relationship between the carotene content of the feed and that in the milk have been carried out by many workers. Moore [1932] has shown that in the cow carotene of the feed undergoes conversion to vitamin A and is secreted in the milk partly as carotene as such and partly as vitamin A. Kennedy and Dutcher [1922] demonstrated as early as 1922, that the vitamin-A value of milk is influenced by the vitamin-A value of the feed. Kraus [1931], Watson [1932] and others have shown that pasture grass is rich in vitamin-A factor and produces a milk of high vitamin-A activity. Recently a more quantitative study has been made of this problem. Hogdson and co-workers [1938] have found that the average percentage of the carotene ingested which was secreted as carotene in the butter fat was 0.71 for cows receiving hay, 0.22 for cows receiving hay and silage, and 0.12 for cows receiving silage only. Similarly, Bartlett and co-workers [1938] and Seshan and Sen [1942] arrive at the same con- clusion, viz. increased intake of carotene is followed by the increased carotene and vitamin-A potency of milk. The studies of Henry, Housten and Kon [1940] on the vitamin content of the first milk or colostrum have brought out its amazing richness in vitamin A and 57
58 Vitamin-A and Carotene Content of Cow's Milk carotene. They found colostrum to be 35 times richer in vitamin A and 65 times richer in carotene than the later milk. From this it appeared worthwhile to study the vitamin content of milk at different periods or stages during one complete lactation in the Sahiwal breed of cows. EXPERIMENTAL Five Sahiwal cows weighing about 800 lb. each, in their fourth lactation, were employed for this purpose. This experi- ment was started about two months after they had calved and so colosturm could not be included in this study. During the early part of the experiment, i.e. April and May 1942, these cows were on green berseem, and then from June to November when the experiment ended with the end of the lactation, they were on green maize, and these fodders were fed ad libitum, in addition to a quantity of the concentrate mixture of bran and cotton seed. A com- posite sample of morning and evening milk was taken daily for fat determination and the weekly estimation of vitamins. The estimation of carotene and vitamin A in milk was carried out according to the method of Willstaedt and With [1938] in which 100 c.c. of well-shaken milk is mixed with one tenth of its volume of 60 per cent KOH solution. The flask is filled with nitrogen, stoppered, and vigorously shaken, and kept aside for 48 hours with occasional shaking. After this cold saponification, 20 c.c. of alcohol is added, and the whole extracted with peroxide-free ethyl ether, extract washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the ether evaporated in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The residue is taken up in chloroform for vitamin A or in petroleum ether for carotene, and the colour compared in Lovibond Tintometer for blue and yellow values. The data obtained are given in Table I. The first two columns show intake of green fodder (average of the previous seven days) and carotene contained in it. Columns 3,4 and 5 give the total output of butter in grammes, carotene and vitamin A in milk grammes respectively, for each of the find cows. Now, turning to the column fo green fodder intake by each of the cow we find that, as these were allowed a much as they would eat, they consume between 60 and 100 lb. of berseem daily (upto 23-5-44), and later on when maiz was the only green roughage, the average daily consumption varied considerable with each cow going up to a maximum o 110 lb. The amount of carotene intake during the berseem period varied naturally with the amount of feed ingested and was bet ween 1520 mg. and 4950 mg. per day During the latter period (maize period the intake decreased considerably due to the fact that maize is not so rich it carotene as berseem, although the consump tion of the former was more or less the same. The output of carotene in milk was about 2 to 4 mg. daily, and this remained fairly constant for a considerable time practically throughout the period of lact ation except in cows No. 4 and 5 where i fell to a figure round about 1 mg. during the latter part of the lactation. The output of vitamin A, calculated from the blue units into milligrams accor ding to the formula given by Bartlett and co-workers [1938] has shown a great con stancy, although there was a considerable fall in the daily milk yield, thus indicating increase in vitamin A towards the end of the lactation. The vitamin secreted in milk forms a very small percentage of that ingested even in the case of cows which are provided with enough of green roughages. This shows that, whereas feeds which are defici ent in carotene will force the cow to deplete its reserves of vitamin A and ultimately lead to poorer milk, it is no possible to enrich it beyond a certain limit by feeding carotene-rich feeds. It is inter esting to observe that each of the cows has yielded during the entire lactation about as much vitamin A as is equivalent to its one

If milk were to be regarded as the only source of vitamin A for man, then, in order to ensure the vitamin in an optimum quantity of about 4 mg. one will have to consume daily as much as 300 to 400 gm. of butter. Green leafy vegetables are a very rich source of vitamin A, and it is possible to have carotene separated in the laboratory from other plant sources like pasture grass and mixed with butter in such a quantity that say an ounce of it contains the daily dose. The economic and technical aspects of this problem and the extent of deterioration with time of such vitaminized butter or ghee require investigation and some work is already under way in this direction in these laboratories.

It will be observed that this has been more or less constan over a considerable period, and it is to wards the very end of the lactation that the value has gone to a considerably high figure showing the increased richness of milk to wards the end of lactation. The caroten content has not shown a similar increase (per gram of fat) towards the end of lact ation.

The concentration of vitamin A has been fairly constant throughout the major rt of the lactation, but towards the end there is a sharp rise in the blue values. This is the period when milk deve- ps abnormalities in composition, like increased salt content. A glance at the carotene figures shows that in cows Nos. 1-3, the figures have gone up towards the end, but in cows 4-5, there is no such tendency. This shows the individual variability of the cow as a converter of feed carotene to butter carotene.

62 Rectal Temperatures of Animals at Rest ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors express their grateful thanks to Dr P.E. Lander, late Agricul- tural Chemist to the Government of Punjab, for initiating this piece of work. Their thanks are also due to Mr Lal Chand Dharmani, Assistant to the Agricultural Chemist, for providing necessary facilities and his valuable help in the course of the investigation. SUMMARY (1) A study of the vitamin A and caro- tene content of milk from five Sahiwal cows was made throughout their lactation. (2) The cows were on liberal green ration getting up to 4,000 mg. of carotene; but the daily output of vitamin A and carotene in milk was about 4-5 mg. only (3) Towards the end of the lactation there was a rise in the vitamin A a carotene content of the milk, although the total output, due to fall in the milk yield was not much affected.

SEN, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 17 October 1944) (With four text-figures) IN view of the variable and frequently high air temperatures in India and the effect of air temperature on body temper- ature of resting animals, it is important to have as precise knowledge as possible on the normal body temperature under different conditions. This is particularly so with relatively homothermous animals, i.e. onés whose heat regulation is less perfect than in man. LITERATURE The normal range of rectal temperature for various domesticated animals in health in temperate countries has been laid down by numerous observers. For animals in hotter countries there must be fewer records. To obtain an accurate idea of an animal's temperature important points are that the thermometer must be properly used and the observations repeated throughout the 24 hours. Lazarus-Barlow [1928] has shown with rabbits how incor- rect an impression may be formed of the normal swing of the body temperature unless observations are made at interva as short as, say four hours. Varrie Jones and Sims Woodhead [1915] devise a special apparatus by which the rect temperatures of cattle could be recorded mechanically and in a quasi-continuons manner. In this way they were able to show well-marked variations during the 24 hours. During most of the day the temperature lies between 101 and 102°F It is always highest during the day when the animal is standing or moving about has just been fed, and falls slow during the night to reach its minimum [100.7°F.] about 3-5 a.m. Milking almost always caused a slight rise. The higher points were at 8-9 a.m. and 4-6 p. m., the diurnal range being about 1.2°F. Woold ridge [1905] had likewise found that for cattle in Ireland the average morning and evening temperatures are 101.5 and 102°F. Hobday [1896] gives figures of 101.3 and 101.8°F. for cattle in England.
F. C. MINETT and S. SEN 63 With animals in hot countries the mat- er is somewhat different. As pointed out Hornby [1942], the expression 'normal temperature'. as applied to animals under such conditions, has only a provisional meaning. Regan and Freeborn [1936] found that high-producing Jersey cows kept at air temperature of 85°F. or over for more than 24 hours were unable to control their body temperatures. Regan and Richardson [1938] found that the rectal temperatures of cattle remained constant at 101-101.3°F. when the air tem- perature was between 40 and 70°F., above that it began to increase and at 100°F. the rectal temperature was 105.1°F. Although cattle native to hot countries are more tolerant of high air temperatures, princi- ples similar to those just enunciated hold good. Their normal resting temperatures do not however differ from cattle of cooler countries. For instance, Manresa and Gomez [1937] for cattle of the Nellore breed in the Philippines give a mean daily value of 38.66°C. (101.59° F.), the diurnal and nocturnal values being 38.7°C. (101.66°F.) and 38.56°C (101.4°F.). These figures were based on four-hourly readings taken over seven days in April. The values were lowest at 6 a.m. and highest at 6 p.m., while the diurnal values were said to be significantly higher than the octurnal (number of observations not stated). They too note a high and signi- icant correlation at the same hours of the lay between body temperature and air temperature. In a later paper by Manresa and Falcon [1939] for six mature Nellore cattle higher values are given, viz. average 39.01°C. (102.2°F.) during the hotter part of the year, March to July (average air emperature 28.22°C. or 82.8°F.) and average 38.82°C. (101.88°F.) during the ooler months64 Rectal Temperatures of Animals at Rest atures (3-5 p.m.) increased from 106.4 to 108.6ºF., so that the difference between the a.m. and p.m. averages at the highest air temperature was as much as 3.0º F. From two-hourly body temperature recordings, taken over periods when the average room temperature ranged from about 57 to 75ºF., it was shown that body temperatures were highest at 4 a.m, and lowest at mid- night (cf. Fronda above), the difference being about 1.5°F. The general finding therefore was that body temperatures increased and decreased in nearly direct relation to the air temperature. The greatest change in body temperature occur- red between 6 and 8 p.m., with a decrease of about 0.8ºF. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS The experiments were made on male buffaloes, cows of theHariana breed, sheep, goats and fowls at Izatnagar and on Kum- auni hill-bulls and sheep at Mukteswar. The animals selected appeared to be in reasonably good health, but a few troubles developed during the experiments. They were housed in sheds sheltered by trees and were not crowded. In winter some straw bedding was provided. They were watered and fed at times that would not interfere with the observations. The cattle were given an adequate ration; cows received a concentrated mixture usually containing ground-nut cake, rape-cake, wheat bran, gram husk, with mineral supplement, while the roughage consisted of hay or bhusa, fresh green fodder or silage according to the season. Buffaloes. got gram or cowpeas and maize or jowar with the concentrates. Hill-bulls got a ration similar to the cows, while the sheep and goats also got a suitable concentrate and roughage ration. With the cattle and buffaloes five series of observations lasting 10, 10, 13, 12 and 10 days were made in April, June, July, August and December 1941, the tempera- tures being recorded at 7 and 10 a.m., 1, 4, 7 and 10 p.m. and occasionally at 1 and 4 a.m. In April, July and December in case of buffaloes supplementary figures for 7 a.m. and 4 p. m. were taken from a other experiment. With sheep and goat at Izatnagar there were two series ea of five days in February and June 1942 and with fowls, two series each of three days in February and (end) May 1942 At Mukteswar hourly temperature obser vations extending over 24 hours were made on hill-bulls and sheep during July 1942. Dry-bulb temperatures were recor ded with a hygrometer suspended at the centre of the shed or room at about eight feet from the ground. The following details are necessary. Buffaloes. Five male Indian rive buffaloes of 'country' breed, 6-8 years old and weighing 950 to 1,100 lb. were used They were housed in a chapper open the sides. They were watered daily 7-30 a.m. and 3 p.m. and fed at 10-30 a.m. and 4-30 p.m. Slight exercise was given at 7-30 a.m. Two of them suffered from slight diarrhoea for a few days during the first experiment (April) and one of the had to be replaced before the next experi- ments. Cows. Five in number, ages in year 3, 4, 10, 11 and 14, body weights 870-1,10 lb. Two of them calved in February 1942 and were in milk during the first three experiments; before the fifth experiment (December) one of them went dry and two others had calved in September and October. They were tied in a shed, which was closed on three sides, except from to 10 a.m. when they were tied in the open. The only exercise was a short wal after 10 a.m. Watering was at 7-30 a.m. and 3 p.m.; feeding at 5 a.m. and 3. p.m. at which times they were milked. The air temperature in the shed was about the same as that in the buffalo-shed. All five remained in normal health, except that the youngest had a slightly raised tempere ature for 1½ days during the second experi ment. The third and fourth experiment (July, August) coincided with the monsoon and rain totalling 11.07 inches fell on nine of the 25 days in these experiments. The temperature of the rain water was 75-78°F. During the fifth experiment the other
F. C. MINETT and S. SEN 65 Cows of the milking herd were also oused in the shed from 2 p.m. to 7-30 m. Sheep (at Izatnagar). Ten male sheep of 'country' breed were used, all 1-1½ eárs old. At the first experiment their body weights were 36-44 lb. and at the second 44-60 lb. They were tied about 2- eet apart in a shed open on the east side. They had not been recently shorn; Goats. Ten were used in each series of experiments; before the second experi- ment (June) there were three replace- ments. Four were males and nine were females, and all but one were 1½ years old, me being four years old. At the first experiment their weights were 26-40 lb. and at the second 30-52 lb. They were oused with the sheep, and as with sheep water was offered after every tempera- ture-recording. Fowls. Nine cocks, 1 year old and about lb. in weight, were used, mostly White Leghorn-desi cross. They were kept in separate cages in a large laboratory, the doors and windows of which were kept open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the May experiment. Food and water were always available in the cage. Sheep (at Mukteswar). Nine sheep, 1-1½ years of age, were selected as being n reasonable health, though three of them ad 'snuffles'. They had been shorn eleven days before the experiment. They were kept untethered in a shed, the air temper- ature of which was maintained at 69- 4°F. Hill-bulls. Ten were used and they were housed in the shed which had been used for the sheep. The air temperature was maintained at 70-75ºF. They were watered three hours before the experiment was started and immediately afterwards. Hay was fed at 6 a.m. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS The personal factor in temperature-taking This is a matter, the importance of which cannot be too often stressed, especia- lly since the work is frequently placed in |the hands of uninstructed subordinates. The technique of individuals varies, both in respect of the time the thermometer is allowed to remain in the rectum and the depth to which it is inserted. In order to check up these points some experiments were arranged. In one of these, six obser- vers, all professionally qualified, were. engaged to take the temperatures of five cows and five buffaloes, one observer (F.C. M.) acting as control. None of the others was informed of the object of the experiment, but an instruction was given that the thermo- meter was to remain in the rectum for exactly one minute from the time it was considered to be in position. The obser- vers passed from one animal to another as quickly and as quietly as possible and no observer was aware of the readings of the others. All the thermometers were checked before use in water at 97º, 101ºand 104°F. and showed differences of not more than 0.2ºF. and usually not more than 0.1ºF. With the cows, the differences between the highest and lowest readings were: 1.3, 0.9; 0.2, 1.6, and 0.5ºF. (mean 0.9ºF.) and with the buffaloes 2.0, 1.2, 0.9, 1.1 and 1.4ºF. (mean 1.3ºF.). The differences bet- ween the highest and next lowest readings were 0.8, 0.7,0.l,0.9, 0.3ºF. (mean 0.56º F.) with cows and 1.4, 0.8, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8ºF. (mean 0.84º F.) with buffaloes. One observer gave almost consistently the lowest read- ings, obviously because he had not inser- ted the thermometer to its full depth. The next experiment was designed to show the effect of inserting the thermome- ter to different depths. Ten cows were used and most of the work was done by one observer. Differences from the true temperature (i.e. when thermometer was fully inserted) were 1. when little more than the bulb was inserted, range 0.3 to 1.5ºF. (mean 0.6F.), 2, when the bulb was inserted an extra cm.66 Rectal Temperatures of Animals at Rest TABLE I Body temperatures (ºF) of buffaloes, cows, sheep, goats and fowls Hour Mean Min. Max. A. T.

OBSERVATIONS Mean temperatures at various times of the day at different seasons The full data are too bulky for public- ation and are retained in the Record office of the Institute. Mean and range figures only are given in this paper. Table I shows the mean daily body tem- perature, minimum and maximum body temperatures, range of air temperature and the number of observations taken, for buffaloes, cows, sheep, goats and fowls at Izatnagar for different times in different months. Similar figures are given in Table IA, in respect of sheep and hill-bulls at Mukteswar, in which hourly body tempe- ratures are noted. Table IB is a supple- mentary table of body temperatures of buffaloes, cows and Hariana bullocks obtained from the records of another experiment. The figures have not been included in Table I because the times are different. Table IC is a frepuency distri- bution table of 744 temperature recordings of 38 buffaloes, these being intended as a check on the recordings of the smaller num- ber of animals shown in Table I. Table II shows for the various times and months the body temperature ranges in which most of the observations fell, the percentage of the observations falling within the range, and the air temperature range [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1. Mean daily body temp. for different times The data are also illustrated by charts. In Fig. 1 the mean daily body tem- peratures for different times during the month have been plotted, and in Fig. 1A the hourly mean temperatures of the sheep and hill-bulls are similarly displayed. From Fig. 1 it is seen that in buffaloes in December and April, the mean daily temperature is higher between 4 and 10 p.m. than at other times. In June, July and August the elevation is maintained to 1 or 4 o'clock in the morning. It is also seen

F. C. MINETT and S. SEN 77 graphs prepared for particular times the day are omitted to save space; however, the variations at particular lines can be seen from Fig. 1. It appears that the body temperature shows no marked variation from April to July, in August it declines a little and still more in December in the case of buffaloes. The mean daily body temperatures in April, June, July, August and December, calculated from all the observations of the month as used in Table I, were, for buffaloes: 100.81, 100.96, 100.96, 100.62, 99.74°F. for cows: 101.38, 101.41, 101.35, 100.99, 101.09°F. Thus between the winter and sum- mer readings (December, June) the dif- ference is 1.22°F. with buffaloes and 0.32°F. with cows. Fig. 2 is not drawn for sheep, goats and fowls since the observations were made in two months only and the monthly variation can be seen by glancing at Fig 1. From all the observations it appears that the mean daily body temperature of sheep in February, at Izatnagar, was 102.41°F. and in June 103.77°F., difference 1.36°F. With goats the corresponding figures are 102.70°F. and 104.79°F.,difference 2.09°F., figures higher than those given by Sadiq 1943], especially during the hot season] and with fowls 106.46°F. (in February) and 107.53°F. (in May), difference 1.07°F. Relation between air temperature and body temperature The information just given on the body temperature variations within the day and at different months agrees with the now well-known fact that air temperature largely influences body temperature in the animal species considered. In Fig. 3 are drawn graphs of the mid- range air temperature at different times of the day for different months and the mean daily body temperature at corres- ponding hours. Without going into details, it will be seen that except with the fowls a rising or falling body temper- ature follows, after a lag period of perhaps three hours, a rising or falling air temper- ature. With fowls, there was no indication from these experiments that a rising air temperature influenced the body temper- ature, but a falling air temperature after 4 p.m. was coincident with a falling body temperature. SUMMARY The following statement shows the mean daily body temperature of various species of animals in different months, together with the air temperature range. For fuller information, the reader is referred to data tabulated in the paper. Animals Month Air temperature (range, °F.) Mean daily body tempe- rature (°F.) April .. . . 100.81 June.. 8178 Rectal Temperatures of Animals at Re st 2. Hourly observations over 24 hours on hill-bulls and sheep showed that the body temperature starts to rise about 6 a.m., follows an upward trend till early evening and then gradually falls to a minimum value at about 1 to 4 a.m. 3. In cattle and buffaloes, sheep and goats the body temperature level is infl- uenced by the atmospheric temperature, variations in the latter being followed by similar variations of body temperature. The diurnal level therefore tends to be higher after 1 p.m. than before that time, the difference being far greater with buffaloes, sheep and goats than with cattle. 4. In temperature-taking, the personal factor is important. Without special instruction differences around 1.0°F. may be registered by different observers. The thermometer should be inserted as far as possible and left in position for one minute. 5. Following defaecation, the rectal temperature was lowered by 0.3°F. (mean) at 43 out of 51 trials.

HASHMI, Poultry Research Section, Imperial veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 9 September 1944.) EN [1942] was successful in eradi- ting Argas persicus larvae from affected awls by the application of a 10.0 per cent ueous suspension of derris root powder. The treatment was tried by the authors in an adult fowl, a one month old and six ago-week old heavily infested chicks in a private flock where 'seed-ticks' were cau- sing annoyance and loss. Six of the chicks ed within an hour of the derris appli- tion, while the two oldest birds suffered no apparent injury. In order to test the toxicity of derris applications, small-scale experiments were undertaken on chickens of different ages. EXPERIMENTAL The chicks used in these experiments were hatched and reared at the Institute poultry farm. In each experiment an equal number of untreated chicks were used as controls, all these remained healthy. Derris not powder was made into a 10.0 per cent suspension in water and after thorough stirring was applied with cotton-wool to the whole of body, except the natural ori- fices and eyes. The result is shown in Table I.

HART, Division of animal Husbandry, University of California, Davi (Reprinted from Nutrition Abstracts & Reviews, Vol. 10, No. 2, October 1940) INTRODUCTION VITAMIN A is essential for herbivorous animals but their food contains little or none. The riddle was not completely solved for nearly 20 years after MaCollum and Davis [1913] discovered the fat solu- ble vitamins, though it early became apparent that green plants also possessed vitamin A activity. Steenbock and his co-workers [1919; 1920; 1921] found a close correlation between the amount of yellow pigment in roots, maize, leaves and peas and their power to cure rats deprived of vitamin A. He offered the fruitful suggestion [1919] that vitamin A might be a leuco-form of a carotenoid pigment. Coward [1923], too, found that vitamin A activity was associated with the lipochro- mes in fruits and flowers and concluded that wherever carotene is found vitamin A may be expected to be present. The significance of the observations of Steenbock and his co-workers, and of Coward was obvious, but they did not bear fruit for some years. The early attempt of Drummond [1919, 2] to ascertain whether pure carotene could be subs- tituted for vitamin A miscarried, as caro- tene was unstable in the solvent, ethyl oleate, he happened to employ. Further, Steenbock, Sell and Buell [1921] could not discover any relationship between vitamin A potency and pigmentation in butter, cod liver oil or egg yolk. In 1928, however, Euler, Euler and Hell- strom [1928] proved that carotene cured rats suffering from advanced vitamin A deficiency and believed that it was as effec- tive as vitamin A. The matter was finally settled by Moore [1929] who showed that carotene was converted into vitamin A in the animal body and stored in the liver. The chemical relationship between vitamin A and carotene was believed by Karn and co-workers [1931] to be such that two molecules of vitamin A were formed from the division of the symmetrical molecules of ß-carotene with the addition of H2O this fission and hydrolysis presumab occurring in the body with the assistance of an enzyme. In cattle, according to Moore [1932] only part of the carotene absorbed changed into vitamin A, much being store in the body fat. The proportions store and converted vary with the breed of cattle and this accounts for differences in the depth of colour in their body fat and mil Preformed vitamin A has not bes found in plant tissues but active carote noids are present in all green plants, pur kins, sweet potatoes and carrots. Seed except yellow maize and palm kernel are relatively free and the amounts pr sent are inadequate for the nutrition animals. Active carotenoids other tha ß-carotene which occur in plants are GEORGE H. HART 81 carotene they contain, and expressed in ternational units of vitamin A. SYMPTOMS OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY CATTLE General The effect of vitamin A deprivation has been extensively studied in the bovine. Although a variety of manifestations may be present the diagnosis, particularly in ilder forms, may be difficult. Hart, Mead and Guilbert [1933] found that the time of manifestation varied in the same herd, because of differences in the previous food supply and amount of reserve stored by e animal. The state of maturity, lacta- tion, gestation, development, production and rate of growth all influenced the onset symptoms. Thus serious symptoms and fatalities may be present in young ock while adult animals show no symp- toms. Newborn calves from dairies on lfalfa ranches' when taken to be nursed depleted cows on a 'grain ranch' re- tained normal for 6 to 8 weeks. At the same time the calves of depleted cows on the same 'grain ranch' were weak and died 1 to 5 days. This would indicate that newborn calves from the former farms had reserve sufficient for a period of 6 to 8 weeks. Mead and Regan [1931], in their earlier work with calves on rations devoid of roughage, found that symptoms deve- loped in 1 to 3 months after the animals were changed from whole milk and grain to a concentrate mixture low in vitamin A. Halverson and Sherwood [1930] demon- strated that cottonseed poisoning of cattle as in fact caused by vitamin A deficiency. n one experiment a large percentage of teers on an exclusive ration of cottonseed eal and hulls developed symptoms in 88 days. In other experiments dairy heifers averaging less than 1 year of age were continued on the ration for 200 days before the advent of acute symptoms, Evidence is adduced by Flora et al. [1939] that animals on deficient rations contain- ing cottonseed developed symptoms in a shorter time than when the rations did not contain cottonseed. Guilbert and Hart [1934] studied the time required to deplete non-lactating cattle which had had ample opportunity to store vitamin A. Twelve steers 9 to 20 months of age were raised on native green pasture, irrigated alfalfa, or sudan grass, with alfalfa and sudan grass hay in the winter season. The first group of ani- mals, 4 in number, 12 to 19 months of age, was killed at the start. Their livers con- tained from 500 to 830 blue units per g. of liver tissue. The second group, 6 in num- ber, was placed on the experimental ration consisting of dried molasses beet pulp 70, rolled barley 14, cottonseed meal 15 and CaCO3 1 per cent. These animals were killed in pairs, 63, 121 and 282 days, res- pectively, after being placed on the ration; the last pair was in an advanced stage of vitamin A deficiency. The animals in this group showed a progressive loss of liver reserve. The first pair had 250 and 420 blue units (per g. of liver), respectively, the second, 160 and 50, and the last pair afforded only a trace of blue colour with the unsaponifiable matter from 20 g. of liver. Symptoms did not appear in the first 4 animals and were manifest after 225 days in the last pair. One after 252 days showed night blindness. The other animal had a slight nasal discharge on the 241st day and was also night blind on the 252nd day with some evidence of incoordi- nated movements. Facial paralysis deve- loped in both animals and in one of them the left ear drooped. The appetite and general appearance remained normal. On the 276th day a mild diarrhoea developed; nasal discharge and muscular incoordina- tion became rapidly more marked, the hair appeared rough, appetite failed, weight rapidly declined, but no lesions of the cornea developed. They were slaughtered on the 282nd day. No abnormality was found on post mortem examination and the carcases passed meat inspection. Both animals had a dressing percentage of about 65. The fat was snow white, whereas those killed at the expiration of 63 and 121 days showed a creamy yellow fat, and those
82 Vitamin A requirements of Form mamm als killed at the beginning of the experiment showed a still deeper colour. Carotene appears to be withdrawn from the adipose tissue during vitamin A deprivation with- out coincident reduction of the reserve of fat. The last pair showed a uniform daily increase of 1 and 1.3 lb. up to a few days before slaughter. This result is in har- mony with that of experiments on swine by Lund [1938] in which vitamin A defi- ciency did not affect digestion, protein and mineral metabolism or the utilisation of energy, but the appetite was gradually lowered. The third group, containing 2 animals, received, in addition to the concentrate mixture, 1 lb. daily of high quality field cured alfalfa hay. When slaughtered on the 127th day their livers had only 50 and 80 blue units, respectively, per g. of liver tissue, indicating that the limited intake of alfalfa had had little effect on the main- tenance of their reserves. In another experiment a heifer on a diet low in protein, phosphorus and vita- min A passed through a gestation and lactation but her milk flow was so meagre that her underdeveloped calf gained only 25 lb. in 5 months. Nevertheless the mother, after 14 months on the diet, showed no symptoms of vitamin A defi- ciency. Newborn calves were shown to have low reserves, indicating that the pregnant mother on high intake is unable to supply vitamin A to the foetus much faster than it is utilised. Dann [1932] showed this to be the case in rats and rabbits. Thus the foetus will suffer first when borderline deficiency is reached. In agreement with Drummond, Coward and Watson [1921] and others, colostrum was found to be relatively rich in vitamin A. Eye. Bechdel, Honeywell and Dutcher [1928] reported blindness in 1 of 5 animals on a ration deficient in vitamin A.Eye lesions were reported in calves by Halverson and Sherwood [1930] in their studies on cotton- seed poisoning. Meiga and Converse [1932] also reported the birth of blind calves in cows on low grade roughages. Mead and Regan [1931] demonstrated typical xerop thalmia in some of their calves raised of diets without roughage. Sanchez [1933] and also Schieblich [1934] described similar condition in Spain. Two hundred milk cows taken to Seville from Switzer- land gave birth to calves 80 per cent which were blind without visible ey lesions. Native cows also gave birth blind calves and the incidence decreased after green food was given. In the severe outbreak reported by Hart and Guilbert [1933] the eye lesions in the animals from a few weeks to one year of age varied from profuse lachry mation and slight clouding of the corn to extensive keratitis, ulceration of the cornea, loss of the aqueous humour, le opacity and shrinking of the eyeball wi complete and permanent blindness. Clou ing and ulceration of the cornea was also present in the steers from 1 to 2 years of age. Practically all of the adult cow showed night blindness without cornea lesions. Night blindness from vitamin A defi cieney is believed to result from an inad quate rate of regeneration of visual purple The nature of the defect has been elucid ted by Wald [1934], and has recently been discussed and the pertinent literáture reviewed by Tansley [1939]. Cows the are deficient only during the early month of pregnancy may give birth to permanent ly blind, but otherwise normal, calves. I young animals the amaurosis, once deve loped, is nearly always permanent, irrespec tive of the amount of vitamin A subsequent ly ingested. There has been some differen ce of opinion as to the cause of this form of blindness because it has occurred under conditions in which vitamin A deficienes was not suspected, and other possible causes have been suggested. The case reported by Crocker [1919] and considered to be the result of insidious rachitis were probably due to lack of vitamin A. D. Schweinitz [1931], and De Schweinitz and De Long[1934] described a similar condi tion under the name of papilloedema on choked disc and suggested that the defec
GEORGE H. HART 83 ight be hereditary. Moore, Huffman and Duncan [1935] described 24 cases of is condition in calves and growing dairy animals but concluded that it was different from blindness due to deficiency of vitamin A. Hart and Guilbert [1937] experiment- ly produced cases of blindness in vitamin deficiency. In these cases the pupils were widely dilated and there was a charac- teristic greenish colouration inside the eyeball when viewed through the cornea with the animal facing the light. There was pinching off and degeneration of the ptic nerves where they pass through the ptic canals in the sphenoid bone from tenosis of the walls of these canals. These authors regarded the bone changes s secondary, but, in view of the experi- ments of Mellanby [1938], this opinion ay need revision. Kuhlman, Gallup and Weaver [1936] reported both xerophthal- nia and the above permanent type of blindness in their calves on a diet low in vitamin A. Mellanby [1938] produced deafness in young puppies by withholding vitamin A. There was nerve degeneration of the ochlear neurons and new bony growth in the modiolus, with degenerative altera- tions in the organ of Corti and the sensory epithelium of the semicircular canals. He regarded the overgrowth of bone of the abyrinthine capsule through pressure and stretching, to be the most probable cause of the nerve degeneration. New macros- copic bone formation was also found at the base of the skull. This author con- cluded that nipping in the various foramina was the cause of the degeneration found in the optic, trigeminal and facial nerves. A report by Moore [1939], on blindness due to constriction of the optic nerve, papillary oedema and nyctalopia in calves deprived of carotene, has recently appeared. Papillary oedma was noted in 19 calves and 8 mature cows on low vitamin A rations, as well as in 3 calves at birth from dams receiving low intake of this factor. The night blindness was cured by the addition to the diet of carotene in the form of alfalfa hay. In none of these cases was xerophthalmia or keratitis observed. The blindness was attributed to intracranial pressure. It is presumed that permanent blindness occurs only in young animals because mature cows have the optic canal fully developed and calcified. Mucous membranes Vitamin A deficiency may affect epithelial structures in any part of the body as well as peripheral nerves and the central nervous system. Mason and Ellison [1935] suggest that vitamin A plays a part in protein metabolism within the epithelial cell. In deprivation the formation of glycoproteins or mucin seems to be retarded and that of albumenoids or keratin to be increased. The respiratory tract is commonly affec- ted and pneumonia is usually the terminal condition, causing death. This is frequent- ly a subacute pneumonia with nodules the size of a pea or larger scattered through the hepatised areas and containing a mix- ture of air and pus cells. Lung abscess is another condition developing late in the deficiency. The legs are sometimes swollen and oedematous and this may be due to presence of parenchymatous nephritis. HORSES Vitamin A deficiency in horses has been reviewed by Edwards [1937] and the literature from widely scattered parts of the world cited. Mitchell [1930; 1931; 1933; 1935; 1936] considers roaring, stringhalt, navicular disease and bony exostoses to be manifestations of nutri- tional deficiencies, including deficiency of vitamin A as well as Ca and P imbalance. In Finland Klemola [1933] showed that faulty hoops in the army horses were due to vitamin A deficiency. The scaly secre- tion of the peri-oplic band, which in places formed a thick spongy crust, changed to a normal, thin shiny, varnish like layer when vitamin A or carotene was supplied. The rations of horses as ordinarily made up in many parts of the world are
84 Vitamine A Requirements of Farm Mammals liable to be low in vitamin A. Particular- ly is this the case with army horses to which pasturage is not available. Meadows [1919] was undoubtedly describ- ing this condition as occurring in horses and camels in Persia during the Great War and rendering them useless and dangerous for night operations. Guilbert, Howell and Hart [1940] have determined minimum vitamin A and carotene requirements of some mammals, including the horse. Night blindness developed on the rations commonly used. The necessity for two standards for expressing requirements, one for vitamin A and one for carotene, was pointed out. PIGS In their early experiments Hart and McCollum [1914] showed that when wheat kernel was the only food supplied, pigs developed dragging of the hind quarters and general paralysis, with a peculiar deflection of the head. This did not occur when milk or egg yolk was added to the diet. Histopathological studies of the tissues of affected swine were reported two years later by Hart, Miller and McCollum [1916]. Marked alterations were found in the motor cells of the spinal cord. At the time, these were credited to the inherent toxicity of the wheat kernel but the possibility was raised of the limited vitamin A in the diet being res- ponsible. The paralysis was later shown by Hughes, Lienhardt and Aubel [1929] to be caused by nerve degenerations in portions of the spinal cord, optic, sciatic and femoral nerves of affected swine. Hale [1933] reported that a gilt whose diet was deficient in vitamin A farrowed 11 pigs without eyeballs. Elder [1935] described cases in which incoordination occurred under natural conditions with a stringhalt like gait and posterior para- lysis. This incoordination in some cases caused lateral spinal curvature with a swaying gait and gave the impression that the hind quarters could not track the fore quarters but followed off to one side. Swine paralysis due to vitamin A deficien- cy was also reported by Dunlop [193 on rations which had been recommended for general use in England. In feeding experiments with 0.5 to per cent commercial cod liver oil given conjunction with a meal mixture common ly used in pig feeding practice, Foot et [1939] found that pigs made good p gress while controls on the meal mixture alone failed to thrive. The symptom shown by pigs receiving no cod liver included loss of appetite, cessation growth, impairment of vision in daylight abnormal gait, convulsive fits and nervo collapse. Pneumonia or inflammation the intestines or both occurred in all of pigs that died during fattening. SHEEP Sheep on a diet deficient in vitamin suffer from night blindness and in some cases have permanent defective vision semidarkness, irrespective of subsequent vitamin A intake or storage. Such ani mals cannot be used for the study of the minimum requirements of vitamin A means of the night blindness test. Aged ewes, without the drain of repro duction or lactation, are able to remain a long time on rations deficient in vitamin. A without showing symptoms. In 4 su animals at this station, 22 months elapsed before night blindness was manifeste They were killed in cachexia after 27 to months. As in cattle, vitamin A was with drawn from stores more rapidly during the first year than subsequently. Onset symptoms following the development night blindness was gradual. They we anorexia, loss of condition and muscul weakness. In the final stages 2 of the ani mals had partially clouded corneas b sight in daylight was never seriously in paired. Pneumonia, enteritis and pare chymatous lesions in the kidney were the outstanding post mortem findings. Efforts have been made to trace t etiology of urinary calculi to vitamin deficiency but so far without definite pro Calculi are more common in sheep than other farm species.
GEORGE H. HART 85 EFFECT ON REPRODUCTION After it became established that vita- min A was essential for normal reproduc- tion in mammals, the study of the effects of s deficiency on reproduction in the bovine becies was complicated by the widespread kistence of infectious abortion. The early work of Hart, McCollum, teenbock and Humphrey [1911] on the effect on reproduction of rations restricted to a single plant, wheat, oats or maize, oved conclusively that failure of repro- nction could be of nutritional origin. Their first experiments led them to suggest that toxic bodies carried in the rations or produced in the intestinal tract, and also oor mineral content of the diet, might afford a possible explanation. Further work, published in 1917 after the disco- very of vitamin A, did not suggest that the absence of this vitamin was the cause. In 1920 additional work with the oat plant was published and again reproductive failure occurred; this was attributed to low a. Hart, Steenbock, Humphrey and Hulce [1924] presented new observations and fresh interpretations of the previous work from which they concluded that the wheat plant was deficient in both vitamin A and Ca. The addition of these subs- tances made the wheat plant ration comp- lete for reproduction, thus making it unnecessary to continue to assume the presence of a toxic factor. Hadley and Hawn [1929] and Hart, adley and Humphrey [1932] demonstrated that a good ration did not increase resis- tance to infectious abortion nor did a poor ne increase susceptibility. In their ex- perience lack of vitamin A was an impor- tant cause of failure of reproduction. Incidentally they confirmed the observa- tions of Golding, Soames and Zilva [1926] that cod liver oil given to cows on a high plane of nutrition was responsible for reducing the butterfat by more than 20 per cent. Meigs and Converse [1932] reported affects on reproduction in dairy cows of rations containing low grade roughage. After fairly long periods on grain and U.S. No. 3 timothy hay the animals gave birth to premature dead or weak and blind calves. When a better grade of timothy hay was given the proportion of normal claves was larger and, when the roughage consisted of U.S. No. 1 alfalfa hay repro- duction was quite satisfactory. Hart and Guilbert [1933] studied vitamin A deficiency in a severe natural outbreak in a herd of 250 head of which 100 died. Reproductive failure was complete in 25 to 30 cows calving at the height of the deficiency; all the calves were born weak, had severe diarrhoea and died in 1 to 5 days. Less severe manifestations were reported by Hart, Guilbert and Goss[1932] under natural range conditions during prolonged dry seasons. When expulsion of weak or dead offspr- ing occurs, a differential diagnosis can be made between this condition and that of infectious abortion, if conditions permit agglutination tests with Brucella abortus antigen to be made. The Carr and Price colorimetric test can be applied to liver samples of the foetuses and, if no colour is obtained, vitamin A deficiency is to be considered. Both conditions may be involved, as indicated by the experiments reported by Haring and Traum[1937]. Infectious abortion attacks the cells of the maternal and foctal placenta. The same cells are affected in vitamin A deficiency. Mason [1935] has shown that in vitamin A deficiency foetal death is secondary to marked placental injury, whereas vitamin E deficiency affects the foetal tissue primarily. Diarrhoea in the newborn due to vita- min A deficiency may be confused with white scours. The history of the cases and analysis of liver tissue will help in diagnosis. If due to the former it will be promptly cured with vitamin A therapy. Severe losses from white scours occur when intake of vitamin A is ample and its use as a therapeutic agent under these conditions is unavailing. A recent report on this subject has been made by Stewart
86 Vitamine-A Requirment of Farm Mammals and McCallum[1938]. Moore and Hallman [1936] have suggested from their experi- mental evidence that white spotted kidney in calves may be the result of vitamin A deficiency. Ability of bulls and of cows to breed is not necessarily lost even when they are completely night blind and have muscular incoordination. Some evidence of struc- tural changes in the seminiferous tubules of bulls has been reported by Guilbert and Hart[1935]. No sperm were found in the testes of one of their experimental animals that died of the deficiency. A young bull became so depleted as to develop permanent blindness from optic nerve constriction. Later, when supplied with adequate vitamin A, this animal became an active breeder, its semen contained mobile sperm, and it sired normal offspr- ing, indicating that cessation of sperma- togenesis, which may occur at the height of the deficiency, is not permanent. In another experiment of Hart and Miller [1937] 11 of 17 ewes which at breed- ing time were night blind conceived and 2 had twin foetuses. The depletion was continued in these 11 cases and all of the lambs were born dead or died within 24 hours. Thus it may be stated in general that ability to conceive is affected late in the deficiency but failure of gestation is a relatively early manifestation. In hogs there is some evidence of apparently re- duced prominence of the testicles in defici- ent boars as compared with controls of the same age. Gestation also fails in this species and, according to Hughes [1934] and Hughes, Aubel and Lienhardt [1928], resorption of the foetuses is common. Although carotene is the pigment caus- ing the yellow colour in the corpus luteum this has probably no function in repro- duction. In the heifers studied by Mead and Regan [1931], which had no roughage but were supplied with cod liver oil, the corpus luteum was found to be completely lacking in pigment. Other animals in the same group were going through normal reproduction. STORAGE AND DEPLETION While storage of vitamin A under average condititions is ample for reason able periods of low intake there are many conditions in which knowledge of the min mum requirements is of practical impor tance. The reserves of vitamin A in the n born are low. With a given intake the r of storage depends on the degree of dep tion and rate of growth, so that maximum storage occurs in adults of advanced a The reserves in tissus other than liv fat and blood serum may be considered negligible. Semb, Banmann and Steenbo [1934] found that the blood serum of cattle contained significant reserves. Guilbert and Hart [1935] found that in cattle w livers having 300 to 500 blue units per the lung and spleen extracts gave negative tests and the kidneys contained only 1 5 units per g. The reserves in the bo fat of these animals varied from 7 to per cent of the total. In normally animals the reserves in the liver we largely composed of vitamin A, whereas the fat carotene predominated. The da of Guilbert and Hart [1935] showed withdrawal from storage of 4 to 5 m daily or obout 9 to 11 GEORGE H. HART 87 is constituted an average daily storage 30 mg. in excess of requirements. There was a concentration of 500 blue fits per g. of liver tissue which is com- prable to the amount present in the liver 1 to 2-year old cattle kept under optimum conditions. These results com- pare favourably with those obtained in the t by Davies and Moore [1934]. In one Guilbert and Hart's experiments it had been shown that animals receiving 1 lb. ily of a fairly green chopped alfalfa hay addition to a basal ration low in vita- min A did not show clinical symptoms of deficiency after a period 7 months longer an was required to deplete similar ani- mals on the basal ration alone, but as two of these animals secreted milk so ficient in vitamin A that their nursing lves developed night blindness their take must have been below the mini- mum. MINIMUM REQUIRMENTS OF VITAMIN A A study was also made by Guilbert and Hart of minimum requirements for cattle with the cure of night blindness as a st for sufficiency. Experiments were rted when the animals exhibited com- plete night blindness in semi-darkness, and frequently other nervous symptoms addition. Small amounts of chopped alfalfa hay or dehydrated alfalfa meal of own carotene content were supplied and e quantity increased at intervals until normal weight increases occurred and clinical symptoms were cured. After 3 years' work, data were accumulated making evident that the minimum daily require- ment of carotene as supplied by alfalfa by between 26 and 33 88 Vitamin A Requirement of Farm Mammals Summary of data on minimum vitamin A and carotene requirements of various species Species Daily intake per kg. bodyweight Vitamin A Carotene GEORGE H.

The cause of the condition was not determined. Carotene has been supposed to have some relation to one of the commonly occur- ring off-flavour termed 'oxidized'. It was found by Guthrie, Roadhouse and Richard- son [1931] to result from contact of the milk with Cu or Cu alloys. Kende[1932] studied the relation of the diet given to cows to its development. It occurred in winter, and green feed or fresh hay was shown to contain considerable amounts of reducing substances which tend to pre- vent oxidized flavour or lessen its intensity. Anderson [1936] and Anderson, Wilson and Hardenbergh [1937] have concluded that the substance responsible for the beneficial effect of green food, artificially dehydrated alfalfa and carrots in preven- ting 'oxidized' flavour was carotene. Whitnah, Martin and Beck [1937] showed that spontaneously occurring oxidized flavour could be prevented on high caro- tene rations. Beck, Whitnah and Martin [1939] found no relation between frequen- cy of occurrence of oxidized flavour and the lecithin or vitamin A content of the milk but it was effectively prevented by giving as little as 206 mg. carotene per head daily to cows that had been constant- ly producing milk with this off-flavonr. Brown, Vanlandingham and Weakley [1939] found that ascorbic acid given at the rate of 1 g daily partly, and carotene given at the rate of 350 mg. daily greatly reduced the production of 'oxidized flavour' by contact with metals. They were of the opinion, however, that the spontaneous development of oxidized flavour was not due to the ration being low in carotene. The literature contains many references on the vitamin A and disease but that subject is too large to be covered in this review although some references to it have been made. Epithelial cells are widely distributed in the body. It is logical to consider that the keratinisation of these cells would lower their resistance to invasion by bacteria and parasites. Many of lesions produced in vitamin A deficiency result from secondary bacterial invasi and, in advanced cases of such deficien these lesions overshadow the primary defi ciency and are the apparent cause of death The claims of enthusiasts for the pr phylactic action of vitamin A against infec tions have not been substantiated by ex perimental and clinical data. Neverth less it is a safe maxim that to support adequately the requirements of vitamin in the rations of our animal populations a part of good husbandry. It takesi place with many other factors in mai tenance of better health, well being an production. REFERNCES Anderson, J. A., (1936). Proc. 29th Annu. Congr. Inter Assoc.

Res. 2, 131-35 IN view of the importance to the veterinary profession of new discoveries and constantly developing knowledge in nutrition, a brief review of development has been traced from the close of the last century. Nutritional requirements vary with different species of farm animals. Contributions of recent researches reveal some very interesting facts. The various factors in the water soluble vitamin B- complex, including thiamin, riboflavin, panthothenic acid, nicotinic acid and pyridoxine, have been proved to be synthesized by bacterial action in the rumen of cattle and sheep. It is therefore not an essential factor in the dietary constituents of these animals. This synthesis is also a probability in horses' caecum, but it is as yet unsupported by experimental data. Pigs require this B-complex in diet, as no such syntheses take place in their bodies. As the hatchability of eggs and viability of chicks are dependent on B-complex in diet, this also constitutes an essential factor in poultry breeding. Subcutaneous administration of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has recently been shown to be of value in temporary sterility in bulls. Vitamin A is essential in all farm animals. The possibility of vitamin-Edeficieney is very doubtful, as vitamin E is widely distributed in foodstuffs or synthesized in the system of the domestic animals. Animals living largely on roughages, as cattle and sheep, require bonemeal as a source of phosphorus in their diet. As bonemeal contains a high percentage of calcium, no extra calcium is needed when bonemeal is given. Hogs and poultry which get limited roughage require calcium in the form of ground limestone or oyster shell flour in their diet. Consideration in all cases has to be made of the cheapest source available of minerals supplied to livestock beyond what is contained in their regular feeds. Milk fever has been shown to be due to the temporary inability of the animal to transport calcium into the blood from the body store at the same rate as it is taken out in the milk of the heavy producers. Parathyroid as a pivot of calcium metabolism may be involved. Further research is however, necessary to sufficiently enlighten the point. Iodine gains its importance due to its deficiency appearing in widespread and localised areas. Iron deficiency is demonstrated in anaemia in young nurs pigs kept on wood or cement floors and is overcome painting the udders of the nursing sow with iron prep tions. In cattle combined deficiency of copper and in which Hb content of BBC was greatly reduced, has h reported from Florida. Heredity and environment are both important fact in the development of livestock. If the environment level can be raised by improving the feed supply, then limits of selective breeding can be proportionately ext ded. Without phosphorus supplement, attempts improve the native cattle was a complete failure in tern parts of the Union of South Africa. Environment animals is largely a matter of management, mainly con ting of nutrition. Livestok production has definit been benefited by nutritional rosearches, enabling most economical use of the local cheap foods by success fully supplementing their deficiencies. Prarie hay w calcium carbonate and grain mixture, for example was nearly equal to alfalfa hay and grain mixture much less cost. It is, at present, possible to obtain a cheap a abundant supply of synthetic urea. It contains a h percentage of nitrogen and can successfully replact part of the protein requirements in the diet of rumin ts. The nitrogen is converted by bacterial action protein. This discovery promises a successful appli tion wherever protein feeds are costly as in the Haw ian islands. [A. K. P.] The pH of vaginal mucus of normal and sten dairy cows. S F. SMITH and S.A.

P.] determination and clinical correlation of iations in the calcium, inorganic phosphorus, serum proteins of horse blood. A. HENRY AIGE, Jr. and JOHN. D. GADD. (1941). Amer. vet. Res. 2, 227-256 ER a general review of literature on the calcium, organic phosphorus and protein contents of normal horse d as also the changes they undergo under variovs osteo- rophic disease conditions, the authors proceed to give r own findings and interpret the clinical variations respect to various factors, such as age, sex, breed, on, pregnancy and diseased conditions, etc. They d hat the period allowed to elapse between the time collection of blood and its chemical examination, had effect on the inorganic phosphorus, calcium, and ein values. If, however, the serum is separated soon r the blood gets clotted, there is little change observed ese values. Sex difference has got no influence on ical composition of blood. Mares in foal and those ntly delivered showed distinct variations from the non- nant mares, specially in the serum protein values. In nant mares, the total protein was high and the albu- : lobulin (A:G) ratio was considerably low, averag- 0.8 as compared with 1.3, the average for males and pregnant females. With respect to calcium, there a definite tendency towards hypocalcemia during the stage of pregnancy when the fetus was making strong ands on the dam for calcium to promote ossification. ganic phosphorus showed little alterations. Age definitely lowers the inorganic phosphorus of blood. foalsless than three months old, the average is 7.1 mg/ c.c. This average receded with advancing age to a imum of 3.1 mg/100 c.c. for horses over five years old. he case of pregnant mares, the value is still less for the half of the year which exceeds the minimum (3.1) in during the second half. Age does not appear to any influence on the serum calcium values, average g 12.2 mg/100 c.c. In the case of total serum pro- , foals less than three months old showed a signifi- ily low average (5.1), while for animals above this the average was 6.1 gm./100 c. c. The A:G ratio ie highest in the youngest group (below three ths:1.7) reaching a constant average value (1.3) for nals above six months through an intermediate value for animals between three and six months). Seasons, too, have their effects. The total serum ein showed a distinct gradual rise and fall from one on to another. In June and February the highest Is were obtained. A similar trend was observed he level of total calcium. From a high level in July, average calcium value sinks in August to rise gra- ly to another high point in November, while the eins remain relatively constant until October. The 'age inorganic phosphorus in five year old horses, males and pregnant and non-pregnant females, aled a constant rise from a minimum of 2.8 mg/100 in March to a peak of 3.9 in July. Thence it gra- lly receded to 3.3 by September. A further reduction encountered only in winter. Feeding had also slight t, especially on the calcium values. Based on an idea that the variations in calcium and phorus values are to a significant extent the result nteractions among calcium, phosphorus and protein, authors have suggested an equation, viz. Ca++ + 0.4 P94 ABSTRACTS collect the semen samples from the bulls; in each case 1-2 c.c. of semen was used to inseminate the cows and laboratory examinatien was made with the remaining portion of the semen to evaluate its quality. The labora- tory examination of semen included (i) total amount of ejaculate (ii) microscopic estimation of motility (iii) spermatozoa counts (iv) tabulation of the number and different kinds of abnormal spermatozoa (v) pH determi- nation. Semen samples were evaluated as excellent, good, fair or poor, and the sperm counts were made with haema- cytometers with normal saline as the diluting fluid. In making semen smears, ordinary blood smear method was used, which were, stained with eosinhaematoxylin method after being fixed in Schaudinns solution. Hydrogen-ion determinations were made with a potentiometer with glass and colomel electrodes. The authors could not find any correlation between the quality of the semen samples as evaluated by the laboratory methods employed by them and the actual breeding performances. In one bull, however, a slight negative correlation was noted between the number of abnormal forms of spermatozoa and the fertilizing ability. The results obtained by the authors demonstrate a consi- derable diurnal and daily variations in the characteris- ties of the semem, differences being more pronounced in samples obtained from bulls in excessive sexual use. A correlation was noted between the motility and viability of spermatozoa and changes in the pH values of semen in the first few hours after the sample has been taken. Sperm motility has been found to be a factor in causing the hydrogen-ion changes of semen. Very motile samples showed a gradual rapid decline in pH. Semen samples of two bulls known to be of poor fertility were usually alkaline and on standing, the pH values increased. When the spermatozoa were inactivated by refrigeration or treatment with 0.2 c. c. of a 1:1,000 solution of bichlo- ride of mercury, the rapid decline in pH was prevented. Hydrogen-ion determinations were also made on seminal vesicle secretions and ampuli contents of 17 abattoir spocimens; pH of the former varied from 5. 59 to 6. 48 and that of the latter from 5. 66 to 6. 33. It has been suggested that pH deteminations of semen samples should be made immediately after collection. A few preliminary experiments have also been made to find out whether or not there is any correlation bet- ween the ascorbic acid content of semen and breeding performances of the bull. Seventeen semen samples obtai- ned from five bulls were analysed and the ascorbic acid content of semen varied from 0. 97 mg. to 8.08 mg. per 100 c. c. of semen. Although the ascorbic acid content of semen from one bull with poor breeding performance was rather high, the results obtained indicated a positive correlation between ascorbic acid content of the semen samples and the breeding efficiency of the bulls. The authors remark that no single test can be used to judge the fertilizing quality of semen and that even when all the common tests are made the evaluations are of doubtful value except in extreme cases. [P. B.] A method of determining the reproductive effi- ciency of cattle. H.E. KINGMAN and H. E. KINGMAN, (1942). J. Amer. Vet. Res. 3 IN this article the authors have shown how to keep and arrange records relating to reproduction in cattle so that the breeding histories of individuals or groups can be studied separately or collectively. They have discussed the importance of statistical analysis of data for deter- mining the reproductive efficiency of the herd. Various methods of calculation of reproductive efficiency been discussed and their merits shown. The following been found to be the most suitable one. Cq (Calf equivalent)/Cr (Cow years) ×100=R (%Reproductive ciency), when Cq=M (Months of Normal Pregnancy)/ 9 (Gestation period in cattle in months) and Cr = ber of cows in each year ; the basis of calculation cow year is 12 months, but when a cow is in the herd 9 months or more, she is included in the 12 month gr The general formula for estimating the breeding effici ency of the bull consists of dividing the number of succes ful services by the total number of services and mult ying by hundred, the result is expressed in percent. methods of calculation for comparing the reproduc efficiency of a bull by various system of breeding when comparing the reproductive efficiency of diffe bulls by the same method of breeding have also 1 given. The forms used at the Wyoming Hereford Ra Trust for keeping the daily reports, records of indivi cow compiled from the daily reports and veterinary reports have been reproduced and their advantages di ssed. The methods of analysis have been illustrated charts, tables and graphs. [P. B.] The bacterial content of goat milk. C S. BRY (1942). Amer. J. vet. Res. 3. 92-95 THIS study was undertaken to determine the incide of infectious and non-infectious mastitis in dairy g and the effect of udder infection on the quality quantity of the milk produced. The tests employed (1) standard plate count, (2) methylene blue reduct test and (3) resazurin reduction test. The chemical cellular quality was noted by finding the percentage chloride, the pH and leucocyte content of the milk. In all the milk samples from 380 goats in 15 herds per cent had streptococcal mastitis, 1.3 per cent staphylococcal mastitis and 0.5 per cent had non-in tious mastitis; and 95.9 per cent had neither infect nor non-infectious mastitis. The distribution of same among the various classes of the tests employed b close relationship to the results obtained upon tes similar samples from cows; but the chloride determ tion, pH test and leucocyte count of milk cannot be to determine the udder infection, although they acc tely determine the chemical and cellular content of milk. The bacteriologic quality of the milk produced goats, with and without udder infection, was determine by the methylene blue and resazurin reduction tests the standard plate count; the results varied from sample to the other. Ninety-seven and one-half per cent of the non-infec animals gave milk of class I methylene blue test qual 94.0 per cent of class I resazurin test quality, and per cent had a bacteria count of over 1,000. Consider the goats with staphylococcal mastitis, 56.0 per gave milk of class I methylene test quality, 40.0 per class I resazurin test quality, and 12. 0 per cent h bacteria count of more than 1,000. The quality of produced by the goats affected with streptococcal tis was greatly reduced; only 40. 0 per cent gave mill class I methylene blue test quality, 37. 0 per cent I resazurin test quality, and 50. 0 per cent yielded with a bacteria count of more than 1,000.

ABSTRACTS 95 eriarnce as a factor in poultry disease research. C.A. BRANDLY and N. F. WATEAS (1942). Amer. J. vet. Res 105-110 FEN'S work on resistance to mycotic stem rust in eat demonstrated the importance of inheritance in ation to diseases and laid the foundation of the present knowledge of disease heredity. Progress with mals due to practical difficulties has, however, been ch slower than in plants. Numerous examples are en of the inheritance of non-infectious pathological ditions in animals and birds. Reference is also made the work of various workers upon differences in ceptibility among families within species or varieties. the role of hereditary resistance and susceptibility of various classes of animals to various neoplasms and cemia has been definitely established by numerous rkers. The possibility that a pathogenic organism virus may change or mutate must also be borne in id. Stress is laid on the necessity of working on host terial of known resistance or susceptibility. However, vironment is also very important for the level of istance which is inherited can be altered by feeding management. Though the fundamental principles of genetics are atively simple, it is unfortunate that most of the nomic characters in both plants and animals are dependant on the interaction between many genes and t on two genes as in some of the lower forms of life. breeding automatically brings about homozygosity that the same time it increases the diversity from nily to family even though these families start m common stock; Inbreeding increases homozygosity both good and bad characters but it does not create fects and it merely uncovers them by purification of characters already present. Inbred strains of all animals have proved of great value in research t little systematic inbreeding has been done in large imals. Little information is yet available about the mech- ism of inherited immunity. In pullorum disease it s been shown that the lymphocytes are present in eater numbers and percentages in resistant chicks from e 18th day of incubation to the 3rd day after hatching. Further resistance increases rapidly with age due to crease in the lymphocytes. Age resistance in chickens Ascaridia lineata is due to an increase in goblet cells the duodenal mucosa and the mucus secreted by these lls inhibits the development of the parasite. Chickens and other species of poultry are very itable for genetical studies in relation to diseases, r they can be kept fairly cheaply and large numbers n be bred rapidly. By exposure of unselected stock standard infection, it is sometimes possible, even one generation, to classify into resistant and seeptible groups. In using the term resistance or immunity and seeptibility, it is important to remember that all of e individuals of any particular strain may not behave ike; some of the so-called resistant strain may contract e disease whilst others of the susceptible strain may t succumb. Statistical examination of all the data ,therefore, essential. Frequent testing of the host aterial is also essential if the degree of immunity is to be aintained or increased. [A. J. M.] What research has accomplished in modern poul- try production. E. JUNGHERR (1941). Amer. J. vet. Res. 2,259-61 THE author discusses the influence of research in building up the poultry industry and singles out four branches of poultry science, namely management, gene- tics, nutrition and pathology. The author does not give a critical review but merely cites various examples which have had much influence on the development of the industry. Mass. production of poultry has been rendered possi- ble only through the introduction of artificial incubation, and amention is made of the pioneer work done by W. P. Hall and S. B. Smith. Research on house construction, ventilation and range management has also contributed to the growth of commercial poultry farming. The remarkable achievement of a hen which laid 1,464 eggs in eight years at the Vineland contest is quoted as an example of what has been done through intelligent breeding based on critical research. The work of Raymond Pearl, who carried out the first systematic analysis on fecundity, along with the resear- ches of Goodale and Hays on the factors governing egg production, is mentioned. Acknowledgments are made to work on progeny testing by Gowell and on sex linkage by Dunn, but no mention is made of the fundamental researches on sex-linkage by Punett and Pease. In the field of nutrition, the work on poultry takes only second place to that on rats. Mention is made of the pioneer work by Eijkman who used poultry to investigate the anti-beri beri vitamin. Other contributions mentioned are the discovery of vitamin D by Mc Collum and Simmonds, the value of cod liver oil in preventing rickets in chickens by Hart Haplin and Steenbock and the value of manganese in preventing perosis by Wilgus, Norris and Heuser. In the realms of pathology, mention is made of the discovery of bacillary white diarrhoea by Rittger and the method of vaccination against laryngotracheitis introduced by Beauditte and Hudson. The value of poultry meat and eggs in human nutrition is also touched upon. The discovery of vitamin K, the blood coagulating factor, in chicks and its present use in combating haemorrhage in man has proved of great value. The work of Rous and Goodpasture on chick embryos has proved of immense value in the production of human and animal vaccines. Despite the advances that have been made, adult mortality has steadily increased during the last twenty years, both in America and Britain. Work on a large scale on the dreaded fowl paralysis or leucosis complex is now being carried out at the U. S. Regional Poultry Research Laboratories, East Linsing, Mich. The author calls for closer cooperation among all branches of research workers in order to meet the many problems still confronting the industry. [A. J. M.] Co-ordinated trials with phenothiazine against nematodes in lambs. (Imperial Agricultural Bureaux Joint Publication 4,1943) Conflicting reports on phenothiazine as an anthelmi- ntic and the use of different criteria in the assessment of its efficacy led the Agricultural Research Council of the United Kingdom to plan and institute a series of co-ordinated trials at several centres in Great Britain to accumulate results that would admit of adequate statistical analysis, and would also furnish answers to certain specific questions. The present report is the outcome of findings at different centres.
96 ABSTRACTS The drug, having specific composition and character, was tested in single doses at varying dose levels against sheep nematodes, using egg counts, worm counts and lamb weights as criteria of efficacy. Lambs, with a level of infestation of about 1,000 eggs per gramme of faeces were selected to represent the type that required treatment most. At each centre a unit flock of 28 lambs was used and given the following doses of phenothiazine in batches of four ; 0 (controls) 5 gm., 10 gm., 20 gm., 30 gm., 40 gm. and 50 gm. In each batch two received the drug as compressed tablets and the other two as powder made into a drench with water. As a wetting and dispersing agent about 2 per cent sodium cetyl sulphate was used in both cases. In the control group, two received nothing, while the remaining two received sodium cetyl sulphate as a drench as was present in the 50 gm. dose, and they served as controls respectively against the lambs receiving the drug as tablets and as drench. Four unit flocks, kept inside for six weeks to avoid re-infestation, supplied information on egg and worm counts, and six others, maintained outside for sixteen weeks under natural conditions, provided data on the net effects of treatment on the growth of lambs. Each lamb was allotted to its flock (inside or outside), to its dosage level and to tablets or drench quite at random. Uniformity in respect of recording results was maintained at all centres. Statistical analysis of the findings under different headings and other evidence revealed the following facts. The main fall in the total egg count was obtained with the first 5 gm. of phenothiazine administered; beyond that level the diminution was comparatively small and irregular. The marked susceptibility of Haemonchus to a 5 gm. dose was mainly responsible for the diminution in egg counts, while larger dose3 were required for most of the intestinal worms to effect significant reduction. Strongyloides, Trichuris, Nematodirus and Moniezia gave anomalous responses, the last two actually showed increased counts with higher doses. Weight gains of lambs indicated progressive advantage with increasing dosage; the suggestion was that higher doses were responsible for the reduction not only of stomach worms, but also of certain intestinal worms, viz. Bunostomum, Trichostrongylus spp. and Cooperia considered to be of little importance in respect of lamb's health. It also appeared that weight responses were independent of the initial degree of infestation. The belief that heavily infested animals do not respond so well as lightly infested ones was not therefore substantiated. Tablets and drenches containing the same amount of phenothiazine did not differ in efficacy. It may be that drench is slightly more efficacious against stomach worms and, if so, it is possible that phenothiazine particles in a tablet require mixing with hosts bile salts before they are fully dispersed. Full details are given of the statistical calculations and of the egg and worm counting techniques used.[S.S.] Urea as a partial protein substitute in the feeding of dairy Cattle. E. C OWEN, J. A. B. SMITH. and N. C. WRIGHT (1943). Biochem. J. 37, 44 UREA was fed to a group of seven lactating cows to determine its value as a partial substitute for blood meal. It provided up to 33 per cent of the nitrogen in the pro- duction ration or 25 per cent of the total nitrogen intake. For two cows urea was fed for a period of six weeks and then replaced by blood meal. For the other five cows, a period of about a fortnight, without either urea or blood meal, was inserted as a negative control period. Resa for milk yield, milk composition, body weight chang nitrogen balance, urea utilisation and the excretion creatine and creatinine are given. Though urea is diuretic agent, its feeding was reported to produce excessive or harmful diuresis. Throughout the expe ment, there was no marked change in the body weight the animals. No definite conclusion is reported conce ing the study of creatine and creatinine excretion. T nitrogen balance data show that the retention of u was not complete. About 25 per cent of the ingested u was wasted. Since a considerable individual variat was shown, the proportion of dietary urea, which w wasted, seems to depend upon the nutritional state of animals prior to urea feeding. The urea content of blood appears to rise at the start of the urea feeding a then adjusts itself to the normal value. The cone tration of the non-protein nitrogen in the blood and t in the milk run parallel, as did that of the urea conte of the milk and the blood which never exceeded 28 per 100 ml., a concentration which is considered harml In general the milk yields of the animals were well ma tained when blood meal was replaced by urea and it p duced no alteration on the percentage of protein, to solids, fat and lactose in the milk.

Samples containing corn syrup developed colour during storage (11 weeks) than did all suc samples. The brown discolouration increased dur storage, as the pre-heating temperature of the milk as w as the storage temperature was raised from 170 to 200 and 40 to 90°F. respectively. As for the development discolouration, whole and skim milk behaved similar There was less physical thickening and less brown d colouration when the samples were stored at a lower to perature. Corn syrup lowered the pH of the conden milks. Flavour changes during storage were least at 40 and greatest at 90°F.

Harwood et al (1938) for the first time reported its efficacy against Ascaris and Oesophagostomum of pigs. Subsequently, numerous reports have been published on its use as an anthelmintic. In view of certain discrepan- cies in these reports and the fact that different workers used different criteria in assessing its efficacy, the Agri- cultural Research Council, U. K., initiated a series of planned trials, carried out by the same technique at several centres in Great Britain. These trials, involving some 280 lambs, were so planned as to yield results susceptible of adequate statistical analysis and afford data on the effect of phenothiazine, in single doses, against sheep nematodes, using lamb weights, egg and worm counts as criteria of efficacy. The drug used fulfilled the specification suggested by Imperial Chemical Industries as desirable for phenothia- zine for veterinary use. Only lambs with a level of infestation of about 1,000 eggs per gm. of faeces were selected. Each unit flock, besides reserves, consisted of 28 lambs and was given the following doses (in grams) of phenothiazine in batches of four: 0 (controls), 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50. In each batch, except the controls, two lambs received the drug as compressed tablets and two as powder made into a drench with water. Two per cent sodium cetyl sulphate was used as a wetting and dispersing agent in both cases. Four of such unit flocks were maintained for six weeks inside, i.e. under conditions precluding reinfestation, and six unit flocks were kept for sixteen weeks outside, under natural conditions. The observations recorded provide information on ( the effect of the drug on particular species of worms revealed by egg and worm counts of the inside flock, a (II) resulting net effect of the drug upon the lam themselves, as shown by periodical weighings of lambs the outside flock. The following points of interest emer from these trials. The greatest relative reduction in egg count w achieved by the lowest dose (5 gm.) used; higher dos reduced the counts further to a relatively small extent irregularly. From the worm counts, the stomach worms Haemonch appeared to be markedly susceptible to lower levels gm.) of phenothiazine. With the intestinal worm Bunostomum, Trichostrongyius and Cooperia-the respon was less marked but continued up to the highest do used. Anomalous responses were obtained with Strong loides, Trichurus, Nematodirrus and Moniezia . In the outside flocks kept under natural condition though the reductions in egg count were obliterated reinfestation, there was a relatively large weight respon which increased roughly in proportion to dosage up to highest dose used. This must be due, judging from 'inside' worm counts, to the reduction not merely stomach worms but also of certain intestinal won usually considered of little clinical importance. No difference in efficacy was observed between tali and drenches containing the same weight of phenothiazi The report contains a concise historical review previous work on the anthelmintic efficacy of phenothiaz The methods and techniques used are fully described are satisfactory.

ORIGINAL ARTICLES LTIPLICATION OF B. ANTHRACIS, CL. CHAUVOEI AND PASTEURELLA N ANIMAL CARCASES WITH A NOTE ON THE RATE OF COOLING OF CARCASES By F. C. MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 27 October 1944) (With two text-figures) PROBLEM of importance in epizootiology, cially in hot countries, is the degree and tion of the infectivity of carcases of animals of disease. This is particularly so with such monly occurring and acute diseases as anthrax, xquarter, haemorrhagic septicaemia where organisms are both numerous and widely ibuted in the body of the animal at the time eath. In such cases not only has contamina- of the immediate surroundings by body charges to be considered, but there is also the widespread distribution of infective material arrion feeders. At the same time, there are mber of questions which should be answered ar knowledge is to be precise. We should some idea not only of the extent of infectivity ie body at the time of death but also whether ogenic bacteria, such as those of the diseases ioned, actually multiply within the body death particularly during the first few hours; to what extent, and what is the influence of ronmental conditions such as atmospheric perature. The effect of air temperature on of heat loss from bodies after death may be prtant in this connection and a note on this ter is included. With an organism producing 100 Multiplication of B. anthracis, etc. Ringer fluid was used as diluent, 1.0 c.c. amounts of each serial suspension being put into each of five plates, then eight drops of sterile heated ox serum and 10 c.c. agar at 48ºC. With anthrax and blackquarter distilled water or saline was the diluent; with the former, three or five poured agar plates and with the latter five tubes of Robertson's meat-liver medium were sown from each serial dilution. In the early experiments a single tube of meat-liver medium was used for each dilution. (The value of this type of medium for supporting the growth of very small numbers of Cl. chauvoei has been shown by Haslam [1920]. The medium was always made up in the same way and usually by the same assistant, Liver broth containing about 2.0 per cent sheep serum, incubated for three days in an anaerobic jar, is also good, growth appearing at the bottom beneath the clear broth. The medium, however, is not quite so good and certainly not so convenient as the meat-liver medium.) When it was desired to know if or to what extent the organisms had sporulated, a portion of the first dilution from the original suspension was heated at 70ºC. for 30 minutes. Counts for Pasteurella were made after 48 hours at 37ºC, deep colonies by that time being elliptical and whitish and surface ones circular smooth and with a bluish tint. Anthrax colonies were counted after 24 hours incubation by which time they are well-developed and of characteristic appearance. Both with Pasteurella and anthrax, plates showing some 100-400 colonies were selected when possible and the counts averaged. Wide discrepancies in counts on plates made from the same dilutions were uncommon and when present the experiment was rejected. The growth of Cl. chauvoei is indicated by gas production and a change in the colour of the meat particles from brown to reddish. Gas production appears to be a particularly reliable index. The final tubes showing growth were carefully noted after 48 and again after 72 hours incubation, Since exudates and suspensions of fresh bone marrow from sheep and goats tend to clot, the original dilution was usually made up in distilled water or saline containing 1.0 per cent sodium citrate. Every endeavour was made to follow the same technique in dealing with tissues removed from the same carcase owing to the necessity of getting comparable results, e.g. with muscular tissue from anthrax carcases the same muscle from the two hind limbs was used. When tissues, other than bone marrow exudates were cultured, the procedure was same in principle. In the case of muscle, i ments totalling 3.0 gm. in weight and as free possible from macroscopically visible blood ves were taken, finely minced in a mortar, thoroughly ground with sand, distilled was added gradually up to 18 c.c. with contin grinding; after a few moments of settling fluid was poured off, the residue again gron further 9 c.c. water added as before and mixed with the 18 c.c. While the identification of Pasteurella anthrax colonies presents no difficulty, this not so with Cl. chauvoei. It is necessary th fore that organisms growing within the can and assumed to be those of blackquarter sh be properly identified. This was done in m cases by cultural and immunity tests. cultural recognition, blood agar slants seeded in series starting with a loopful of m liver culture of the suspected organism, w was known to be free from aerobic contaminat The slants were incubated for 24 hours in anaerobic jar and were then examined in a hand lens.

After withstanding four or such injections of spores, the guinea-pigs wa able to support a subcutaneous injection of c.c. meat-liver culture, 0.2 c.c. 5 per cent cala chloride, mixed with saline up to 1.0 c.c. T weeks or so after this injection the guinea- are ready for use. (A safer method of immum tion is to begin with formalinized meat-li culture.

With blackquarter the films were m bone marrow (guinea-pigs) and the sections in liver (guinea-pigs and sheep). With anthrax, ne marrow films were unsuitable but satisfactory ults were obtained with films from the heart- od of mice, taken first from one side of the heart then from the other. Between the first and ond examination, the carcase was stitched up. 1. Past. septica The strain in use was given to me by Mr V. R. jagopalan, and had been isolated from a bovine mal in 1939. By storage on blood agar under paraffin, it had retained a high virulence for the rabbit, 1.0 c.c. 24-hour broth culture at dilution of 10-4 subcutaneously killing 14-23 hours later. Death would occur with great suddenness, animals apparently well except for a little dullness, would fall on their sides, scream and die after a few struggles. The average number of Pasteurella colonies, developing from 1.0 c.c. bone-marrow suspension at dilution of 10-5 or 10-6 at various times after death is shown in Table I. The unopened carcases were stored in a room at tem- perature maintained between 60 and 70°F. The results indicate that within six hours after death the organism multiplies in the bone marrow. The count then remains stationary up to 48 hours or so, after which the numbers usually start to decline. They are still numerous, however, and in pure culture in the marrow as. long as eight days after death. At the period of maximal growth the mean number of living organisms per gm. bone marrow for 15 rabbits was 2181 millions (range 306-6840, S.D. 1866). In a buffalo calf dying less than 24 hours after inoculation with Pasteurella the count was 1467 millions per gm. of marrow.

102 Multiplication of B. anthracis, etc. 2. B, anthracis Cultural Ten goats, mostly from other experiments, and 14 guinea-pigs were used. With the goats, the time of death after subcutaneous inoculation of approximately the same amount of culture was 31-85 hours (average 49). Within the hour after death one femur was removed and the mar- row cultured at once, the carcase was then placed in a room at air temperature usually between 60 and 70ºF. for 6-24 hours when marrow from the other femur was similarly cultured. In some cases muscle was examined. With some of the guinea-pigs the procedure was rather different; both hind legs were removed, one was put in the cold and the other at a higher temperature, usually 90ºF. After 8 or 24 or more hours the marrow of each was cultured. In order to reduce the chance of haemorrhage at the time of amputation the operation was not performed for an hour or two after death and ligatures were first applied to the upper parts of the limbs. In all this work in spite of every care the results were erratic, most probably because the organism grows in threads and colonies do not develop from single organisms. It is, therefore, unnecessary to give detailed results. Microscopical Since cultural examination gave indecisive results, direct count was attempted of bacilli and chains in the heart-blood of mice and guinea- pigs immediately 'after death and after 6-12 hours storage of the carcase at 90°F. While in the case of mice dying early, viz. within 24 hours of inoculation, the chains had roughly doubled in length during six hours at 90ºF.; similar evidence could not be obtained with guinea-pigs. The results as a whole indicate that multiplication of the anthrax bacillus after death is not a, constant feature. 3. Cl. chauvoei The guinea-pigs and sheep, used for the experi- ments, were inoculated intramuscularly in the thigh with spore suspension or meat-liver culture, with or without calcium chloride. In most cases the sheep carcases were left in a shed at pre- vailing air temperature, while guinea-pig carcases were stored at 28° or 30ºC., the alimentary canal in some cases being removed immediately after death. Cultural results Preliminary experiments on 17 guinea indicated that: (1) At the time of death, unless this is un delayed, the blackquarter orga present in the blood, spleen and marrow are in the vegetative form animals which had been dead hours, e.g. during the previous spores might already have fo in the bone-marrow.

One carcase was into ice immediately after death kept there for 44 hours when multiplication was noted in the marrow. A companion guinea-pig at 28ºC. showed multiplication in tissue.

If fresh xudate, to which citrate has been added, is cubated under a good vaseline seal for 48 hours- t 28ºC., multiplication of the blackquarter rganism may at times be observed. In the above experiments only one tube of meat- ver medium was inoculated from each serial ilution of the tissue but the results were consistent nd indicated substantial increase in the number organisms on storage. To give an idea of the chness in bacteria of tissues and fluids from aimals dead of blackquarter, it may be said that rowth in meat-liver medium was commonly btained from amounts of material as small as ie following: resh heart-blood (guinea-pig) . 0.0002 to 0.00005 gm. resh heart-blood (sheep) . . 0.0002 gm. resh bone-marrow (sheep) . . 0.0002 to 0.00001 gm. resh local lesion exudate (sheep) . 0.000002 gm. resh muscle lesion (sheep) . . 0.0000001 gm. lood from guinea-pig heart after storage of carcase for 24 hours at 30ºC . . . . . 0.000004 gm. lone-marrow from sheep after storage of carcase for 48 hours 0.0000002 gm. The results of a final series of experiments on one-marrow from sheep carcases are shown in Table II. In these, five tubes of meat-liver medium were sown from each serial dilution of suspension covering the expected end point, 1.0 c.c. amounts being added to the culture tubes, nd the probable numbers of organisms present the original tissue suspension being computed from tables given by Halvorson and Ziegler [1933]. appears that (1) the number of organisms resent in the bone-marrow at the time of death aries considerably, (2) of the eleven cases104 Multiplication of B. anthracis, etc. TABLE II Cl. chauvoei in bone-marrow of sheep Hours after death Air temperature (°F.) 49-53 . . 53-60 . . . . . . 51-57 61-65 70 35 . . 55-60 Sheep number 183 100 307 143 74 17 199 84 336 318 228 116 . . . 0 . . 2.31 6.31 4.93 7.0 7.0 17.1 94.3 141.0 27.2 240.0 . . . . . . . 6 . . . . . . . . 1,090.0 . . 918.0 . . . . . . . . 329.0 . . . . . 8 . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 240.0 . . . 30 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 109.0 4.56 . . . 38 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 700.0 240.0 . . . . . . .45 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 171.0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 . . 542.1 329.0 7.29 . . 1,090.0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 700.0 . . . . .. . .

DISCUSSION Mulliplication of pathogenic organisms in ases. Minett and Dhanda [1941] were unable show that anthrax or blackquarter bacteria tiply in soil or in water. The extent of multi- ation in the tissues after death was a matter further enquiry. This subject has some special ortance in India, where the warm climate ours retention of body heat in the freshly-dead nal. This clearly has the effect in the case blackquarter of promoting bacterial multi- ation and early sporulation. Since it must quently happen that some hours elapse before cases are disturbed by carrion feeders, larger bers of bacteria, (such as, Clostridia, Pasteurella) be available for distribution than would erise be the case. The time of day at which th occurs will also obviously be of consequence. h anthrax, multiplication of bacilli in the case was not proved to occur, while on the er hand a higher temperature will presumably our their more rapid disintegration. Like- c, Nunokawa [1910], although his work was inly concerned with another problem, mentions t no substantial multiplication of the anthrax illus could be detected in the dead bodies of ill laboratory animals at 37°C. No data of a quantitative nature bearing on subject have been seen in the literature, ugh some observations relating to black- rter are available. In two papers by Foth [1909, 1910] blackquarter is considered, mainly from the standpoint of differential diagnosis from other diseases of cattle due to Clostridia. He reported incidental observations pointing to growth of the organism in the dead body. Thus with guinea-pigs smears of liver, spleen and kidney from the freshly-dead animal show only a few single rods. After the carcases have lain at room temperature for six hours they are more numerous. At the warmer time of the year there is an abundant increase, though not equally so in all organs and fluids. For this reason, blackquarter carcases undergo putrefaction more slowly, the apparent putrefaction being due to the gas-forming property of the blackquarter organism. In the liver and other organs and the blood the organism sporulates very quickly, especially in the warmer season. Warringsholz and Raszfeld [1924] give a good description of the post-mortem changes occurring in the liver of cattle in blackquarter. Shortly after death the organ is brown-red, blood-rich and soft; some hours later, the liver is dry and contains grey porous pea-sized foci. By 24 hours after death these foci are the size of walnuts or larger, have an ochre tint and a foam-like porous structure. Still later, the whole organ is foamy. Cohrs [1927], dealing with the histology of the liver of cattle dead of blackquarter, states that since the frothy condition of the liver is due to gas production by the organism, some multiplication in that organ must take place. He points out that temperature conditions in the slowly-cooling bodies of large animals are favourable for growth of the bacteria, especially in the liver and kidney which are well-protected. There can, therefore, be little doubt that in the case of blackquarter multiplication takes place after death and prior to sporulation, and the object of work reported in this paper has been to attempt some quantitative expression of the occurrence. No doubt, the results with sheep will apply a fortiori to cattle. One point concerns the duration of the illness. As pointed out by various observers, blackquarter is a septicaemic condition. Leclain- che & Vallée [1900] state that, if animals die quickly from this disease, sporulation may not have occurred. This is certainly true of ex- perimental blackquarter in sheep and guinea- pigs, so far as the blood is concerned. It may further be remarked that these animals often do not die suddenly but are moribund for several hours, a fact which probably influences the state B
108 Multiplication of B. anthracis, etc. of the bacterium in the blood and internal organs. It might be thought that early post-mortem invasion by putrefactive organisms would inhibit the growth of pathogenic organisms in the carcase. Thus, with guinea-pigs dead of blackquarter Leclainche & Vallée [1900] found that the organs were rapidly invaded by Cl. septicum. That has not been experienced in this work, where the only trouble was the occasional develop- ment in the tissues of B. subtilis. As regards anaerobic contamination, my experience agrees with that of Becker [1922] who found that guinea- pigs, killed from causes other than the injection of anaerobes and kept below 23ºC. for less than 24 hours, show no anaerobic bacteria in the subcutaneous tissues, serous cavities or blood. Nevertheless, it is obviously necessary to make a proper identification of anaerobes found in carcases which have been stored in a warm atmos- phere. Body-cooling after death. A freshly-dead body may be likened to a katathermometer. In medical jurisprudence the rate of cooling gives a clue to the time of death and is stated to be almost proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body and that of the surrounding air. The rate in man is commonly put at 4ºF., during the first three hours and 1ºF, each hour afterwards. Brend [1934] gives 2° or 3° F. per hour for the first five hours, then 1°F. per hour. However, these are rough approximations because the rate of cooling is influenced by a number of factors, such as, (a) agePLATE IV [Indian J. Vet. Sci. & Anim.

He interprets the distribution on the basis of mutation and suggests that the Bantu does not descend from the Negro but is rather a pure example of the common stock. An Egyptian origin is suggested for Hottentots. Thomas [1939] reports on blood-group distri- bution in England. Out of 5,000 people, 2,233 were of group O, 2,162 of A, 444 of B and 161 of AB group. Haldane [1940] studied the blood- group frequencies of 75 European population groups. A striking variation was discovered in the frequencies of A and O groups, among the peripheral population of Western Europe, there being a low proportion of group B in Scandinavia, Iceland, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia and the British Isles. Populations with low B are regarded as remnants of a primitive European civilization. In India, Malone and Laheri [1929] studied three types of people, (1) Turko-Iranians, (2) Indo- Aryans and (3) Dravidians. They confirm the find- ings of Hirschfeld in concluding that these people are characterized by a high incidence of group B. The Dravidians are also characterized by a high incidence of group A. Macfarlane [1938] studied the blood-group distribution in Bengal. Data from lower Bengal show that the frequency of groups A and B increases as one passes from higher to lower castes, the highest frequency of group O being found among caste Hindus. Bengalee depressed classes have the highest percentage of group B so far found in India. Bengalee-Muslims have a blood-group distribution similar to that of their low-class Hindu neighbours. Macfarlane [1940] also studied the problem in Baster State and found a high frequency of group B among the Bhils, this being regarded as due to in-breeding. Almost all the Chenchus of Baster State belonged to groups O and A and in this respect resemble the hill tribes of the Western Ghats and the Malyali lower castes, so sharing the distinction of being the only Indian tribe with more group A than B, Sarkar [1940], in 96 tests on certain primitive people of India, Huyani nagas (Assam and Bihar), showed the predominance of group A over B, excepting among the Thado-Kukis. Greval and Chandra [1940] tested Hindus, Muslims and Anglo- Indians of Calcutta. A high frequency of groups O and B was found in Hindus and Muslims, where- as group A was the highest and B the lowest among the Anglo-Indians. Sheshadhari-Nathan and Timothy [1942] carried out a similar investi- gation in Madras. Group O was the highest B lowest among the Anglo-Indians. Pai [1934] found a high frequency of group B am Todas (Guindy, Madras). The technique used in the blood-grouping ti was the same as that described in the auth previous article [Singh, 1942]. It consisted mixing in a small tube about four drops of se and an equal amount of 2 per cent washed cell suspension, gently mixing and exposing mixture at 37°C. (dry incubator) for 30-60 min Cattle of the following breeds were select for study: Kumauni (hill), Sindhi, Gir, Sahi Tharparkar, Hariana, Kankrej, Amritmal Kangayam, Ongole, Dhanni, Afghan and Friesi The distribution and location of these bre can be seen in Fig. 1 from which it is evident t they are subject to a wide range of climatic other environmental factors. In this work there are three main sources difficulty: (a) the low and quickly deteriorat titre of the serum. (This difficulty does not a in blood-group work with human sera, which w cold storage can be used for some days), (b) necessity of carrying out the tests at 37ºC. a (c) the number of antigenic components in t erythrocytes of cattle. The location of some the cattle in places where there are special tra port difficulties was an additional hindran For these reasons the results recorded here a not as detailed as might be desired and the obje has rather been to determine certain broad fa regarding the blood affinities. The usual practice was to bleed 12 animals the morning, test the 144 combinations of seru and cells, and read the results the same evening The results largely depended on the partialis antigenic components present in the blood of in dividuals of the group tested on one day. Occ sionally, cells and serum from an animal found be a good reactor on the previous day were it cluded, in order to increase the chances of obtain ing positive reactions. The reason for this is tha a few cattle, giving no reactions with serum an cells from one lot of animals, may exhibit positive reactions with isogen or isonin* or with both thes components when tested with serum and cell from another lot. In this way the group classi fication first recorded had to be altered after further test, though this was not frequent. * Isohaemagglutinins and Isofaemagglutinogens will be termed isonins and isogens, after Greval et al [1941].

Map showing the location of various cattle breeds in India RESULTS The results of the tests will be found in Tables I-V and in Fig. 2. 1. Kumauni hill cattle. The home of this breed is the Kumaun foot-hills of the Himalaya. It is one of the smallest breeds of Indian cattle, with short horns and a thoracic musculo-fatty hump. The poll and hump are usually covered with coarse hairs; the sheath is tight and the legs are short, thick and bony. The colour is generally deep-red or jet-black, and an admixture with white is regarded as indicating crossing with grey cattle of the plains. The experiments were conducted at Mukteswar, where many pure Kumauni cattle are available. The animals were collected from various Kumauni hills and may therefore be regarded as of divergent strains. In order to differentiate A and B groups, 24 of the reactors were selected and their isonins were cross-tested with their isogens. The results are given in Table I.

This breed resides in the country th east of Kutch, extending from the south- st corner of the Tharparker districts of Sind to amedabad in Bombay and from Deesa in the east Radhanpur State in the west, particularly along e Banas and Saraswati rivers. They are fast and werful draught cattle. In the past they have en exported to South America and other tropical untries in order to maintain the constitution of e local cattle by introduction of Zebu blood. me Kankrej has been said to be instrumental in formation of beef breeds in these countries. hey are lyre-horned cattle. Cows are fairly )d milkers. The Kankrej is a thoroughly well- ablished breed which has been maintained pure generations. They carry the head in a raised osition, hence the name 'Proud Kankrej'. he colour is generally grey to iron grey, growing hite with age. The blood-grouping experiments were conducted the Northcote Cattle Farm at Chharodi. Most the animals were farm-bred and may be regarded inbred cattle for the purpose of this study. 8. Amritmahal. This is a breed of Mysore State, here the animals are bred under Government ontrol and their sale usually restricted. Subsist- nce is entirely by forest grazing. They are mong the best and fastest draught cattle in ndia, and are particularly useful for army trans- ort. They have long and pointed horns arising close ogether and extending backwards and upwards. they belong to Ware's group IV. The colour aries from light to deep iron-grey, with a darker most black shade over the shoulders and hind quarters in the case of bulls. Bullocks and es- ecially older ones appear white, while the cows re generally white or at times light grey. Calves t birth are mostly red or light-red. The tests were carried out at the Cattle-Breed- ng Station, Ajjampur, Mysore State. 9. Kangayam. This is a breed of the south- astern taluks of Coimbatore, Madras. Animals of this breed are bred on scientific lines at the Live- stock Research Station, Hosur. There is also a long- astablished herd maintained by. a private breeder, the Pattagar of Palayakottai. The breed is Suitable for light plough and transport work and economical to maintain. The cows are generally oor milkers. The horns arise fairly close together find extend slightly backwards and upwards. The colour is generally light-grey but changes to white with age. Bulls sometimes show iron- grey patches over the front and hind quarters. Calves when born are red but later change to light-grey colour. One hundred adults were tested at Hosur. Most of them were farm-bred and are thus inbred for the purpose of this work. 10. Ongole. The home of this breed is the Guntur district and neighbouring area of Madras. It is one of the large breeds of Indian cattle and greatly resembles the Hariana. The animals are, however, comparatively lethargic, and useful for heavy plough and transport work. The cows are fairly good milkers. They have short horns. In colour, they are mostly white but a small pro- portion are of a light grey colour. The bulls generally show a light shade of grey over the quarters. Ninety-six adults were tested at the Livestock Research Station, Guntur. Most of them were farm-bred and so inbred for our purposes. 11. Dhanni. This breed lives in the northern Punjab, in an area of undulating valleys at an average altitude of 1,500 feet. The climate is generally very cold during the winter and fairly hot in summer. It is a fast and light plough animal and fetches high prices. The cows are generally poor milkers. The horns are short. The coat colour of the body of the so-called pure Dhanni-bred animal is white with black spots, while the skin colour and tuft of the tail are in- variably white. Ninety-nine animals were tested at Chakwal, Daulatala and Gujarkhan. As they had been collected from different sources, they may be regarded as of divergent strain. 12. Friesian and Friesian-Sahiwal cross. Tests on 86 animals were made at the Military Farms at Sialkot and Lahore. Some were pure- bred and recently imported from Europe, others were pure Friesians born in India. The remainder were crossed with Sahiwals. Results of the tests have been given in Table IV. The frequency of A and B groups in pure-bred Friesians is much higher than usual, 13. Afghan. The original home of this breed is Afghanistan. A few of these cattle were pre- sented by the Afghan Government to H. E. the Viceroy and have since been kept at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, where they have developed into a small herd. Nine- teen cattle could be brought under experiment. The results are given in Table V.

Blood-group distribution of 13 breeds of cattle in India Discussion The value of blood-grouping for determining questions of heredity has been established by various workers. It has been found that in any race in the absence of crossing the proportion of groups remains constant from one generation to another. By crossing, a definite change in the normal proportion of groups is brought about. Before discussing the results obtained in this study, it is worth while repeating Snyder's [1930] pos- tulates on the subject, which are as follows: 1. Any people whose blood-group distri- bution is studied shows blood-group frequencies similar to those of other people known to be related to it. 2. If any people shows blood-group frequencies different from those based on the frequencies of peoples known to be related to it, the conclusion may be drawn that the former has undergone racial crossings which the latter have not undergone or vice versa. 3. If any people shows blood-group frequency similar to a group of people not known to be related to it the conclusion may be drawn that the former traces back to the latter somewhere in its ancestry or the former has undergone crossing with the latter group or some similar people. 4. If any people lacks one or both of the blood- group mutations as evidenced by an extremely low value of p or g it may be assumed that this people became isolated from the rest of mankind before the respective mutations took place or before they spread very far. Limitations of time and space preclude the possibility at this stage of our work of drawing a thoroughly comprehensive picture of the relation- ship of the various Indian cattle. It is hoped that data provided here will form the basis for further work and indicate lines of research. Nevertheless, certain interesting points emerge, which may be discussed briefly. Kumauni hill breed. The blood-group frequencies of this breed reveal striking differences from those of the other Indian breeds so far tested. The absence of relationship to any other Indian breed, particularly in the non-appearance of group O, suggests a distinct origin. The Mongolian wave of immigration (Census of India, 1931 I(1) ) from the Chino-Tibetan border into the Himalaya, Assam and Burma may have been instrumental in introducing these cattle into these ranges. C 2
118 Blood-Group Identifications of Indian Breeds These small cattle are confined to the Himalayan sub-ranges and these are connected with the Tibet- an ranges. It would be interesting to study the blood-groupings of Tibetan and other Mongolian breeds of cattle, or at least other Himalayan hill cattle in India, to see whether geographical proximity has provided the means of importation, adaptation and spread of these cattle in the Himalayan ranges. Their blood-group simi- larity with Friesians is suggestive, but no solid hypothesis is possible because few of the latter could be tested. It is intriguing however to find that both Friesian and Kumauni cattle are decidedly more susceptible to rinderpest than other breeds. Sahiwal, Afghan, Gir and Red Sindhi. These breeds reveal a striking preponderance of group O, and an equally low frequency of groups A and B (mixed). This clearly establishes a close inter- relationship among these breeds and supports Olver's hypothesis, that the Sahiwal and Sindhi breeds are derived from contact with Afghan and Gir cattle. It is further established that their origin is distinct from the white-grey cattle of India. Kankrej, Ongole and Hariana. In all these breeds there is a very low frequency of group O, whereas AB frequencies are fairly high and there is great similarity as regards group IV (negative). The Hariana cattle, tested at Hissar, it is understood, have a small admixture of Kankrej blood. In spite of this, there is a greater affinity between the Hariana and Ongole as regards group O and AB. Geographically, these two breeds are widely separated, the Ongole being confined to a small tract near the eastern coast of south India. These animals have no morphological similarity with any of the neighbouring breeds. Hariana cattle are situated well to the north, but show marked resemblance to the Ongole breed. The blood- group findings again provide support to the views of Olver and of Ware, as to the common origin of these breeds. The Dhanni breed. This breed shows a fairly high frequency 0. This factor and the location of these cattle, on the route from Afghanistan to India, suggest the incorporation of blood from Afghan or some allied breed during their evolu- tion. The Tharparker breed. This has a fairly high frequency of group O and A and B (mixed), and this suggests that the breed is a cross between the grey and Gir types of cattle. Observations on a large number of cattle of this breed revea much variation in cranial formation. On m phological and serological grounds, these cat cannot be granted the rank of a regular bre Further investigations, however, may throw m light on the matter. Amritmahal. This famous breed falls into group comprising the Kangayam, Ongole Kankrej breeds. The blood-group relationship to these three breeds are too close to be ignore and this raises the interesting possibility that breed may not after all have been imported a separate migration wave, but may be the outco of the magnificient efforts of the rulers of Mys to evolve an army transport beast by the crossi of local south India cattle (Kangayam bree with grey-white cattle (Ongole-Kankrej). Oth wise, there must be some common ancestry their original home. Summary 1. The blood-group distribution of 11 Indi and two foreign breeds, comprising 1,199 head cattle, has been studied. With the exception Friesians, all the cattle tested were of Zebu ty 2. The final blood-grouping by percentag is: group O, 26-8; group A and B (mixed), 8 group AB, 36 and group IV (negative), 28.8. T blood-group frequencies for each breed beha as independent units and indicate possible ori and relationship with other breeds. 3. Gir, Red Sindhi, Sahiwal and Afghan cat show a similarity in blood-grouping, especially respect of the high frequency of group O, so th these four breeds may be regarded as related Hariana, Ongole, Kankrej and Amritmal were also very similar to one another and so m be from the same stock or closely related. Dhanni, Tharparker and Kangayam bree represent intermediate types. Kumauni hill cattle appear to be a separ entity in India. Their blood-group similar to that of Friesian cattle and the high suscep bility of both these breeds to rinderpest has be pointed out. 4. A blood-grouping classification for Indi cattle has been provisionally fixed, and a differe tiation of A and B groups by absorption te has been made. The ratio of groups A and in Kumauni hill cattle was 2:1. 5. Attention has been called to the geographi distribution and morphological characters of Indi breeds.

Minett, and my thanks are due to him for his close superivsion and assis- tance in writing this paper. My thanks are also due to Mr S. R. Hasan for facilitating research. It is also a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance of the following:120 Composition of the Blood of Farm Animals in India [1913] found that the average iodine-content of the healthy thyroid of cattle from June to Novem- ber was about three times that from December to May. In India, especially in the north, there is a vast difference between the winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures. At Izatnagar, the summer maximum reaches 115ºF. and the winter minimum may be 42ºF. EXPERIMENTAL The experimental animals were normal adult cows of the Hariana breed belonging to the Izatnagar Dairy-Farm. They were selected because their blood constituents had remained constant under various normal physiological conditions [Mullick and Pal, 1943]. Feeding and management were under supervision. All had been immunized against rinderpest and were tuberculin- negative; they remained in sound health through- out the observations (November 1941 to October 1942). Since proposed fortnightly examinations were not possible, analyses were made monthly. Blood samples were taken in the morning before feeding and at practically the same period even month. Oxalated blood was analysed for re cells, white cells, hæmoglobin, cell volume, iron inorganic phosphorus, sugar and cholesterol Calcium, magnesium, protein and non-protein nitrogens were estimated in the serum. Samples for inorganic phosphorus and sugar were depro teinized at the spot of bleeding. METHODS Cell-volume, cholesterol, protein and non-protein nitrogens were determined by the methods Napier and Das Gupta [1941], Banerjee [1937 and Kjeldahl [1883], respectively. The rest the constituents were analysed according to the methods described in Part I [Mullick and Pal 1943]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The average readings of all the animals for each month are given in Table I, of individual animals for 12 months and the results of statistical analysis in Table II.

From the tables, it will be seen that the average values remained practically constant throughout the year. However, highly significant differences were found among individual animals. Hæmoglobin. Highly significant differences existed in the monthly averages as well as in the means of individual animals. Monthly averages declined gradually from February to June, and from July they started to increase. It appears that the concentration of hæmoglobin is inversely proportional to the change of atmospheric tem- perature. In South Africa, Hammersma [1937] studied the seasonal variation of hæmoglobin in animals and found no significant variation in monthly averages. Manresa and Orig [1941] in the Philippines observed that the hæmoglobin concentration in experimental animals was higher in winter than in summer. In the United States Bazett Sunderman, Doupe and Scott [1940], working on human subjects, found that a slight variation in the temperature of the experimental chamber resulted in variation in the concentration of blood constituents, the trend of changes being similar to that observed by us. Cell-volume. The variation of cell-volume as a result of change in air temperature resembled that of hæmoglobin. Statistical analysis showed that there was highly significant difference among the monthly averages as well as among the means of individual animals. This value was inversely proportional to the change of temperature. The variation in the composition of body-fluid with seasonal change helps heat-regulation in the animal. In summer, the secretions of thyroxine and adrenaline temporarily inhibit dilation of the cutaneous capillaries and the increase in plasma volume helps in giving out the body heat formed in excess [Kuno. 1935].
122 Composition of the Blood of Farm Animals in India Mean corpuscular volume. The average monthly values showed highly significant variations, but the means of individual animals did not differ significantly. Monthly variation was similar to that of cell-volume. Mean corpuscular hæmoglobin. Highly signi- ficant differences existed among the monthly averages as well as in individual animals. The values were higher in winter than summer. Mean corpuscular hæmoglobin concentration. The average values showed no significant variation in the various months or in the individual animals. The change in both hæmoglobin and cell-volume was shown to be proportional. Iron. There were highly significant differences among the monthly averages and in individual animals. No seasonal variation was noted by Hammersma [1937] in South African animals. Considering the close relationship between hæmoglobin and iron, it might have been expected that variation in iron would be similar to that of hæmoglobin. Inorganic phosphorus. There was no significant difference among the monthly averages but mean values of the individual animal differed signifi- cantly. Sugar. The mean values showed no significant differences in the monthly observations or in individual animals. Cholesterol. Neither the monthly averages nor the means of the individual animals varied signi- ficantly. Ghosh [1933] came to a similar conclu- sion from a statistical study of the seasonal varia- tion in human blood. Calcium. There were highly significant differ- ences in both the means of monthly observations and in the averages of individual animals. Month- ly values gradually increased with rise of tempera- ture in summer and gradually decreased with the advance of winter. Hammersma [1937] noted similar changes in cattle, but the difference was not statistically significant. Craige and Godd [1941] found the calcium content of horse's serum to be at its maximum in summer. Magnesium. Highly significant differences existed among the monthly averages as well as in individual animals. Duncun, Lightfoot and Huff- man [1940] noted also that this constituent differed significantly from month to month, winter values being greater than summer ones. Protein and non-protein nitrogen. Neither the average monthly values nor the means of individual animals were found to be significantly different. Hammersma's [1937] findings were similar to ours, SUMMARY Whole-blood and serum of a group of normal cows were analysed for morphological and chemical constituents over a period of 12 months. Oxalated blood was examined for red cells, white cells, hæmoglobin, cell-volume, iron, inorganic phos- phorus, sugar and cholesterol. Calcium, magne- sium, protein and non-protein nitrogen were determined in serum. Different corpuscular values were calculated from red cell counts, hæmoglobin and cell volume. In the morphological series, hæmoglobin and cell-volume exhibited significant seasonal variations, whereas in the chemical series monthly averages for iron, calcium and magnesium showed significant differences. In the former series, the average values were highest in winter, whereas in the latter series they were highest in summer. The remaining constituents, both in the morphological and chemical series, showed no significant differences in their monthly averages. Practically all the constituents differed significantly in individual animals. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We wish to express our gratitude to Dr K. C.

THE COMPARATIVE VALUE OF SOME CONCENTRATES IN THE FEED OF GROWING CATTLE By N. C. DAS GUPTA, Research Officer, Cattle Feeding Research Station, Bharari, Jhansi (Received for publication on 2 February 1945) (With one text-figure) CONCENTRATES can be broadly classified into three groups according to the composition. Lin- seed cake, decorticated and undecorticated ground- nut cakes, til (Sesamum indicum) cake, rape cake, cottonseed cake and guar (Cyamopsis psoralioides) are the common concentrates of India, having a protein content of over 30 per cent. Coconut cake, cotton seed, pulses (legume seeds) and pulse by-products are moderately rich in protein and have nutritive ratios similar to the standard required for production. Cereal grains make the third group of concentrates which are comparatively rich in carbohydrates but low in protein content. This paper deals with the feeding value, for the production of growth, of five oil cakes, viz. linseed cake, decorticated and undecorticated groundnut cakes, rape cake and til cake and four legume seeds or their by-products, viz. guar, gram (Cicer trietinum), arhar (Cajanus indicus) chuni and mung Phaseolus mungo) chuni. The chuni is the by- product from the manufacture of split pulse (dal) or human consumption. It contains chiefly the hulls, along with the germs and broken parti- cles of the seed. In all the tests of this series, unseed cake was used as the control, because it is one of the most popular protein supplements or cattle and produces good results even when used as the only concentrate. FEEDING TRIAL WITH LINSEED CAKE, UNDECOR- TICATED GROUNDNUT CAKE, GRAM AND ARHAR chuni (1940) In August 1940, tests to find out the comparative feeding values of linseed cake, undecorticated groundnut cake, gram and arhar chuni for growth were started with 20 Hissar heifers. The basal ation, which consisted of wheat straw ad lib., 1lb. jowar (Sorghum vulgare) silage, 1.55 lb. wheat ran and linseed cake for protein supplement, was fed to all the animals for a period of eight weeks and thereafter they were distributed into our comparable groups according to age, live- weight and rate of growth during the basal period. For the experimental feeding, group I was allowed to continue the basal ration and groups II, III and IV received groundnut cake, gram and arhar chuni respectively in place of linseed cake, the quantity being regulated to maintain the same level of protein for different groups. Records of daily liveweight and food consumption for each animal were maintained during the test which lasted for a period of 21 weeks. The distribution of animals for the different treatments and their liveweight increase during the experimental period have been recorded in Table I. Rate of growth with the different rations. The rate of growth by the different treatments has been statistically analysed and the summary of the results is shown in Table II. Undecorticated groundnut cake produced the lowest average growth rate. Linseed cake came next and, though the average growth rate is very signi- ficantly higher than that with groundnut cake, it is lower than that with gram and arhar chuni. The difference between gram and arhar chuni is not significant. The fall in the growth rate from gram to linseed cake is 19.48 per cent, from gram to groundnut cake is 53.60 per cent, and from linseed cake to groundnut cake 34.12 per cent, the critical difference at 5 per cent level being 12.97 per cent. Similarly, between arhar chuni and linseed cake and between arhar chuni and undecorticated groundnut cake the differences in the average growth rates are 23.35 and 57.47 per cent respectively, the critical difference being 14.50 per cent. The variations due to treatments in the case of average rate of change of growth rate is also significant. FEEDING TRIAL WITH LINSEED CAKE, DECORTI- CATED GROUNDNUT CAKE, RAPE CAKE AND MUNG chuni (1941) Sixteen Hissar heifers were selected for this test in September, 1941. The basal ration was the same as in the previous test, except that rape cake was fed instead of linseed cake during this period as it was found that animals do not relish 123 D

One group was allowed to continue the rape cake ration, and for the other three groups rape cake was replaced by either linseed cake, groundnut cake or mung chuni. The procedure was the same as in the previous test. The distri- bution of the animals for the different treatments and the gain in their liveweights during the 18 weeks of experiment are shown in Table III. Rate of growth. The results of the statistical analysis have been summarized in Table IV. Decorticated groundnut cake has produced signi- ficantly the lowest average growth rate. Rape TABLE III Distribution of animals into groups and their average liveweight (lb.) cake and linseed cake come next in order and the difference between them is not significant, but both produced significantly lower growth rate than mung chuni, the average growth rates per week with these feeds being 4.96, 6.30, 6.84 and 8.72 lb. respectively. The fall in the growth rate from mung chuni to rape cake is 36.03 per cent, from mung chuni to groundnut cake is 56.04 per cent, and from rape cake to groundnut cake 20.01 per cent, the critical difference at 5 per cent level being 19.64 per cent. Similarly, from mung chuni to linseed cake and from linseed cake to groundnut cake, the fall in the average growth rate is 27.90 and 28.14 per cent respectively.

It is observed that the rate of growth with til cake is significantly lower than that with linseed cake or guar. The fall in the rate of growth from linseed cake to til cake is 25.49 per cent and from guar to til cake 43.18 per cent. Guar has produced the highest rate of growth and the fall in the rate of growth from guar to linseed cake is 17.69 per cent, but it is not significant being less than the critical difference of 24.59 per cent.

The curves for groundnut cakes, both decorticated and undecorticated, rape cake and til cake are less steeply inclined than those with linseed cake. Better rates of growth are to be found with arhar chuni, gram, mung chuni and guar. These findings are substantially confirmed by the statistical analysis. The data obtained during the three years of experiment have been analysed to study the comparative feeding value of the concentrates. The summary of the results is shown in Table VII. The differences in the rates of growth obtained with linseed cake during the three experiments are not significant yet they are not the same which may be due to seasonal variations or other factors during the three different years. It is observed from Table VII that the average rates of growth with undecorticated and decorticated groundnut cakes are not significantly different from that with til cake but are significantly lower than that with the remaining concentrates. The growth rate with til cake is not significantly different from that with rape cake, but is lower than those with lin- seed cake, guar, gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni. The growth with rape cake is not signi- ficantly lower than that with linseed cake, but is lower than the figures obtained for guar, gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni. The rate of growth with linseed cakes is not significantly different from that with guar, but is lower than those with gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni. The differences obtained among guar, gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni are not significant.

130 Comparative Value of Some Concentrates Smaller quantities of concentrates richer in protein were fed to maintain the same level of pro- tein for all the treatments, and it is noted that the consumption of total dry matter was also lower in these groups. Concentrates and coarse fodders were fed separately. Where the quantity of concentrate was comparatively higher, as with arhar chuni and mung chuni, the intake of wheat straw was slightly lower, but in most of the treat- ments its intake, though fed ad lib, did not appre- ciably increase with the lower amount of concen- trates, which indicates that the animals were usually satiated with the average total dry matter consumed in the oil cake treatments, Thus it appears that on an average 2.22 lb. total dry matter per 100 lb. liveweight is necessary for Hissar heifers between one and two years of age and weighing between 400 and 500 lb., but the rate of consumption may be higher if the ration consists mostly of palatable feeds. In the mung chuni treatment, the average consumption per 100 lb. liveweight was as high as 2.60 lb. The higher intake of dry matter must have influenced to some extent, the better growth rate with guan gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni. Effect of the concentrate on the digestibility of the total ration. Digestibility trials were conducted with three animals under each treatment during 1940 and 1941 and with two animals in 1942. The average digestibility coefficients of the nutrients of the total ration for each treatment have been recorded in Table X.

This indicates that the concentration of a nutrient in the total ration plays an important role in its digestibility. The level of protein was the same in all the treatments, but due to a lower intake of total dry matter the concentration of protein was higher in the treatments with feeds richer in protein, resulting in its better digestibi- lity. The same tendency is noticed with the digestibility of ether extract. Similar observa- tions were made by the author [1943] on a previous occasion. The lower digestibility of protein of the total ration with gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni might also have been influenced by the presence of more easily digestible carbohydrates. Gain in liveweight in relation to the intake of digestible nutrients. The increases in liveweight per unit of digestible protein and total digestible nutrients have been calculated (Table XI) to com- pare the feeding value of the nutrients from the different concentrates. The pulses and pulse by- products have always given higher increase in
N. C. DAS GUPTA 131 liveweight per unit of digestible protein. This eater increase cannot be attributed only to the uality of protein, as more carbohydrates also had to be ingested as a result of maintaining the same level of protein in these treatments. Balanc- ing of both protein and carbohydrates, which is necessary for such experiments, is only possible by supplementing purified diets, but this is not practicable specially with dairy cattle, in long period feeding trials. In the experiment during 1940, the actual amount of protein digested was lower than the calculated quantity given to the animals of gram and arhar chuni groups, and hence, the level of protein supplement was lower for these two treatments. But the increase in liveweight per unit of total digestible nutrients was the same even with this lower protein supple- ment. Mung chuni and guar in 1941 and 1942 respectively have produced decidedly better rate of growth per unit of both digestible protein and total digestible nutrients. Thus it appears that for growing animals protein from gram, arhar chuni, mung chuni or guar is superior to that from the oilcakes.

Hence, to compare the cost of production with the different concentrates, the prices of all the roughages and bran have been taken as the same as in 1941 and those of the concentrates have been modified and brought to the 1941 level on the basis of variation of the price of linseed cake from year to year. The comparative cost of the total ration for the production of 100 lb. live- weight (Table XII) show that for production of the same liveweight rape cake is the cheapest amongst all the concentrates, next in order come groundnut cake (decorticated), guar, mung chuni, linseed cake, til cake, arhar chuni, groundnut cake (undecorticated) and gram. The comparative economic value of a feed cannot be assessed only by the market prices which always vary. Therefore the quantities of different concentrates which produce the same increase in liveweight have been shown in the last column (Table XII). But for true economy the time factor should also be taken into account as with better rate of growth, the period of unproduc- tiveness is shortened. It appears that when the rate of growth is taken into account guar is defi- nitely more economical than the oilcakes, and both arhar chuni and mung chuni may also prove cheaper in the long run.

The tests were carried out in three sets during 1940, 1941 and 1942. Linseed cake was used as control in all the sets. Varying quantities of the different con- centrates were fed to maintain the same level of protein in all the treatments. In the first test, it was found that gram and arhar chuni produced better growth than linseed cake, while undecorticated groundnut cake proved inferior. Among the concentrates tested in the second year, mung chuni gave the highest rate of growth, followed in order by linseed cake, rape cake and decorticated groundnut cake. The difference in the growth rates with linseed cake and rape cake was not significant. In the third set, the growth rates were in the decreasing order of guar, linseed cake and til cake. On comparing the data for all the concentrates, it was found that under the conditions of these experiments groundnut cakes both decorticated and undecorticated resulted in the least favourable rate of growth. Til cake and rape cake came next in order of increasing value, followed by linseed cake. Linseed cake was of about the same value as guar and was inferior only to gram, arhar chuni and mung chuni which gave the best results. The digestibility of organic matter and total carbohydrate was higher when pulse or pulse chuni was present in the ration, while that of protein was superior when the concentrates richer in protein were fed. This variation appears to be due to the concentration of the nutrient in the total ration. Protein of gram, arhar chuni, mung chuni and guar appears to be of superior quality as compared to that of the oilcakes for growing Hissar cattle. Mung chuni and guar produced the best rates of growth per unit of total digestible nutrients as well. For the production of the same liveweight rape cake has been found to be the cheapest. Next in order come decorticated groundnut cake, guar, mung chuni, linseed cake, til cake, arhar chuni, undecorticated groundnut cake and gram. But when the rate of growth is taken into account, which determines the period of unproductiveness the feeding of guar is definitely more economical than the oilcakes and both arhar chuni and mung chuni may also prove cheaper in the long run. With normal feeds, the consumption of dry matter for Hissar heifers weighing between 400 and 500 lb. is, on an average, 2.2 lb. per 100 lb. liveweight.

DIGESTIBILITY AND NUTRITIVE VALUE OF BAGOMOLASSES By S. C. RAY and S. K. TALAPATRA, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 27 January 1945) WITH the extensive development of sugar in- dustry in this country, the economic disposal of a large quantity of molasses in every crushing season has become a problem for urgent consideration. Of late, attempts have been made to open up several avenues of economic utilization of mo- lasses. One of these is its possible use as a cattle-feed. The Imperial Institute of Sugar Technology had been, for some time past, manufacturing a cattle feed containing a substantial quantity of molasses. It was prepared by mixing dried bagasse screenings and protein concentrate (made of chunni and an oilcake) with boiled molasses. The mixture was pressed into a cake and was named as 'molasscuit'. Some feeding tests with molasscuit were carried out at several centres. Preliminary reports of these trials were some- what contradictory as to the suitability of molass- unit as a cattle feed. The manufacture of molassed feed containing protein concentrate was eventually dropped and the Imperial Institute of Sugar Technology is now producing a new feed very similar to the foregoing in general make- up but containing no protein supplement. The new feed has been named 'bagomolasses', and is made up of one part bagasse screenings mixed with two parts of molasses. This paper embodies the results of experiments carried out with a view (1) to record any character- istic behaviour shown by experimental animals kept on a ration containing bagomolasses, (2) to study the effect of incorporating bagomolasses on consumption, digestion and utilization of a main- tenance ration by bullocks, and (3) to evaluate the digestibility coefficients and nutritive value of bagomolasses. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS OF FEEDING BAGOMO- LASSES TO CATTLE At the outset, it was found necessary to con- duct a number of preliminary feeding trials to fix the maximum quantity of bagomolasses which could be fed with ease and without inducing any ill-effect in the animals. At first, the animals showed a good appetite for the semi-dry bago- molasses, which, however, gradually waned and after about two to three weeks the animals simply licked and nibbled the food intermittently. It was eventually observed that bagomolasses could be fed for a longer time, if it was soaked in water before offering to the animals. Though this procedure offered good promise, it was later found that even after soaking the consumption of bagomolasses was not high enough to warrant its inclusion in a ration. The next step followed was to feed bagomolasses mixed with a bulky concentrate such as wheat bran. The mixture, as before, was fed after soaking. This procedure was quite successful and the animals could be E2
134 Bagomolasses as Cattle Feed induced to eat 4 lb. of bagomolasses without any difficulty. As feeding of bagomolasses was found to be accompanied by excessive diuresis, other points of importance recorded in this connection were, that the animals must have free access to common salt and more frequent watering than usual. Diuresis in cattle has been noted by Warth [1926] and recently by Sen, Ray and Talapatra [1942] in animals fed on paddy-straw. According to these authors, diuresis is induced by the large quantity of potassium salt present in paddy-straw. Cane-molasses is also rich in potassium (about 2.62 per cent on dry basis) and it is likely that the observed diuresis is due to the high amount of potassium present in bagomo- lasses which contains two-third of its weight of molasses. In this connection, an experiment was designed to study the effect of withdrawal of salt from the ration containing bagomolasses on the general condition of experimental animals. The effect of the withdrawal of the salt was quick and marked. Within two weeks of salt-starva- tion, there was a significant drop both in body- weight and food consumption. On the average, the animals lost 17 per cent of their body weight and the food consumption decreased by about 22 per cent in terms of dry matter. As soon as the animals were given free access to common salt, its consumption during the week following the complete deprivation of salt was on the aver- age 2.6 oz. per day per animal of about 500 lb. body-weight. With progressive feeding this high consumption of salt gradually decreased to the normal consumption of 1.5 oz. per animal per day. It is apparent from the foregoing evidence that even the normal requirement of common salt in cattle is high when bagomolasses is in- corporated in the ration. With the increased intake of common salt, the diuresis was noticed to be considerably reduced. Singh and Singh [1934, 1935] have recorded that when molasses was fed to working bullocks which were not given common salt, the animals often showed froth salivation. When these animals were allowed free access to salt, the trouble disappeared com- pletely. EFFECT OF INCORPORATING BACOMOLASSES OF THE CONSUMPTION, DIGESTION AND UTILIZATION OF A RATION Experimental For this experiment four country bullocks, eacb weighing about 500 lb., were used. At first all the animals gained in weight for a short period and gradually settled down to a more or less station any weight which averaged 550 lb. ±10 lb. In order to make a comparative study, the who investigation has been divided into two distinct periods. In period 1, the ration consisted of wheat-bhusa of known nutritive value fed a lib and a fixed amount of wheat-bran of unknown nutritive value (with no bagomolasses). During period 2, the ration was changed and was made up of equivalent amount of the same wheat- bran mixed with 4 lb. of bagomolasses and the same wheat-bhusa fed ad lib. The mixture of bran and bagomolasses was fed after soaking in water. In both the periods, the animals had free access to common salt. Each test-ration fed in periods 1 and 2 was continued first for a prelimi- nary period of four to six weeks followed by a ten-day quantitative collection of excreta and of any food residue left, for subsequent chemical analysis. The percentage composition of the feeding stuffs used during the experiment is given in Table I. Table II shows the dry matter consumption under each feeding test. The nutrients consumed from the feeds and voided in the faeces are detailed in Tables III and IV.

TALAPATRA 139 The above calculation, the digestibility coefficient of bagomolasses for each animal has been set out an Table VII. The data in Table VII indicate that the average digestibility of organic matter in bagomolasses is 69. Amongst the constituents of organic matter neither the crude protein nor the ether extract is at all digestible. The diges- tibility coefficient of total carbohydrates, on the other hand, is fairly high, the average being 72. From the digestibility coefficient values thus obtained, the total digestible nutrients and starch equivalent values per 100 lb. of the raw material have been calculated to be 47.0 lb. and 36.9 lb. respectively. It may be of interest to compare the total digestible nutrients and starch equivalent values of bagomolasses with those of the common feeding stuffs available in this country. This is done in Table VIII and it will be seen that the nutritive value of bagomolasses approximates that of gram husk. Bagomolasses is definitely superior in feeding value to common roughages like wheat and paddy straw. TABLE VII Digestibility coefficient of bagomolasses Animal Organic matter Crude protein Ether extract Total carbohydrates Bullock140 Bagomolasses as Cattle Feed coefficient of its total carbohydrates is 72. From the values of digestibility coefficients determined, the total digestible nutrients and starch equiva- lent calculated per 100 lb. of the raw material are 47.0 lb. and 36.9 lb. respectively. In nutri- tive value, bagomolasses is thus comparable to gram husk. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to thank Dr K. C. Sen, D.

ZUBERY, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute Izatnagar (Received for publication on 29 January 1945) IN the U. S. A. and other countries, cane-mo- lasses is being used for feeding cattle, particularly dairy and beef stocks. Morrison [1937], after a critical review of a large number of reports, has summarized the position as follows: When mo- lasses is added to the ration of dairy cows, their milk yield is slightly increased due more to the higher total food consumption induced by the appetizing nature of molasses than to any signi- ficant contribution of available nutrients by the added feed. Cane-molasses is also widely used for feeding beef-cattle in the sugarcane districts of Southern States of America. It has been shown that in a ration, half of the concentrate which consists of corn and other grains can be replaced by molasses. Apparently, in such re- placement, no consideration is made of the in- evitable withdrawal of a portion of the digestible protein present in the grains. It has been further observed that the total quantity of digestible nutrients in molasses is 30 per cent less than in an equivalent amount of maize, so that, in feeding value, 2 lb. of molasses should be the equivalent to 1.4 lb. of maize. In Hawaii, Henke [1933] in his study of cane- molasses as a supplement to fattening rations for swine observed that cane-molasses could replace up to 20 per cent of rolled barley in the ration for fattening pigs. A study of cane-molas- ses as feed for dairy cows by the same author [1934] showed that when properly supplemented with high protein foods, cane-molasses may safely be substituted for 25 per cent of other con- centrates. Also, there was no indication of decreased reproductive efficiency or increase in abortion. In Louisiana, Snell and Taggart [1932, 1933] in their study of blackstrap molasses as a feed for working mules observed that molasses was equivalent to corn grain and that it could be sub- stituted up to 9 lb. for corn in a ration containing ground whole corn, alfalfa hay and soybean hay. Heavy molasses feeding seemed to increase sweating and 'winding' of mules. In India, Singh and Singh [1934, 1935] have carried out feeding experiments with molasse obtained from the open-pan system of manufac turing white sugar (Khandasari molasses). In these experiments both working bullocks and dairy cows were used and the main conclusion arrived at were: (a) 2 lb. of molasses could successfully re- place 2 lb. of maize in the ration of bullocks. (b) 1 lb. molasses could replace 1 lb. of bran in the ration of dairy cows without affecting the quantity or the quality of milk, and (c) the replacement of the grain with molasses was possible only during winter
N. K. AYYAR AND A. W. ZUBERY 141 months; in summar, the feeding of molasses had a deleterious effect on the health of the animals. In a later publication these authors [Singh and Singh, 1937] have further shown that as a feed for working bullocks, the factory molasses was as good as the khandasari variety. The conclusions drawn by Singh and Singh are, however, open to serious criticism. A careful perusal of their data shows that nutrients in the control ration of the working bullocks were significantly more than those re- quired for maintenance and the type of work performed. The experimental animals, more- over, were adults and one could reasonably assume that the body-weights of these animals would not vary significantly even when they were fed at a higher level. Apparently, the change in body-weight, which took place in their experiment was of little value as an index to the influence of rations. It would have been quite possible for the animals to maintain the same trend of body weight, if 2 lb. of maize had been altogether absent from the control ration. As such, the replacement of the superfluous 2 lb. of maize by 2 lb. of molasses in the experimental ration cannot be regarded as evidence of the nutritive values of maize and molasses being equivalent. This, together, with the fact that the total diges- tible nutrients in molasses are 30 per cent lower than in an equivalent amount of maize [Morrison, 1937], affords strong arguments against the con- clusion reached by Singh and Singh. A further point to be considered in this connection is, how far one can justify, particularly under Indian conditions of feeding, the ignoring of the digestible protein in maize and bran, while advocating their replacement by molasses which does not contain any digestible protein. In this communication are reported the results of an investigation carried out to throw light on the following points. (1) Whether a molassed feed has any dele- terious effect on the health and work- ing capacity of the animals, and, (2) Whether the molassed feed is suitable for working stock. In order to secure information on the above points, experiments were carried out on three lines to study (a) the effect of the addition of bagomolasses to an inadequate village ration, (b) the effect of the addition of bagomolasses to the village ration enriched by a supplement and (c) the effect of replacement of gram husk by bagomolasses from an adequate ration for work- ing bullocks. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF BAGOMOLASSES The bagomolasses used in the experiments men- tioned above was chemically examined and the percentages dry on matter basis are given below: Crude protein . . . . . 2.64 Ether extract . . . . . 0.41 Crude fibre . . . . . 13.60 Nitrogen-free extract . . . . 67.02 Total ash . . . . . 16.33 100.00 Acid-soluble ash . . . . 11.04 CaO . . . . . 1.25 P2O5 . . . . . 0.13 A perusal of the data given above would show that the protein content of molasses feed is low and comparable to that of a dry roughage such as wheat bhusa. Unlike the dry roughages, however, the crude fibre in bagomolasses is prac- tically one-third of what is present in the former feeds. The outstanding feature in bagomolasses is the presence of a large percentage of nitrogen- free extract which is mainly composed of easily absorbable sugars. The amount of ether-ex- tract present in molasses feed is negligible. Turn- ing to mineral constituents, it may be seen that bagomolasses is rather rich in total ash nearly 68 per cent of which is acid soluble. In the acid- soluble ash constituents, there is an extraordinary preponderance of lime over phosphate, the former being ten times the latter. The chemical composition of bagomolasses as set out above indicates that this material cannot be put in any definite category of feeding-stuffs available in this country. Because of its low fibre-content, it cannot be considered as a roughage although it resembles a roughage in its poor protein content. For its rather large nitrogen-free extract content, bagomolasses can be assigned a place with gram or oats. EXPERIMENTAL Twenty-four healthy working bullocks of the Hariana and Dhani breeds were selected and divided into three groups of eight for each of the three experiments planned above. Each group was again divided into two sub-groups of four each, so that while one sub-group was receiving the control ration, the other received the experi- mental ration. In order to make the two rations strictly comparable, one animal of each group had a mate in the other of the same breed and F2
142 Bagomolasses as Cattle Feed closely approximating in age, live weight, and general condition. Furthermore, to avoid any disparity in the work performed, one animal from each group was combined to form a pair for the yoke. The animals performed medium type of work, i.e. about six hours a day. The work mostly consisted of ploughing and occasionally carting. Feeding experiments were started on 2 April 1942. Towards the beginning of May, there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease amongst the cattle at Izatnagar. The animals under this investigation were also affected and it was necessary to discontinue them from work. The scheduled rationing was, however, maintained, although in considerably restricted amounts. Towards the end of June, all the ex- perimental animals recovered from foot-and- mouth disease and the routine drawn up under the different investigations was restored immediate- ly. By the middle of September, a series of 10- day metabolism experiments was completed for the different groups of animals. The experi- ments continued up to 22 November 1942, when the investigation was stopped. During these experiments observations were recorded on the following points: (1) Food consumption. (2) Change in body weight. (3) Working capacity and general health. In the metabolism experiments observations were made on the nitrogen balance of both con- trol and experimental groups of animals in each of the three lines of investigations planned. The nitrogen-balance studies were considered necessary to supply a more exact information regarding the usefulness of bagomolasses either as an added item or a substitute in the rations for working animals. During the course of metabolism ex- periments, some of the ainmals had to be dropped out as they became indifferent to their food on account of a peculiar sensitiveness to the meta- bolism harnesses. In the metabolism studies, therefore, actually 18 animals were used six for each investigation. The introduction of bagomolasses into the diet of all the experimental groups of animals was made gradually and within a short time the animals could be easily induced to consume 4.5 lb. of it. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION I. The effect of the addition of bagomolasses to the inadequate village ration The rations for the control and experimental groups are shown below:N. K. AYYAR AND A. W. ZUBERY 143 The data show that the animals receiving experi- mental ration containing bagomolasses apparent- ly consumed more dry matter than the animals receiving control ration. However, this increased consumption was found on statistical analysis to be insignificant. Live weight. The animals on control ration were found to lose weight gradually as the time of feeding progressed. Their average weight at the start of the experiment was 785 lb. and decreased by the end of the experiment to an average of 736 lb. On the other hand the animals on experimental ration maintained a more or less constant body-weight. Their average body weight at the beginning of the experiment was 801 lb. and at the end, 809 lb. However, when the change in live weight of the two groups was statistically examined the difference between the two groups was not significant. Nitrogen-balance. The nitrogen-balance of the two groups of animals has been set out in Table II. TABLE II.

Apparently, the poor village ration could be improved by the introduction of wheat bran. It has already been mentioned that even after the enrichment of the poor viallge ration, the energy supply was 25 per cent below the normal requirement. This apparent defi- ciency was compensated by the higher quota of digestible protein supplied in the modified ration. This extra protein perhaps met the energy re- quirement for work. When bagomolasses was added to the modified village ration there was no apparent beneficial effect. The average reten- tion of nitrogen however increased from 12.6 gm. (on modified village ration) to 20.5 gm. (on modi- fied village ration + bagomolasses). In this case also the higher retention was due to the combined results of better digestion and utiliza- tion.

The effect of replacement of gram husk by bagomolasses in an adequate ration for working bullocks It has been mentioned in part I of this series [Ray and Talapatra, 1945] that bagomolasses is comparable to gram husk in nutritive value. In the present investigation, an experiment was planned to study the effect of replacement of an equivalent amount of gram husk in a theoretically adequate ration for working bullocks. The rations for the control experimental groups of animals are as follows: Control group Experimental group Gram husk . . . 4.5 lb. Nil Wheat bran . . . 3.0 lb. 3.0 lb. Maize . . . . 2.0 lb. 2.0 lb. Rape cake . . . . 2.0 lb. 2.0 lb. Ardawa . . . . 2.0 lb. 2.0 lb. Bagomolasses . . . Nil 4.5 lb. Wheat-bhusa . . . Ad lib. Ad lib. Common salt . . . 2 oz. 2 oz. Food consumption.

HEALTH AND WORKING CAPACITY OF THE ANIMALS The health of the experimental animals fed with and without bagomolasses was apparently normal. As has already been stated, all the molasses-fed animals maintained their live-weights during this short period but whether they would have done so for longer periods could only be determined by carrying out long-term experiments. A close watch was kept on the working capacity of the experimental animals and controls. The conclusion drawn from this short-period and admittedly empirical observation is that the groups of animals receiving bagomolasses exhibit- ed a working capacity which was comparable, if not superior, to that of their yoke mates not receiving bagomolasses. In spite of the animals getting a fairly large amount of salt (2 oz. a day), the urinary excretion as shown in Table VII was significantly higher in the bagomolasses groups than in the control groups. TABLE VII Total urinary excretion per animal per day 146 Incidence of Helminth Infection in India But, since the animals maintained their live weights and general condition of health, this slight diuresis seems of no consequence. SUMMARY An inadequate village ration for working bullocks can be improved by supplementing with bago- molasses without inducing any bad effect on the health. The higher retention of nitrogen in the supplemented feeding suggests that when the energy-deficient typical village ration is fortified by adequate amounts of energy-giving food like bagomolasses, the necessity for the costly protein concentrate can be considerably curtailed. In an adequate ration of working bullocks gram husk can be economically substituted with bagomolasses without any ill-effects on the animals. The health and working capacity of animals receiving bagomolasses to the extent of 18 per cent to 27 per cent dry matter in the ration com- pared well with those of the control groups during a short-term experiment.

CONTROL OF ACUTE THEILERIASIS IN CALVES IN THE PUNJAB By K. RAGHAVACHARI, Research Assistant, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, ABBAS ALI SHAH, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Multan, and H. N. RAY, Protozoologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 1 November 1944) (With Plate V) IN May 1940, we were called to attend a severe outbreak of acute theileriasis in calves of less than three months in age on a farm in the Multan district. On previous occasions the malady was recognized to have caused heavy death among calves on the farm. Locally the disease is known as kanpher ki bimari, i.e. illness with marked swel- ling of the parotid glands. It is produced by an endoglobular parasite, provisionally identified as Theileria annulata. The disease is prevalent from March to September, and the rate of mortality from 1936 to 1939 ranged between 13 and 23 per cent. Up to June 1940, the rate had reached 10 per cent. Since the chemotherapy of theileriasis has not yet been developed to a satisfactory stage, it is merely intended in this article to deal with the control measures adopted in endeavouring to eradicate the disease. A brief description of the symptoms as well as post-mortem lesions is given so that methods of diagnosis may be more widely known. SYMPTOMS The disease occurs in acute and in subacute forms. In the former, the characteristic symptoms are dullness, discharge from the eyes and nose, raised body temperature (103ºF. to 106ºF.), marked swelling of the parotid, suprascapular and pre- crural lymphatic glands (Plate V, figs. 2 and 3), frothy salivation, constipation followed by diar- rhoea, ulcerated gums (as a result of which the calves cannot suckle) and a subsequent shrouding of the teeth (Plate V, fig. 1). About the third week, most of the calves die and in the remainder symptoms become subacute. In some fatal cases, respiratory troubles, such as bronchitis and catarrh of the lungs have been observed. In the sub- acute form, the above symptoms are milder. Ailing calves continue to suckle. The body tem- perature usually remains below 104ºF. Faeces are soft and yellowish in colour. Visible mucous membranes are pale and anaemic. The eyelids and the surrounding regions are oedematous. Such cases, with proper care and nursing, are likely to recover after four weeks from the onset of the disease. It may be mentioned that gingivitis and stoma- titis are the most severe complications and render the animals unable to suckle. This results in loss of condition and progressive emaciation, leading finally to death. Another and less common complication is pneumonia. LESIONS The condition of the carcase is poor, mucous membranes are pale and in the majority of cases subcutaneous tissues, including fat, are stained deep yellow. The gums are red and ulcerated and show a light-grey gangrenous deposit. There may be pneumonia. The pericardial fat is deep- yellow and the heart muscle pale. The liver is soft and icteric, petechiated and greatly enlarged (Plate V, fig. 6). The gall bladder is usually distended and contains coagulated bile of dark- green colour. The spleen is soft and much en- larged. The urinary bladder often contains yellow coloured urine. The abomasum shows charac- teristic ulcerations (Plate V, fig. 5). It may be emphasized here that prognosis is favourable only in cases where the mouth lesions are not severe. CONTROL MEASURES Sen and Sreenivasan [1937] tried several drugs for the treatment of experimental cases of the- ileriasis in hill bulls. Of these, atebrin (Bayer) was the only one which cured as many as 55 to 57 per cent of infected cases, but they also noted that natural recovery took place to about the same extent. Since so far no drug treatment has proved satisfactory for this disease, an attempt was made to control the arthropod vector, viz. Hyalomma aegyptium, with which the farm was found to be extensively infested. It has been proved to our satisfaction by one of us (H. N. R.) that this tick is responsible for transmitting acute theileriasis to 149 G 2
150 Control of Acute Theileriasis in Calves in the Punjab young calves and that the infection is transmitted hereditarily only in the adult stage of the tick and not in the larval or nymphal stages. As found by Fotheringham and Lewis [1937], this is quite different from what has been experienced in T. parva infection. The first object was to save the new-born calves. For this purpose, they were divided into two groups, viz. weaned at birth and unweaned. For the former, an area was rendered tick-proof by first digging up the earth to a depth of about 18 in. and then burning dry leaves and grass over the dug-up area. Subsequently, a moat about 9 in. wide and 6 in. deep surrounding the area was filled with water. Attendants were engaged exclusively for this tick-proof paddock. It was observed that calves, which were detained here for three months, were susceptible to infection when removed to an infected area, though none died. For the calves of the second group, more elaborate arrangements were made. Cows in advanced pregnancy were isolated from the main herd at a place about half-a-mile away. Before removing them to this segregation camp, all ticks on the animals were hand-picked, their tails and ears clipped in, and rest of the body sprayed every third day with an arsenical solution con- sisting of soft soap 11 oz., liquid paraffin 1 lb. 2½ oz., sodium arsenite 1 lb. 1 oz. and water 50 gallons. Separate attendants and grazing pas- tures were arranged. There were also several calves which were weaned at birth, but were below two months in age. All these calves were dipped in the arsenical solution using a Cooper's portable swim-bath and housed in a paddock at some dis- tance from the main farm. Dipping was done every third day as before. A few of these calves developed the disease, but at the first appearance of symptoms they were returned to the sick ward where they were given symptomatic treatment, along with good nursing. The floor of the sick ward was covered with hay bedding about 4 to 6 in. thick, to afford comfort and at the same time to prevent them from licking the earth. Control by vaccination In 1940, one of us (H. N. R.) observed that the introduction of dead parasites rendered healthy animals immune to subsequent inoculation of virulent blood containing Koch's bodies. In the light of this observation, a vaccine was pre- pared by making a suspension in 5 per cent for- malin of lymph glands and spleen from a heavily infected case on the farm. Soon after bi calves were vaccinated subcutaneously with c.c. of this vaccine and kept in the tick-free padd for 14 days before being transferred to the t infested area. Between May 23 and June 1940, 19 calves (7 females and 12 males) were treated in this maimer. Of these, 16 were trans- ferred to the tick-infested areaS. N. SAPRE 151 Further stress the importance of tick control measures. SUMMARY Methods adopted for the control of acute the- eriasis in calves due to Theileria annulata are described. Calves less than three months of age were the most susceptible, mortality rate among such calves between 1936 and 1939 ranging from 13 to 23 per cent. The vector of the disease is tick, Hyalomma aegyptium. Control measures consisted in keeping calves weaned at birth in tick-proof paddocks for at least three months. The liberal use of tick-dip was practised both for young calves and their mothers in order to keep down the number of ticks in the farm.

Sci. 7, 16 TRANSMISSION OF PASTEURELLOSIS BY THE FLEAS (CTENOCEPHALIDES FELIS) By S. N. SAPRE, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 13 April 1944) THE general association of pasteurellosis with the seasonal flare-up of fleas has been stressed by Mehra [1943] in an article presented to the 30th session of Indian Science Congress. Sen [1925] suggested the possibility of fleas acting as mechanical transmitters of haemorrhagic sep- ticaemia because of the morphological resemblance between the organism of human plague and that of haemorrhagic septicaemia and also because fleas are active agents in the transmission of the former from rat to rat and from rat to man. Daubney, Hudson and Roberts [1934] succeeded in trans- mitting the disease experimentally from mouse to mouse with Ctenocephalus felis. Mehra [1941], while working at this Institute, found that the disease could be transmitted from rabbit to rabbit by this species of flea. The main object of the present investigation has been (1) to confirm the findings of previous workers as regards the transmission of pasteurellosis by fleas in rabbits and (2) to test the possibility of the disease being reproduced in buffaloes through the agency of these insects. PASTEURELLOSIS IN RABBITS Preliminary experiments were undertaken to determine the course of bacteriaemia following an artificial infection of rabbits with Pasteurella septica, to find the best time for liberating fleas on the infected animal, and to determine the most suitable time for inoculating the donor rabbits. While fever is usually a reliable index of bacteriæ- mia, microscopical examination of suitably stained blood smears would be a more positive proof. Kraneveld and Djaenoedin [1928], working on Pasteurella septica infection in buffaloes have shown that rabbit inoculations arc often positive when microscopical findings are negative. In order to determine the points at issue, three adult rabbits were used. After ascertaining that their temperatures were normal, they were in- oculated subcutancously with 1.0 c.c. of a 24 hour broth culture of a virulent strain of P. septica (of bovine origin) at 10-4 dilution. Blood cultures were made at various intervals after inoculation, and at the same time rectal temperatures were recorded and blood smears stained by Leish- man's method. For culture, 0.1 c.c. blood from the ear vain was taken into 9.9 c.c. of Ringer solution; from this, ten-fold serial dilutions were plated in 5 per cent serum agar. Counts were made after 24 hours at 37ºC. The results are shown in Table I. Rabbits died from 14 to 18 hours after infection. Cultural and microscopical examinations gave the following results:

Secondly, to obtain an enduring and comparatively high level of bac- tereamia in the peripheral circulation, such as would be essential for assuring infection through a transmitting agent, is difficult with buffaloes. Rabbits however are suitable animals since they can be easily housed and handled, and when they are kept in glass containers, the infected fleas can easily be collected after death of the donor. Since the housing arrangements for the donor and receptor are separate, the possibility of in- fection through infective excreta of the donor can be easily avoided. The 11 experiments carried out may be con- veniently divided into three groups. All buffaloes were under one year of age. Group I (One experiment). In this an attempt was made to transmit pasteurollosis from one buffalo calf to another. The donor, however, failed to show Pasteurella in the peripheral cir- culation till death. Neverthless when a rise in temperature (2ºF.) was observed, 400 fleas were liberated and left till death of the animal. Fleas collected from the dead animal were negative bacteriologically. The receptor failed to show definite infection although it was left in the closed room used for the experiment and which presum- ably still contained infected fleas hiding in cre- vices, debris, etc. Discharges and other contam- inated articles only were removed and no attempt was made at disinfection. This experiment cannot be considered satisfactory, since for an unknown reason, the receptor died 15 days after exposure to the fleas. A careful cultural examination of its bone-marrow gave negative results. Group II (Three experiments). Rabbits were used as donors and buffalo-calves as receptors. About 500 fleas were used in each of the three experiments. They were liberated on the donors when a rise of temperature of 2ºF. had occurred. The Pasteurella-infected fleas, after fasting for one-and-a-half to two hours, were fed on the recep- tors (one buffalo in each experiment) for one hour on a closely clipped circumscribed area of skin under a funnel and then finally liberated. Fleas collected from the receptor buffaloes on the following day were shown to contain Pasteurella. None of the three receptor buffaloes showed clinical symptoms and were liberated from the experiment a fortnight later. Group III (Seven experiments). The number of fleas used in the experiments were 808, 1,600, 1,600, 160, 2,000, 340 and 3,000 respectively. As soon as Pasteurella were observed in the donor fleas which had been fasted for about 24 hours were allowed to feed till half-an-hour after the donor's death. In six out of the seven experiments the fleas got an infective feed for a period of nearly five hours, while in the seventh it was two hours. In one case only (experiment 2, with 1,600 fleas) was transmission successful. In experiment 5 the receptor died after three days. There was slight oedema where the infected fleas had fed, but blood smears taken after death showed no bipolar organisms. Heart blood and bone marrow examined bacteriologically also yielded negative results. The spleen was slightly haemorrhagic, endocarditis was present and also slight haemorr- hagic gastritis and enteritis. INFECTIVITY OF FLEAS AFTER VARYING PERIODS OF FASTING Thirty-four lots of infected fleas, each containing about 10 individuals, were examined bacteriolo- gically after fasting for 1 hour to 120 hours. Table II shows the results.

154 Transmission of Pasteurellosis by the Fleas Out of the 34 samples examined, 15 were positive. As would be expected the proportion of fleas found infected decreases with time since the last infective meal. More samples examined within 24 or 48 hours after the infective feed were positive than later. EXCRETION OF P. boviseptica IN THE FAECES OF FLEAS Eskey and Haas [1940] determined the pre- sence or absence of infection in the fleas by in- oculating their faeces into guinea-pigs. The role of infected faeces in transmission from animal to ani- mal or from animal to man by the rubbing of faecal droplets into abrasions or wounds has been pointed out by several investigators. In the present experiments the infectivity of six faecal samples was determined by cultural examination. Three samples collected from infected fleas at the time of their second feed after 24 hours fasting were negative, while two out of three samples collected after 48 hours fasting were positive. EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER INFEC- TION CAN OCCUR BY INOCULATION OF INFECTIVE FAECES THROUGH WOUNDS ARISING FROM BITES OF HEALTHY FLEAS Sample of infected faeces was collected from about 200 fleas at the time they were used for a second feed after 24 hours fasting. The sample was found positive on cultural examination after it had been allowed to remain at room temperature for 24 hours. In the second part of the experiment about 100 healthy fleas, previously fasted, were allowed to bite healthy rabbit for one hour on a closely clipped area on its belly and a suspension of the infected faecal sample was then rubbed into the bites with a pestle. The movements of the rabbit were then restricted so that the area could not be licked. The rabbit died after 24 hours of pasteurellosis. DISCUSSION Out of the 15 experiments using a virulent Pasteurella strain in rabbits, 12 gave positive results and under these conditions evidently very few fleas were necessary for transmission. In young buffaloes, eight transmission experi- ments were negative, one was positive and two must be put as doubtful. Since the method em- ployed with buffaloes was the same as with rabbits, there appears to be no reason for the failure with buffaloes unless the vectors were incapable of in- oculating a sufficient number of organisms. If this is so the species of fleas used must be consi- dered an inefficient vector. From cultural exa- mination of infected batches of fleas which have taken an infective meal it seems likely that only a certain proportion of fleas are capable of imbibing infection. According to Eskey and Haas [1940] only 38 per cent of X. cheopis and 20 per cent of D. montanus became infected in spite of multiple infective feeds. On the other hand, Douglas and Wheeler [ 1943 ] who determined the percentage of infected fleas by cultural and histological ex- amination report that 96 per cent of these species became infected. Douglas and Wheeler, however, consider that the efficiency as a vector of a given species of flea is not solely determined by the proportion of fleas infected but is dependent on the multiplication of bacilli in the alimentary canal of the insect. It would be of some interest to ascertain the percentage of infectivity in C. felis and also whether P. septica multiplies in its alimen- tary canal. Daubney, Hudson and Roberts [1934] have shown that pasteurellosis could be experimentally transmitted in mice and rabbits. So far, the experiments recorded here corroborate their find- ings. Mehra [1943] reports a heavy mortality amongst rodents in a locality where an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia occurred and also the presence of a large number of fleas in the burrows of rats. He further showed by ex- perimental field investigations that the fleas trans- mit the disease through their bites, but if, as suggested above, the inefficiency of C. felis as a vector is established, there remains little or no doubt that the flea in question, which in- cidentally is the common flea found on cattle and young buffaloes, cannot be held responsible for outbreaks of haemorrhagic septicaemia. As an alternative vector, X. cheopis, the common rat flea, which has been proved to be efficient in human plague, suggests itself. However, even if this flea is proved to be equally efficient in the case of haemorrhagic septicaemia, it would be dif- ficult to incriminate it, since this species is not normally found on cattle. And assuming that it may occasionally attack cattle, it would then have to be ascertained whether rodents carry the organ- isms in question. It is of interest in this connec- tion to note that Neumann [1903] isolated a supposed representative of the Pasteurella group from a wild rat. Smillie [1920] also encountered
S. GANAPATHY IYER AND Z. A. HASHMI 155 pastcurella organisms in normal rats, while Meyer and Batchelder [1926] isolated 34 strains of paste- urella from wild rats during plague eradication measures along the Pacific Coast. In India, Raj- gopalan and Gopalkrishnan [1939] recorded an outbreak of pasteurellosis in white mice. There is, however, no proof that these Pasteurella strains were pathogenic to cattle. In absence of any direct evidence of this type, X. cheopis could not be accepted as a vector in haemorrhagic septicaemia. For the present, therefore, it can only be stated that C. felis appears to be an in- efficient vector and is normally incapable of trans- mitting haemarrhagic septicaemia in buffaloes. SUMMARY Experiments on transmission of P. septica from rabbit to rabbit and from rabbit to buffalo were tried using C. felis, the common dog flea. The experiments in rabbits were positive and a very small number of fleas was effective. On the other hand, in 11 experiments with buffalo- es and up to 3,000 fleas as transmitting agents eight failed completely, one was positive and two were doubtful. Since most of the experiments with buffaloes were negative in spite of optimum conditions as regards the number of fleas and high virulence of the organism, it seems unlikely that in practice Pasteurella in bovines is trans- mitted by the class of insect. Pasteurella was found in the faeces of fleas fed on infected rabbits and then fasted for 48 hours. The orga- nism was also found in the bodies of infected fleas which have been fasted for at least 72 hours.

Rec., 52, 889 THE OCCURRENCE AND SPREAD OF FOWL CHOLERA IN INDIA By S. GANAPATHY IYER and Z. A. HASHMI, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 12 January 1945) Early records of poultry mortality in India are the Jessore and Madras outbreaks (1817 and 1828) mentioned by Raymond [1911] and the Calcutta outbreak (fowl cholera) reported by the Indian Cattle Plague's Commission [1871]. Until the outbreak of Ranikhet disease in 1927 [Edwards, 1928], fowl cholera was being reported as the chief cause of fowl mortality in this country, though fowl spirochetosis was also well known. Since the diagnosis of Ranikhet disease, much less prominence has been given to outbreaks of fowl cholera. In the course of a three-year's disease survey of the greater part of this country, it was not possible to find fowl cholera infection even in a single widespread epizootic among fowls. Further, all the materials suspected for fowl cholera when tested in this section have proved negative. However, in two localities, relatively near the laboratory, limited enzootics of fowl cholera, causing insignificant mortality, were observed, and authentic strains of Past aviseptica recovered. From this survey two significant conclusions emerge: (i) that contrary to common belief, fowl cholera occurs infrequently; and (ii) that, in this country, widespread epizootics are not a feature of fowl cholera. The fact, that Past aviseptica could be isolated in outbreaks from two nearby localities, led us to scrutinize the present methods employed by field workers for diagnosing the disease and to investigate the various factors affecting the viability of the organism in the suspected material during transit. The results of our investigations suggest a pos- sibility that the disease, in its enzootic form may be somewhat more prevalent than has been indicated by our survey. EPIZOOTIOLOGY Little attention has been paid in this country to the epizootiology of this disease. Sporadic outbreaks have occasionally been recorded, many of which were probably wrongly diagnosed on the strength of naked-eye and microscopical examination of autopsied birds. Information regarding sources of infection and methods of spread of fowl cholera is scanty, although these constitute pre-requisites for eradication or control of the disease. Past aviseptica possesses low powers of resis- tance to inimical agencies158 Occurrence and Spread of Fowl Cholera in India organisms, both virulent and avirulent, from the mucous membranes of apparently healthy animals. Hughes and Pritchett [1930] could not produce the disease by the oral administration of virulent Past. aviseptica in capsules and found that the usual channel of infection was through the upper respiratory tract. Webster [1924, 1 and 2], working with rabbit pasteurellosis, found that preceding an outbreak, there was a fall in resis- tance due to adverse environment, and a cor- responding rise in the number of the organism which ultimately led to an outbreak of the disease. It would appear from the existing work that the more resistant are not affected, those less resistant become carriers, while hypersusceptible birds die of infection. EXPERIMENTAL An outbreak of fowl cholera provided the opportunity to study certain epizootiological aspects of the disease. This occurred in the Institute farm which is self-contained as no eggs, chicks or fowls are brought from outside, and every possible precaution is taken to prevent the introduction of diseases. The disease broke out in 1940 in a group of 40 cockerels causing the death of six only. The source of infection was undetermined. A further outbreak occurred in two adjoining pens in mid-summer, 1941, with sporadic cases over a period of a month. Out of a flock of 2,000 birds, only 11 died. The organisms recovered were of the 'blue colony' type [Hughes, 1930] associated with enzootic fowl cholera. The recurrence of the disease on the farm, the type of organisms re- covered, the insignificant morbidity and mortality and the course of the outbreak led us to suspect the existence of carrier fowls in the flock, such a possibility being in accord with the findings of Manninger [1921], Van Es [1937] and Shook and Bunyea [1939]. Therefore, soon after the second outbreak, it was decided to examine the flock for the presence of carriers. METHODS (1) Agglutination test. The rapid whole-blood, stained-antigen method, employed by Shook and Bunyea [1939], was tested using serum from fowls and rabbits previously immunized with Past. aviseptica. The serum had a titre of 1/320. Crystal violet-stained antigens of homologous and heterologous strains were used. The re- action was unsatisfactory and the results were not clear-cut. However, the strains of fowls cholera used by us were perhaps not quite suit- able for the test. (2) Bacteriological. Webster [1924, 1] working with rabbit pasteurellosis, and Pritchett et al [1930] working with fowl pasteurellosis, recovered the organisms from carriers by culturing the upper respiratory tracts. Preliminary tests were conducted to standardize the technique. The following methods for obtain- ing material from nasal passages of fowls were compared: (a) nasal washings obtained by syring ing the nose with saline or broth; (b) swabbing the nasal cavity with dry cotton swabs; and (c) swabbing the cavity with a wet cotton wool swab. Nasal washings invariably gave a profuse growth of contaminating bacteria. Swabs and especially wet swabs gave better results and isolated colonies of Pasteurella could easily be obtained. With regard to culture media, Webster and Baudisch [1925] showed that the growth of Pasteurella was more profuse under a reduced oxygen pressure and on media with a trace of rabbit blood or an iron compound with strongly catalytic properties. Schütze and Hassanein [1929] also got better results by adding small amounts of blood or sodium sulphite. A test was therefore run to compare routine laboratory media and certain other enriched media. The following were used: (a) nutrient agar, (b) plain broth, (c) agar with 5.0 per cent ox blood, (d) agar with 1.0 per cent ox blood (e) agar with 0.5 per cent sodium sulphite, (f) agar with haemo lyzed rabbit blood, (g) Fielde's medium, and (h) peptone broth with 10.0 per cent inactivate ox serum. Serum broth gave thicker growth than plain broth. The counts on nutrient agar were signi- ficantly lower. All the other enriched media gave uniformly good results, with little difference in counts. As to the relative value of liquid and solid media, swabs from the nasal cavity were sown as follows: (a) into a tube of broth which was incubated for 24 hours at 37ºC. and then plated, (b) into a tube of broth, which was incubated for one hour and then plated, and (c) on to a blood-agar plate. Initial incubation in the liquid medium invariably led to an over growth of contaminants. Direct sowing on blood agar gave discrete colonies from which Pasteurella colonies could be easily picked.
S. GANAPATHY IYER AND Z. A. HASHMI 159 SURVEY OF FLOCK FOR CARRIERS The first test for carriers was conducted soon after the second outbreak, which lasted from May 18 to June 13, 1941. Between August and December, cultures were made from the nasal passages of all fowls in the affected pens as well as the two adjoining pens. In all, 273 fowls were examined, 11 of which (4.06 per cent) yielded Past. aviseptica on culture. The organisms were typed and studied in detail. Morphology, etc. In morphology, staining, colony form, etc. the organisms conformed to the genus Pasteurella trevisan. The 11 strains were identical in cultural and biochemical charac- ters. All were of the 'blue-colony' type [Hughes, 1930], produced turbidity and a heavy viscid sediment in broth, thin glistening white growth on plain agar, viscid varnish drop-like growth on blood-agar and no growth on MacConkey's medium. Gelatin was not liquified, methyl-red and Voges-Proskauer reactions were negative, and no change was produced in litmus milk. Ammonia, indol and catalase were formed and nitrates were reduced. Acid was produced in dextrose, sucrose, laevulose and mannitol. Lactose, glycerol and rhamnose were not fermented. Serological. Tables I and II show the results of agglutination reactions. More than two serologi- cal groups are suggested. One strain (No. 574) could not be classified as it failed to produce agglutinins on repeated inoculations.

One c.c. of this bacterial suspension standardized to contain about 200 million bacteria per c.c. was inoculated subcutaneously. The period of observation extended over seven days. Table III shows that the strains varied consider- ably in their virulence. Persistence of carriers. Carriers were found in all four pens examined, although the disease appeared to have been confined to two pens only. Since the test, all birds dying on the farm have been autopsied and the materials cultured for fowl cholera with negative results. As no further outbreak occurred a part of the flock was tested for the persistence of carriers. Twenty-one months after the first examination, in March and April, 1943. cultures were again made from the nasal cavities of 287 birds. In this test, the birds were selected at random from different groups in order to obtain an index of infection for the whole farm. An entirely

Late Physiological Chemist, Bengal (Received for publication on 29 December 1944) IN order that the position of animal nutrition in Bengal may be properly judged, it is necessary to realize the limitations forming the special feature of this province. Bengal presents a melancholy spectacle in that its food output whether for man or beast is as much deficient in quality as in quantity. Of the total cropped area of nearly 30 million acres (net cropped area 23 million acres), only about 0.1 million acres are under fodder crops. Even of this nearly half is in one single district, viz. Mymen- singh. In other words the area in the remai- ning 26 districts is so small that its effective value is negligible. Of other Indian provinces, we find that the Punjab has five million acres for 15.8 million cattle, Bombay 2.5 million acres for 9.96 million cattle and U.P. 1.48 million acres for 32 million cattle. In contrast with these, the only practical expression Bengal has given as a mark of her cattle conscience or reverence for the cow is the meagre allotment of a nominal acreage of fodder (as stated above) and of the residues (straw) left over after the harvest of rice crop from 22 to 23 million acres, giving an estimated yield of 400 to 500 million maunds of straw. Even if the whole of it is available (it is well known it is not, as a part of it is used as matting, a part as thatching, etc. and a part is wasted) it will not be able to provide more than 2.5 to 3 seers of straw per head of adult popula- tion leaving out of account the young stocks. In the case of concentrates the position is not better. The area under rape and mustard is 0.76 million acres, til (sesame) 0.18 million acres, linseed 0.19 million acres. The area under rape and mustard has gone down considerably, as in 1911-12 it was 1.32 million acres, There was a slow decrease up to 1920-21 after which there was an abrupt shrinkage. The present area (764,000 acres) is about three-fifths of the area 30 years ago. The by-products available from these and from wheat (0.17 million acres), barley (0.12 million acres), maize (0.10 million acres), gram (0.41 million acres), and a sprinkling of jowar and bajra all taken together do not provide more than a chatak per head per day. It is not known what the exact areas are under pulses. The crop report states that the area under other food grains including pulses and marua is 1.3 to 1.4 million acres. To these may be added the variable by-products of rice manufacturers and a small supply of imported cakes as well as by-products from imported oil- seeds and pulses. It is difficult to ascertain from the crop reports the amount available after meeting exports and imports. It appears from earlier reports that about 3 to 4 million maunds of linseed were imported and about the same amount exported from Calcutta. Regarding wheat, rape, mustard and pulses, there is apparently a surplus of im- ports. Little is known about the import and export of oilcakes and grain by-products. Nevertheless some amount of cattle feed is available from these different avenues of import; but taking the province as a whole the position is that except for an insufficient supply of a coarse fodder like rice straw and a limited supply of concentrates, we have hardly anything to offer to our cattle. Our green fodders occupy such a meagre area that not more than 0.4 million of our cattle can derive nourishment from it. Yet these constitute the sources through which we have to feed not only the very large cattle population but also other animals. According to the census conducted in 1940 the number of live-stock in Bengal is as follows: Cattle . . . . . . 22,623,367 Buffaloes . . . . . . 1,076,266 Sheep and goats . . . . . . 6,545,950 Horses and ponies . . . . . . 77,398 Mules . . . . . . 175 Donkeys . . . . . . 905 Camels . . . . . . 93 Pigs . . . . . . 159,743 Fowls . . . . . . 25,931,999 Ducks . . . . . . 5,055,661 It will thus be seen that our problem is not merely 161
162 Animal Nutrition Problem in Bengal a case of deficient supply but of the barest need of subsistence. The matter is further complicated on account of the fact that the feeding of rice straw is followed by certain complexities in which almost all the essential nutrients suffer from faulty assimilation. THE GENERAL FEEDING VALUE OF RICE STRAW A short-term feeding trial conducted at Karnal (Punjab) suggested that rice straw when fed with concentrate was superior to wheat straw and was as good as jowar (sorghum). Later on when work on a more comprehensive scale was undertaken in Bengal, it was revealed that under rice straw feeding not only the assimilation of more essential nutrients like protein, lime, phosphorus and potash was generally interfered with, but in some regions, specially in saline tracts, even other minerals suffered from disturbed equilibrium. The Animal Nutrition Section, Bengal, started under the grant of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, carried out these ex- periments when the present author was in charge of it. The work was directed towards the examina- tion of the existing food sources in order that an economic formula of rationing might be devised in due regard to quality and quantity of feed. The first step towards it was to study how these foodstuffs behaved within the animal system and what were their specific characters for or against proper nutrition. The work followed broadly on two specific lines, one in reference to the direct practical problems and the other of more technical nature mainly arising as a corollary towards the solution of many such problems. This note deals with the former aspect. Protein. It was found that when the straw was fed alone, there was an uneconomic wastage of protein fraction which was least digested (re- maining largely on the negative side), but when supplemented with cake or concerntrates. the digestibility and assimilation of protein were remarkably increased. This was also the case with the bulk of organic nutrients. Phosphorus. In the case of phosphorus the actual content is initially low and even this is of doubtful availability. Lime. In the case of lime, although the amount ordinarily present is apparently more than adequate from maintenance standpoint, the level necessary for ensuring a favourable or positive equilibrium is much higher than in many other straws and green fodders. There appear to be four factors responsible for this complication, viz. (1) presence of oxalic acid and possibly other allied substances which prevent the solubility of lime, without which assimilation cannot proceed, (2) high fibre content, (3) high potash content and (4) complete absence of vitamin. Potash. As straw contains a very large per- centage of potash, a very large potash ingestion (far more than is necessary) is an inevitable accompaniment of rice straw feeding; but the puzzling factor is that, in spite of such heavy ingestion, more potash is excreted through faeces and urine than is supplied in the feed. The result is that when the data are measured on a balance sheet, a negative balance for potash is recorded. In actual fact the excess potash is drained out from body resources. There are indications that in this phenomenon the nature and quality of cake and possibly other concentrates play a significant role. Thus when the straw was fed with linseed cake, the attain- ment of a positive balance between intake and outgo was a usual feature, but when mustard cake (which is the main concentrate in these parts) was fed, there was a general tendency to a negative balance in spite of the fact that the potash ingestion was distinctly higher (in some cases 60 per cent over the other). In a recent trial the combination of til or sesame cake has also exhibited a similar feature. Soda, chlorine and magnesia. So far reference has been made to the more essential nutrients such as lime, phosphorus and potash which have recorded disturbed equilibrium under rice-straw feeding. It has since been found from more recent work that the straws specially from saline belts (and in some cases from non-saline areas also) have in addition new complexities. Thus, with Barisal straw (from saline tract) chlorine recorded negative balance in spite of feeding common salt, while in the case of another saline tract of Diamond Harbour (District 24 Parganas), magnesia, soda and chlorine all exhibited adverse equilibrium in spite of the fact that all these components were more than adequately provided. It is just possible that some of these features are endemic in respect to certain regions. Proper utilization of straw. The straw while serving as a roughage, its main function is to supply energy. Here also the most efficient utilization occurs when it is supplemented with cake. It is a fact that an unbalanced food is
INDUBHUSAN CHATTERJEE 163 not properly utilized, and since the straw is highly unbalanced, it also behaves similarly unless it is fed with more nutritious supplement. Results have shown that weight for weight the digestibility and energy efficacy of straw is liable to be reduced to half, while protein metabolism is severely upset when the straw is fed alone. On the other hand the addition of cakes and concentrates does not only arrest such a wasteful process, but operates in a highly economic way in stimulating maximum utilization of energy, protein and other nutrients. Varieties and strains of straw. According to the statistics on crop report, the rice in Bengal has been divided into three varieties, viz. amon or winter rice, aus or autumn rice and boro or spring or summer rice. In actual fact, although amon mainly belongs to transplanted variety, there are broadcasted and deep water varieties also. The trials so far conducted in Bengal were with the straw from transplanted amon, broad- casted aus and transplanted boro. Time and facilities were both limited to permit wide scale work embracing all soil and climatic belts. From the results so far obtained it appears that the energy output of all straws is more or less similar, but in many other respects each is markedly different. Thus lime requirement which is general- ly high under all kinds of rice straw feeding, is comparatively less with amon, intermediate with aus and highest with boro in which the quantity of oxalic acid is also very high. The earlier work was mainly done with straw from Dacca and Nadia, and it was tacitly assumed that the characteristic features of straw from differ- ent soil belts would probably be the same. Thus while lime, phosphorus and potash presented a picture of complex metabolism, on feeding of straws from other tracts, in the case of straws from the saline belts of Barisal and Diamond Harbour, it was found that other components such as magnesia, soda and chlorine present similar complexities. It has been further found that in the amon varieties, the amount of oxalic acid is lowest in Barisal straw, considerable in Diamond Harbour straw and heaviest in Chin- surah straw. The results suggest that (1) soil condition and the environment exercise a pro- found influence on general as well as some specific characters of the straw grown in an area, and (2) in order to get dependable results, feeding and metabolic tests should be conducted with local animals under local conditions of feeding. It should be stated that so far the work was done with mixed straws as were obtained from the different localities, but comparison will be more valid and helpful if such work is conducted with straw of pure strains grown in the different soil belts. Here it will be relevant to refer to some experiments conducted with pure strains, viz. indrasail and lattisail. The point of interest lies in the fact that although chemical analyses did not reveal any marked difference in their composition, nutritional tests definitely established the superiority of indrasail over lattisail straw. Not only does it emphasize the need of conducting work with other strains but also with strains from typically different soil belts. LIME ASSIMILATION UNDER RICE STRAW FEEDING Rice straw contains an appreciable amount of oxalic acid which has the property of keeping lime in an insoluble form. This substance, which in a soluble form is also a poison, has been also found to vary according to soil and climate as reflected in a high percentage in Chinsura straw and lowest in Barisal straw. In the case of boro variety of rice straw as well as in amon variety of Chinsurah straw oxalic acid is found in such a large quantity that it is theoretically capable of rendering insoluble not only the entire lime present in the straw but it is also potentially able to render infructuous the efficacy of lime from other food sources. A striking feature however is that a large part of soluble oxalate in the straw seems to undergo decomposition in the rumen of cattle. By this, the directly harmful effect of this substance is minimized but the possibility of some direct absorption also exists with its harmful effect. Apart from this the presence of other (still unidentified) interfer- ing substances against lime assimilation has also been detected. A large amount of potash as found in rice straw is another factor causing disturbance in lime metabolism. Both potassium and oxalic acid have loomed large in the recent investigations with rice straw feeding. As a matter of fact their effect on metabolism is not merely of theoretical interest, but has a far-reaching practical significance. Evidences suggest that where oxalic acid is present in large quantities, the potash content too is high. The soluble oxalates exist chiefly as potassium oxalate. In the rumen of cattle the oxalate undergoes decomposition with the produc- tion of carbonates and bicarbonates with which I
164 Animal Nutrition Problem in Bengal potash forms new compounds and exercises such influence on the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid that the urine of rice straw feeders is invariably alkaline. This also indirectly reacts on the lime assimilation as alkaline reaction is unfavourable to the maintenance of optimum solubility of lime, without which its assimilation is retarded. A further complication lies in the fact that although a very heavy potash ingestion follows rice straw feeding, more potash is ex- creted through faeces and urine than is provided in the feed. This phenomenon seems to be related also with the kind and quality of cake, as in the investigations conducted linseed cake had a beneficient effect, but mustard cake had not. At present there is not sufficient information explaining the excess drain of potash from the body. PRE-TREATMENT OF RICE STRAW In order that the removal of these substances could be efficiently carried out several methods have been tried. The straw was subjected to the treatment of lime, caustic soda and simply water, by keeping it soaked in the respective liquids for about 24 hours. After this period the straw was washed and fed to animals. The results suggest that while caustic soda treat- ment is most efficient, its cost is a serious factor against its adoption. Lime treatment involves much less cost, but water treatment has the merit of simplicity, is least costly and is able to remove 90 per cent of potash. Moreover, the loss of organic matter which is appreciable under caustic soda treatment is the least under water treatment. Yet by this simple procedure, the feeding quality of straw is improved to such an extent that protein and minerals are better assimilated and even the otherwise high lime requirement under rice straw feeding is appreci- ably reduced. FEEDING OF CONCENTRATES WITH RICE STRAW As mustard cake forms a very important source of concentrates in Bengal, various trials were conducted with this feed in combination with rice straw. The results have been generally satisfactory with protein and many other com- ponents. But, as already stated, the excess drainage of potash under its combination is an unsatisfactory feature for which the cause still remains to be ascertained. Meanwhile tentative remedies lie in giving a better combination in which the feed should be supplemented with a number of concentrates such as linseed or/and other cakes, pulse by-products, green forages, etc. This will ensure the supply of essential pro- teins as absence of these ingredients from the diet is likely to bring about a corresponding breakdown of body proteins, and as cell tissues (which are composed of proteins) also contain potash, an excess drainage of the latter will be avoided by feeding rice straw with other con- centrates than mustard cake. RICE-KURA AND RICE BY-PRODUCT The rice by-product of good quality is half as rich in proteins as cakes; it contains a large quantity of high quality oil and is exception- ally rich in phosphorus, but a considerable part of this phosphorus is in a complex combina- tion chemically known as phytin which is not generally assimilable. A collection of sample from different sources was made and analysed. It was found that the product consisted of a variable mixture ranging from pure husk to diverse grades of intermediate products. This is mainly due to the various processes used in the production of rice and rice by-products. In the manufacture of rice whether by country process or mills, the nutrients are ultimately distributed between rice, broken rice and husks. Since rice and broken rice go for human consump- tion, the ingredients necessary for cattle food have to be derived from the residual nutrients left in the husk. The husk produced by the country process and smaller mills are obtained in a mixed condition and form approximately 25 per cent of parboiled paddy of which little more than one-third, i.e. 9 per cent are capable of being separated as finer material. The husks from Marshalls machine are broadly obtained at two stages, viz. ara and chanta. The ara husk is too coarse and contains a very large proportion of fibre and silica, whereas the chanta husk is finer and forms 21.25 per cent of parboiled paddy. By careful fractionation about half of it can be separated into more suitable cattle food. The main point to be noted in reference to the distribution of nutrients is that the bulk of protein and starchy parts go to rice, while oil (ether extract), soluble ash, phosphorus, potash and magnesia go to rice by-products. Both rice and rice by-products are particularly
S. GANAPATHY IYER 165 poor in lime, but finished rice is poorer still having one-fourth of the percentage in kura. Of the total phosphorus in rice and its by-products as much as 51 to 94 per cent consist of phytin. Several processes for stimulating its better utiliza- tion were tried but the work could not be pursued further due to the retirement of the author from service. Work on this highly important and interesting problem deserves further attention. SUMMARY The limitations forming the special feature of Bengal with regard to the problems of animal nutrition have been discussed. The general feeding value of rice straw has been dealt with. Since the straw is highly unbalanced, it is not properly utilized unless it is fed with more nutritious supplement. The soil condition and environment exercise a profound influence on general as well as specific characters of the straw in an area. In order to get dependable results, feeding and metabolic tests should be conducted with local animals under local conditions of feeding. Rice straw contains an appreciable amount of oxalic acid which has the property of keeping lime in an insoluble form. This substance has been found to vary according to soil and climate. A large amount of potash as found in rice straw is another factor causing disturbance in lime metabolism. In order that removal of these substances could be efficiently carried out several methods have been suggested. Mustard cake in combination with rice straw gave satisfactory results as regards protien and many other components. But the excess drainage of potash under its combination is an unsatis- factory feature. An excess drainage of potash will be avoided by feeding rice straw with other concentrates than mustard cake. Preliminary work on the utilizability of rice- kura and rice by-products as cattle feed was also undertaken. THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF DUCKS TO NEWCASTLE (RANIKHET) DISEASE By S. GANAPATHY IYER, Research Officer (Pathology), Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 28 November 1944) NEWCASTLE (or Ranikhet) disease has been reported in a variety of birds, both domesticated and wild, but is most common in fowls. Workers in India and other countries have reported that ducks are susceptible to the virus [Doyle, 1927; Farinas, 1930; Cooper, 1931 and Picard, 1934]. Cooper, however, stated that 'although occasion- ally ducks became affected by artificial inocula- tion and the virus could be recovered from them, those birds were found to be relatively highly resistant'. Dobson [1939] is apparently the only worker to have reported that ducks are resistant to both experimental and natural infec- tion. The writer has frequently heard from breeders and disease investigation officers in this country that ducks in infected localities have remained free from the disease. In view, therefore, of the diversity of opinion regarding the susceptibility of ducks to the Newcastle virus, the writer*, decided to inaugurate a series of experiments. * This work was carried out at the Ministry of Agriculture, Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, England, under a scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi. EXPERIMENTAL Mature Pennine ducks and ducklings were used. Fowl-passaged Newcastle virus, prepared by suspending in 1.0 per cent saline a mixture of infected liver and spleen in equal quantities, was used for subcutaneous inoculation. One c.c. of this suspension contained one million M.L.D. The experimental birds were kept individually in coops during the entire period of observation. RESULTS. Experiment I (Table I) Transmission experiments. (1) On 10 November 1939, two ducks were injected each with 1 c.c. virus. As no reaction occurred, they were injected 26 days later with 10 c.c. virus. They remained healthy. To complete the observation, they were bled for serum and killed 40 days after the first injection. (2) On 17 November 1939, two ducks were exposed to infection by placing them in a contaminated coop. They remained healthy though fowls had previously died of the infection K
166 Susceptibility of Ducks to Newcastle in the coop, and, on the 19th day, the infection was implemented by injecting them each with 10 c.c. virus. As they showed no reaction they were bled and killed 33 days after the first injection. (3) Two more ducks were injected with 10 c.c. virus on 21 November 1939. One of these died as a result of helminthic infection on the 14th day, while the other showed no reaction and was reinjected with 10 c.c. virus on the 15th day. It remained well and was bled and killed on the 29th day after the first inoculation. (4) Two eight weeks-old ducklings were injected each with 1 c.c. virus. They showed no reaction; on the fifth day one was killed and an emulsion of its liver and spleen was subinoculated into a fowl to test the infectivity of the tissues. The fowl remained healthy and was later shown to be susceptible to Newcastle virus infection. The tissues from the duckling, therefore, contained no virus capable of infecting the fowls. The second duckling also showed no reaction to the inoculation and was killed on the 20th day. The autopsy of this bird revealed nothing unusual.

Experiment II (Table II) Serum-virus neutralization. Serum samples, col- lected from ducks that had been treated with the virus were pooled and examined for the presence of neutralizing antibodies by the in vitro method. Tubes were put up containing serum and virus and, after two hours contact at room temperature (18ºC.), or after 18 hours contact at 37ºC., were inoculated into susceptible fowls and fertile 11 day-incubated hen eggs (only fowl inoculation has been shown in Table II). Suitable control tubes were also prepared using the serum of ducks that had not been inoculated with the virus. In no case was the virus neutralized, since the test fowls and chick embryos died of the infection.

ABSTRACTS Female aspects of relative fertility in sheep. R. B. KELLY (1939). Aust. vet. J. 15, 184 KNOWLEDGE concerning the fundamental principles of the physiology of reproduction owes much to the painstaking observations of laboratory animals such as rabbits and guinea- pigs, but relatively recently a few attempts have been made to obtain that information concerning the larger farm ani- mals. It has been inferred commonly that what has been observed in small animals also occurs in other species. The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland activates the gonads alike in birds and man and therefore in broad principles the above inference is justified. Although in the rabbit ovulation is induced by coitus and even by mechanical irritation of a like nature it would be quite incorrect to infer that this is so for the ewe in which ovulation is quite independent of such a stimulus. In the ewe oestrus is the first phase of the reproductive function. Oestrus by itself is not a sign of fertility though it is a necessary preliminary to conception. There is little interbreed variation in the duration of dioes- trus in domestic ewes. The normal period is 17 days. A range 16-18 is common, however 15 or 19 days interval must also be regarded as normal. The so-called 'silent heat' occurs most frequently in Merino ewes. In these cases oestrus usually reappears after a period which is a multiple of the normal. During silent heat no odoriferous substances attractive to the ram are produced. Recurrent intervals of sexual excitement alternating with a period of dioestrus constitute a breeding season. The long break between these seasons is known as the period of anoestrus or sexual inactivity. According to Marshall, sexual periodicity is primarily a function of the gonads. In England most breeds of sheep have an extended breeding season during late summer, autumn and winter. In Scotland it is later. While the breeding season is more limited in countries further north than Scotland, a continual activity is approached within the tropics. Marshall also observed that Dorset Horned and Merino breeds of sheep are peculiar in that they come on heat throughout the year. The author's observations on three groups of Merino ewes and a group of Border Leicester x Merino cross-bred ewes showed a well-defined periodicity in the percentage of ewes coming into oestrus. In these four groups there was a decrease in the incidence of oestrus during the spring followed by an increase in the summer months and higher levels maintained during late summer, autumn and winter. The importance of periodicity in sexual activity cannot be over-estimated in Australia where the statements of Mar- shall and others are accepted, since, if there is a definite pe- riodicity as observed above then brief paddock matings will give unsatisfactory results. Again genetic factors play an important part in the periodicity. Some wild types and domestic breeds of sheep (the Scottish Blackface) are either monoestrus or nearly so; and others (Merinos) approximate a completely polyoestrus condition. The long wool breeds have a marked autumnal periodicity in sexual activity and this is accepted as due to hereditary make up. It is further suggested that the observed periodicity of sexual activity within the Australian Merinos is the result of out- crossing with long wool sheep during the foundation of the breed. Marshall attributes the reproductive rhythm to three things (1) Metabolical (2) general environment and (3) exter- oceptive stimuli. The observations of the author do not support the first two points of Marshall and other workers. It has been observed that light has a marked, if indirect, effect upon the gonads and that the essential stimulation is of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. The effect of daylight on sexual activity is discussed and according to the obser- vations of the author, increased sexual activity in ewes was observed during decreasing hours of daylight. The funda- mental phenomenon of reproduction is discussed showing its complexity and indicating that reduced fertility results from a number of causes. Fertility is defined as the ability of a male or female to beget or bear progeny. Fertility may be high or low and it is determined by the number of off-springs they produce during their breeding life. (The breeding life of a Merino ewe is divisible into three periods, youth, maturity and old age. The age factor on fertility indicates a range of 40 per cent between youth and early maturity (three years) and this is maintained up to the age of eight and then the level falls.) Normally fertile Merino ewes can ex- perience 95 parturitions per centum of ewes adequately mated. Twinning is more characteristic of British breeds than of Merinos. British breeds have borne at least 70 per cent twins while for Merinos of all ages it was only 8 per cent. The breeding records of 89 ewes, each born in a twin pair, showed that only 20 of these bore twins and 69 did not. Some workers are of opinion that twinning is capable of being inherited as a recessive unit character. On the other hand the ex- perience of the author and few others shows that the incidence of twinning is highest when the ewes are either naturally or artificially 'flushed' prior to or during mating and also that the age of the ewe is important. The ages when most twinning occurs were from 7-10 years and during this period the incidence was 33 per cent higher than the general average. Factors affecting low lamb markings and the methods to be adopted to prevent these are also discussed. [M. K. S.] Sulphanilamide in animals: dosage and tolerence. A. W. STABLEFORTH and S. L. HIGNET (1942). Vet. Rec. 54, 525 HORSES, cows and dogs were given varying doses of sul- phanilamide either single or repeated via the subcutaneous or oral routes and estimations of the concentrations in blood and milk were made at varying intervals. Detailed obser- vations of symptoms and any toxic effects exhibited by experimental animals were recorded. Single doses given varied from 1 gm. per 5 lb. body weight to 1 gm. per 20 lb. weight, while in others continued dosage was maintained to give a concentration of about 10 milligrams per cent in blood and milk respectively. In cows serious toxic symptoms developed if the drug administration was continued over seven days. The most common symptoms of sulphanilamide overdosing in animals were lack of muscle coordination, anorexia and sleepiness. The drop in milk yield reached a miximum of 40 per cent in cows receiving an initial dose of 1 gm. per 5 lb. weight and maintenance doses totalling 1 gm. per 10 lb. daily for five to seven days. From the results of many experiments carried out it was concluded that for therapeutic purposes it is desirable to maintain a concentration of about 10 mg. per cent. On this basis the doses recommended for different animals are,
168 ABSTRACTS dogs, 1 gm. per 15 lb. body-weight with the maintenance dose the same daily ; for horses, 1 gm. per 10 lb. weight with maintenance dose from 1 gm. per 20 lb. to 1 gm. per 10 lb. wieght ; and for cows, 1 gm. per 10 lb. weight with main- tenance dose the same. Some additional experiments were made on other species from which it is concluded that sheep may be treated like cows and pigs like horses. [J. A. I.] The influence of dietary factors on egg-shell quality. I. Phosphorus, II. Calcium. R. J. EVANS, J. S. CARVER and A. W. BRANT (1944). Poult. Sci. 23, 9 and 36 I. ALTHOUGH a considerable amount of work has been published on the mineral metabolism of laying hens, there is little agreement in the literature regarding the phos- phorus requirements. The authors have studied the phos- phorus requirements of laying hens and determined the in- fluence of different levels of phosphorus on egg-shell quality. Single comb White Leghorn pullets, kept in laying cages, were fed 11 different diets containing 1.5, 2.5 and 3.0 per cent calcium. The phosphorus levels of these diets were 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2 per cent and the vitamin D content was 60 A.O. A.C. chick units per 100 gm. of diet. Birds receiving 0.8 per cent of phosphorus in the diet gave better results on the whole than those fed any other levels at a 2.5 per cent level of calcium during the first four months of the experiment. No significant differences in production, egg-shell weight, egg- shell thickness or shell smoothness were observed between 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 per cent phosphorus used at 2.5 or 3.0 per- cent level of calcium during the last six months. II. The general procedure followed was the same as that used to determine the effect of the dietary phosphorus level on egg-shell quality. Calcium levels of 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 per cent, and phosphorus levels of 0.6, 0.8 or 1.0 per cent were used. Hens receiving 3.0 per cent calcium in the diet gave more satisfactory results than those receiving higher or lower levels when egg-shell thickness was used as the cri- terion. Production and egg-shell quality were considerably decreased when the dietary calcium level was reduced to 1.0 per cent. A level of 2.5 per cent calcium gave as good pro- duction as one of 3.0 per cent but the latter level of calcium was found necessary for the production of thicker egg- shells. [S. B.] Enzootic bovine haematuria (red water of cattle) in British Columbia. J. C. BANKIER (1944). Canad. J. comp. Med. vet. Sci. 101, 146 and 178 THE disease is prevalent in regions widely separated and proximity has no relation to prevalence. The majority of 'red water' farms consisted of land partially cleared of timber, and deficient in pasturage. The soil was coarse, sandy and deficient in organic matter. The disease was found to be associated with certain farms rather than the type of soil. Manuring the land for years with lime and superphosphate did not prevent the disease, nor did the addi- tion of mineral supplements to the diet. On a few farms top-dressing of the soil with gypsum together with crop ro- tation is said to have controlled the disease. Plant surveys failed to incriminate any particular regional flora incidental to the disease. Great variation was observed in the incidence in different herds maintained under identical conditions. The introduction of sick animals into clean areas neither resulted in spread of the disease nor retarded the clinical course. The disease is characterized by the presence of a haema- turia intermittent in the early stage and of short duration. The quantity of blood increased after each successive attack and coagulated blood voided. Sometimes blood clots caused retention of urine and death from uraemia. No systemic disturbance was noticed unless the loss of blood was heavy. Age, breed, sex and heredity had no bearing on the incidence of the disease: animals from 18 months to 13 years were equally affected. The lesions were confined to the inner surface of the urinary bladder, and varied from petechiation to small pedunculated vascular growths extending to the lumen of the bladder or to excessive granulations resembling papilloma. The vertex of the bladder was rarely involved, The coagulation time of the blood and the pH and sp. gr. of the urine were normal. The findings of Datta were not confirmed. Feeding experiments conducted on haematuria farms failed to incriminate water supply, pasture and feeds as causal factors, but when the animals were supplied with feeds from non-redwater areas the onset and the progress of the disease were considerably delayed. However, the feeding trials as well as field observations indicated that the disease was in some way associated with the soil content of red-water farms. No essential difference was noticed in the output of urinary inorganic sulphate in animals supplied with feeds from red-water and non-redwater farms. These results fail to confirm the Australian findings. Chemical analysis of soils from red-water and non-redwater areas gave no significant results as regards the content of Mn, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Co and Se. No essential difference was noticed in Na, K, Ca, Fe, Si, P, Mg. Zn, Pb, B and Sr contents of the sera of healthy and sick animals. Experiments indicated that top-dressing of the soil with gypsum at 300 lb. per acre and feeding of small quantity of this salt as mineral supple- ment were beneficial to some extent as control measures. The results were, however, not conclusive. [N. S. S.] The role of practising veterinarian in the control of coccidiosis. A. B. WICKWARE (1942). Canad. J. comp. Med. 6, 352 THE author in this article, having fully realized the impor- tance of poultry husbandry to meet the exigencies of war, has indicated the part that can be played by the practising veterinarian in checking the sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases of poultry. It contains much useful information of immense value to both poultrymen and veterinarians. Briefly, differential diagnostic features of infections with six different species of Eimeria are as follows : E. tenella infectionABSTRACTS 169 this period. At the end of the confinement period the flock should be placed on a new range with an access to liberal quantity of fresh green feed. Recovered adult fowls become reservoir of infection for the young birds. Cross-infection from wild birds to chick does not occur. The process of immunization against coccidiosis by exposing the birds to a moderate amount of infection in early life has much to commend it to the experienced poultrymen, but to the average breeder the measure of separate brooding and rearing is the only safeguard. In case of annual recurrence of the disease it is advisable to market the adult birds in the spring and purchase new eggs or chicks from incubator ins- tead. [H. N. R.] Studies on the survival of Johne's bacilli. R. LOVELL, M. LEVI, and J. FRANCIS (1944). J. comp. Path. 54, 120-9 JOHNE'S bacilli are believed to survive for prolonged periods outside the animal body, but this opinion is based largely on the similarity of the organism to the tubercle bacillus and not on any direct experimental evidence. The authors carri- ed out a series of experiments designed to test the viability of Johne's bacillus under a variety of conditions. These experiments may be considered under three headings : (A) SURVIVAL OF JOHNE'S BACILLI IN STERILIZED WATER AT ROOM TEMPERATURE The viability of Johne's bacilli was tested in sterilized dis- tilled water, tap water and pond water containing dried mud. Cultures of Johne's bacilli were mixed in varying amounts with each kind of water and the mixtures stored in bottles in a cupboard at room temperature. At approximately monthly intervals, 10 c.c. samples were withdrawn from each bottle, centrifuged and the deposit sown on Dunkin's medium without dye. Duplicate cultures were made after treating the deposit from an equal quantity with 10 c.c. of 10 per cent antiformin for 15 minutes. Johne's bacilli were recovered from each of the three waters after nine months, but not. after 13 months. The pH of the waters varied during the course of the experiment between 6.4 and 6.8 for the distilled water, 7.1 and 8.0 for the tap water and 5.3 and 5.9 for the pond water. The temperature fluctuated between 49º and 79º F. (B) SURVIVAL OF JOHNE'S BACILLI IN NATURALLY INFECTED INTESTINAL SCRAPINGS IN UNSTERILIZED RIVER WATER IN THE OPEN AIR Intestinal scrapings from an infected case of disease were finely emulsified and mixed with river water collected from a flooded meadow. The mixture was stored in a bottle in the shade in a suitable part of the building, and samples were withdrawn at monthly intervals and cultured after treatment with antiformin. Johne's bacilli were recovered from the water after 113 days' exposure. During the early part of this experiment, the weather was very severe and between the first and the 30th day the water was actually frozen. In a subsidiary experiment, in which a culture of Johne's bacilli was substituted for the intestinal scrapings, the bacilli were recovered only after the 1st day but not after the 30th day. The authors are unable to give any explanation of this anomalous result. In another experiment, river water to which had been added an emulsion of infected intestinal scrapings was placed in two shallow earthenware bowls, 24 in. x 4 in. one of which was kept in the shade and the other exposed to sunshine. Johne's bacilli were recovered from the bowl kept in the shade after 135 days but not after 163 days. From the bowl kept in the sunny area, bacilli were isolated after 163 days and not after 218 days. During the period of the ex- periment, the atmospheric temperatures varied between 20º and 64º F. and during the very cold weather the contents of the bowl kept in the open were often frozen ; they were never dry and the actual amount of the mixture varied with rainfall. (C) SURVIVAL OF JOHNE'S BACILLI IN NATURALLY INFECTED FAECES EXPOSED TO ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS Fluid faeces were collected from a natural case of disease and placed in a shallow porous bowl similar in size to those already described. This was placed in the open air exposed to the full effect of sunshine and rain. The contents of the bowl were sometimes fluid, sometimes frozen and at times dried by the sun. The temperature varied between 26º and 74º F. Johne's bacilli were recovered for periods up to 246 days. In another experiment, infected faeces were exposed to air, a portion in a porous bowl and some in an enamel bowl. The temperature fluctuated between 27º and 74º F. and the contents of the porous bowl became dry towards the latter part of the experiment. The contents of the enamel bowl were, however, prevented from drying by the addition of fresh water on one occasion. Under these conditions Johne's bacilli were found to be viable in the porous bowl after 152 days and in the enamel bowl after 208 days. A number of subsidiary experiments carried out with fresh samples of faeces yielded results more or less similar to those above described. In all the experiments, there was a progressive diminution in the number of bacilli with the result that the number of colonies obtained in culture towards the end was always less than that at the beginning. The viability of Johne's bacilli depends upon a number of factors, such as the intensity of infection, temperature, mois- ture content of the material, etc. ; of these the moisture con- tent appears to be the most important. Summing up their results, the authors conclude that they afford ample confirmation of the generally held view regard- ing the longevity of Johne's bacillus and lend strong support to the measures often advocated for the control of the disease, such as the breaking up of dung and manure, leaving in- fected pastures ungrazed for over a year or more, draining or fencing of ponds, etc. [It may be pointed out that these results were obtained in England under the conditions obtaining in that country and they should not be interpreted too rigidly in their appli- cation to this country where the climatic conditions are different]. [L. S.] Yeast as a protein supplement for pigs and its relation to the appearance of rickets. R. BRAUDE, S. K. KON and E. G. WHITE (1943). J. comp. Path. 53, 161 THE authors in this article record the results of feeding experiments with yeast as a protein supplement for fattening pigs in peace-time. From a practical stand-point, the results support the conclusions of many workers regarding the high value of yeast as a protein supplement for pigs, but as in the present experiments where the object was to ascer- tain whether yeast could wholly replace the protein supple- ment, some difficulties resulting from feeding large quan- tities of yeast were observed. Three series of experiments have been conducted and in these the effects of yeast at the levels of 8 and 20 per cent in the diet have been observed. A diet containing 8 per cent of yeast, with no mineral supplements to make up a balanced ration, was found to produce adverse symptoms in some of the experimental animals, whereas an addition of extra cal- cium supplement in the form of calcium carbonate (Ca con-
170 ABSTRACTS tent 38.5 per cent) prevented their appearance. A 20 per cent yeast diet even when supplemented with limestone or calcium carbonate to the extent of 1.8 to 2.5 per cent was found to be harmful, whereas the addition of cod-liver oil (declining from 1 per cent to 0.3 per cent) prevented the occurrence of symptoms. The main symptoms in the experimental animals were inappetance, abnormality in gait, appearance of tetanic spasms and the suppression of urination and defaecation. The nature of the trouble was considered to be rickets on the basis of post-mortem findings, and these comprised a puckering of the articular cartilages of the limb bones (which could explain abnormal gait), marked thickening of the periar- ticular connective tissue and abnormal width of the epiphy- seal cartilages. Histologically, there were fibrosis of the metaphyseal marrow and some rarefaction of the shaft of the bone. Throughout the sections, there was observed an excess of osteoid tissue, both as pure osteoid trabeculae and as wide margins to the bony trabeculae. Pronounced osteoporosis was also in evidence. The paper contains an excellent review of literature deal- ing with rickets in pigs in general, and in relation to yeast feeding, a passing reference has been made to ill effects arising from its use in pigs. In discussing the possible role of yeast in bringing about the condition, the authors have laid special emphasis on the high P content of this supplement which results in a marked shift in the ratio of calcium to available phosphorus. [P.G. P.] Storage changes in spray-dried whole egg powder. L. S. STUART, H. H. HALL and EDNA E. DICKS (1942). U. S. Egg and Paul. Mag. 48, 629 BACTERIAL and chemical analyses were made of samples of spray-dried whole egg powder immediately upon receipt from the driers. They were then stored at 30ºC. at relative humi- dities varying from 20 to 100 per cent for a period of 60 days, the analyses repeated, and the changes undergone during storage studied. The results of these experiments indicated that spray- dried whole egg powder which had been properly dried would not mould if stored at relative humidities of 85 per cent or less at 30ºC. or below, as well as that bacterial growth would not occur in stored samples of similar material unless the relative humidity of the storage atmosphere exceeded 90 per cent at 30ºC. Changes in the solubility of the egg powder during storage were found to be much more pronounced when the moisture content of the powder exceeded 5.0 per cent. Bacteria of the coliform group, if present, tended to remain viable during storage. Changes in the total bacte- rial count, as measured by the dilution plate method, were influenced by the amount of moisture initially present in the sample. When the moisture concentration was 5 per cent or less bacterial death appeared to be greater as the moisture content was reduced. With moisture concentrations greater than 5.0 per cent, the reverse seemed to be true. i.e. until it became high enough to allow of bacterial growth. Death of bacteria in powdered dried egg at moisture concentrations higher than 5.0 per cent seemed to be associated with the chemical changes involved in the loss of solubility. It was observed that marked decreases in the solubility of the stored material might occur independently of the changes in the free fat acid content, formol nitrogen value or total free car- boxyl groups. That pronounced increases in the content of these latter chemical constituents might be brought about as a result of bacterial or mould growth during storage at high relative humidities was also noticed. Changes in the pH values of stored dried eggs became more pronounced as the moisture content of the samples increased from 1.94 per cent to 9.96 per cent. The fact that solubility changes, decreases in the total bacterial plate count and decreases in pH values were influenced by the moisture content of the stored spray-dried whole egg powder indicated that the most important single factor in the preservation of good quality during storage may be control of the moisture content of the product. This would then involve the initial pro. duction of dried egg powder containing not more than 5 per cent moisture and adequate care in the subsequent storage and handling processes to prevent moisture absorption. The above experiments are only of a preliminary nature, and the conclusions are consequently only tentative. There is, however, urgent need for more specific information on such practical points as the most favourable relative humidity for storage as well as the actual nature of the chemical changes taking place in stored dried whole egg. [T. S. K.] Rotenone in low concentration as a tickicide and insecticide for house pets. ZACARIAS DE JESUS and ROFINO B. GAPUZ (1940). Philipp. J. Anim, Industr. 7, 391 IN view of very close association of the dog and the cat as house pets with the members of the household, tick- icides and insecticides for these animals should be neither toxic nor repulsive. They should not be in the form of emulsions as they will soil the clothes and furniture. A mixture of rotenone and cassava starch in concentration of one and two per cent rotenone was found effective as a tick- icide for dogs. Twenty to 50 grams of the preparation were necessary to treat one dog. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor sp. were killed in from 24 to 72 hours and these ticks remained attached to the skin of the host until they died and dried up. The mixture has been reported by the authors to have great insecticidal values against cat and dog fleas. The fleas die soon after the application, When applied liberally all over the body, head and appen- dages of the infested dogs and cats, one application was found sufficient to effect complete destruction of the ticks and fleas. In the case of gravid ticks, it was found necessary to repeat the treatment the following day or on the third day due to the high resistance of the ticks to the tickicide at this stage. Trials made on guinea-pigs had shown that the mixture was also effective against lice, killing them in a short time. To prevent the rotenone from deteriorating, the mixture should be kept in a well-stoppered bottle and should not be exposed to direct sunlight. [B. C. B.] Feeding urea to dairy cows. J. G. ARCHIBLAD (1943). Massachusetts Experiment Station Bulletin 406, 16 IN three years' trials with dairy cows with double reversal and continuous rations, it was found possible to replace as much as 42 per cent of the total N in the grain and 25 per cent of the total N in the entire ration by urea. In making the substitutions, urea replaced standard protein concen- trates such as cottonseed meal, soybean meal and corn gluten feed. Urea gave some favourable results, but it was not quite on a par with the standard protein concentrates for maintenance of milk production. Some factors influencing reproductive efficiency of range cattle under artificial and natural breed- ing conditions. J. F. LASLEY and R. BOGART (1943). Missouri Station Research Bulletin 376, 56 ARTIFICIAL insemination proved a practical and efficient method for breeding nearly 2,000 range cows over a period of three years. Of the cows inseminated one or more times, 78.8 per cent produced calves and required an average 0
ABSTRACTS 171 1.63 inseminations per calf. Study of the concentration, volume and motility of the semen from 12 range bulls showed much variability, but in general, fertility was related to semen volume, concentration of sperm, number of sperm per ejaculate, percentage of live sperm and percentage of sperm resistant to ten minutes' exposure to 0ºC. in egg yolk-buffer. Through the use of stored semen and dilution, the number of cows bred with a single ejaculate was greatly increased. Uterine insemination gave the best results with about 200 cows, as contrasted with groups of 20 cows each inseminated by the cervical and vaginal methods. Fertility below the average was obtained when less than 800,000,000 total sperm, or 275,000,000 live sperm or 175,000,000 sperm resistant to cold were employed for fertilization purposes. The use of dried whey and blood meal in the raising of calves on limited amounts of milk. I. L. HATHAWAY, G. W. TRIMBERGER and H. P. DAVIS (1943). Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bulletin 132, 19 DRIED whey and blood meal were successfully utilized to replace various portions of skim milk in calf rations from three weeks to six months of age. The study was based on the weekly weights and measurements of six lots of seven to nine calves each with variance analyses of the results. These were fed 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 lb. (23, 45, 68, 91, 113, or 136 kg.) of skim milk in the different lots, with replacements of 50 lb. (23 kg.) of skim milk by 6.8 lb. (3.1 kg ) of a mixture of dried whey and blood meal 3.2 parts to 1. Other feeds included in the ration were alfalfa hay, a grain mixture and a vitamin concentrate. The calves in five of the lots made average daily gains of 1.5 lb. (680 m). The supplement fed at the rate of 6.8 lb. (3.1 kg.) proved a satisfactory substitute for 50 lb. (23 kg.) of skim milk in feeding healthy dairy calves approximately three weeks of age and weighing not less than 104 lb. (47 kg.). These con- clusions were based on variance analyses of the weights obtained. The feeding value of clover-molasses silage for milking cows. A. D. PRATT and C. W. HOLDWAY (1943). Virginia Experiment Station Bulletin 353, 15 MOLASSES at the rate of 2 and 44 per cent added to clover silage in the ensilage cutter produced a silage equal or superior, on a dry-matter basis for milk production, to clover hay. The studies were conducted in three experi- ments with three cows each fed by the reversal method, with clover silage and clover hay or clover silage alone as the sole roughage with a grain ration. Corn silage was fed for one year. MGIPCORIGINAL ARTICLES BACTERIOLOGY OF BOVINE MASTITIS IN INDIA WITH SPECIAL REFER- ENCE TO THE INCIDENCE OF STREPTOCOCCUS AGALACTIAE By RAM NARAIN MOHAN, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 26 April 1945) VETERINARY clinicians in India have been quite familiar with mastitis as an affection of milch cattle, but it was not until the beginning of the last decade that the subject received serious consideration. The investigations of various workers in Europe and North America supplied the much needed stimulus in this direction, so that from 1935 the subject has been given more attention than before. In this paper is given a consolidated summary of the work done from 1935 to 1942. This includes a systematic survey of the incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae infection in some dairy herds. The main object has been to obtain some preliminary knowledge of the bacteriology of bovine mastitis in India. The work was started primarily to deter- mine the common bacterial types associated with it, and secondly, the extent to which Str. agalactiae, the most important and common cause of chronic streptococcus mastitis in other countries, is respon- sible for udder infections in this country. The. observations made are described under two sections I and II. SECTION I Under this head is described the preliminary work done from 1935 to 1940 to determine the types of bacteria associated with mastitis, and especially to see if Str. agalactiae could be commonly isolated. MATERIAL AND METHODS The material examined came, as a rule, from cows and buffaloes affected with clinical mastitis in the experimental dairy herds at Mukteswar or from different parts of the country. In the case of the Mukteswar cows, the material consisted of mixed udder milk or more commonly milk from affected quarters. The technique adopted was to streak the centrifuge deposit on blood or plain-agar slants for primary isolation of bacterial types. In many cases, cultures were obtained with a fair degree of purity. The material received from the field was generally milk or a more or less purulent udder secretion, swabs of milk or pus, and in one case a portion of the affected mammary gland preserved in glycerine. The cultural technique adopted with these specimens was similar to that used for milk from the Mukteswar cows. In many cases films of the udder secretion or milk deposit were also examined for bacteria and pus-cells. Many of the Mukteswar cows and a couple of ' field ' cows were reexamined. The bacteria isolated in pure culture and suspected of being connected with the disease were studied. In the early stages of the work, the system of classi- fication recommended by Bergey was used. This largely explains why Str. agalactiae, though probably present, was not definitely identified until 1939, after which it became the general practice to submit all the streptococcus strains to the biochemical tests now recommended for classifying mastitis streptococci. RESULTS Only the more important features are given below. 1. Streptococci. About 55 strains of streptococci were recovered from 45 animals (18 Mukteswar and 27 ' field' animals). Few of these strains were subjected to a thorough examination, so that the identifications recorded would not satisfy modern standards. The more definite and reliable specific labels are considered below. (a) Str. agalactiae. Str. agalactiae was isolated from ten cows and one buffalo ; seven of these were ' field ' cows. This number also includes one Str. mitior strain which on later examination proved to be Str. agalactiae. At least one other strain, which had been considered to belong to ' Mastitis Strepto- coccus, Group I ' (Minett, Stableforth and Edwards) may have been a true Str. agalactiae. but it was not available for further examination. (b) Str. mitior. Str. mitior was isolated from three cows, two of which were ' field ' cases, and one buffalo. Perhaps all, and certainly one of these strains should be regarded as Str. agalactiae. The buffalo strain was not available for further exami- nation, but the animal itself was two years later found to be infected with Str. agalactiae. (c) Str. uberis. Str. uberis was said to have been isolated from two ' field ' cows, but the diagnosis was based on incomplete study. Organisms labelled 'haemolytic diphtheroids ', probably Corynebac- terium pyogenes, were also recovered from these cows. (d) Str. subacidus. The characters of this orga- nism are fully described in Section II. Strains of streptococci possessing such characters were re- covered repeatedly from two Mukteswar cows. During the later survey work, one of these proved 173
174 Bacteriology of Bovine Mastitis in India to be infected with Str. agalactiae, but from the other Str. subacidus was again recovered. (e) Str. pyogenes. Str. pyogenes (i.e. strongly hae- molytic streptococci belonging to Lancefield's group A) was not isolated from a single case. 2. Staphylococci. Staphylococci considered to have pathogenic importance were isolated from about 20 animals. None of these strains was actually tested for its pathogenicity, but a few were found to be haemolytic and co-agulase positive. Their characters are further described in Section II. 3. Diphtheroids. Many of those isolated were obviously non-pathogenic. C. pyogenes was isolated in practically pure culture from purulent udder secretions of five 'field' cows and one 'field' buffalo. Two more strains from 'field' cows and labelled 'haemolytic diphtheroids' were pro- bably true C. pyogenes. In all these, there was a history of a suppurative mastitis. The cultural and other characters of these strains corresponded to those of classical C. pyogenes from mastitis and other disease conditions, viz. small Gram-positive orga- nisms, forming minute haemolytic zones in blood agar, digesting milk and gelatine and solid serum, and giving acid in lactose and not mannitol. Another character, perhaps not previously described, was their power of hydrolysing hippurate, like Str. agalactiae, but to a somewhat lesser extent, especially when grown in media containing a little ox-blood serum. This property was manifested by all the mastitis strains as well as by those from other sources. 4. Bacterium coli. Bact. coli and coliform organ- isms were isolated from several cows. From one cow and one buffalo at Mukteswar, haemolytic strains of Bact. coli were recovered repeatedly and this organism probably caused the somewhat acute mastitis occurring in these animals. 5. Mycobact. tuberculosis. Although a number of tests were made, there is but one case in which tuberculosis of the mammary gland was established by cultural and biological tests. 6. Miscellaneous bacteria. Among other bacteria of doubtful pathogenicity, the outstanding organisms were strains of Proteus and Pseudomonas. SECTION II. SYSTEMATIC SURVEY After Str. agalactiae as a cause of bovine mastitis in India had been definitely established, it was decided to institute a general survey of the incidence of udder infections due to this organism in a few organized dairy herds. The results are shown in Table I. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 541 cows, including four buffaloes, belonging to 15 dairy herds in different parts of the northern India, were examined. The 16 cows included as Herd 13 really consisted of animals admitted to the Punjab Veterinary College from various parts of Lahore ; they are herded in this way for descriptive purposes. Milk samples were taken from the individual quarters of nearly all cows available in the different herds. In a few cases, one or more teats were 'blind', and in each of two animals only one quarter was available. As the main object was to determine the incidence of Str. agalactiae infections and since it was also desired to make some simultaneous observations on the incidence of Staph. pyogenes infections, the cultural technique employed was essentially the same as that used by the English workers [Minett, 1934],. viz. to centrifuge about 10 c.c. of foremilk collected cleanly from individual quarters and to sow the. deposit in 5 per cent ox-blood agar plates. As a rule, two plates were made from each sample. In the first half of the deposit and in the second one-tenth of this amount was taken. When the deposits were particularly heavy or when there was reason to suspect a high bacterial count, plates were sown from further dilutions. Plates were examined at 24 and 48 hours incubation and the type of colonies noted. Suspicious colonies were transferred to one per cent serum broth for morphological study and purification (blood agar surface). Streptococci were tested in the following manner. Type of haemo- lysis was noted in the primary growths from the deposits. Intensity and character of growth in serum broth were noted after 24 and 48 hours and morphology was studied (chain formation, Gram- staining.). Fermentation tests were made in lactose, sucrose, mannitol, salicin, sorbitol, trehalose, raffinose and inulin, all in one per cent solutions and containing one per cent each of ox-serum and And- rade indicator. Also noted were final pH in glucose broth (one per cent), hydrolysis of sodium hip- purate, changes in litmus-milk and methylene blue- milk (1:20,000). Unless otherwise stated, observations were made during one week at 37ºC. RESULTS The main results are summarized below. Table I should be seen again. 1. Streptococci. One hundred and twenty-four strains of streptococci, isolated from 87 cows and one buffalo, belonging to 12 herds, were classified as follows. (a) Str. agalactiae was definitely diagnosed in two herds and suspicious strains were isolated from three more herds. The ten suspicious strains came from eight cows as follows : four from two cows at Izatnagar and six from six cows in the neighbour- hood of Lahore. The ten authentic strains of Str agalactiae were isolated from eight cows and one buffalo. Thus, in this survey the percentage of animals definitely infected with this organism is less than two.

Str. agalactiae was isolated from three cows and one buffalo. There were also one cow and one buffalo in this herd previously shown to be infected with Str. agalactiae. Two other cows, which were apparently free from patho- genic streptococci in this survey, were found to show Str. agalactiae at a previous examination (Section I), but the quarters from which these organisms were originally obtained were ' blind ' at the time of the survey. Obviously pathogenic streptococci were also recovered from five more cows of the same herd. It is interesting to note that in herd 2, Mukteswar, which consisted of the small Afghan and Kumaoni hill cows, Str. agalactiae was not encountered. From the second infected herd (Herd 3, Patna), six strains of Str. agalactiae were recovered from five of 83 cows examined. Seventeen more strains of strep- tococci, which could not be properly classified but which were probably of little pathogenic signi- ficance, were recovered from 13 other cows of this herd. The main cultural and biochemical characters used for classifying Str. agalactiae and possessed by all strains accepted as Str. agalactiae in this work were as follows.
176 Bacteriology of Bovine Mastitis in India Haemolysis. Str. agalactiae was easily recognized, by the comparatively small width, and weak charac- ter of the ß-haemolytic zones about the deep colonies in ox-blood agar plates after 24 hours incubation. Growth. Growth in one or 5 per cent serum broth was moderately abundant, with clear supernatant and floccular sediment, sometimes faintly pigmented. The sediment was composed of medium to long chains of Gram-positive cocci. Hydrolysis of sodium hippurate. This reagent was unmistakably hydrolysed (usual ferric chloride test, with unsown hippurate broth controls). Final pH in one per cent glucose broth. This was generally low, towards 4.2. Litmus-milk. Fair inocula produced rapid acidity with firm clot formation within 24 hours, with some decolourization at the bottom. On further incu- bation, a clear reddish whey was expressed. Methylene blue-milk. Generally, the results varied with the size of the inoculum. Small inocula failed to grow. Heavy inocula caused a complete reduction and clot formation within 24 hours, followed later by progressive oxidation from the top. Sugar reactions. All strains produced acid in lactose, sucrose, salicin and trehalose, but not in mannitol, sorbitol, raffinose and inulin. (b) Str. uberis. Str. uberis (Mastitis Streptococcus, Group III, of Minett et al.) was isolated from two cows at Mukteswar. Both were RAM NARAIN MOHAN 177 characteristic of 178 Genital Abnormalities of Indian Cow and Buffalo for many of the findings reported in Section I, and the latter did much of the work on animals at Lahore.

POLDING, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, and H. K. LALL, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 30 April 1945) (With Plates VI-XI) THIS work was commenced as part of a general investigation of sterility of cows and buffaloes, but it soon became clear that the present knowledge of the buffalo's genitalia is very slight indeed. Con- sequently, a short immediate contribution towards a better knowledge of this subject was deemed desirable. I. COMPARATIVE GENITAL ANATOMY Uterus. Plate VI depicts the uterus and adjacent organs of the cow and buffalo. As the average Punjab buffalo (Murrah type) is larger than the Punjab cow (Sahiwal type), so is the former's uterus generally larger than the latter's. Table I gives some comparative mean measurement of these organs The organs also differ considerably in their coloum and texture. The uterus of the zebu is cream- coloured and faintly tinged with pink, in the young animal and in the older, yellower like old ivory. The buffalo's uterus is whiter, and is stippled with TABLE I Some comparative measurements of the genitalia of the cow and buffalo* Part COW BUFFALO Means and their standard errors Standard deviations Coefficient of varia- bility per cent Means and their standard errors Standard deviations Coefficient of varia- bility per cent A.

The surface of the cow's uterus, except near its attach- ments, is satin-like, but that of the buffalo is faintly knotted both by the above-mentioned veins and by white convoluted striae. Again, a point of im- portance when making tactile examinations per rectum, except in the heifer, the ancestral uterus of the cow is comparatively flaccid and collapsed, but in the buffalo it is turgid and circular in cross- section (Plate VI). However, as the exact age and number of calvings of the animals examined were not known, these are approximate impressions gained, from handling numerous organs. A more exact knowledge requires a deeper intimacy with the genital cycle. Internally, the non-gravid cotyledons do not ob- viously differ, but it should be mentioned that, in either animal, the appearance of the resting coty- ledons is variable. Their apices may be dimpled, flat or rounded. Again, they may be ivory-pink, cafè-au-lait, or even dark-brown in colour. In younger animals, they are usually closely spaced, forming deep rugae ; in old animals, they may be almost unnoticeable. Williams [1921] and Quinlan [1929] attribute this variation to disease, but we feel that as yet insufficient evidence can be adduced to prove this contention. Fallopian tubes. The differential measurements of the fallopian tubes are given in Table I. The buffalo's are more deeply involved in the broad ligament than the cow's ; they are also coarser in appearance. Ovaries. It is difficult to compare the sizes of the ovaries for the normal variation within the species is considerable. Some measurements, how- ever, are given in Table I. Nevertheless, the disposition of the ovaries differs notably, for the cow's lie loosely in their attach- ments, whilst the buffalo's are more tightly secured. This may be why the buffalo's ovary is more difficult to locate per rectum. The ovaries also differ in appearance ; in the cows the immature follicles are superficial, mottling its surface and suggesting sub- superficial bubbles. The exterior of the buffalo's ovary, however, except where a follicle is maturing, is usually homogeneous. Ovarian cycle. The changes in the corpus luteum, even of the same species are never alike. Moreover, the colour of the corpus luteum alters when drying. In the colour-plates and description, therefore, an attempt has been made to give an average appear- ance of the ovarian variation. In the cow, the about-to-rupture follicle (Plate VII, fig. 1) is a slightly protruding sac, its wall being very thin at its apex. The follicle usually arises on the free curvature but occasionally it lies close to the ovarian attachments (Plate VIII, fig. 5). Wright (unpublished) fixes the mature follicle of the Euro- pean cow at 14 mm. diameter, while simultaneously various nascent follicles up to 5 mm. diameter appear elsewhere on the surface. After rupture, a blood clot, and then a haemorrhagic corpus luteum, 10-12 mm. diameter occupies the cavity. Natural rupture occurs towards the end of oestrus and the corpus luteum therefore forms during early post- oestrus (two to three days after rupture). Two or three days later the corpus luteum reaches 12 to 15 mm. diameter. Regrettably a specimen of this phase could not be illustrated, but Wright (personal communications) describes the colour as cream, and McNutt [1924] as light brown. At this stage a small portion of luteal substance often protrudes through the aperture of rupture. McNutt [1924] says protrusions are very inconstant ; in the present specimens they occurred in 54.5 per cent of 16 mature corpora lutea. Subsequent stages of the luteal cycle are reproduced diagrammatically in Plate VII. There is some disagreement about the periods of maturation and regression of the corpus luteum, but enlargement is known to last at least 12 and, in the opinion of some, 17 days. However, it seems safe to state that the body and protrusion enlarge rapidly during the first half of the cycle and remain about maximum until the seventeenth day. In the present work, the average diameter of mature bodies was 20 mm. the protrusion measur- ing about 5×10 mm. in the early stages and 10×28 mm. at maximum. During maturation, the colour of the corpus luteum changes from stone or buff to bright yellowish orange, but the protrusion often remains haemorr- hagic (Plate VII, fig. 2 represents 6 to 8 day body and fig. 3 represents 12 to 17 day body). After con- ception, the body, apart from losing its haemorrhagic appearance, persists, unchanged both in size and colour, as the corpus luteum of pregnancy. Failing conception, the corpus luteum starts to regress about the seventeenth day or a little earlier. The hæ- morrhagic appearance of the protrusion disappears within a week and the entire body becomes yellow (Plate VII, fig. 4). The corpus luteum shrinks and the protrusion becomes overgrown by the adjacent ovarian tissue180 Genital Abnormalities of Indian Cow and Buffalo because, failing previous oestra history, the age of a corpus luteum after three weeks can only be guessed by the appearance of further regular ovarian acti- vity ; but in historyless slaughterhouse specimens there is nothing to show whether one or more æstral periods have been missed or, whether an intermediate false heat has occurred. In the buffalo, the immature follicles are not generally so superficial and the mottling of the sur- face of the ovary is therefore not often present. The thinning of the apex of the maturing follicle is less noticeable than in the cow. In this work, follicles varied from 5 to 16 mm. diameter, but those easily rupturable ranged from 10 to 16 mm. A maturing, but as yet not superficial follicle on a cut face of the gland, appears at Plate VIII, fig. 1. At Plate VIII, fig. 2, is illustrated a recently and naturally ruptured follicle filled with blood clot and coagulum. Plate VIII, fig. 5 illustrates an unrup- tured, nearly mature follicle (left extremity of the gland). McNutt [1924] says there is no haemorrhage into the recently ruptured follicle of the cow, but in the buffalo, at least, this appears to occur. The newly formed corpus luteum is about 13 mm. diameter and is pinkish-grey, veined with red (Plate VIII, fig. 3). This veining, together with a whorling of the luteal substance, gives the cut surface of the corpus luteum a marbled appearance characteristic of the buffalo. At this stage a small haemorrhagic protrusion is usually present. Enlargement up to 20 mm. diameter continues until several days before the next follicle ruptures but, unlike the cow, the greyish-pink veined coloration remains; and it is notable that never during the cycle is the luteal substance yellow. The protrusion is sometimes very large indeed, often larger than the body itself (Plate VIII, fig. 5). In the event of conception, the corpus luteum remains at its maximum (Plate VIII, fig. 9) and the peculiar greyish-green depicted in the plate is not uncommonly encountered, either during pregnancy or when the corpus luteum is mature. As regression occurs, the red-veining of the body and haemorrhage on the protrusion dis- appears, and the whole turns white (Plate VIII, figs. 6 and 7). Then the protrusion becomes over- grown and the corpus luteum sinks into the stroma. Later the body becomes stone coloured and 5 to 7 mm. diameter (Plate VIII, fig. 8). In the buffalo, luteal protrusions were slightly commoner than in the cow, viz. in 58.8 per cent of 71 observed cases. Their size varied from 3 to 10 mm., the largest being 16 mm. diameter, and their apices were mostly very haemorrhagic. McNutt [1924] mentions central cavities in the corpus luteum of the cow, but such were not observed in those of the Indian zebu. In the buffalo, however, they were relatively common varying from 3 to 5 mm. diameter. II. SOME PATHOLOGICAL CONDITION OF THE GENI TALIA OF PUNJAB COWS AND BUFFALOES The organs examined in this work were ex-slaugh terhouse and presumably a large proportion were animals condemned for sterility. On this account with the exception of metritis, no figures of lesion incidence have been attempted while inter-species comparison has likewise been avoided. Metritis. Among the uteri of 45 cows and 185 buffaloes, the mucosae of 15 (33 per cent) and 37 (20 per cent) respectively were congested. Metritis therefore, is relatively common in the Punjab cattle Two common types of metritis were distinguished Indian J. vet.

J. B. POLDING AND H. K. LAL 181 age causes persistent infection hereabouts and. not elsewhere. Two cases of pyometra have been noted in the zebu ; the uteri contained three or four pints of milky fluid ; the uterine walls were distended, thin and atonic, whilst the mucosa, especially of the horns, was deeply congested and in places necrotic. In one the cervix also was severely inflamed (Plate [X, fig. 2). The ovaries of both contained central cavities probably cysts. Nielson [1926] contends that retained corpora lutea occur only secondarily, resulting from chronic, pyometric endometritis. In these specimens corpora lutea were not re- tained. A single case of tubercular metritis was found in a buffalo. The uterine wall contained hard, caseous, pea-sized nodules, packed with acid-fast baccilli. The nodules might have been palpable per rectum. Cervicitis. Few cases of cervicitis were seen. The only outstanding example is illustrated at Plate IX. More frequently a few streaks and patches of slight congestion were observed but, because the butchers severed the organ near the cervix, these may have been artifacts. Abnormalities of the fallopian tubes. Simple sal- pingitis was not seen in the cow, but was twice found in the buffalo. The tubes were hardened and thickened suggesting chronicity. In one the attendant ovary was embedded in the broad liga- ment and, together with the opposite ovary, was afunctional. Five other fallopian lesions were found in the buffalo ; in all, one or both tubes were blind at the ovarian end. In four the uteri were congested, their horn tips being indurated and cartilaginous with the lumen constricted (2-3 mm. diameter) and tortuous. The induration formed a separ- able core in the horn tip. Ovarian abnorma- lities occurred in four of these specimens. Williams [1921] describing salpingitis says that as the disease progresses, the pavilion is always involved and may be closed, either by adhesions within the funnel or with the ovary ; the ovary may then become encap- sulated in the ovarian pocket, and the tube dis- tended with fluid. Williams denotes the condition as 'hydrosalpinx'. He believes the lesion results from metritis and associates it with cystic corpora lutea. The authors' specimens agree with Williams' description as to the occurrence of metritis in four, luteal cysts in one and encapsulation of the ovary in two cases. But, in all five, no obvious inflam- mation, either past or present could be detected in the tubes ; the blind ends were usually attached to the ovary normally whilst, on resection, they were lined by apparently normal fimbriæ. This is unlike Quinlan's [1929] description who writes of 'enlongated mucous folds occluding the tube and forming septa'. Further, whilst in hydrosalpinx the tubes contain fluid, in four of the present speci- mens they held gas, which could not be evacuated into the uterus by pressure. The inflated portion resembled, in miniature, a child's toy sausage balloon, and pneumosalpinx seems a more descrip- tive name. Three specimens of this lesion were preserved and are illustrated in Plate X. In one the distension (bottom right, Plate X, fig. 1) was 34×1.5 cm., both ovaries were normal and functional, but the last quarter of the uterine horn on the affected side was indurated (bottom left, Plate X, fig. 1). In the second specimen both tubes were affected, the left terminating in a gas-filled sac like a small walnut (bottom left, Plate X, fig. 2). The encapsulated left ovary contained immature follicles. The right uninflated tube was also blind, its attendant ovary being functional but encapsulated (the resected ovaries can be distinguished in Plate X, fig. 2, inside the curvature of the horns). Metritis was also present. The blind end of the left tube of the third specimen was attached to the ovary by a fibrous cord (right centre, Plate X, fig. 3). The tip of the horn was indurated and contained a core (extreme left, Plate X, fig. 3). This tube con- tained fluid not gas. The attendant encapsulated ovary was fibrous and afunctional and contained a cavity about 7 mm. diameter. (Plate X, fig. 3, centre). The right ovary was functional. Of the two un- illustrated specimens, the left tubes only were affected ; in one the left ovary was afunctional, the right continued a cystic corpus luteum ; in the other the left ovary was afunctional, but the right was normal. Ovarian abnormalities (a) Abnormal disposition of the ovary. In the buffalo but not in the cow, the encapsulation of the ovary varying from a partial enclosure, where ova might still be discharged, to a total encapsula- tion was common. In some ovaries, exposed parts were crossed and recrossed with fibrous cords. In all but one of these ovaries, corpora lutea indicated function, but in one (Plate XI, fig. 1) a luteal body consisted of a thin-walled cavity; Whether (this ovarian encapsulation resulted from infection of the fallopian tubes is problematical, because the tubes of three of the cases were macroscopically unchanged. (b) Dermoid tumours. Teratomata were record- ed in four buffalo ovaries. Three were small pea- like bodies with a hard shell enclosing a dense coagulum, sometimes comingled with hairs (Plate XI, figs. 3, A ànd C). The fourth was like a small walnut. In. three cases the ovaries were functional ; in a fourth (unillustrated) the ovarian tissue was almost replaced by a cyst. Nevertheless, the little remaining tissue had functioned recently B

In specimen 1 (Plate XI, fig. 2) multiple cysts entirely replaced the left ovary. The right ovary was normal and functional. In specimen 2 (Plate XI, fig. 3 B, right hand extremity) the anterior part of the ovary consisted of a single sac (25 mm. diameter) containing coagulum. The sheath of this cyst was continuous with the ovarian covering; the ovary was nearly intact, but its stroma contained a central cavity 4 mm. in diameter. The third case simulated the second. (d) Cysts of the corpus luteum. Luteal cysts were noted in the cow and in the buffalo. Many corpora lutea contain small central cavities (about 3 mm. diameter) appearing as a parting between the whorls of substance. It is difficult therefore to define normality. In some of these cases, however, the luteal body was thinly walled cavity frequently containing a whitish coagulum. Table II gives some comparative sizes of corpora lutea and their cavities. Luteal cysts are to be seen in Plate XI, Figs 4, A and C. In Plate XI, fig. 4 B, a. white central coagulum can be observed.

MURTY, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 25 January 1945) DEFICIENCY in the supply of protein is one of the thief limiting factors in formulating balanced rations. According to Wright's [1937] estimate, only 0.079 lb. of digestible crude protein is available per day for an animal weighing 500 lb. as compared with the normal requirements of 0.3 lb. This deficiency is aggravated in times of famine and war. During the first great war, oedema, which has been ascribed by Knack and Neumann [1917], Kohman [1920] and Maver [1920] to lack of protein in the diet, occurred among the famine-stricken population of Central Europe [Peters and Van Slyke, 1932]. Krishnan [1944] also observed it during the 1943 Bengal famine. In our experimental animals, oedema of the feet and eyelids was observed when they had been kept on a protein-deficient ration for about three months. In view of the common prevalence of protein deficiency in livestock in India and the lack of information on blood changes which could be used for the diagnosis of this condition, a systematic study was made of the various blood components of cattle maintained on a low-nitrogen ration for a considerable period as compared with those of cattle on a normal ration. Details of the low-nitrogen and the nitrogen-free rations used are given in a previous article [Kehar Mukherjee and Sen, 1943]. Nine Hariana bullock were maintained on a low-nitrogen ration for 29 day and subsequently on a nitrogen-free ration for 2 days. Prior to this, the animals had been kep on a sub-maintenance level of protein allowance for about two months. The control animals were fed on a balanced ration. Animals of both groups were adults and apparently in good health. Blood was drawn by jugular puncture after 12 hours fasting. The following morphological and chemical constituents were studied : Total red cells, total and differential white cell counts, cell volume, hæmo globin, iron, sugar, cholesterol, inorganic phosphorus calcium, magnesium, total nitrogen, non-protein nitrogen and the protein fractions. All the mor phological constituents were studied by Napie and Das Gupta's [1941] methods. Observations were made in duplicate and the average values are given in Tables I to III. TABLE I Blood constituents in normal and protein-deficient bullocks 184 Blood Changes in Cattle fed on protein-deficient diet Red cells. The average red cell count in the control group (Table I) was 7.7 millions (minimum 5.8 ; maximum 9.8), while that in the protein-deficient group was 6.48 millions (minimum 5.8 ; maximum 8.4) per c.mm. These observations are in confor- mity with those of Weech et al [1937] on dogs and of Kyer and Bethal [1938] on rats, though Orten and Orten [1940] found the erythrocyte count to be nearly normal in rats fed on a low nitrogen diet from the time of weaning up to 100 days of age. White cells. The average white cell count was 7.7 thousands per c. mm. (minimum 5.7 : maximum 9.7) in normal animals as compared with 7.14 thousands (minimum 6.4 ; maximum 8.0) in the low-protein group (Table I). White cell per cent distribution. From a perusal of the differential leucocytic counts in Table I, it appears that there is no significant difference between the normal and the protein-deficient group except in eosinophiles. Ordinarily, it might indicate helminthiasis, but repeated examinations of the faeces of the animals revealed no helminth ova. Cell volume. The average cell volume per cent (Table I) was 50.6 (minimum 43 ; maximum 57) in the normal animals and 45.4 (minimum 37 ; maximum 58) in the protein-deficient animals. The results obtained by Shelburne [1934] and Weech et al [1937] in dogs, Kyer and Bethall [1938] in rats are in agreement with our findings on bullocks. Corpuscular values. The average values for mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hæmoglobin, and mean corpuscular hæmoglobin concentration (Table I) are 68.7 Cu µ (minimum 43.8 ; maximum 86.2), 14.9 NARAIN DAS KEHAR AND V. V. S. MURTY 185 Total cholesterol. For cholesterol estimation the technique described by Banerji [1933] was followed. The average values for cholesterol (Table II) fell from 186 mg. per cent in the control group to 115 mg. in the low protein group. Shelburne [1934] and Page et al. [1937], however, found that the change from normal to low protein diet had no consistent effect on the cholesterol content of the blood. Calcium. Serum calcium was determined by Clark and Collip's [1925] modification of Kramer and Tisdall's [1921] method. The average values for serum calcium as shown in Table II are 10.4 (minimum 9.4 ; maximum 11.2) mg. per cent in the control group and 9.7 (minimum 8.2 ; maximum 10.3) mg. per cent in the protein-deficient group. Similar results were obtained by Wang et al. [1930- 31] with young women on low-nitrogen diet. Magnesium. Serum magnesium was estimated by the method of Fiske and Subbarow [1925] as modified by Holzapfel [1934]. Average values for the control group were 2.78 (minimum 2.61 ; maxi- mum 3.06) and 2.54 (minimum 1.76 ; maximum 3.15) mg. per cent for the protein-deficient group. Inorganic phosphorus. Serum inorganic phos- phorus was estimated by the method of Fiske and Subbarow [1925]. Average values for the control and protein-deficient groups are 4.26 mg. per cent (minimum 3.70 ; maximum 6.20) and 4.11 (mini- mum 3.32 ; maximum 5.67) mg. per cent respectively. Protein fractions. Serum protein fractions were estimated by the method devised by Campbell and Hanna [1937] with slight modifications adopted by Kehar et al. [1940]. TABLE III Serum-protein fractions in normal and protein-deficient bullocks (gm. per cent) 186 Methods of Yoking Bullocks both the euglobulin and pseudoglobulin I farctions are less in the protein-deficient than in the control group. Since globulins are associated with the maintenance of body integrity, it may be that the decreased amounts of these immunologically active fractions in protein deficiency render the animals more susceptible to infection. SUMMARY Observations on the morphological and chemical constituents of the blood of normal cattle and of those fed on a protein-deficient diet are presented. It has been found that the red cells, white cells, cell volume, sugar, haemoglobin, iron, total choleste- rol, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium, non- protein nitrogen and the protein fractions are decreased in protein-deficient animals. As the globulins are especially associated with the integrity of the body cells, it may be that the decreased amounts of these immunologically active fractions in protein-deficient animals render them more suscept- ible to infection.

We believed that the results of such a study, even if negative, would be of value. It would show that some basis of selection other than such measurements is necessary. Information as to the extent to which a certain body conformation is desirable or necessary for maximum draft ability would help to settle the controversy over whether it is possible to have a dual purpose breed or not. If we were to test the draft ability of the animal, it seemed necessary that the animal be tested with a yoke or harness which enabled it to exert its maxi- mum strength. There are widely differing types of yokes in use in India which appear to differ in the extent to which they allow the animal to use his strength. Aside from its bearing on this scheme, information about the effect of the yoke on the ability of a pair of animals to pull a load would be useful in practice. If yokes really differ as much as they appear to, there should be marked advantage in. selecting the best one for general use. The adoption of a yoke which would increase the power delivered 10 per cent would be equivalent to adding the power of about 5,500,000 work animals to the power avail- able to the Indian farmer. (There are 55,794,864 bovine work animals in India188 Methods of Yoking Bullocks animal. By the time that the spirit of enquiry had spread sufficiently and the numbers of research workers had increased to the point where such pro- blems might have had more serious attention, the development of the internal combustion engine, applied particularly to the tractor, had progressed to the stage where it seemed likely to displace animal power in agriculture. If animal power was to be displaced, there seemed little value in studying it or in trying to improve it or its application. This probably largely accounts for the scarcity of litera- ture on the subject. A few efforts have been traced to improve yokes in India. Krishnamurty of the Madras Veterinary College designed an improved yoke but it was not included in the types of yokes reported in common use in Madras by the Director of Agriculture. Simi- larly, Mushtaq Ahmad of the Punjab Veterinary College designed an improved yoke which was not included in the types reported by the Director of Agriculture, Punjab, in response to our enquiries for designs to be tested. A 'yoke' or wooden collar was designed for a single bullock at Poona Agricultural College and was included in the types submitted by the Director of Agriculture, Bombay, and a similar yoke with no reference to origin was included in those reported used in Gwalior. Charley at Coimbatore designed a leather strap harness for a single bullock, described in leaflet No. 85 of the Department of Agriculture, Madras. No publication which has come to attention gives any information on com- parative usefulness of any of these, the published material being confined to descriptions and to the uses to which they may be put. In some cases, authors make claims of superiority but do not cite tests to prove the claims. No foreign publication has come to our attention from anywhere in the world dealing with tests of harness or yokes. The field therefore seems to be a completely virgin one, unexplored and apparently practically undiscovered. The literature on the testing of animals is scant but not quite non-existent. Bulletin 240, October 1926, of the Agricultural Experiment Station, Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, by Collins and Caine, devotes 28 pages to 'Testing Draft Horses'. This is the only publication in English devoted primarily to discussing tests of draft horses which has come to our attention. 'Investigation of the Working Performance of Swiss Cattle' by Hans Wenger, Bern, 1939, is the only study of the draft ability of bovine animals which has been available during this study. It is in German and no English translation has been found. Wenger lists a bibliography of 58 items, only three being in English, one a work on statistical methods, on the bulletin by Collins and Caine referred to above and the third a study by Brody of Missouri University. From a translation of the index and summary, it does not appear to contain anything on the question of harness or yoking nor does the biblio- graphy refer to any publication on the subject. With such a scarcity of work done on draft power, it is not surprising that there is little material available on methods and equipment for testing draft power. Wenger gives a detailed description of the loading car which he used, which is of the general type described by several other workers, particularly Collins and Caine. Collins and Caine in Iowa State Bulletin 210 des- cribe three variations of a traction dynamometer car for testing animals as follows : 'In the first dynamometer, built for this work provision was made for hitching each of two horses to weights in a manner similar to that shown in fig, 2, In this case the tractive pull resulting from lifting the weights is more than enough to propel the dynamo- meter and it is necessary to apply some resistance to hold the machine back. This was done by gearing the rear wheels to a rotary pump and then regulating the discharge from the pump to produce the desired resistance. This regulation was made automatic by connecting the valve so that it is operated by a change in the height of the weights relative to the frame.' 'When the weights are at the bottom the valve is closed and the rear wheels are locked. As the weights are lifted the valve gradually opens until at the top it is wide open and the pump furnishes a minimum of resistance. In action this automatic control allows the dynamometer to move just fast enough to keep the weights suspended whenever the team is moving. The condition of the road surface or the grade does not affect the amount of work done by the team but merely requires that more or less resistance must be furnished by the pump. The tractive pull exerted by the team is constant and equal to the sum of the weights which are held sus- pended.' 'In action, then, the tractive force required to move the dynamometer (variable) plus the resistance furnished by the pump (governed by position of weights) is equal to the tractive pull exerted by the team (constant). The dynamometer, of course, has practical limits. On slippery roads it is difficult to get enough traction for the wheels, in which case the weights would not be lifted and the team would be exerting a tractive force something less than the weights. On the other hand where the roads are extremely soft or a very steep hill is encountered, it is quite possible that the tractive pull required to move the machine itself will be greater than the amount of the weights. This may readily occur if only a light load were applied. In such a case the weights would strike the top of their guides and the team would be exerting a greater tractive pull than the amount of the weights.'
M. VAUGH 189 'The dynamometer as built was equipped to furnish a tractive resistance for each horse which could be varied from 60 to 350 pounds.' 'In order to test horses for their maximum effort for short periods, a larger machine was built. This dynamometer is shown in figs. 5 and 6. This operates in essentially the same way as the smaller machine just described but differs in constructional details and in capacity. In the construction of the machine, the chassis of a Nash quad four-wheel drive truck was used. The engine of the truck was replaced with a rotary pump so that the same train of gearing could be used to drive the pump. The team in this case is hitched to a double tree and only one set of weights is used. The weights are made of reinforced con- crete and normally rest upon the frame as shown. Each of the weights may be attached to the weight beam by turning a lock on the beam. The valve controlling the discharge from the pump is so con- nected to the weight beam that the valve is closed when the beam is at the top. By this means the forward movement of the truck is regulated auto- matically so that the weights will always be lifted while the dynamometer is in motion. This machine has a maximum capacity of 4,100 pounds tractive pull and a total weight of 10,000 pounds.' 'The machine shown in figs. 7 and 8 was also built for testing horses for their maximum effort. It is mounted on the rear of a Ford truck chassis and as the engine was not removed, the truck can be readily transported with its own power. The large weights used are cast iron disks weighing 250 pounds each. As many of these as desired may be attached to the lifting cable. Small increments of weight may be added by placing them in the space provided between the two top weights. As shown in the diagram (fig. 7) a pulley is so connected to the cables that 500 pounds tractive effort is required on the hitch to support each 250 pounds weight. This was necessary in order to keep the total weight of the machine as low as possible. A special sprocket attaches to the rear of the worm shaft and drives the pump by means of a roller chain. The lever operating the pump discharge-valve is connected to the weights, so that the valve is closed when the weights are resting on the frame and wide -open when the weights are at the top of their guides. By this means, just enough resistance is automatically applied at all times to the forward movement of the dynamometer to keep the weights suspended. The height at which the weights are carried depends upon the speed of the team, the amount of weights attached and the road surface, but is of no importance as long as the weights are not touching either the top or bottom of the guides.' This machine has a maximum capacity of 3,200 pounds tractive pull and a total weight of 5,230 pounds. In order to get enough traction for average road conditions, it is necessary to use skid chains on the rear wheels and to put a skid under the front wheels as shown in fig. 8. For loads very near the maximum, additional weight is applied to the truck body. This is usually accomplished by getting men to stand on the platform.' 'For transportation it is only necessary to dis- connect the tongue and skids, load them on the plat- form and take off the roller chain which drives the pump.' 'This type of machine has been further improved by the addition of a three-speed auxiliary transmis- sion with power take off attachment. This pro- vides six forward speeds for transporting the machine, and the power take off provides a more suitable method of driving the pump; otherwise no important changes have been made. The machine is illustrated in fig. 9.' It will be noted that the first dynamometer car described by Collins and Caine and those described by European workers are designed to give working loads. The two latter described by Collins and Caine are designed primarily to test maximum draft ability, though by suitable adjustment it is possible to use them for smaller loads also. Broady and fellow workers used a tread mill apparatus instead of a loading car, which they have described in Missouri Bulletins 209 and 383. The principle of the tread mill is that the backward push of the animal's feet tends to move the travelling belt on which the animal stands. This allows the animal to stand in one place, which may be under a shelter. In this way it is possible to have a uniform unvarying footing on which the animal works and which is independent of weather conditions. They first experimented with loading the animal by using the tread mill to drive an oil pump in the same way as was used on the Iowa loading car by Collins and Caine. This proved unsatisfactory, possibly due to the tread mill being in bad mechanical repair. They later loaded the animal by making it lift weights. M. A. Sharp described a simple traction dyna- mometer for maximum draft tests in Vol. 22, No. 1, dated January 1941, of the Agricultural Engineering Journal. This consists essentially of a two-wheeled cart made from the back axle of a lorry or car with a platform and draft rig added to it. It also carries a roller, on which a rope can be wound, fitted with brake drums and brakes, which, when tightened, resist the rotation of the roller. The roller is also geared to a device, such as a car jack, which can be used to progressively set the brakes as the roller revolves. Rotation of the roller is secured by un- winding the rope, the other end of which is fastened to a tree or stake. The apparatus is prepared for a test by winding the rope on the roller with the brakes slack and the team or single animal hitched to the C
190 Methods of Yoking Bullocks car. As the animal moves forward, the rope is pulled off the roller, setting the brakes and increasing the resistance to rotation of the roller. As the car can only move forward as the rope is allowed to unwind from the roller, increasing the resistance to rotation of the roller also increases the resistance to forward movement of the car. The animal or animals continue to go forward till the resistance of the car equals the effort they can or will exert under the degree of urging applied. In this case the pull rises continuously to a maximum and must be measured by some indicating or recording device interposed in the hitch from the animals to the car. There is somewhat more literature on recording apparatus for measuring draft. Most commercial apparatus available is very expensive and not avail- able in India and difficult to import in wartime. Even if available, none of it seemed entirely satis- factory in one or another respect. The greatest drawbacks, however, were non-availability and cost. Collins describes the Iowa traction integrating dynamometer. This instrument is fairly suitable for use with some types of apparatus but did not seem suitable for our purpose, in addition to being un- available in a reasonable time. The bibliography at the end of this report gives references to various articles on recording apparatus. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The decision as to which type of apparatus to use was difficult. It was finally decided to use two types of apparatus for the different parts of the ex- periment. Sharp's simple dynamometer car for the testing of yokes and a tread mill for the testing of animals. This choice was partly dictated by the fact that the dynamometer car could be cheaply and quickly made available while the tread mill had to be constructed and would take time. The tread mill type of apparatus was chosen for the latter study of effect of body conformation on draft ability because it facilitated the use of certain auxiliary apparatus which will be discussed in the report on that part of the study and because it made standar- dization of conditions easy. The lack of any satisfactory recording type of apparatus made it necessary to choose an indicating method of measuring the draft. Not even an indicat- ing dynamometer scale was available, so a large Salter's spring balance was adapted to the purpose by adding a second pointer which would record the maximum pull exerted in any one test. While this has worked reasonably well, it is hoped that a record- ing unit will be available in the second part of the study. The choice of just what to measure was even more difficult than how to measure it. It was recognised that animals do not, when doing ordinary work, continuously exert the maximum power of which they are capable. A commonly accepted standard for loading horses is that the ordinary draft should not exceed one-tenth of the live weight. The Physiolo- gical Chemist in the Scientific Reports of the Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research, Pusa, 1933-34, in reporting some tests carried out at Pusa, says, 'In these tests the draft has been one-fifth to one- sixth (of the body weight) and yet the animals did not show any suffering.' What we wanted to know was the maximum load which a given animal could pull in ordinary kinds of work for ordinary work periods, day after day. Theoretically, this meant a load which would result in a state of fatigue at the end of the work period, beyond which it would be undesirable or dangerous to go. We found no method of testing the state of fatigue and no standard maximum state of fatigue which an animal could bear. It is known of course that if an animal or a man works beyond his normal capacity, he loses condition, becomes leaner and eventually may develop other symptoms, or even collapse entirely, if the overloading is carried to great extremes. Such effects ordinarily only show up after long periods, too long at least for us to use them for purposes of this research. Various methods, such as blood analyses, were suggested as 'possibly' offering a means of determining fatigue. These did not seem suitable because there was no standardized procedure or any correlation known between the results of the analysis and the degree of fatigue. To have tried to work out such standards would have taken more time than was available. Collins and Caine say 'It is practically impossible at present to determine the state of fatigue of an animal. Ex- perienced horsemen may observe the general condition of an individual but they cannot determine the actual physical condition and know exactly if the horse is approaching a state of fatigue. In two years of experimental work where horses were pulling loads equivalent to a horse power or more for eight hours per day, day after day, they showed no out- ward signs of a fatigued condition;....'. Since we found no end point which could be definitely determined, in tests using loads comparable to ordinary working loads, it was necessary to choose something for our tests which could be definitely determined. We realized that we do not yet know exactly the relation between the maximum load an animal or pair of animals can pull and the load they should be expected to pull day after day. Horse pulling contests and other testing in America has shown however that, in general, pulling contests are generally wonM. VAUGH 191 The applicability of the maximum pull to testing of yokes seems even more definite. Presumably, ability to pull a given load will be limited by one of two things, the strength of the muscles or the unit pressure under the yoke on the neck. The unit pressure under the yoke as the result of a given draft load will depend on the shape of the yoke and of the animal's neck192 Methods of Yoking Bullocks As we neared the end of the first series of tests, an attempt was made to analyse the results. The results were averaged, plotted in various ways and studied statistically. There appeared to be quite significant differences between the pairs of bullocks, but the differences between the yokes were not statisti- cally significant. Study of the data seemed to indi- cate that it did not prove the lack of difference be- tween yokes, but rather that our testing had not been under sufficiently controlled conditions, parti- cularly with regard to the handling of the bullocks. The data showed too great difference between the high and low readings, indicating that in some cases the bullocks had exerted abnormal effort and that in others they had shirked. Results of every test had been recorded in an attempt to avoid anything which might resemble 'doctoring' the datta. The effect was somewhat that of including in a series of analyses for nitrogen, samples into which had flies in the course of the digestion. Whether to include any given test or not presented a real difficulty. Obviously, when the bullocks ran and came up at the end of the test with a jerk, the maximum pull would be abnormal and it was easy to discard such test. Tests when the bullocks shirked were more difficult. Determining the standard of urging to be used was not easy. It might vary all the way from whispered commands to severe beating. This seemed to be the biggest variable and the most difficult to control. It seemed definite that we should not determine which data to record by the magnitude of the reading. It was decided therefore, after consulting with Dr Sukhatme, Statistician of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, to again run through the tests, using a fewer number of trials of each yoke and attempting to control the conditions more carefully. We decided to try to determine which trials to discard before reading the dynamo- meter scale by carefully watching the animals during the test. We therefore randomized the order in which the yokes were to be tested and ran the whole 15 again, making only five tests on each yoke and using one pair of bullocks. When this series of tests was completed and the results were studied, it appeared that they were more consistent than the first series. To make sure, we again ran a similar series of tests, with a new randomization order, making five tests each. Three such replications were made to see if we could duplicate the results. The results of the replications were consistent, showing only the variation which would be reasonable when working with animals. The results of the three replications of five tests with each pair of bullocks were combined, TABLE 1 Average pull of bullock with double yokes Bullocks Pull in pounds for each yoke (Average of 15 observations) Team No. Weight in lb. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Aver- age 34 & 35 . . 1,515 812 847 885 815 622 841 775 775 810 808 804 799 788 739 791 823 745 793 15 & 24 . . 1,795 919 899 890 945 688 909 892 911 884 931 931 882 879 898 913 856 814 885 32 & 36 . . 1,455 872 902 908 920 737 926 857 924 882 870 898 889 877 893 901 847 805 877 3 & 4 . 1,625 923 953 919 885 824 800 836 894 875 857 873 837 880 910 881 859 809 866 13 & 14 1,425 833 752 791 775 735 797 768 767 760 716 845 769 771 806 773 779 737 775 Average pull per yoke .. 872 861 879 868 721 854 826 853 842 836 870 835 839 849 852 852 782 ..

Nos. 13 and 14 are modifications of the same ke in an attempt to get smaller and larger areas of ntact between neck and yoke. No. 5 was made the design of Mushtaq Ahmed as an 'improved' ke No. 17 was modification of the 'improved' ke to Madras design. These measurements do not give any very clear clue to why one yoke is better or worse than another. The two worst yokes according to these tests showed the largest and the smallest areas in contact with the neck. The measurement of the area in contact with the neck was perhaps the least satisfactory measure- ment made. Various methods were tried and none was found very satisfactory. The method finally adopted was to smear the yoke with lamp black mixed with oil; then the yoke was carefully placed on the neck and pressed firmly down and back to get an impression. The yoke was then removed and placed on the ground, and a soft copper wire was bent to fit the shape of the impression. The wire shape was then carefully transferred to a sheet of graph paper and the area carefully determined by counting the squares. The areas so determined are only approximate. There is some reason to believe that the area recorded for No. 5 is high, but this did not invalidate the results as will be shown later. The weight of the yoke also does not appear to be a factor, at least within the limits of the weights of the yokes
194 Methods of Yoking Bullocks tested. The best group included the heaviest and some of the lighter yokes while the lightest yoke is near the bottom of the list. If anything, the evidence would be in favour of a heavy yoke. No other factor stands out as definitely explaining the superiority of one yoke over another.

Sketches of yokes TESTS OF SINGLE BULLOCK HITCHES After completing the tests of yokes for pairs, it seemed desirable to investigate the usefulness of single animal hitches. In the replies from the Directors of Agriculture, Gwalior and Bombay had described essentially the same single bullock yoke of wood. Charley's leather harness had come to atten- tion otherwise. In anticipation of these tests, an American horse collar had been imported and a similar collar had been made locally. A hitch known as a 'birh' is in common use in the area of Allahabad for hitching a single bullock in front of a cart when three animals are required, or for drawing a hand cart when only one animal is used. The imported collar was found to be too big for use on the animals available for tests and so was discarded. In studying the results of the tests for yokes for pairs, it appeared that probably the poor results from the tests of yoke No. 5 was due to the fact that it fixed the distance between the bullocks quite rigidly, allowing them very little freedom of individual movement and that

Yokes of the general type represented by types 1, 3, 4, 11 are definitely better than some others, especially types 12, 16, 7, 17, 5. 2. Yokes which definitely restrict side movement of the bullocks are undesirable. 3. Except for the restraint of side movement, no very clearly defined reason for the superiority of one yoke over another has appeared from these studies. 4. The training and control of the bullocks very greatly affect the results.

V. DESAI and M. L. MATHUR, Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi (Received for publication on 2 September 1944) (With 12 text-figures) HART et al. [1908] observed that when calcium and phosphorus were deficient in quantity in food, the skeletal tissues appeared to be the ready source of supply for milk secreted and there was consider- able output of these elements from the gut. If conditions of negative balances continued for a long time a slow shrinkage in milk flow results, but there was no physiological disturbance. In their later observations [1920], they reported a serious effect on reproduction. Even though Forbes et al. [1916-18] in their experiments provided for an ample intake of calcium and phosphorus in rich diet containing
S. V. DESAI AND M. L. MATHUR 199 alfalfa hay and salts, larger amounts were eliminated than were ingested. Meigs, Blatherwick, and Cary [1919] found that dry pregnant cows were not assi- milating calcium from calcium-rich rations, but were actually transferring calcium, salts from their skeleton for building the foetal skeleton. Hart, Steenbock and Hoppert [1921] observed that in dry and milking goats calcium assimilation was greater when green instead of dry oats were fed. Cod liver oil (5-10 c.c. per day) consistently changed a negative to a positive balance. Hart el al. [1922] found that high-yielding cows were maintained in positive calcium and phosphorus balance on dry alfalfa hay, corn silage and grain mixture. Their subsequent findings [1922], in which timothy hay was used, are not in harmony with the observations quoted above. Bone-meal supplement did not bring about positive balance. Forbes et al. [1922] found that the calcium of the bones was more readily available for purposes of milk elaboration than the calcium of the rations and the mineral supplement. They came to the conclusion that calcium meta- bolism was characterized by its rapid loss from the body during early period of lactation and its reten- tion during the dry period with most rapid storage at the end of the period of gestation. At the time of high milk production, if the food was sufficient to maintain the life of the cow, she would produce milk, even though this involved an extensive drain upon the tissues of her body. Hart et al. [1922-23] took up the work again and found phosphorus equi- librium was maintained without, and calcium equilibrium with, bone-meal and green grass supple- ment. The cows of the Sahiwal herd at our dairy farm were reported to be licking earth while grazing. As the cows were fed with protein-rich concentrates, green fodder and mineral mixture as 'Churn Flour' this habit of theirs could not be explained. The earth was analysed, but nothing particular was discovered, which could account for this peculiar habit and it was suspected that probably more calcium and phosphorus were excreted by our cows than they were ingesting from the feeds. The present investigation was undertaken to ascertain if there was variation in the percentage ratio and total output of calcium and phosphorus in relation to the yield of milk, age and stage of lactation in the case of the Sahiwal breed of cows and if so to what extent. The above factors in relation to dry and green fodder were also examined. EXPERIMENTAL Preliminary experiments were carried out to study the suitability of methods of analysis and to ascer- tain (i) whether there was any variation in the per- centage of calcium and phosphorus in the different milkings of the day and whether these differed from that found in a composite sample of the day's milk, (ii) whether the total amount of calcium and phosphorus in all four milkings differed from that calculated from the composite sample, (iii) whether the ratio CaO : P2O5 was constant, and (iv) whether there was any change in the percentage of calcium and phosphorus in the day-to-day milk. For this purpose, three high and three low milk- ing cows, first calver, second calver and adult, all in the same stages of lactation (8th week), were selected. Samples of milk were taken from all the four milkings and composite samples of the milk was prepared by taking 5 c.c. per lb. The milk was ashed by Neumann's method [1902- 03] which was found quite satisfactory. Ten c.c. milk was taken out with a pipette in a 100 c.c. Kjeldahl flask. A separate aliquot of 10 c.c. was weighed in a tared weighing bottle. For calcula- tion, the average weight of 10 c.c. of milk was used, as the difference in day-to-day weight was not very much. But before calving 10 c.c. of milk was weighed separately each day. The milk was ashed with 5 c.c. concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid and the solution made up to 100 c.c. Twenty-five c.c. aliquot was taken and calcium esti- mated by Kraut's method [1856]. Ten c.c. aliquot was taken and phosphorus estimated by Pemberton's method [1882]. These preliminary experiments revealed that (1) the percentage of these elements in samples of the different milkings of the day did not vary much among themselves or from the composite sample of the day, (2) the percentage of these elements in day-to-day samples of the milk did not differ much and (3) the ratio of CaO : P2O3 also did not show much variation. For comprehensive studies, 12 high-milking and 12 low-milking cows of different ages and in the various stages of lactation were selected. The lactation of some of these cows commenced before they calved. Samples of milk were taken once a day at 9 a.m. milking and analysed. The concentrates as well as green and fresh fodders were also analysed for calcium and phosphorus, the latter at an interval of ten days. One pound of mustard cake per cow was also given from 1 to 10 August and half a pound of boiled linseed per cow was given to those which were in the first 100 days of lactation. In addition to these concentrates, the cows were taking 20 lb. of green fodder (cowpeas and jowar mixture), three pounds of berseem hay and three pounds of bhusa. While grazing, they could take about 20 pounds of grass. The grains, oil cakes, berseem hay and bhusa were analysed for calcium and phosphorus. The results are given in Table IV. D 2

In the case of 'Felbir' (first calver), the percentage of calcium was low in the premilk and it tended to increase up to the time of calving. The tendency to increase continued for about a week after calving and then it remained constant. On the other hand, the percentage of phosphorus was very high in the premilk and the tendency was to fall immediately after calving ; the decrease continued for about a week or two and then it tended to remain stable. The percentage of calcium in- creased from 0.165 to 0.187 in four weeks time whereas the percentage of phosphorus fell from 0.33 to 0.225. The ratio in the premilk was as high as 1 : 2.0 ; when the percentage of calcium and phosphorus tended to remain constant after calving, the ratio was 1 : 1.2. The yield of premilk was from 4.5 to 16 pounds per day. In case of second calver, 'Narajkhati', the exami- nation of milk was started from the very first day of taking out the premilk. In the beginning the yield was half a pound only, but later rose to 8 pounds per day before calving. The percentage of calcium was very low in the beginning and tended to increase as the time of calving approached ; it continued to increase gradually for a week or two and tended to remain constant. On the other hand the percentage of phosphorus was high in the begin- ning, increased and reached the highest two days before calving and then decreased. The decrease continued for about two weeks and then a tendency towards stability appeared. The percentage of cal- cium increased from 0.054 to 0.191 in four weeks; whereas the percentage of phosphorus rose from 0.186 to 0.321 before calving, then falling gradually reached 0.225.

MATHUR 209 in the premilk was as high as 1 : 3.64 and, when the percentage of calcium and phosphorus appeared to remain constant after calving, the ratio was 1:1.18. It was interesting to note that the highest ratio of CaO : P2O5 was found on the very first or second day of premilk. As 'Felbir' was already giving premilk, the highest ratio was not observed as in the case of 'Narajkhati.' This explained the dis- similarity in the curves of the graphs of the two cows in the first few days. If the part of the curves of Narajkhati's graph for the first few days is not considered, the curves in those of the two premilkers are similar. The high ratio of the salts in 'Naraj- khati's' milk indicated more secretive power. Two high milkers and five medium and low milkers in the first, second and third hundred days of lacta- tion were selected. In 'Tashkam' with a yield of 31 pounds per day the percentage of calcium and phosphorus was low as compared to the others. In the individual cows, there was not much variation in the percentages of calcium and phosphorus in the course of four weeks. In all the first calvers the composition of each cow's milk was different from that of the other. In the third 100 days of lactation, when the yield was low and the cow was completing lactation, the milk was generally richer in mineral contents. It was of interest to note that in 'Taroochi' and 'Folgai' with the same yield (22 pounds) and in the same stage of lactation, the percentage of calcium and the phosphorus was the same. Four high milkers and three medium and low milkers in the first and second 100 days of lactation were available. In all the cows except diseased ones, there was not much variation in the percent- ages of calcium and phosphorus in the course of four weeks. The composition of the milk of the different cows varied. In 'Rajudhina' the calcium and phosphorus percentage was rather high for some time when she was suffering from foot-and-mouth disease. It decreased as the cow came to normal health. In some cases, with the decrease in yield in the later part of lactation, the calcium percentage increased. Four high and four low milkers in the first, second and third 100 days of lactation were selected. 'Raj- lari' also was affected with foot-and-mouth disease and this accounted for the high amount of calcium and phosphorus in the milk for some time. The percentage of calcium and phosphorus fell later on when the cow was normal. A comparison of the data of two cows 'Rajsam' and 'Lakroochi' in the first 100 days and second 100 days of lactation (in Table IX) revealed that: (1) During the flush (peak) period when the yield reached the maximum, the percentages of calcium and phosphorus were appreciably lower than those at a later period when the yield fell by 12-16 pounds; (2) The ratio of calcium to phosphorus was practi- cally the same; and (3) The total amount of calcium and phosphorus output in the milk per day also fell with the yield. There were chances of positive balances being main- tained and storage if the rations were not much reduced.

ChorengGOBIND SINGH THAPAR AND BIPIN BIHARI SINGHA 219 SUMMARY The percentages of calcium and phosphorus in the different milkings of a particular day in a cow showed no variation. There was practically no variation in the per- centages of calcium and phosphorus in the course of four weeks except in the premilkers or those cows which reached or passed the peak period. When the cow was in the peak period the per- centages of calcium and phosphorus in the milk decreased and when that period passed, the per- centages of these elements in the milk increased. When the yield was below 10 pounds, in the last days of lactation, the percentage of CaO and P2O5 increased. In the premilk the percentage of phosphorus was very high and that of calcium very low, so much so that the ratio of CaO : P2O5 attained a value as high as 1 : 3.64 in the beginning. The percentage of calcium in the premilk gradually increased and continued to do so till a week or two after calving when the tendency towards stabiliza- tion appeared. On the other hand, the percentage of phosphorus increased for some time, reached the maximum before calving and then decreased. It continued to do so for a week or so after calving and then the tendency towards stabilization appeared. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus was different in individual cows.

After washing in the usual way they were placed in ½ per cent solution of sodium thiosulphate (hypo) which was allowed to react on the specimens for ½ to 1 hour. The material was then thoroughly washed in water and cleared in glycerine. The lymph vessels took a beautiful yellow tinge and could be clearly traced through the specimens. Acetic alum carmine and Ehrlich's acid hæma- toxylin gave good results for the whole mounts and sections. Olveria indica N.G., N.SP. The worms are flat and slightly elongated, measuring 6.14-7.07 mm. in length and 2.35-3.35 mm. in greatest breadth. They are widest in the middle and gradually taper towards the anterior end. The posterior end is, however, rounded. There are cuticular papillæ present in the region of the mouth and the genital sucker. The cuticle is inturned both at the mouth and the genital opening and shows cuticular papillæ in these regions. It is produced into small ridges (denticles) at the mouth and is continued into the entire length of the muscular portion of the Indian J. vet.

The uterus arises from the öotype and runs towards the anterior end of body making a few coils which are full of eggs. The course of the uterus anteriorly is S-shaped, it crosses over from one side of the body to the other and again to the same side as in Gastrothylax. Near its termination it becomes slightly muscular and forms the metraterm. The genital pore is situated at a distance of 1.42 mm. from the anterior end of the body and is surrounded by a well-developed genital sucker. The eggs are oval and operculated, measuring 0.068-0.085 mm. by 0.075-0.119 mm. in size. The vitelline glands are well developed and consist of large follicles situated laterally on either side of the body, extending from a little in front of the genital sucker to a little in front of the posterior sucker. The transverse vitelline duct of each side leaves the glands in front of the acetabulum and runs inwards to meet each other behind the ovary. From this point a common vitelline duct takes its origin and runs forwards to the öotype. Male Reproductive Organs. There are two testes situated slightly diagonally one behind the other in the posterior half of the body, a little in front of the ovary. They are more or less rounded with slightly lobed margins. The anterior testis lies at a distance of 2.95 mm. from the anterior end of the body and measures 1.2 mm. by 0.95 mm. in size. The posterior testis lies 0.17 mm. behind the anterior testis and measures 1.33 mm. by 1.14 mm. The vasa deferentia from the two testes unite together a little in front of the anterior testis and form a much coiled tube, the vesicula seminalis which leads into a cirrus 0.57 mm. by 0.22 mm. in size. The cirrus is enclosed within a thin-walled cirrus-sac, containing numerous prostate gland cells, and open at the genital pore beside the opening of the metraterm.

In the Central Provinces and Berar, goats are found to be very heavily infected with Trematodes in Nagpur and the percentage of in- fected animals is greatest in winter season from December to February. Amphistome infection is the highest in all seasons and in winter as many as 76 per cent of animals are infected with them. Coty- lophoron cotylophorum and Gastrothylax crumenifer are the commonest amphistomes. Fasciola hepatica and species of Schistosoma are not very common and the incidence of infection is also low. In Central India, the only trematodes found are species of Schistosoma and that too only in 16 per cent animals. Amphistomes are conspicuous by their absence. In the. Central Provinces and Berar, species of Aviteleina and Stilesia occur very commonly. In Central India Stilesia vittata is very common but the percentage of infected animals is only 24. Hæmonchus contortus is found in the Central Provinces and Berar in about 73 per cent of animals in the rainy season but the percentage falls to 33 in summer and the average infection also falls down from 75 to 31 per animal. Trichocephalus ovis also occurs in a large number of animals but the infection is not heavy. In Central India, Trichocephalus ovis is more abundant occurring in as many as 81 per cent animals. Bunostomum trigonocephalum is also more common than in the Central Provinces and Berar. Sheep. In the Central Provinces and Berar, sheep are more, heavily infected at Raipur than at other places. Cotylophoron cotylophorum is the most common parasite occurring in Central Provinces in 51 per cent of sheep with an average load of 984 per infected animal. Species of Schistosoma and Fasciola hepatica are more abundant in sheep than in goats. But it is interesting to note that Cotylo- phoron cotylophorum is more abundant in the rainy season than in winter. In Central India, the only two trematodes infecting sheep are Cotylophoron ovatum and species of Schistosoma; but the infection is low; only 16 per cent of animals are infected. Commonly the same cestodes which infect goat also infect the sheep. In the Central Provinces and Berar, Stilesia globipunctata occurs in about 17 per cent of the animals showing heavy infection. In Central India, the cestode infection is slightly more than the trematode infection. Trichocephalus ovis and Hæmonchus contortus are the commonest Nematodes in sheep in Central Pro- vinces. Bunoslomum trigonocephalum and Gaigeria pachyscelis occur in 32 per cent and 16 per cent animals respectively but the degree of infection is low. Gongylonema pulchrum and G. verrucosum occur less frequently in sheep than in goats. In Central India, nematode infection is low and less varied. The only common nematodes are Hæmon- chus Contortus and Trichocephalus ovis. Cattle. In Central Provinces and Berar, Raipur is the most heavily infected area ; as many as 75 per cent of cattle are infected with Cotylophoron cotylophorum, and at Nagpur 72 per cent are infected with this parasite. Gastrothylax crumenifer is found in 88 per cent cattle at Raipur and in 54 per cent cattle at Nagpur. The infection by Paramphisto- mum cervi is also heavy in Raipur but not so heavy as in Nagpur. The cattle in Central India are less heavily infected. Only 30 per cent of them har- boured Paramphistomum Cervi, cotylophoron cotylo- phorum and Fasciola hepatica. The cestode infection in cattle in the Central Provinces and Berar is confined only to Moniezia expansa and M. benedini and cysts of Echinococcus granulosus. The cattle at Mhow are also infected by these cysts. The nematode infection in cattle in the Central Provinces and Berar is fairly varied but the inci- dence is low except for Bunostomum trigonocephalum which occurs in 43 per cent of animals. In Central India Mecistocirrus digitatus is found in 50 per cent cattle and Gongylonema pulchrum and COMPOSITION OF VANASPATI (HYDROGENATED EDIBLE FATS) AND MARGARINE MANUFACTURED IN INDIA By B. VASUDEVA RAO and C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 29 February 1944) THE establishment of hydrogenated oil factories broughout India during the past decade and the rapid development of this industry that has taken place in recent years has greatly contributed to the increase in the production of edible fats and also their preservation and consumption in a better state. Even though large quantities of vanaspati are manufactured in India from several vegetable oils and are being sold in the Indian market under various brands, no data regarding the composition of vanaspati as a commercial product seem to have appeared in the literature which would give an idea of the usual ranges of analytical values in the different samples. The present investigation was undertaken and analyses of the various brands of vanaspati available in India have been made with the above object in view. EXPERIMENTAL Vanaspati samples were obtained from the various manufacturers in. different parts of India through the courtesy of The Vanaspati Manufacturers' Association of India. Most of the values were determined by the standard methods of fat analysis as described by the A. O. A. C. Iodine value was determined by the pyridine sul- phate method and butyro-refractometer reading was taken at 40°C. Vitamin A. was estimated in the unsaponifiable matter by the Carr-Price reaction, In all 26 vanaspati samples have been analysed and except for the Lion Brand (G), prepared by the Indian Vegetable Products, Limited, as a special product from coconut oil, they are all available in the market for the general public. In addition to vanaspati, Blue Brand margarine, manufactured as a substitute for butter has also been included in the investigation. The results of these analyses are presented in Table I.

Trace 7 232 Composition of Vanaspati (Hydrogenated Edible Fats) and Margarine It will be seen from Table I that the butyro-refrac- tometer reading in all cases ranges from 48.1 to 52.6 with the exception of Lion Brand vanaspati (G) which gives a very low figure of 34.6, and Blue Brand margarine, which gives a reading of 39.9. Except for the last two samples, the range obtained is much above the figures for genuine butterfat (40.0-43.5). The saponification value ranges from 188.5 to 194.8 with the exception of three samples, viz. Swastik Brand vanaspati Lion Brand vanaspati (G) and Blue Brand margarine, which give rather high figures of 203.7, 257.4 and 45.6 respectively. The last two figures are very much above the values obtainable for pure ghee. Iodine value ranges from 45.6 to 68.8 with the exception of Lion Brand vanaspati (G) and Blue Brand margarine which give values of 1.0 and 22.6 respectively. It is rather striking that the Lion Brand vanaspati (G) gives such an exceedingly low value which is no doubt due to a higher degree of hydrogenation and also to the fact that it is made from coconut oil of low iodine value. For almost all the samples, the R. M. value varies from 0.0 to 0.85. But Lion Brand vanaspati (G) gives a divergent figure of 8.05 and Blue Brand margarine 6.60. Polenske value ranges from 0.0 to 0.85 in all the cases except Lion Brand, vanaspati Blue Brand margarine (G) which give very high figure of 15.24 and 9.77 respectively. Krishchner value is zero for all samples with the exception of the last. two. It was also observed that none of the samples examined gave even a trace of colourto the unsaponifiable matter with the Carr-Price reagent thus indicating absence of Vitamin A. Nor could any traces of nickel be detected by the dimethylglyoxime test. In chemical analysis fats are generally characteriz- ed by the determination of certain analytical con- stants by standard methods. However, since oils and fats are natural products, these values are subject to variations. The existence of a wide range of values in the case of certain constants in fats admits of their easy adulteration with other fats without detection. The Avelallemant process is considered to be a valuable auxiliary to the Reinchert-Meissl value in deciding whether butter fat is adulterated or not, and is based on the relative solubilities in water of the barium salts of the fatty acids. The total barium value (A) of a fat is the equivalent of the saponification number expressed as barium oxide. The insoluble barium value (B) is that portion of the total barium value which represents the equivalent as barium oxide of the insoluble barium salts from 1 gm. of fat. In other words, it is the amount of soluble barium salt (as barium oxide ) to be added to the potash soap from 1 gm. of fat necessary to precipitate completely the in- soluble barium soap. The soluble barium vali is (A-B), which is equal to say C, from which calculated the value of BB. VASUDEVA RAO AND C. P.

(MADRAS), Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry), Hyderabad-Deccan (Received for publication on 23 November 1944) TUBERCULOSIS in fowls is an insidious chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis avium. But this disease has been regarded as being of very rare occurrence in ducks and geese. Feldman [1938] states that the disease is uncommon in water fowls, and ducks even when living in intimate contact with tuberculous fowls. Eber [1925] found one case of tuberculosis among 460 ducks but failed to find the disease among 412 geese and 15 swans which he examined at necropsy. Klimmer [1930] over a period of 22 years examined 181 ducks and 145 geese and found tuberculosis in one per cent of the former and 1.4 per cent in the latter. Lænkholm as quoted by Zeller [1932] observed only one case of tuberculosis among 135 geese and 131 ducks. Picard [1927] from the Dutch East Indies reported this disease in one goose and two fowls. Tubercu- losis in fowls has been recorded from various parts of India but the extent of the losses caused by the disease is not yet known [Iyer, 1943]. There is no published record available to show the incidence of tuberculosis in ducks in India. The object of this brief note is to record a case of tuberculosis in a goose. This is the first case of its kind encountered in Hyderabad State. It occurred in a flock of 13 geese and 17, ducks which were kept in captivity at the Zoological Public Gardens, Hyderabad-Dn. About 30 to 40 fowls were also in close contact with them. Later on, all contracted Ranikhet disease but 14 survived. Report of the sudden death of a goose was received by the writer when he was engaged in attending an outbreak of Ranikhet disease in the same gardens. POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION It was an old bird showing marked emaciation. Extensive generalized tuberculosis involving most of the organs in the body was observed. To illustrate the macroscopic appearances of the infected organs the following notes are given :JOHN FFRANCIS 235 Avian tuberculin 0.1 c.c. was injected into the web of the feet in the geese and ducks but none reacted positively to this test. This method of testing in ducks and geese according to Craig and Davies [1937] is of no practical value in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Dobson and others [1941] conclude that the tuberculin test carried out intradermally in the skin of the neck and in the cloaca and in conjunctiva with synthetic avian tuberculin was of no value in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in ducks.

Sc., M.R.C.V.S. (Reprinted from The Journal of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, Vol. 14, No. 1, November 1942) READING the older veterinary authors e.g. Smith, [1897]; Law, [1902], Friedberger and Fröhner, [1908], one is struck by the scope and accuracy of their clinical and pathological observations. A vast amount of research, particularly in Germany and France, has been carried out on the respiratory diseases of the horse, but most of it was done before the days of motor transport; that is, before the methods of research into the ætiology of bacterial and virus diseases had been perfected, and as this group of diseases is particularly difficult to study it is not surprising that the subject is still some- what confused. However, after having paid some attention to the question of predisposing causes and secondary bacterial invasion, an attempt will be made to assess the evidence that there are four respiratory diseases of the horse each primarily due to a specific virus infection. It is far from easy to show experimentally that, adverse environmental conditions will cause the onset of pneumonia, but all clinical observers appear to agree that they are of great importance in preci- pitating attacks of equine respiratory diseases. In a very fine clinical article on ' Pneumonia and Pleurisy in the Horse,' the late Sir Frederick Smith [1897] quotes Hunting as saying that ' want of condition, plus fast work, causes exhaustion, and then we only want cold, changeable weather to produce diseases of the lungs.' Smith believed ex- haustion to be a ' direct exciting ' cause of pneumonia, especially in young, soft horses, whereas older horses seem to possess a comparative immunity against some of the ' causes or conditions ' which so freely contribute to the production of the disease in the young. Smith realized that the febrile attacks from which nearly all young horses suffer when first brought into stables may be associated with the process of acquiring immunity to the ' pneumonia microbe.' Pneumonia chiefly affects stabled horses and the great importance of good hygienic conditions is shown by the fact that five years after the introduction of ' sanitary science ' into the French Army the annual incidence of pneu- monia had dropped from 110 to 46 per thousand horses, and four years later to little more than 3½ per thousand. Long rail and sea journeys also predispose to pneumonia. Coleman (Principal of the Royal Veterinary College, 1794-1839) laid great emphasis on the importance of well-ventilated stables, but unfortunately he did not display equally good judgement on many other subjects. In parentheses, it may be said that the clinical methods of examining the chest and the ' respiratory sounds,' described by Smith will be of great interest
236 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse to all clinicians working with large domestic animals. He found the phonendoscope to be by far the best instrument as an aid to diagnosis, and the extreme care with which he conducted his examinations can be judged from the fact that they were carried out at night with sawdust as bedding to ' insure quietude.' The best types of modern stethoscopes have been described in the Lancet [1941]. Koch [cit. M' Fadyean, 1938] found that normal horses harboured diplo-streptococci (see later) in the nasal passages. Boyer [1919], in an examination of the nose and mouth of normal horses, found that 8 per cent were carriers of ' Bact. Viscosus ' and 12 per cent of ' Str. pyogenes ' and ' Pseud.pyocyanea ' respectively. Hignett [1940] isolated group 'C' streptococci from the nasal cávity of normal horses. There can be little doubt that one or other of a number of bacterial species may be present in the nasopharynx and produce disease when host resistance is lowered. Sporadic cases of pneumonia, nasal catarrh or strangles probably arise in this way, but severe outbreaks usually occur only when large numbers of young horses, or horses which have not previously been exposed to infection, are brought to remount depots or sales yards. The infectious nature of these outbreaks is probably due to a virus and, although the uncomplicated disease usually produces immunity, all observers agree that in itself it is very mild and may pass unnoticed. The severity of the symptoms and the mortality probably depend, therefore, on the virulence of the secondary organisms and above all on the care which is taken of the horses as soon as the first rise of temperature occurs. This was fully realized by Fitzwygram [ 1894 ], who showed that the ' incipient attack ' could be most readily detected by the use of a clinical thermometer. The Royal Army Veterinary Corps made use of this fact during the last war, and as a result the losses from respiratory diseases were greatly reduced [ Edwards, 1935b ]. It will be seen from the foregoing summary that outbreaks of disease caused by any one virus may differ greatly in their severity and also in the clinical symptoms presented, and this is probably why there is confusion regarding the clinical classifica- tion of equine respiratory diseases ; a confusion which was not apparently diminished by the experience of the last war. At that time, however, knowledge of human respiratory diseases was in no better state, and in 1918-19 influenza killed ten to twenty million people [ Geddes-Smith, 1941 ]. On the other hand, it is well known that human ' influenza ' may be a very mild disease, and the only satisfactory method of classification is on an ætiological basis. Con- siderable progress has already been made in this direction [ Francis, T., 1941]. Our knowledge of equine respiratory diseases will probably only become clarified when they can be classified on an ætiological basis, and it can be definitely ascertained that a given outbreak of disease is due to a certain ' virus', EQUNIE INFLUENZA (Pink eye, influenza catarrhalis, typhoid fever, pferdestaupe) ' Malignant epidemics ' which occurred about, 1815 and the stringent methods which were employed to control them have been described by Youatt [ 1831]. Three out of five horses which were attacked died. and the clinical symptoms indicate that the disease was a severe form of equine influenza. He also describes equine influenza as it existed in this country during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Law [ 1902 ] has described in great detail the epizootic which paralyzed horse transport in the U.S.A. in 1872-73. Williams [1924] discussed other early epidemics and also described a severe outbreak in India in which the mortality in most groups of horses varied from 1 to 10 per cent but was occasionally as high as 20 per cent. Equine influenza caused serious inconvenience and loss during the last war [ Todd and Soutar 1938; Udall, 1938; Anon., 1941 ], and it is still fairly prevalent in India. Equine influenza and contagious penumonia were confused by the early workers. The confusion that existed in the Army veterinary services was described by M' Fadyean [ 1889 ]. The two diseases had, however, been' clearly differentiated by Falke, 1862 [ see Friedberger and Fröhner, 1908]. The position was again confused by the work of Ligniers [see Nocard and Leclainche, 1903 ], who claimed that both diseases were primarily due to pasteurella organisms. Bemelmans [ 1921 ] also distinguished clearly between the two diseases, but emphasized that equine contagious pneumonia closely resembled human influenza. This similarity has also been described by Edwards [ 1935a]. It is felt, however, that no change should be made in the nomenclature of the equine diseases. The clinical manifestations of influenza vary considerably, and detailed descriptions have been given by Law [ 1902 ], Friedberger and Fröhner [1908]. A characteristic feature is the marked prostration, and muscular and cardiac weakness during the early febrile stage. The temperature curve is much more erratic than in equine pneumonia. There is usually a harsh cough, the muccus mem- brances are reddened and there may be some nasal discharge. The conjunctiva assumes a deep red to mahogany colour, the eyelids are usually swollen and JOHN FRANCIS 237 long railway journeys the mortality may be 100 per cent. It would appear that the influenza virus can attack any of the body tissues ; there is always intestinal inflamation, and Friedberger and Fröhner [1908] state that the principal changes are in the organs of digestion. Apart from the virulence of the virus the type of disease depends on environmental conditions, management and on the species of the bacterial invaders. Research work on the ætiology of influenza has been reviewed by Edwards [1935a] and by Todd and Souter [1938]. It is a highly infectious virus disease and may be set up by the subcutaneous inoculation of infected blood [this fact has been confirmed by Dale and Dollahite, 1939 ] or by direct or indirect contact. Saliva may be infective for at least eight months after recovery and it has been reported that a stallion transmitted infection by coitus for a period of six years. One attack of the disease confers a long-lasting immunity, but animals remain susceptible to equine contagious pneumonia. Little attention has been paid to the problem of secondary bacterial invasion in equine influenza. It is probable, however, that in the pneumonic form streptococci and perhaps also staphylococcr invade the lungs, whilst the good results obtained by Marshal and Lee [ cit. Udall, 1938] following the use of pasteurella biological products suggest that this organism may also be of pathological importance. Krag and Tiedge [1938] isolated S. enteritidis, Bact. viscosum equi and C. diphtheria from the organs of horses affected with ' malignant strangles. ' and it is possible that these organi ms are of importance in the intestinal form of equine influenza. EQUINE CONTAGIOUS PNEUMONIA (Influenza pectoralis. contagious pleuropneumonia, brustseuche.) The long incubation period (up to thirty days), irregular spread, lack of subcutaneous swellings or marked depressions during the early febrile stage and the regular temperature curve are said to differentiate this disease from equine influenza. There is often a yellowish discharge from the nose which is pathognomonic a dry, nusky cough may be heard. Friedberger and Fröhner [1908] and Bemelmans [1921 ] both state that there is intestinal inflamation,. but manifest symptoms of intestinal disease are rare. Following the fall of the primary fever and particularly if the animal is worked, varying degrees of pneumonia and pleurisy may develop. The mortality may be as high as 20 per cent., and for many years the disease has caused serious losses amongst Army horses; the period of the last war was no exception [Udall, 1938 ]. The research work which established the ætiology of this disease has been reviewed by Edwards [ 1935a ] and again by M'Fadyean [1938]. The disease has two causes which act separately and are respon- sible for different stages in the illness and different lesions... The virus is the veritable cause in the sense that it is responsible for the spread of the disease..., Law [ 1902 ] noted that neither Schütz nor Lignières had shown the experimental diseases produced by them, following the inoculation of bacteria, to be contagious and therefore did not accept their claim to have discovered the true, cause of pneumonia or influenza. Gaffky and Lührs [ 1910-12, cit. Edwards, 1935a] showed that this disease was caused by a. virus which could only be found in the lungs and at an early stage of the disease. After the primary rise of temperature the virus disappears from the lungs and the horse may recover without any very obvious signs of the disease. On the other hand, particularly if the horse is worked, bacteria may invade the lungs and a secondary rise in temperature with typical pneumonia will occur. It will be seen that this work anticipated the researches on human influenza by many years, and this was probably the first respiratory disease in which a ' dual causation ' was discovered. Infection can only be transmitted by direct contact or by rubbing lung tissue from a horse in the early stages of the disease on to the nasal or buccal mucosa, and even then the incubation period may be as long as 39 days. This may explain why the disease has been considered to be non-infectious by some clinical observers, including Smith [ 1897 ], although the course of the disease as described by him suggests that he was dealing with brustseuche. Fraser [ 1938 ] has des- cribed what was probably an outbreak of this disease and states that streptococcal vaccines were valuable in reducing mortality. The experiments of Lührs [1928, cit. Edwards, 1935a] showed that animals which had received virulent lung tissue subcutaneously were resistant to infection by intranasal or intrabuccal rubbing of infective bronchial mucus which almost invariably produced disease in control animals. The question of secondary bacterial invasion is somewhat confused. M'Fadyean [ 1938] assumed that the organisms isolated by Schütz [ 1887 ] and used in his attempts to produce brustseuche were typical streptococci. This appears to be incorrect for an examination of the original article shows that the organism was a gram-negative bacterium which often occurred in pair and was usually encapsulated. Friedberger and Fröhner [ 1908] also state that the ' diplo-bacteria' of Schütz are gram-negative. It can be concluded with reasonable certainty that these were not pasteurella organisms. Nocard and Leclainche [ 1903 ] say that although the organism was originally described as gram-negative, it is now known to be gram-positive. This cannot be accepted, however, because his article on strangles [ Schütz, 1888] makes it quite clear that he was I
238 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse already ( 1887 ) perfectly familiar with the strepto- cocci. Ostertag [1908, cit. Mitscherlich, 1941] also isolated gram-negative ' diplo-streptococci' from the lungs of horses affected with brustseuche. It can be concluded from the work of Mitscherlich [ 1941 ], which will be discussed later, that there is a gram-negative diplo-streptococcus which is patho- genic for the horse and which in some ways resembles a true streptococcus. It grows best in a medium containing blood- or serum. On blood agar plates dry pin-point colonies surrounded by hæmolytic zones are produced, and a, flocculent deposit, leaving a clear supernatant, fluid, is formed in 1 per cent, serum broth. Continued cultivation is difficult and cultures usually die out. It is not pathogenic for guinea-pigs, but usually kills mice in from one to five days, and necrotic fecci were sometimes observed in the liver. It would appear that this organism has several points of resemblance to the Neisseria group of organisms, which includes the meningo- coccus and gonococcus, as described by Topley and Wilson [ 1936 ]. Despite the foregoing discussion, streptococci were the ultimate cause of the pneumonia in the series of cases reported by M'Fadyean [ 1938], and recent work in this country and abroad has clearly demonstrated the important part played by group ' C' streptococci in respiratory and other diseases of the horse. Lignière's conclusions that pastenrella organisms were the primary cause of equine contagious pneumonia has already been mentioned. Webb [ 1909 ] isolated pure cultures of pastenrella organisms from the lungs of horses and donkeys dying from pneumonia, but the clinical history of the outbreaks suggests that the virus of contagious, equine pneumonia was the primary ætiological agent. The extensive researches of Bemelmans [ 1921 ] indicate that, whilst pasteurella organisms may be isolated from cases of infectious pneumonia, diplo- streptococci, staphylococci or pseudo-pyocyanca are found more frequently. It appears that under varying conditions of time and place any of the above organisms may complicate the virus infection of contagious pneumonia. It is therefore not surprising that there was great con- fusion at a time when bacterial classification had not been standardized, and in the early accounts it is difficult to decide with any certainty which organism is actually being described. INFECSTIOUS CATARRH (Equine infectious bronchitis, epizootic laryngetracheites, epizootic cough, Hoppegarte cough, Brussels disease, skalma) Waldmann and Köbe [ 1936 ] described a highly infectious virus disease characterized clinically by a dry, strong cough as its chief symptom, and pathologically by lesions of bronchitis and peri- bronchitis. In horses kept under good conditions the disease usually ran its course as a pure virus infection, but when the preliminary symptoms were overlooked, and animals were not specially cared for, serious complications, such as broncho-pneu- monia and pleurisy, occurred, due to invasion of the lungs by streptococci, sometimes followed by death. Horses were infected by the intranasal inoculation of lung filtrates and the disease was also transmitted to pigs and cattle. Recovered animals showed at, least a partial immunity. Oprescu [ 1938 ] des- cribed a similar disease which could be trans- mitted by the subcutaneous inoculation of blood. It is probable that infectious catarrh is similar to the condition known to the older German writers as skalma, and apparently various types of the condition are now prevalent amongst German army horses. Mitscherlich [ 1941 ] studied an outbreak affecting 176 out of 240 horses. He states that this disease can be differentiated from : (1) Strangles by the presence of purulent nasal catarrh and the infrequency of lymph-node swellings and abscess formation. (2) Brustseuche: in this disease there is a longer incubation period, a more prolonged fever and usually a red-brown nasal discharge and dull areas in the lungs. At autopsy there is a serious effusion and a thick fibrinous deposit on the pleura which is not seen in respiratory catarrh. (3) Influenza, in which there is a marked morning recession of the fever, swelling of the conjunctiva, JOHN FRANCIS 239 Beller and Traub [ 1941 ] have made a careful study of respiratory catarrh and in general their findings agreed with those of Waldmann and Köbe [ 1936 ]; they were, however, unable to transmit the disease to cattle, ferrets, white mice or pigs, or to propagate it in tissue culture. Bazely and Battle [ 1940 ] have described a disease which rapidly reached epidemic proportion when numbers of horses were brought into close contact for more than ten days. Various forms of the disease were observed, but they were grouped under the general term ' respiratory catarrh'. The authors apparently believed the disease to be due to group ' C' hæmolytic streptococci, but horses that had passed through an epidemic were immune to subsequent exposure, and it is quite possible that the condition was similar to the disease described by Waldmann and Köbe and was primarily due to virus infection. Walker [1935] has described a highly infectious epidemic of coughing amongst horses in Great Britain. Pulles [ 1941 ] and Rexroth [ 1941 ] state that the intravenous injection of ' Thoromangan,' an iodine- thorium-manganese compound, is valuable in the treatment of infectious catarrh. STRANGLES The incidence and severity of strangles vary in different parts of the world. It is a serious disease in the remount depots in India. Arnold [ 1931 ] has described the disease in that country and the methods of prophylaxis and treatment which are employed. Following a primary inflammation of the upper respiratory tract an inflammation of the sub- maxillary Iymph-nedes develops which is not neces- sarily followed by abscess formation. Pus taken during the earliest stages of the disease contains no micro-organism. Wooldridge [ 1936 ] mentions that a virus may be the primary cause of strangles, but- most writers appear to accept the view that it is caused by Str. equi. Bazely and Battle [ 1940 ] say : ' We have found no suggestion of a virus in this disease, and, judging from the regularity by which Str. equi occurs, none appears to be needed for an adequate ætiology '. The fact that Str. equi but not the other types of group ' C' streptococci usually associated with equine disease, can nearly always be isolated from unruptured matured abscesses lends support to this view, but the conclusion that Str. equi is the sole cause of strangles cannot easily be accepted on pidemiological grounds. It is well known that strangles is a disease of young horses and a life-long immunity is usually produced. It is notoriously difficult to produce community against streptococci and success has not een attained by the use of streptococcal vaccines to prevent strangles [ Edwards, 1935 ]. The highly infectious nature of the disease and the fact that a strong immunity is usually established suggest that it is primarily caused by a virus. Bazely and Battle state that their work was ' conducted in a laboratory which for the past two and a half years had. concerned itself exclusively with the study of hæmolytic strepto- cocci, ' and we can only conclude that no attempt was made to isolate a virus. Clinical observation and experiments led Arnold [ 1933 ] to conclude that strangles is primarily due to a virus which produces febrile reactions only; a secondary invasion by streptococci produces all the recognized manifestations of the disease. The virus is responsible for the high infectivity and a benign uncomplicated virus infection is sometimes observed. On the other hand, sporadic cases may be due to bacteria only. The virus disease can be produced by the intra-tracheal inoculation of filtered strangles pus and this leaves the animal solidly immune to subsequent infection. A formalized filtrate produced only slight immunity. Van Dorssen [1939 ] concluded that ' benign strangles' was caused solely by Str. equi Richters [1935] isolated true diphtheria bacilli from the unopened lymph-nodes and nasal discharge of some horses affected with malignant strangles ; injections of these organisms into susceptible horses produced in- flammation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and severe gastro-enteritis. He concludes, however, that neither these organisms nor streptococci are the primary cause of strangles, but that it is due to a specific virus. It has not been possible to find any subsequent publication of Richters' substantiating this view, but Beller and Traub [ 1941 ] and Rexroth [ 1941 ] reached the same conclusion. Law [ 1902 ] noted that, although horses inoculated with strangles streptococci developed abscesses, there was no evidence that the disease produced was contagious, but taken as a whole the evidence suggesting that a virus is the primary ætiological agent in this disease is not perhaps so strong as in those already described. It has already been mentioned that Krage and Tiedge [ 1938] isolated S. enteritides, Bact. viscosum equi and C. diptheria from the organs of horses affected with malignant strangles. LESIONS IN NERVOUS AND OTHER TISSUES The conditions described in this review are usually accepted as being respiratory diseases, but one cannot help remarking that the primary virus infection often exhibits all the features of a generalized disease. There may be marked impairment of kidney and liver function, and the predilection of the influenza virus for the intestine is well known. Traub [ 1941 ] and Rexroth [ 1941 ] noted pustular and exanthema- tous lesions during the course of infectious catarrh, and in an exhaustive clinical study Steffan [ 1941 ] K
240 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse demonstrated partial or complete auricular-ventri- cular heart block. The nervous and psychic disturbances which may occur during the course of respiratory diseases have been noted by most authors. Bemelmans [ 1921 ] attributed many of the primary disease symptoms to nervous derangement, and Steffan [ 1941 ] has made a special study of the subject. There can be little doubt that there is a relationship between the neural damage caused and the subse- quent onset of roaring, stringhalt and the other nervous affections of the horse. Ebberbeck's [ 1940 ] pathological investigations have provided much evidence in support of this view, but it is probable that nutrition [ Mitchell, 1936 ] and heriditary disposition also play their part. DISCUSSION The four respiratory diseases have been described as though they were separate entities, and some of their main features are summarized in Table I, but it must be admitted that, whilst the typical diseases can be recognized, there are many outbreaks which even experienced workers are unable to classify [ Theiler, 1918 ]. TABLE I JOHN FRANCIS 241 knowledge on the subject'. Pillers and others (1934) also discussed the difficulty of differentiating strangles from the various catarrhal affections of horses. Beller and Traub [ 1941 ] noted that strangles and infectious catarrh might occur together in the same horse and after a very careful study put forward the interesting suggestion that they are both primarily due to the same virus and that the different symptoms are due to different secondary invaders or predisposition of the horse. Rexroth [ 1941 ] as a result of clinical and pathological investigations, supported this view. Lührs [ 1933 ], whilst admitting that no one can mistake true epidemic equine influenza, states that there are many outbreaks of disease which one cannot easily classify, and Law [ 1902 ], who was obviously familiar with the epidemic disease, says that in the slighter cases the lesions are often confined to the anterior part of the respiratory organs which are congested and red, the lesions may extend to the bronchi. In human medicine there are similar differences between epidemic and sporadic influenza, and, although in some outbreaks influenza ' A ' or 'B' virus can be identified, in other clinically identical outbreaks no virus can be isolated. It would appear that, whilst the main clinical entities242 ABSTRACTS Bemelmans, E. (1932). " Comparison of Human Influenza, Equine Contagious Pneumonia and Canine Distemper ". Ergebm. Allg. Path.

" Influenza of the HorseABSTRACTS 243 The occurrence of hæmolytic cocco-bacilli in the nose of normal sheep and cattle. T. J. BOSWORTH, AND B. LOVELL (1944). J. Comp. Path. 54, 168. GRAM-NEGATIVE hæmolytic cocco-bacilli have been recovered from pneumonic conditions in sheep and cattle, both in Great Britain and America. The authors recovered similar organisms from the noses of 26 of 51 ewes examined by them in a flock of 199, half of which were affected with nasal catarrh following a spell of cold weather. As the significance of these findings was difficult to assess, the examination was extended to include a number of healthy sheep and cattle. Accordingly, they swabbed the noses of 100 normal healthy sheep, 50 from each of two flocks, and the lower portion of the trachea of 84 sheep shortly after slaughter. They also took swabs from the nose of a total of 113 cows and calves in three different herds. The swabs were rubbed on five per cent ox-blood agar plates, and after 24 to 48 hours incubation, suspicious colonies were picked and examined. The results are given in the table below, which also includes those from the examination of the 51 sheep affected with nasal catarrh. Number and species of animal State of health Site of swab Number or isolations 51 sheep Nasal catarrh Nose 26 50 sheep Healthy Nose 26 50 sheep Healthy Nose 14 84 sheep Healthy at p.m. Lower portion of trachea 7 6 cattle Healthy Nose 0 49 cattle Healthy Nose 6 50 cattle Healthy Nose 3 Omitting the sheep which were suffering from nasal catarrh hæmolytic cocco-bacilli were recovered from the nose of 40 of 100 healthy sheep and from the trachea of 7 of 84. The number of cattle from which hæmolytic cocco-bacilli were isolated was much smaller, only 9 out of 105 (113 ?). From this it appears that cocco-bacilli of this class are com- monly present in the nasal passages of sheep and to a less extent in those of cattle. Their recovery from pneumonic and other respiratory affections in sheep and cattle should not, therefore, be taken to mean that they are responsible per se for such conditions. It is more probable that their role is only secondary to some primary factor which may be either a virus, as suggested by some, or change in environ- ment. The characteristics of these organisms were as follows :244 ABSTRACTS The dose recommended is 2 gm. of an oily emulsion, intra- muscularly, at an interval of a week. More than two courses are rarely necessary. As many as 8 gm. have been given to patients without toxicity. The emulsion is prepared by triturating the finely-powdered drug in a sterile mortar with 0.35 gm. of adeps lanæ and about 15 c.c. of olive oil, previously sterilized by heating at 150°C. for one hour. Five c.c. of sterile water is then added and the emulsion is produced. A further 20 c.c. of olive oil is then added and the emulsion is poured into previously sterilized two-ounce medicine bottles and sealed. Sterilization should be completed by heating the bottles in an autoclave at 115°C. for 30 minutes. One injection of 2 c.c. of 3 per cent 'novutox' should be given on the upper part of the worm sinus and two similar injections below it. This should be followed by an injection of 20 c.c. of the phenothiazine emulsion in the upper part of the worm sinus and two injections of 10 c.c. each below it, along the tract of the previous injections of 'novutox.' The emulsion of phenothiazine should not be allowed to cool down much, otherwise the drug will precipitate. The most important part of the whole treatment is to see that half of the emulsion is injected as near the course of the buried worm as possible. Both local and general concentration of the drug is very important. [G.D.B.] Cryptococcus infection in equidae. S. C. J. BENNETT (1944). J. roy. Army. Vety. Corps 16, 108-18 ATTEMPTS have been made by a few workers to create new species classification of Cryptococcus ; the author is, however, of the opinion that there is no justification for this, until more substantial evidence for the creation of new species is forthcoming; and that, until this question is decided, all cryptococci causing suppurative infections in equidæ should be regarded as that of C. farciminosus only. C. farciminosus should be regarded as a pyogenic orga nism liable to be found in any suppurative lesion in any part of the body. Microscopic examination of pus smears is the only sure means of diagnosing the disease and the author advocates more general use of the microscope in diagnosis, even though the lesion in no way resembles the textbook description of the disease. In the absence of such examination, the real nature of the infection is likely to be missed and such cases act as dangerous carriers of the disease. The discharge from recently dressed open wounds may not show the specific organisms. Experimental evidence shows that the incubation period in this disease is shorter than has hitherto been stated : undiagnosed and atypical cases, such as cryptococcal con- junctivitis, represent the ' missing link ', and the writer describes a few cases in his experience in support of this view. A suggestion is made that the policy of slaughtering in- fected animals in enzootic areas should be abandoned and treatment undertaken. A few hints are offered regarding the selection of promising cases for surgical treatment and the importance of hospital hygiene in the control of this disease. [P.R.K.] The utilization of urea in the bovine rumen. 1, 2, 3. R. M. PEARSON, AND J. A. B. SMITH (1943). Biochem. J. 37, 142-64 THE work was undertaken to test the contemporary theory that when urea is fed to ruminants with a suitable diet it is converted to protein in the rumen and is thus digested by the animal. The first article is concerned with the details of the methods adopted for estimating non-protein nitrogen, urea and ammo- nia, with the heterogeneity of the rumen ingesta of a steer and with some preliminary in vivo experiments. Compara- tive study of trichloracetic acid, sodium tungstate with sulphuric acid and alcohol as protein precipitants showed that the alcohol and sodium tungstate methods give similar results, whereas trichloracetic acid gives much higher values. Details of the sodium tungstate method finally adopted are also given. Heterogeneity of the rumen ingesta is described and illustrated by analyses. Determinations of nitrogen distribution values on samples taken at the same time from different positions in the rumen showed a variation between extremes of almost 20 per cent. Sampling difficulties are also described. Determinations of protein and non-protein nitrogen in the rumen ingesta after meals with and without urea showed no significant difference between protein values in the two cases, though there was a change in the non- protein nitrogen fraction. The average results gave no satisfactory evidence for the synthesis of protein from urea, The in vivo programme was abandoned owing to its inherent difficulties. Similar in vivo experiments by Wegner, Booth, Bohsted and Hart are described and discussed. The second article deals with in vitro experiments. Pre- liminary incubation experiments showed that rumen con- tents were able to convert urea to ammonia. So it was thought probable that utilization of urea by ruminants involved the conversion of urea to ammonia at the first stage of the process. A detailed study of this conversion was made. Methods of obtaining the sample of rumen contents and incubation of the rumen liquor are described. Results showed that the rate of conversion of urea to ammonia was much the same with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and air. Carbon dioxide in presence of starch accelerated the rate of conversion slightly. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate had a retarding effect. The rate of conversion was found to increase with increase in temperature till it reached a maximum af 49°C, thereafter it decreased. The urease activity of the rumen liquor was found to be at its maximum between the pH. values 7 and 9. There was a slight increase in the conversion of urea with increased urea concentration, Time of sampling was found immaterial. It is remarked that the urease activity of the rumen ingesta is great at all times of the day, whatever the time of feeding, and remains so little affected by relatively large amounts of urea, that- all the urea over likely to be fed, even to a high yielding cow in full lactation, will readily be converted to ammonia within one hr. The inhibitory effect of sodium fluoride, quinone, cysteine, boric acid and borax on the urease activity of the rumen liquor was also studied. Toluene was found to be without effect. It is pointed out that the urease activity of rumen liquor is similar to urease from jack-bean meal, and that the enzymes from these two very different sources have much in common and may be identical. The third article deals with the conversion of ammonia to protein in the rumen. Here again, incubation of rumen contents was carried out under a variety of different condi- tions and with different substances. The microbiological condition of rumen ingesta was found to remain practically constant during the first 2-4 hr. incubation. During this period of incubation the non-protein nitrogen of the medium diminished while the total nitrogen remained unchanged, suggesting that synthesis of protein took place. Control experiments were carried out with bran and oats, fæces and soil, but no change in the non-protein nitrogen was found during the first three hours of incubation. The amount of synthesis occurring in two hours in the presence of 0.3 gm. starch per 100 gm. rumen liquor was usually equivalent to about 8 mg. nitrogen per 100 gm. rumen liquor. A study of the influence of sodium fluoride, quinone, boric acid, borax, toluene, temperature and the effects of filtration and fractionation by centrifuge on the synthesis of protein re- vealed that, when rumen liquor is incubated with starch and urea at 39°C, the nitrogen metabolism of the system involved both synthetic and hydrolytic processes which probably proceed simultaneously. These processes are mi- crobiological in origin and the equilibrium between them is very readily changed, so that either synthesis or hydrolysis
ABSTRACTS 245 predominates according to the conditions during incuba- tion. The possible bearing of this on the utilization of non- protein nitrogen and on the biological value of the proteins for ruminants is briefly discussed. pH of the rumen ingesta was found to vary from time to time between 6.3 and 7.4. No correlation was found between the pH. during incubation and the amount of protein synthesis, provided the pH lies within the above limits.

Agriculture 50, 242-5 To make the best use of the limited animal feeding stuffs available at the present time and in the immediate post-war period, it is necessary to breed cows with high efficiency in milk production, as the dairy cow is the most economical converter of feeding stuffs into human food. The practical means by which this can be brought about may be divided into: (a) The breeding of dairy bulls which will transmit high milk-producing capacity with a great degree of certainty. This can be achieved by breeding young bulls from progeny- tested bulls only. By using a succession of proven bulls in a herd it is possible to breed bulls which will transmit a high degree of productive capacity. Provided the sire is well bred for milk, bulls for commercial herds can be ob- tained by grading-up cows of high productivity. To over- come the difficulties of breeders in the United Kingdom in rearing all their bull calves to breeding age, it is suggested that either the bull calves should be reared on the War Agricultural Executive Committee's farm (if suitable faci- lities are available) or week-old calves should be supplied to the commercial dairy farmer to rear for himself. (b) The means by which the commercial milk producer can grade up his herd by the use of such bulls. The keeping of heifer calves for rearing from the best cows is a good practice, but it is slow because of the limited number of offspring produced by a cow. A bull will produce on an average 35 calves in a year (and with artificial insemination up to 1,000, given great density of cow population), as com- pared with only one from a cow. Progress can thus be made much more rapidly by concentrating attention on the bull used. Dairy cattle should be bred pure or graded up to a pure breed. The factors to be considered in deciding the pure breed to which a herd should be graded up are : (1) the suitability of the soil, climate and the environment of the holding for a particular breed ; and (2) the purpose for which the breed is kept. The rapidity with which grading up to a high-producing pure breed can be effected is often not fully appreciated. A low producing non-descript herd can in two generations be made into a herd of quite reasonably good production and type by grading up with high-producing, pure-breed bulls. In small herds, artificial insemination from a well-bred dairy bull may perhaps be very convenient and economical. The need is emphasized for the problem of breeding for milk production to be attached on a broad community basis for the common good of dairy farmers. [T. A.S.] The treatment of mastitis by irrigating the udder with a solution of proflavine sulphate combined with the use of a mixed vaccine. H. S. COCKBURN (1942). Vet. Rec. 21, 54 THE author reports that cows tolerate an udder infusion at one in 5,000 or even one in 2,500 proflavine sulphate (as compared with standard one in 10,000 solution of acri- flavin) without any apparent injury to the udder or loss of milk. His report is based on experiments in 39 cows in which 71 quarters which were treated by irrigation in this way (except in 2 cases in which one in 7,500 solution was used). A maximum of three irrigations were given at an interval of about one week and a mixed mastitis vaccine was in most cases given subcutaneously at first and second irrigations in doses of 0.5 and 1.0 c.c. 28 cases showed clini- cal recovery in a period of one to three weeks and of the 71 quarters irrigated 49 resolved, i.e. a recovery rate of 71.8 per cent in cattle and 69 per cent in affected quarters. He concludes that with its foregoing treatment quarter figures are slightly better in comparison with its acrifla- vine combined vaccine method. [W.M.K.] The value of alfalfa and certain of its fractions in the nutrition of breeding ewes IN further study by the Indiana Experiment Station of the deficiencies of the oat straw, corn silage, yellow corn silage, yellow corn, and cane molasses ration for sheep, a nutritive value for growth, maintenance, and milk pro- duction in ewes was demonstrated for dehydrated and field-cured alfalfa hay. All of 14 lots of 15 yearling ewes each received rations of yellow corn, corn silage and corn meal. Average daily supplements were provided in different lots of about 2.5, 1.6, 0.86 and 0.42 lb. (1.2, 0.72, 0.38, 0.19 kg.) of dehydrated alfalfa hay with varying amounts of oat straw meal sufficient to supply necessary roughage. Other lots received field-cured alfalfa meal, concentrated alfalfa juice, residue from fresh alfalfa and ether extract from alfalfa cake, cottonseed meal, commercial casein, or dehydrated oat grass. The energy content of the ration was equalized by variations in the amount of corn fed. The oat straw ration was improved with casein and cotton- seed meal but was not as good as with supplements of alfalfa hay or alfalfa products. A supplement made up of the com- bined fractions of alfalfa press juice, fat solubles from alfalfa hay. and pressed alfalfa cake produced growth in ewes of 30.9 lb. (14 kg.) which was comparable to 38.5 lb. (17.5 kg.) by the lot receiving the largest amount of dehydrated alfalfa. An average gain of 50.9 lb. (23.1 kg.) in the ewes during pregnancy was produced with dehydrated oat grass supple- ment. The weight of milk consumed by the lambs was ascertained by weighing the lambs before and after nursing.

Maternal inheritance in survival of embryos from reciprocal crosses involving the creeper factor RECIPROCAL brother-sister matings between creeper and normal chickens were arranged in order to determine whether creeper-laid eggs hatched less well than normal laid eggs. Owing to the fact that the effect was slight, elaborate pre- cautions were taken against errors. The results showed that there was a significantly larger mortality for creeper- laid eggs in the 18-22 day incubation period, but not earlier. The ratio of creeper-normal chicks hatching was not affected. The explanation given is that, owing to defective endosteal bone trabeculae of the hens caused by the creeper factor, less calcium can be stored, thus causing eggs laid to have too thick or too thin shells.

KRISHNAMURTI, G.M.V.C., Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Serum Institute (Madras), Coimbatore (Received for publication on 24 March 1945) WITH the inauguration of a Serum Institute at Madras, much work has been done to evolve a safe, efficient and cheap method of combating rinderpest in this province. Rinderpest virus, modified by serial passage through goats, was given an extensive trial both at the laboratory and in the field and such modified virus has now been employed for the last ten years.* Saunders and Ayyar [1936] were among the first to put the method of immu- nizing cattle by the goat virus alone method to a critical and controlled test with a view to deter- mine whether successive passages of virus through goats would so alter the virus as to make it safe for use as a vaccine for protecting cattle against the disease without anti-serum. D'Costa [1938] says that goat virus causes a 70 per cent mortality in hill bulls and recommends that highly susceptible animals should be immunized by the sero-virus method, employing ' fixed' goat virus as the in- fective agent and slightly reducing the dose of pro- tective serum; while Bachan Singh [1939] states that the ' fixed ' virus from Mukteswar possesses a low virulence for cattle of indigenous breed and that it has been found to be safe for local-breed buffaloes of Central Provinces and Berar. Workers in other provinces have reported favour- ably on the use of the goat virus alone method in combating rinderpest, but the experience gained in this province goes to show that this method could not be advocated for wide use, as it produces undesirable reactions and other bad effects after inoculation. The object of this paper is to place on record a brief survey of the work done in this province with goat virus and to make a comparative study of rinderpest bull virus and rinderpest goat virus, with a view to find out whether there is any attenuation of the virus when maintained in succes- sive passages through goats. RINDERPEST GOAT VIRUS The goat virus is maintained at the Serum Institute by successive passages in local breed of goats. Two strains of virus, viz. (1) The Madras strain and (2) the Mukteswar strain, were maintained. After running the two strains for over seven years when * Annual Reports. Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, 1932.33 to 1943-44. more than 400 passages of each strain were comp- leted, the two were amalgamated together and maintained as a single strain, Madras strain No. 2, as it was found that there was not much difference in the degree and percentage of reactions set up by them in the control buffalo-calves. In the mean- while a quantity of ' fixed goat virus ' was obtained from Mukteswar and that is also now being main- tained as ' Mukteswar strain No. 2.' The two strains are periodically tested for every tenth passage on young susceptible buffalo-calves of local breed. Most of the goats used for virus production, are invariably bled to death to meet the demand for virus. The control calves are ob- served for reactions and then tested with a dose of virulent bull virus, after the reactions to original inoculation of goat virus, have subsided. So far about 375 passages of the Mukteswar strain No. 2, and 225 passages of Madras strain No. 2 have been completed. One hundred and thirty-nine calves for the Mukteswar strain and forty-two for the Madras strain have been used and the observa- tions on the type of reactions amongst them are summarized below. Mukteswar strain No. 2. Out of the 139 calves, 116 or 83.5 per cent had thermal reactions, 86 or 61.9 per cent had diarrh248 Comparative Study of Rinderpest Bull-Goat-Viruses TABLE I Type of reaction observed among goat virus controlsR. KRISHAMURTI 249 death. Those that recovered after diarrh250 Comparative Study of Rinderpest Bull-Goat-Viruses 0.1 per cent among the inoculated were reported to have died as a result of the severe reactions set up by this method and the mortality had occurred mostly among buffaloes, which class of animals was found to be less resistant to the effects of this method of inoculation. During 1936-37 out of 62,905 animals inoculated with goat virus, 54 ani- mals, mostly buffaloes, were reported to have died as a result of severe reactions set up. Though the percentage of mortality was negligible, the seve- rity of reactions set up in many cases could not be ignored though it was possible that such severity was due to an unusually high susceptibility of such reactors. The method proved to be unpopular among the ryots owing to the severe reactions set up, especially in buffaloes, and owing to a large per- centage of animals becoming incapacitated for work for some time after inoculation. The possibility of setting up fresh foci of infection in healthy centres by this method had also to be considered. TISSUE VIRUS Exhaustive trials with infected goat spleen tissue were also carried out with a view to study the adap- tability of this technique in this province and the results obtained have been published [Nair, Krishna- murti and Kalyanasundaram, 1941, 1942]. The adoption of the method of inoculation with tissue emulsion in normal saline was not found to be quite safe in this province, as the reactions set up after vaccination were rather severe. In the case of the desiccated vaccine, it was found to have set up severe reactions in some places and it could not be said to be a safe product. It is the general experience that the administra- tion of goat virus, either blood virus or tissue virus, which produces a reliable immunity, is attended with a considerable amount of risk and that a certain proportion of animals so inoculated, especially buffaloes, develop a severe reaction and in some cases mortality also occurs. As this method of protec- tion with goat virus alone could not be carried out with safety, serum simultaneous inoculations is now being done using goat blood virus as the infective agent and reducing the quantity of pro- tective serum. The serum given is just sufficient to ward off any undesirable reactions. Table IV shows the number of such serum simultaneous inoculations performed so far in this province and the mortality noted amongst them.

R. KRISHNAMURTI 251 The strain was obtained from one of the districts of this province, where the disease was prevailing. Bull virus was largely used for some years for con- ducting serum simultaneous inoculations but, now with the advent of goat virus, the former is mostly employed for carrying out immunity tests. NATURE OF REACTION OBERVED An analysis of observations recorded for five years from 1938-39, leaving out of account the year 1942-43 when no bull virus strain could be main- tained, is given in a tabular statement Table V). From the statement it may be observed that during the year 1938-39, 133 buffalo-calves were used for virus production; of these, though 130 calves had thermal reactions, only 102 were bled for virus, is the remaining 28 had not the satisfactory thermal rise to allow bleeding.

Two strains of goat virus, the Mukteswar strain and the Madras strain, are maintained at the Serum Institute, Madras, and there is not much difference in the nature and percentage of reactions set up by them in the control calves. It was found both from experiments conducted in the laboratory and in the field that the method of protecting cattle against rinderpest by the goat virus alone was not quite a safe one. The reactions set up by this method in the control calves were severe resulting in a mortality of 21.5 per cent amongst them. In the field, though the percentage of mortality was negligible, the severity of reactions set up by this method, especially in buffaloes, was such that it became unpopular among the ryots who could ill-afford to have some of their animals incapacitated for work and their milk yield reduced even for a short period. The spleen tissue emulsion in normal saline solu- tion also behaved in the same manner as the blood virus ; hence it could not also be advocated for use without anti-serum. From experience gained in this province it may be said that the ideal attenuation of the virus for use as such without anti-serum, in bovines, cannot be said to have been obtained by successive pas- sages through goats. The percentage of mortality among goat virus control calves was observed to be much less, less than even half of that which occurred among the calves used for the production of bull virus, though appreciable difference was not noticed in the degree and nature of other reactions.

GOPALAKRISHNAN, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam (Received for publication on 24 April 1945) RINDERPEST in buffaloes is of common occurrence in Assam and heavy mortality is often observed. The technique of goat virus vaccination, with or without serum, has been adopted for the control of outbreaks. The object of this paper is to present a brief description of certain features observed in the course of immunization of the local types of buffaloes and those in different localities of the province. It may be stated that vaccination with goat tissue virus (1 c.c. of 1 : 200 spleen emulsion in saline), has been adopted as a routine, both as a prophylactic and for control of outbreaks in cattle and this method has given very encouraging results for some years now. In regard to buffaloes, immunization is usually undertaken in actual outbreaks of rinderpest and not as a prophylactic measure. This is mainly lue to the fact that there is evidence of a wide ange in the degree of reaction in the local types of buffaloes and also in buffaloes in different areas. A. standard routine for vaccination of buffaloes could not be fixed as the dosage of serum is variable and has to be regulated in accordance with these two factors. Field observations indicate that the reaction is more severe in buffaloes than in cattle. As a result of such severe reaction, partial reduc- tion or complete cessation of milk yield and diarrh254 Immunization of Buffaloes against Rinderpest in Assam in milk yield, in some cases even by one-half.

The reaction mani- fested in several cases is mild with slight decrease in milk yield; a few develop diarrhF. W. PRIESTLEY AND D. ARTIOLI 255 anxiety to the owner and the operator alike. The most satisfactory method appears to be the use of adequate quantity of serum which inhibits severe reaction and thus causes a minimum loss in milk yield. Such loss is inevitable as inoculation, operation or even any physical interference with the buffaloes affects these temperamentally and usually reduces their milk-yield for one or two days. It may, however, be mentioned in this con- nection that in the Central Provinces and Berar the method of blood virus-cum-serum was experi- mentally found to be the safest; the loss in milk yield being lowest, viz. 25 per cent [Singh, 1939]. Fall in condition or general health has also been observed following vaccination in the field. Although severe reaction is likely to bring about this condi- tion, the absence of green fodder aggravates it. It would be preferable as far as possible to undertake vaccination as far as at a time when there is ample green fodder. SUMMARY A brief description of the types of buffaloes in Assam and their distribution in different localities, is given. Rinderpest is of common occurrence in Assam, causing heavy mortality among buffaloes. Details are given of the field experiments conducted to evolve the most suitable method of immunization of buffaloes against the disease in the province. Particulars of the type and degree of reaction in the methods adopted to control the disease are described. There is evidence of a wide variation in the degree of reaction in the local types of buffaloes and also in buffaloes in different areas, viz. plains, hills and forests. Vaccination with goat-tissue virus, along with 30 to 40 c.c. of serum, appears to be the safest method, as it obviates to a large extent the risk of mortality and loss in milk yield.

W. PRIESTLEY and D. ARTIOLI, Military Veterinary Laboratory, Lahore (Received for publication on 27 March 1945) IT has been generally assumed locally that mastitis in buffaloes is of little importance. Since relatively slight experience convinced us that this view was incorrect, work on the problem was begun with the results outlined below. It was soon realized that the examination of several hundred milk samples by a plating technique was beyond the capacity of this laboratory. It was therefore decided to adopt the incubated milk technique described fully by van Rensburgh [1941] and since reported with some favour by Rowlands and Field [1943] and by Field and Smith [1944]. Briefly, this technique consists of incubating mixed quarter samples of milk from each animal at 37°C. and examining stained smears for the presence of streptococci 18 to 24 hours later. No attempt has been made here to compare the van Rensburgh technique with any other, but it is worth mentioning that, when occasion has demanded the isolation of mastitis streptococci, these organisms have invariably been isolated from van Rensburgh positive samples. Our work is recorded under the three headings, general epidemiology, vaccination and eradication. GENERAL EPIDEMIOLOGY Bacteriology The vast majority of infected buffaloes examined by us have been infected with streptococci and this work has been concerned entirely with that type of organism. The number of samples containing staphylococci has been relatively low, although a certain number of clinical cases have been associated with Staph, aureus. The number of C. pyogenes cases has been even lower, though this organism too has been isolated occasionally. No case of tuberculous mastitis in buffaloes has been met with, but serious search for this organism has not been made. We have not carried out serological tests in this laboratory on mastitis streptococci but, judging by the biochemical reactions, they would nearly always fall into Lancefield's group B, as might be expected. These local strains give ß-haemolysis in horse-blood agar, a final pH in glucose-broth of about 4.3 after four days incubation, hydrolyse sodium hippurate, fail to reduce 1 in 5000 methylene blue in milk, produce acid in lactose and trehalose, B
256 Streptococcus Mastitis in Buffaloes sometimes in salicin, but not as a rule in mannitol or sorbitol. General incidence Before any policy concerning mastitis could be suggested, it was necessary to be convinced that the disease was in fact widespread and of importance. Between May and October, 1944, a preliminary survey was therefore undertaken on three different farms; during the same period, another laboratory working in cooperation with us undertook the examination of two more farms.* The results are recorded in Table I from which it may. be seen that the incidence of infection varied from 13.1 to 18.5 per cent, and that of the total number of 3,322 animals examined 16.0 per cent were infected. Since the original survey, other examinations have been carried out on some of these farms and the results have confirmed the finding of a fairly high incidence of infection. The indications were therefore that streptococcus mastitis was fairly widespread and it was to be assumed that it was the cause of considerable economic loss. TABLE I Incidence of streptococcus mastitis in buffaloes in Lahore area. Farm No. Number examined Positive 1 511 93 (18.2 per cent) 2 1006 168 (16.7 per cent) 3 625 90 (14.4 per cent) 4 694 91 (13.1 per cent) 5 486 90 (18.5 per cent) TOTAL 3322 532 (16.0 per cent) Possible intermittency of excretion of streptococci The original estimate of approximately 16.0 per cent infection was based on the results of one test only. A point of considerable importance however in dealing with this disease is the fact that there is in buffaloes an apparent intermittency of excretion of streptococci. This is shown in Table II. Of the 730 animals examined, twice, with an interval of about three months between tests, 122 were positive at the first test and of these only 60 (49.2 per cent) were positive at the second test. Similarly of the 608 negative at the first test 106 were positive at the second. TABLE II Apparent intermittency of excretion of streptococci at consecutive tests F. W. PRIESTLEY AND D. ARTIOLI 257 Association of mastitis with period of lactation It has been suggested that the early stages of lactation, constitute the period of greatest suscepti- bility to mastitis in cattle. Our results indicate a similar finding in buffaloes, though our numbers were too small to be statistically significant. It may be briefly stated that at all ages up to 10 years there was a greater incidence of mastitis during the first hundred days of lactation than at later stages. Summarizing the data it was found that of the 479 animals examined during the first hundred days of lactation 161 per cent were infected, and of the 302 examined during the second hundred days 10.9 per cent were infected. Milk yields of infected and non-infected buffaloes It is accepted that cows give a reduced milk yield when they become infected with mastitis strep- tococci but very few workers have actually demons- trated this with figures. Minett and Martin [1936] studied by statistical methods the relationship of milk yield to infection by Br. abortus and Str. agalactice. In the case of the latter they found that with Ayrshire cows in one herd the corrected yield was reduced by 10.8 per cent, with Friesian cows in two herds the percentage reductions in corrected yields amounted to 16.5 and 19.5. We obtained milk yield data for a small number of buffaloes seven years old. and over. The animals were examined for mastitis streptococci in October 1944, and again in January 1945. The yields for October, November and December, 1944, were tabulated according to the age of the animals and the stage of lactation at the time of the first test. Only animals which were negative at both tests or positive at both tests were included. The results indicated that the yield, as would be expected, increased as lactation advanced, at any rate up to 200 days. TABLE IV Average milk yield (in lb.) over three months of infected and non-infected 7-11 years old buffaloes Buffaloes Period of lactation (in days) during which the first test was carried out 1-50 51-100 101-150 151-200 Non infected . . 1586 2090 2371 2989 (89) (58) (51) (30) Infected . . . 1151 2059 1197 926 (21) (15) (11) (4) Figures in brackets represent numbers of animals from which averages have been calculated. In Table IV are summarized the results for 7 to 11 years old animals; figures for animals over 11 years old are not included since there were so few of them available. From the table it may be seen that among non-infected animals the average total milk yield in lb. for the three months increased from 1,586 in early lactation to 2,989 later; among infected animals, at least after they had been in lactation over 100 days, there was a decrease in milk yield, which might have been brought about by progressive induration of the udder. Again, it is to be noted that at all stages of lactation the infected animals have given less milk than non-infected animals. We think that these results, perhaps inconclusive by themselves, lend support to the general belief that mastitis infection leads to a lowering of milk yield. Vaccination In September 1944, there was an opportunity to carry out a controlled vaccination experiment. While we did not expect vaccination to be beneficial, the opportunity seemed too good to miss and experi- mental work was therefore commenced. Vaccine was prepared from five strains of streptococci isolated from buffaloes in the herd concerned. All strains gave 258 Streptococcus Mastitis in Buffaloes The total weekly yield in lb. for each of the animals is shown in Table V. It may be seen that the total yield of the ten animals for the week pre- ceding vaccination was 699 lb., for the week follow- ing the first inoculation 680 lb., and for the week after the second inoculation 732 lb. From these results it was concluded that vaccination would have no appreciable effect on milk yield.

The vaccinated animals received two doses of vaccine subcutaneously at an interval of seven days. The first dose con- sisted of 5.0 c.c. suspension standardized to No. 1 of the Wellcome Opacity Tubes and the second of 5.0 c.c. suspension ten times as dense, i.e. the doses were half those used in the initial test of the vaccine. A day or two prior to vaccination milk samples from all animals were examined for streptococci. Approximately four months after vaccination milk samples were again examined. The results are recorded in Table VI from which it may be seen that nine (17.3 per cent) of the vaccinated animals and eight (12.7 per cent) of the controls had become infected. The difference of 4.6 per cent in favour of the controls is not statistically significant since it is only 0.7 times its standard deviation. It may safely be concluded therefore that vaccina- tion had been without effect as a means of preventing streptococcal mastitis.

ARTIOLI 259 September 1944, the three remaining sheds ontained 100, 100 and 97 animals; the initial umbers of infected animals were 27, 13 and 17 espectively as judged by a single milk examination. the last shed the 17 infected animals were moved one end; they were milked and attended by two walas, one incharge of 13 infected animals and he other incharge of the remaining four infected ogether with nine clean animals. In the first two heds no movement of animals took place, and they ere in fact regarded as controls. In view of the fact hat vaccination of animals in the other three sheds ad no effect, these animals may also be regarded as ontrols. In other words, in September 1944, here was one shed with infected animals at one nd and five sheds with infected animals distributed hroughout the length of the buildings. The rrangements on this farm were not very satis- actory and cooperation was only half-hearted. No milk examinations were carried out on animals ntering the herd, hence infection had every chance if being introduced. Four months later all animals were again examined ad the results assessed. Of the 221 originally non- fected control animals, 39. or 17.6 per cent had come infected; of the 32 originally non-infected nimals in the partially eradicated shed, five or 5.6 per cent had become infected. The difference 12.0 per cent is clearly not significant. It seems from this small experiment that in- complete methods of eradication cannot be expected to cope successfully with the spread of mastitis. Complete eradication Farm 3 contained 11 sheds of milking buffaloes. In October 1944, when a complete examination of the whole herd was carried out, the original distribution of animals was as shown in Table VIII. Thus shed 1 had 57 animals of which nine were infected, shed 2 had 57 animals of which five were infected and so on. On this farm the management was very much more cooperative and experimental conditions were more favourable. A day or so after the first test it was decided to eradicate all infected and doubtful animals from sheds 3, 4, 5 and 8 and replace them with negative animals from other sheds. These four sheds were selected because they were in a position on the farm where drainage and passage of milkers was away from and not through them. The actual transfer was carried out as follows: from shed 3, four doubtful and seven infected animals were removed to shed 10 and replaced by 11 negative animals from shed 10; from shed 4, one doubtful and five infected animals were removed to shed 10 and replaced by six negative animals from this shed; from shed 5, seven doubtful and five positive animals were removed to shed 11 and replaced by 12 negative animals from shed 11; and from shed 8, three doubtful and nine infected animals were removed to shed 11 and replaced by 12 negative animals from this shed. The distribu- tion after this move is shown in Table VIII. TABLE VIII Effect of eradication on the distribution of mastitis in buffaloes Shed No. Original distribution Distribution after first test in October 1944 Distribution in January 1945 260 Streptococcus Mastitis in Buffaloes From this time onwards for the next three months milk samples were examined from all animals prior to their entry into the milking herd. Only animals with negative milk samples were allowed into the four eradication sheds. In this way it was hoped to exclude infection. Owing to the assumed inter- mittency of excretion of streptococci it was con- sidered inevitable that a few infected animals would slip through, especially as only one test was carried out prior to entry into the herd, and this a day or two after calving. Actually, owing to an adminis- trative error, one known infected animal was admit- ted to shed 8 about one month before the completion of the experiment. In January 1945, the whole herd was again examined with the results shown in Table VIII. From this table it is clear that after three months the eradication sheds had considerably fewer infect- ed animals than the control sheds; thus in the eradication sheds there were 185 animals of which 25 or 13.3 per cent were infected, whereas among the. 364 controls 122 or 33.5 per cent of the animals were infected. In view of the fact that sheds 9, 10 and 11 were repositories for infected animals the comparison of the eradication sheds with the grand total of the controls is perhaps not a fair one. However if only sheds 1, 2, 6 and 7 of the controls are considered there will still be found to be a 10 per cent difference, since among the 209 animals in these sheds 49 or 23.4 per cent were infected. TABLE IX Spread of mastitis among originally negative buffaloes Shed No. Numbers of negative animals in October 1944 Number of positive in January 1945 Percentage positive in January 1945 1 43 8 10.2 2 19 1 6 36 1 7 39 4 9 42 13 36.8 10 29 14 11 24 8 3 26 3 9.8 4 25 3 5 46 3 8 26 3 If the observations are confined to animals nega- tive at the first test which remained in the herd for the whole period of three months, i.e. excluding all new entries, an idea of the actual spread of mastitis under different conditions will be obtained. In Table IX we give the results of the examination of the 355 animals concerned. In sheds 1, 2, 6 and 7 among 137 originally negative animals there were 14 or roughly 10 per cent new infections within the three months; similarly in sheds 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the 123 originally negative animals about 10 per cent became infected. The removal of infected animals had not therefore appreciably effected the normal spread of the disease. In sheds 9, 10 and 11 where the initial infection rate was much higher (over 30 per cent) and a constant supply of infection was maintained, the spread to negative animals was much more pronounced; of the 95 originally negative animals 35 or 36.8 per cent became infected. DISCUSSION The data presented in this paper suggest that streptococcus infection of the buffalo udder is a good deal more prevalent than is generally suspected. It would seem that infection is spread primarily by the milkers. It is the practice here for one gawala to attend to and milk about twelve or thirteen animals. When infection appears, it arises in groups of animals standing in adjacent standings; as a rule these foci of infection are within a particular gawala's domain and do not overlap to the next one. A factor which may be of prime importance in treating or eliminating mastitis is the intermittency of excretion of streptococci; this is perhaps especial- ly the case in buffaloes. It is clear that a single test of the van Rensburgh type will not be sufficient to pick out all infected animals. Referring to Table II, for instance, it may be seen that of the 561 animals negative at the second test, 62 (11.0 per cent) were in fact known to be infected from the result of a previous test. This is a serious difficulty and its only solution at the moment lies in repeated examinations of negative animals. In spite of the many difficulties our results tend to show that mastitis control in buffaloes is a practical and probably an economic proposition. By rela- tively simple methods, we have managed to limit the spread of the disease for the short period that the animals were under our control. Had repeated tests been carried out on the. negative animals, we could presumably have reduced the incidence of the disease still more. In view of the present and likely future position of the buffalo as a milk-producing animal in this country, the most important feature brought out by the work recorded here is the simplicity of the technique described as a means of diagnosing strep- tococcus infection. In this country, at any rate

BANERJEE 261 uring the summer months, given a few slides and supply of Newman's stain diagnosis can be made y anyone proficient in the use of a microscope. yen if trained microscopists are not available, the ifficulties will not be overwhelming. One of the ifficulties in dealing with mastitis in the past has cen the lack of laboratory facilities. Milk samples caching a laboratory from any great distance aturally arrive in a putrid state due to overgrowth contaminating organisms, unless steps are taken prevent this. The deep blood agar plating chniqne has been a failure under such conditions. ow, with the incubated milk technique available, e solution is obvious. Samples can be collected sterile tubes and incubated near their source; the summer months in the greater part of India cubation will be unnecessary, as samples can be ft standing at room temperature for the requisite me. After 18 to 24 hours smears can be made nd forwarded to a laboratory when and as con- enient; or if necessary a few drops of formalin or ther preservative can be added to the milk samples nd the whole tube sent for examination; any reptococei present would by then have grown out nd would remain unaffected by the preservative hile the preservative itself will prevent any further rowth of outside contaminants. This technique not only simple but quick; as an example, it ay be noted that in this laboratory on one occasion wo workers prepared, starned and examined 561 nears in one day (under eight hours); incidentally II the smears were examined by one man. If nears are already prepared and sent for diagnosis ne small laboratory can therefore quite easily deal ith several thousand specimens a week. We feel that this is an important observation hich needs emphasis, particularly in areas from hich laboratory facilities are distant. If any astitis control has been considered in the past, he policy adopted or suggested must have been fluenced by the then great practical difficulty of iagnosis. This difficulty has now been removed nd the policy can be modified accordingly. SUMMARY Examination of 3,322 milk buffaloes on five ifferent farms by the technique of incubated milk samples revealed an average of 16.0 per cent strepto coccus infection. 2. Infected buffaloes apparently excrete strepto cocci intermittently. As many as 50 per cent known infected animals may be negative at a given test 3. Additional evidence is brought in favour of the general belief that the incidence of mastitis increases with the age of the animal, and that the early period of lactation is the period of greates susceptibility. 4. Some evidence is adduced in favour of the belief that non-infected animals give a higher milk yield than do infected ones. 5. In our hands vaccination as a means of pre- venting or of curing the disease has been quite without effect. 6. Eradication by the removal of infected animals is indicated as a practical proposition. To be successful strict adherence to commonsense principles must be enforced; any relaxation of these principles is likely to lead to disaster. 7. It has been noted that the spread of the disease is materially affected by the number of infected animals present, at least when these are above a certain minimum. 8. The simplicity of the technique described by van Rensburgh and its possible role in a nationa policy of mastitis eradication are emphasized. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We wish to express our thanks to Mr A. R.

It was thought profitable to make a rather more extended study than the previous workers and take into account a few at least of the numerous factors that complicate any examination of a physiological product like ghee. The practical aim was to see if it was possible to detect easily the adulteration of ghee with foreign fats. For this reason, the test was kept qualitative only. A Hanovia,K. T. ACHAYA AND B. N.

Cholesterol has a blue fluorescence; and crystals of plant phytosterol when examined showed a light purple colour. Finally, the results of the examination of ghee itself are given in Table VI and discussed. The first suggestion is that the colour range is wide and erratic. However, it is seen that (1) no fresh ghee gives any tint of blue, (2) old and very white ghee gives a blue shade and (3) a yellow colour in ghee reveals itself as a yellow colour in fluorescent light. The observations on carotene come to mind. It seems as if carotene masks the true colour of the ghee, and that its removal might yield better information. Some of the above samples of ghee were therefore bleached with 10 per cent of animal charcoal for 20 seconds and filtered. Also a petrol-ether solution of carotene (extracted from dried carrots) was added drop by drop to these bleached samples till the colours matched the C TABLE V Unsaponifiable matter from ghee and oils Sample Colour by day light Colour by ultra- violet light Sindhi cow ghee, rather old Yellow oily globul- es Bright bluish violet Murrah buffalo ghee, three years old Pale yellow viscous liquid Blue with green tinge Dacca ghee, June, 1942 Yellow slimy li- quid Bluish yellow Porbunder buff- alo ghee, Feb- ruary, 1942 Colourless oil Bright purple Fresh buffalo ghee Yellow oily drops Bright bluish purple Ghee prepared from soured cream White milky liquid Bright blue Groundnut hard- ened oil Pale yellow oil Bright bluish purple Cocoanut hard- ened oil do. . do.

They indicate that the age of a sample is revealed in a progressive blue colour, often masked by the yellow colour of carotene. For example, the very white Porbunder Sample 4 (Table VII) gave the same colour even after bleaching; and the green tints of samples 3, 5 and 6 may be explained as resulting from the blue as a consequence of ageing together with the slight residual yellow of carotene. The following results (Table VIII) in every case confirm the deductions stated above, and indicate that a fresh fat should give a greenish-white shade on bleaching.

Old and rancid ghee gives progressively blue shades: most adulterants of ghee also fluoresce blue. Therefore any suggestion of a blue tint in. a bleached ghee indicates either bad quality or adulteration.

S. THAKRE AND K. C. SEN.Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 17 September 1945) IT is now recognized that in hygienic supply of milk from rural areas to urban population refri- gerated system of transport occupies a most promi- nent position. Unfortunately under present con- ditions, this involves high initial cost as well as high recurring expenditure. Since the chief cause of spoilage of milk is bacterial contamination, it is desirable to find out if other methods of treat- ment such as heating the milk to the pasteurizing temperature, which destroys a major portion of the organisms, coupled with its transportation in a hot condition would be successful in preventing the spoilage. The idea is not a new one as Bern- stein [1893] claimed good results in the. transport of hot milk at 70ºC. between Hamburg and Berlin, a railway journey of 10 hours. On the other hand, Ayers and Johnson [1923] reviewed the position and came to the conclusion that milk could not be kept in a good condition for 24 hours at a tem- perature of 50°-60°C. because of the growth of ther- mophilic bacteria. No record of similar work carried out in India under controlled conditions is available, but it is reported that it is a common practice adopt- ed by some Military Dairy Farms to issue hot milk (145ºF.) to customers during summer months.* The milk handled in this way is probably consumed in a few hours' time. Another method, practised by the halvais, specially in northern India, is to keep the milk simmering for 7-8 hours and then dispose it of as demanded by the customers. In this method, there is no doubt that considerable chemical changes are brought about. * Report on the marketing of milk, 1943 As the. 'holding' method of pasteurization, in which milk is heated to 145ºF. and held at that temperature for half an hour, is considered to be suitable for destroying most of the organisms, it is probable that if this heated milk is kept at more or less the same temperature, the stability of the milk will be prolonged for a sufficiently long period, so that it can be transported over long distances without giving rise to undesirable chemical changes, If this is so, much of the expenditure on refrigeration could be avoided and the cost of transport is likely to be reduced. In order to obtain some definite information on the subject, systematic experi- ments have been started in these laboratories and in the present communication, some results on the keeping quality of farm-produced milk at elevated temperature as compared to milk heated to 150ºF. and retained at that temperature for half an hour, cooled and then stored at low (48º-50ºF.) temperature, are given. EXPERIMENTAL Experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale and then some trials were made on a large scale. The experimental work was divided as follows :266 Studies in the Transport of Milk in Warm Condition (iii) Storage of processed milk at room temperature (80°-90°F.) and low temperature (48º-50ºF:) for 20 hours in small aluminium cans. (iv) Storage of processed milk in bulk at a fluc- tuating storage temperature (130°-150°F.) for eight hours in large tinned steel milk cans. PLAN OF WORK Required quantities of raw, mixed milk as detailed under different sections were collected and heated to 150ºF. and retained at that temperature for 30 minutes in a specially constructed milk pasteur- izing can, provided with a stirrer, a tight-fitting lid and an arrangement for inserting the thermometer to record the temperature of the milk without opening the lid. This can was inserted in a bigger vessel containing water which was directly put over a charcoal fire. The milk while being heated was stirred at five minutes intervals to attain uniform temperature. After the process of heating and retaining the milk at the temperature was comple- ted, it was immediately distributed in containers, which were previously sterilized. After filling the containers, they were closed with tight-fitting lids. Those samples which were to be maintained at an elevated temperature were at once transferred to a hot chamber maintained at 150°F. and the sam- ples were immediately cooled down to between 48º-50ºF. by immersing the containers in cold brine solution and then transferred to cold storage (48º-50ºF.). Section I Eight pounds of milk were taken, heated, re- tained at the temperature and then distributed in glass milk bottles as detailed above. These were stored at 150ºF. and 48º-50ºF. for the total period of eight hours. Section II In this section the experimental treatment to the milk was the same as described above, the modi- fications being (i) the use of 12 lb. of milk (ii) the use of aluminium milk cans of 5 lb. capacity as containers and (iii) the storing of milk for a total period of 16 hours, Section III To study the behaviour on processed milk, held at room temperature (80°-90°F.) versus that held in cold storage (48º-50ºF.), this part of the work was done. The modification made was the holding of one lot of milk, after heating and retaining at 150°F. for half an hour, at room temperature while holding the other lot of samples, after cooling, at cold storage temperature (48º-50ºF.). Section IV These trials were made to study the effect of high storage temperature, within a certain fluctuating limit, which may be obtainable under field conditions on a large quantity of milk. Sixty pounds of milk were employed for the trials. The method of heating followed here was slightly different. The whole milk can was immersed in hot water and the milk heated to 150°F. and held at that temperature for half an hour. After com- pletion the can was removed and transferred to an insulated chamber which was heated by a char- coal fire. The inside temperature was not cons- tant but fluctuated between 130° and 150°F. In every case the following chemical, bacterio- logical and physical tests were applied to milk samples, drawn at various stages: Chemical Bacteriological Physical (only applied to milk after hot storage) 1. Fat per cent 1. Total No. of organisms per c.c. of milk 1. Smell 2. Acidity (lactic acid per cent) 2. Presence of B. coli in milk. 3. Methylene blue reduction test 4. Fermentation test 2. Taste. The milk samples were drawn and examined at the following stages: (i) Raw milk (before treatment). (ii) Milk heated to 150°F. and held at that temperature for 30 minutes. (iii) Milk after complete storage period at both the storage temperatures, i.e. 150°F. and 50ºF (iv) Milk samples drawn at three and six hourly intervals in the case of trials under section III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results of the chemical analysis of various samples are given in Table I, while the data on bacterio- logical examination are given in Tables II and III. From the chemical results it will be observed that the fat percentage in milk was not altered by the two different treatments, namely storage at

With regard to acidity there was a slight decrease on heating which may be due to the expulsion of CO2 during the process. The acidity then remained fairly constant in the case of milk stored at high temperature, while in the case of milk in cold storage, there was a very slight decrease. Naturally the milk stored at room tem- perature showed a decided increase in acidity after three hours and still greater increase was noticed after six hours. In fact this milk actually curdled when stored for 20 hours, thus proving that processed milk cannot be stored at ordinary room temperature for more than about six hours. But samples of milk stored at 150°F. and 48°-50°F. for 16 hours showed more or less the same acidity, proving that hot storage at 150°F. is just as efficient as cold storage from this point of view, but it was noticed in the field scale trials that, even if 150°F. storage temperature was not rigidly maintained but allowed to fluctuate between 150°F. and 130°F., there was very little increase in acidity within eight hours of storage. The bacteriological data show that the total number of organisms in raw milk decreased con- siderably on heating. The samples stored at 48° -50°F. at the temperature and retaining the milk for 8, 16, and 20 hours showed that there was neither increase nor decrease in the total count as compared to the total count in milk after heating. The total count of milk stored at 150°F. for 8 and 16 hours showed a decrease when compared to the bacterial count obtained after heating and retaining the milk at the temperature as referred to previously. The same decrease is noticeable in field scale trials. This proves that hot storage from the point of view of growth of surviving organisms after processing the milk, brought about not only in- hibition of growth of the organisms but it did actually destroy them to a certain extent, while the cold storage only inhibited their further multiplication. This appears to show that either the farm milk, which is produced under hygienic condition, did not contain many thermophilic organisms, or even if they were present, they would not affect the storage quality of heated milk at a temperature of 150°F. for at least 16 hours. Storage of the processed milk at the ordinary temperature kept it in good condition only for about four hours. As regards B. coli, raw milk which showed the presence of B. coli in 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 dilutions showed its absence in even 1 ml. of milk just after processing and it continued to remain absent even after storage periods, thus proving that milk once processed, if not recontaminated, would show complete absence of B. coli. The methylene blue reduction time shown by raw milk was considerably increased from about two hours to six hours after processing. In case of milks stored at 150ºF. and 48º-50ºF. for eight hours, the reduction time was more or less the same, while in case of 16 hours' storage, milk stored at 150°F. showed a longer reduction time than the milk stored at 48°-50°F. This observation is further supported by the fact that the total number of organisms in milk stored at 150ºF. after 16 hours showed a greater reduction than the count in milk stored at 48°-50°F. Milk stored at atmospheric tem- perature curdled at the end of a '20 hours' storage period, while that stored at 48°-50°F. at the end of 20 hours showed a total reduction time of 3½ hours. Similar results for methylene blue reduction were noticeable both in case of storage of eight hours at 150°F. in laboratory scale as well as in case of field trials. The fermentation test results showed that in the raw milk curd, there was presence of slight gas and a slight separation of whey. The curd formed after processing and storage periods did not show the above defects and the curd formed was more palatable. A slight cooked odour was observed in all samples stored at 150°F. for different storage periods, while samples stored at 48°-50°F. retained their natural odour. There was practically no appreciable difference in the taste of milk. The effects of storage at an elevated temperature on the mineral and vitamin contents of milk as well as the behaviour of village produced milk under these conditions, are being studied. If these re- sults prove satisfactory and the nutritive quality of milk remains unimpaired, large scale field trials on the transportation of milk at an elevated tem- perature will be made. SUMMARY (1) An investigation has been carried out on the keeping quality of farm-produced milk, processed at a temperature of 150°F. and held at about that temperature for prolonged periods. (2) It has been observed that there is no change either in acidity of milk or fat percentage when the milk is kept in hot condition up to 16 hours. (3) Bacteriological examination shows that there is a definite decrease in the number of organisms when the milk is kept at an elevated termperature as compared to that in cold storage.

THE FATTY ACID COMPONENTS OF INDIAN BUFFALO GHEES By K. T. ACHAYA and B. N. BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 17 September 1945) THE work consists of the analyses by ester-fractiona- tion methods of Indian ghee. In the choice of buffalo ghee for analysis, several factors were considered. Firstly this product is by far the most widely used type of ghee in India. Secondly the literature reveals only three former analyses of buffalo ghee [Bhattacharya and Hilditch, 1931; Heiduschka and Cicekdagi, 1940] of which two were Indian and even these were chosen at random and were not specially characteristic in any way. These three analyses have been quoted later in the course of the discussion. In the choice of typical specimens the basis used was the content of lower fatty acids as reflected in the Reichert-Meissl and Polenske values. The sum of these two values for buffalo ghee varies from about 15 to about 40, and so it was thought desirable to study three specimens of normal (30.8), high (37.4) and low (20.7) R.M. respectively. This would not only be merely representative and indicative of any constancy of feature wherewith to detect adulteration with foreign fats, but interesting from the theoretical point of view in that it would indicate which acid or acids, if any, compensated for this. high or low content of lower acids. EXPERIMENT The sample of low R.M. ghee obtained from the Porbandar State had been stored for a long time and was rancid at the time of analysis, and hence another fresh sample was procured and analysed. The fresh samples have been recorded as 1, 2 and 3 and the rancid sample as 4. The ghees were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and stored in glass-stoppered brown bottles in an ice-box till required. The analyses were carried out by the ester-frac- tionation method with an electrically heated and packed column using the method employed by Smith and Dastur [1938] of direct methanolysis and separation of the lower acids in some quantity before undertaking the Twitchell separation. The separation of the esters is illustrated by the detailed statement of results (Table I, A, B, C, D) obtained in the case of the normal R.M. ghee sample 2. Con- siderations of space do not permit of the full details of the other analyses. TABLE I(A) Lower esters Fraction B. pt. at 2 mm. from (°C.) Temp, of middle (°C.) Weight (gm.)

274 Fatty Acid Components of Indian Buffalo Ghees Results The following tables show the characteristics and structures (expressed as molar percentages of acids) of the four samples of ghee analysed. TABLE II (A) Characteristios of the samples of ghee analysed K. T. ACHAYA AND B. N. BANERJEE 275 were considered sufficient warrant for the assump- tion. The molar percentages for decenoic, dodece- noic, tetradecenoic and hexadecenoic acids came out as about 0.1, 0.1, 0.7 and 3.0 respectively, which agree fairly well with the values 0.3, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 of Smith and Dastur [1938] for cow milk-fats of generally greater unsaturation. The percentages now indicated must, however, be regarded only in the nature of an approximation of the true propor- tions of these acids in buffalo milk-fat though not far from them. A further interesting feature of these analyses is the presence of an acid higher than linoleic, cal- culated here as a C20 acid with one double bond (gadoleic), in the absence of material for more detailed analysis. The other three analyses (loc. cit.) in the literature recorded the highest unsaturated acids as linoleic and the molar percentages as 2.2 and 0.2. The most striking feature of the present results is the gradually rising contents of oleic acid as the amounts of the lower acids decrease, a relation- ship reflected in a more general way in the R.M. and iodine values. This is the more marked in that samples 1 and 2, of about the same iodine value, could be expected to contain the same amounts of oleic acid; actually, the proportions are quite different and the low iodine value of sample 2 is accounted for by its low linoleic, rather than oleic, content. Smith and Dastur [1938] observed very similar results with the cow in their work on inanition. They indicated there that several theories of the origin of these lower acids could account for the features observed among which was the theory of Hilditch and his colleagues [1941] that the lower acids are formed by the breakdown of preformed oleo-glycerides in the mammary gland. The general nature of the present results strongly favours this view, since it postulates a direct relationship between the two components in question. Moreover, the presence of lower unsaturated acids probably iden- tical with those of cow and goat milk-fat is satis- factorily accounted for in that they represent 'frag- ments of transformed oleo-glycerides which have escaped complete saturation to lower saturated acids'. The recent tentative postulate of Hilditch and Meara [1944] that the precursor in blood might well be a linoleo-glyceride does not affect the results since the production of an oleo-glyceride from a linoleo-glyceride represents a comparatively simple hydrogenation. While the first two ghees analysed are of a pattern, samples 3 and 4 fall into another class by reason of their high percentages of stearic acid. That there appear to be two such fairly distinct types of buffalo milk-fats is supported by the three other analyses extant, which are quoted below (Table III) after conversion in all cases to molar percentages. TABLE III Fatty acid composition of ghee (as molar percentages) 276 Fatty Acid Components of Indian Buffalo Ghees the stearic acid content [Hilditch and Thompson, 1936]; yet it has a fatty-acid and glyceride structure almost identical with cotton seed oil. Nor can the matter be explained by direct infiltration of the acid from cottonseed oil, since the latter has a molar content of stearic acid of only 2 per cent. Whatever may be the causes of differences of mobilization of different oils, the source of stearic acid in this case is almost certainly dietary oleic or linoleic acid. Since the effects are produced both in depot fats and in milk-fats, it may seem attractive to consider the hydrogenation as having occurred before passage of glycerides into the blood. But in view of the simultaneously lowered produc- tion of lower acids [Brown and Deck, 1930; Brown, 1931] in milk-fats, it seems more probable that the hydrogenation process takes place during selective withdrawal of glycerides in the depot tissues on the one hand and in the mammary gland on the other. There is another aspect of the question: part of the excessive fat in the diet probably passes into the liver as fatty acids, and these exert their modi- fying influence on fat being synthesized from car- bohydrate material. Two other features of interest in the analytical figures are (1) the high proportions of arachidic acid in the three fats conforming to the high-stearic type; (2) the high gadoleic acid content of ghee 1. This may be an infiltration from the groundnut cake that partly comprised the feed of the animal but too much stress cannot be laid on the slender evidence drawn from a single ester fraction. The practical implications of the three present analyses taken in the light of the detection of adul- teration are suggestive in the following way. The two features with any claim to constancy are the C16 unsaturated acid content and the C14+C16+C18 saturated acid percentages. The difficulties in the way of estimation of the former are immense; the latter feature is also of little value since the C16+C18 contents of many oils and hydrogenated oils are in the neighbourhood of the 53 per cent for the sum just mentioned. The only other figure of any in- terest is the linoleic acid content, a determination of which is possible by the iodine and thiocyanogen values together. This is not because the percentage of this acid is by any chance constant, but because of the high linoleic content of common oils which is well known; fortunately the only exception (coconut oil having a linoleic acid content of about 1.5 per cent) can easily be detected by the R.M.- P.V. relationship. An addition of as little of 10 per cent of other oils should greatly raise the small linoleic content of samples of ghee. Finally, em- phasis can still be laid on the empirical analytical 'constants' of butterfat, particularly the R.M.- P.V.-I.V. relationship. SUMMARY 1. The analyses of four samples of Indian buffalo ghee of high, normal and low R.M. value (two samples) are given in full. 2. The presence of the lower unsaturated acids, decenoic, dodecenoic, tetradecenoic and hexade- cenoic, has been tentatively postulated and their rough proportions indicated. 3. The presence of an acid higher than linoleic has been indicated and calculated as gadoleic acid. 4. A striking inverse relationship between the lower acids and oleic acid, similar to the results obtained on inanition by Smith and Dastur, is discussed. 5. The effect of ingesting cottonseed oil has been shown to be a greatly increased stearic acid content, The mechanism of this high production has been discussed. 6. The determination of the linoleic acid content has been theoretically postulated as likely to help in the determination of the genuineness or otherwise of a sample of buffalo butterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND SEASONAL INCIDENCE OF SURRA IN INDIA By.B. C. BASU, D. Sc., Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 29 October 1945) (With three text-figures) THE data, which form the subject of this note, were obtained from directors of veterinary services of provinces and states and pertain to a period of three years from January 1940 to December 1942. The figures are shown in Table I. A map (Fig. 3) has been prepared from these figures showing the intensity of surra in various parts of India. Of the Indian States, only Hydera- bad, Baroda, Gwalior, Alwar, Travancore and Mysore furnished detailed information; Kashmir sent some figures, but no details were available; no informa- tion was available from the remaining Indian States or from Ajmer. It will be seen from the map that many infected areas are isolated, in reality they may have been found to be continuous with the main areas if more detailed information had been avail- able; that is, discontinuity of distribution in most cases is probably more apparent than real. The map also gives the impression that the disease is more prevalent in the areas where rainfall is scanty and the camel population is high. Unfortunately almost no information is available from Rajputana, a camel-rearing area with scanty rainfall. It will also be seen that the disease is prevalent through- out India.

These figures have been set out graphically to show the actual seasonal prevalence of bovine, equine, other (camel etc.) and total surra (Fig. 2). In the case of bovine surra, the curve is at a low level from January to June; from July it rises, reaching a peak in August and falls again in October with a slight rise in November, after which it falls again. In the case of equine surra the curve is at a low level from January to July; from August it rises reaching a peak in October after which it continues to fall till December. With camel, etc., the curve is at a low level from January to July; from August onward it rises, reaching a peak in September and gradually falls until December. There are thus peaks in three different months with the three surra groups (Fig. 2). Of course, this does not provide a conclusive proof that bovines, camel, etc. are serving as healthy reservoirs for the acute equine surra. From the composite graph (Fig. 2) showing total of bovine, equine and other surra cases it will be seen that the curve is at a low level between January and July; from August it rises, reaching a peak in September and then declining until December. Clearly therefore, as with malaria, surra also has a seasonal incidence, as may be expected. This has been represented in Fig. 3, which shows the total surra cases in the Punjab for 1940-42 and malaria cases for 1900-1908 of a city in that province [taken [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2.

280 N. D. KEHAR AND R. CHANDA from a report by Christophers (1911)]. It will be seen that the rise and fall in the number of surra cases coincide exactly with that of malaria cases. SUMMARY 1. From data so far available, the regional dis- tribution; of surra in India has been mapped. The Punjab shows a heavy incidence of the disease. 2. The occurrence of surra is seasonal. The peak period for bovine surra is in August, for equine surra it is October, and for others (camel, etc.) it is in September. In the aggregate, surra reaches its highest seasonal incidence in September. 3. The seasonal curve of surra and human malaria in the Punjab coincide. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Thanks are due to the directors of veterinary services for help in providing incidence figures. REFERENCE Christophers, S. R. (1911). Sci. Mem. Med. Sanit. Dept.

CHANDA, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 6 August 1945) ACCORDING to a recent estimate, the concentrates available in India are sufficient for only 29.1 per cent. of the adult bovine population. This does not take into account the requirements of growing animals, of equines and of the 47.9 million sheep and 37.7 million goats. Although, during post-war developments, it is considered that there will be an all-round increase in the yield of foodgrains and fodder, it will be some time before developmental plans can materialize. In view of the keen shortage of feeding-stuff for livestock the nature of which in times of famine has been described by Kehar [1944], it was considered desirable to investigate whether mango-seed kernel could be utilized for feeding animals during scarcity periods. It may be pointed out that mango-seeds are at present thrown away as waste and, according to a rough estimate, the amount available may be about two million tons per annum, which would yield about one million tons of the kernel. Besides, the mango is popularly styled ' king of fruits ' and its plantation is increasing every year. Mango-seeds collected from waste heaps were broken and the kernel chemically analysed (Table I).

TABLE II Composition of some common grains Investigation on Famine Rations: Mango-seed Kernel 281 The kernels were lightly crushed and placed before country bullocks which after two to three weeks acquired a taste for them. During the exploratory period of about 15 days it was observed that animals weighing about 700-800 lb. could not eat more than 6-7 lb. (3-3.5 lb., dry matter). This amount, how- ever, did not provide the total amount of protein necessary for maintenance. It was, therefore, pro- posed to replace about 50 per cent of oil-cake by mango-seed kernels. Three country bullocks were then selected for a long-term feeding experiment, the rations shown in Table III being given daily.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Observations on bullocks. The ration was fed for about three months. It was observed that adult animals, which ordinarily maintained weight on the Institute schedule ration, gained an average of 33 lb. in weight on the experimental ration (Table IV). The animals also put on fine condition and had a healthy appearance. After about five weeks' feeding on this ration, a metabolism experiment was con- ducted on the animals by the usual procedure to find out the nutritive value of mango-seed kernel. The results showing the digestibility coefficient, nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance of the whole ration, and the digestibility coefficient of mango-seed kernel are given in Tables V, VI and VII, respectively.

Replacement of oil-cake by mango- seed kernel to the extent of 50 per cent. gives a wide positive nitrogen balance and suggests that further economy can be effected by reducing the quantity of oil-cake. The digestible nutrients per 100 lb. of dry matter as compared with those other common grains is given in Table VIII. From the above figures it appears that the digest- ible protein obtained from mango-seed kernel is only slightly poorer than that in oats and barley, while in total digestible nutrients and starch equivalent the kernel compares satisfactorily with corn and oats.

The digestible protein obtained from 80 lb. of oats is equal to that obtained from 100 lb. and starch equivalent from 86 lb. of mango-seed kernel. The high digestibility coefficient of the protein and nitrogen-free extract and the biological value of the protein give the seed a place in the list of im- portant food stuffs.

NANDA, M.R.C.V.S., GURBAX SINGH, L.V.P. and S. B. MOGRE, M. Sc., Government Livestock Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 21 October 1944) (With Plate XIV) OF the recognized methods of determining the percentage medullation in wool, only McMahon's Medullometer can be of use if a large number of samples from individual animals are to be dealt with. The other methods are too lengthy and require several days to analyse a single fleece. The use of the medullometer too is restricted to labora- tories where electric current and technically trained staff are available. With a view to guide field workers, the authors have devised a simple rapid test to estimate approximately the medullation in wool. It is based on Elphick's benzol method. It is known that a clean sample of wool when placed under benzol exhibits an intensity of whiteness in proportion to the amount of medullation in the sample. Marked difference in whiteness can easily be judged with the naked eye. For selecting sheep carrying good quality wool, the easiest course is to make small samples from these sheep, wash the amples in petrol, take an equal quantity by weight of all of them and place them side by side, under benzol, in a black enamelled tray. From the in- censity of whiteness in the samples, one can at once pick out the samples from sheep carrying better wool. This method can be used to pick out better quality sheep, but for recording the percentage of medullation in individual animals, which is so essential for breeding on scientific lines, it does not serve the purpose. To overcome this, certain standards have been devised. These standards show samples under benzol with different amounts of medullation, varying from zero to 100 per cent. For studying the approximate percentage of medul lation in a sample, the same weight of the sample, as in the standards, is placed under benzol and its percentage determined by comparison. The method, therefore, involves two main operations : (a) Making of standard samples from different breeds of sheep and (b) Studying of samples in the field in comparison with the standard samples. Making of standard samples. Two hundred small shoulder samples are taken from a particular breed of sheep. After getting rid of the free vegetable matter, each sample is first washed with a 1 per cent. neutral soap solution at 50°C. and then rinsed twice in petrol at the same temperature. After drying them at the room temperature, 100 milligrams of each sample are taken for making the standards. All these samples are put under benzol in an enamelled tray which can accommodate about 20 to 30 at a time. Judging from the intensity of whiteness shown, some samples showing varying amounts of hairiness, can be picked out. These selected samples are then arranged in series according to percentage of the medullation in them. The first one represents zero per cent and the last one 100 per cent. The intervening samples are then allotted arbitrary per- centage medullation in an ascending order to indicate increased hairiness. The percentages fixed for the samples are according to the intensity of whiteness exhibited by them. To obtain sharp contrasts, the first sample should consist of pure wool and the last of pure hair. The estimation of medullation would be more accurate if a large number of samples are taken to make up the standards. For more reliable results the percentage medullation in the series may be fixed by actually ascertaining the exact amount of medullation by the microprojec- tion method. These standards can then be used for the estimation of medullation in any given sample of wool by comparison. To have standards handy in the field, photographs of prepared sets can be used with equal efficiency. The technique consists in first taking a small sample from the sheep as close to the skin as possible. After cleaning it to get rid of all free vegetable matter and dirt, it is given a free rinsing in petrol for one to two minutes. It is then allowed to dry. One hundred milligrams of the sample are then weighed out by means of the portable balance. This quantity is spread out a little between the
284 S. G. IYER AND Z. A. HASHMI thumbs and fingers and all the fibres are brought parallel to one another. The spreading out is done to the same extent as in the standard print (Plate XIV). This resultant sample must present an homogeneous appearance. It is placed in an enamelled tray and covered by glass to press down the fibres. Benzol is then poured in the tray, till the sample is immersed. By comparing the intensity of whiteness of the sample with the standards, the medullation is estimated. By using a suitable size of tray (8 in. ×10 in. × 1 in.), 10 to 15 samples can be examined at a time. A single hand can easily test 100 to 150 samples in a day. Average medullation in a single fleece can be worked out by testing eight to ten representative samples taken from different parts of the body of a sheep. To begin with, testing of the shoulder sample is enough for classing and culling sheep under village conditions. SUMMARY With a view to guide field workers a simple rapid test to estimate approximately the medullation in wool has been devised. The test is based on the fact that a clean sample of wool, when placed under benzol exhibits an intensity of whiteness in proportion to the amount of medullation in the sample. AVIAN LEUCOSIS COMPLEX (FOWLD-PARALYSIS) IN INDIA By S. 6. IYER and Z. A. HASHMI, Poultry Research Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute Izatnagar (Received for publication on 17 September 1945) (With Plates XV-XVII) THE veterinary literature in this country contains records of paralysis in fowls attributed to a number of different causes, such as nutritional deficiencies [Mohey-Deen, 1933 ; Bachan Singh, 1940 ; Mahajan, 1934], neurolymphomatosis [Krishniengar, 1937 ; Naidu, 1938], and Ranikhet disease [Kaura and Iyer, 1937]. While reviewing these cases, Kaura [1941] remarked that 'unfortunately very little trouble has been taken to differentiate and classify the various types of paralysis and that the simul- taneous occurrence of true fowld-paralysis in the same bird where some other diagnosis has been given has been overlooked '. A systematic survey was, there- fore, undertaken to investigate the incidence and distribution of this disease in the country. SURVEY The first case diagnosed was a hen received in the laboratory for post-mortem examination in April 1941. Since then, the disease in its diverse forms has been diagnosed in Bombay, the Punjab, Hydera- bad (Dn), the United Provinces, Central Provinces, Cochin, Mysore and Madras. Both sexes and all the common breeds as well as their crosses were seen to be affected. The survey was, however, confined to the organized farms only and little information is available about the incidence in village flocks. FIELD OBSERVATIONS The prevalence of the disease was first investigated on a small commercial farm, which was started in 1936 with about 100 birds, and has been subjected to considerable in-breeding. In 1942, there were about 60 birds, mostly of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red breeds. The fertility, hatchability and viability records were unsatisfactory. Mortality was high, deaths occurring at irregular intervals Typical cases of leucosis were diagnosed which were later confirmed as (lymphoid) leucosis on histolo- gical examination. The affected fowls went light and ultimately lost control of their limbs. Lanieness started as a jerky walk, followed by inability to use one or both limbs, with the characteristic clutching appearance of the claws. As the disease advanced the fowls were unable to move and lay in a helpless condition, often with one leg stretched in front and the other behind (Plate XV, fig. 1). Drooping of on or both wings and twitching of the neck and head were also seen. Occasionally the eyes were affected the pupil in such cases becoming distorted and the iris losing its pigment and power to expand or con tract. The appetite and general appearance wen unaltered even in the last stages of the disease. In some fowls diarrhIndian J. vet. Sci., Vol. 15, Part.

Avian Leucosis Complex in India 285 PATHOLOGY The following description is based on a study of naterial from 154 natural cases of the disease from ll over the country. Gross lesions. Frequently the most striking hange noticed post-mortem was a uniform enlarge ment of the liver and spleen due to a soft, greyish- yellow infiltrating tissue (Plate XV, fig. 2). The liver was swollen to several times its normal size, weighing in some cases as much as 1¼ lb. (normal weight 2 oz.). The borders were rounded and there were small grey areas on the surface and dipping Into the organ producing a greyish roughened hob- hailed appearance. The liver was friable, resulting occasionally in upture and internal haemorrhage. In many such cases, the kidneys (Plate XVI, fig. 5) were also affected. The bone-marrow was constantly involved, being swollen, pale-grey or brick-red in colour and abnormally solid. Anaemic changes were indicated by pallor of the comb, skin and visible mucous membranes. The commonest manifestation, however, was the occurrence of tumour-like masses in the internal organs. In order of frequency in which the viscera were affected was liver, ovary, mesentery, spleen, pancreas, kidney, intestine, gizzard, proventriculus, voluntary muscle and skin. The tumours were well embedded, white or pink-grey, friable and varied in size from that of a pea to that of a hen's egg (Plate XV, fig. 3 and Plate XVI, fig. 4). Often the affection was localized, but sometimes the in- volvement of adjacent organs rendered it difficult to demarcate the boundaries of different structures. In the nervous form of the disease, characterized by paralytic symptoms during life, changes were seen mostly in the sciatic, vagus, brachial and lumbo- sacral nerves. Instead of having a healthy glistening white colour, they were greyish yellow, oedematous and enlarged to several times their original thickness (Plate XVI, fig. 6). The normal transverse striations were often indistinct. Growths, millet-seed in size, were occasionally seen on the surface of such nerves. The posterior root ganglia of the cord were found symetrically enlarged in a few cases. In the ocular form shown by blindness during life, the iris was thickened, oedematous and depigmented, the pupil being distorted. Thickening of the long bones, particularly the shanks, was seen in two localities in fowls which also showed other forms of the diease (Plate XVI, fig. 7). Histology. The enlargement of the liver was usually due to massive infiltration of the stroma with immature blood cells which predominated in the peripheral blood and abounded in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, kidneys, etc. In the liver, which is the commonest site of infiltration, both intravascular and perivascular accumulations were seen. The visceral tumours were usually composed of closely packed small and large basic-staining non- granular mono-nuclear cells (lymphocytes and lym- phoblasts). The invading cells infiltrated the parenchyma, and in some cases ultimately replaced it. There were no degenerative changes in the normal elements and these remained intact until entirely replaced by the infiltrating cells. In the liver the distribution of these cells varied from mild periportal accumulations to massive infiltrations, completely masking the normal tissue (Plate XVII, figs. 8 and 9). The lesions in the nerves consisted essentially of similar cellular infiltrations among the nerve fibres (Plate XVII, figs. 10 and 11). The brain, however, was unaffected even in the nervous form. In the eyes, the iris showed lymphoidal cell infiltra- tions ; the cornea was normal in structure, the retina usually unaltered and the optic nerve showed only slight cellular infiltration. DISCUSSION The consensus of expert opinion [Bullis, 1944] groups the several manifestations of this disease under the term 'avian leucosis complex'. As the disease is characterized by definite tissue changes and as its transmission is difficult or uncertain [Stubbs, 1938], histopathological evidence alone is considered sufficient for diagnosis. In this country, the clinical syndrome, gross lesions and histological features of the prevailing disease were seen to be typical of avian leucosis complex and comparable strictly with the disease existing in Great Britain. All the different manifestations were encountered, but a striking feature was the preponderance of the visceral form of the disease compared with the neural and ocular forms which are more commonly met with in other countries. The reasons for this are not known. All the common breeds were seen to be affected, but, as the survey was confined to organized poultry farms maintaining chiefly fowls of exotic breeds, information on the incidence in indigenous breeds is scanty. This is an urgent question for investiga- tion and warrants an extension of the survey to village flocks. It was observed in the course of this survey that the advent of the disease may be hardly noticed in a flock and the danger of its presence rarely appreciated, as only a small percentage of birds seemed to be affected at a time. The appearance of other epidemic- diseases, such as Ranikhet disease, is a spectacular event, calling for urgent measures, whereas in this disease accurate mortality records alone reveal the true measure of its import. In one of the flocks the disease has been held to be responsible for 25.6 per cent of losses in mature fowls during a period of three years. In some flocks it may be far worse, as the following statement from the Report U. S. Department of Agriculture [Winton, 1943]
286 M. M. SARWAR shows, ' Lymphomatosis, one form of ' avian leucosis complex' manifested by paralysis, grey eyes leading to blindness, and enlarged livers, continues to be the cause of close to 40.0 per cent. of the total loss. Thus the yearly loss from this disease complex alone amounts to more than 52 million dollars '. For the institution of prompt control measures the importance of detecting the disease in a flock at an early stage is evident. SUMMARY (1) The existence of ' avian leucosis complex' (fowld-paralysis) in widely-separated localities in India has been established on histopathological grounds. (2) All the common breeds were noticed to be affected, but the survey was confined to organized poultry farms primarily maintaining exotic breeds. The incidence of the disease in desi fowls in rural flocks remains to be investigated. (3) In one flock the disease persisted year after year and prevailed in all seasons. It was responsible for 25.6 per cent. of losses in adult birds during a period of three years. (4) In at least one area the disease seemed to have been spread through the distribution of stock from a central farm. (5) The clinical syndrome, gross lesions and his- tology of the disease prevailing in this country are described. These are typical of ' avian leucosis complex' and strictly comparable with those of the disease seen in Great Britain. All the different manifestations of the disease (visceral, neural, ocular and bone forms) were seen, histological examination revealing evidence of cellular infiltrations (lymphoid, myeloid and erythroid).

DEMODECTIC MANGE OF GOATS IN INDIA By M. K. SREENIVASAN, G.M.V.C., and S. W. H. RIZVI, G.B.V.C., Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 8 September 1945) (With Plate XVIII) DEMODECTIC mange of goats has been known in Europe since 1881 when Niederhausern [1881] re- corded the first case at Berne. Nocard and Railliet [1885] recorded the second case at Alfort, and Railliet [1895] described the mite and named it Demodex folliculorum var. caprae. Thereafter different work- ers reported the occurrence of this infection in other parts of Europe. In U.S.A. the first case was re- corded by Cram [1925], and recently Durant [1944] has recorded some more. To our knowledge demo- dectic mange of goats has not so far been reported in India. HISTORY A batch of 50 female goats was purchased in March 1944 from a goat market in Bareilly district of the United Provinces. All these goats were picked out from different herds of far off localities arriving at the market on the same day. They were brought to Mukteswar and housed in an out-kraal, where there was no previous history of such infection. The number of goats purchased from any one herd did not exceed five. All the animals are of non-descript plains breed with short-haired coats, and are being maintained by the Institute for breeding. In July 1944, some of the kids of this herd were found having mangy eruptions on and under the ears, but scrapings of the affected parts were negative for mites. The non- specific nature of the lesions in kids prompted us to examine all the goats thoroughly with the result that two goats were found with a squamous type of itch on the surface and border of the ears, while one goat showed nodules on the face and neck. The material from both types of lesions was found to contain Demodex. One of us (S.W.H.R.) has an opportunity to examine about 500 goats at the same market recently and was able to detect a few suffering from demodectic mange. This diagnosis was confirmed microscopically. The infection appears to exist in Farukhabad and Etah districts of United Provinces from where these goats had come. CLINICAL FEATURES Three types of lesion were encountered, viz. (1) discrete, nodules, (2) squamous dermatitis and (3) acute dermatitis over coalesced nodules with slight matting of the hair. The goat showing the nodular form was rather weak and had two kids to suckle. The nodules varied in size from a millet seed to that of a pea and were quite common and discrete on the face, neck and shoulders (Plate XVIII, fig. 1); a few were noticed on other parts of the body. On pressing the nodules a thick, greyish, ribbon-like material oozed out. This material was a mass of mites at all develop- mental stages with nymphal casts. The contents of a pea-sized nodule might roughly contain 22,000 mites. Very little loss of hair was noticed in this form but there was occasional itching. In the squamous type, loss of hair was well marked. The lesions varied in size from a silver two-anna bit to an eight-anna piece and even bigger in some cases. The lesions were more or less circular and covered with dry reddish-grey discharge which made them appear raised. Scraping the lesion was quite pain- ful and revealed a vascular base. The mites were not numerous in lesions of this type and no nodules could be detected in the affected area. The lesions were confined mostly to the ears and in some cases to the back and face (Plate XVIII, fig. 2). Harden- bergh and Schlotthauer [1925] reported a case of the squamous type of Demodex infection in goats in U.S.A. In the acute form, nodules of small size coalesced together and burst releasing a discharge which caused matting of the hair. There was more itching in this form and the goats lost condition. Probably the hair follicles were not affected as there was no loss of hair. Sometimes the lesion also extended to the teats (Plate XVIII, fig. 3). The course of the disease in its nodular form appears to be indefinite, but in the squamous and acute diffuse forms it is shorter and can perhaps be con- trolled. It is necessary to mention that, as soon as the disease was detected, all goats with the slightest suspicion of infection were removed from the healthy stock but on subsequent examinations of the' healthy' lot it was possible to pick out a few more infected animals. In all six out of 45 goats were declared diseased. The youngest animal found naturally affected was one and half year of age. No kid, even though in contact with an infected mother, has so far been found to be affected and this is in conformity with the observations of Hardenbergh and Schlott- hauer [1925]. TRANSMISSION Experimental transmission of demodectic mange is said to be very difficult and no positive results appear to have been reported. Mohler [1940] mentions that attempts to transfer the Demodex of cattle by 287 F

We have succeeded, however, in transmit- ting the goat Demodex to four out of six healthy goats in the following ways. Group 1. Three young goats (two females and one male) and one hill-bull were used. Fresh infec- tive material, obtained from a goat, was applied on both sides of the neck up to the bases of the ears after closely clipping the hair. A second application was similarly made a week later. Group 2. Three young goats (two females and one male) and one hill-bull received the same material as Group 1, but the skin was shaved before applying the infective material. A second application was made a week later. Hill-bulls were included in these experiments to see whether the mites of one species affected another, as supposed by Zurn, Babes, Lewandowsky and Scott [quoted by Hirst, 1921]. All the experimental animals were kept under strict isolation to avoid any chance infection. A month later none was showing signs of the disease. Later examinations were made at weekly intervals and at the end of four months one goat in Group 1 showed a few milletIndian J. vet.

She had whelped normally on the 10 November 1944 and suddenly went blind two days later. Symptoms. When let loose she kept walking round in an anti-clockwise direction. The pupils were dilated and there was complete loss of vision without any evident abnormality (amaurosis). She had periodic fits of excitement accompanied by loud cries. There was staggering gait in the hind limbs and the head was occasionally pushed into the corner of the kennel. Marked spasms and stiffness of the neck muscles were also observed. Later on the circle in which she walked became narrower and narrower till at last she used to rotate around her own axis. After walking a few steps the head was depressed and a complete sommersault was performed. Her body temperature ranged between 103° and 104°F. but in the last stages it came down to 102°F. Paralytic symptoms set in so that she was unable to stand. She died on 20 November 1944 under general paralysis. Post-mortem. The meninges were found congested, adherent to the brain substance and studded with small haemorrhages. The uterus contained a small quantity of brownish discharge and the uterine mucosa was inflamed. It appears that the primary focus of infection was the uterus which gave rise to meningo-encephalitis. The histopathological examination of the cerebral cortex showed acute congestion of the blood vessels with perivascular cellular infiltration. No other degenerative changes were seen. A culture from the cerebral cortex was prepared on agar and blood agar media and subcultures were made on the same media which were sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for determinative bacteriology. The organisms were found to be gram-negative rods fermenting dextrose, lactose and mannite with the production of acid and gas. It was therefore concluded that the organisms belonged to B. coli group. SUMMARY A case of meningo-encephalitis in a bitch has been described. It appeared from a post-mortem examination that the primary focus of infection was the uterus. From a study of cultures from cerebral cortex for determinative bacteriology, it was concluded that the organism belonged to B. coli group. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT My thanks are due to J. S.

SELECTED ARTICLES IN VITRO STUDIES OF THE BASIS FOR SULFANILAMIDE THERAPY IN BOVINE MASTITIS By J. C. KAKAVAS, PH.D., Newark, Delaware (With two charts) THE subject of sulfanilamide therapy in bovine mastitis has received considerable attention in recent years. Although the early reports show contradic- tory results, more recent controlled studies have revealed that sulfanilamide administered orally to a cow is of little or no curative value in permanently eradicating the streptococci from the udders of cows suffering from acute or chronic mastitis. A new approach to the problem of sulfanilamide therapy in bovine mastitis has been made in this laboratory, and the results of the findings have been reported.1 It was shown that where sulfanilamide is introduced in large amounts directly into the udder via the teat duct, mastitis streptococci are destroyed in most cases. The purpose of this report is to present a study of some of the fundamental principles which govern the activity of sulfanilamide in respect to the infecting organism. Cultures and mediums The strains of Streptococcus agalactiae employed in this study, with the exception of three cultures, had been isolated in this laboratory from chronic cases of mastitis. Cultures 090R, V-8 and K-151A were supplied by the Lederle Laboratories and represent, respectively, types I, II, and III of Lance- field group B. The identity of the cultures as Str- agalactiae was established by means of physiologic tests and serologic reactions, using the precipitin method of Lancefield and the rapid agglutination test. Some of the cultures had been carried on stock culture medium for some time previous to this study, while others were of recent isolation. The test organisms were transferred every twenty-four hours for two to three days to insure rapid growth. Each culture was then diluted in sterile water blanks sufficiently so that 1 c.c. contained approximately 500 to 2,000 living organisms. As will be shown later in this paper, the number of organisms present in the inoculum influences the degree and rapidity of their destruction by the sulfanilamide. The mediums employed in these studies were tryptose broth and tryptose agar. Their composi- tion was basically the same as described in a previous publication.1 Effect of temperature on bactericidal activity of Sulfanilamide.Sulfanilamide Therapy in Bovine Mastitis 291 TABLE 1 Bacterioidal properties of sulfanilamide on Streptococcus agalactiae determined by the cup-plate test Hrs. incubation of Petri dish with sulfanilamide before subculturing STREPTOCOOCUS AGALACTIAE CULTURE 1A 1B 1C 2A 3B 3C No. bacteria per plate No. bacteria per plate No. bacteria per plate No. bacteria per plate No. bacteria per plate No. bacteria per plate 438 4380 141 1410 400 4000 80 800 251 2510 80 800 2* b** a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b 24 . . . . 292 J. C. KAKAVAS are shown. Although the final results were com- parable to those in which the inoculum was small, the bactericidal effect of sulfanilamide in 20 mg. per cent at 40.5° C. varied directly to the amount of inoculum. The results of these tests demonstrate that sulfanilamide in concentration of 20 mg. per cent is bactericidal against Lancefield group B streptococci only when the incubation temperature is elevated above 40° C. In this respect, Lancefield group B streptococci are affected in the same way by sulfanilamide as the streptococci of Lancefield group A. These results further explain the failure of sulfanilamide to destroy Str. agalactiae infection of the udder when the drug is administered orally, Since streptococci mastitis is a nonfebrile infection, and since the limit of tolerance for the cow for sul- fanilamide administered orally is a level of 20 mg. per cent in the blood and milk, it is not possible to destroy the streptococci in the udder.

Sulfanilamide Therapy in Bovine Mastitis 293 Agar cup-plate method.294 J. C. KAKAWAS poured on and thoroughly mixed with the culture. A sterile marble was placed in the centre of the agar. When the agar hardened, the marble was removed, and the cup formed by the marble was filled with approximately 1 c.c. of 37.8 per cent homogenized suspension of sulfanilamide in liquid petrolatum. The preparation of the homogenized sulfanilamide has been described in a previous publication.1 The Petri dishes were then placed in the incubator at 37. 5° C. and at intervals of twenty-four hours, sub- cultures were made from the plates by cutting small pieces of agar at approximately 10 mm. and 30 mm. distance from the edge of the cup and inoculating into tryptose broth. The subcultures were then incubated at 37.5° C. and the presence or absence of growth was recorded at the end of seventy-two hours. The Petri dishes were incubated for 120 hours, and at the end of this period, the zone of inhibition was measured from the edge of the cup.

Under the conditions of these experiments, it was found that one part by weight of p-aminobenzoic acid nullified the germicidal effect of 25 parts by weight of sul- fanilamide for strain F-12a-4. (4) It appears from the results of these experi- ments that the therapeutic basis of sulfanilamide for Lancefield group B mastitis streptococci is based on at least three factors : the temperature of the animal at the time of treatment; the concentration of the drug at the focus of infection ; and the sulfanilamide- inhibiting substances which may be present in the infected area.

Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews 14 (2), 197-223 ALTHOUGH water metabolism is an important physiological factor having considerable bearing on animal production, the subject has not received the attention it deserves from research workers. In the published literature, most of the reference is concerned with cattle, references being very few on other farm stock. Since the dry matter of a ration is generally ad- justed to the metabolic needs of the consumer, the existence of a relationship of total water intake to the dry matter of feed might be considered probable. The available data, however, show the lack of such straightforward relationship. The absence naturally suggests several ascertainable causes which may influence water intake. A close examination of several methods of disposal of ingested water should furnish data on which the requirement can be based. The disposal of water from the body takes place through faeces and urine. A portion is vaporized to dissipate heat increment incident to food consumption. In growing or fatten- ing animal, water is retained for the newly-built tissues. In milch cows, water is disposed of in the milk. The water content of the faeces is independent of the protein content in the ration and of plane of nutrition. When, however, the ration includes a roughage of lower digestibility, the faeces voided is more moist Although data are few to study the possible correlation between the moisture and other constituents of faces, it is noted that moisture content increases with increasing crude fibre and nitrogen- free extract, but by no semblance of mathematical proportion. The fæcal moisture in cattle can be approximately reckoned as 80 per cent in steers and dry cows, and 85 per cent for milch animals. In percentage the water content in the faeces of cows in milk seems only slightly higher than that of dry animals, but as the total weight of faeces voided by the former is much greater, the difference becomes highly significant from the standpoint of water requirement. The quantity of urine in cattle is determined primarily by the amount of some non- nitrogenous substance or substances derived from roughages. If the protein ingestion is high, the urinary volume goes above that determined by the roughage intake. In steers and dry cows on maintenance ration or roughage, the weight of urine excreted will be of the order 5298 ABSTRACTS vaporization has a minimum of 2 kg. at 5° C. or 6°C. and increases slowly to about 2.5-4 kg. at 15°C., with a rapid increase to as much as 7 kg. at 21°C. and a slower further increase to an unknown limit; these observations have, however, been con- siderably influenced by the variable plane of nutri- tion and coat cover of the subjects ; (4) Atmospheric humidity; although theoretically high humidity would be expected to depress vapourization, the limited number of observations made suggested that humidity has little effect. When water lost by vaporization is plotted against total heat emission the curve obtained is roughly S-shaped, which is predictable also on theoretical grounds. Pulse and respiration rates are intimately connected with the burden of heat disposal by radiation and evaporation. Records of pulse and respiration counts in several breeds of cows in relation to milk production and summer and winter temperatures show that both rates are capable of great change. The data when properly interpreted indicate that both pulse and respiration rates are higher in breeds of higher average milk yields ; that high respiration rate is not always associated with higher milk yield, while higher pulse rate always is. Acceleration of pulse rate allows dissipation of heat both by radiation and evaporation whereas acceleration of respiration helps heat emission by evaporation only. Hence in high milk secretion, association of low respiration with high pulse rate would be advantageous in effecting economy of water for milk production. Under tropical condition at 36°C., the average respiration rate per minute of Holstein, cross-bred and zebu are 107.0, 89.3 and 46.0 respectively. The deterioraton of European cattle in the tropics is obviously due to the failure of heat disposal by radia- tion and the shift of the burden on to water evapora- tion, resulting not only in the decline in milk yield but also in the breakdown of constitution. Between Holstein and zebu, although disposal of heat varies in mode there appears to be no difference in the capacity of heat emission. But such is not the case between show and ordinary dairy cows. In a show cow producing 3,000 gallons of milk in a lactation, the heat emission by evaporation entails vaporization of 30-40 kg. of water which is almost double the amount of an ordinary dairy cow. This large evaporation seems to suggest important adaptation in respect of pulse and respiration rates, such as high pulse and low respiration count. Whatever be the nature of the adaptation, it is only the type of cow, which is capable of evaporating large amounts of water, that is likely to maintain high production in the tropics. Whether this would be true in practice or not, only further experimentation can reveal. So far as ordinary dairy cows are concerned, close shearing and the provision of shade are the only practical expedi- ents which can help in maintaining their milk pro- duction in the tropics. Since skin happens to be a medium from which heat emission takes place by evaporation and radiation, the factors which affect skin temperature have important significance. Skin tem- perature rises with the rising plane of nutrition. It is doubtful whether this is an advantage. In fatten- ing steers, heat emission and skin temperature seem to go in the reversed direction with the degree of utilization of absorbed food. As exposure to sun raises the skin temperature above that of the body this should adversely affect the normal mode of heat disposal. When the outgo of water through various channels enumerated above is reckoned against the intake of both performed and potential water in feeds, a satisfactory balance can be obtained. A proper knowledge of various channels of outgo under varied dietetic and environmental conditions should thus help in evaluating the water requirement. The water consumption of sheep, like that of the cow, varies with the type of ration, plane of nutrition and external temperature. Pregnancy seems to impose higher water requirements. Grazing on fresh pastures may cut the water requirement to nil. On the average, the requirement is 2 litres water per kg. dry food consumed. The recorded data on water requirement of the horse are meagre. By one estimate, it is 2-3 litres of water per kg. dry food consumed. The other estimate gives 35-45 litres daily. For the growing pig, a water to dry feed ratio of 3 : 1 is considered satisfactory ; at bacon weight, however, the ratio is narrowed. The consumption of water by farrowing sows is slightly greater at higher external temperature. The water requirement of pregnant and lactating sows has been calculated to be 8-12 lb. and 40-50 lb. per day respectively. The water consumption of poultry varies with live weight, external temperature and egg-production. In Leghorn hens in lay, the water requirement has been calculated at 250 gm. daily. A few observa- tions on water loss in vaporization have been made on fowls, which seem to agree generally with those recorded on cattle. [ S. C. R.] The semen of animals and its use for artificial insemination. JAMES ANDERSON (1945). Tech- nical Communication Imperial Bureau of Animal Breeding and Genetics, Edinburgh ARTIFICIAL insemination has aroused wide interest in recent years on account of its enormous possibilities in the development and improvement of livestock production. Since the publication by the Imperial Bureau of Animal Breeding and Genetics, in 1933, of a review on artificial insemination by Dr Arthur Walton, a voluminous literature has accumulated on
ABSTRACTS 299 the various aspects of the subject and there has been a great demand for a comprehensive and up-to-date resumé of information and results so far obtained. The present communication by Dr Anderson has not only removed this long-felt want but has also supplied a timely stimulus to workers on the subject, especially at the moment when the methods of artificial insemi- nation may have to be applied extensively in impro- ving and replenishing the livestock population of the world so severely depleted by the war. Literature up to 1943 has been reviewed in the main text of the publication, which is divided into three parts, and later information has been embodied in a supplement. Part I reviews exhaustively literature dealing with the study of various semen characteris- tics, such as volume, motility, concentration of sperms, pH, decline of motility of stored semen, morphology, effect of exercise on semen, fertility and the interrelationship between various semen charac- teristics of different farm animals, the study of factors affecting semen production, physico-chemical properties of semen, physiology of spermatozoa, problems of storage and transport of semen and the examination of semen. The quality of semen, so far as its fitness for artificial insemination is concerned, can be roughly estimated by determining the con- centration and motility of the sperm, but the precise evaluation would require a detailed examination of the semen with regard to appearance, volume, motility, concentration, pH and pH. change on incuba- tion, proportion of abnormal spermatozoa, respira- tion rate, resistance and longevity of sperms and freedom of semen from bacterial contamination. In part II is embodied a lively discussion about the uses and advantages of artificial , applica- tion of the method in different countries, its limita- tions and objections, and the factors affecting the insemination results. Artificial insemination has the outstanding advantage over natural mating in that it provides a means for increased use of sires, for the evaluation of young sires, for prolonging the period of use of valuable sires, for overcoming difficulties due to size difference in males and females, for the main- tenance of satisfactory conception rate, for increased use of sires in monogamous species, for hybridization, for controlling genital diseases and for economic service particularly to small herds. While discussing the problem of utilization of artificial insemination methods for the genetical improvement of stock, the author has emphasized the importance of providing suitable environment. He stresses that the successful utilization of the method would demand energetic, action-on the part of the government concerned for a systematic programme of work on a practical and scientific basis by setting up throughout the country artificial insemination centres adequately equipped and staffed with specially trained technicians. Part III describes in detail the actual technique of semen collection, the different types of apparatus used for different species of animals, handling and examina- tion of semen, preparation of the semen for insemina- tion, process of insemination and the storage of semen. Collection of semen may be made with the help of an artificial vagina or in some species by massaging the accessory genital organs or by electrical stimulation in the rectum and the lumbar region. The insemination is effected by injecting with a special syringe a small quantity of diluted semen into the cervix of the female or by depositing the semen at the bifurcation of the uterine horns. Introduction of gelatinized sperm capsules into the vagina or the cervical canal of the female has also been adopted lately as a successful method of insemination. A small chapter is included in part III on the manage- ment of sires for breeding. Part III is particularly useful to artificial insemination workers, as it gives most minute details about practical aspects of the subject. The publication comprises 150 pages of printed matter with a large bibliography and is illustrated with 19 plates and diagrams which should be extremely useful to practical workers. A copy of this publication should be an invaluable reference book for every artificial insemination worker in English-speaking countries. [ P. B.] Die Entwicklung des Riemser Adsorbatimpf- stoffes gegen Maul-und Klauenseuche und seine Herstelung (The development of Riems foot- and-mouth disease adsorbate vaccine and its preparation). O. WALDMANN, G. PYL., K. O. HOBOHM, and H. MOHLMANN (1941). Zbl. Bakt. I (Orig.) 148, 1-15 THE adsorbate vaccines are characterized by the active principle (toxin, anatoxin, virus) being attached to the surface of a finely divided substance, thereby suffering a peculiar change in its antigenic action. The authors review the use of adsorption in enzymology, diphtheria immunization and the field of virus diseases. The results so far obtained in studying the effect of adsorption on viruses, with particular reference to their antigenic properties, are summarized as follows : 1. Adsorption has no effect on the virus. Example : Equine encephalomyelitis (must be accepted with reserve as it is based on meagre work). 2. Non-infectious or weakly infectious virus sets up good immunity as adsorbate. Example : fowl-pest (Nieschulz strain). 3. Fully virulent virus loses its infectivity through adsorption without losing its immunizing power. Examples: poliomyelitis and fowl leucosis. These results are however based on laboratory experiments and have not been tried out extensively in practice. The only adsorbate vaccine against a virus disease which has been so tried out is the one used in the control of foot-and-mouth disease.
300 ABSTRACTS Earlier work on vaccination against foot-and- mouth disease, though extensive, was quite un- successful. The use of formolized virus by French workers, however, showed that the prospect was not altogether hopeless. This vaccine was intensively studies by workers in various countries and in Germany it was found that the vaccine could protect 100 per cent of guinea-pigs and 66 per cent of cattle against generalization of the infection. This method was, however, unsuitable for field application as a considerable proportion of batches of the vaccine were infective. The optimum concentration of formol lay within such a narrow range that on one side the vaccine was often infective and on the other it failed to protect ; this optimum could not be constantly attained. Recently, some Danish workers studied the adsorption of this virus on aluminium hydroxide and found that, under certain conditions, the adsorp- tion was so strong that the virus could not generally be eluted by chemical means ; and, by subcutaneous inoculation in guinea-pigs no disease, but immunity, was set up, the degree of which corresponded with the quantity of adsorbate injected. On intracuta- neous inoculation into the foot-pads, however, the adsorbate was still infective but this infectivity could be removed by heating at 25°-37°C. without loss of immunizing property. When used in cattle such a vaccine set up the disease instead of immu- nizing and the results could have no practical appli- cation. Such was the state of affairs when work on the problem was begun at Riems (The German Foot-and- mouth Disease Research Station is situated at the Baltic island of Riems, off the coast of Greifswald). Earlier Work confirmed the findings of Danish workers and a constantly safe and useful vaccine for cattle could not be made even by more prolonged incuba- tion. This difficulty was overcome by the addition of 0.05 per cent formalin and 48-hour incubation at 25°C. which sufficed to make a constantly safe and efficient vaccine. This work showed that a solution of this difficult problem had been provided by the action of formalin on the virus stabilized by adsorp- tion. The vaccine has been used on over three million animals in the field ; none of them developed the disease. Some of the inoculated animals when infected 10-14 days afterwards proved immune to massive infection. The method of preparation of the vaccine is des- cribed in detail under the following headings. The interested reader should refer to the original : (1) Ob- taining the virus including choice of production strains and method of infecting the virus-producer animals ; (2) Preparation of the virus containing material for incorporation in the vaccine ; (3) Mixing, drawing off and incubation of the vaccine; (4) Chemical test of the various reagents required and the vaccine itself ; and (5) Biological test of the vaccine for safety, bacterial contamination and immunizing capacity. [ M. A.] Fertility and hatchability when the environ- mental temperature of chickens is high. BURT W. HEYWANG (1944). Poultry Science 23, 334 THE influence of high environmental temperature on the fertility and hatchability of eggs laid by White Leghorn pullets has been investigated. The birds were kept at normal, rather than at artificially controlled, temperature conditions. They were trapnested and the eggs, collected from the nests at hourly intervals, were kept in a refrigerator at 55°F. till incubated. They were saved for incubation on the six week days and placed in the incubator the following Monday, during 12 periods between March 29 and August 21, 1943. During this entire period the same White Leghorn cockerels remained with the different groups of pullets. The data on fertility and hatchability were grouped into six lots depending upon whether the eggs were saved during a period when the maximum tempera- ture was between 80°-84.9°, 85°-89.9°, 90°-94.9° 95°-99.9°, 100°-104.9° or 105°-109.9°F. The average for each of the ranges was determined from the individual figures of the period. The figures for eggs laid by 108 pullets, when examined, showed that when the average maximum environmental temperature was 82.8°. 86.2°, 93.0°, 97.5° and 101.8°F., the fertility of their eggs was, respectively, 91.9, 93.6, 91.8, 88.8 and 82.9 per cent, and the percentage of chicks hatched from their fertile eggs was, respectively, 78.9, 77.7, 78.4, 71.8 and 68.0. The eggs laid by 63 pullets of the above group, when the average maximum air temperature was 106.8°F., were also incubated. The average figures of fertility and hatchability for this set of birds, when the average maximum environmental tempera- ture was 82.8°, 86.2°, 93.0°, 97.5°, 101.8° and 106.8°F., were, respectively, 92.5, 92.4, 91.6, 86.8, 80.4 and 73.8 per cent for fertility, and 78.8, 79.3, 78.5, 72.2, 67.9 and 55.1 per cent for hatchability from fertile eggs. The experimental results were analysed statistically and p was determined for the fertility and hatchabi- lity of the eggs laid at different environmental temperatures. This showed that at the average maximum temperatures of 101.8° and 106.8°F. fertility and hatchability were significantly lower than those of the eggs laid at the average maximum temperatures of 82.8°, 86.2° and 93.0°F. It is therefore concluded that fertility and hatch- ability are lowered when chickens are kept under high environmental temperatures. [ T.S.K.] Studies in bovine mastitisABSTRACTS 301 the Agricultural Research Council of the United Kingdom. Imperial Bureau of Animal Health, May 1944, Review Series No. 2 THIS report deals with the researches that were carried out in 20 dairy herds consisting of various breeds of cows, in five different centres extending from Ayrshire to Kent over a period of 21 months. The important cause of bovine mastitis which reduces the milk yield of dairy herds is Streptococcus agalactiae though other streptococci, staphylococci and diph- theroid bacilli cause mastitis in cattle. Mastitis due to staphylococci is more frequent and important than was once supposed. The observations described in this report indicate clearly the routes by which infection occurs and the cause of persistent herd infection. The methods of collection, sampling and examina- tion of both milk and teat swabs that were adopted as a standard throughout the investigation have been described in detail. These examinations have shown that Sir. agalactiae is a common inhabitant of the bovine udder or teat canal, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Various workers have recorded the incidence of mastitis due to Str. agalactiae. Minett reported its isolation from milk of 38.3 per cent of cows the infection varying from 10 per cent to 71 per cent in different herds. But there is no recorded information regarding the occurrence of this organism on the exterior of the teat. In this investigation of 16,482 samples of milk examined Str. agalactiae was isolated from 38.8 per cent. The results of examination of milk and teat swabs of different herds are given in tabular form. It was noticed that some cows which gave consistently positive milk tests gave very irregular results from teat swabs, while in others, where milk tests were negative, positive teat-swab tests were obtained. The relation between positive milk samples and positive teat swabs are given. Of the 2177 positive milk samples 816 or 37.5 per cent were positive for teat swabs. On the other hand of the 3599 negative milk samples only 526 or 14.6 per cent were positive for teat swabs. But of the total positive teat swabs, 61.5 per cent were associated with positive milk samples. It was proved that the successive positive teat swabs may not be due to true skin infection but to repeated contamination by milkers' hands. Sores, cracks and other blemishes on the teats become infected very frequently with Str. agalactiae. It was also noted that heavy skin infection may also occur in the absence of any lesions on the teats. It was also proved that Str. agalactiae infection often persists in the dry udder and also on the teats during the dry period. The persistent infection in dry cow is a factor in the maintenance of infection in the herd. A search for Str. agalactiae in sites other than the cow's udder was made with the following findings: 1. The occurrence of Str. agalactiae on the teats of heifers that have not been milked is extemely rare. But Str. agalactiae frequently appears in the milk of first-calf heifers during their initial lactation. 2. Str. agalactiae could not be isolated from the throat and nostrils of calves or from the vagina of cows. Some workers, have claimed isolation of this organism from the mouths of calves suckling infected cows about eight hours after suckling. 3. Str. agalactiae can be isolated from the great majority of the hands of milkers who are daily handling the teats of the cattle in any average herd. 4. Str. agalactiae is not a natural human parasite. When found on the milkers' hands or in the throat, this is simply the result of contamination from milk. 5. Sir. agalactiae has been isolated from churn handles, lids, door, knobs, broom handles and from the cups of milking machines. 6. The air of cattle sheds is contaminated with Str. agalactiae, but air-borne infection is of minor importance as compared with contact infection. A study of the relation between Str. agalactiae in milk and clinical symptoms indicated that 283 or 14.3 per cent of 1,977 samples of milk yielding Str. agalactiae were associated with signs of clinical mastitis, while only 129, or 3.7 per cent of 3,460 samples of milk not yielding Str. agalactiae were associated with signs of clinical mastitis. In other words, signs of clinical mastitis were approximately four times as frequent when Str. agalatiae was present in the milk as when it was absent. Methods of control are detection of infected cases, eliminating them from the herd, or isolating and milking the infected cows last. [M.K.S.] The effect of feeding cottonseed meal as the only concentrate on several properties of milk. 1. Fat, total solids and ash content. P. G. MILLER and G. H. WISE (1944). J. Dairy Sci. 27, 275-279 THE object of the experiment was to determine the effect of feeding cottonseed meal as the only con- centrate on several properties of milk to a group of Holstein herd. This was compared with a control group of an equal number of similar animals which was fed on a concentrate mixture consisting of four parts of corn gluten meal, two of wheat bran, two of ground corn and two of ground oats. The roughage allowed to both the groups was the same and com- prised either corn or soybean silage or pasture. In addition, both the groups were given an allowance of 2 per cent bone meal and 1 per cent salt. The experimental observation extended to a period of 16 consecutive months. The data presented showed that four months after the animals were placed on their respective feed, the milk yielded by the experimental group had com- paratively a lower percentage of total solids, fat and
302 ABSTRACTS solids-not-fat than that of the control group. There was a decrease in the ash content also which, however, followed later. [T.A.] Toxaemie jaundice in sheep. Australian Agricul- tural Newsletter, Release No. AGN/104, October, 1945, Canberra IT is expected that results of observations and experiments begun during the past 12 months will point the way to satisfactory methods of control of toxaemic jaundice in sheep. The investigation is being conducted by the Toxaemic Jaundice Committee, representing the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Departments of Agriculture of Victoria and New South Wales, and the Melbourne University Veteri- nary Research Institute. It is financed jointly by the Australia Wool Board and the Australian Meat Board. Results at the experimental farm suggest that proteins of high biological value, such as casein, have a protective action against the damage to the liver associated with toxaemic jaundice. It is also suggested that the low intake of protein during late summer and autum contributes to the liver damage, associated with storage of high amounts of copper to be found in the area in which the disease occurs. Grazing on heliotrope (Heliotropium europaeum) increased the death rate in the flock by almost 300 per cent, and deaths with signs of jaundice 21 fold. Strain due to shortage of food contri- buted to the deaths in the flock from all causes. It would appear that heliotrope causes such adverse effects because it favours a higher intake of copper by the sheep than a grass pasture. Surveys of soil and pasture are being determined. Results, it is expected, will suggest possible means of preventing intake of copper by the sheep, or of preventing excess storage of copper in the liver. There is evidence to suggest that the assimilation and storage of copper by sheep is regulated by the mineral in the soil and in the plant. Molybdenum is one mineral element which can reduce copper storage in the grazing animal. It occurs in widely varying concentrations in plants. When present in high concentration in the plant it may cause copper deficiency in the sheep although the copper con- centration in the plant remains normal. It seems possible that, if molybdenum is in very low concen- tration in the plant, a very high storage of copper may be built up by the grazing sheep. THE MAYNARD GANGA RAM PRIZE.

S. BAWA, M. R. C. V. S., Director of Veterinary Services, Sind, Karachi (Received for publication on 16 July 1945) (With Plates I and II) ACCORDING to Hutyra and Marek [1938] the earliest record of the disease is by Thomas in 1873, from Algeria and afterwards the disease was recorded in various localities of Germany during the years 1894 and 1895. Two years later the disease was recorded by Mazzmi in Italy. The prevalence of the disease in India has been reported from different provinces, viz. Sind, Bombay, Punjab, the United Provinces and the North-West Frontier Province, some 25 years ago. Shirlaw [1939] reports that the research on this condition was started as early as 19.9. Mettam [1929] and Gilbert [1937] report the occurrence of contagious pleuro-pneumonia of goats in East Africa and Palestine. Sporadic research at Imperial Vetetinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, has been going on for many years, with a view to transmitting the disease, using the material preserved in glycerine received from the Veterinary Investigation Officers from field outbreaks; but no transmission experiments were successful, as the material used to lose its potency during transit. Viswanathan [1935-36] and Bawa [1937-38] under the research scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research took up investigation into the incidence of this condition in Madras and Sind res- pectively. SYMPTOMS Affected goats separate from the flock, lie about and are not keen to grazed Dullness, partial inappetence, discharge from the nostrils which varies in amount an- viscidity, watery at first becoming mucous later on and finally mucopurulent accoms panied by cough especially on exertion, and occasional sneezing are the chief symptoms noticed in natural outbreaks. The appetite is lost and rumination ceases. Rise of tempera- ture to 106º to 107º is invariably seen in naturally and experimentally affected cases. The respiration is difficult and accelerated. Later on abdominal breathing is noticed. The animal stands with its front legs close together, its head and neck stretched forward, mouth half open showing indications of dyspnoea (Plate I, fig. 1). The bleat assumes peculiar timbre on which mzidars greatly rely for diagnosis. Auscultation and percussion reveal consolidation of the lungs. The animal drops down and dies. The loss of condition, weakness and staring coat are constant symptoms. Generally the course of the disease is acute and the duration is from three to eight days. There are a few instances in which animals have remained alive for two weeks and then died. Very rarely affected animals recover. The outbreak continues for a month or two till the majority of the animals in the flock die. Abortion up to 20 and 40 per cent is seen among the naturally and experimentally affected pregnant goats respectively in Sind. Gilbert [1937] reports that in acute outbreaks in Palestine, abortion is stated to have occurred in practically all pregnant infected animals. On the basis of experimental transmission, the incubation period is 11 to 14 days as against 8 to 28 days reported by Longley [1940] and less than 48 hours by Gilbert [1937] and 4 to 16 days by Mettam [1929]. EPIZOOTIOLOGY As regards the epizootiology of the disease, it has been observed in Sind that the disease occurs all the year round, but its incidence is more common during the months
2 Contagious Pleuropneumonia of Goats of July, August, October, January and February. Rains generally start in Sind during the middle of June; parhaps, therefore, the incidence reaches its peak during July and August due to inclement weather. Viswanathan [1937-38] records that the greater number of deaths occurred in Madras during the period from July to September. Districts of Karachi, Sukkur and Larkana are particularly free from the disease; no explanation can be offered to clear this point as meteorologically and climatically these districts do not differ much from the adjoining districts Highest incidence has been recorded in Thatparkar district and next comes Nawabshah. Mortality may be as high as 60 to 100 per cent. Recovery confers immunity and relapses are never reported. SUSCEPTIBILITY The disease is quite specific for goats. In natural outbreaks it has been seen that sheep and cattle though grazing together with affected goats do not contract the disease. Every attempt to transmit the disease to cattle, sheep and the usual laboratory animals has always failed. Longley [1940] has been able to produce fatal local reaction in five out of six ewes inoculated intramuscularly with affected muscle effusion, but he was unable to convey the disease by intranasal insufflation of pneumonic lung emulsion. Gilbert [1937] reports that the disease is caused by a filterable virus and is communicable to sheep experimentally as well as in natur al outbreaks and that sheep are less susceptible than goats. Mettam [1929] reports specificity of the virus only for goats. The virus found in Palestine must be different to that found in East Africa and India, as the former is communicable to sheep and is not specific only for goats as in the case of the latter, PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY Autopsy on 49 affected goats in actual outbreaks and on four experimental goats was conducted and no difference in the lesions of natural and experimental cases was found. The post-mortem appearances are very characteristic and are readily recogniz- able when a few cases have been seen. The presence of pleurisy and pneumonia has been a constant feature of this disease. The visceral pleura over a pneumonic lesion is constantly involved. In early and rare cases a small focus of dry pleurisy is seen but generally there is pleural exudate, which may measure as much as 300 c.c. It is clear, citron yellow in colour, odourless and free from blood and pus. The exudate readily coagulates within five minutes of opening the thorax Pneumonia may be bilateral or unilateral. Incidence of bilateral involvement is 76 per cent and unilateral 25 per cent. Lobar distribution shows that diaphragmatic lobe is most frequently affected (87.0 per cent) cardiac lobe is affected to the extent of 75 per cent and a pical lobe 62.5 per cent. Entire lungs involvement comes to 28 per cent. In all the cases, consolidation of the lungs is observed The hepatization is either red or grey in colour and it may be partial or complete, involving one or all the lobes. Two kinds of lesions are noticed, the focal (Plate I, fig 2) and the diffuse. (Plate II, fig 3). The diffuse lesion is more common and is highly characteristic; almost invariably involves the apical or cardiac lobes in part or entirely. The lung is hard and on incision exudes clear, citron yellow coloured fluid. In the majority of cases the diaphragmatic lobe has been found to be generally affected and it may be taken that infection invariably starts from that lobe. In advanced cases the lobes of the lung are found adherent to costal pleura, diaphragm and heart. In old and extensive cases, portions of the affected lungs become friable, dry and necrotic. In one experimental goat the lesions were found to be undergoing fibrosis and encapsulation. The mediastinal lymphatic glands are usually enlarged and on sectioning somewhat swollen and moist; no enlargement of spleen and liver has been noticed; pericarditis has been seen in very few cases.

ETIOLOGY The disease is due to an ultra-microscopic and filterable virus which is present in the pneumonic areas of the affected lungs and in the pleural exudate Every attempt to cultivate the etiological agent by previous works has always failed. Only recently Longley [1940] was able to isolate the causative agent and described it as a highly pleumorphic organism, which in fresh material examined by dark illumination bears close resemblance to the organism of contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia, viz. Asterococcus mycoides and gave the name Borrelomyces peripneumoniae capri. NATURAL INFECTION It is not exactly known how the disease is spread under natural conditions; mostly the disease is aerogenic in origin. It is most probable that the etiological agent of all the specific pneumoniae primarily reach the lungs through the bronchial tubes. The experimental transmission of the disease carried out at Karachi supports the view that infection is bronchogenic. EXPERIMENTAL WORK These experiments were conducted with a view to determine if the specific pneumonia of goats found in Sind is identical to that of Madras described by Longley [1940]. For experimental purposes live affected goats were brought from outside for the supply of ineffective agent as previous experience had shown that the etiological agent is very fragile and does not reach the laboratory in potent stage. PREPARATION OF INOCULA The goat was killed by cutting the throat. After clipping the skin over the throat, it was washed with lysol or dettol lotion. The fore limbs were detached from the throat and deflected then and the skin covering the sternum was reflected. The ribs were then cut through proximally and distally and the flap so produced reflected forwards thus exposing the lungs in situ. The pleural exudate was collected by meant of a sterile syringe, into a sterile glass flask containing glass beads to prevens coagulation. The suitable portions of the affected lungs (avoiding portion of lungs which had become friable, dry and necrotic) were collected into a sterile vessel and cut into small bits; these were then transferred to a sterile mortar and made into a fine pulp. The pleural exudate is added to the lung pulp and is then mixed with equal volume of cold normal saline. TECHNIQUE FOR INTRANASAL INSUFFLATION For nasal insufflation the De Vilbiss No. 15 atomiser was used with the nozzle inserted some 2 to 3 inches into the nasal cavity, the source of pressure being the hand; about 10 c. c of the prepared inocula was sprayed into each nostril and intermittent pressure on the chest wall was applied during insufflation to enforce deep respirations. Experiment No. 1. The experiment was designed to see if local reaction similar to that described by Longley could be produced by intramuscular inoculation of prepared inocula.

The pieces of affected muscles from goat No. 1 were sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, for histopathological examination. It was reported that the muscle lesion was identical with that described by Longley [1940]. The experiment (Table I) shows that the intramuscular inoculation of healthy goats with pleural exudate and lung juice results in a swelling of typical clinical and pathologi- cal characters. Experiment No. 2. It was decided in this experiment to administer the inocula to each of the three experimental goats, by intra-nasal insufflation, direct into the lung and also by intramuscular route. Into the fourth goat (control) heated inccula was administered by intra-nasal route. The experiment was designed in order to see by which route disease could be transmitted.

6 Contagious Pleuropneumonia of Goats The results of these experiments (Table II) show that the disease is transmissible by intra-nasal insufflation. The inoculum is capable of producing local reaction on intramuscular inoculation. Heating the inoculum to 60°C. for 30 minutes deprives it of its potency. Experiment No. 3. This experiment was designed to immunize the goat with the formalized lung emulsion (the method adopted in the field) and then after .7 days put her to immunity test with test dose of virulent inocula by intra-nasal route. The above experiment (Table III) shows that the goat, immunized according to the method followed in the field, failed to withstand the test dose of virulant inocula and further proves that the fatal disease can be transmitted by means of intra-nasal insufflation of the virulent inocula. Experiment No 4 This experiment was a repetition of experiment No. 1 to see if the fatal disease could be produced. This experiment (Table IV) shows that the disease can be transmitted by means of intranasal insufflation of virulent inocula. Inocula are capable of producing local reaction on intramuscular inoculation. Virulent inocula if heated to 60°C. for 30 minutes lose their potency. Experiment No. 5. This experiment was designed to see if the disease could be passed on to healthy goats by using inocula prepared from the material obtained from experimental goat No. 8 which was slaughtered on 24 September 1942.

This experiment was designed to see if active causative agent is present in pleural exudate or not. The experiment (Table VI) shows that pleural exudate is very virulent and can produce fatal local reaction; this experiment further proves that the disease can be conveyed with material from the experimental goat to the healthy goat.

This experiment was designed to see if the muscular exudate produced by intramuscular injection of pleural exudate is virulent or not.

This goat died on 26th October without show- ing any thermal reaction or other signs of disease. Postmortem examination showed 10 c. c. of pleural exudate and right dia- phragmatic and apical lobes pneumonic. Left side lung was normal. This experiment (Table VIII) proves that muscular exudate is virulent and is capable of producing fatal pneumonia. IMMUNIZATION For the first time during the year 1938 experimental vaccination was carried out in the face of an outbreak among 20 goats out of a flock of 173. The material used for vaccination was a saline emulsion of hepatized lung removed from a naturally infected goat sacrificed in extremis. The emulsion was formalized to the extent of one per cent and kept at the room temperature for 36 hours before it was used. Dose of 1 c c. in the region of neck was given to each animal irrespective of age. Vaccine was prepared according to Kolayli, Raif, Esim and Arayici [1935]. The temperature of the goats at the time of inoculation varied between 102° and 03°F. Twenty-four hours after the vaccination, two goats registered temperatures 104.2° and 106° respectively. Three of the vaccinated goats died on the 5th, 6th and 7th day after inoculation. These goats probably were in the incubative stage at the time of vaccination. Among the unvaccinated lot, 25 goats died. As this field experiment was inconclusive but showed some signs of success, it was decided to vaccinate the
8 Contagious Pleuropneumonia of Goats entire flock in the next outbreak in order to see if it was. possible to check the spread of the disease by this method. During the year 1938-1939 only one outbreak of the disease was reported; 82 goats had died of the disease, before the experimental vaccination could be undertaken. Fifty-two healthy incontact goat's were inoculated with formalized diseased lung emulsion which was kept for 24 hours at room tempe- rature before being used for vaccination. Only two deaths among the vaccinated goats were recorded and the disease was brought under control. The results of this experiment were very encouraging. Experience gained during the period 1937-1939 showed that the reaction among the vaccinated goats was not at all severe; it was, therefore, decided to inoculate the goats immediately after the preparation of the vaccine instead of keeping it at room temperature for 24 to 36 hours before its use. During the year 1939-1940 seventy-two goats were inoculated; there were three deaths among the vaccinated goats. The maldars gained confidence in this method of control and became eager to report the disease and were not indifferent as they used to be when no preventive vacci- nation for this scourage was known. During the year 1939-40 eight outbreaks were reported and a total number of 831 goats were vaccinated with an average mortality of 3.4 per cent among the vaccinated During the year 1941-42 a team of veterinary assistant surgeons was trained in the technique of the preparation of this vaccine and its use; and from the year 1942 onwards this mode of vaccination has been adopted by the Civil Veterinary Department, Sind, as a routine measure to check the spread of contagious pleuro- pneumonia in goats. Table VIII shows the number of inoculations performed during the years 1937 to 1945. TABLE VIII Number of inooculations performed during the years 1937H. S. BAWA 9 While investigating the causes of failures in certain outbreaks it was found that the veterinary assistant surgeons were using a very little quantity of diseased lung tissue and thus preparing a higher dilution which did not give satisfactory results. In one outbreak unformalized diseased lung emulsion was used but the results were not superior in any way to those obtained with formalized one. As the formalized emulsion gives some protection from external contamination in the field it has been kept in vogue. Formalized vaccine prepared from the lung tissue has been used by Viswanathan [1940] in Madras with similar results as reported by the author. Results of the vaccination in the field, in the face of outbreaks, of 30,765 goats, clearly show that goats do develop some immunity which is strong enough to ward off natural attack but is not strong enough to stand test doses of virulent inocula when given by insufflation. Longley [1940] has tried active immunization in experimental goats with (1) formalized vaccine, (2) carbolized vaccine and (3) living virus and found that living virus in doses of 5 c. c. of 1:1 pneumonic lung emulsion gives the best results when given subcutaneously in the ear ; he further noted that formalized vaccine is superior to carbolized vaccine. The present author did not have the opportunity of trying living virus in such a high concentration, viz. 1:1 pneumonic lung emulsion, firstly on account of the danger of severe reaction and secondly because as large quantity of material is required to vaccinate hundreds and thousands of goats in a flock which is not possible to obtain from one goat when slaughtered in extremis. DIAGNOSIS It is not always easy to diagnose the disease correctly because one can easily confuse it with infectious pneumonia of caprine septicaemia, haemorrhagica or patho- logical changes met with in the lungs due to rinderpest Pneumonia due to haemorrhagica septicaemia organism can be successfully inoculated into sheep, rabbits and mice, but the material from contagious pleuro-pneumonia cases fail to infect such animals According to Bawa [1940] pneumonic lesions are met in 35 to 45 per cent of cases in natural outbreaks of rinderpest in sheep and goats; these pneumonic lesions are generally accompanied by gastro-intestinal lesions. Rinderpest outbreak is never confined to goats only but numerous cases are seen in sheep as well. In the case of contagious pleuro-pneumonia the disease is always confined to goats. The injection of pleural exudate intra-muscularly or subcutaneously into the shoulder or thigh of a goat produces severe local reaction in 2 to 3 days which is typical and proves the specificity of caprine contagious pleuro-pneumonia virus. In Sind up till now not a single outbreak of infectious pneumonia, due to organisms of septicaemia haemorrhagica, has been confirmed. TREATMENT Viswanathan [1940] treated 68 goats suffering from contagious pleuro-pnemonia in different stages of the-disease with Bayer's Neosalvarsan (the dose varying from 0.0375 to 0.3 gms, depending upon the stage of the disease) resulting in 65 recoveries and 3 deaths. SUMMARY 1. Contagious pleuro-pneumonia of goats is a specific caprine disease and is responsible for a mortality of 60 to 100 per cent and shows some seasonal variations. 2 The symptoms, course, pathology and epizootology of the disease are des- cribed. 3. The etiological agent appears to be a filterable virus, since the disease is infectious and no specific pathogenic organism could be isolated. 4. The causative agent is destroyed by heat at 60°C. for half an hour. 5. The inoculation of fresh pneumonic material either subcutaneously or intra-
10 Contagious Pleuropneumonia of Goats muscularly gives rise to an acute, progressive, and usually fatal oedema at the site of the inoculation, with death in 3 to 10 days 6. The inoculation of effusions from these lesions give rise to similar lesions in. other healthy goats 7. Pleuritic and pneumonic lesions can be induced by direct extension from similar lesions in the musculature and connective tissues in the thoracic wall. 8. The pneumonia can regularly be induced by the intra-nasal insufflation of either pneumonic lung emulsion or effusion from local reactions. 9. Guineapigs and rabbits have in no instance evidenced any reaction to inoculation. 10. Immunization with formalized vaccine in the face of outbreaks have given very good results in checking the spread of the disease. 11. Five goats out of twelve experimental goats, receiving virulent inocula intra- nasally, subcutaneously or intra-muscularly aborted, i.e. there were 4l.6 per cent abortions. Only in one case the serum was found to be doubtful against A and positive against M for Brucella infection; all other samples of the serum were found to be negative for Brucella infection. 12. All the experimental evidence tend to show that the contagious pleuro-pneumonia as found in Sind is identical to that of Madras described by Longley.

Annual report of the Vetrinary Investigation Officer, Sind REFINING OF HIGH ACID GHEE By M. A. SAMUEL, K. C. SEN, ZAL R. KOTHAWALLA and NOSHIR N. DASTUR Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 27 December 1945) GHEE produced under clean conditions contains very little of free fatty acids. The Agmark standards allow free fatty acids to the extent of 2.5 per cent oleic. It is, however, found that under commercial conditions of production this limit is often exceeded and ghee with as much as 12 per cent oleic acid is not uncommon. In the trade such ghee is used to blend good ghee and bring the free fatty acid content to the prescribed limits. This practice is not sound because ultimately it results in lowering the quality of the good product also. By removing the free fatty acids from ghee, it is possible to put an wholesome product on the market. Such a practice is regularly followed in case of vegetable oils which even when fresh often contain rather large amounts of free fatty acids. In the present investigations the possibility of using such methods as can be applicable to ghee, under the existing trade conditions have been investigated. The work has been divided for the sake of convenience into two parts. The first part deals mainly with alkali refining and the second part with refining by the use of basic adsorbents. PART I Before taking up trials with alkali refining, work was carried out to see if a simpler process could be adopted. As these trials did not give very encouraging results they have only been briefly described here. (a) Heating to 120°C. did not lower the content of free fatty acids, though it helped to improve the flavour of high acid ghee. (b) Washing with hot water, four times, reduced the acidity of ghee t o the extent of about 13 per cent. The first wash was most effective in reducing the acidity. Both the colour and the flavour of ghee were improved by washing. (c) Washing with hot 3 per cent and 5 per cent solutions of commercial salt gave the same results as when hot water was used. (d) Steaming high acid ghee for an hour reduced the acidity by about 2 per cent and steaming for two hours by about 3 per cent. (e) Washing ghee three times with an equal volume of ethyl alcohol reduced the acidity by about 77 per cent. (f) Trials were carried out to neutralize the acidity with soda ash solution. For laboratory trials 10 lb. of high acid ghee was used each time. Ghee was warmed to about 65°C and transferred to a butter-churn. The requisite amount of 4.0 N soda ash solution was added and the mixture churned for 15 minutes. The contents of the churn were then transferred to a cream separator, the cream-screw having been adjusted for maximum fat output. The ghee thus obtained was given three further washings with warm water to take out all the alkali. Addition of soda ash solution all at once and in two instalments was tried but no striking difference in the reduction of acidity or in handling losses was noticed between the two methods. The results obtained are given in Table I. 11
12 Refining of high acid ghee It was found that by neutralizing with soda ash, there was a decrease of about 87 per cent in the acidity of original ghee. On refining, the ghee improved in colour but had a flat flavour. It was noticed that refining tended to raise the Reichert value to a small extent. A few samples of refined ghee were stored at 37°C. to study if there was any increase in acidity. The results obtained are given in Table II. It was found that refined ghe e was quite stable and did not again develop acidity rapidly.

Commercial quality sodium hydroxide was used for these trials. Experiments were conducted in the same manner as described in section (f) above. Different strengths of solutions, viz. 2 per cent, 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent sodium hydroxide, were used. The alkali was added all at once. The results obtained are given in Table III. It was found that the strength of sodium hydroxide solution had a marked influence on the degree of reduction in acidity. Dilute solutions were more efficient in removing the acidity. For example, with 2 per cent sodium hydroxide the decrease in acidity was 98 per cent, while with 25 per cent sodium hydroxide the decrease was 84 per cent A record of handling losses was also kept and is shown in the last column of Table III. The loss as a rule decreased with the strength of the alkali solution used. It was also observed that refining with sodium hydroxide produced a ghee with a flat flavour and a whiter appearence. Reichert values were determined on a few samples and with the treatment also there was a tendency for the Reichert value to increase as was the case with soda ash refining. (h) Neutralizing with sodium hydroxide in the presence of sodium chloride was also tried. During refining trials with alkali and during the first wash with water an emulsion was formed and it was not easy to separate the fat. The separator bowl required cleaning repeatedly and the foots as well required reseparation and also the foots require reseparation. Trials were, therefore, carried out using commercial sodium chloride to help in breaking the emulsion. The amount of salt added was calculated as a percentage of the volume of alkali solution used in refining. The base of salt at the rate of 5 per cent gave very good results, lower concentration producing little effect. Salt, dissolved in a little water was added after churning the ghee with alkali. This treatment greatly helped in minimizing the handling losses as illustrated in Table V.

A layer is formed on the top containing flour, soap and some ghee. About 80 per cent of the neutralized ghee can then be drained off. The top emulsion layer is diluted with about 25 lb. of warm water, mixed well, and separated in a cream separator. The fat obtained is given one washing with water and then mixed with the rest. The whole bulk is given two washings with about 40 lb. and 20 lb. of water respectively. Water and fat layers are allowed to separate by gravity, about 30 minutes are required for separation. If possible, it is advisable to separate the layer of ghee nearest the water phase after a second washing to minimize the loss of ghee. Though it has been mentioned in section (f) that soda ash can be used for reducing the acidity in ghee, the use of sodium hydroxide is recommended on account of its lower cost. The results obtained of various trials are given in Table VI. TABLE VI Refining of high acid ghee with sodium hydroxide, large scale trials Trial No. Quantity of ghee used in lb.

M. A. SAMUEL ET., AL. 17 From these results it will be seen that the addition of wheat flour helped greatly in minimizing the loss. In calculating the percentage loss, the amount of free fatty acids present in ghee was deducted first to get the net weight of ghee taken. The use of 15 per cent sodium hydroxide is recommended for the sake of convenience in handling; with this concentration of alkali the reduction in acidity is of the order of 92 per cent. Development of acidity in ghee refined with sodium hydroxide was studied at 70°C. for a period of six months. The results obtained are given in Table VII.

18 Refining of high acid ghee The results show that refined ghee can be kept for a considerable time without developing a high degree of acidity. PART II The studies described in the previous section show that refining of high acid ghee with alkaline solutions is quite possible. The following disadvantages of this method, from the point of view of an average ghee packer are however noticeable:M. A. SAMUEL ET., AL. 19 Calcium hydroxide, lime and magnesium oxide reduce the acidity in ghee to the extent of 9820 Refining of high acid ghee TABLE X Effect of different quantities of lime and magnesium oxide on the peroxide value of high acid ghee Weight of adsorbent added Lime Magnesium oxid Trial 1 Trial 2 Trial 3 Original ghee Refined ghee Original ghee Refined ghee Original ghee Refined ghee Original ghee Refined ghee 1 per cent 5.06 3.74 5.06 2.28 5.30 2.77 2.41 2.14 3 per cent M. A. SAMUEL ET., AL. 21 It is thus seen that heating for five minutes sufficed to reduce nearly 90 pe r cent of the free fatty acide present and that prolongation of the heating period over 40 minutes did not yield any greater benefit. (d) Filtering refined ghee. Studies reported so far were carried out by filtering the refined ghee through a filter paper. It was felt that this type of filteration may not be possible under existing trade conditions and some modification of the process was necessary. It was found that if this mixture of lime and ghee was heated to 108°C the lime and ghee phase separated out, giving a clear ghee layer at the bottom. When this happened, ghee could be easily filtered through a piece of flannel or muslin. It was further noticed that this separation was not quite clear when using 1 per cent and 2 per cent lime but with 3 per cent it was very sharp. Any temperature below 106°C. was not effective. Ghee filtered through cloth was found to have a slight turbidity on account of suspended calcium soaps The amount of calcium, estimated as CaO, on three samples of refined ghee was 0.01, 0.03 and 0.03 per cent. The presence of this little impurity did not impart any off flavour or taste to ghee. If this is considered objectionable in any way, resort will have to be taken to a steam-heated filter press. Very often filteration of the separated ghee at about 60°C. through ordinary blotting paper gives a very good product. (e) Large scale trials on refining of high acid ghee using lime.

The method can be adopted under commercial conditions with help of a centrifugal separator. Ghee is neutralized with 15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and the foots then separated by the addition of salt and wheat flour. The neutral ghee obtained is given two washings with water to remove all soaps.

Calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and magnesium oxide were found quite efficient in this respect. Use of lime is recommended on account of its ready availability and low cost. The use of lime has another great advantage in that its emulsion with ghee is easily broken by heating to 108°C., thus rendering unnecessary the employment of any special equipment. Ghee after heating with lime, requires mere filteration ; the flavour and grain structure as well as the keeping quality is considerably improved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors wish to express their grateful thanks to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research which financed this work. The high acid ghee used for these studies was obtained through the courtesy of the Chief Director of Purchase, Department of Food (Division III). The Officer-in-charge, Ghee Heating Centre No. 6 gave all the facilities for the large scale refining trials, and we wish to record our appreciation of the help given by these officers.

TUBERCULIN TESTING IN BUFFALOES WITH A DESCRIPTION OF SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE MACROSCOPIC LESIONS OF THE COW AND THE BUFFALO By H. K. LALL, B.Sc., M. R. C. V. S., Government Cattle Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 2 March 1945) (With Plate III) VETERINARIANS and laymen usually think that tuberculosis is rare in buffaloes, But this belief does not appear to be wholly based upon scientific observations. Soparkar [1925] says that the buffalo is as susceptible to tuberculosis as the cow, perhaps more susceptible, because they are heavier than cows. The same observer, in collaboration with Dhillon [1931], records that at Lahore at least 23.6 per cent of buffaloes showed either tubercular lesions on postmortem or reacted to the tuberculin test. Naik [1932] has recorded a case of generalized tuberculosis in a Jaffarabadi buffalo. Tuberculin tests carried out in the province since 1935 have shown that the disease in buffaloes in the Punjab is not uncommon. The following figures (Table I) have been taken from the reports of the Punjab Veterinary Investigation Officers for the years 1935-42 :H. K. LALL 25 In one of the tuberculin tests in the year 194226 An outbreak of Tuberclosis in Ducks laminae, more accentuated on the edge in the case of the buffalo than in that of the cow. It was usual to find a big lesion in the centre and other smaller satellites on the priphery. This arrangement was generally not seen in bovines. A strain of the organism from the lesions was isolated by Mr L. Sahai and was found to be of the bovine type. SUMMARY An account of the reaction to be tuberculin test in buffaloes is described. It is more pronounced in buffaloes than in cows ; the oedema is much more extensive. The lesions in the buffalo differ from those in the cow they are creamy white and not yellowish. The nature of the caseation also differs; it is arranged in concentric layers. Calcification, which is accentuated at edges, is not so marked but there is an increased tendency towards capsulation. The incidence of tuberculosis in buffaloes in some farms and villages is given. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Thanks are due to Mr L. Sahai, M.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, for his guidance. REFERNCES Robinson, E. M. (1914). Onderstepoort J. vet. Sci. 19, 23 Naik, R. N. (1932). Indian J. vet.

ZARGAR, G.B.V.C., Assistant Investigation Officer (Poultry), Central Provinces and Berar, Nagpur (Recefved for publication 10 December 1945) (With Plate IV) WE owe our earlier knowledge of tuberculosis in ducks to Christien, Germain and Raymond [1923], Volker [1924], Eber [1925], Klimmer [1930] and Feldman [1938]. These authors encountered isolated cases. An outbreak of tuberculosis was described by Gordon, Garside, Dobson, etc., [1940, 1941]. But our knowledge of this disease in ducks in India is very limited. Naidu [1943], while giving a list of specimens collected, just mentions a case in which the liver of a duck showed tubercular nodules. Mohteda [1944], however, records two cases of generalized tuberculosis in goose. In fact, tuberculosis has always been regarded as rare in ducks in this country and this note is just to put on record the observations made in an outbreak of tuberculosis in a flock of about 1000 ducks kept at the Military Duck Farm, Nagpur The subject under reference assumes importance and invites more attention for the simple reason that about 500 ducks of the above flock were purchased by contractors from typical Indian villages and immediately after their arrival at Nagpur, cases of generalized tuberculosis were noticed in an appreciable number among very young ducks. Furthermore, even to-day our knowledge regarding tuberculin testing of ducks is imperfect and unhelpful and we do not yet know how to eradicate the disease from an infected flock. During the past ten months the various aspects of the disease were studied in the affected flock and the observations are summarized below. Symptoms. The main signs observed in infected ducks, while alive, were progressive emaciation, anaemia and lameness. Affected ducks had, in the later stages of the disease, very dull look and showed no inclination to move. They usually lagged behind the flock and were very light Invariably breast muscles were completely atrophied with corresponding prominence of the sternum which was very evident on handling the birds. The average weight of ducks dying consequent to this infection was 1.85 lb., whereas the average weight of a duck in the flock is about 3.85 lb. Post-mortem lesions. So far, 61 carcasses of ducks have been examined and

S. L. ZARGAR 27 tuberculosis was confirmed in 33 cases, the percentage of infection being 54.1. A detailed study of all the carcasses showed that liver was affected in 32 cases (97 per cent), spleen in 27 (81 8 per cent), intestines in 14 instances (42 4 per cent) kidneys in 12 (36.4 per cent), lungs in 5 (15.2 per cent) and peritonium and gizzard in 4 (12.1 per cent). From seven cases (21.2 per cent) straw-coloured abnominal fluid varying in quantity from 75 to 250 c.c. was recovered. The lesions (Plate IV) consisted of roundish yellow nodules, varying in size from a pinhead toabout 0.8 inches. In well developed cases, caseation had developed. The cheesy material could easily be shelled out. In the beginning small and scattered lesions were whitish or pearly in appearance and crystalline in nature. When the lesions were numerous, the affected organs, usually spleen and liver, were greatly increased in dimensions. The affected and enlarged liver had invariably hard and leathery texture. The lesions in kidneys were very prominent and mostly only one kidney was involved, the other remaining apparently quite normal. Diagnosis in each case was made by demonstrating acid-alcohol-fast bacilli in each affected organ. The strain of the acid-fast organism under observation grew well on plain egg and glycerine egg media. It did not appear to be of quite the usual virulence of the avian strain, but its appearence was typically avian and it did not conform to Dobson's description of powdery pitted colonies. It also types avian Biological transmission experiments. Animal inoculation tests were carried out on ducks, fowls, pigeons and rabbits. It was observed that the morbid material was innocuous to pigeons and rabbits The two ducks which were injected intra-muscularly died on the 39th and 109th day after inoculation. One duck and a fowl, which were injected subcutaneously, died on the 49th and 103rd day after inoculation respectively. One of the four ducks, which was fed with one gram of the material from tubercular lesions, obtained from a duck destroyed in extremis died on the 114th day. In each experimental bird varying degrees of macroscopic lesions were noticed only in the liver and the spleen. Acid-alcohol-fast bacilli were demonstrated in each case. Other experimental birds are under observation. Tuberculin test. Eighty-two ducks in the flock were tested by various routes with avian tuberculin received from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The observations made so far were not very encouraging and the avian tuberculin did not appear to be of any value in the diagnosis However, attempts are being made to obtain tuberculin prepared from the strain of acid-alcohol-fast bacilli encountered in ducks at Nagpur. It is likely that this tuberculin may give us some reliable results. This work was carried out and is being continued under a Poultry Research Scheme, financed jointly by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and the Government of Central Provinces and Berar.

ECHINOCOCCOSIS IN BOVINES By M. MAQSOOD, Punjab Veterinary College, Lahore (Received for publication on 15 September 1945) (With Plate V) ECHINOCOCCUS cysts (E. polymorphus and E. multilocularis), the so-called hydatids representing the asexual stage of Echinococcus granulosus [Batsch, 1786], a cestode inhabiting principally the small intestine of the dog, occurs frequently in the liver, lungs, spleen and rarely in other organs of herbivora, man, etc., but most often in ruminants and the pig. According to Neumann [1905], Ostertag [1907] and Cameron [1934], the cysts are met with in various organs, the liver being the most favourite seat, then lungs, spleen and after them kidneys, heart muscle, intestinal wall, serous membranes, bone marrow, lymph glands, thyroid, uterus, udder and very rarely in the brain, skeleton muscle and eyes. Hemann [1934] recorded echinococcus cysts in almost every organ including most of the lymph glands of a cow which was diagnosed as a case of tuberculosis during life. Monnig [1941] in South Africa, states that in cattle harbouring hydatids only 10 per cent of the cysts are fertile, the rest being sterile (without brood capsules and scolices). In most countries, it has been found that as many as 75 per cent of cattle are infested with hydatids [Cameron, 1934: Monnig, 1941]. INCIDENCE OF BOVINE ECHINCOCCOSIS IN INDIA In India the available literature shows that 70 to 80 per cent or even higher [Pease, 1902 ; Enwards, 1927] of bovines harbour hydatids of Taenia echinococcus usually without exhibiting clinical symptoms, and that the cysts are frequently seen in the liver, lungs, spleen and rarely in other organs [Gaiger, 1915 ; Bhalerao, 1935]. Ganguley [1923] in Bengal, Rahimuddin [1943] in Madras and Maqsood [1944] at Lahore have recorded echinococcus cysts in the heart muscle of a cow, a bullock and a buffalo-cow respectively. Ayyar [1941] recorded multiple hydatids in the lungs, liver, spleen and two on the trachea of a cow that died suddenly. With a view to ascertaining the percentage of infestation in bovines, post-mortem examination were performed on 34 cattle and 57 buffaloes dying of various diseases, at the Punjab Veterinary College Hospital, Lahore, from 15 October 1942 to 15 March, 1945, while carcases of 28 cattle and 283 buffaloes were examined at the Lahore Corporation Beef Slaughter House during the years 1943-44. It was observed that 66.1 per cent of cattle and 68.8 per cent of buffaloes harboured hydatids (Table I). Cysts varying in size from that of a pea to a medium-sized football, were seen in animals of all ages and were often numerous in older animals. This high percentage of infestation in bovines is associated with the large number of stray dogs in Lahore, 24 per cent of which are infested with granulosus [Pease, 1902]. Existing conditions are such that stray dogs have easy access to slaughter houses, meat shops, etc., and are fed by butchers on con- demned organs containing hydatids, etc. with the result that in due time the scolices of the fertile cysts develop into adult worms in their intestines. Consequently, this cycle of infestation goes on in the intermediate hosts and the dog. The importance of hydatids in domestic animals is mainly due to the condemnation of edible organs, but when in large numbers, they interfere with the functions of various organs as well and at times may cause death (vide infra) 28

Very large ones may give rise to cardiac disturbances but mostly attract attention when they cause sudden death from cardiac paralysis, rupture of the heart or compression of the vessels and obstructed circulation. Ganguley [1942] described a case of cardiac echinococcosis in a bullock that died suddenly due to the rupture of a degenerated cyst. Rahimuddin [1943] recorded a case of heart failure in a cow due to the presence of a goose-egg sized fertile echinococcus cyst in the wall of the left ventricle. Out of nine cases seen by the author, death occurred suddenly in five from heart failure. Site and size of echinococcus cysts in the heart The cysts may develop in any part of the heart but usually either on its external or internal surface or in the ventricular septum near the base or point of the heart, though more frequently in the walls of the ventricles, especially the left one. Cysts were distributed in the heart muscle as follows : Left ventricular wall............... 5 cases Right do do................ 3 do. Interventricular septum......... 1 do. The hydatids vary greatly in size from that of a marble to a tennis ball, or excep- tionally larger. Number and nature of echinococcus cysts in the heart In all the cases of cardiac echinococcosis there is only one vesicle which is simple, i. e. it has no secondary vesicles, either internal or external to it. Out of nine cysts found in the heart, six were fertile. Case reports 1. The subject was a black Murrah buffalo-cow, age about seven years. According to the owner, the buffalo was feeding well on 26 September 1943 but suddenly trembl- ed, fell down and died within a few minutes. There was no history of previous disease. On post-mortem examination, the carcase was found to be in excellent condition. Microscopical examination of blood films was negative for Bacillus anthracis. No lesion of pathological significance was seen in the abdominal organs except the rumen, which was
30 Echinococcosis in Bovines distended with undigested food-stuff, and the liver which contained numerous echinococcus cysts. The lungs also contained hydatids. The pericardium over the left ventricle was distended but was not adherent to the myocardium. The left ventricular wall was distended and a simple fertile echinococcus cysts, about the size of a tennis ball, was embedded in it. The auricles and the ventricles were practically empty. The cause of sudden death in this animal was cessation of cardiac function, evidently resulting from the increased pressure caused by the distended rumen on the echinococcos- ed heart [Maqsood, 1944]. 2. An aged black spotted cow was being treated for metritis in the College Hospital, and on 7 February 1914, she looked practically normal. The following day the owner reported that during the night the cow suddenly fell down and died. On post-mortem examination, a few calcified and a number of sterile hydatids were seen in the liver and two in the spleen. Hydatids were also seen in the lungs. Both auricles and ventricles were practically empty and an egg-sized fertile E. polymorphus cyst was present in the ventricular septum near the apex of the heart (Plate V, fig. 1). The mucous membrane of the uterus was thickened and the horns slightly congested. 3. An aged black buffalo-cow was brought to the College Hospital, for anti- rinderpest inoculation on 16 February 1944 The buffalo was tethered with other cases but within a short time, she shivered, fell down and died. On post-mortem examination, the carcase appeared in good bodily condition. Miscroscopic examination of the blood films was negative for any pathogenic bacteria or protozoa. Numerous sterile and a few calcified hydatids were seen in the liver, lungs, and spleen. A ruptured hydatid about the size of a walnut was seen in the internal surface of the left ventricular wall, at about its middle. 4. A six year old Dhani bullock was being used in the cart. As narrated by the cart driver, on 27 February 1945, the bullock exerted much more than normal and while doing so it shivered, staggered, fell down and died at the spot. On post-mortem examination, the blood was negative for any pathogenic bacteria or protozoa. Numerous echinococcus cysts were seen in the liver, lungs, spleen and three (one fertile and two degenerated) in the right kidney. A fertile E. polymorphus cyst about the size of a hen's egg was seen in the left ventricular wall just below the auricule ventricular junction. Both auricles and ventricles were empty. As the bullock over-exerted, its heart, which was already diseased, ultimately ceased functioning and death occurred from heart failure. 5. An emaciated aged black buffalo-cow suddenly died in the College Hospital on 7 March 1945. Previously, the animal had been feeding and ruminating well. On post-mortem examination, hydatids were seen in the liver, lungs and spleen and one in the right kidney. In the internal surface of the right ventricular wall a ruptured hydatid about one inch in diameter was seen in its upper third. HEPATIC AND PULMONARY ECHINOCOCCOSIS Echinococcus costs, mostly sterile, are commonly seen in the liver and lungs of bovines and these organs are enlarged in proportion to the number and size of cysts. At any stage of development, dath of the hydatid with subsequent inspissation, caseation, calcification or rarely suppuration of its contents may occur. In an old-standing cyst, its walls may be thickened due to the deposition of calcium salts, etc. the liquid contents diminish and its walls approximate. Finally, the vesicle disappears and the hydatid is transformed into a calcareous mass, a stage generally seen in the liver of ruminants. A few hydatids may not give rise to clinical symptoms. However, at times, it was observed that the liver and lung tissues were practically replaced by the cysts and the animals suffered from chronic digestive and respiratory disturbances during life. In two buffaloes and three cows, death occurred suddenly and on post-mortem examination large numbers of hydatids were present in the lungs, liver and spleen. In another cow, death occurred from septic peritonitis caused by rupture of a suppurating cyst situated superficially in

The incidence and relative distribution of echirrococcus cysts in the liver, lungs, spleen, heart, and kidneys of cattle and buffaloes at Lahore is recorded. 2. The hydatids in the liver and lungs vary greatly in size from that of a pea to a medium-sized football and are mostly sterile. In cases of heavy infestation where the lung and liver tissue is practically replaced by these cysts, death may supervene. 3.

SHARMA AND ASHIQ HUSSAIN (Received for publication on 31 October 1945) (With Plate VI) GUINEA-WORM infection is very common in man in some districts of India but few cases appear to have been recorded in dogs. Griffith [1888] observed a Guinea-worm in a foxterrior bitch in Cairo. Piot [1889] describes four cases of Filaria medinensis in Egypt. Cinotti [1906] recorded a case in a bitch imported into Italy from Egypt. Gaiger [1910] observed five cases of canine Filaria medinensis in the Punjab. Lieper [1910] after reviewing the literature says that there seems little room for doubt that the Guinea-worm is able to infect and attain maturity in the dog and horse if not in all the domesticated mammals. Mitter [1910] observed a case of cutaneous filariasis in a dog at the Bengal Veterinary College Hospital. It is stated in Hutrya and Marek [1938] that Dracuncul US medinensis occurs in tropical countries and is found beneath the skin in men, cattle, horses and dogs. Subject No. 1.

A pustule was seen on the internal surface of the left foreleg. The pustule burst and a Guinea-worm protruded. Three days later the exposed portion was wrapped around a match stick and the filaria removed. It measured 600 mm. in length. Another pustule from which hung about three inches of a parasite was observed a few days after on the inner surface of the metatarsus of the right hind leg below the hock. (Plate VI, fig. 1). On removal the filaria was found to measure 540 mm. in length. Still another filaria was found protruding on 31 August 1945 from the lower cervical region. This was removed and measured 540 mm long. The ulcers were surrounded by haemor- rhagic zones and discharged sero-sanguinous pus The temperature of the dog ranged between 102° and 103 4°F. The smears from the ulcer were stained with methylene blue. They revealed a large number of pus cells, a few red blood cells and a number of larvae of Filaria medinensis with cross striations and typical head and tail. The uterus of the extruding parasite got ruptured yielding a milky fluid which on microscopic examination showed numerous living larvae. Some smears were stained with Giemsa and methylene blue ; large number of larvae were seen which got better stained with methylene blue No larvae could be seen in the blood.

(Reprinted from The Journal of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, Vol. 14, No. 1, November 1942) READING the older veterinary authors, e.g. Smith, [1897 ] ; [1902] ; Friedberger. [1908], one is struck by the scope and accuracy of their clinical and pathological observations. A vast amount of research, particularly in Germany and France, has been carried out on the respiratory diseases of the horse, but most of it was done before the days of the motor transport; that is, before the methods of research into the aetiology of bacterial and virus diseases had been perfected, and as this group of diseases is particularly difficult to study it is not surprising that the subject is still some what confused. However, after having paid some attention to the question of predisposing causes and secondary bacterial invasion an attempt will be made to assess the evidence that there are four respiratory diseases of the horse each primarily due to a specific virus infection. It is far from easy to show experimentally that adverse environmental conditions will cause the onset of pneumonia, but all clinical observers appear to agree that they are of great import- ance in precipitating attacks of equine respiratory diseases. In a very fine clinical article on 'Pneumonia and Pleurisy in the Horse,' the late Sir Frederick Smith [1897] quotes Hunting as saying that ' want of condition, plus fast work, causes exhaustion, and then we only want cold, changeable weather to produce diseases of the lungs.' Smith believed exhaustion to be a 'direct exciting' cause of pneumonia, especially in young, soft horses, whereas older horses seem to possess a comparative immunity against some of the 'causes or conditions' which so freely con- tribute to the production of the disease in the young, Smith realized that the febrile attacks from which nearly all young horses suffer when first brought into stables may be associated with the process of acquiring immunity to the 'pneumonia microbe.' Pneumonia chiefly affects stabled horses and the great importance of good hygienic conditions is shown by the fact that five years after the introduction of sanitary science' into the French Army the annual incid- ence of pneumonia had dropped from 110 to 46 per thousand horses, and four years later to little more than 3½ per thousand. Long rail and sea journeys also predispose to pneumonia. Coleman (Principal of the Royal Veterinray College, 1794-1839) laid great emphasis on the importance of well-ventilated stable, but unfortunately he did not display equally good judgement on many other subjects. In parentheses, it may be said that the clinical methods of examining the chest, and the 'respiratory sounds,' described by Smith will be of great interest to all clinicians working with large domestic animals. He found the phonendoscope to be by far the best instrument as an aid to diagnosis, and the extreme care with which he conducted his exminations can be judged from the fact that they were carried out at night with sawdust as bedding to 'insure quietude ' The best types of modern stethoscopes have been described in the Lancet [1941]. Koch [cit. M' Fadyean 1938] found that normal horses harboured diplo-streptococci (see later) in the nasal passages. Boyer [1919], in an examination of the nose and mouth of normal horses, found that 8 per cent were carriers of 'Bact. Viscosus' and 12 per cent of 'Str. pyogenes' and 'Pseud. pyocyanea' respectively. Hignett [1940] isolated group C streptococci from the nasal cavity of normal horses. There can be little doubt that one or other of a number of bacterial species may be present in the nasopharynx and produce disease when host resistance is lowered. Sporadic cases of pneumonia, nasal catarrh or strangles probably arise in this way, but severe outbreaks usually occur only when large numbers of young horses, or horses which have not previously been exposed to infection, are brought to remount depots or sales yards The infectious nature of these outbreaks is probably due to a virus and, although the uncomplicated disease usually produces immunity, all observers agree that in itself it is very mild and may pass unnoticed. The severity 33
34 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse of the symptoms and the mortality probably depend, therefore, on the virulence of the secondary organisms and above all on the care which is taken of the horses as soon as the first rise of temperature occurs. This was fully realized by Fitzwygram [1894], who showed that the 'incipient attack' could be most readily detected by the use of a clinical thermometer. The Royal Army Veterinary Corps made use of this fact during the last war, and as a result the losses from respiratory diseases were greatly reduced [Edwards, 1935 b]. It will be seen from the foregoing summary that outbreaks of diseases caused by any one virus may differ greatly in their severity and also in the clinical symptoms presented, and this is probably why there is confusion regarding the clinical classification of equine respiratory diseases ; a confusion which was not apparently diminished by the experience of the last war. At that time, however, knowledge of human respiratory diseases was in no better state, and in 1918-19 influenza killed ten to twenty million people [Geddes-Smith, 1941]. On the other hand, it is well known that human 'influenza' may be a very mild disease, and the only satisfact- ory method of classification is on an aetiological basis. Considerable progress has already been made in this direction [Francis, T., 1941]. Our knowledge of equine respiratory diseases will probably only become clarified when they can be classified on an aetiological basis, and it can be definitely ascertained that a given outbreak of disease is due to a certain 'virus'. EQUINE INFLUENZA (Pink eye, influenza catarrhalis, typhoid fever, pferdestaupe) 'Malignant epidemics' which occurred about 1815 and the stringent methods which were em- ployed to control them have been described by Youatt [1831]. Three out five horses which were attacked died, and the clinical symptoms indicate that the disease was a severe form of equine influenza. He also describes equine influenza as it existed in this country during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Law [1902] has described in great detail the edizootic which paralyzed horse transport in the U. S. A. in 1872-73. Williams [1924] discussed other early epidemics and also described a severe outbreak in India in which the mortality in most groups of horses varied from 1 to 10 per cent but was occasionally as high as 20 per cent. Equine influenza caused serious inconvenience and loss during the last war [Todd and Soutar, 1938 ; Udall, 1938 ; Anon. 1941], and it is still fairly prevalent in India. Equine influenza and contagious pneumonia were confused by the early workers. The con- fusion that existed in the Army veterinary services was described by M' Fadyean [1889]. The two diseases had, however, been clearly differentiated by Falke, 1862 [see Friedberger and Frohner, 1908]. The position was again confused by the work of Ligniers [see Nocard and Leclainche, 1903], who claimed that both diseases were primarily due to pasteurella organisms. Bemelmans [1921] also distinguished clearly between the two diseases, but emphasized that equine contagious pneumonia closely resembled human influenza. This similarity has also been described by Edwards [1935 a]. It is felt, however, that no change should be made in the nomenclature of the equine diseases. The clinical manifestation of influenza vary considerably, and detailed descriptions have been given by Law [1902], Friedberger and Frohner [1908]. A characteristic feature is the marked prostration, and muscular and cardiac weakness during the early febrile stage. The temperature curve is much more erratic than in equine pneumonia. There is usually a harsh cough, the mucous membrances are reddened and there may be some nasal discharge. The conjunctiv assumes a deep red to mahogany colour, the eyelids are usually swollen and JOHN FRANCIS 35 Research work on the aetiology of influenza has been reviewed by Edwards [1935a] and by Todd and Souter [1938]. It is a highly infectious virus disease and may be set up by the subcutaneous inoculation of infected blood [this fact has been confirmed by Dale and Dollahite, 1939] or by direct or indirect contact. Saliva may be infective for at least eight months after recovery and it has been reported that a stallion transmitted infection by coitus for a period of six years. One attack of the disease confers a long-lasting immunity, but animals remain susceptible to equine contagious pneumonia. Little attention has been paid to the problem of secondary bacterial invasion in equine influenza. It is probable, however, that in the pneumonia form streptococci and perhaps also staphylococci invade the lungs, whilst the good results obtained by Marshal and Lee [cit Udall, 1938] following the use of pasteurella biological products suggest that this organism may also be of pathological importance. Krag and Tiedge [1938] isolated S. enteri- tidis, Bact. viscosum equi and C. diphtheria from the organs of horses affected with ' malignant strangles,' and it is possible that these organisms are of importance in the intestinal form of equine influenza. EQUINE CONTAGIOUS PNEUMONIA (Influenza pectoralis, contagious pleuropneumonia, brustseuche) The long incubation period (up to thirty days), irregular spread, lack of subcutaneous swellings or marked depressions during the early febrile stage and the regular temperature curve are said to differentiate this disease from equine influenza. There is often a yellowish discharge from the nose which is pathognomonic ; a dry, husky cough may be heard Friedberger and Frohner [1908] and Bemelmans [1921] both state that there is in- testinal inflammation, but manifest symptoms of intestinal disease are rare. Following the fall of the primary fever and particularly if the animal is worked, varying degrees of pneumonia and pleurisy may develop. The mortality may be as high as 20 per cent., and for many years the disease has caused serious losses amongst Army horses ; the period of the last war was no exception [Udall, 1938] The research work which established the ætiology of this disease has been reviewed by Edwards [1935a] and again by M'Fadyean [1938]. 'The disease has two causes which act separately and are responsible for different stages in the illness and different lesions...... The virus is the veritable cause in the sense that it is responsible for the spread of the disease..... ' Law [1902] noted that neither Schutz nor Lignieres had shown the experimental diseases produced by them, following the inoculation of bacteria, to be contagious and therefore did not accept their claim to have discovered the true cause of pneumonia or influenza. Gaffky and Luhrs [1910-12, cit. Edwards, 1935a] showed that this disease was caused by virus which could only be found in the lungs and at an early stage of the disease. After the primary rise of temperature of virus disappears from the lungs and the horse may recover without any very obvious signs of the disease. On the other hand, particularly if the horse is worked, bacteria may invade the lungs and a secondary rise in temperature with typical pneumonia will occur. It will be seen that this work anticipated the researches on human influenza by many years, and this was probably the first respiratory disease in which a ' dual causation ' was discovered. Infection can only be transmitted by direct contact or by rubbing lung tissue from a horse in the early stages of the disease on to the nasal or buccal mucosa, and even then the incubation period may be as long as 39 days This may explain why the disease has been considered to be non-infectious by some clinical observers, including Smith [1897], although the course of the disease as described by him suggests that he was dealing with brustseuche. Fraser [1938] has described what was probably an outbreak of this disease and states that streptococcal vaccines were valuable in reducing mortality. The experiments of Luhrs [1928, cit. Edwards, 1935a] showed that animals which had received virulent lung tissue subcutaneously were resistant to infection by intranasal or intrabuccal rubbing of infective bronchial mucus which almost invariably produced disease in control animals.
36 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse The question of secondary bacterial invasion is somewhat confused. M'Fadyean [1938] assumed that the organisms isolated by Schutz [1887] and used in his attempts to produce brustseuche were typical streptococci. This appears to be incorrect, for an examination of the original artical shows that the organism was a gram-negative bacterium which often occurred in pair and was usually encapsulated. Friedberger and Frohner [1908] also state that the ' diplo-bacteria ' of Schutz are gram-negative. It can be concluded with reasonable certainty that these were not pasteurella organisms. Nocard and Leclainche [1903] say that although the organism was originally described as gram-negative, it is now known to be gram-positive. This cannot be accepted, however, because his article on strangles [Schutz, 1888] makes it quite clear that he was already (1887) perfectly familiar with the streptococci. Osterag [1908 cit. Mitscherlich, 1941] also isolated gram-negative 'diplo-streptococci' from the lungs of horses affected with brustseuche. It can be concluded from the work of Mitscherlich [1941], which will be discussed later, that there is a gram-negative diplo-streptococcus which is pathogenic for the horse and which in some ways resembles a true streptococcus. Its grows best in a medium containing blood or serum. On blood agar plates dry pin-point colonies surrounded by hæmolytic zones are produced, and a flocculent deposit, leaving a clear supernatant fluid, is formed in 1 per cent serum broth. Continued cultivation is difficult and cultures usually die out. It is not pathogenic for guinea-pigs, but usually kills mice in from one to five days, and necrotic focci were sometimes observed in the liver. It would appear that this organism has several points of resemblance to the Neisseria group of organisms, which includes the meningo- coccus and gonococcus, and described by Topley and Wilson [1936]. Despite the foregoing discussion, streptococci were the ultimate cause of the pneumonia in the series of cases reported by M'Fadyean [1938]. and recent work in this country and abroad has clearly demonstrated the important part played by group C streptococci in respiratory and other diseases of the horse. Ligniere's conclusions that pasteurella organisms were the primary cause of equine contagious pneumonia has already been mentioned, Webb [1909] isolated pure cultures of pasteurella organisms from the lungs of horses and donkeys from pneumonia, but the clinical history of the outbreaks suggests that the virus of contagious equine pneumonia was the pirmary ætiological agent. The extensive researches of Bemelmans [1921] indicate that, whilst pasteurella organisms may be isolated from cases of infectious pneumonia, diplostreptococci, staphylococci or pseudo-pyocyanea are found more frequently. It appears that under varying conditions of time and place any of the above organisms may complicate the virus infection of contagious pneumonia. It is therefore not surprising that there was great confusion at a time when bacterial classification had not been standardized, and in the early accounts it is difficult to decide with any certainty which organism is actually being described. INFECTIOUS CATARRH (Equine infectious bronchitis, epizootic laryngetracheites, epizootic cough, Hoppegarte cough, Brussels disease, stnalma.) Waldmann and Kobe [1936] described a highly infectious virus disease characterized clinically by a dry strong cough as its chief symptom, and pathologically by lesions of bronchitis and peribronchitis. In horses kept under good conditions the disease usually ran its course as a pure virus infection, but when the preliminary symptoms were overlooked, and animals were not specially cared for. serious complications, such as broncho-pneumonia and pleurisy, occurred, due to invasion of the lungs by streptococci, sometimes followed by death. Horses were infected by the intranasal inoculation of lung filtrates and the disease was also trasmitted to pigs and cattle. Recovered animals showed at least a partial immunity. Oprescu [1938] described a similardisease which could be transmitted by the subcutaneous inoculation to blood. It is probable that infectious catarrh is similar to the condtion known to the older German writers as skalma, and apparently various types of the condition are now prevalent amongst German army horses Mitscherlich [1941] studied an outbreak affecting 176 out of 240 horses. He states that this disease can be differentiated from
JOHN FRANCIS 37 (1) Strangles by the presence of purulent nasal catarrh and the infrequency of lymph-node swellings and abscess formation. (2) Brustseuche : in this disease there is a longer incubation period, a more prolonged fever and usually a red-brown nasal discharge and dull areas in the lungs. At autopsy there is a serious effusion and a think fibrinous deposit on the pleura which is not seen in respiratory catarrh. (3) Influenza, in which there is a marked morning recession of the fever, swelling of the conjunctiva, 38 Respiratory Diseases of the Horse usually produced. It is notoriously difficult to produce immunity against streptococci and success has not been attained by the use of streptococcal vaccines to prevent strangles [Edwards, 1935]. The highly infectious nature of the disease and the fact that a strong immunity is usually established suggest that it is primarily caused by a virus. Bazely and Battle state that their work was 'conducted in a laboratory which for the past two and a half years has concerned itself exclusively with the study of hæmolytic streptococci,' and we can only conclude that no attempt was made to isolate a virus. Clinical observations and experiments led Arnold [1933] to conclude that strangles is primarily due to a virus which produces febrile reactions only ; a secondary invasion by streptococci pro- duce sall the recognized manifestations of the disease. The virus is responsible for the high in- fectivity and a benign uncomplicated virus infection is sometimes observed. On the other hand, sporadic case may be due to a bcteria only. The virus disease can be produced by the intra-tracheal inoculation of filtered strangles pus and this leaves the animal solidly immune to subsequent infection. A formalized filtrate produced only slight immunity. Van Dorssen [1939] concluded that 'benign strangles was caused solely by Str. equi. Richters [1935] isolated true diphtheria bacilli from the unopened lymph-nodes and nasal dis- charge of some horses affected with malignant strangles, injections of these organisms into susceptible horses produced inflammation of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and severe gastro- enteritis. He concludes, however, that neither these organisms nor streptococci are the primary cause of strangles, but that it is due to a specific virus. It has not been possible to find any subsequent publication of Richters, substantiating this view, but Beller and Traub [1941] and Rexroth [1941] reached the same conclusion. Law [1902] noted that, although horses inoculated with strangles streptococci developed abscesses, there was no evidence that the disease produced was contagious, but taken as a whole the evidence suggesting that a virus is the primary ætiological agent in this disease is not perhaps so strong as in those already described. It has already been mentioned that Krage and Tiedge [1938] isolated S. enteritides, Bact. viscosum equi and C. diptheria from the organs of horses affected with malignant strangles. LESIONS IN NERVOUS AND OTHER TISSUES The conditions described in this review are usually accepted as being respiratory diseases, but one cannot help remarking that the primary virus infection often exhibits all the features of a generalized disease. There may be marked impairment of kidney and liver function, and the predilection of the influenza virus for the intestine is well known. Traub [1941] and Rexroth [1941] noted pustular and exanthematous lesions during the course of infectious catarrh, and in an exhaustive clinical study Steffan [1941] demonstrated partial or complete auricular- ventricular heart block. The nervous and psychic disturbances which may occur during the course of respiratory diseases have been noted by most authors. Bemelmans [ 1921 ] attributed many of the primary disease symptoms to nervous derangement and Steffan [ 1941 ] has made a special study of the subject. There can be little doubt that there is a relationship between the neural damage caused and the subsequent onset of roaring, stringhalt and the other nervous affections of the horse. Ebberbeck's [ 1940 ] pathological investigations have provided much evidence in support of this view, but it is probable that nutrition [ Mitchell 1936 ] and hereditary disposi- tion also play their part. DISCUSSION The four respiratory diseases have been described as though they were separate entities, and some of their main features are summarized in Table I, but it must be admitted that, whilst the typical diseases can be recognized, there are many outbreaks which even experienced workers are unable to classify [ Theiler, 1918 ].
JOHN FRANCIS 39 TABLE I 40 Respirntory Diseases of the Horse also discussed the difficulty of differentiating strangles from the various catarrhal affections of horses. Beller and Traub [ 1941 ] noted that strangles and infectious catarrh might occur together in the same horse and after a very careful study put forward the interesting suggestion that they are both primarily due to the same virus and that the different symptoms are due to different secondary invaders or predisposition of the horse. Rexroth [ 1941 ], as a result of clinical and patholygical investigations, supported this view. Luhrs [ 1933 ]. whilst admitting that no one can mistake true epidemic equine influenza, states that there are many outbreaks of disease which one cannot easily classify and Law [ 1902 ], who was obviously familiar with the epidemic disease, says that in the slighter cases the lesions are often confined to the anterior part of the respiratory organs which are congested and red, the lesions may extend to the bronchi. In human medicine there are similar differences between epidemic and sporadic influenza, and, although in some outbreaks influenza ' A ' or ' B ' virus can be identified, in other clinically identical outbreaks no virus can be isolated. It would appear that, whilst the main clinical entitiesJOHN FRANCIS 41 are being carried out by the German Army veterinary services are of a high standard. It is pleasing to note [ J.A.V.M.A. 91-254 ] that progress is being made, at the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps Laboratory, Front Royal, in the study of various respiratory diseases of the horse and that vaccines against influenza and strangles are being developed.

Assoc. 105, 39 RECENT work at the University of Wisconsin shows that faulty nutrition of calves is largely responsible for the high incidence and fatalities in scours, pneumonias, navel infections and general unthriftiness and that the situation radically improves with proper nutrition of calves. Insufficiency of vitamin A and nicotinic acid in the diet is said to be one important cause of scour in calves (British workers have shown, however, that lack of vitamin A is not a causal but a predisposing factor). Calves are lacking or deficient in vitamin A at birth, and it is vital to their well-being and growth that colostrum be available in adequate amounts not only as a rich source of vitamin A but also of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin D and riboflavin. Severe vitamin A deficiency is exhibited in symptoms of ' cold in the head' with cough and scour initially mild but often progressing rapidly to a fatal outcome within 10 days of onset of symptoms ; mild deficiency is shown in retarded growth, a rough coat and general unthriftiness. The reserve of nicotinic acid in the new-born calf is just sufficient for the first few days of life. Colostrum is poor in this factor, and as some little time must elapse before rumen synthesis of the vitamin B group is established in the growing calf, and as the absorption of vitamin A is to a large extent governed by an adequate supply of nicotinic acid in the diet, the latter factor must be supplied in adequate amounts to calves at birth. Further nicotinic acid maintains the muscular tonus of the digestive tract and thereby blood circulation tonus of all the organs of digestion. Although the blood level of ascorpic acid is high at birth, this factor is rapidly utilised within the first few days of life and the calf must then rely on such supplies of this factor as are available in colostrum until, at about the third week of life, the animal commences to make this essential factor within its own tissues. The blood level of ascorbic acid is low in scours, calf pneumonias and navel-ill and a liberal supplement to the diet is essential for the prevention and control of these diseases. Rickets is occasionally seen in calves born the year when the available sunshine is insufficient to irradiate the skin ergosterol the precursor of vitamin D. The regular provision of the essential vitamins in the correct proportions is considered an effec- tive insurance against the common diseases to which the new-born calf is subject withine the first day of life. [ J. F. S] Spread of Strptococcus Agalaetiae (Imperial Bureau of Animal Health, New Haw, Weybridge, Surrey EnglandABSTRACTS 43 Str. agalactiae was found in 6,406 (38.8 per cent) of the group of samples previously mentioned. Clinical mastitis was present in 1, 284 (7.8 per cent) of these cases, but 31. 3 per cent of these clinical cases failed to yield the organism. Another disturbing factor brought out was the fact that examinations vary so widely from week to week even when conducted regularly by the same workers. In any group of cows subjected to weekly examination of the milk and of teat swabs, a very high percentage showed the organism to be present at one or more examinations. The best group of cows in this respect showed 45.7 per cent of infection, while the poorest group showed 100 per cent. Some cows showed positive milk samples repeatedly without skin infection, while others consistently showed skin infection without any positive results in the milk. It is clear that other factors may be concerned, and that a more adequate knowledge of the pathogenesis of bovine mastitis is needed before a successful attack can be launched. Segregation and elimination is too slow, too uncertain, and too costly. [USIS No. 23] Fluctuations in Numbers of Trichomonas Foetus. HAMMOND, DATUS MAND BARLETT, DAIRD E. Amer. J. vet. Res. 6, 19. INITIAL infections, when induced by coitus with infected bulls, resulted in the appearance of Trichomonas in the vagina in about one week. Counts ran consistently high for ten days, then the numbers declined gradually, and most cases were negative in 80 days. Early return to ostrum was characteristic of all cases that did not develop pyometra, and all during this later period of infection Trichomonas were scarce early in the cycle, became abundant two or three days before ostrum, and then receded abruptly. The authors (Hammond and Bartlett, Boltsville, Maryland) believe that when Trichomonas does not appear in the vagina until several weeks or months following exposure, then the females involved have been previously infected one or more times. This is also true of females that become pregnant and than about in two to five months, or else complete the pregnancy uninterrupted. Initial infection is followed by rapid multiplication in the vagina, corvix and uterus, because these organs are susceptible. This infection induces a resistance in the tissues involved in the course of two or three weeks. Thereafter they no longer support multiplication. The infection in the uterus persists for a longer time, because more time is required to render the uterus resistant, and possibly because the uterus does not always become infected at the time of exposure, but only later as a result of invasion by organisms from the vagina. Periodic appearance of Trichomonas in the vagina in the later stages of infection is due to contraction of the uterus at the onset of ostrum, and a consequent discharge of its contents. On this basis, examinations are made to best advantage in from 7 to 19 days following initial exposure, but should be made two or three days before the expected onset of ostrum in animals that have been previously infected (USIS, No. 32). Hormonal Stimulution of Estrus and Ovulation in Sheep and Goats (a Review). RALPH W. PHILLIPS, PH. D., RICHARD M. FRAPS, PH. D., AND ARCHIE H. FRANK, D. V. M., M. A. (1945). Amer J. Vet. Res., 6, 165-179 THE results of the many attempts to induce estrus and ovulation in anestrous sheep and goats by the use of gonadotropic hormones may be summarized as follows: (1) Follicular growth and ovulation can be induced in a high percentage of animals injected with gonadotropins. (2) Induction of estrus in conjunction with ovulation, as a result of treatments with gonadotropins, has been quite erratic, and no satisfactory explanation of the variable results has been found.
ABSTRACTS 44 (3) Fertility, as measured by percentage of conceptions, is generally lower in animals in which estrus has been induced or in those forcemated after induction of ovulation, than in animals bred during natural estrus. However, satisfactory fertility has been reported in some cases. Estrogens, used either alone or with gonadotropins, have given variable results. Results of trials with gonadotropins and or estrogens during the natural breeding season have also been quite variable. In some cases, apparent increases in fertility, as judged by percentage of conceptions or lambing percentages, have resulted. In other cases, no incsease or an actual lowering of fertility has resulted The variable results are difficult to explain. The indentity of hormone preparations can never be assured in the absence of chemical purity, and no protein gonadotropin is now marketed in this form It does not appear probable that this accounts in any large measure for the inconstancy of estrus response in ewes and does, owing to the relatively uniform response of laboratory animals to these same gonadotropes. Constitutional and environmental factors may play a considerable part in determin- ing the response to specific hormone treatments. These factors, if they do play an important part, are easily overcome in the induction of follicular growth and ovulation. The extent to which they influence expression of estrus is not clear, and cannot be fully understood until the mechanism of induction of estrus is determined in ewes and does. A working basis for approaching this problem is furnished by Dempsey, Hertz and Young, who advance the hypothesis that after the animal has been conditioned with, estrogens of ovarian origin, estrus is brought about by the immediate action of progesterone which is elaborated in the preovulatory follicles shortly before ovulation, as a result of release of luteinizing hormone by the anterior pituitary. The occurrence of estrus after two injections of pms. at an interval approximating the normal cycle, indicates that the corpus luteum induced by the first injection of pms may have a regulatory role. Also it has been observed (McKenzie and Terrill) that most ewes ovulate at least once before the first estrous period of a natural breedpms season. Hammond, Hammond, and Parkes state that horse ap and pms induce estring only in animals having a regressing corpus luteum ; that in the absence of a corpus luteum ovulation occurs without estrus, and that in the presence of an active corpius luteum both ovulation and estrus are usually suppressed. Work by Zavadovskii, Paduceva, and Wunder indicates that corpora lutea, induced by injection of prola no, pms, are not in all cases similar to spontaneous cyclic ones as regards function and capacity to regulate the sexual cycle. From work with laboratory animals, and the results with sheep and goats, it seems certain that time sequences in hormonal action are involved critically in the expression of normal and induced estrus. There is obvious need for further work to determine (1) The endocrine physiology of normal and experimentally induced estrus in sheep and goats and (2) the specific doses and time sequences of hormones that will induce estrus and ovulation in anestrous ewes and does.

ORIGINAL ARTICLES VACCINATION AGAINST RANIKHET DISEASE By J. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 2 April 1946) DURING the last three years we have been exploring different methods of preparing Ranikhet disease vaccine, and the results are surveyed in the present paper. As will be seen, more than one of these efforts quickly gave very encouraging results. These have not yet been investigated exhaustively, because at the time other methods appeared to be still more promising and because the urgent need of the moment was a vaccine which would help to stem severe losses from Ranikhet disease and so assist the country's war effort. In due course, it will be profitable to re-examine some of the procedures, in order to come to a more firm decision as to the vaccine that should be finally recommended. Strains of virus used. R 1, a virulent laboratory strain kept in fowls, R 10, a freshly isolated field strain kept in egg cultures, and R2, attenuated egg-passaged virus, were used. I. GEL-ADSORBED VACCINE In a preliminary report [Haddow and Idnani, 1941] an account was given of the pre- paration of a vaccine by adsorbing virus from a spleen pulp emulsion on an aluminium gel. We have since made modifications which have given better results. In the first place, since different brews of gel, prepared by the method previously described, did not give constant results, we adopted the following technique, mainly according to Willstatter, Kraut and Erbacher [1925]: One hundred c. c. of 10 per cent ammonia solution (accurately prepared) were poured into 600 c. c. of water at 63°C. containing 22 gm. of ammonium sulphate and the tempera- ture was quickly brought to 58°C. The solution was stirred vigorously, and 150 c. c. of water at 58°C. containing 76.7 gm. of ammonium alum (Baker Chemical Co.) were poured in rapidly as one lot. The mixture was shaken in a stoppered bottle for 15 minutes at 60°C., care being taken to keep the temperature constant during the process. It was then transferred to a tall jar and was washed each time with about five litres of distilled water by decantation and not by certrifugation. At the fourth washing, 80 c. c. of 20 per cent ammonia solution were added to the wash water, before it was used. The washings were repeated about 20 times, until the supernatant fluid no longer became clear. The last two or three washings occupied several days. The final suspension of 1000 c. c. was left at room temperature for at least two months before use. Vaccines prepared from such gels have not varied greatly. It appeared, however, that the spleen emulsion introduced a very variable factor into the manufacturing process, and it was, therefore, decided to use instead of spleen allanto-amniotic fluid from hens' eggs, the fluid being collected 48 hours after the inoculation of 9 or 10 day embryo. This fluid has a more constant virus content and is much cleaner to work with. Using this method, the following experiments were tried : (1) diluting the virus before adsorption ; dilutions even at 1/10, however, greatly reduced the immunizing capacity; (2) using eluates of prepared vaccine, 46 Vaccination against Ranikhet Disease TABLE I Vaccination with gel vaccine Date Type of vaccine Dose (c. c.)

The period at which complete immunity is established appears to be not less than seven days. Tests at shorter intervals gave variable results. Small scale field experiments were carried out and the results are shown in Table II. In the case of birds vaccinated on December 28 and January 13, the vaccine was transported some 90 miles in two days and during this time was kept on ice ; in the other cases it was made on the spot.

R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 47 From Table II it will be observed that all adult fowls vaccinated proved to be solid- ly immune for five months. In tests at longer intervals the immunity appeared to be waning. In chicks, the period of complete immunity was two to three months after which the results were variable. At this point in the work it became evident that other methods of vaccination, referred to below, were likely to be more immediately profitable, hence this particular line of work was dropped. It may be said, however, that the advantages of the gel vaccine are that it can be applied safely to fowls or chicks without interference with health or reduction of egg-laying ; on the other hand, the gel is troublesome to prepare and, since it does not keep well, its use, particularly in India, must obviously be limited to organized poultry farms ad- jacent to well-equipped laboratories. IIA. PIGEON PASSAGED VIRUS Various workers have commented on the fact that pigeons can be infected with Ranikher disease, but attempts to carry on the virus in this species have failed after three or four passages. One of us (J. R. H.) had carried out experiments earlier in collaboration with Iyer (unpublished), and from one of these, it appeared that further passages, though uncertain, might be more successful than was previously thought possible. We have now examined further the possibility of fixing the virus in pigeons. The previous failures may perhaps be attributed to a low virus content in pigeons dying in earlier passages before the virus is fixed, and also to the use of adult pigeons. Hence, we used material from young, 4 to 5 months old, pigeons destroyed just after the height of febrile reaction, and, as an added precaution, we inoculated eggs from each pigeon passage in order to secure large quanti- ties of virus. The first attempt, using strain R1, failed at the second passage, but a second attempt, using strain R 10, was successful. The virus recovered from the first passage was passaged twice in eggs and thence directly in pigeons until the ninth passage when it died out. Revived with egg-passaged material from the seventh pigeon passage, it was again success- fully continued by direct passage. Up to about the twentieth passage, reactions in pigeons were late (6 to 9 days) and a number survived or were rapidly improving at the time of destruction. From the twentieth passage onwards the virus appeared to be fixed, the reaction appearing in 3 to 5 days and being in all cases severe and invariably fatal. Periodic test results are given in Table III. TABLE III Inoculations with pigeon passaged virus Passages No. of fowls Result 1148 Vaccination against Ranikhet Disease Work with this strain is being pursued owing to the advantage that the pigeon virus could be transported in the living bird and no refrigeration would be necessary as is the case with other vaccines. In one experiment, healthy fowls were kept in contact with vaccinated fowls and with pigeons. The contact birds did not contract infection and they were later found to be fully susceptible. Hence, it seems there would be no danger in transporting the virus in living pigeons. IIB. DUCKLING PASSGED VIRUS One of us (J. A. I.) had previously found that Ranikhet virus could be readily trans- planted into duck embryos, and it appeared possible that, as adult ducks are known to be resistant, continued passage of the virus in duck eggs might alter its virulence for fowls. To this end, 50 passages in duck eggs were accomplished ; at the tenth passage, the virus was slightly attenuated for fowls, but continued passage produced no further noticeable attenuation, and as there was no indication that attenuation produced in this way differed from that obtained in hen's eggs, the experiment was discontinued. It was then considered that passage in very young ducklings might be more effective. Three separate attempts were made with ducklings one to ten days old, two with viruses already frequently passaged in duck eggsJ. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 49 appeared to be fixed at a point where 40 to 50 per cent of birds inoculated either died or were permanently injured, Various factors which may have led to this attenuation in the egg are mentioned by Iyer and Dobson [1940], and, when circumstances neces- sitated our taking over the work, we attempted to see how far these factors were ope- rative and if possible to define the process of attenuation more precisely. Unfortunately, owing to war requirements our efforts had to be hastened and so were confined to lines which seemed to promise quick results. To begin with, it was necessary to organize a continuous supply of satisfactory embryos and fully susceptible fowls, previous work at the Institute having been vitiated by lack of these. Local difficulties in incubation and in transporting eggs from the Poultry Research Section at Izatnagar 90 miles away also had to be overcome. Unless otherwise stated, amniotic fluid was used in all cases for transmission work, since this has a fairly constant virus content (m. 1. d. for fowls, 1 × 10-6) and can be collected easily without risk of contamination. It is convenient to use 0. 1 c. c. of the undiluted fluid as inocu- lum in passage experiments, and this dose kills the embryo within 42 hours. Lower dilutions kill embryos more slowly and at 1 × 10-7 to 1 × 10-9 death may be delayed until the third or fourth day after inoculation. Deaths at longer intervals with virulent virus have not been noted, but deaths after five to eight days have occurred with viruses altered by artificial means and in these cases there is often a very noticeable oedema of the embryo's skin. Optimal interval for passage in eggs Eggs were incubated for three, four and seven days after inoculating virus and serial passages were made at those times. As these eggs invariably became contaminated with moulds or bacteria, the three and four day series were stopped after the sixth and fifth passages respectively, at which time there was no evidence of attenuation. The seven day series was continued for 12 passages, by which time the virus had died out. It was evident from intervening tests that the virus content of eggs decreased when the period of incubation in each passage exceeded three days. In a parallel experiment in which the amniotic fluid was kept in test-tubes in the incubator between each passage the virus died out at the fifth passage. The effect of passaging at short intervals has also been tested ; for this, 24 hours was selected as suitable. The strain of virus, R 1, selected for this purpose, was one which had already been passaged 65 times at two-day intervals without under- going any change, [Iyer, 1941]. This strain was freshly isolated from fowls and then passaged regularly at the shorter intervals. Table V gives the results.

50 Vaccination against Ranikhet Disease It will be observed from Table V that during the first 50 passages the virulence was partially lost ; the change being more or less comparable to that obtained by Iyer with his line II (our R2). Further passages produced no marked loss of virulence, and what originally appeared to be a hopeful line of advance was abandoned after over 300 passages. The net result of the work done under this heading was that eggs were incubated after inoculation for 48 hours as a routine and the virus then collected. Incubation of eggs at 41.5°C. Incubating the eggs at 41.5°C. was tried but at the 15th passage the virus was still fully virulent. Heating of the virus The effect of heating the virus was examined. The virus to a final dilution of 1:10 and 1:50 was added to water raised to the temperature required. From these experiments no results of practical importance emerged, but it was noted that at all temperatures tried the virus remained alive much longer than previously reported. Thus, at 55°C. the virus was still viable after three hours, at 60°C. after one hour, and at 70°C. after 15 minutes. At 60°C. the virus after 1¼ to 1¾ hours' heating appeared to undergo a change, When inoculated into eggs the embryos died in three to seven days with typical lesions of Ranikhet disease and usually also with marked skin oedema. There were also a few faint follicular lesions. Sub-inoculation into fowls either from first or second passage from such embryos produced no reaction or immunity. That the virus was not dead was shown by the fact that direct inoculation of the heated material into chickens and fowls gave results varying from acute affection, solid immunity without reaction, to no reaction and no subsequent immunity. Gel virus as seed material It appeared from the results of the gel vaccines that it might be possible to re- cover virus in an altered form at some stage in its production. Several attempts were made and the results often conformed with those obtained during the heated virus experiments just mentioned, i. e. embryos were obtained showing typical lesions from which sub-inocula- tions in eggs were negative or only weakly positive. In no case could the infection be trans- ferred from these embryos to adult fowls. In one instance a strain comparable to those found in the heated virus and gel virus experiments was isolated from drinking water from an infected pen. No exhaus- tive investigation was made, but the occurrence of such strains may perhaps be a factor in the preservation of the few birds which survive during a natural outbreak. Mixture of virus and serum, etc. Small-scale experiments were carried out at incubator temperatures with mixtures of virus and antiserum, virus and bile, virus and crystal violet, and virus and glycerol. With the first three, the indication was that viruses were produced which behaved somewhat like those of the gel and heated viruses. When mixtures of virus and glycerol were inoculated on to embryos, virus could not be re-isolated. Testing of field strains by egg passage Iyer (loc. cit.) has suggested that strains from different outbreaks might vary in be- haviour during egg passage. To examine this point, eight strains were passaged at about monthly intervals, whenever eggs were available. After about 30 passages there was no change. The matter, however, is not regular. Thus with strain R1, which on account of its high virulence has been maintained as our stock strain in fowls, it was found in one instance that some loss of virulence had occurred from as few as three egg passages. In another trial, the same strain was passaged 54 times without visible change. For this, no satisfactory explanation can be offered. The possibility that atte- nuation may have been due to contaminating bacteria or fungi was examined with en- tirely negative results. In one case it appeared that eggs from freshly vaccinated fowls might have been a factor. In addition to the strains mentioned above, we maintained three sub-lines of Iyer's line II, designated R2B, R2C and R2D. Iyer (in the press) has reported the results of a fairly large test of the 92nd egg passage of R2B, in which the casualty rate was about 45 per cent or over. These strains were again tested by us at the 114th, 103rd and 87th passages respectively, using two fowls each time. In the case of R2B, both fowls reacted slightly and recovered, with R2C the reaction was more severe and one died, and
J. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 51 in the case of R2D both fowls died. Larger experiments were then initiated with passages 115 to 126 of R2B and these gave uniformly good results without casualties. The experi- ments covered over 100 adult birds. In addition, it was shown that, while birds under- going vaccination were infective to healthy in contacts, such infection was "silent." As expected, the number of healthy birds infected varied with the ratio of vaccinated : healthy, e. g. in one experiment where the ratio was 1 : 1 (ten birds in each group), only two healthy birds were later found to be immune. In another experiment where the ratio was 4 : 1 (16 vaccinated fowls), all four healthy were silently immunized. Chickens were also vaccinated and it was found that those under ten days old reacted violently with an occasional death and a high percentage permanently maimed. From ten days to a month the death-rate rapidly diminishes but the proportion of paralysis cases remains rather high. After one month vaccination can be satisfactorily applied and the casualty rates are nearly comparable to those in adult fowls, provided there is no intercurrent coccidial infection. Field trials Frequent titrations of the amniotic fluid in fowls and chicks have shown that an im- munizing dose was contained in a 1 × 10-6 dilution, Also the virus dies rapidly when diluted or if exposed to heat It was, therefore, considered expedient to carry out the first field trials using virus stored on ice and freshly diluted at 1/1000 at the time of inoculation. The dose given was 0.5 c. c. The results of the first field inoculation, which was carried out on the poultry farm at Izatnagar, are recorded in Table VI. 1492 birds, mostly pullets, were vaccinated, and control pens were kept to study the effect on growth and egg laying. The breeds included Rhode Island Reds, White Leghorns, local Indian, and crosses of these breeds.

The symptoms pass off rapidly and usually leave no ill effects. Mild cases of lameness also tend to recover rapidly unless intercurrent coccidial infection is present. The common helminthic infections are not affected, nor do they affect the degree of reaction during vaccination. Except for a few severe cases amount- ing to 0.5 per cent, all birds had recovered within a month. As in practice it is not convenient or economical to nurse ailing birds for long, we consider that all birds which are definitely lame or paralysed on the 14th day after vaccination should be destroyed for food. This procedure gives a total casualty rate of about 2.5 per cent, a rate which varies within small limits according to breed. In heavy placid birds, e. g. Rhode Islands the rate is lower than in light and more nervous breeds such as White Leghorn or Indian. Vaccination has no effect on subsequent growth rate either in chicks or pullets, but it markedly interferes with egg-laying. About the sixth or seventh day after vaccina- tion, egg-laying decreases and usually entirely ceases by the tenth day. Birds which have no visible reaction start laying gradually about the 14th day, and full
52 Vaccination against Ranikhet Disease production in all except those seriously affected is resumed after 21 days. A number of not less than 1000 birds forms a suitable basis for a day's work and for convenience the virus is diluted at 1:500. Thus one ampoule of virus provided vaccine for the day. Actually, experiments have shown that there is no noticeable difference in the severity of reaction between an undiluted and a diluted virus. At first only birds over four months old were vaccinated, but later it was found safe to reduce the age limit to six weeks, at which time the birds usually leave the brooders. In all, well over 100,000 have been vaccinated and the results of those for which records are available are given in Table VII. TABLE VII Vaccination with egg-passaged virus No. of birds Casualties* Percentage Where no intercurrent disease was noted 61,372 1971 3.2 Where intercurrent disease or un- favourable conditions existed 2, 147 2962 13.3 Total 83,519 4933 5.9 *Casualties include deaths and culls from all causes during 11 days from the date of vaccination. Figures are thus somewhat higher than those observed where only casualties directly attributed to vaccina- tion are recorded. The diseases encountered included Ranikhet disease, mild fowl pox, coccidiosis, mild fowl cholera, and spirochaetosis. In all cases, where flocks were clean and management was good, results were uniformly good, but where intercurrent disease, other than Ranikhet disease or unfavourable conditions existed, the casualty rate was higher. Apart from flocks where for various reasons the general standard of management was low, it was observed that dietetic errors gave rise to high casualty rates and that heavy rain or excessive heat during the period of reaction were unfavourable factors. The latter, however, were not of sufficient importance to prevent the prosecution of vaccination during the hot weather and monsoon periods, provided the birds had plenty of space. When Ranikhet disease is present on the farm, the degree of control obtained is largely dependent of course on the time taken for immunity to develop, and by experiment this was shown to be about 48 hours after inoculation. In accordance with this, it is found that in pens already infected, mortality from the disease ceases on the fourth or fifth day after vaccination. As Ranikhet disease spreads rapidly in susceptible fowls, the vaccine must be applied quickly if it is to be effective. In one small flock of 210 birds, distributed in an isolated pen of 32 birds and in three contiguous pens, the results were as follows : Isolated pen (32 birds) 1 dead and 3 sick at the time of vaccination 18 were protected Contiguous pens No. 1 and 2 (107 birds) 3 dead and 23 sick at the time of vaccination 17 were protected Contiguous pen No. 3 (71 birds) None sick 62 were protected Pen No. 3 was vaccinated first, and the high mortality in pens Nos. 1 and 2 is attributed at least in part to the fact that, despite precautions to prevent the spread of infection on instruments during vaccination, infection was spread by contact with the clothes of the operators. Although preventive vaccination has always been our objective, in several outbreaks on large farms where separate attendants are available our results indicate that it is possible to save 70 per cent of birds in pens in which the disease is not evident, about 50 per cent in pens in which the disease has clearly just started and only about 10 per cent in pens where the disease has obtained a firm hold. We have as yet had no opportunity to test the duration of immunity over the full period of a fowl's normal life. Frequent small-scale tests have been carried out from eight days to nine months after vaccination and in no case has there been noted any evidence of a break- down in immunity. Approximately 250 birds, vaccinated at ages between one and seven months, have been tested nine to fifteen months later and all have proved solidly immune.
J. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 53 One or two outbreaks of the disease have occurred on farms which possessed vaccinated fowls and in all cases the vaccinated birds resisted infection. In view of the isolated result obtained by Iyer [1941], in England in which one chicken was proved immune two years later, taken together with the fact that even very young chickens show no diminution in immunity after six months as they do in the case of gel vaccine, it is hoped that a serviceable immunity will persist for the normal life span Dried virus Undiluted virus may be kept at refrigerator temperatures without noticeable deteriora- tion for three to four months, after which a progressive reduction in virus content occurs, but, as the virus in amniotic fluid does not stand exposure to high temperatures for long, it may be completely inert after three days at 37°C.MORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES OF THE BLOOD OF HILL BULLS IN HEALTH AND DURING ACUTE THEILERIASIS* By B. M. PRASAD, G. B. V. C., Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 7 July 1944) THE purpose of the present study was to obtain precise data on the total red-cell and white-cell counts, the differential white-cell counts and the haemoglobin content of the blood of Indian cattle in health and during acute theileriasis and thereby, if possible, to discover any factor involved in the biological behaviour of the causative agent that might be utilized for evolving a method of effective treatment. Literature on the haematology of bovine blood is rather scanty and reference may be made to articles by Delaune [1940], Manresa and Reyes [1934], Sankarnarayan [1937] and Sen and Srinivasan [1937]. The only publication available specifically on a similar problem is that of Steck [1928] who studied the blood of cattle in South Africa in some detail during health and during theileriasis (East Coast fever). Summarizing the results of his studies on 13 animals, he states that with the onset of fever the leucocytes decrease in number progressively until death and that all the cells take part in this decrease. From the tables and charts illustrating Steck's paper it appears that from an average of about 13,000B. M. PRASAD 55 method recommended by Piney [1931] was generally followed. Immediately after air- drying films were put in a glass-stoppered jar containing two per cent osmic acid and allowed to stand for 30 seconds for complete fixation. They were then washed thoroughly with distilled water and stained for 10 minutes with a mixture of equal parts of a 1 per cent solution of alphanaphthol and para-phenylenediamical. They were then washed in dis- tilled water and mounted without drying on water glass, oxidase granules being stained blue. The absence of peroxidase granules together with sharper outlining of the nucleus differentiated the pathological lymphocytes from myeloblasts. The results obtained by the two methods were found to agree. Haemoglobin was estimated by the Sahli method. OBSERVATIONS During the sub-clinical period following the infective inoculation, there was a slight leucocytosis, all the cells taking part in the increase but with a slight tendency towards lymphocytosis. On an average, an increase of about 8 per cent was recorded. From the onset of clinical symptoms, characterized by a sudden rise of temperature usually 13 or 14 days after giving the infected blood, leucocytes decreased, ultimately reach- ing a marked leucopenia persisting for two or three days during the post-clinical period or until recovery was under way. The average total white-cell count worked out at about 16,000 per c. mm. of blood; a drop to 3,400 and in one case to 1,840 is worthy of notice. But, although the number of leucocytes was appreciably reduced, there was a marked monocytosis at the expense of other cells. The mean percentage of the various types of cells, as shown by the differential counts made on the animals used in the investigation, was as follows : lymphocytes 54 per cent, neutrophiles 28 per cent, eosinophiles 6 per cent and mono- nuclears about 8 per cent. One bull showed a high percentage of eosinophiles which may have been due to helminthic infection. The average percentages, as shown during the period of full clinical manifestations, were as follows : lymphocytes 6 per cent, neutrophiles 2 per cent, mononuclears 91.5 per cent and eosinophiles 0.5 per cent. These figures show a marked increase in monocytes and a relative decrease of lymphocytes, neutrophiles and eosinophiles. Of the monocytes, a certain percentage appeared to be myeloblasts. Karyorrhexis in the white corpuscles belonging to the hyaline series, as observed by Steck [1928] in the blood of animals with East Coast fever, was rarely encountered in the peripheral circulation suggesting that the accumulated cells do not undergo rapid destruction in the various organs. There was also a slight decrease in the number of red blood corpuscles. From about six to eight millions per c. mm. prior to infection, a decline to four millions and in one case to three millions was observed. Thus a drop of 33 per cent to 50 per cent in red cells may occur when the disease has sufficiently advanced. No variation, however, took place during the sub-clinical period, hut the decrease became manifest from the onset of clinical symptoms and, as in the case of the white corpuscles, persists until signs of recovery appear. It was also apparent that there is no appreciable drop in blood haemoglobin during the disease. Healthy animals in good condition appear to be more resistant to the disease than those previously used for other work, e. g. on rinderpest This observation emerges from the fact that of twelve animals discontinued from rinderpest experiments and inoculated with 20 c. c. of theileriasis blood ten succumbed to the disease, whereas, as already stated, the disease was not fatal in the six healthy hill bulls used in the present investigation after inoculation with equal quantities of blood obtained from the same control animals. It has been observed by Sen and Srinivasan [1937] that the changes occurring in the blood of an affected animal following the appearance of schizonts in the peripheral blood afford a reliable clue to its chances of recovery. In all four reactors in the present inves- tigation the first noticeable change in the blood was the occurrence of anisocytosis, dominated later by polychromatophilia and usually associated with basophilia, whilst it was not un- common to find punctate degeneration of the nucleated red cells. It would appear that the sequence of anaemic changes is of a rapidly progressive type, since all the changes des- cribed above can be seen within a week or less from the beginning of anisocytosis. The restoration to normal of the blood picture is also rapid. Samples of urine during the clinical and post-clinical periods were now and then examined for the presence of haemoglobinuria, but in no instance was any trace of haemog- lobin found on chemical examination nor were intact erythrocytes seen microscopically. Somewhat voluminous tables showing the figures for blood counts are withheld for reasons of space but are available for scrutiny at Mukteswar.
56 Distribution of Fat in Dahi Since in previously unused animals the disease was not fatal, the white cell and differen- tial counts up to the time of death were made on rinderpest discontinued animals, which to all appearances were in good condition and which were being used for maintaining the strain of theileria. In three good reactants, white cell counts were taken when the animals were in extremis. There was found to be considerable increase in the number of leucocytes, the count in one case being as high as 145,140 per c. mm. of blood. It would therefore appear that a condition of marked leucoponia, which persists during the larger part of the clinical period, suddenly develops into one of marked leucocytosis. In the differential white- cell counts there was practically no variation from that recorded during the clinical period, except that a few more immature mononuclears were noticed. The increase in the number of leucocytes in the peripheral blood immediately before death may be accounted for as follows. Numerous leucocytes were found to stagnate in the vascular system; apparently they stuck to the walls of the vessels, perhaps due to some alteration in the normal ionic charge of the blood elements and were thus prevented from leaving the organs by the veins. It may be that immediately or shortly before death, prevailing ionic conditions were disturbed and the leucocytes were no longer able to remain adherent to the vessel wall and hence were carried into the circulation. SUMMARY In experimental theileriasis slight leucocytosis was observed during the sub-clinical period, with increase in the number of lymphocytes, followed by a marked leucopenia. Differential white cell counts showed a marked relative monocytosis, indicating that monocytes play an important part in the blood pathology of theileriasis as met with in this country. There was no noteworthy reduction in haemoglobin values. Animals in good condition were comparatively resistant to the disease. The sequence of anaemic changes occurring in the blood of an infected animal afforded a fairly reliable indication as to its chances of recovery. The morphological changes occurring in the blood do not afford a clue for evolving a method of effective treatment. Further study to find out the exact nature of the agents causing death is desirable. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I am indebted to Dr S. C. A. Datta for his interest and to Dr F. C.

KOTHAVALLA, imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 29 October 1945) SINCE milk is a highly perishable article of food various methods of preserving it for various lengths of time have been adopted in a tropical country like India Like yoghurt of Balkans, koumiss of Russia and lebum of Egypt khoa, chinna and dahi are some of the various forms in which milk is preserved in India. Of all these dahi, though having a comparatively short life, forms part of the daily menu in Indian household and is immensely popular. Besides possessing bacterial flora which are helpful to the human system during digestion, it is found to be acceptable to even those who are more or less intolerant to all other forms of milk product even to ordinary milk. It is also a marketable product of great importance. The Indian dahi or curd is prepared by boiling milk, cooling it to about 104°F. and then inoculating it with a small amount of curdled milk as a 'starter'. Whole milk from cows or buffaloes or a mixture of the two is fermented in this way with
C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 57 lactic acid bacteria for the preparation of dahi. Since butterfat is the most valuable constituent of milk, it is a matter of interest to know how the fat globules are distributed as a result of the setting of milk for dahi making. The distribution of fat in dahi would affect its food value as dahi is generally served out in layers when offered for sale. It was with the idea of finding out the distribution of fat in dahi and the reasons thereof that this study was undertaken. EXPERIMENTAL Since milk used for making dahi is processed in various ways, some of the common methods were adopted in this study. Distribution of fat in dahi from boiled milk The milk used was secured from the farm herd of the Institute. Uniform quality was maintained as far as possible by using milk from the same animals in all experiments in which mixed milk was used. The milk was boiled for two minutes, cooled to 98°F., mixed a starter at the rate of 5 per cent. ; definite amounts (250 gm) of it were placed in glass beakers of uniform type and provided with lids. They were kept undisturbed at the room temperature (75°F) overnight, when the product attained the form of a coagulated mass, even though it was only a weak gel. The top layer, amounting to exactly one fourth of the total weight of the dahi, was removed with a nickel skimmer into a beaker. The second layer amounting to another one-fourth of the total weight of dahi, was scooped out into another beaker. Similarly the third and the bottom layers were removed separately. These four parts of dahi of equal weights were dissolved in strong ammonia (5 ml. for every 100 gm. of curd) and made up to known volume and the fat percentages in each sample was estimated by the usual Gerber method. The results obtained were always corrected for the dilution effected. Fat was also estimated by the Rose-Gottlieb method for a few samples and these results were in close agreement with those obtained with the Gerber s method. Since the latter method was more convenient, it was adopted for all the estimations. Six trials were conducted on each lot of cow and buffalo milk and the results obtained are presented in Table I.

58 Distribution of Fat in Dahi From the data it is clear that the top layer contains about 49.0 per cent of the total fat in dahi and the second, third and bottom layers contain 23.5, 19.9, and 7.6 per cent respectively, Distribution of fat in dahi from raw milk Milk plasma consists of a mixture of various colloids and crystalloids. It is not expected that these two groups of substances exert a similar influence on cream rising in dahi pre- pared from raw and processed milk. The specific gravity of plasma is determined largely by the mineral salts and lactose in true solution so that it is a matter of speculation whether dahi from processed milk could show normal fat rising properties, as observed in dahi prepared from raw milk. To ascertain this the effect of raw milk on the ascent of fat in dahi was next studied. The same procedure as described previously was repeated using three samples each of cow and buffalo milk. The results obtained are presented in Table II. TABLE II Fat distribution of dahi from raw milk Sample No. Percentage distribution of fat in the different layers Top layer Second layer Third layer Bottom layer Cow milk 1 59.9 20.5 15.2 4.4 2 60.0 21.1 14.1 5.0 3 57.7 21.99 15.7 5.2 Buffalo milk 1 62.5 17.5 16.4 3.5 2 63.0 18.3 14.6 3.3 3 62.8 17.2 16.3 3.6 The dahi obtained from raw milk was of a markedly loose texture, but the dahi from raw buffalo milk was comparatively firmer than that from raw cow milk. The body of dahi from raw milk was not firm enough to separate it into layers easily and during handling whey separated from the body of dahi. From the data collected, it can however be concluded that there is more ascent of fat in dahi from raw milk as compared to that from boiled milk. On an average the percentage of fat distribution on the top, second, third and bottom layers were 61.1, 19.4, 15.4 and 4.2 respectively. There appears to be no difference in the general distribution of fat in different layers of the dahi from cow or buffalo milk. Distribution of fat in dahi from pasteurized milk Milk was pasteurized by maintaining it at 145°F. for 30 minutes and then by cooling it to 98°F. It was then inoculated with a vigorous starter culture. Four samples of buffalo milk were tried and the results obtained are presented in Table III.

C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 59 The data presented in Table III show that there is no difference in distribution of fat in dahi prepared from boiled or pasteurized milk. Effect of height of the column and surface area of dahi on the fat distribution From the results of the above experiments it can be concluded that depth of the column remaining the same, the percentage distribution of fat in different layers of dahi is similar. However, it was of interest to study whether (a) the depth or the height of the column of dahi has any relation to the percentage of fat distribution in dahi and (b) the depth remaining the same, the surface area of dahi has any effect on the percentage of fat distribution. In order to investigate these problems, boiled milk after inoculation with a starter was placed in four tiered cylindrical glass containers of surface area 8.6, 10.8, 13.8 and 15.7 sq. cm. with a depth of 9 cm. and kept overnight Next morning, the dahi in each container was analysed for fat distribution. The same experiments were repeated with the same containers, but varying the height to 6 cm. and also to 3 cm. In all cases three samples of buffalo milk were taken for the experiments. The results obtained are presented in Tables IV, V and VI. TABLE IV Effect of surface area on the distribution of fat in dahi Height of dahi 9 cm. Sample No. Surface area in sq. cm.

It can, therefore, be concluded that the fat rising in dahi does not depend upon the surface area of dahi. On the other hand there is a relation between the percentage distribution of fat and the depth of milk kept for dahi setting. As the depth dec- reases the percentage of fat in the top layer progressively increases irrespective of the surface area, with the result that up to 90.0 per cent of the total fat could be recovered in the top quarter layer. When the depth of milk kept for dahi making was 9 cm. the percentage dis- tribution for the top layer was found to be 52.7, 21.0, 18.6, and 6.8 respectively. But when this depth was only 6 cm. the distribution of the same was 63.4, 19.6, 13.3, and 3.5 res- pectively. When the depth was still further reduced to 3 cm, the top layer contained 89.9, second layer 6.3, third layer 2.5 and bottom layer 1.2 per cent of the total fat in the curds. Thus, if two layers from the top are taken into consideration about 96.2 per cent of the total fat could be recovered without disturbing the last two bottom layers. This means that only the top half layer of dahi could be utilized if butter is to be made by the desi method and the amount of material for churning could thus be reduced to half which would ultimately mean a saving of labour and time. Effect of added substances to milk on the fat distribution in dahi Rahn [1921] found that when the viscosity of milk was increased, the rate of creaming instead of slowing down was actually accelerated. An addition of gelatin causes a quick cream-rise, a thicker cream layer and a much more complete separation of fat as cream, in spite of the fact that the viscosity exceeds the maximum of normal milk (2.4). The ad- dition of crystalloids like sugar delays creaming whereas the addition of colloids like gum arabic, peptone and albumin accelerates creaming. Dam and Sirks [1922] found that addi- tion of colloids like starch, gelatin and gum tragacanth to milk gave a 15 to 25 per cent increase in the volume of cream. Hammer [1916] added viscogen and found very deep cream layers, often extending nearly to the bottom of the creaming cylinder. But all these authors refer only to milk or cream and no work appears to have been done on the effect of added substances on the ascent of fat in dahi. In the present investigation the effect of colloids and crystalloids on the percentage of distribution of fat in dahi was investigated.
C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 61 Milk (250 ml.) was boiled in a vessel (degchi) with the required amount of various sub- stances, cooled down to 98°F and brought to the original volume by the addition of water. The samples of milk containing the various added substances were then inoculated and transferred to glass containers to a known height (9 cm.). One sample of boiled, cooled and inoculated milk was used as control. Agar agar 0.1 and 0.2 per cent, gelation 0.5 per cent, starch 0.5 per cent and cane sugar 0.5 and 1.0 per cent were tried. The results ob- tained are presented in Table VII.

This definitely shows that colloids accelerate the ascent of fat during the setting of dahi, The crystalloids on the other hand depress the fat ascent in dahi. The agar agar always
62 Distribution of Pat in Dahi gives a firmer curd and a richer looking product. This procedure of adding agar agar is generally followed in the preparation of certain commercial products especially in Bengal. In another experiment dahi was made in mud pots 9 in. depth holding 40 lb. of milk with 0.1 per cent agar agar. The top quarter layer was removed and churned accord- ing to the desi method. Six trials were conducted. Sixty eight per cent of the total fat was recovered in the top quarter layer as butter. When the second quarter was also taken for churning 79.6 per cent of the total fat was recovered. Thus, it is clear that, if agar agar is added to milk before boiling the volume of curd to be churned, and consequently the labour involved could be reduced by half without affecting the yield of butter to a consider- able extent. Effect of temperature on the distribution of fat in dahi In order to verify to what extent stirring of milk before coagulation set in affected the distribution of fat in dahi, milk was boiled and after inoculation placed in a glass container to a depth of 9 cm. and kept at 98°F. One sample was kept at room temperature as control. A third sample was kept at 98°F. with starter added to it at the rate of 10 per cent. The depth of dahi was kept the same in all cases. After 12 hours the dahi was separated into four equal layers and the fat percentage determined. Buffalo milk was used and six trials were conducted. The results obtained are presented in Table VIII.

It also indicates that using more starter, and thereby shortening the time of coagulation, has no effect in supress- ing the ascent of fat in dahi. Effect of stirring on the distribution of fat in dahi To study the effect of stirring on the distribution of fat in dahi the following experi- ments were conducted. Boiled buffalo milk was cooled to 98°F., inoculated with starter at the rate of 5 per cent and placed in four containers to an exact depth of 9 cm. These con- tainers were kept at 98°F. One of the containers was kept as a control without disturbing.
C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 63 The second, third and the fourth containers were stirred well with a glass rod one and a half, two and three hours respectively after inoculation. After this, the samples were allowed to remain in the incubator undisturbed for 12 hours and were then separated into four equal layers and analysed for fat. Six trials were conducted and the results obtained are presented in Table IX. The data in Table IX indicates clearly that stirring the product two or three hours after inoculation brings about a better uniformity in the distribution of fat in different layers. In samples stirred one and a half hours after inoculation, the fat percentage of the top layer was generally more than those stirred two or three hours after inoculation. In all the above samples visible coagulation was observed only 4.5 to 5.5 hours after in- oculation. The effect of stirring four hours after inoculation on the distribution of fat in different layers was also investigated. Three trials were conducted using boiled cow milk and the results obtained are presented in Table X.

The stirring before coagulation effects an uniform distribution of fat in different layers and the coagulated mass prevents the fat globules from moving upwards. The texture of dahi is not very much altered by the stirring within four hours of the inoculation. The dahi kept for sale should have an uniform composition and if this is to be insisted upon, the best procedure would be to stir the mass of milk four hours after inoculation and then to keep it overnight when a fairly uniform composition could be achieved. SUMMARY During the formation of dahi butterfat has a tendency to rise and concentrate in the top quarter layer. This phenomenon is somewhat similar to the fat rising in milk or cream. When the depth of milk kept for dahi making was 9 cm. as in the experiments reported in the paper the top, second, third and bottom layers were found to contain about 49.0, 23.5, 19.9 and 7.6 per cent respectively of the total fat. When the depth of milk kept for dahi making was the same there was no difference between dahi from pasteurized or boiled milk, whether of cow or buffalo, as far as the percent- age distribution of fat was concerned. The dahi obtained from raw milk was generally loose in texture and therefore there was more fat rising in raw milk as compared to that in boiled milk. The depth of milk kept for dahi making remaining the same the surface area of dahi had no effect on the fat distribution. There was definite relationship between the depth of dahi and the upward movement of fat. As the depth of milk kept for dahi making decreased the percentage of fat in the top layer increased, irrespective of the surface area, with the result that even up to 90.0 per cent of the total fat could be recovered in the top quarter layer when the depth of the column kept for dahi setting was 3 cm. The addition of colloids like agar agar to milk before the addition of starter appreciably accelerated creaming in dahi, whereas crystalloids like cane sugar delay creaming. It was found that by incorporating agar agar in milk for the indigenous method of butter making, about 80.0 per cent of the total butter fat could be recovered from the top layer of the curd. A fairly uniform distribution of fat in dahi could be secured if dahi is stirred within three to four hours after inoculation of the milk with the starter culture. REFERENCES Dam and Sirks (1922).

STUDIES ON THE METHODS OF PREPARATION OF GHEE* I. ACIDITY IN GHEE By K. S. RANGAPPA and B. N. BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institutue of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 13 November 1945.) ACIDITY in butter fat or ghee is responsible for a number of undesirable changes in it, and should be prevented or reduced to a minimum. Unfortunately, however, in the pre- paration of butter and ghee by the indigenous process (curd process) or the creamery process, souring takes place, and this gives rise to the incorporation of acids in butter and ghee. The souring is practised as it imparts certain desirable properties to butter and ghee, such as taste, flavour and the like. Butter and ghee can be made directly from milk without souring or without any acids developing in them [Banerjee and Doctor, 1938], but such products taste like granulated oil with a slight milky flavour and do not possess any of the valuable pro- perties for which butter or ghee is prized. Lately, in Western countries, neutralization of cream after souring is being resorted to in order to produce low acid butter. Nothing is done, however, in the indigenous process to reduce acidity, or minimize the effect of acidity in ghee. In this paper only the role of acidity in ghee or butter, by the desi (curd) process has been studied. Acidity is developed in two ways ; first it develops during the process of manufacture from milk to ghee, and secondly in course of storage before consumption. A number of factors come into play in the two processes of the development of acidity. There is a third factor which develops acidity in butter or ghee lipase, present in milk, and microflora of souring or of contamination ; but this part of the subject is reserved for a separate study and is not included in the present one. Microflora present in milk from the time of milking to the time of processing produce acids in milk. This is a preventible factor ; and if the healthy practice of sterilizing or boil- ing milk as soon as possible after milking is followed, this defect can be removed. Besides, this is an important item in the problem of supply of clean and healthy milk and is therefore omitted from this study. Generally, milk is processed by boiling to reduce microbial damage. There is, still, a lapse of time between the process of boiling and seeding with curd for souring. In the process of souring, a number of factors come into play ; the length of souring, temperature, microflora, acidity and quantity of seed curd. Without entering into the study of the souring process the formation of acidity during souring has been recorded in a number of expriments to follow up the development of acidity in curd, butter, ghee and its control. Acidity development in souring and manufacture In order to study this factor, milk obtained within two hours of milking from a dairy was heated in an autoclave for 20 minutes, cooled, and then incubated with seed curd. Buffalo milk was used, and its fat content varied from 7.0 to 8.5 per cent. The quantity of seed curd added was 2.5 per cent and its acidity, about 1.4 per cent. lactic acid. The seed curd was maintained in the laboratory from day to day inoculations in culture tubes. The acidity of the milk to start with was 0.09 to 0.11 per cent lactic acid. Two litres of milk were soured at 24°C., 30°C., 35°C., 40°C., and 45°C. At the end of 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours samples were drawn, and the acidity of the curd determined. Ten cubic centimeters of homogeneous- ly mixed curd was mixed with 10 c. c. of water and titrated against N/10 NaOH with phenolphthalene as an indicator. The curd was then churned in a domestic bottle churn to prepare butter. Wäter was added from time to time equal to the volume of the curd for separation of the fat. The butter was washed three times with twice its volume of water, and then its acid value was determined. Ghee was prepared from the butter in *In this paper the quality and constants of ghee are expressed as follows :66 Methods of Preparation of Ghee two ways, the decantation process and the boiling process. In the former process the butter was maintained for about an hour at 100°C. in an electric oven when scum, fat and butter-milk separated in three clear layers. The clear fat layer was separated and heated to 110°C. for five minutes to remove the adhering moisture. In the latter process the butter was heated on a low flame till all the moisture was driven off and filtered to remove casein particles. Acidity, colour, flavour, peroxide value, [Wheeler, 1932], vitamin A and carotene content of ghee were determined. The results are given in Table I.

S. RANGAPPA AND B. N. BANNERJEE 69 OBSERVATIONS (a) Acidity. Acidity increases on storage, but in well-made ghee from healthy animals the rise is too small to impair its quality. Except in the one-year old sample from Kirkee, (and this may be due to some lapse in the process of manufacture), the acidity rise is kept down to well below 1.5 per cent oleic acid. Porbunder samples represent ghee poor in carotene and vitamin A content with its corresponding property. If these results are compared with those of Sen Gupta * the importance of the quality of milk in the manufacture of ghee and its acidity is brought out, He has stored for six months two samples of cow ghee of acid value 1.0 to 1.5, buffalo ghee of acid value 2.8 and mixed ghee of acid value 0.9 (all bazaar samples, no source is mentioned) and found the rise to be 1.5, 2.0, 4.6 and 2.1 acid value respectively, which rendered them useless for analytical purpose or .for consumption. (The acid value is about twice the corresponding number, expressed as percentage of oleic acid). (b) H-ion concentration. The H-ion of ghee is not usually determined.

BANNRJEE 71 About 10 lb. of bazaar ghee of acidity 4.3 per cent oleic acid were bought from the market and used in the experiments. On a laboratory scale the choice of a proper alkali and its strength were determined in the following way. Caustic soda 0.16 N, hot and cold, 16 N and 3.2 N, ammonia 0.1 N, hot and cold, 1.6 N, and 3.2 N, sodium carbonate 0.16 N, hot and cold, 1.6 N, and 3.2 N, and caustic lime in saturated solution, paste and in cream form were tried. The neutralizations were effected in the following manner: (a) The calculated quantity of alkali was added in bulk, mixed and washed with hot water. (b) The calculated quantity of alkali was added in four to six instalments, mixed, washed each time and finally the adhering soap was washed off. (c) Ghee was first washed with hot water two or three times and then the acidity was neutralized as in (b) above. (d) The calculated quantity of alkali was added in bulk, and the whole maintained at about 60° to 70°C. for about six hours, the soap run off and washed. Ghee was washed with hot water at about 90°C., so that, on cooling during the process, the temperature of the mass was not below 60°C. Due to emulsification it was found that there was a residual acidity when the calculated quantity of alkali was added. An excess of alkali over the calculated amount was always necessary to completely neutralize the acidity. The results are given in a tabular (Table IV) form with the effect of the treatment on the colour, flavour, and texture of ghee.

This fact has been observed in the case of cream neutralization as well. An alkali strength, one part of which neutralizes the free fatty acids in 10 parts of ghee, works best. Caustic soda works better than the other alkalies tried. It is better to add the neutralizer in 4 to 6 instalments than in one and wash each time with water about twice the volume of ghee. Finally, ghee should be washed thoroughly until the fat clears up into a clear yellow liquid. Vigorous agitation should be avoided and sufficient time should be allowed for the wash water to drain to the bottom of the vessel. In a test case 1450 gm. of ghee of acidity 4.2 per cent oleic acid, were neutralized as described above. The neutralized ghee weighed 1350 gm. and was of acidity 0.4 per cent oleic acid. The time taken was 6½ hours and 18 litres of water were used. The process resulted in a loss of 100 gm. of which 61 gm. were free fatty acids calculated as oleic acid, Two more samples from Peshawar were similarly treated and the effect of the process on the carotene, vitamin A, R. M. and saponification value were determined. The results are given in Table IV. High acid ghee can thus be neutralized, and a product of better quality made. The fat loss is not high but the carotene and vitamin A contents are partly lost. Other con- stants of ghee are not much affected. Colour and texture are improved but not the flavour. Ghee that would otherwise be unfit for use can be recovered in this way. REFERENCES Banerjee and Doctor (1938). Agric. and Live Stk. India 8, 158 Davies(194l ). J. Indian Chem.

BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 13 November 1945) (With four text figures) PROCESSING OF MILK WHILE the problems of production and handling of milk are outside the scope of ghee manufacture, still, in a country like India, with a tropical climate and inadequate com- munication, it is important that milk should be produced with as little contamination as possible in order to ensure storage quality. Otherwise there is a grave risk of souring and spoilage. A sour and spoilt milk cannot be expected to give a sweet curd nor a fine butter and ghee. Butter and ghee, made in summer and rainy seasons, are generally bad and of poor quality. In a tropical climate the temperature seriously affects the keeping quality of the product. It has been found that milk stored at 100° F. will only keep sweet for about quarter of the time of milk kept at 60° F. [Wright, 1937]. It follows that under Indian conditions, any processing of milk, which may be necessary, should take place as soon as possible after production. While as a result of ignorance and poverty of gowalas and farmers milk is not produced in a clean condition still, in India, the problem of milk-borne disease does not arise. This is due to the almost universal custom of boiling the milk before it is consumed. This does not mean that all milk is sold or used only after boiling. However, by processing the maximum of germ destruction with a minimum of heat flavour is what is aimed at. Modern processing methods, based on heat treatment or on refrigeration or both, add to the costs of milk. The existing types of equipment are expensive and are not designed to 'In this paper the quality and constants of ghee are expressed as follows : 1.

M. R. SRINIVASAN AND B. N. BANERJEE 73 meet the needs of a primitive village producer. We were, therefore, left with the problem of finding out the temperature and time of boiling of milk that would suit Indian conditions. Milk was heated to boiling in the villager's vessel (curd pot) and the bacterial count was noted as also the quality of the resultant curd and ghee. Experimental. Processing of milk by boiling was tried in the following way : heating milk to boiling point and continuing boiling for five and ten minutes as also boiling of milk till the volume was reduced by 5 and 10 per cent. Villagers can judge the temperature from ebullition time by counting from 1 to 100 for a minute, and evaporation loss from reduction in volume. Fresh buffalo milk from a nearby dairy was used for the experiments. Its acidity, fat and lactose contents were determined. Its bacterial content as determined by plating method was found to be 1,20,000 per c. c. The milk was then boiled (96°C. at 3,000 ft. above sea level) in an open aluminium vessel for five and ten minutes, cooled and plated for bacterial count. In another trial, 4.4 litres and 4.2 litres of fresh buffalo milk (bacterial count, 1,25,000) were heated to boiling and maintained at that temperature till the volume was reduced to 4 litres. The reduction in bacterial count in each case is recorded in Table I. TABLE I Variation of bacterial count with processing Raw milk count per c. c.

Milk is usually boiled for a short time and then allowed to cool ; while still lukewarm, a small quantity of the pre- vious day's supply is put in for souring. The inoculum is required to be a lactic acid starter. At present little information is available regarding the types of lactic acid bac- teria used in the preparation of dahi in different areas, nor is anything known of the relation of the types of organisms to the flavour and texture of the products dahi, butter and ghee, [Karnad, 1939; Joshi and Ram Ayyar, 1936 ; Ram Ayyar, 1928 Madhok and Kapoor, 1942]. The variety of microflora in the seed curd and its relation to palatability and other qualities of the products under the present conditions of production is not known. The manufacture of dahi is of outstanding importance either as food, or as the intermediate product in ghee manufacture. Starters used in the case of creamery butter have been extensively studied in other parts where butter is produced under scientifically controlled conditions. Starters or bacterial cultures used for souring cream increase in butter the desired flavour and aroma. A good starter is clean sour milk or curd (natural), while pure culture starters are mixtures of strains of desirable bacteriaM. R. SRINIVASAN AND B. N.

Therefore the Indian fermented products are of uncertain flavour and composition, quality, palatability, etc. In studying the souring process of dahi for ghee manufacture, the changes taking place in the lactose content of milk have been recorded together with other changes in a general way. Seed curd propagated in the laboratory having a firm texture and sweet flavour has only been used in the amounts of 2.5 per cent by volume and with the acidity of 1 to 1.4 per cent, and lactose content of 3.5 per cent. Since the temperature at which souring is generally carried out varies within a wide range, fermentation has been studied at a number of temperatures to include all the seasons of the year. Souring has been carried on with a pure culture of Acidophilus lactobacillus for comparison with that of a mixed flora seed curd. Results obtained from other studies in souring have been borne in mind in drawing conclusions. (Refer to table in Part I; seed curd tables and pure culture tables in Part II; acidity tables of village method of prepara. tion of ghee in Part III.) Experiment. Buffalo milk has been used for the experiments. The acidity of fresh milk varied from 0.07 to 0.09 per cent lactic acid, lactose content between 4.4 and 4.8 per cent, and pH 6.4 to 6.9. Half a litre of milk was sterilized for 60 minutes in steam, cooled down, seeded with 2½ per cent of seed curd of firm texture and sweet flavour for souring studies. Souring experiments were carried out at temperatures of 6°-8°C., and at 10°, 17°, 25°, 30°, 35°, 40° and 45°C. Samples were taken out at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours. In the case of the cold temperature studies samples were taken up to 96 hours and at longer intervals as the rate of souring was slow. The pH, lactose content, and acidity were determined as before. Lactic acid was determined according to Friedman et al. [1930], Well mixed curd 10 c. c. in quantity was diluted to 500 c. c. with distilled water and warmed to 40°-50°C. when the casein coagulated in lumps. Then the solution was filtered and 10 c. c. of the filtrate was extracted thrice with 30 c. c. of ether. Ether was evaporated off from the combined ether extracts and the acid left behind was estimated by oxidation to acetaldehyde and trapped in bisulphite solution. The results are given in Tables, IV, V and VI. TABLE IV Souring with pure culture Time of incubation hours Total acidity Lactose Lactic acid Ratio of lactic to total acid per cent Pure culture 33°C.

Lactose used and acidity developed at temperatures of 24°C., 30°C. and 45°C. with mixed flora (seed curd) Discussion. The H ion of the curd falls steadily with souring and stops at pH 4.4; there it remains stationary, though the acidity goes on increasing with time. The acidity of curd increases with the time of souring and the rate is higher as the temperature is higher. But below 20°C. the rate of increase of acidity in curd slows down very much, so that at about 10°C. the souring process is very slow and requires artificial heating to complete the process of curdling within reasonable limits of time. In cold winter days, therefore, it is the practice in the Indian household to warm the souring vessel by keeping it near the kitchen fire. The rise of acidity is regular up to about 1 per cent, and then it slows down. With pure culture of Acidophilus lactobacillus the rise of acidity is up to 1.4 per cent, and then it stops. With a mixed flora the rise in acidity does not stop but continues until half the lactose content of milk is used up. By that time putrefaction sets in and the curd is unfit for consumption. The ratio of lactic acidity to total acidity is unity up to 0.6 per cent acidity of the curd, and thereafter it makes up about 90 per cent in the case of pure cultures, 80 per cent in the case
82 Methods of Preparaiion of Ghee of good seed curd, and less with a mixed flora [Suzuki, Hastings and Hart, 1910]. Lactic acidity does not rise more than 1.25 per cent with pure cultures, and 1.4 per cent with mixed flora. This is shown graphically in Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Acidophilus as inocculum at temperatures of 40°C, and 33°C. The rise in acidity and lactose loss in curd is a measure of the nature of the souring process. The resultant butter on churning carries with it the products of souring, the acidity, flavour, texture, etc. The texture of the curd (slimy, ropy, uniformly firm) determines the quality of the curd and of the butter. The presence or absence of gas bubbles or cracks in the mass of the curd denotes the activity of gas-forming bacteria. A sweet aromatic flavour indicates a good souring process and its absence the activity of undesirable microflora. Acidity of butter from properly soured curd is about 0.2 per cent lactic acid or less. Any rise in acidity above this figure indicates unsatisfactory souring and lipolysis of butterfat.
M. R. SRINIVASAN AND B. N. BANERJEE 83 Again the acidity of ghee compared to butter on clarification provides a picture of the acid developed in the souring process. Acidity of ghee on clarification by the boiling process should be about 0.0584 Methods of Preparation of Ghee adulteration. Therefore, it is exported and sold as butter to the consumer. The consumer melts the butter into ghee before use or storage. The animals are milked twice a day. The times of milking are soon after sunrise (5 to 7 a.m.) and sunset (7 to 9 p. m.). Tinned brass, or similar metallic vessels are used for drawing milk. Samples of raw milk were taken immediately after the milking was over. Acidity was determined without delay at the spot. Milk is not processed for butter making. In the evening it is seeded with half to one ounce of buttermilk from the previous batch. The volume of seed curd remains the same irrespective of the quantity of milk or season The interval of time between milking and seeding is one half to two hours. Samples of buttermilk used for seeding were tested for acidity. Souring takes place for 8 to 12 hours over night. Souring is done in an earthen- ware vessel or chatty and the top is covered with a lid. In all houses clay pots are used for this purpose, except in one in which a tinned copper vessel was used. The vessel is only washed after use and may be scrubbed with straw. The morning milk after meeting other demands is seeded, or laid aside, and mixed with evening milk and seeded. Sometimes the morning milk is placed in the clay vessel over the smouldering remains of the kitchen fire after cooking to warm up for one to two hours. The temperature of the milk never exceeded 70°C. in this treatment. Generally, the animals, cattle-shed, housing, milking and souring vessels are very unclean, a condition which calls for better attention and improvement. Even the udders and the milkman's hands are not properly washed before milking. The curd is churned next morning in a village churn for butter. The texture of the curd is ropy with enclosed gas bubbles inside and separated into two layers, the curd on the top, and the serum at the bottom. The flavour is not very sweet. Samples of curd were taken before churning. The volume of water added during churning depends on whether it is to be used by the farmer or offered for sale. In the former case 25 per cent to 30 per cent of water was added and in the latter case 100 per cent. Butter is never washed after it is taken out of the butter milk. The daily yield of butter is stored in buttermilk, which is changed daily, till it is taken away by the Mandya merchant. The merchant who generally advances money to the villager sends his agent once a week to collect the butter from the villager's home. Samples of butter were taken immediately after churning. In villages wherever possible control experiments were carried out under identical conditions using only the villager's vessels and equipment. The only difference was that milk was boiled for five minutes in the clay vessel in which it was to be soured and seeded with 2½ per cent laboratory seed curd. Curds in the control experiments were invariably better in flavour, firm and uniform in texture and there was no separation of the solid and liquid layers. The butter was melted into ghee immediately by the desi boiling off and decantation processes. The results are given in Table I. Storage of butter. As mentioned before the practice in Mandya taluk for butter collectors is to go round the villages with old kerosene tins to collect butter once a week from house to house. They in turn sell or hand it over to merchants in Mandya Town. The Mandya merchant sends it at once by rail to Bangalore. Therefore, the stocks with Mandya merchant are one to seven days old heterogenous collection of butter. Samples were taken from Mandya merchants just before despatch to Bangalore (Table II). The Bangalore retailer in his turn offers Mandya butter for sale and stocks it in his shop. He retains it for sale so long as the colour and flavour are not bad. It is then melted into ghee and sold as such. This length of time was found to be 10 days. Three samples of butter prepared in the Bilideglu village including the control were stored in three small tins for six days and analysed fresh, after three and six days. A portion of it was boiled at each stage into ghee and analysed. This represents the effect of storage on butter from the manufacturer to collector at Mandya (Table III). In another trial Mandya butter as stored in a Bangalore retailer's shop was taken every third day till they were 17 days old and analysed. This tin had just arrived in Bangalore and was six days old from the date of manufacture. Another control sample of butter prepared as before was placed side by side in the shop in a tin that was open in the day time and covered up in the night as is the practice. Butter samples were boiled into ghee and analysed. (Table IV). The temperature varied during this period from 24°C. to 27°C. The induction period of ghee from, the first and last samples were determined. The vitamin A content of ghee from stored butter was determined in the above set to find out the effect of the procedure (Table IV and Fig. 1).

The temperature then ranged between 20° and 24°C. and the animals were being fed on the freely available green herbage. There was no change in the method of preparation of butter due to season, except that in the village of Kothathi the time of souring was increased to 24 hours as against 12 hours in summer. Experiment. Pooled milk was divided into three villager's pots and treated in the same way as is the practice in the village. In Kothathi, milk was collected in the morning, and in Bilideglu, in the evening. The milk in two of the pots was boiled for 10 minutes, and that in the third was left unpro. cessed. One lot of boiled milk was seeded with the curd obtained from boiled milk. The other two lots were seeded with the village seed. The Bilideglu samples were soured for 10 hours and those of Kothathi for 24 hours, and then the butter was churned out and melted into ghee by the boiling off and decantation methods. Portions of butter samples were stored for three and seven days and analysed for acidity and storage property. The results are given in Tables V and VI. Bazaar samples were not collected this time as it was found that the collections were being sent away to Bangalore the same day, without any storage in Mandya. Observations. The quality of curd is about the same as in summer except that there was no gas bubbles in the mass of curd which was lump like in texture. The acidity developed and lactose consumed is lower than before. This is due to the lower temperature prevailing in the season but is complicated by the use of uncontrolled seed curd. Thus in Kothathi, where the seed had deteriorated, though the time of souring is double, the acid development is not as high as before. Again, there is a higher destruction of lactose as com- pared to the rise in acidity. A study of curd, butter and ghee acidities points to undesirable lipolysis in the souring pro- cess. Though the acidity in the ghee is less than in summer, the storage property is not satisfactory. Want of predomi. nance of lactic acid bacteria in the seed curd and development of lipolytic flora is clearly indicated in the results. In the end, the winter curd, butter, and ghee, though expected to be much superior to the summer samples, are only slightly better. This is due to the use of unprocessed milk, bad seed curd, and to the defective souring process. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Rise in acidity on storage of butter from boiled and unprocessed milk. PREPARATION OF ghee IN KODURU, OUDDAPPAH DISTRICT Koduru, where laboratory facilities were available, was chosen for the investigation in Cuddappah district. Ghee alone is sold in this area, and only buffalo milk is used in its preparation. The animals are poor milkers (3 to 5 1b.) and so are milked only once a day.

Souring takes place for 20-22 hours for the morning batch and 10.12 hours for the evening. The morning and evening curds are mixed up the following morning and then churned. Usually the curd is very sour in flavour but has a firm texture. The volume of water added during churning varied from 100-200 per cent. The daily yield of butter is accumulated in dry aluminium or tinned-brass vessels until a quantity enough to yield half to one seer of ghee is gathered. The collected butter is then washed once or twice with water and melted into ghee. Butter is boiled over a low fire in tinned-brass vessels until the crackling sound stops. In some houses the boiling is continued until the casein gets blackened. The maximum temperature varied from 130°C.- 145°C. There was not much difference in the texture of the control curd and that of the village, but the flavour was very sour in the case of the village samples. Butter used for ghee-making in this area is about one to seven days old. During these investigations the temperature was 48°C.-38°C. PREPARATION OF ghee IN HOGENICAL, NORTH SALEM FOREST DIVISION In the Madras Presidency there are certain areas in the forest divisions where very large herds of cattle are maintained. Herds of 600-1500 animals are kept in different blocks very near to Hogenical in the Cauvery River valley, (70 miles by the nearest rail head and 30 miles from the taluk centre). In this area cows are the only milch animal reared. These animals live only on the grass, tender green leaves and twigs available in the forest, and get no concentrate as food. They represent typical hill cattle (Kangayam breed), thin, stunted in size, very poor milkers, not very well-fed or looked after. The cows yield 2-3 lb. of milk per day and are milked only once in the morning between 6 and 8 a.m. The milking is done in earthen vessels. Milk is usually processed as follows for making curd, butter and ghee, the only milk pro- ducts made in this area. Fresh milk within 1-2 hours after milking is brought to boil vigorously and then allowed to remain over the smouldering remains of the kitchen fire, when a thick layer of skin is formed on the top. The milk remains hot on the fire till even- ing, when it is removed and allowed to cool. The boiling is done in an earthen chatti, which is daily cleaned by boiling water in it. It is seeded with 1-2 oz. of butter milk in the evening. The most noteworthy point observed in this area is that milk is vigorously boiled, till a thick skin forms on the top, and also that it is maintained hot for the whole day. Another point is that the souring vessel is sterilized every day by boiling water in it. If this was not done, it was reported, the curd developed an undesirable flavour. Milk is usually soured for 10-12 hours in the night and churned early in the morning. The texture of the curd is firm and the flavour sweet and good. The volume of water added during churning varied usually from 50 to 100 per cent of the volume of the curd. Butter thus obtained is usually stored for anything from 7 to 15 days in earthen chatties. When a quantity sufficient to yield half a seer or more of ghee is collected, the butter is melted into ghee over a controlled fire by boiling until the crackling sound stops. As the method of processing milk followed in these parts gave perfectly satisfactory sterilization of milk and the time of souring milk was also normal, no control experiment was conducted. Certain very remarkable observations were made in this area. Though the cattle owners are very poor and ignorant, and live far away from civilisation without any outside help or expert advice they make first class curd and butter. In their own way they are sterilizing milk to a thoroughly satisfactory stage, maintain the quality till it is seeded and do not sour it longer than circumstances require. One cannot but admire their obser- vation that unless the souring vessel (earthenware) is washed thoroughly by boiling water in it every day, the curd obtained is liable to go bad. As a matter of fact except for a faint barn or smoky flavour, there was no other defect in the samples of their curd examin- ed by us. The lactose lost and acidity development pointed to an almost pure lactic fer- mentation. Butter and ghee acidities were as low as could be desired. The colour, flavour and texture of butter and ghee were the best seen in the Madras Presidency. The caro- tenoid pigment of the butter and ghee were the highest recorded, and the flavour of the ghee the best and sweetest recorded by us. The quality is also reflected in the induction period, the R. M. value, P. V., I. V., and the saponification value, This observation emphasizes the important relation between feed, storage property, colour, vitamin A and flavour of butter and ghee. The only serious defect was that the butter was stored in used earthenware vessels for a long time instead of being melted into ghee at once, and this brought about degradation in the quality and property of both butter and ghee. The practice is due to the

PREPARATION OF GHEE IN DHINOJ, BARODA* Dhinoj is situated in north Gujerat. It is an important ghee centre in the Baroda state (Mehsana district.) Large quantities of ghee are collected, refined and exported from this place. It has also a large population of some of the best buffaloes of Gujerat. Samples were taken and experiments were carried out in Dhinoj proper. Butter as such is not prepared, sold or consumed in this area ; and hence in a few hours after churning, butter is usually melted into ghee. The animals are milked twice a day, at 7 or 7-30 a.m., and at about the same hour in the evening. Untinned brass vessels are invariably used for drawing milk. Samples were taken immediately after milking, and the acidity and lactose determined. Milk is neither heat-treated nor processed in any way, nor even seeded with any starter such as curd or buttermilk. Only in winter, for about three months or so, is any starter used. The morning milk, left over after the household and other demands are met, is kept in an earthen pot and laid aside in a corner or in a cupboard. The evening milk is also poured into the same vessel and allowed to curdle. The milk curdles in about 10 hours at a room temperature of 33°-35°C. The same process is followed on the second day in a separate pot. The curd is churned on the third day early in the morning, between 4 and 5 a.m., by the usual village method. The texture of the curd is generally gassy, with a solid crust on the surface and some serum at the bottom. The flavour and taste are sharply acid but not unpleasant. The curd in the case of the control sample, though mild in taste and flavour as compared to other samples, was slightly lumpy. At the commencement of the churning no water is added, but when the curd is about to break, cold water about equal in volume to that of the curd is added. The butter is not washed, but it is melted over a very low fire into ghee within 2-3 hours after churning. During the process the butterfat or ghee does not boil, care being taken to see that the casein does not get charred but retains a white colour. The degree of heating butter for conversion into ghee varies with different agricultural communities. The Anjanas or the Chowdharies see that the butterfat does not boil and that the casein remains white ; with the Patidars, the scum or casein takes up a light brown tint; with the Thakardas, it becomes dark brown and the ghee takes on a cooked flavour. The earthenware used in the process is first scrubbed with hot water and a rag and then steamed for about 10-15 minutes by inverting it over a small brass vessel in which water is kept boiling over a fire. The cleanliness of the cattle, housing, milking and other processes left much to be desired. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory following the Dhinoj practice of using unprocessed milk and allowing the milk to sour by itself for two days. Even if ghee be prepared by the decantation process, there is a partial loss of vitamin A and great reduction in storage property (induction period).

S. RANGAPPA AND B. N. BANERJEE 99 Experience of many a century has shown that in cold countries butter could be made, stored, and consumed as such ; but in hot countries butter must be clarified into ghee or sanne (the Egyptian equivalent of ghee) for storage and consumption. Nowadays even in cold countries, for export and storage, there is a tendency to dehydrate butter to prevent rancidity and then to homogenize it into butter again before consumption. It is a pity that, due to ignorance and other causes, milk fat should be stored or consumed in India in a form other than ghee. The following causes are responsible for the development of rancidity in butter on storage and the resultant ghee. It is well known that oils and fats are prone to develop rancidity ; and in the case of butter the following five causes play their part :100 Methods of Preparation of Ghee a comparison of the acidity of butter and ghee made by the boiling and decantation process is very significant. It has been found that butter acidity is about twice as high as ghee acidity made by the boiling process and at least four times higher than that of ghee by the decantation process*. Even with curd acidity as high as 2.8 per cent lactic and butter acidity, 0.28 per cent, the ghee acidity by the decantation process is only 0.06 per cent. The acidity of village ghee of Mandya, Kodur, Guntur and Hogenical are all high; this point is brought out from experiments carried out on storage of butter before being melted into gheet. While in ghee melted from fresh butter the ratio of acidity is at least 4: 1 by the decantation process, in the case of stored butter the ratio is reduced to 1 : 1 or 1 : 0.09. This demonstrates that the high acidity is due to the breakdown of the fatty acid glycerides. It is, therefore, necessary to study this increase of acidity in butter and ghee due to storage of butter, before its clarification into ghee. This also raises the point as to when and how butter should be clarified under village conditions. Apart from the factors mentioned before lipase of milk (in the case of butter made from unboiled milk) and that from microflora (milk and seed curd) are mostly responsible for this increase of acidity. Acidity in butter due to souring also autocatalytically saponifies the butter. Experiments were therefore designed to study the effect of these factors separately. Infection can be killed by adding formalin to butter, which will not affect adversely the catalytic activity of free acids or the activity of lipolytic enzymes. Again, sterilization stops the enzyme action, but not the effect of acidity. In this way the effect of each of the three factors can be deduced. Experimental. A number of trials were performed to find out the amount of formalin necessary to stop bacterial growth. Addition of 5 per cent by volume of formalin to curd before churning did not incorporate it sufficiently in the resulting butter to stop bacterial growth in it for more than three days at 37°C. Sterility was tested by seeding butter in milk agar in sterile petri dishes and incubating them at 37°C. It was found that 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 c. c. formalin in 100 gm. of butter kept down bacterial growth for 3 to 5, 6 to 8 and over 15 days respectively. Butter with 2 to 3 c. c. formalin remained sterile for all pur- poses. Formalin was added to butter in the molten condition (40°C). It was mixed thorough- ly and then allowed to set. Eight litres of unboiled buffalo milk were seeded with 50 c. c. of unboiled milk seed curd of 1.2 per cent lactic acidity in an earthen pot of about 20 litres, as is the practice in villages. The seed curd was specially propagated in unboiled milk from a sample of butter from Mandya village that had been obtained from untreated milk. The flavour of the seed curd was non-aromatic and it was slightly mouldy. After 24 hours of souring the acidity was 1.2 per cent when it was churned. The temperature varied during the experiment between 20° and 28°C. The resulting butter was used as a stock for the experiments. Fifty-gram samples (two) from the stock butter were transferred to 250 c. c. conical flasks and one was treated with formalin and the other sterilized. Sterilization was effected in steam at 100°C. for one hour for three days. The flasks were all plugged with cotton wool and maintained at 30°C. It was found that at 37°C. the acidities developed were irre- gular as the fat and aqueous layers separated out. The H-ion and acidity of the stock butter were determined when it was made. Then, after 4, 7, 14 and 21 days samples were drawn from the stock and the experiment repeated as described above. Acidity and H-ion determinations of the samples were made at every interval. The acidity of the sterilized samples were determined only at the beginning and end of the storage period of 21 days, A sample of unprocessed-milk butter bought from the bazaar was similarly treated and experimented with. The results are given in Table II and are represented graphically in Fig. 1. Again, unwashed butter contains about 14 per cent milk serum or buttermilk. On storage the protein content of butter may undergo decomposition and give rise to a putrid smell, but the smell may not always be evident. During the process of decomposition the insoluble protein is converted into the water-soluble non-protein nitrogen. The latter was, therefore, determined in butter at the beginning and at intervals of storage. The determina- tion was made with a slight modification of Ling's method [1940]. The protein content is coagulated with trichloracetic acid at 70°C. and the soluble protein extracted with water after cooling. The increase in the percentage nitrogen content of the extract, if any, in- dicates the extent of decomposition of the protein in the butter. *See Studies on the method of preparation of ghee, 1.

Lipase activity in unprocessed-milk (Mandya) butter. The rise of acidity in butter on storage varies with the seasonal temperature and flora. The addition of formalin does not increase the initial acidity of butter. But sterilization increases the initial acidity slightly and the increase is more in high acid butters. This is due to the action of heat of sterilization and the free acidity of butter. Growing flora (infection) causes the increase of acidity in butter.

BANERJEE 103 THE EFFECT OF STORAGE VESSELS ON THE KEEPING QUALITY OF GHEE As discussed before, it was felt necessary to compare the changes that would take place when clarified butter was stored under similar conditions. For this purpose, ghee was stored in a villager's earthenware, (an old and used vessel)'that was smeared with butter and ghee, another similar vessel that was heated to 100°C. for 12 hoars to kill the microflora present; a new and unused vessel, and a glass conical flask.

This high acidity makes it unfit for consumption as butter and also ruins the ghee if clarified from stored butter. Under tropical conditions, lipolytic microflora thrive at an alarming rate in unwashed butter prepared from uncontrolled seed culture, unboiled milk or unpasteurized cream, making it unfit for consumption on storage. In cold climates, the growth is not altogether stopped, but the rate of growth is slow enough to permit storage and consumption as butter for a certain length of time. Once lipolysis has taken place in butter, the free fatty acids pass into the ghee on clarification, and it is very difficult to get rid of it. Fortunately for the ghee trade, lipolysis in the milk and curd stages is very small and negligible. But once butter is churned out from curd and the lactic acid solution removed, undesirable microflora have their full play. The total acidity of curd and lactose consumed give a picture of the action of microflora in curd and, to a certain extent, determine the quality of butter, especially its storage property. If butter be at once melted into ghee, then further development of acidity is stopped and a low acid ghee results with good storage property. On neglect, that is, delay in melting butter into ghee, acidity goes on increasing at an increasing rate and it cannot be removed on clarification, and it proportionately shortens the storage property of ghee. High acidity in ghee on storage also destroys vitamin A and carotene B quickly. Acidity in butter, that is not derived from the fat phase, is not markedly harmful to the vitamin A or carotene of butter. Its effect as a catalyst on the development of rancidity in fat, or rise in acidity of butter fat is very little. The slight rise of acidity in ghee on clarification is a measure of this cause. But the free fatty acid in butter or ghee, that is derived from lipolysis, is autocatalytic and is proportional to its strength. However, broadly speaking, the small quantity of free fatty acid that finds its way into butter and ghee, (up to 0.2 per cent in butter and 0.1 per cent in ghee) is not very harmful, and its effect is negligible. This can be achieved if the milk is not soured beyond an acidity of 1.2 per cent and the butter is then churned out and at once melted into ghee by the decantation process, but the same is not true of high acidity in butter or ghee resulting from lipolysis. CAUSATIVE ORGANISM OF HIGH ACIDITY IN MANDYA (UNPROCESSED MILK) BUTTER The investigations on acidity in Mandya butter, described before, showed that lipolytic enzymes elaborated by the uncontrolled microflora of the untreated milk and of the seed curd are almost entirely responsible for the enormously high acidity developed in butter on storage. No attempt had, however, been made to trace the cause to any particular flora, but the fact had been noted that the same butter, when raised to 40°C. K. S. RANGAPPA AND B. N.

EFFECT OF FLUOROSIS ON MINERAL METABOLISM By B. N. MAJUMDAR AND S. N. RAY Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 24 January 1946) IN a previous paper [Majumdar, Ray and Sen, 1943], evidence has been advanced to identify the so-called cases of osteomalacia [Mahajan, 1934-35] and rheumatoid arthritis [Viswanathan, 1934-35] of cattle in India with fluorosis. Symptoms seen in these field cases could be experimentally produced in normal cattle by administering sodium fluo- ride. To study further whether the symptoms produced follow the metabolism in a phos- phorosis, a series of mineral balance studies was carried out and the results are presented in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL The effect of feeding fluorine to animals has been studied in two sets of metabolism trials. In the first set, the animals used consisted of four groups, each containing three adult hills bulls. All these animals were on a low phosphorus basal ration, composed of wheat bhoosa as roughage and a concentrate mixture of groundnut cake and barley. The ani- mals of the first group (control group) received the basal ration only, while those of groups 2 and 3 (respectively called low and high fluorine groups) received in addition 0.1 gm. and 1.0 gm. of sodium fluoride daily per animal. The animals of the final group (henceforth called the calcium group) received in addition to their daily ration, 1 gm. of sodium fluoride and 2 oz. of calcium phosphate. Five months after the experiments had started, the stock of calcium phosphate was exhausted and calcium carbonate was given instead. The basal ration of these animals was so selected as to resemble that given under field conditions in the suspected fluorosis zones. In the second set of metabolism trials, the basal ration was formulated to supply the animals with adequate calcium and phosphorus. It consisted of wheat bhoosa as rough- age and a concentrate mixture of rape-cake and wheat-bran. Four groups, each contain- ing three adult hills bulls, were used, and all the animals received the basal ration sup- plemented with 3 mg. of fluorine per kg. body weight. The first group (fluorine-alone group) received this ration, while the other three groups received in addition 2 oz. cal- cium carbonate (calcium group), 2 oz. sodium phosphate (phosphate group) and 1 oz. alu- minium phosphate (aluminium group), respectively. The last group was included, as some workers [Marcovitch and Stanley, 1942] have reported that aluminium salts protect small animals against fluorosis. The condition of the animals in the first trial has been given in detail in a previous paper [Majumdar et al., 1943]. The animals of the high fluorine group started losing con- dition immediately fluorine feeding was started and died within nine months after show- ing severe symptoms of fluorosis. At this period, the calcium group animals showed definite but much less aggravated symptoms, while the bulls in the other two groups remained quite normal. It may also be mentioned here that the weights of the calcium group animals, after an initial fall, remained steady as long as calcium phosphate was fed, but a month after calcium carbonate was substituted the animals started losing weight rapidly. In contrast to these findings, the animals in the second trial were in much better condition at the end of nine months on the experimental feed. The animals of the 'fluorine-alone' group were showing only mild symptoms of fluorosis, viz. enlargement of hooves and abnormal wearing of the incisors. The animals of the 'phosphate group' also showed similar symptoms, whereas the animals of the aluminium group, though ingesting high doses of fluorine, remained normal in appearance. The weights of animals of these groups remained more or less constant throughout the experiment. The worst sufferers were, however, the animals of the 'calcium group'. These bulls not only ex- hibited the symptoms seen in the other two groups in a more aggravated form, but had also lost weight considerably. The fall in weight started from the seventh month and continued until all the three animals died within 10-11 months after the commencement of the experiment It may be mentioned that, even after two years on the experimental ration, the 'aluminium group' of animals has exhibited only minor symptoms, whereas the animals in the other groups had all died of fluorosis. 107

The results are given in Tables I and II. DISCUSSION It will be seen from Table I that when fluorine is administered in small doses the balance of both calcium and phosphorus improves. This supports recent findings that fluorine in small quantities helps in the prevention of caries. High fluorine intake, how- ever, brings about a definitely negative balance of calcium and the phosphorus balance, already negative, becomes more pronounced. The increased negative balance of phospho- rus is mainly due to the highly increased elimination of this mineral in urine. A simul- taneous greater excretion of nitrogen through the kidneys may be taken to signify ex- tensive muscular degeneration. This breakdown of the soft tissues is also apparent from the great loss in body weight of the animals of the high fluorine group. A simi- lar loss of phosphorus by dairy cattle on fluorine administration was found by Du Toit, et al. [1937] who considered that fluorine produced symptoms of osteomalacia by induc- ing a condition of phosphorus shortage. This hypothesis cannot, however, be substan. tiated in view of our finding that the animals in the fluorine alone group of the second trial were actually in positive phosphorus balance when symptoms of fluorosis were clearly observable. This is further confirmed from the blood anylysis [Majumdar et al. 1943] of the experimental animals, where no lowering of blood inorganic phospho- rus, characteristic of aphosphorosis, could be recorded. In the absence of nitrogen balance data, the possibility of negative phosphorus balance in the animals of Du Toit et al. [1937] being due to the breakdown of soft tissues cannot be ruled out. There seems, however, to be some apparent connection between the level of feed phosphorus and the production of fluorotic symptoms. These symptoms were precipitated in animals kept on a low phosporus diet (first trial) ; but were delayed when adequate phosphorus was supplied (second trial). The effect of the level of intake of phosphorus was very clearly exhibited by the animals of the calcium group in the first set of ex- periments. Here so long as the supplement of calcium phosphate was given, the ani- mals remained in good condition. The supplement helped to maintain the ration adequate in phosphorus. When calcium phosphate was replaced by calcium carbonate, the animals started losing weight and their condition thereafter rapidly deteriorated. These experi- ments apparently support the view of Du Toit et al. [1937] that fluorosis brings about osteoma- lacia by phosphorus deprivation and may be corrected by adequate phosphorus intake. But this contention has been proved untenable from the metabolic evidences already dis cussed. It is not the adequacy of phosphorus alone but that of both calcium and phos- phorus, and also their proper proportion, which can afford some protection against fluo- rosis. It should, however, be stressed that adequate supply of calcium and phosphorus offers only a temporary relief and is useless to save a victim against prolonged high in- take of fluorine. The importance of supplying the minerals in correct proportion is exemplified in the second set of experiments. Here, though the animals were on a negative calcium balance, a supplement of calcium carbonate, instead of proving helpful, brought about more rapid deterioration of the animals. The addition of extra phosphorus, as sodium phosphate, was also of no avail, because the condition of the phosphorus group of ani- mals was more or less the same as that of the animals of the fluorine-alone group. The Ca : P ratios of the control, high fluorine and calcium (calcium phosphate supplement), groups of animals in the first experiment, and of fluorine alone, calcium and phosphorus groups of the animals in the second experiment were respectively 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:1.2, 4.3 : 1 and 1 : 2.2. It will thus be seen that the syndromes of fluorosis were precipitated only in those groups, where either there was a gross deficiency of phosphorus or where the ratios were widely divergent from the physiological optimum range of 2:1 to 1:1. From what has been stated above, it may also be concluded that a low calcium diet will similarly precipitate fluorotic symptoms at a very early date. On account of the difficulty of devising a cattle ration very poor in calcium content, this experiment could not be taken
B. N. MAJUMDAR AND S. N. RAY 111 up ; but this assumption is supported by the work of Ranganathan [1941] with rats, in which he has shown that the withdrawal of calcium from a high fluorine diet led to early death of the animals and that the toxic effect of fluorine was inversely proportional to the calcium intake. Like Ramiah [1941] and Du Toit et al. [1937], we also found that large amounts of fluorine were being retained from rations containing an appreciable quantity of this mineral. In the present experiment, the kidneys proved to be the main channel of fluo- rine excretion which, however, was contrary to-what was observed by Du Toit et al. [1937]. Supplementation of calcium and aluminium salts in the diet increased the amount of fluorine excreted in faeces, but by only a small amount, the greater portion being still excreted in urine. This shows that the beneficial effect of calcium phosphate supple- ment in the first experiment and the protecting action of calcium and phosphorus in pro- per ratio in three groups of the second set of experiments were not due to the precipi- tation of fluorine by calcium in the alimentary canal. On the other hand, it will be noticed that although more fluorine was being retained by the calcium group of animals in the first experiment, these bulls were better in condition than these in the high fluorine group. That the evaluation of net retention of fluorine does not give any idea about the condition of an animal is also seen from the results of the second set of experi- ments. Here the animals of the calcium group, while losing condition rapidly, were re- taining about the same quantity of fluorine as the animals in the other groups of this set. It seems further that bovines behave differently from rats, as in the latter species the retention of fluorine is depressed by 10 to 12 per cent, when the calcium intake is increased [Lawrenz and Mitchell, 1941]. The question now arises as to how calcium and phosphorus in adequate quantity and right proportion help in checking the rapid onset of the toxic effects of fluorine compounds. The absence of precipitation in the alimentary canal in any significant quantity suggests that the ingested fluorine must be mobolised somewhere inside the body. It has already been stated in our previous paper [Majumdar et al, 1943] that extensive periosteal deposits were met with in the fluorine-fed animals. The formation of these deposits may be nature's attempt to detoxicate the ingested fluorine by an increased activity of osteoid tissue. This osteogenic action of fluorine is evident from the better balance of calcium and phosphorus in our low- fluorine group of animals in the first set, and has also been revealed by the histological examination of bones of animals suffering from fluorosis [Pande, 1944]. It was also found by us [Majumdar et al, 1943] that these exostoses contain a very high concentration of fluorine. The new bone formed under the influence of fluorine feeding is considered to have the com- position of calcium fluorapatite and is deposited on the outer surface of the pre existing skeletal tissue. So long as bone-forming minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, are supplied in adequate quantities and in proper proportion, the new bone formation and conse- quent removal (detoxication) of fluorine will proceed smoothly. A metabolism trial in such circumstances will indicate a high retention of fluorine in a non-toxic form. This was actually the case in our calcium group of animals (first experiment), as well as in the animals of the various groups in the second experiment. When, however, fluorine is fed at a very high level for long periods or when sufficient bone-forming minerals are not present in the feed, or when these minerals are not in correct proportion, body reserves of calcium and phosphorus are used up in an attempt to detoxicate the ingested fluorine. This leads to a weakening of bones, resulting in fractures and other skeletal deformities so often seen in cases of fluorosis. If fluorine feeding is still persisted in and it no attempt is made to correct the deficiency or imbalance of calcium and phosphorus, this rate of bone deposition will slow down due to gradual saturation of bony tissues with fluorine, and consequently much of the ingested fluorine will escape detoxication, and the concentration of this mineral in the blood will go up. A portion of this excess fluorine will be excreted through urine, but with the increase in the blood fluorine concentration, the various soft organs of the body will be acted upon destruc- tively with the production of syndromes of fluorosis and resulting finally in death. This is presumably what had happened to the animals of the high fluorine (first experiment) and calcium (second experiment) groups, as well as in Ranganathan's [1941] rats on a low calcium diet. It will also be noticed from Tables I and II that the groups showing the most aggravated
112 Fluorine Intoxication of Cattle in India symptoms were also excreting very high amounts of fluorine in urine. We can even say that the intensity of fluorine intoxication is proportional to the amount of fluorine passed out in urine. That the urinary output of fluorine is a good index of fluorosis was also noticed by Brun, Buchwald and Roholm [1941] in cryolite workers. In the light of our present knowledge, it is not possible as yet to explain the beneficial action of aluminium ingestion. As aluminium does dot help in the elimination of fluorine by precipitating it to any great extent in the alimentary canal, it may be assumed that here too the detoxication is proceeding inside the body. The exact mechanism, however, is not under. stood; but it is hoped that the chemical and histological investigations which are in progress may yield a clue to this problem. SUMMARY The addition of fluorine in small doses helps in the better retention of calcium and phosphorous. Fluorosis can be rapidly produced in hill bulls by administering a high amount of fluorine to animals on a low phosphorus ration or on a ration in which the ratio between calcium and phosphorous is very wide. Addition of calcium or phosphorus salts in amounts adequate to bring the quantity of and the ratio between the two minerals to optimum levels helped in protecting the animals for long periods against fluorine intoxication. A theory as to the mechanism of detoxication of the system against fluorosis is advanced and discussed. A large positive balance of fluorine was observed in all animals given high quantities of this element. The estimation of net retention of fluorine gave no indication of the condition of the animal. On the other hand, the poorer the condition of an animal, the greater the quantity of this mireral excreted in urine. Hence, urinary output of fluorine was a good index of the intensity of fluorine intoxication. Ingestion of aluminium sulphate was very effective in preventing fluorosis, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Our thanks are due to Dr K. C.

FLUORINE INTOXICATION OF CATTLE IN INDIA III. EFFECT OF FLUOROSIS ON THE COMPOSITION OF BLOOD By B. N. Majumdar and S. N. Ray, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 24 January 1946) THE importance of studying the blood composition of animals under any pathological con- dition is well recognised, since such analysis can be conveniently used to follow the trend of biochemical breakdown, long before any clinical symptoms develop. As fluorides are known to inhibit in vitro various enzymic reactions, it is surprising that so little work has been done as yet to study blood changes in fluorosis. An attempt was, therefore, made to investigate the changes in some haematological and chemical constituents in the blood of cattle under conditions of sub-acute fluorine poisonings. The results of this investigation are discussed in the present paper. EXPERIMENTAL The animals used were divided into two sets. The first set consisted of five calves114 Fluorine Intoxication of Cattle in India TABLE I Effect of fluorine feeding on the concentration of blood-constituents in calves Constituents Initial 15 days Months 1 2 4 6 8 11 14 Haemoglobin (gm/100cc. blood) 11.32 11.72 12.12 10.76 10.36 9.92 9.46 7.80 6.86 (9.6B.

The fluctuation in the value all the while, how- ever, lay within the normal range [Dukes, 1943]. No systematic examinations" were done with the adult animals, but a few occasional estimations revealed no change in the sugar content. From the findings of Pal, Mullick and Momin [1945], it seems that the fluctua- tion of sugar content in the blood of calves cannot be ascribed to seasonal variation. Gol- demoerg [1928] found transient byper-glycaemia in a kid given sodium fluoride at 0.06 g./kg. while Magenta [1921] found a similar effect in a dog injected intravenously with sodium fluoride. Under acute intoxication of rabbits, Foit [1931] observed hyper glycaemia which reached a maximum one hour after intravenous injection. On the other hand, Luy and Thormahlen [1932] noticed no change in the blood sugar of a cow given fluoric factory dust in its food. In vitro, fluorides are known to inhibit glycolysis. As only slight changes were found in the sugar contents, it appears that the system rapidly adjusts itself and prevents the occurrence of hyper-glycemia. The figures for lactic acid showed wide individual variations, as well as considerable fluctuations from one period to another. As, however, no definite trend was noticeable, it is not surprising that satistical analyses yielded significant conclusion either in the case of the calves or the hill bulls. The only reference on record is that of Foit [1931], who found in rabbits a rise in blood lactic acid after intravenous injections of sodium fluoride. Total protein No significant difference from the normal was found in animals of any group. Creatinine The results regarding the creatinine content of blood were rather peculiar. In calves, the values showed an increase immediately after fluorine feeding was started. The values, however, remained more or less unchanged at this high level all through the experimental period. In the case of most of the adults no such change was observed, except for the high phosphorus group. In these animals statistically significant decrease in blood creatin- ine was seen from the sixth month onward. Chlorides. In calves, the chloride content of blood was found to show a significant increase from the fourth month. This upward trend was maintained but for an inexplicable drop in the eighth month. In adults, no variations could be noticed, but, as estimations were started after the animals were on experiment for four months, it is difficult to say whether a rise similar to those seen in calves had taken place. It must, however, be mentioned that all the values for creatinine and chlorides were within the normal range [Dukes, 1943]. The trend towards higher values indicates abnormal excretion due to renal oysfunction. In the present case the increase in values was very slight, and impairment of function, therefore, was not pronounced. Pathological changes in the kidney have been found in fluorosis [Kick, Bethke and Edgington, 1933, Marconi, 1930, Slagsvold, 1934]. Calcium and phosphorus Neither in the calves nor in the adults was any significant difference noticed in blood calcium. In the adults, the same was true for blood inorganic phosphorus. These results support our earlier observations [Majumdar, Ray and Sen, 1943]. In the calves, however, as soon as they took to fluorotic diet, blood inorganic phosphorus began to fall rather sharply at first and gradually later until the second month. Thereafter, it started to rise again and got stabilized to a slightly lower value than the initial and was within the normal limits found by Mullick and Pal [1943]. In acute fluorine intoxication, produced by intravenous injection of large quantities of fluoride salts, a considerable reduction of calcium content of blood was seen in dogs [Gers- chmann, 1930; Pavlovic and Bogdanovic, 1932] and in rabbits [Jodlvauer, 1931; Foid, 1931], Gerschmann [1930] found an increase in the inorganic phosphorus of the experimental animals, whereas Pavlovic and Bogdanovic [1932] observed a definite reduction. In chronic in- toxication, however, the differences recorded by these workers were less pronounced. Hauck, Steenbock and Parsons [1933] and Chaimeles [1930] found no definite changes in the serum calcium of the rat, even on prolonged feeding, Phillips [1932] found a tendency towards a fall in serum calcium in heifers, and Bogdanovic [1935] found an increase in the serum calcium in dogs fed small quantities of fluorine. The recorded observations in the change
120 Fluorine Intoxication of Cattle in India of blood inorganic phosphorus are likewise not uniform. Thus, in some observations the phosphorus value shows a tendency to rise [Phillips, 1932 in heifers], in others.to decline [Pavlovic: and Bogdanovic, 1932 in dogs], and in few others to remain unaffected [Hauck et al, 1933 in rats; Lny and Thormahlen, 1932 in cattle]. It should, however, be stressed that the fluctuations in either serum calcium or phosphorus reported by various workers are, very slight and it is doubtful whether such changes are significant. In Part I of this series [Majum- dar et al. 1943], it has been shown that no changes in serum calcium and phosphorus could be recorded in the field cases of fluorosis. The changes in phosphorus content in the blood of calves are interesting, as it brings to light some influence of fluorine on phosphorus metabolism in growing animals, but as all the figures were well within the normal range of values given for blood phosphorus, such changes cannot be considered to indicate aphosphorosis. Phosphatase Like haemoglobin and red cells, the phosphatase value of serum was found to be great- ly affected by fluorine feeding. In both adult and young animals, the values at the end of the experimental period were greatly diminished. In calves, however, the trend was not uniform; at first it showed a sharp rise but after a month started to decline and the final value fell significantly lower than the initial figures. Phillips [1932] observed, a simi- lar rise in phosphatase content in heifers on feeding fluorine, but as his experiments were not continued for long, the decline observed in the present experiments was not recorded. It was interesting to observe in adult animals that aluminium supplements helped to delay the decline in serum phosphatase, and the final value was also not significantly lower than the initial figures. High serum phosphatase is a manifestation of rapid growth of bones. The increased initial phosphatase concentration, therefore, points to growth-promoting activity of fluorine compounds on bony tissues. The formation of extensive deposits on the long bones support this theory. In course of time, due to the poisonous effects of fluorites, the osteoblasts are degenerated, resulting thereby in a diminished bone formation which is reflected in the lowering of phosphatase content in the serum. Histological examination of bony materials also supports this hypothesis, as extensive degeneration of osteoblasts has been found to occur in fluorosis [Pande, 1944]. SUMMARY A severe anaemia with low red cell count and haemoglobin was produced in animals suffering from chronic fluorine intoxication. Serum calcium and blood inorganic phosphorus in adult animals were not affected by fluorine feeding. In growing animals, the blood phosphorus showed an initial fall and then remained more or less steady during an experimental period of one year. Serum phosphatase content was greatly diminished in fluorosis, and the significance of this is discussed. Fluorine ingestion at the level of 3 mg. per kg. body-weight seemed to have little effect on the concentration of the other constitutents examined. A. trend towards increased value in the case of chlorides and creatinine was observed; but the final values all lay within the normal ranges found for cattle.

Australian Agricultural News; letter, Release No. AGN/114, January, 1946. AT the Werribee (Victoria Field Station of the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a comprehensive experiment has been conducted for 3½ years to determine the effect of seasonal availability of green feed on the periodicity and incidence of oestrus (heat) in Merino ewes. There were six groups. One was grazed continuously on natural pasture, and another continuously on irrigated pasture. The other four groups had access to green feed in the form of irrigated pasture for periods of three months, each at four different periods of the year. One group had the pasture during December-February, one for March-May, another for June August and the fourth for September-November. For the remaining nine months each group was maintained on dry conserved fodder. In all groups the highest occurrence of oestrus was observed in those months of the years, January-June, which have been shown by earlier experiments to be the normal breeding season following access to green feed irrespective of the time of the year when such feed become avail- able. The fundamental seasonal rhythm of sexual activity was not affected. Observations also showed the importance of adequate nutrition at the weaner stage in accelerating the devolopment of sexual maturity and in increasing the intensity of sexual activity of the mature sheep.
NOTES. A MEASURE FOR THE FERTILITY OF SPERM Skandinavisk Veterinartidskrift, Uppsala, 1942 THE usual measures employed in estimating the concentration and the motility of spermatozoa often have resulted in misleading conclusions, because, while it is fairly easy to use a counting chamber to determine concentration, it is very difficult to make an accurate estimate of the number of cells that are truly motile. Recent investigations indicate that the energy needed by the spermatozoa for movement is derived chiefly from the process of anaerobic metabolism, and that the intensity of this metabolism can be measured by the dehydrogenization power of the cells. Most cells derive the greater part of their energy through aerobic metabolism. Because anaerobic metabolism consists of hydrolysis of glucose into lactic acid, which undergoes further anaerobic cleavage it does not result in the production of carbon dioxide and water but the oxidation takes place through liberation of hydrogen. The rate of anaerobic metabolism cannot be measured by the usual gasometric methods, but can be computed from the 'acceptor method' which uses a dye that is highly colored when oxidized, while possessing little or no color when reduced or hydrogenized to the so-called leuco-form. The decoloration time of methylene blue affords an excellent indicator of the dehydrogeni- zation power of the sperm. A highly fertile semen with an abundance of motile spermatozoa will decolorize more rapidly than semen of poorer quality. Dr Ed. Soren sen developed a test using special glassware and a gelation dilution fluid, and by placing the semen under test in a water bath the decoloration time gave him an accurate estimate of its fertility. A really fertile semen containing about one million spermatozoa per c. c, of which 50 to 60 per cent are actively motile, will decolorize his test material in ten minutes. A semen con. taining 700,000 to 800,000 sperm cells, or which has a smaller percentage of active sperm, will decolorize in fifteen to twenty minutes. A slightly fertile semen with a low concentration of spermatozoa and/or many dead cells will decolorize in twenty-five to thirty minutes, while any sample that requires more than thirty minutes to accomplish complete decoloration is con- sidered unfertile. FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR MICROBIOLOGY. NEWS has been received at the office of the Indian National Committee of the Inter. national Association of Microbiologists that the Fourth International Congress for Micro- biology will be held at Copenhagen, Denmark, from July 20-25, 1947. The business of the Congrees will be conducted through 9 sections. The office of the Fourth International Con- gress is located at Kommunehospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. The office of the Honorary Secretary, Indian National Committee (Dr. A. C. Ukil), is located at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, 110, Chittaranjan Avenue, Calcutta, from whom further informa- tion on the subject can be obtained. For the information of those who will contribute Papers, it is stated that a summary not exceeding 200 words should be in the hands of The General Secretary of the Congrese at Copenhagen not later than the 1st January, 1947.
ORIGINAL ARTICLES MORTALITY IN YOUNG CALVES IN INDIA By F. C. MINETT, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaun (Received for publication on 15 March 1946) (With four text-figures) THERE does not exist any large-scale, precise estimate of mortality among young cattle stock in India. There are vague suggestions that the mortality is much higher than it ought to be, and no doubt there could be found here and there collections of ngures or statements which would fai f the local situation. It would be of great value to amass and analyse comprehensive are ata in this connection, for one thing because it would focus public attention on a pro- b which strikes at the very root of the livestock industry. An example of the sort of survey re- quired is that recently published by Lovell and Bradford Hill [1940] on calf mortality in Great Britain. Their results will be referred to again but at the moment it is enough to say their data, extended over two years, 1936 and 1937, dealt with 382 herds and nearly 28,000 births. The present contribution, which concerns two Military Farms at Secunderabad and Lahore (Airfield), is-but a small beginning. The enquiry should be greatly extended when circumstances permit; such extension has not been possible in war-time, apart from which it must be emphasized that there is only one way to get satisfactory data and that is by personal visit and enquiry. Since weather conditions might not be without influence, it was resolved to examine the mortality-rates at two centres, one in the north and the other in the south. Information, covering approximately the same period, was accordingly obtained from Military Farms at Lahore (Punjab) and Secunderabad (Deccan). At both places the animal management is good, but at Secunderabad there has been a shortage of green feed. As will be seen, however, the climatic and farm conditions at the two places are quite different. The following information was provided by the India Meteorological Department: Station Period Data Begumpet (4 miles from Secunderabad) 1938-44 Mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Mean relative humidity per cent at 8 hours LMT. Lahore (4 miles from Airfield) . . 1939-44 Total rainfall in inches. Number of rainy days. Mean daily wind velocity in miles per hour. Mean wind direction at 8 hours LMT. In all cases the information was given by months, From the data, the monthly means for the required periods have been drawn (Table VII) and examined for any relationship to the mean monthly morta- lity-rate. SECUNDERABAD The farm is one of 480 acres, situated about five miles from Secunderabad city at an altitude of 2,000 ft. The cows are Friesian-Sindhi, the cow stock numbering about 200 from 1938 to 1941 and about 240 since 1941. Average numbers of other cattle stock between 1938-1944 are : calves up to one year 63, between one and two years 56, over two years 56. The size of the buffalo herd has been increasing since 1941, the yearly stock figures from 1939 being 280, 318, 280, 407, 505,and (in 1944) 1,325. The land is poor and unirrigated. The nature of the soil and the low rainfall preclude the abundant growth of fodder grasses, so that there are only three or four acres of fodder grasses. Silage was fed up to 1943. Green grass is cut during the monsoon when about two feet high and fed at 10-15 pounds' daily to the milking cows. After cutting, the pasture is also grazed to some extent. No green stuff is provided for the dry cows or the buffaloes. The cows are tied in the shed and bedded 123 B
124 Mortality in Young Calves in India down if the rain happens to be heavy during the monsoon. Buffaloes stay out in paddocks. There is one cement wallow on the farm for the buffaloes, and through this they are passed once daily throughout the year in lots of 150 every 10 minutes, at 8 a.m. for the milking herd and at 1-30 p.m. for the dry herd. After wallowing, the-buffaloes are taken to a water trough where their udders are washed, and then to the milking shed. Milking is at midnight and 10 a.m., heavy milkers are also milked at 5 p.m. Of the cow herd, some 33 to 35 per cent are dry at one time. Calf husbandry. The chief calving season for cows is September-December and for buffaloes July-September. As a rule, female calves only are kept, the males being slaughtered weekly ; with buffaloes, undersized females or females from low yielders (below 3,500-4,000 lb. per annum) are also not kept. The mean weight at birth is 59 lb. for cow calves and 62 lb. for buffaloes. Calves are weaned at birth and fed from a bucket with colostrum of the dam which is milked f our thrice daily during the first three days. Colostrum is fed at 1. lb. per 10 lb. body weight fte colostral period the calves are put on a definite ration schedule, which is not given in detail here which involves the usual replacement of whole milk by skim and concentrates (gram, wheat bran. crushed cakeF.

Of 188 females retained, the mean percentage of death-rate during the six- year period was 23.4, i.e. practically the same as with cow calves. The range of variation, however, was wide ; in 1942, though only 13 births were accepted, no calves died, in 1944, 14 of the 30 calves retained died. Again the death-rate was higher from October to March, except that for some reason it was low in January. The difference between the mean percentage deaths in winter and in summer is highly significant. During three of the summer months it was as low as 2.3 per cent, compared with the highest rates of about 16 and 18 per cent. It must be noted, however, that the total number of deaths-recorded was only 44. Table III shows that most of the deaths (68 per cent) were due to intestinal disturbances and were spread over the first two months. While the sample is small, the difference the mortality rates from intestinal affections and pneumonia is found to be highly cant. TABLE III Secunderabad.

Relation to climati c means. Air temperature, (g) Mean daily maximum. There is no evident relationship with the mortality in cow or buffalo calves. Thus in January to June the temperature is high and most of the time rising, while the deaths are high in January-March (except January. with the buffaloes) and low in April- June. From July-December the temperature is more or less level. while the death-rate is definite- ly lower in July-September than in October-December. (b) Mean daily minimum. There is an inverse relationship with mortality. Relative humidity. There is no clear relationship. Thus, while in January, July-September the R.H. is high, the death-rate is high in January (except again with buffaloes) and low in July-September. In March-May, the R.H. is low, while the death-rate is high in March and low in April and May.
130 Mortality in Young Calves in India Rainfall. The relationship with death-rate is inverse. The only exception is that in October, although the mean total rainfall is 2.06 in., the deaths are high. The rainfall is well distributed throughout the year, not exceeding on an average 1 in. in a day. Wind velocity. The relationship with death-rate is inverse. Thus in May-September the velo- city is above five miles per hour, and the mortality low, in January-March and October-December it is the converse. Wind direction. In December-April this is most commonly from the SE in June- September the prevailing wind is from the NW and in October and November from the NE. Thus, at Secunderabad, an enhanced death-rate is associated with a lower mean minimum tem- perature, a low rainfall and a low wind velocity. All these factors are coincident with winter months, but it seems most unlikely that any of them are directly concerned. Thus, the minimum temperature is never lowF. C. MINETT 131 SICKNESS AND MORTALITY One trouble noted with the calves is a certain degree of hairlessness, especially around the neck and brisket, but this clears up quickly with green feeding.

MINETT 133 RELATION BETWEEN DEATH-RATE AND WEATHER CONDITIONS The data in Table IV and Fig. 4 have been inspected with the meteorological data. Air temperature. Mean daily maximum and minimum. There is an inverse relationship with. death-rate. Relative humidity. There is some direct relationship with death-rate. Thus, in December- February the RH and death-rate are high, whereas in April-June both are low. But in August and November, the RH is high and the death-rate low, suggesting that the apparent direct relationship is due to some other cause than humidity. Rainfall. There is no clear relationship. Thus, in March-May both rainfall and deaths are low, but in October and December in the absence of rain the death-rate is high. Again, in January, February and September a rainfall of 1-2 in. is associated with a high mortality-rate, but in June- August with a much heavier rainfall the death-rate is low. The rainfall is well distributed throughout the year, not exceeding on. an average 1 in. in a day. Wind velocity. There is a tendency for the relationship to be inverse, The wind velocity, how- ever, is fairly uniform throughout the year, at 1.1 to 3.1 miles per hour. The death-rate is low from March-August when the velocity varies from 2.0-3.1 m.p.h., and high in September-February (except November) when the wind velocity is 1.1-2.4 m.p.h. Wind direction. From December-April the prevailing wind is from the NE and NW, in June- September from the SE. Thus at Airfield, lower mean air temperatures are the only factors showing any satisfactory rela- tionship with death-rates and this relationship is of a negative order. If anything it is no doubt the minimum temperature that could be chiefly concerned, since this can be very low in the Punjab. DRY PERIOD FOR COWS AT THE TWO CENTRES This is shown in Table VI as a frequency distribution. Although the total numbers of animals at the two centres are not quite comparable, there is a suggestion that at Airfield the length of dry period is more in accordance with good dairying practice. At neither centre, however, can the dry periods be considered satisfactory, for instance, with cows in western countries calving at twelve- month intervals a dry period of eight weeks is aimed at.

MINETT 135 DISCUSSION Calf mortality figures. The first question that may be put is what should be considered a ' normal death-rate in cow calves. Lovell and Bradford Hill [1940], in the article mentioned above, state that in 335 milk-recorded and thus somewhat selected herds in England and Wales out of 12,544 female calves born alive, 693 (5.5 per cent) died before the age of six months. If calves of both sexes are included, and still-births or abortions added. then of 27.970 pregnancies 14.9 per cent failed to produce a calf surviving to the age of six months. They found the death-rate in Scotland to be significantly higher, viz. 158 (11.4 per cent) out of 1,383 females born. This figure is not as high as that given by Jordan [193,3] in another enquiry in Ayrshire (Scotland), who found that of 78,4 females born, 169 (21.6 per cent) died. The death-rates of calves born in the spring of two consecutive years were 24 and 27 per cent compared with only 8 per cent for calves born in the autumn, the difference being ributed by Jordan to the extra green food consumed by the pregnant cows during the summer. In the observations of Lovell and Bradford Hill, the mortality in calves born alive showed a seasonal swing, being significantly higher in the first half than in the second half of the year. There is an advantage in allowing calves to take the colostrum naturally from the mother compared with feeding it from the bucket. In the females, nearly half the deaths took place in the first week of life and three-quarters of them in the first month, and the probable cause of death in most cases was ' white scours '. The following figures from the United States, referring to calves of both, sexes, may be noted. Wing [1933] gives figures relating to forty years' (1889 to 1928) working in the University herd at Cornell. Of 644 conceptions during this period, there were 120 (18.6 per cent) which died at or before birth, and 61 (9.5 per cent) which died within-three months. Slack and Harrison [quoted by Savage and McCay, 1942] add figures for the Cornell herd for the years, 1932-42. From 1,352 conceptions, there were 169 (12.5 per cent) which died at or before birth, and 144 (10.7 per cent,136 Mortality in Young Calves in India no sign of vitamin-A deficiency in the cow calves such as night blindness had been noticed, but such signs might easily have been overlooked without a special examination. Although the buffalo dry stock also get no green fodder, deaths in the buffalo calves were mostly due to other causes than pneumonia. The most likely explanation of the difference is that buffaloes are. able to convert caro- tene into vitamin-A much more readily than cows and in amounts sufficient at least to prevent pneu- monia. In the same connection, it may be observed that at the Military Farm at Quetta, where no green fodder at all was grown, blindness in cow calves was at one time common whereas the buffalo calves were unaffected. Seasonal effects. The mortality rates at the two centres have a definite seasonal swing, being higher in the winter, both in the gross and in the special case of pneumonia at Secunderabad. Although certain relationships have been established between seasonal mortality rates and weather factors, it does not of course follow that these factors contribute directly to the deaths. Any direct influence in fact seems to be unlikely, except just possibly in the case of the minimum air temperature at Air- field, though even here there was not undue exposure. It might be thought that, since the number of calves born in the winter is relatively greater than the number born in the summer, the higher winter death-rate is simply due to crowding. This, however, does not seem to be the case. since examination of the total births and deaths for the period October to March of different years shows no significant association between the numbers of births and deaths. With buffalo-calves, this relationship between births and deaths could not be studied because of the animals born so few are retained. This is not the place to attempt a full discussion of the difficult subject of seasonal variation of disease. A few points were briefly referred to in a former paper on the incidence of equine strangles [Minett, 1944], and an interesting recent discussion of the subject as a whole is given by Aycock and others [1945]. Wilson [1930] rightly objects to the use of the word ' seasonal'. unless it is shown that the changes in question occur with regular sequence in the same direction at corresponding periods of successive years. Unfortunately, my figures for annual deaths are too small for statistical examination in the sense of Wilson's definition, but the combined figures for the period do show significantly higher death-rates in winter. The most likely explanation is a greater susceptibility of the calves in winter, which may arise through dietary causes or through lowered activity of the tissues physiological in origin (' fluctuating immunity ' of non-specific kind). The latter may, of course, be dependent on dietary causes, while'climatic and other agencies may act in a secondary manner. In amplification of this, the following references may be quoted. Brown and others [Brown, 1929] have shown that the body undergoes seasonal variations in its physical and chemical constitution, which are related to (a) variations in functional activity, rendered necessary by a changing environment, and (b) suscepti- bility to disease, infectious or otherwise. An example of (a) is that the weights of the endocrine organs are at an overall maximum in summer. As regards a direct dietary causation, Watson [1937] showed that young mice on a diet containing dried evaporated milk were more resistant to experimental infection, perhaps due to the extra provision of milk protein. Quite apart from the specific deficiency in the diet at Secunderabad, it is easily possible that there and also at Airfield the calves were not getting enough milk for their optimal requirements, at least during winter ; at Air- field too the winter colostrum may have been qualitatively somewhat deficient in vitamin-A. .It may be noted in this same connection that Keener and others [1942] have shown that the minimal carotene requirements of dairy calves may be at least twice as great during severe winter weather as during warmer weather. Reduction of calf mortality. The steps that may be taken to reduce mortality in young calves have often been considered. The importance of good general hygiene in the matter of sanitation and nousing, and of adequate colostrum, milk and vitamin-A feeding is well established. In spite of what seems adequate attention to such matters, losses are sometimes unduly high. One outstanding point which often does not receive due attention is the grouping of calves during early life. It may be insufficient to form two age groups, viz. calves from birth up to three months, and calves from three months upwards. Savage and McCay [1942] refer to some observations by Harrison in the Cornell University herd. From 1932.37, out of 515 calves born, 109 (21.2 per cent)
F. C. MINETT 137 died of pneumonia ; from 1938-4], out of 522 calves born, only 35 (6.7 per cent) died of this disease. The difference was ascribed to the fact that in 1937 Harrison introduced a ' small-unit plan '. For at least the first 12 weeks the calves were segregated in small groups, a group consisting of not more than eight calves; in addition to this, each calf had a small separate pen and so was not in direct contact with its fellows. The groups were kept in small unheated but well-insulated barns. Cows should be allowed a dry period of not less than three months before calving, since Stewart and McCallum [1938 a] found the vitamin-A of the colostrum to be materially affected by the length of the dry period. The colostrum should be taken by the calf naturally rather than from the bucket. Vinattieri, Hayward, and Artioli [1945] have shown that with buffaloes in the Lahore area removal of the calf at birth leads to many more cases of retained placenta in the dam, a reduced milk yield188 Colouring of Vanaspati Ghee 3.

Bull. 576 COLOURING OF VANASPATI GHEE By AMAR NATH PURI and VED RATTAN, University Institute of Chemistry, Lahore Received for publication on 15 March 1946) SOMETIME ago the Punjab Government in response to the public demand for the prevention of adnl- teration of ghee enacted legislation rendering it compulsory for the manufacturers and dealers of vanaspati ghee to colour their product. The object of this legislation was to render the adulteration of natural ghee with vanaspati impossible, as any such adulteration would at once be detected by the colour. The passing of the bill gave rise to much controversy but it eventually became law. Soon afterwards, however. a grave difficulty arose regarding the most suitable colour to use. It was conceded on all hands that the dye recommended should have the following properties : 1. It should have no harmful effect on human beings, immediate or cumulative. 2. It should have a pleasing shade. The only dye which seemed to satisfy both these conditions appeared to be Orange E and this was suggested. However. before this dye could be taken up for colouring ghee, evidence was submit- ted by certain individuals which threw some doubt on the absolutely harmless character of this dye. The only course which appeared logical at this juncture was to carry out physiological experi- ments to decide the issue. While the Government was looking for facilities for such experiments the senior author formulated a scheme of research work to elucidate information on the following points :AMAR NATH PURI AND VED RATTAN 139 Curiously enough this most fundamental and vital point, i.e. the stability of the dye, had been ignored hitherto. It would be clear to any body that no dye would be recommended for colouring artificial ghee if it could be easily removed by simple treatments requiring no technical skill. The removal of colouring matter from oils and fats is well known to chemists and the decolourizing of natural fats is. being carried out in hundreds of places with methods based on the well-established bleaching properties of activated charcoal, light and heat; and there appeared no reason for the belief that any colouring matter added to artificial ghee would resist such treatments. The following list of oil-soluble dyes practically exhaust the entire range of possible colours that could be used for colouring artificial ghee irrespective of their physiological effects.

142 Colouring of Vanaspati Ghee CONCLUSION A careful examination of the results has brought forth the interesting results that there is not a single dye (harmless or otherwise) that cannot be removed from ghee by simple treatments which require no elaborate knowledge of chemistry. Activated charcoal for instance can bleach all the dyes, simpler still, light can remove practically the entire quantity of natural dye. It is, therefore, clear that we are up against practically an unsurmountable difficulty in the problem of clouring artificial ghee. There is no doubt that every organic chemist will endorse the view that it would be impossible to find a dye that would be absolutely stable in fat solution. The bleaching of even fast c lours in sunlight is well known and every one must have noticed the fading away of beautiful colours on garments which owed their attractiveness to the pleasing combination of colours. The Government must, therefore, drop this legislation as will never be the faintest hope of finding any dye that would be fast enough to last any length of time under normal conditions of exposure even if it is not subjected to simple treatments that would remove them entirely. In view of these results research on the physiological effect of any one of these dyes would be utterly useless for the purpose in hand. In fact any new dye not listed in here, and which might be suggested as possible colouring for artificial ghee, should be tested first for stability before its claims for harmlessness are gone into. By the very nature of things all possible dyes must be of organic origin and without knowledge of the general properties of such dyes it would be futile to consider any new dye unless the advocates are prepared to bring forth proof of their stability on lines detailed in the present investigation. It is not merely a question of the stability of a dye, we have also to consider the possibility of the decomposition of an organic dye on heating and the production of harmful bye-products. Arti- ficial ghee has come to be regarded as a valuable article of food. In any case there is not enough natural ghee in the country to supply the demand of even 10 per cent of the population. The pre- vention of adulteration of natural ghee with vanaspati is a laudable object, but it cannot be achieved by colouring the artificial ghee. The only satisfactory solution to this problem is to refine our ana- lytical methods so that it might be possible to detect such adulteration by physico-chemical tests in the laboratory. APPENDIX I Experimental details of the preparation of various natural dyes 1. Ratanjot, Onosma echioides Linn. This substance has been used as a substitute for alkanet as it imparts a rich red colour to oils and fats, and for this reason it is most suited as also due to its harmless nature. Preparation of the dye Method I. One hundred grams of root bark is well extracted in amyl alcohol. The amyl alcohol solution is concentrated under vacuum (Maximum temperature 110°C.). The thick mass is dissolved in alcohol and filtered, concentrated under vacuum and last traces of amyl alcohol removed by boiling with water. Crude dye recovered=6 gm. Method II. One hundred grams of root bark is extracted with acetone by refluxing for three hours. The acetone is distilled and the dye extracted by alcohol. The alcohol is distilled. Crude dye recovered=9 gm. Purification of the dye The dye is precipitated as copper salt by adding copper sulphate in boiling condition. The copper salt of the dye is slightly soluble in alcohol, so dilution of the alcoholic solution of the dye after adding copper sulphate, but before heating, facilitates the precipitation of the dye salt. The pre- cipitated copper salt is filtered and washed with water.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Method of preparation Two hundred grams of turmeric powder is well boiled with 70 per cent alcohol for two hours. The residue left after filtration is again twice extracted like above. The filtrate was 200 ml but still a big fraction of the dye is left unextracted in the residue. The dye present in two litres filtrate is precipitated with 50 gm. of lead acetate. The lead salt thus precipitated is well washed with alcohol and water. About 50 per cent of the dye is left behind unprecipitated. The lead salt of the dye is washed with water (hot) and it is suspended in hot water and decom- posed by H2SO4 till a fairly acid reaction is reached. Lead sulphate thus produced and the dye are washed and the dye is extracted in 500 c.c. of 92 per cent alcohol. The lead sulphate is removed by filtration and the dye is concentrated to a small bulk. This concentrated dye is poured in ether and kept overnight. Next day supernatent portion is removed, concentrated over water bath and carbon di-sulphide is added and evaporated to dryness (m.p.=162°C.)

One of the most character- istic values for butterfat, the Reichert-Meissl value for example, varies for genuine ghee from 40 to 14 and a strict legislation at a high level is not fair to the producer of genuine ghee of low R.M. value ; even in the interests of the detection of adulteration it is not desirable to fix the R.M. value at so high a level (24 or 28) as to cause the producer of such genuine low R.M. ghee to artificially manipulate his product to conform to specifications often at the cost of quality, purity and value. An attempt will be made below to give an account of the causes for variation in the ' constants ' of ghee, the methods recommended for the detection of its adulteration, and the lines for future work and legislation with the old adage regarding an ounce of prevention in mind : for it must never be forgotten that the difficulties in the detection of adulteration are enormously augmented with pro- crastination, as the sophisticator advances in a knowledge of the chemistry of his product. THE VARIATIONS IN THE CONSTANTS OF GHEE Of the many causes that are responsible for variations in ghee, the most important will be briefly mentioned. These represent a genuine and impossible-to-prevent difficulty in the way alike of analyst and sophisticator, and must therefore be appreciated by both. Breed and species. "While the idiosyncrasies of western breeds of animals, such as the well- known peculiarity of cows of the Channel Isles of excluding colouring matters to a smaller extent from entering their milk fat, are widely realized, Indian breeds of animals have not received much attention. The work of Doctor, Banerjee and Kothavalla [1940] shows that breed variations are quite manifest in Indian cows, since within each breed (Sindhi, Gir, cross-bred, etc.) the analytical values were remarkably constant but differed from breed to breed. Also Indian cows exhibited much less carotene and vitamin-A in their milk fats than foreign, and Indian buffaloes even less. The average values of these workers are shown in Table I.

BANERJEE 147 METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF ADULTERATION IN GHEE In addition to several methods that have been recommended below, notice has also been taken of a few procedures that have at one time or another been specified for the detection of the genuineness or otherwise of butterfat. The analytical constants of ghee. While in the west a correlation of the constants of butterfat has been used for many years as by far the best standard of purity, with particular attention to the delicate balance between the R.M., P.V. and Kirschner value, no attempt has been made in India to indicate even the elements of such correlation other than a somewhat restricted attempt by Brahma- chari [1927]. In fact, one Provincial Government has even gone so far as to assume that the same R.M.-P.V. relationship holds good for both cow and buffalo ghee. a state of affairs far from the actual case as shown below. Recent work by Achaya, Katrak and Banerjee [1946], which also made use the published work on the analytical constants of Indian ghees where such figure available on indi- vidual samples, has indicated the following average analytical interrelationship, which is strongly recommended as a guide to provincial analysts and legislators.

148 On the Detection of Adulteration of Ghee These relationships are exhibited along five axes in Fig. 1. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Interrelationship between the constant of ghee In support and confirmation of these figures, the averages obtained many years ago by Hogan and Griffith-Jones [1916] for Egyptian buffalo milk fat may be quoted : R.M. 31.2, P.V. 1.5. S.V. 229, I.V. 31.4, and B.R. (at 40°C.) 42.5 ; these tally with remarkable exactitude. While the usefulness of further large-scale work to confirm and adjust the figures in the above tables are of the first importance, the latter are sufficiently indicative of several observations. The Polenske, iodine and R.I. values for buffalo ghee are striking, and with physical characteristics like colour and flavour, set such ghee quite apart from cow ghee. It is therefore easy to see that a serious difficulty in the actual use of these interrelationships would be the sale of mixed ghee, and from many points of view it would be an advantage if admixture of cow with buffalo ghee were to be prevented by law. and if producers were asked to label clearly the products they display. It becomes further necessary to base a legal standard for purity not upon individual analytical maxima or minima but upon a table of interrelationship such as the above, using if necessary only the R.M., P.V. and R.I. as routine tests, with suitable limits of variation of the other constants with respect to each. say. R.M. value ; this would result in the legal criterion for ghee taking the form not of straight-line graphs, as shown in Fig. 1 but of bands of a thickness to be determined by statistical working up of many hundreds of analyses of genuine ghee. The variations from normal naturally depend upon the quality of a sample of ghee, and rancid, high-acid, moisture-bearing market products must be carefully sampled before use. Many of the factors that upset the constants of ghee do so in a fashion that follows the interrelationships shown in the tables, an increase of R.M., e.g. being usually counterbalanced by a corresponding fall in I.V. Among such factors that are ' regular ' are : breed variations seasonal, lactational and untritional variations; and some feeding stuffs like cottonseed meal and fish meal.
K. T. ACHAYA AND B. N. BANERJEE 149 The Kirschner value. This has recently been strongly advocated by Sen Gupta [1943]; since it varies largely with the R.M. value, little is to be gained by encumbering the R.M. process with a further K.V. determination. The neutralization value of Hawley [1940] whose merit is that it measures the water-insoluble acids, as it were, by omitting butyric acid, is not likely on theoretical grounds to have wide appli- cation, since it is not merely the variations in content of butyric acid alone that affect the simple S.V., but changes in the other acids as well. An extended trial, especially of ghees from cottonseed- feeding areas which contain very little butyric acid but large proportions of stearic acid, should prove the point. The Ave-Lallement value has been shown long ago by Plymen and Aiyer [1921] and later by Parthasarathi and Banerjee (unpublished work) to have very little value since positive values were often obta . To quote a few of the figures of the latter workers, cows fed on the cakes mentioned low gave baryta values as shown : Groundnut +10.3 ........ Cottonseed + 4.7 Gingilli +8.0........ Coconut +16.4 Linseed +0.1 ........ Moreover, a genuine sample of buffalo ghee from the Kathiawar district gave a figure of+23, while another sample gave a value as low as 150 On the Detection of Adulteration of Ghee The phytosteryl acetate test can ofcourse never be dispensed with as an absolute and final proof of the use of adulterant vegetable oils, though its use as a routine can never of course be possible. It has at various times been stated that over-heated oils and paraffin oils interfere with the accuracy of the determination. THE SCOPE OF FUTURE WORK AND LEGISLATION Further work should lie in the direction of: 1. Statistically planned, extended trials of the analyses of ghee from various parts of India, with a view to fixing the limits of the constants, their interrelationship and the deviations with respect to an average interrelationship. 2. Systematic feeding experiments with a view both to indicate the variations in the constants and to give some idea especially of buffalo fat metabolism. 3. Giving an extended trial to the more promising methods listed above : the estimation linoleic acid by the iodine and thiocyanogen values and of butyric acid enzymatically using a specific butyrinase, the ' A ', ' B', and neutralization values. etc. Further improvement of legislation and impetus by Government should be directed to151 THE REFRACTIVE DISPERSION OF GHEE By K. T. ACHAYA and B. N. BANERJEE, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Received for publication on 27 December 1945) (With two text figures) WHILE the refractive index has long been recognized as a useful sorting test in the analysis of ghee, its usefulness has been strictly limited in that mixtures of oils can be prepared to yield refractive indices similar to that of ghee. The refractive dispersion, which is the difference in refractive indices for two specified lines of the spectrum at any constant temperature, was first used for the analysis of oils by Szalaygi [1914], and a few years later by Fryer and Weston [1918], the latter with the express intention of detecting the adulteration of one oil with another, if possible, While they succeeded in dly differentiating between the drying and the non-drying oils, the variations in dis ersion were too small to permit the detection of small quantities of sophistication. In 1938, Athavale and Jatkar took up again the 20 year old work and showed that by plot- ting dispersion against refractive index, oils could be divided into several classes. Since the one sample of butterfat was indefinitely placed, they studied six new samples of ghee and stated in con- clusion that 'it should be possible to detect the adulteration of ghee by measurement of both refractive index and dispersion '. The method was commended by Godbole and Sadgopal [1939] who were also working on similar lines by observing the colour fringes of fats on. an uncompensated refracto meter ; besides, most oils have a high dispersion unlike that of ghee, and though teniary mixtures of oils can be made having the same dispersion as that of ghee, the consistency of the mixture would be a drawback to its use as an adulterant. EXPERIMENTAL The refractometer used for the study was of the Pulfrich model, made by Zeiss, and the source of light was a Hanovia, 152 The Refractive Dispersion of Ghee These samples were all made in the laboratory and were of R.M. value about 27 ; they show remarkable uniformity in their dispersions.

It seems difficult to explain this phenomenon, especially considering the similar dispersions of the hydrogenated oils and ghee. Promising results were however obtained with groundnut oil, which may be considered as a typical unsaturated oil with a high dispersion, and coconut oil, the only common oil with a disper- sion below that of ghee. The results show mathematical behaviour and are therefore capable of practical application (Tables VIII, IX and X).

ACHAYA AND B. N. BANERJEE 157 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 2.158 The Refractive Dispersion of Ghee SUMMARY 1. The dispersion of ghee from the buffalo has been studied. The value for pure ghee is very constant and averages 0.00876. 2. Rancidification lowers the value ; neutralization of rancid ghee further lowers the dispersion but raises the refractive index. 3. The R.M. value has no correlation with dispersion, unlike the R. I. 4. Adulteration with hydrogenated oils cannot be detected nor with oil-mixtures. Single oil adulterants can be detected with accuracy by a suggested system of combination. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

Agricultural Chemist and JIWAN DAS CHOPRA, Assistant Agricultural Chemist, Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur (Received for publication on 26 October 1945) AS regards cow's milk the observations of Banerjee and Kothavalla [1940] are that the carotene and vitamin-A contents of butter fat decrease slightly on feeding oilcakes and increase with food rich in carbohydrates and with green grass. Seshan and Sen [1942] have shown that the in- creased carotene in feed is followed by increased carotene and vitamin-A potency of cow's milks whereas Dalip Singh and Fateh Mohammad have observed that vitamin-A value of cow's milk cannot be increased beyond a certain limit. The average vitamin-A value of cow's butter was found 17.7 I.U. per gram of fat and for ghee 14.1 I.U. by Majumdar [1941]. In India the buffalo supplies the bulk of the milk and milk products and is the main dairy animal of the country. Much information about the vitamin-A content of buffalo's milk does not exist. The results given in this paper are the outcome of the work conducted on the vitamin-A potency of the milk during the entire lactation of 12 buffaloes. EXPERIMENTAL Twelve buffaloes of Nili breed were selected and were divided into three groups, A, B and C, with four animals in each group. Group A was fed K25/289 fuzzy American cottonseed, group B K25/289 delinted American cottonseed and Group C desi cotton seed. Records were kept of (a) the live weight and food intake of the buffaloes, (b) the yield and the fat percentage of milk and (c) the nutritive value of milk in vitamin-A potency. Particulars of these buffaloes are given in Table I. All of them calved in September at various dates except Nos. 2 and 4 which calved in October. They were approximately of the same weights and age, and also similar otherwise.

Green fodder was given ad lib, which was about 110 to 130 lb. daily per animal. Green maize was given with about 5 lb. of wheat bhusa, during November and December. 1943. From January to May 1944 green berseem was fed with about 10 lb). of wheat bhusa daily. In addition to the above mentioned roughages, all the animals were given as much cotton seed as they could eat, together with 1 lb. of ground gram and 1 lb. of wheat bran per head p day. The four buffaloes in group A which were fed on fuzzy American cotton seed ate regularly about 6 lb. of cottonseeds per head per day throughout the entire lactation. Of the four buffaloes in group B which were fed on delinted American cottonseed two ate 4 lb. of the seed while the other two would not take more than 2 lb. per head per day. The animals in group C which were fed on desi cotton seed ate up to 8 lb. of cotton seed per head per day. All the animals maintained normal weight with slight increase throughout the period under experiment, their health was excellent, and the yield in every case normal except for animal No. 10 of group C, which died of mammitis. The chemical composition of the cottonseeds fed is given in Table II.

There was a gradual decrease in yield and increase in fat percentage in milk with the advance in lactation. METHODS OF ANALYSIS Vitamin-A. Since the spectrographic equipment was not available, the vitamin-A determina tions were based on the Carr and Price antimony trichloride reaction. The method followed was of Willsteadt and With. To 100 c.c. of well-shaken milk 1/10 of its volume of 60 per cent potassium hydroxide solution was added. The flask was filled with nitrogen. stoppered and vigorously shaken and kept aside for 48 hours with occasional shaking. After that 20 c.c. alcohol were added and
LAL CHAND DHARMANI AND JIWAN DAS CHOPRA 161 the mixture was extracted with peroxide-free ether three times. The combined ether extracts were first washed twice with water, dried through anhydrous sodium sulphate and the ether evaporated in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The residue was taken up in chloroform and made to a suitable volume for colour comparison in Lovibond Tintometer. Carotene. The carotene in green fodders was estimated by Ferguson and Bishop's method [1936]. The finely chopped material was hydrolysed with 20 per cent aqueous potash and the caro- tene and xanthophyll were extracted by means of ethyl ether. From this solution the pigments were taken up with petroleum ether from which the xanthophyll was washed out with methyl alcohol. The carotene was then determined tintometerically. RESULTS The vitamin-A value was determined once a week in a composite sample of the morning and evening milk. The data for Moore blue units per 100 c.c. of milk are shown in Table IV, while Table V gives the percentage of fat in milk. The fat percentage varied between 6.1 and 10.5 and the Moore blue units between 150 to 335. The average of the whole lactation is given in Table VI.

164 A Study of Vitamin A in Buffaloes' Milk throughout a Lactation Except buffalo No. 10 which died of mammitis the blue units per gram of butter fat are almost constant. The average is between 23 and 26.8. The vitamin-A activity dropped with the low per- centage of fat. It appears that there is a general and not an exact relationship between the per- centage of fat and vitamin-A potency of milk. In cow's milk Moore blue units per 100 c.c. varies between 125 and 175, while the value per gram of butter fat is almost identical with buffalo's milk. Buffalo's milk is almost devoid of colour, the carotene being absent in the milk while it is present in sufficient amount to colour cow's milk. Table VIII gives the quantity of carotene fed to the buffaloes in milligrams throughout the lactation. The highest amount of carotene fed to any one animal was 5940 milligrams and the lowest 1700 milligrams during one week. The carotene content of the concentrate mixture in the basal rations was negligible and thus was not taken into consideration.

The feeds employed in these experiments effectively provided sufficient vitamin-A for maintenance and reproduction as well as for the production of butter fat of high vitamin-A activity.
LAL CHAND DHARMANI AND JIWAN DAS CHOPRA 165 Towards the end of lactation the amount of carotene fed was slightly less, probably on account of the low content of carotene in the green maize. The output of vitamin-A (in milligrams) in the milk throughout the lactation is given in Table IX. Vitamin-A has been calculated according to the formula of Bartlett and co-workers [1938]. Because of the limitations in accuracy of the vitamin-A determinations and the calculations involved, these figures may be open to criticism, but they are presented because they give the greatest insight into the quantitative relationship of intake and output at our disposal.

166 A Study of Vitamin-A in Buffaloes' Milk throughout a Lactation The average output of vitamin-A in milk is 4 to 5 milligrams per day. From the data given above there appears to be a response of vitamin-A output in milk when the amount of carotene intake is greater. Thus with the increased intake there is a greater output in vitamin-A in milk. It is not possible to enrich the milk beyond a certain limit by feeding carotene-rich feeds. More work will be undertaken to confirm the results. With a high level of carotene intake the percentage of vitamin-A transmitted in milk is very small. It is interesting to note that each of the buffaloes has, during the entire lactation, yielded less vitamin-A than one day intake of carotene. Though the yield of milk fell at the end of lacta- tion there was no obvious drop in the output of vitamin-A in the milk. The average take of caro- tene per pound of live weight of the buffalo is 2.5 mg., when green fodder is fed ad lib The mini- mum requirements of carotene for buffaloes will be investigated in the near future. SUMMARY A full lactation period of a herd of 12 buffaloes in their fourth lactation is described. The buffaloes were fed definite amounts of fuzzy, delinted American cottonseed and Indian cottonseeds with green fodder ad libitum. There was no difference in the quality and the quantity of milk produced when the buffaloes were fed with the three different types of cottonseeds. There was a general, though by no means an exact, relationship between the butter fat and vitamin-A potency of the milk. The vitamin-A value per gram of butter fat in the buffalo's milk was 23 to 27 in Moore blue units, which is identical with that of cow's milk. Carotene was almost absent in the buffalo milk, but the milk had a higher vitamin-A potency than cow's milk. Increased carotene intake by the buffaloes was followed by the increased vitamin-A potency of milk. The amount of vitamin-A transmitted to buffalo's milk was very small as compared with the intake of carotene, when green fodder was fed ad libitum.

THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COLOSTRUM BUTTERFAT By C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN and ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 29 October 1945) THE first secretion which can be drawn from the udder immediately after parturition (colostrum) is a thick viscous liquid differing greatly in composition from that of the normal milk obtained a week after calving and is known to have an important function in the nutrition of the newly born offspring. This has been ascribed partly to the antibodies supplied to counteract pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal tract, and partly to the vitamin-A potency of the colostrum. Colostrum is generally characterized by a higher proportion of globulin and albumin, a higher percentage of ash and chloride and a lower those content. Mostly the colostral period varies from four to six days [Shah, 1936; Sivasubran am and Dover, 1938]. Some years ago, Drummond et al [1921] pointed out that cow's colostrum contained more vitamin-A than the normal milk produced later in lactation. Dann [1933] studied the vitamin-A content of colostrum samples from 14 milking Shorthorn cows, using colori- metric methods, and for the richest samples biological tests also. He concluded that the vitamin-A concentration in colostrum may be from 10 to 100 times greater than in later milk from the same cow independent of the season. Semb et al [1934] using spectroscopic methods have stated that the high vitamin-A potency of the-colostral milk persists only for a few days after the calf is born before dropping to the normal value, a fact which is confirmed by Gillam et al [1936] and Kunerth et al [1935]. Henry et al [1940] concluded as a result of a study from four Shorthorn cows and nine heifers, that the concentration of vitamin-A in the first colostrum ranged from 8160 to 820 Moore blue units per 100 gm. and that of carotene from 2026 to 411 Moore yellow units per 100 gm. Dann [1933] and Henry et al [1940] obtained higher values of vitamin-A in colostrum from heifers than that from cows. But, Steward and McCallum [1938] working with 100 animals reported that the colostrum from heifers did not contain more vitamin-A than that from cows. They established that the wide range in values was not due to any differences in dietary, breed or date of calving in animals kept under the same conditions of management. It was also suggested that the vitamin-A content of the colostrum might be greatly affected by the length of non-lactating period between successive calvings. It is clear that though much work has been done abroad, no examination of the colostrum from indigenous breeds of cattle appears to have been made. As regards the chemical composition of colostrum butterfat Tchetcheroff [1931] states that the colostral fat shows the same characteristics as milk fat but generally contains more capryllic and capric acids. However, Kurochkin [1927] reported that the R.M. and saponification values of the colostral fat collected 3.5 hours after delivery were lower than those samples collected 48 hours after parturition. Engel et al have also recorded similar results. It is, therefore, obvious from the above that the change or the transition from colostrum to milk, which takes place during the first few days after calving, is a gradual one. Though this change in composition of colostrum has been observed by many workers abroad, no work appears to have been done to note the changes, if any, in the chemical composition of colostral butterfat of indigenous breed of cattle, and it has been thought desirable to carry out some investigation along this line. Therefore, attempts have been made to study the chemical composition, carotene and vitamin-A content of colostral butterfat from Sindhi and Gir cows under the usual feeding conditions. EXPERIMENTAL Colostrum and milk samples for the experiments were obtained from five Sindhi and two Gir cows of the Institute farm fed the regular dairy herd ration. Only animals No. 426 and 424 were in the first lactation. Seven samples were collected from each cow. The first sample was taken a few hours after calving, the second at the following morning milking, and the others at the succes- sive day milkings. Butter was made separately from the colostrum and milk samples by the desi method without the addition of any colouring matter. The process of butter making adopted was the same in all cases and the time taken in its preparation was also the same. It was always found to be difficult to separate out the butter from the first and second day's colostrum samples. As 167
168 The Chemical Composition of Colostrum Butterfat the fat content of the colostrum varied erratically from day to day and since it was not proposed to measure the total output of fat, vitamin-A and carotene, the colostrum was not removed quanta- tively, the results of vitamin-A and carotene were expressed in colour units per gm. of fat. Butter samples were melted into ghee at 116°C. and were analysed for their specific values, namely, R.M., Polenske, Kirschner, Iodine value and butyro refractometer readings at 40°C. by the standard procedure cited before. Vitamin-A determination were made on B.D.H. Lovibond Tinto- meter with Carr-Price reagent vis; unsaponifiable matter [Banerjee, 1936] and the carotene in yellow units per gm. of fat. The results of these determinations are shown in Tables I, II and III. TABLE I Chemical composition of colostral bullerfat Cow No. Days Saponification value B. R. reading R.

From Table I it will be observed that there is a striking difference in the composition of day- to-day colostral butterfat. The saponification number of the butterfat of individual animals col- lected on the first day after parturition varies from 213.2 to 221.3. This value increases as the days advance and tend to become normal after the fifth day. The butyro refractometer reading at 40°C. decreases till the fifth day after which it tends to become normal. The R.M. value of the fat pro- gressively increases day by day starting from as low figures as 7.1, 7.8 and 10.5 in some cases till it comes to the maximum during the fifth day, after which it decreases, reaching a fairly constant figure. The Polenske and Kirschner values also behave similarly. In most of the samples there is a tendency for the iodine value to decrease progressively till the fifth day. The barium values were taken for the samples having very low R.M. values on the first day and they were found to be highly positive (+24.2 and +22.1) ; the values were negative on the fifth and twelfth day. If the R.M. and saponification values were taken into consideration for judging the purity of butterfat the samples collected on the first and second day after parturition could be mistaken as adulterated. No appre- ciable difference in composition is observed between the colostral fats from the Sindhi and Gir cows. When the concentration of vitamin-A is considered there is a marked variation from cow to cow in the highest value recorded on the first day's fat. There is a rapid day-to-day lowering in the vitamin-A value of the colostral fat from individual animals and this process seems to proceed very slowly from the fifth day onwards. Some of the samples were followed till the 30th day and it was found that the vitamin-A was only slightly lowered as compared to the initial days after parturition. The ratio of the amount of vitamin-A in the first day's colostral fat to that of the fifth day sample was found to be about 5. This confirms the findings of Semb et al [1934] who observed the value to be ranging from 5 to 10. Apparently, first day's colostral fat of heifers contains more vitamin-A than that of cows. This is probably due to the heifer having greater reserves of vitamin-A, be- cause the reserves have not been depleted by previous lactation as with cows.
170 The Chemical Composition of Colostrum Butterfat The carotene content of butterfat is known to change with the type of feed, but in the present experiment the feed was the same throughout for all animals. Here too, there is a good deal of in- dividual variation and the concentration decreases rapidly till the fifth day. No marked variation is noticeable in the concentration of carotene between the first day's colostral fat of heifers and cows. Breed variations were also not appreciable, but these results cannot be taken as conclusive as only few animals were tested. The relative importance of colostrum in providing the young of the species with a reserve of vitamin-A is quite evident from the high concentration of this vitamin and its precursor found in colostrum. SUMMARY 1. The changes in the physical and chemical composition of the colostral butte from 7 cows were tested. In general the R.M., Polenske value and saponification number tend ise as days advance whereas the iodine value and refractometer reading fall gradually. 2. The colour of the colostral butterfat especially in the first two days after parturition was deep orange. 3. Colostral fat was about five to six. times richer in carotene and vitamin-A than normal butterfat. 4. Both carotene and vitamin-A decreased rapidly during the first five days, after which the decrease was relatively slow. 5. The amount of vitamin-A in the colostral fat from heifers appeared to be higher than that in the colostral fat of cows. REFERENCES Banerjee (1936). Agric. and Livestock in India 6, 274 Dann (1933).

RANGASWAMY, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 5 November 1945) VARIOUS factors cause variation in the composition of butterfats [ Hagland et al., 1930 ; Kilde and Winther, 1930; Mpolomovsky and Thomas, 1933; Maynard et al, 1936; Groh, 1937]. The effect of feed is an established factI. P. SINGH, T. M. PAUL C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN and M. C. RANGASWAMY, 171 constants. No data seems to be available regarding the effect of the stage of lactation and season of the year on the composition of butterfat of different breeds of Indian cattle. This information is of considerable importance in India particularly in view of the fact that adulteration of ghee is a very common practice and that ghee has to be judged by the analytical constants. The variation of the analytical constants is fairly large and for a proper interpretation of the analytical results it is necessary that one should know the effects of various factors on the constants of the butterfat. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to study the variations in the constants of the butterfat of the different breeds of Indian cattle available at this Institute. EXPERIMENTAL Three animals each of almost the same age, body weight, lactation and milk yeild were selected from the Sindhi, Gir, Tharparkar and Murrah breeds of the Imperial Dairy Research Institute herd. All the animals were almost in the same stage of lactation, i.e. within two and three weeks after parturition. The animals were fed the usual ration that is given to the animals of the Institute herd. The concentrated ration consisted of wheat bran, groundnut cake, gram and gram husk mixed in the proportion of 4.0 : 2.5 : 1.5 : 2.0. This mixture was fed at the rate of one pound for every 2 lb. of milk yielded by the animals. The roughage consisted of a mixture 55 lb. of Guinea and Napier grasses and 3 lb. of ragi straw for cows and 70 lb. of green grass mixture and 3 lb. of ragi straw for buffaloes. A day's milk was collected from each animal separately once a week. The cream was separated for butter making. The butter was melted into ghee at 115°C. and filtered and analysed for R.

172 Variations in the Chemical Constants of the Butterfat TABLE II. P. SINGH, T. M. PAUL 173 TABLE II174 Variations in the Chemical Constants of the Butterfat TABLE IIII. P. SINGH, T. M. PAUL 175 TABLE IV176 Variations in the Chemical Constants of the Butterfat from Murrah buffaloes gave the highest R. M. value when compared to the butterfat from the three breeds of cows studied, and among the cows, Shindhi gave the lowest R. M., whereas Gir and Thar- parkar gave almost similar R. M. values. Polenske values did not show any significant change throughout the lactation. Sindhi cows produced ghee having a Polenske figure averaging 1.8, while it was 1.6 for Gir, 1.5 for Tharparkar and 1.4 for Murrah buffaloes. Individual figures have always been well within the legal limits at all times. The iodine values also did not show any sudden change that could be attributed to season. But there was a gradual increase in the iodine value in the case of all breeds as the lactation advanced. In Sindhi cows the iodine value increased from 29.8 to 31.8, in Gir it increased fr 30.8 to. 32.7, in Tharparkar 31.2 to 32.7 and in Murrah from 28.6 to 30.9. Another point made from Table III is that the Murrah buffaloes produced ghee with the lowest iodine values. Sindhi having a little greater iodine value, Gir and Tharparkar being almost equal but greater than both Sindhi and Murrah. The B. R. reading did not show any significant change due to advance of lactation. The average B. R. reading was 43.0 for Sindhi; 43.7 for Gir, 43.7 for Tharparkar and 42.5 for Murrah. Probably due to the fairly uniform climatic conditions of Bangalore the experiment does not throw any light on the possible changes in the analytical constants of ghee from different breeds that may be brought about by climatic changes. But the effects of the advance of lactation on the chemical constants of the ghee of the four breeds of animals under investigation are quite clearly brought out by the present study. Of the four analytical constants studied R. M. decreases with advance of lactation while iodine value increases at the same time. Polenske value and B. R. read- ing do not seem to be affected by advance in lactation. Even R. M. and Iodine values that are affect- ed do not fall outside their legal limits. Therefore, it is clear that at least in the case of ghee from the four breeds studied, any abnorma y in the analytical constants cannot be attributed to advance in lactation. Sudden and drastic changes in weather and feed may affect the composition of ghee as reported by Plymen and Iyer [1921] but that requires further study under more favourable cir- cumstances. Since the animals in the present investigation were receiving the same diet all through the experimental period the changes observed in R. M. and iodine values have to be attributed only to advance of lactation and not to any change in feed which also produces certain changes in the composition of the butterfat according to Moghul et al [1945]. Again no breed variation is observed in the effect of the advance of lactation on the composition of the butterfat, all the four breeds studied being affected almost in a similar way. SUMMARY (1) Experiments were conducted to study the seasonal variation, if any, in the constants of the butterfat of Sindhi, Gir and Tharparkar cows and Murrah buffaloes. (2) The milk of three animals of each breed was collected separately once a week for the dura- tion of one complete lactation and ghee made out of it and analysed for R. M., Polenske and Iodine values and B. R. reading. (3) No effect was observed on the composition of the ghee that could be attributed to change in season. (4) Advance in lactation is found to affect some of the chemical constants of ghee considerably while some others remain unaffected. The R. M. value decreased and Iodine value increased with the advance in lactation while Polenske value and B. R. reading remained unaffected throughout the lactation. (5) No breed variation is observed in the effect of advance of lactation on the chemical con- stants of ghee all breeds behaving in a similar way. (6) There is no significant difference in the analytical constants of the ghee from the four breeds studied.

ANANTHAKRISHNAN, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Ban- galore (Received for publication on 24 December 1945) ONE of the main reasons for the heat coagulation of evaporated milk during sterilization is the salt balance. Rogers et al [1921] have explained that thickening in condensed milk as due to high calcium and magnesium contents. These workers have also shown that the use of citrates and phosphates has a stabilizing effect by counteracting the effect of high calcium and magnesium contents. The difficulty in overcoming thickening has been found to e more pronounced in the manufac- ture of evaporated buffalo milk than in the case of evaporated cow milk. It is likely that this is cor- related with the state of the calcium present. Calcium in milk is found in both soluble and colloidal forms and also in organic and inorganic combinations and their proportions exercise considerable effect on heat coagulation of evaporated milk. Apart from the data reported by Acharya and Devadatta [1939] no further attention has been paid to this aspect of the problem. For the present studies ten Murrah buffaloes at about the same stage of lactation were selected. Individual samples from each animal were collected once a week and analysed. Also one composite sample was prepared and analysed once a week by mixing equal quantities of milk from each animal. Similarly a composite sample from ten cows was prepared and analysed. Whey was prepared from all these samples by the use of rennet and the amount of calcium was calculated by subtracting the whey calcium from the total calcium of the milk. With whey a correction was made to bring the results from whey percentage to milk percentage by using the correction factor as 9.48. In all 120 samples of milk were analysed including 100 individual samples from ten animals and 20 composite samples from cows and buffaloes. The total calcium was estimated by precipitating with calcium oxalate and then titrating with potassium permanganate in sulphuric acid solution. Whey calcium was estimated by coagulating 100 ml. of milk at 30°C. with 0.7 ml. of liquid rennet. The curd was cut with stainless steel knife and the whey allowed to drain off. The whey was filtered through Whatman No. 40 filter paper. To 25 ml. of this whey were added 100 ml. of 10 per cent trichloroacetic acid solution with constant stirring. 100 ml. of the filtrate were neutralized with ammonia and acidified with dilute acetic acid. Ammonium chloride was added and the calcium precipitated from the hot solution with solid ammonium oxalate and estimated by titrating with permanganate as for total calcium. For converting whey percentage figures to milk percentage figures the value was multiplied by the factor 100 [fat percentage + (protein percentage178 Nature of Calcium in Buffalo Milk TABLE I Calcium distribution in the milk of buffaloes and cows (gm. per 100 ml.)

This is confirmed by the results obtained from the analysis of the composite weekly samples of milk wherein the colloidal form of calcium accounted for 77.49 per cent of the total calcium. The composite samples of cow milk obtained from Sindhi cows and analysed in a similar manner were found to contain on an average 67.09 per cent of total calcium in colloidal form. The results show that buffalo milk contains a higher percentage of calcium, about 77.2 per cent of which is in colloidal form. This probably explains the comparatively low heat stability of eva- porated buffalo milk as compared to cow milk. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks are due to Dr N. N.

Sci. 10, 221181 GOAT DERMATITIS : A NEW VIRUS DISEASE OF GOATS IN INDIA By J. R. HADDOW and J. A. IDNANI, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 2 April 1946) (With Plates VII and VIII) THIS article describes the circumstances under which the disease was discovered, the main clinical features and post-mortem findings, the aetiology and possible means of control. Although the investigation is not complete, the present moment seems opportune to draw attention to the disease, so that it may be recognized and its incidence and epizootiology recorded, as at present we have no information these points. OCCURRENCE During studies on cross-immunity reactions using sheep and goat-pox virus strains, we observed that some of our discarded stock goat immunes were dying from an infection which was reported to be goat-pox. On going into the matter we found that, though this condition on casual examina- tion might be mistaken for an aberrant type of goat-pox such as has not infrequently been reported in India, there were several easily recognized clinical features which made us doubt the accuracy of the original diagnosis. Simultaneously we discovered the same disease in goats which were being used on experimental work other than goat-pox, and reference to records yielded the additional information that a similar condition had existed at Mukteswar in the healthy goat stocks on two previous years during the monsoon period. Since the investigation started, two outbreaks of goat dermatitis have been observed in the healthy stocks; both apparently arose from outside sources and both occurred during the monsoon. Also out of a number of specimens received at this Institute for confirmation of the diagnosis of goat- pox, one originating in the United Provinces and, one reported to be from an outbreak of pneu- monia in goats in Sind proved to be aetiologically identical with the condition which was under study at Mukteswar. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS In natural cases the first symptoms observed are general malaise accompanied by a high tem- perature and rough staring coat. On examination, the skin is found to be studded with numerous round elevated areas distributed over the body surface (Plate VII, figs. 1 and 2) and extending on to the lips, gums and tongue. Simultaneously or within a day or two, symptoms of pneumonia appear and death follows invariably. In cases artificially produced by rubbing dilute emulsions of tissue from the stud-like nodules on to the scarified skin of healthy goats there is an incubation period of seven to ten days, after which the scarified area shows sharply circumscribed circular hyperaemic areas and simultaneously the temperature rises two to three degrees. The hyperaemia rapidly increases, the area becomes thick- ened and elevated, and within 48 hours there is a hard stud of rubbery consistence and black colour. The nodules are approximately 4-12 mm. in diameter and raised about 1182 Goat Dermatitis. A new Virus Disease of Goats in India MORBID ANATOMY The skin lesions previously described are a constant feature. On opening the carcase, typical lesions can in almost all cases be observed in the alimentary tract, lungs and kidneys. The internal lesions are essentially similar to those seen on the skin. In the alimentary tract, the abomasum is almost invariably affected. The duodenum, lips, gum and tongue, oesophagus, large intestine and rectum are also frequently affected, the frequency being in that order. In these locations the nodules are greyish-white or yellow in colour and usually smaller in diameter than those seen on the skin. In the later stages the mucous membrane is desquamated leaving a bright red punched-out ulcer. The liver is more rarely affected and the lesions present the appearance of in cts. In the respiratory tract, lesions are as frequent as in the abomasum and are present on the face of the trachea and larger bronchiIndian J. vet.

J. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 183 Blood is also infective from the time the temperature rises until the temperature drops in chronic cases. We have also to record negative results in transmission experiments with four Bhutia goats (a long-haired variety from the Himalayan hinterland). Whether these goats were naturally immune cannot be said, as these goats are only supplied to the Institute during the winter months. We have also no information as to the natural method of transmission in local breeds of goats. It is peculiar that, although in nature the disease seems to spread readily enough, healthy goats have been left in contact with artificially infected ones at all stages of the disease for long periods without acquiring the disease. Later, they were found to be fully susecp ble to artificial inoculation. AETIOLOGY The circumstances in which the disease was found led us to suspect a virus as the probable cause, and filtration experiments with emulsions of nodules confirmed this suspicion. Infective bacteria- free filtrates were readily obtained from Berkefeld V, Chamberland L1, L2, L3 candles. Cultural examination for bacteria at the early stages of the lesions was also uniformly negative. The virus is present in the skin lesions throughout the course and has been recovered from the scabs more than three weeks after the original inoculation. Virus in dried scabs or in tissues stored in 50 per cent glycerol remains viable for at least 16 months at 0184 Goat Dermatitis. A new Virus Disease of Goats in India Following intravenous inoculation with skin material, symptoms of general malaise with high temperature, 104°-106°F., and rough staring coat mark the onset of the disease. On careful exami- nation the skin is studded with small circular, elevated nodules distributed all over the surface ex- tending to the lips, eyelids and tongue. Simultaneously or within a day or two, symtoms of pneu- monia appear and death follows invariably. At no stage of development of the skin nodules does vesiculation or pustule formation occur. Extension of lesions takes place into the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Greyish white nodules are mainly seen in the lungs, abomasum and often through- out the intestines. The foci in the lungs set up an apparently secondary pneumonia almost as quickly as they appear and produce early death. The disease was easily transmitted with blood or material from skin lesions subcutaneously, intravenously or by scarification to pox mune goats. Bulls, sheep, rabbits and guinea-pigs proved refractory. Light scarification on the incrase of the ear with the virus sets up a localized lesion and is suggested as possible means for prophylaxis.

Annual Report of the Director of Veterinary Department, Federated Malay States, 39 DEFINITION OF BARODA WOOL GRADES by N. L. NARAYAN, G. V. Sc., Wool Improvement Officer and SUNANDA. B. Sc., Wool Analysis Laboratory, Baroda State (Received for Publication on 16 February 1945) THE Indian Wood trade-names like Joria and Bikaneri denote the tract from which the wool is collected. At present there are different breeds of sheep coexisting. Nomadic sheep which have to move far in search of pasture are shorn at different places at different season. Also there is a great deel of variation from sheep to sheep and region to region of a fleece so that the wool produced in an area is a mixture of different types and qualities. Added to this natural dis- advantage, the crude methods of shearing and collection further deteriorate the value of the wool resulting in great financial loss to all concerned. The producer is too ignorant to improve upon this state of marketing of his product. The middlemen are not interested as they are satisfied with the commission they are already earning. The manufacturers though interested are too far removed from the wool growers and the primary collecting centres of wool to exercise proper control over it, especially as alternative products are available. The duty therefore falls upon the State to take up this question and make a systematic and effective start in this line. Accordingly, the Baroda Government had a survey of the whole State carried out under the following heads: 1. Sheep breeds and their distribution; 2. Wool quality of sheep of different areas; 3. Local conditions of sheep husbandry; and 4. System of collection and sale of wool. This survey not only pointed out that the conditions of sheep husbandry and wool collection were backward, but also brought to light the existance of large numbers of fine woolled sheep in northern Gujrat and Kathiawad which guaranteed an increased income to the producers immediately if only their wool could be sorted out and sold in a pure form.
N. L. NARAYAN AND SUNANDA 185 Following this discovery a marketing organization was included in the Wool Improvement Scheme to conduct experiments on shearing, garding, collection and sale of wool on a large scale, along with other developmental activities, to work on Pattanwadi sheep in northern Gujerat to start with. The number of sheep dealt with by this section rose from 11,000 in the first year to 65,000 in the third year. The Australian system of grading was adopted as the model and skirting and classing were carried out immediately after shearing at the shearing yard. Taking into consideration both individual and regional variations in the wool quality of the sheep of the whole tract, it was possible to form five distinct classes, ' super ', ' first ' and ' second ' in white and 'colour' and 'skirtings' in coloured wool. There is doubt that the distinctness and uniformity within each grade depends much on the efficiency of assers. To find out how far this was successful and in what directions the quality of. each class and be controlled, systematic laboratory analysis was conducted of the two top grades for two consecutive collections. The qualities of various types of cotton have been standardized and agmarking has been introduced, but so far no such attempts have been made to classify wool. This study explores the possibilities and suggests a method of such standardization and agmarking of Indian wools and in particular Pattanwadi wools in Baroda State. Samples were collected from four different corners of ten. bags selected at random of each quality of two consecutive collections and each of these four samples was brought down to a few hundred fibres by dividing and discarding and these four bunches of fibres were combined to form one sample representing a bag and the ten samples representing the entire consignment of one quality. Table I gives the results of analysis of these samples for the two collections.

L. NARAYAH AND SUNANDA 187 While the difference between the two classes is not marked, the difference between the two collections in both the classes is apparent. The difference in length between wools of two seasons, Autumn and Spring has, been observed on individual sheep also taking into account exactly six months' clip. Keeping in view that both these classes of wool are clothing types, it does not seem to be profitable to introduce distinctness in length until the breed is highly developed as it will thin down the quantity, but different standards will have to be adopted for the clips of different seasons as 2.5 in and above for spring and 3.5 in. and above for autumn. The coefficient of variation should be restricted to 20 per cent as shown by the majority of the samples. Crimp. he mean number of crimps per inch of the samples vary as follows : First Super Autumn . . . . . . 5 to 7 5 to 8 Spring . . . . 5 to 9 7 to 9 As in length, the difference in average number of crimps per inch of fibre between the two classes is not marked but the difference between the two collections is apparent, the spring clip being crimpier in both the classes than that of the autumn clip. Such a difference has also been observed in wools of individual animals. While different standards for the two classes do not seem to be practicable, minimums can be adopted for the two clips as 5 and above for autumn and 6 and above for spring. Medullation. In this study medullation was estimated by counting the number of medullated fibres appearing during diameter record, taking into account different degrees of medullation.

Most of these died within three to four days of arriving in Calcutta ; in others the course was more protracted. POST-MORTEM There was general emaciation and various parasites were found, such as Haemonchus contortus, Oesophagostomes, Cysticercus tenuicollis, Gongylonema pulchrum, Cotylophoron cotylophorum. Oestrus ocis larvae were present, often in large numbers, in the nasal cavity and in the paranasal (especially frontal) sinuses but none was found actually lodged in the brain or in the cranial cavity. Coenurus cerebralis was not found. In two cases brownish-red mottling, and in one case ecchymotic haemorrha- ges were found in the brain tissue. A few cases of suspicious fatty changes in the liver were also seen. Of the 13 uteri examined, 11 were gravid, the foetuses being usually past midterm. DIAGNOSIS No bacteriological or biological transmission experiments could be carried out. Histopatholo- gical examination of two brains showed no noteworthy abnormalities. DISCUSSION The measures which were adopted and which reduced the mortality to almost nil in subsequent batches were (1) purchasing of healthy-looking non-pregnant sheep only, (2) proper feeding, watering and general care during transport, (3) suitable housing facilities and nourishing feed provided on arrival at Calcutta. The syndrome of nervous symptoms in some cases, when considered along with the fact that quite a few pregnant sheep were affected, led us to suspect pregnancy toxaemia, but due to lack of confirmatory evidence, it is not possible to be dogmatic on the point. Other possibilities such as hypocalcaemia, hookworms, etc. were o considered. Elder [1942] states that hypocalcaemia may cause death after driving or travelling long distances or yarding for a long period without food. The fact that improvement in feeding reduced the mortality shows that the cause was some metabolic disturbance due to temporary enforced fasting and its cumulative effects. Franklin and MacGregor [1944], while investigating the causes of the death of merino rams after long journeys by rail, found that the rams on arrival have inflex appearance, depressed and fickle appetite with loss of condition and a characteristic stance with back arched, the hind legs fairly well forward beneath the body and the head held low and disinclination to move. They concluded that adequate roughage and preliminary education in trough feeding would assist rams to withstand the conditions of transport including the primary and secondary effects of unavoidable periods of fasting during transit. In an experiment in which a group of 100 rams was fed for a period of 10 days on a mixture of chaff and concentrates before being trucked, all of them arrived at their destination in excellent condition after a journey of 17 days. This sustained the belief that hypocalcaemia does not play a major part in the syndrome but it is possible that some of the sporadic cases which occur in the trucks may result from acute hypocalcaemia or so-called transit tetany. Franklin and Reid [1944] state that care should be exercised in feeding linseed nuts as in some cases sheep may arrive in a healthy condition yet by consuming these in large quantities a sufficient amount of HCN may be produced to cause death.

KRISHNA IYER, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 18th April 1946) ( With Plate IX ) IN a previous article [Shirlaw, 1939] summarized reports on contagious bovine pleuropneumonia from the provinces, extending over a period of 50 years, and stated, in conclusion, that no direct evidence of the existence of the disease in India was availabe. Further work now shows the disease to exist in Assam. The disease has acquired the name 'Brahmaputra Valley Disease' owing to its prevalence in the area. It is sporadic and occasional in this area, the probable explanation being that the country is divided by the river into numerous small islands, each with its groups of villages. These isolated agricultural settlements, called chars afford no contact between cattle of adjoining chars except through occasional cattle fairs, which, apparently, are the origin of fresh outbreaks and new centres of infection. The disease runs an acute course, usually of one to three weeks with a mortality said to be 100 per cent. The carrier problem does not, apparently, exist and this may account for the periodicity of the disease in char lands. Buffaloes are not affected. The statement that the disease has spread rapidly in Assam in recent years is somewhat conflicting and such figures as are available would hardly support the statement. During some years the incidence may be higher than in others, but accurate data are not available. The neighbouring province of Bengal is said to be free, largely because there is little movement of cattle between the two provinces. STRAINS OF THE VIRUS The original Assam strain (Assam 1 virus) came as crude lymph virus from an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (October, 1939) in district Balishapara. This was of relatively feeble virulence when received, but acquired full virulence after a few passages in Kumaoni cattle. The second strain (Assam 2 virus), obtained for comparative study, came from an outbreak in Majuly district, about 300 miles from Balish? para. Both samples when tested by the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam, provoked classic lesions on subcutaneous inoculation of Assamese calves. Four African strains designated Kenya Narok, Kenya V4, Kenya ML and Rhodesian R manual were later received from Kenya. Kenya Narok strain was a 46th generation culture, Kenya V4 sctain was a 15th subculture from a 2nd animal passage, Kenya ML strain was a 2nd subculture from a 4th animal passage and Rhodesian R natural strain was a 35th generation culture. No information was received on the reaction of these strains in Kenya cattle, although it was stated that Kenya Narok and Rhodesian R. strains has been successfully used in vaccination. These strains were approximately three weeks in transit and proved viable in subculture in Bennett's broth. They were subcultured at 7-day intervals for nine more generations and then used in immunity experiments described later. About the same time, two bovine pleuropneumonia culture vaccine strains, labelled 173 and 264 were received from Australia. These cultures were ten weeks in transit; both grew satisfactorily when subcultured in Bennett's broth and one culture (264) proved, as will be seen later, highly pathogenic in Kumaoni cattle. Strain 264 was a 63rd, and strain 173 a 72nd generation culture in B.V.F.O.S. medium. Both these strains had been used successfully in the vaccination of Australian cattle. Culture media. Bennett's medium has proved, in our hands, to be the medium of choice for primary isolation and maintenance of the Assam bovine pleuropneumonia organism. The formula of this medium is beef-heart meat extract with addition of 2 per cent 'Difco' bactopeptone and 0.5 per cent pure Nacl, the pH being adjusted at 7.4. After sterilization in bulk, the medium is tubed in 5 c.c. quantities, the tubes autoclaved and, when cool, 0.5 c.c. sterile horse serum added to each A 191
192 Bovine on Pleuropneumonia tube. Considerable initial difficulty was experienced in obtaining surface cultures of the Assam pleuropneumonia virus on Bennett's serum agar until the simple technique of Wright [1933] was followed, viz. extracting the minced heart muscle and peptone together at 5°C. for 24-48 hours instead of preparing the extract first and adding the peptone later. On the other hand, we had no difficulty in obtaining primary suface cultures of the Australian strains on solid medium prepared according to Bennett's original formula. The choice of the serum used in the preparation of the medium is, in our experience, a matter of some importance. The serum of Kumaoni cattle is unsatisfactory in comparison with horse serum; growth of the Assam organism is relatively poor and primary isola- tion from Berkefeld V filtrates frequently fails in Bennett's medium containing cattle serum. Austra- lian strains, however, grow in the medium equally well whether it contains cattle or horse serum. It has also been our experience that all samples of horse serum, are not equally conducive to growth of the Assam organism; one sample seemed definitely inhibitory, one was of mediocre value and only one of three samples tested was really satisfactory. B.V.F.O.S. medium, a special culture medium favoured by Australian workers [Turner, Campbell and Dick, 1935] gave poorer results than Bennett's medium. Our experience of the medium was, however, limited to one batch (difficulty, lay in obtain- ing fresh pig stomach) and further work with this medium might have produced better results. This medium is a modification of Martin's broth, the first medium incidentally in which growth of the bovine pleuropneumonia organism was observed. Edwards (unpublished work) working with a strain of foreign origin, used a similar medium in his studies on the bovine pleuropneumonia organism at Mukteswar and claimed excellent results. Purchase (personal communication) has evolved a special cooked blood-agar medium (formula not stated), which is easy to prepare and on which colonies of the bovine pleuropneumonia organism develops satisfactorily. We have found that minute colonies just visible with a pocket lens (X 10) develop in ordinary cooked blood-agar slants, provided the medium is freshly made and such medium sown from a growth well established in Bennett's serum broth. However, this medium could not be recommended for routine work. Conditions of reduced oxygen tension (+10 or +20 per cent) do not enhance the value of Bennett's serum agar medium, SUSCEPTIBILITY Bovines (a) Kumaoni cattle. These are highly susceptible to the subcutaneous inoculation of crude lymph virus. The percentage of 'Takes' is considerably higher than that recorded in Kenya cattle [Purchase, 1939]. Although the Kumaon Hills are known to be free from contagious bovine pleuro- pneumonia, yet the reaction of local animals to subcutaneous inoculation of the Assam 1 virus (crude lymph) is somewhat erratic. Thus of a total of fifty-nine cattle used in the propagation of the virus, the results in fifty-three animals that reacted and died were: Incubation period No. reacting Reaction period Average 5 days and under . . . . . . . 31 6-14 days 9.3 days 6-10 days . . . . . . . . . 15 10-34 J. F. SHIRLAW AND P. R. KRISHNA IYER 193 one month similarly did not influence its reactivity. One point worthy of mention is the irregular and unpredictable reaction in Kumaoni cattle in the plains at Izatnagar. The virus could not be propagated in cattle during the summer months, while in winter the reactions did not materially differ from those encountered in cattle at Mukteswar. Kumaoni cattle are also susceptible to the inoculation of blood of cattle reacting to the subcutaneous inoculation of crude lymph virus. In the first test, two cattle were subcutaneously inoculated with 5 c.c. blood from a routine virus pro- ducer at the 15th day of reaction. One animal reacted as typically as if inoculated with fresh lymph virus and the second failed to react. In the second test, three cattle were similarly inoculated with blood from a second virus producer; the first animal was inoculated at the 3rd day of reaction, the second at the 9th and the third at the 14th day. All three test cattle reacted typically with incubation period of eight, fourteen and eleven days and the interval, between inoculation and death fifteen, twenty five and twenty days respectively. The test was repeated with blood from a third virus producer with negative results. Kumaoni cattle proved susceptible to the intravenous inocula- tion of crude lymph virus; seven animals were thus inoculated with 5 c.c. virus and only one failed to react. Four animals developed acute pleuropneumonia with typical lesions of the disease, the virus being readily isolated. The incubation period of the four cases averaged four to five days and the interval between inoculation and death was twenty-six days. Two animals succumbed to acute piroplasmosis during the period of reaction A preliminary attempt in three cattle to transmit the disease by liberally spraying the nares with fresh lymph virus failed, no reaction being observed over a period of two months. According to Campbell [1938], pleuropneumonia may be fairly easily transmitted to susceptible cattle following exposure in a well-sealed room to an atmosphere heavily sprayed with fresh virus. An attempt to confirm this work in susceptible kumaoni cattle failed. Four cattle were placed in a room of 810 Cu. ft. dimension, which was then heavily sprayed by means of an electrically operated paint spray gun with 1200 c.c. fresh lymph virus. The room was hermetically sealed for 24 hours and then opened. The test animals were observed for six months, but none showed any sign of having acquired infection, nor were any lesions of the disease seen at post-mortem. To infect cattle by the intra- tracheal route also proved impossible. One of three cattle as inoculated with 2 c.c. fresh lymph virus developed an extensive local reaction with fever which was undoubtedly the result of faulty inoculation; no sign of internal metastasis was seen on autopsy of this case. The remaining animals showed no reaction over two months. In our experience, the disease is capable of spread by direct contact. Six Kumaoni cattle were placed for 12 days with a Kumaoni bull which was infected and subsequently died of extensive pleuropneumonia. Three months later two of the six cattle exposed to infection were noticed to be emaciated and coughing. In both cases severe lesions of contagious pleuropneumonia were found at post-mortem. Kumaoni cattle could not be infected by feeding the Assam 1 virus. Three animals were drenched with 100 c.c. fresh virus and no reaction was observed over a period of six months. Kumaoni cattle subcutaneously inoculated with Assam 2 virus reacted as cattle in the Assam 1 virus series; the number of cattle inoculated was, however, much less (seven as comparesd with fifty-three). The incubation period ranged from 5-14 days, and the reaction period averaged 6.8 days. As previously mentioned, two vaccine strains (Nos. 173 and 264) were received from Australia. In the first batch of Kumaoni cattle subcutaneously inoculated with these two strains, two cattle reacted strongly to vaccine strain 264, and the lymph virus so obtained was serially passaged in 25 cattle, with the following results: Incubation period No. reacting Reacting period Average 2-5 days . . . . . . . . 17 6-15 days 10.7 days 6-7 194 Bovine on Pleuropneumonia One animal recovered from the reaction and one failed to react, thus giving a positive reaction of 96 per cent and a mortality rate of 92 per cent. The reaction was as in cattle tested with the two strains of Assam virus. (b) Indian buffalo. One buffalo inoculated subcutaneously with 2 c.c. fresh Assam 1 lymph virus showed no reaction over a period of six months. A second buffalo similarly inoculated with 5 c.c. virus developed a typical local and thermal reaction, the former of 31 and the latter of 14 days' duration. The swelling ultimately softened and ruptured, and the animal recovered. Goats A considerable number of goats has been tested with Assam virus and the reaction is practically constant.

In our opinion no one has, as yet, devised a method of demonstrating the organism in tissues. This is all the more remarkable, since it is not difficult to demonstrate the organism in fresh lung films by the long Giemsa method. Indeed, this is the most direct method of establishing a diagnosis; similar- ly, the organism can be demonstrated, if less abundantly, in the pleural effusion and we consider paracentesis with (a) microscopic examination of the effusion and (b) cultural isolation of the organism a neglected method of direct diagnosis. (2) In lung sections stained by Hiadenhain's iron hæmatoxylin or by Nicolle's carbol-thionin blue we have seen, at a magnification X 1400 and chiefly within the stromal exudate, homogeneous clusters of what appear to be the elementary bodies described in studies on the morphology of the organism. (3) Tissue eosinophilia of a type seen in actinomycotic lesions is a constant feature of the histopathology of the lung in contagious bovine pleurophneumonia. The experimental local lesion is a spreading, exudative myositis involving, in some cases, muscles of the limb, abdomen and even head and neck. The associated lymph glands are grossly 196 Bovine on Pleuropneumonia nutrition of the part, thus inhibiting any potential fibroblastic activity. As we could not correlate these lesions with any known pathological condition of the spleen of cattle, and as the lesion is strictly comparable with the classic pleuropneumonia lesions elsewhere described, there is apparently consider- able justification for describing the lesion as one not hitherto recorded in studies in pathogenesis. That the spleen lesion contains the virus was shown by the fact that two hill cattle subcutaneously inoculated with a saline extract of spleen lesion reacted as if inoculated with fresh lymph virus and succumbed. Two hill cattle each inoculated with a large dose (100 c.c.) of a Berkefeld V filtrate of the same extract failed to react, but both proved immune to a later immunity test in which the control reacted typically and died. In thirty four of forty eight Kumaoni cattle, i.e. 71 per cent of the series of cattle subcutaneously inoculated with Assam 1 virus, one of the main lesions has been a profound oedema and occasionally ulceration of the mucous membrance of the abomasum, the folds being grossly swollen with a clear, amber-coloured exudate clotting rapidly on removal. In a few cases, other parts of gastro- intestinal tract, especially the large intestine, have been likewise affected. When the rectum is involved, there is usually a tendency for ulceration and haemorrhage. The lesions are frequently accompanied by a more extensive sero-fibrinous infiltration of the adventitious coat. At Izatnagar, these lesions were found in four of twenty i.e. 20 per cent cattle inoculated subcutaneously with the Assam 1 virus. The presence of the virus in the J. F. SHIRLAW AND P. R. KRISHNA IYER 197 negative pressure of 50 mm. mercury. Filtration was slow, taking 90 minutes for the passage of 250 c.c. fluid. Three cattle were subcutaneously inoculated with 5, 10 and 15 c.c. filtrate respectively and no reaction was observed over a period of 25 days. The test was repeated in two cattle, each being given subcutaneously 225 c.c. Berkefeld N filtrate of a different sample of fresh lymph diluted 1/50 saline; the result was again negative. All five animals were later tested for immunity, the first batch 25 days and the second batch 110 days after inoculation. The three animals tested at the 25th day reacted to a test dose of 2 c.c. fresh lymph virus given subcutaneously and died, whereas the two animals similarly tested at the 110th day showed a strong immunity, both controls to the test reacting fatally. Later work showed that the organism cannot be isolated in culture from Berkefeld N filtrates of lymph virus and the presumptive evidence from this small-scale ex- periment is; (a) some degree of immunity is obtained in susceptible cattle following the subcutaneous inoculation of lymph virus filtrates proved free of the causal organism; the immunity so conferred being possibly antitoxic; (b) immunity is of slow development, a fact which has been commented on by several workers while discussing immunity in general. Further filtration experiments showed that the organism in lymph virus passed and L3 and occasionally an L5 but not an L7 filter, whilst results with a Seitz E. K. filter were erratic and seemed to depend on the degree of positive pressure. The Assam 1 virus was used in these experiments. (B) Culture We have consistently failed to isolate the organism in culture from filtrates of lymph virus stored for more than a week at 5°C. The Assam organism is much more exacting in its cultural require- ments than the Australian 264 strain, which has been studied in equal detail. The most direct method of obtaining primary culture of the Assam organism is to incubate at 37°C. a few c.c. Berkefeld V filtrate of fresh lymph virus. In 2-3 days the clear filtrate has acquired a faint opalescence and a few drops of this material inoculated in Bennett's broth yields visible growth within 48 hours. This procedure is recommended for primary isolation of the organism from filtrates as cultures from direct filtrates of lymph virus are feeble in comparison, more slow growing, and sometimes fail. Further, the growth phases of the organism are better studied by dark-ground illumination in in- cubated filtrates than in culture media rich in serum; the manner in which artefacts liable to be confused with these growth phases tend to appear in serum media has been commented on by many workers [Titze and Seelemann, 1921; Freiberger, 1912; Merling-Eisenberg, 1935; and others]. The Assam organism will grow feebly in Bennett's broth with 1 per cent added horse serum when it has adapted itself to a medium with 10 per cent added serum. Cultures cannot, however, be passaged or maintained in 1 per cent serum medium, nor will growth occur in this medium if the seed material is a Berkefeld V filtrate of lymph virus. At the other range, the Assam organism will not grow in Bennett's broth with 20 per cent added serum. It seems that a 10 per cent serum concentra- tion is optimal. Maximum growth occurs at pH. 7.4-7.8; a pH below 7.2 or above 8 will not permit growth of the organism. The inoculation of three drops of Berkefeld V incubated filtrate of Assam lymph virus in Bennett's broth results in visible growth within three days, this showing as a faint opalescence which is best seen in contrast with incubated controls. The opalescence daily increases and growth seems maximal in ten to fourteen days. On gently shaking the culture, a delicate sedi- ment of growth ascends as a spiral veil. This cultural character is noteworthy. Cultures older than three weeks undergo some degree of clearing and the sediment becomes decidedly granular. Surface growth on Bennett's serum agar seems conditioned to no little extent by the hygroscopic qualities of the medium, and the Assam organism is exacting in this respect. The correct texture of the medium can only be judged by experience. Dewdrop-like, glistening, smooth colonies are first visible on the third day after inoculation and incubation at 37.5 C. The colony gradually en- larges to about ½ mm. and buds off daughter colonies (Plate IX, fig. 3). Viewed at a magnification of x 40, the umbonate centre is granular and somewhat opaque, and the outer part of the colony transparent (Plate IX, fig. 4).The colony is adherent to the medium in about a week. This phase does not seem, as stated by some workers, confined to older cultures and is not conditioned by gradual desiccation of the medium. Following heavy inoculation with filtrate an irregular film of metallic sheep slowly develops, a cultural character which we have not seen previously described, and which
198 Bovine on Pleuropueumonia was also observed in cultures of the Australian 264 organism. The morphology of the organism has been studied in Berkefeld V filtrates incubated 12-48 hours. Overnight Giemsa has proved the most satisfactory stain. Our observations on the morphology of the Assam organism correspond so closely with standard descriptions [Ledingham, 1933; Tang et al, 1935; and others] that only the following essential features need be given. There are four main growth phases : 1. Extremely delicate filaments are just visible at a magnification X 1,000. Within the filaments and especially at the terminations, tiny nodes are seen. The filaments undergo dichotomous branching and ripening of the nodes to spores is characteristic of this stage. A fine mucoid sheath, staining bright pink, is condensed at the centre of the branching process and invests the filaments for a short distance (Plate IX fig. 5).3. The filaments disintegrate, releasing masses of ripe spores. These are often held together by the mucoid substance to form small streptococcal-like chains. 4. Maturation is succeeded by germination of the spores. These swell and acquire triangular, circular and somewhat polyhedral shapes. On the contour, especially at angles, new chromatin condensations appear. From these germinal centres new filaments develop. The 'asterococcal' forms of the organism, e.g. filaments radiating from a germinal centre, may be fairly easily seen in Giemsa. stained films prepared from the sediment of fresh lymph virus centrifuged at a speed of not more than 3,000 revolutions per minute for 15 minutes.

All four animals were tested for immunity, the first two cattle 50 days p.i. and the other two 46 days p.i., with 3 c.c. homologous virulent lymph virus subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder along with one control. The reaction to the test dose was, in all four animals, extreamely severe, hypersensitiveness rather than immunity having, apparently, been created; death occurred in every case, as well as in the control animal. Tail-tip vaccination. In the first test, six cattle were used. Three were inoculated subcutane- ously about one inch above the tail tip with 0.5 c.c. eitht-day old 8th generation Bennett Broth culture of the Assam 1 organism. The other three cattle were similarly inoculated, at the same time, with 0.1 c.c. virulent lymph virus. Both batches were given a reinforcing dose, tail tip, 13 days later, the first lot 1 c.c. of the same culture and the second lot 0.5 c.c. of the same virus, the materials having been maintained at 5°C. between the intervals of inoculation. In the culture- inoculated animals no reaction was observed. In the virus-inoculated batch, one animal developed fever three days before the reinforcing dose was due and reacted so severely that death followed 24 days after the first inoculation. Typical lesions of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia were seen at post-mortem and the virus from this case was passaged. In a second animal of this batch, inflamma- tion of the tail commenced two days after the reinforcing dose and increased in intensity for four days when the lesion ruptured; necrosis slowly developed and the tail sloughed 26 days later. In the third animal of this batch, inflammation of the tail likewise developed after the reinforcing dose; four days later the lesion ruptured and healing was complete in nine days. All three animals of the first batch and the two survivors of the second were tested for immunity fifty-nine days after the first inoculation, the test dose being 2 c.c. virulent Australian 264 lymph virus subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder. None of the five animals reacted to the test dose and were solidly immune, two controls reacting fatally. A second test was carried out with seven cattle. Each animal was given 0.5 c.c. 6th generation culture subcutaneously one inch from the tail tip and one month later five of these animals were given a reinforcing dose, by the same route, of 1 c.c. 8th generation culture. No reaction to vaccination was noted in any of the seven animals and 148 days after the first inoculation all were tested with 2 c.c. homologous virulent virus, along with 1 control, subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder. (This immunity test was adopted as standard.) The control reacted severely but survived and five of the seven cattle tested did not react and were thus immune to the homologous virus; the remaining two cattle were partially immune. Both reacted to the test dose with an incubation period of four days, but in neither case was there any systemic reaction and the local lesion sloughed early. Ordinarily, as we have already noted, sloughing of the local lesion and absence of systemic reaction is followed by recovery, but in both animals secondary local sepsis and maggot infestation of the wounds necessitated destruction. The indications were, in this test, that immunity is conferred with a single dose of culture and that a reinforcing dose is probably unnecessary. In an attempt to ascertain whether tail tip vaccination with Assam 2 strain culture could protect against Assam 1 strain virus, three cattle were inoculated tail tip with 0.5 c.c. 5th generation Assam 2 culture; the inoculation was repeated a week later with 1 c.c. 6th generation Assam 2 culture and 37 days later all three animals were tested with one control with 0.5 c.c. Assam 1 lymph virus. The control reacted severely and died and none of the three vaccinated animals showed any sign of reaction. Vaccination with lymph virus stored for 15 weeks at 5°C. It has been shown that the Assam 1 strain lymph virus conserves its virulence at +5°C. for about three months and that there is some evidence based on test in one animal, that further storage of the material at the same temperature for three months and twenty-five days resulted in its apparent attenuation. Moreover, the immunity test of this animal suggested that a virus so attenuated might be of considerable value in vaccination. This hypothesis was tested in thirteen cattle; ten were subcutaneously inoculated at the point of the shoulder with 2 c.c. Assam 1 lymph virus stored at +5°C. for 15 weeks, and to test the relative safety of this product two cattle were given 40 c.c. and one 20 c.c. by the same route, the latter animal being inoculated ten days after inoculation of the main batch with the same sample of lymph virus further stored for this period. None of the animals so vaccinated showed any reaction, either local or general, and all were tested for immunity with two controls 224 days (the last animal 214 days)

Workers on the problem of immunity are generally agreed that vaccination by 'culture virus' is the most satisfactory method of control of the disease in the field. The method depends on the fact that continued subculture of the organism results in gradual attenuation, a stage in attenuation being reached at which the inoculation of sus- ceptible cattle is harmless, although productive of immunity. The culture so attenuated retains its immunizing properties through a considerable number of generations until, finally, these are lost or weakened to such extent as to be of little value. Workers in Africa [Hayes, 1926 ; Walker, 1922; Bennett, 1932; and others] have found that the use of culture virus earlier than the 16th generation is dangerous, occasionally producing fatal reactions. Culture virus older than the 73rd generation is of diminished potency and, therefore, of little value save in protecting specially sus- ceptible herds when, of course, it must be employed. Between these stages of attenuation there is said to be little variation in immunizing values, although Bennett [1932] states that earlier cultures give a more satisfactory immunity than later. The method depends for its success in great part, however, on the relative susceptibility of cattle populations in any given area and the strain of the vaccine used. Even in countries where the disease is widely prevalent, a common procedure in the use of the vaccine is inadvisable. For example, Henderson [1929] found in Nigeria that the local strain of virus was not safe until the 177th generation culture. Stewart [1935] observed that cattle of the Gold Coast the second generation of the Sudan culture virus was safe, whereas the 67th generation had no immunizing value. The development of immunity produced by this method is slow. Purchase [1939] found that with relatively large suitably-spaced double doses of 11th202 Bovine Pleuropneumonix TABLE I Vaccination with Assam, Australian and African Culture Vaccines and immunity tests, 1941 Vaccination Immunity tests Fate of control Vaccine 2.0 c.c. s/c Animal No. 1st vaccination 2nd vaccination Date Virus Results Assam 20th generation .

KRISHNA IYER 203 Test animals of each batch were given subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder a flat dose of 2 c.c. of the respective vaccine and the majority reinforced with the original vaccine, stored at 5ºC. between the intervals of vaccination which varied from one to three months. Animals were tested at varying intervals after vaccination and the results are given in Table I. The test that we have employed has given clear-cut results. Thus, when an animal has been successfully immunized it can withstand a very considerable dose of fully virulent virus. Further, failures in immunity tests are decisive, and partial or incomplete immunity indicated, we consider, by arrest and healing of the local lesion. In the Assam batch, vaccination was reactionless, except in one animal which died of pleuropneumonia eight days after the reinforcing dose or 76 days after the first vaccina- tion; signs of disease were seen in this case 64 days after the first vaccination. Of three animals tested for immunity with the homologous virus, one animal alone proved immune; the interval between initial vaccination and test was 278 days. In two animals which succumbed to the test dose this interval was 84 and 92 days respectively. Both these animals showed an acute generalization of disease indicating a complete absence of immunity. Of the two animals of this batch tested with Australian 264 lymph virus, one showed no evidence of immunity, whilst the other was partially immune, but it is to be noted that the two controls used in this test, one for each animal under test, reacted in the same way. In the second batch of cattle vaccinated with Australian 264 culture vaccine and tested with homologous virulent virus, one animal tested 288 days after the first vaccination reacted severely and died with acute generalization of the disease. One animal tested at 258 days survived a severe reaction. The control to each animal tested re- acted fatally. It will be noted that, of the three animals vaccinated with the 63rd generation Australian 264 culture, two reacted fatally, thus proving this generation unsafe in the cattle used, yet, ten generations later, this culture seemed to have little protective capacity against the homologous virus. Three animals of the same batch tested with Assam lymph virus at 187, 164 and 164 days were proved immune, the controls reacting fatally. Thus, it appears that the 73rd generation Australian culture protects feebly against Australian 264 virus, but adequately against the Assam virus. It is equally possible, on these results, that the Australian 264 virus is more potent than the Assam virus. It may also be noted that the interval elapsing between initial vaccination and test of animals with the Assam virus was considerably shorter than in animals tested with Australian 264 virus. In immunity tests of all animals of this batch, however, the interval between vaccina- tion and test was sufficient to ensure a maximum development of immunity. It is stated by Bennett [1932] and other workers that as good an immunity can be established with one dose of properly selected culture vaccine as with two suitably spaced doses, and this principle was followed in the vaccination of the third batch of cattle with 72nd generation Australian 173 culture vaccine. Two animals tested with virulent Assam lymph virus 189 and 305 days after vaccination were immune while the controls reacted fatally. However, a mild but definite reaction to the test dose was seen in the 2nd animal which would appear to indicate, that the 72nd generation of the Australian 173 culture vaccine was not so fully protective against the Assam virus as the 73rd generation of the Australian 264 culture vaccine; the reaction to immunity test of the 1st animal of the batch also indicates that the 72nd generation of the Australian 173 culture vaccine protects very little against Australian 264 lymph virus. In animals vaccinated with the Kenya strains, protection is afforded against the Assam virus, and feebly against the Australian 264 virus, which seems further to indicate that the Assam virus is weaker than the Australian 264. The results in the last batch of animals vaccinated with the Rhodesian R strain culture vaccine indicate that the immunizing value is poor or, alternatively, that there is little immunological relationship between this strain and the Assam. This point could only be settled by the reverse test, i.e. vaccination with the Assam strain and testing with Rhodesian R virus which was not, of course, available. The same remark applies to all tests of the Kenya culture vaccines. Although the number of animals used in the tests was necessarily limited, the presumptive evidence is that the Assam virus is immunologically related to the Australian and Kenya strains and doubtfully to the Rhodesian strain. Although the results in general indicate that the Australian 264 virus is a stronger virus than the Assam, it is equally possible that a quantitative
204 Bovine Pleuropneumonia but not qualitative, immunological variation exists. To determine this point, cross immunity tests in cattle immunized with greater certainty against both strains would be necessary and the next test is so framed. Vaccination of cattle by 'tail-tip' method with Australian 264 and Assam culture vaccines and cross immunity test. Four cattle were vaccinated tail tip with 0.5 c.c. 7th generation Assam culture and reinforced tail-tip twenty-six days later with 1 c.c. 8th generation of the same culture. The vaccina- tion was reactionless. One month after the second vaccination these animals were tested with 5 c.c. virulent Australian 264 virus, and no reaction ensured, whilst one control to the test reacted fatally. Similarly, four cattle were vaccinated with 7th and 8th generation Australian 264 culture. On test with 5 c.c. virulent Assam virus one month after the reinforcing dose, two cattle reacted as severely as the control to the test. Evidence of immunity in the other two animals was slight, both showing a severe reaction with eventual recovery. The results indicate that cattle fully immunized against the Assam virus are solidly immune to the Australian 264 virus and that cattle immunized with Australian 264 vaccine acquire only a feeble immunity against the Assam virus. This seems to contradict the previous results with attenuated culture vaccine, in which it appeared that Australian 264 culture vaccine adequately protects against the Assam virus. This discrepancy in results cannot be explained, but we attach more importance to the results of the latter test and consider it probable that a more substantial immunity is conferred by a highly virulent culture than by a definitely attenuated culture. Whatever be the explanation, the result of the test indicates some doubt in the immunological relationship of Australian 264 and Assam viruses. THE SEROLOGICAL REACTION OF HILL CATTLE VACCINATED WITH AFRICAN, AUSTRALIAN AND ASSAM VIRUSES-AGGLUTINATION TEST The limited number of tests performed was intended to give some idea of the serological rela- tionship of the strains of viruses under study and the correlation on the basis of immunity tests. Some divergence of opinion exists on the uniform presence of agglutinins in the sera of animals ex- posed either to natural or artificial infection, and opinion is divided on the question whether the agglutination test is of practical value in the detection of infected animals or as an indication of the degree of immunity following vaccination. Walker [1922] found that the percentage of error in the test was considerable. Heslop [1920] and Kearney [1923] believed the test to be of real practical value. Dahmen [1924] was doubtful of its value and favoured a combined agglutination-precipitin test. In the experience of Nakamura, Futamuru and Watenuki [1926] 46 per cent of the sera from known positive cases of the disease gave negative results, and conversely, 30 per cent of healthy sera were positive to the test. Ito, Yamagive and Itabeshi [1930] concluded that the test does not give as clear-cut results as seen in many bacterial infections, the maximum titres being around 1/80 with positive results not ex- ceptional in healthy animals. Daubney [1935] found serological tests unsatisfactory in detecting carriers in animals exposed to infection. In a critical analysis of the test, Campbell [1938] considers that results depend on the antigen used, and claims good results for a 0.2 per cent formalinised antigen adjusted to a No. 2 Brown opacity tube. In our tests, two types of antigen have been used. The first was a 0.5 per cent carbol saline suspension of a ten-day serum broth culture centrifuged at 12,000 revolutions for 40 minutes. The collected deposit of each run was adjusted to a No. 2 Brown opacity tube, one litre of culture yielding about 20 c.c. antigen. The second antigen used was prepared according to the formula of Campbell [1938]. With carbolized antigen prepared from Assam and Australian 264 cultures, the sera of cattle vaccinated against Assam, Australian and African viruses (Table I ) were tested with, in addition, the serum of an animal that had survived the intravenous inoculation of virulent Assam lymph virus and later proved immune (animal 12, Table II). In this batch, the test was carried out one month after the first vaccination and the results are given in Table II. Readings were made after 2 hours at 55ºC. and again after the tubes had stood at 37º.5 C. for 24 and 48 hours. Agglutination was usually indefinite at two hours and complete at the 24th hour with no variation in titre at the 48th hour. The results of the second test, using formalinised antigen, are given in
J. F. SHIRLAW AND P. R. KRISHNA IYER 205 Table III. The sera were tested 12 and 30 days after vaccination. It will be seen that the results with carbolized antigen were, on the whole, more critical than those with formalinised antigen. Further, Australian strains 264 and 173, Assam and Kenya Narok show some serological affinity not shared by Kenya V4 and ML strains. The serological reactions in animals 4 and 8 in Table II are contradictory and cannot be explained; both these animals showed an equal immunity on test. The results conform in general with experience recorded by Daubney, Dahmen, Walker, and Ito and his colleagues.

In India, where the cost of cattle is low, there can be no objection to the destruction of a few clinical cases when the disease is suspected in a herd or in an area; lesions to be taken as strongly suspicious include a tendency for pneumonia to be un- ilateral, marked pleurisy with a rapidly clotting exudate and marbling of the pneumonic areas with variegation of the affected lobules. In all fresh centres, the diagnosis should be clinched by sub- cutaneous inoculation of exudate or lung mash in two, six to twelve-month old cattle. The resultant syndrome and lesions are fully diagnostic, a fact of great importance in the field where laboratory facilities do not exist. Fortunately, in Assam, which in our present knowledge is the only area in India affected, the disease runs a rapid course and is always fatal. It is not necessary, therefore, at this juncture, to evolve a method of tracking down carrier animals, without which ordinarily progress in the control of the disease is hardly possible. If the position changes, serological means of diagnosis will have to be considered, but it is evident that no great reliance can be placed on the agglutination test. It is felt, however, that a more positive and direct approach to diagnosis, at least, in acute or recent cases, can often be achieved by tapping the chest and submitting the exudate so obtained to biological and cultural test; this should be a first step and, at the same time, the pos- sibility of obtaining positive cultures from the blood should not be forgotten. A survey of the literature indicates that general agreement has not been reached on the problem of immunity. The criterion of success must depend on field results assessed over a sufficiently long period, and these are not yet available. The use of attenuated culture vaccine is fairly general in Africa and Australia, but infrequent references in official reports leave an impression that this method has not, as anticipated, brought the disease under control; rigorous quarantine and control of cattle movement seem still as necessary as ever in affected territories. The report of the Tanganyika Terri- tory Veterinary administration [1937] states that no efficient or feasible policy for the eradication of the disease has yet been formulated. Is it possible that existing methods of vaccination, parti- cularly with attenuated culture vaccine, are not wholly satisfactory ? There are pointers in this direction. For example, of six cattle vaccinated with 16th generation Assam culture, two reacted severely and died whilst the remainder were solidly immune to a relatively large dose of lymph virus given subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder. Using a somewhat further attenuated Assam culture, i.e. 20th generation, none of six cattle vaccinated showed any reaction, obviously because of a greater attenuation of the culture, and on a subsequent immunity test none had the same level of immunity. The inference seems that some loss of immunizing power follows attenua- tion of the culture, even within narrow limits, and it would appear that, within the limits of safety, it is desirable to use a potent culture if a strong degree of immunity is to be established. In the experience of most workers, the experimental work on immunity has not been capable of exact analysis, on account of the difficulty in deciding on the type of immunity test that should be employed. It is generally stated that the subcutaneous inoculation of lymph virus is too drastic a test. The results recorded in this paper plainly show that, if an animal has been successfully immunized, it can certainly withstand this test. On this criterion, the degree and durability of immunity con- ferred by the 20th generation Assam culture is relatively slight compared with that following tail- tip vaccination with a 5th-8th generation culture which inevitably provokes a fatal reaction if ino- culated subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder in the same cattle. The same remarks apply to the use of lymph virus somewhat attenuated by storage at +5ºC. It appears from the results recorded that either of these methods can be expected to give reliable results in the field, and each has the advantage of only one vaccination being necessary. Little evidence is as yet available in India to assess the value of vaccination on these lines, but of approximately 200 cattle vaccinated tail-tip with virulent 8th generation Assam culture in one of the worst affected areas in Assam, none had contracted the disease 19 months later. Adapting the original Willem's technique of vac- cination to a fully virulent culture seems a dicided improvement in vaccination technique. It is quite clear from the literature that the original technique, using fresh virulent lymph, is unsafe, although productive of a high order of immunity. It has not been therefore, generally employed,
J. F. SHIRSAW AND P. R. KRISHNA IYER 207 save in continental countries where the losses incurred by the method are presumably justified by the results as a whole. The modification of the method is free from any objection, so much so that it has been reported from Assam that cattle so vaccinated are in no way incapacitated from full work, which is a very pertinent consideration in India. If vaccination camps staffed by competent men can be provided, and cattle owners be persuaded to bring their cattle for vaccination, the method is one that could immediately be put in operation. Otherwise, any method of vaccination that entails the use of a fragile culture vaccine is inoperable. It is conceivable that this difficulty could be overcome by the use of lymph virus attenuated by storage at 5ºC. One virus producer will yield sufficient vaccine to immunize over 1,000 head of cattle at a trifling cost, and the upkeep of labora- tories and trained personnel, which would be necessary if the first method were generally adopted, could be dispensed with. Lastly, very little attention has been paid by workers to the possibility of an antitoxic immunity. Nocard [1898] observed that, when the organism of pleuropneumonia was grown in collodion sacs placed in the abdominal cavity of rabbits, these animals usually became cachectic and died. Since no lesions were present at autopsy, and the organism could not be isolated from any of the tissues, this worker concluded that the phenomenon was due to the diffusion of toxins through the collodion membrane. At the same time, he commented on the fact that the rabbit is quite refractory to infection with virulent cultures of the organism. Sabin [1938] states, in refer- ence to the foregoing observation, 'in keeping with this is the observation that cattle may die after subcutaneous injection of infected lymph or culture, although the only lesion is at the site of inocu- lation ' and comments on the fact that the possible production of an exotoxin by the bovine pleuro- pneumonia organism is a neglected field of study, especially since it has been lately shown that at least one other member of the genus produces a true toxin in vivo and in vitro. Curasson [1936] comments that the problem has never been really studied, and quots the work of Arloing [1888], who claimed to have isolated, from lymph virus, a relatively thermostable toxin with a specific effect on bovine tissues. Certainly, no work has been done, in our knowledge, on the feasibility of an antitoxic immunity. In one experiment recorded in this paper, three cattle were subcutaneously inoculated with a Berkefeld N filtrate of virulent lymph, no reaction ensuing. Twenty-four days later, these animals were put to a standard immunity test and none proved immune. The experi- ment was repeated in two cattle, but in this case the immunity test was delayed for 112 days, both animals proving solidly immune. In this experiment there are three factors to consider, (a) the pleuropneumonia organism does not, in our experience, pass a Berkefeld N filter, (b) further proof of this is the negative reaction in cattle subcutaneously inoculated with such filtrates (c) immunity develops slowly, the time lag being apparently parallel with the virulence of the vaccine used [Pur- chase, 1939]. It is possible that an antitoxic immunity was established in animals used in the second test and the evidence so obtained indicates that a full investigation into this aspect of the problem of immunity might be well repaid. SUMMARY 1. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia exists in the province of Assam. 2. The two strains of virus that have been studied show an immunological relationship with each other and with strains received from Australia and Kenya. 3. The Assam virus when inoculated subcutaneously at the point of the shoulder in Kumaoni cattle causes 90 per cent mortality, specific lesions, hitherto undescribed, in the spleen and the abo- masum, and, in some cases, pleuropneumonia. 4. The Indian buffalo seems insusceptible to the disease in the field and of two buffaloes sub- cutaneously inoculated with fully virulent virus, one reacted and recovered. The goat is slightly susceptible to subcutaneous inoculation with the virus and sheep refractory and small laboratory animals resistant. 5. The virus uniformly passes a Berkefeld V but not a Berkefeld N filter. It will also pass L3 and L5 but not L7; occasionally it passes a Seitz E. K. filter. 6. Immunity experiments with formalinised virus vaccine gave negative results. In two im- munity experiments with a muscle powder vaccine attenuated by exposure to 70ºC, for 2 hours or C
208 Studies on Pleuropneumonia 55ºC. for 2 days, the first test indicated that a strong immunity was conferred by the vaccine. These results were not repeated in a second test, although the conditions of this test were somewhat different from the first. A modification of Willem's tail tip vaccination, using slightly attenuated cultures, produces a high grade immunity superior to that produced by cultures attenuated so as to be safe on subcutaneous inoculation. An equally good immunity can be produced by subcutaneous ino- culation of lymph virus refrigerated at 5°C. for just over three months. 7. The direct agglutination test did not give clear-cut reactions in assessing immunity or in serological identification of strains. 8. The morphological and cultural characters of the organism isolated from cases of bovine pleuropneumonia in Assam are described.

Bact. 36, 196 A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON VACCINATION AGAINST BOVINE CONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA IN ASSAM* By V. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN, Veterinary Investigation Officer, Assam (Received for publication on 10th April 1946) IN a previous article [Gopalakrishnan, 1943] an account was given of the occurrence of bovine contagious pleuropneumonia in Assam, as a specific epizootic with a tendency to spread in a slow and insidious manner. The high rate of mortality, ranking almost next to that of rinderpest, was recorded and the necessity for taking effective control measures was emphasized. The im- portance of vaccination in the control of the disease was also indicated. In the present paper an attempt is made to give the details of the preliminary field trials with contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine prepared at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. The product used was a culture-virus-vaccine tested by tail tip inoculation (Willem's method). EXPERIMENTAL VACCINATION Arrangement was made to stage a field test of pleuropneumonia vaccine at Gauhati. Five local indigenous cattle210 Against Bovine Pleuropneumonia Vaccination Out of the five vaccinated cattle, one bullock died of distomatosis and anaemia in July 1943 and a cow strayed away in May 1944 and could not be traced. The remaining three animals and a healthy bull as control, were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 c.c. of pneumonic lung emulsion and pleuritic effusion on the 24th November 1944. Reaction The vaccinated animals showed slight local swelling. It was hard, slightly painful and localized. It remained almost the same size for about a week and then gradually disappeared. In one animal the local swelling was slightly bigger than those of the other two and also subsided a few days later. There was no thermal reaction and the animals appeared normal and healthy during the observed period of three months. The reaction in the control bull was typical and similar to those previously observed in the transmission experiments. The animal appeared dull on the 8th day and the local swelling began to extend from the seat of inoculation to the region of the left shoulder. There was rise of tempe- rature up to 105.2ºF. (10th day) and later it was a degree or two more than the normal. At first, the swelling at the seat of inoculation was hot, painful and oedematous. Then, it increased in size, progressively extending further and involving the neighbouring tissues. There was no indication of abscess formation. The swelling extended to more than half way in the region of the neck, down to the dew-lap and to the sternal region, presenting a contiguous extensive swelling. Appetite was impaired and the bull was very dull with staring coat. The general condition was poor. During the early stage it was lame and subsequently it limped on three legs and finally assumed recumbent position for about three days before it died on the 19th December 1944 (25th day). Post-mortem lesions at the seat of inoculation were extensive. The cut surface was reddish- yellow in colour, firm and hard in consistency. There was oedema with pronounced serous infiltra- tion of the subcutaneous and intramuscular connective tissues. The prescapular lymph gland was enlarged and oedematous. There was nothing note-worthy in the lungs. DISCUSSION Cattle vaccinated on the 12th January 1943 were tested for immunity on the 24th November 1944 with a fresh and virulent strain obtained from a seat of outbreak of bovine contagious pleuro- pneumonia. The control bull reacted typically and died, manifesting specific lesions. Out of the three vaccinated cattle, one showed slight reaction or rather more local reaction than the other two, and all the three survived. Although the number of animals tested is small for drawing definite conclusions, yet there seems to be evidence that the duration of immunity is nearabout 22 months. The fresh material used for the immunity test, was also sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, from which the virus was obtained. In this connection, it is interesting to refer to the work in Australia. A different technique has been developed and is now employed for experimentally reproducing the typical pulmonary disease in cattle as well as for testing the value of immunization procedures (private communication dated the 4th December 1944 from Dr A. W. Turner). Campbell [1938] has reported that the disease produced experimentally in cattle, by the atomization technique, is in all respects identical with the naturally occurring disease. The exposure of animals to finely atomized culture is also used as a method of testing cattle for resistance produced following vaccination. The results of experimental tests by this method are reported to indicate that immunity is maintained for more than twelve months. Further, he suggested that animals vaccinated with a strain of the organism, possessing a relatively high degree of virulence, maintain a high and lasting immunity. In case of comparatively avirulent strain, the immunity is said to wane after two months. In regard to single and double vaccinated cattle, there appears to be no significant difference in the immunity set up when exposed at an interval of twelve months after vaccination. SUMMARY Details are given of the experimental vaccination carried out in two localitiesV. R. GOPALAKRISHNAN 211 A preliminary, small-scale experimental test of the vaccinated cattle, undertaken to determine the degree and duration of immunity by using fresh field strain of the virus for the test, is described. There is evidence of sufficient degree of immunity, the duration of which appears to be about 22 months. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to Mr J. F.

As the does used were in differing lactations, this would have necessarily involved bringing their respective milk yields either to first lactation basis [as done by Sukhthme, 1944] or mature age basis, as is usually done. Either of the courses was not possible, as no standard correction factors for the order of lactation are available for this breed ; nor was it possible to work them out from the data, as these were too meagre for that purpose. In the circumstances, the only course open to us was to pool the results of the five years and carry out the analysis of the combined data by comparing the like lactations of the two groups. Even so, it was observed that the records after the 5th lactation, were too few to carry out any useful analysis. They had therefore to be omitted. In passing, it may be mentioned that the method of analysis actually decided upon by us involve certain assumptions on our part. They were, (i) That no significant departure in husbandry took place during the five years of experi- mentation. (ii) That the average effect on the experimental animals due to environmental causes, from year to year, was uniform and negligible. It appears to us that assumption (i) is a reasonable one to make, as in fact, no significant depar- ture in husbandry took place on the farm during the course of the experimental work. The same, however, cannot be said about assumption (ii) as was brought out in the analysis. To the extent to which the assumption was not valid, the sensitiveness of the statistical test employed, has been minimised. A preliminary comparison of the two groups gave the following differences (Experimental Control): (i) For lactation yields214 Weaned Versus Unweaned (ii) For lactation lengthsS. S. PRABHU AND V. N. AMBLE 215 TABLE II216 Weaned Versus Unweaned TABLE IIS. S. PRABHU AND V. N. AMBLE 217 The differences now obtained were tested for significance, by carrying out the analysis of residual variance for each lactation (Table II C). The analysis showed that the milk yield differences in all the five lactations compared, were in no case statistically significant. The original significant differ- ence observed in comparisons of first, third and fourth lactations can thus be clearly attributed to the differences in lactation lengths of the lactations compared. The refinement in the test of signi- ficance brought about by the employment of the method of analysis of co-variance is well shown in the drop in the standard error of the average milk-yields.

These could only be the environmental and genetic variation effects, which could not be controlled due to the faulty layout of the design. As the error due to these causes, is seen to be considerable to that extent the sensitiveness of the statistical test employed has been reduced. (II) Effect of weaning on the male and female kids Year-wise enumeration of the kids employed for the study, during the entire experimental period of five years, is given in Table III. In all, a total of 128 kids were used ; 67 in Group A (32 males ; 35 females) and 61 in Group B (30 males ; 31 females). In computing the above figures, as also in the analysis, no account was taken of kids whose monthly live weight data were not available for a full year. Average weights and growth rates were obtained by fitting straight lines to the 12 monthly live weight observations. Inter-group comparisons were first made separately for the yearly data with the two sexes taken separately. Such an analysis was possible as sufficient ob- servations were available for the two groups and the two sexes within a given year. In this way, the year to year variation and sex to sex variation, were largely eliminated. As the results obtained were consistent for all the five years, only the pooled averages are given in Table IV.

AMBLE 221 The test has clearly brought out that initial weights significantly influence both the average weights and average growth rates of kids of both sexes in the two groups. The corrected average weights and average growth rates of the kids in the two groups work out as follows : Male kids Female kids Group A Group B Difference Group A Group B Difference Corrected average weights in lb. 29.06 27.63 + 1.43 26.06 26.73 222 Weaned Versus Unweaned such a basis would under-estimate the actual yields. No doubt this method would be to the dis- advantage of the dams in Group B. Even than, statistical analysis shows, that the average difference in lactation yields, after correcting for the length of the wet period, between the weaned and un- weaned groups of animals, is not significant. This finding has to be read in conjunction with what is said at (b) above. Though no definite conclusions are justifiable, it would appear that probably the animals get used to the treatment after some time and hence no appreciable difference is introduced through the 'holding back' of the milk by the dams. Secondly, in any case the part played by suckling would not be large after the fourth month when the kids in Group B too were weaned. The average length of lactation of the does in Group B was 220 days which means that the effect of suckling would be felt only during the first 120 days of the total 220 days. As regards item v does whose kids were weaned at birth, appear to give on an average (at any rate in case of does in I, III and IV lactations) larger yields of milk than the does whose kids were not so weaned. The lactation lengths also were greater. Statistical tests showed that the increased yields were due to increased lengths of lactations. With the information at our disposal, it is difficult to say, whether the enhanced wet period is a direct consequence of weaning. On an average, there was an increase of 56 days in the wet period. The average increase in milk yield was 126 lb. i.e., about 2 lb. increase per day increase in wet period. Actually, this figure would be very much less. An adult doe in milk would take 1 lb. of concentrates and 4 lb. of fodder. Ignoring the housing and labour charges the cost of producing 2 lb. of milk works out (at the present rates) to about 3 to 4 annas, which appears to be advantageous to the villager, when we consider the price and quality (especially the latter) of the milk sold in the market. Against this advantage has to be set the cor- responding delay in getting the new kid, and also the delay in proving of sires. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We are indebted to Dr P. V. Sukhatme for the keen interest he has shown in the progress of this investigation and for helpful criticism. REFERENCES Bhatia, S. S. (1942). Weaning at birth and Hand-feeding of kids. Ind.

A NOTE OF CLINICAL ASPECTS OF ' KHERWAN DISEASE ' By P. N. NANDA, M.R.C.V.S., and H. K. LALL, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Government Cattle Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 8th April 1946.) (With Plate X and two text-figures) THIS disease first occurred in 1940 in the form of an outbreak causing heavy mortality at the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar at Kherwan block and was named after the place of its occurrence. In the year 1941 and 1942 there were negligible number of deaths caused by this disease. In the year 1944 another outbreak occurred in which the mortality figures exceeded the peak reached in 1940. The disease remained confined to Thaska and Chaoni blocks of the farm while a few cases occurred at Salli and the Home farm. (For the situation of the places mentioned in the text, see the Plate X, fig. 1). The other two blocks of the farm, namely the Stables and the Kherwan, remained absolutely free. Seasonal incidence. The disease has a seasonal incidence ; each year it has started in the months of December or January and persisted upto or the middle of May, the peak having reached in the last week of March and the first week of April. It was observed that in the year 1940 and 1944 the maximum and minimum temperatures during these months were low as compared with those in the years 1941, 1942 and 1943 and the rainfall was higher during the months of January, February and March, the months during which the maximum number of cases were recorded (see Table I and Figs. 1 and 2).

Average rainfall and mean temperature during the Outbreak years' The rainfall was badly distributed in years 1939 and 1943 thus there was a very negligible amount of grazing left at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year and it is possible that it may have had an important bearing on the occurrence of the disease. The present (1944) outbreak, similar to previous ones, was expected to subside by the end of March but the unusual rains in that month made the weather cool and it continued for a longer period. Method of spread. The disease seemed to spread rather abruptly from one yard of the block to another yard and from one block to another block in a sporadic mannerP. N. NANDA AND H. K.

Some of the animals showed oedema of the sub-maxi- llary space but it seemed to bear no relation to the stage of the disease in which the animal was, because some animals had almost recovered and had this oedema just the same. Lesions. The cattle were emaciated and some had lost hair round the flanks. What fat there was seemed to be degenerated (gelatinous or myxomatous degeneration). On opening the abdominal cavity oedematous fluid came out, its quantity varying from a few ounces to a gallon, though there was none in some cases. There were no lesions on the tongue, pharynx or oesophagous. Only in one case were there some punched out ulcers in the pharyngeal region and on the mucous membrane of the oeso- phagous. The rumen, reticulum and omasum did not show any lesions usually ; however, in one case the rumen wall was very oedematous and thickened and showed an extensive haemorrhage on its outer surface. The most characteristic lesions were present in the fourth stomach (Plate X, fig. 2). In about 50 per cent of the cases there were some petechial haemorrhages in between and on the edges of the folds. In some instances, however, when there was no oedema, there was very severe con- gestion of abomasum with ulcers : such cases were few. On the whole of the inner surface of the small intestine minute haemorrhages had occurred or the mucous membrane was so much congested as to suggest a very severe enteritis. This congestion was patchy in the caecum giving the appearance of zebra markings. By passing a finger over the surface of the intestines a whitish mucous would collect on the edges of the finger. In some cases the whitish fluid was found in the intestine with small particles of fibrin in it. The rectum was also congested in some. In one instance the rectum was prolapsed to a minor degree. The tissues in the perineal region were also oedematous as were the mesenteric lymph glands. In some cases there was slight peritonitis as well. The liver was appa- rently normal, but on cutting into it, it bled easily ; the bile was very thick, dark and inspissated and the gall bladder considerably distended in most of the cases. Whitish granular spots, not of parasitic origin, were visible in the parenchyma of the pancreas. The kidneys were normal, apart from showing congestion in some cases. The spleen was crenated but otherwise normal, and the bladder was found dilated in some cases while contracted in others. Some haemorrhagic areas were found in the lungs which bled easily on pressure in some cases. The quantity of the fluid in the pericardial cavity was excessive and the fat round the coronary art- eries was almost absent. Haemorrhages were found in a few cases on the myocardium and endo- cardium. The brain was congested and haemorrhages were to be seen in quite a number of cases, the piameter covering the frontal lobes of the brain and the base of the brain was almost black. But in quite a number of brains from animals that died due to other diseases blackishness of the piameter was observed. The spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid were normal macroscopically. During the outbreak some other animals (more aged) which died from traumatic pericarditis and generalized tuberculosis showed ulcers in the fourth stomach and the congestion of the brain and the blackish piameter as seen in the Kherwan disease. It is possible that either the two condi- tions co-existed or the older animals had got over the disease thus leaving only some scars of the disease in their organs. Etiology. The histopathology was studied at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, and transmission experiments were also carried there as well as at Hissar. The results of the experiments at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute and the study of its histopathology will probably form a separate paper to be published at a later date. A brief report on the histopathology of the disease received from G. D. I. Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, is included here for the sake of completeness. 'The most important lesions are centred in the brain and spinal cord ; these consist in intense congestion and occasional haemorrhage of capillaries throughout the brain and cord with some de- position of blood pigment ; some degree of perivascular infiltration and necrosis and neuronophagia of nerve cells.' In one case the meninges (piameter) of the spinal cord showed considerable oedema
228 Clinical Aspects of Kherwan Disease with proliferation of fixed connective tissue elements, and acute congestion of capillaries with purely monocytic infiltration, i.e., leptomeningitis. 'The mucous coat of the gastro-ontestinal tract was normal in cases examined, although capi- llaries in sub-mucous coat were highly injected and in one case there was considerable sub-mucous oedema with loosening and necrosis of the overlying mucous coat.' Efforts were made to transmit the disease by (i) subcutaneous injection of blood from the diseased animals in the acute stages to healthy ones ; (ii) injecting subcutaneously an emulsion of intestines on fourth stomach ; (iii) drenching with the emulsion of intestines and fourth stomach ; (iv) intranasal insuffulation (v) Injection of brain emulsion into temporal fossa and anterior chamber of the eye. The disease could not be transmitted. As all the animals in which the disease appeared particularly in 1944 outbreak were thin, it was thought that it might be due to some nutritional cause. A very significant fact which has been mentioned before has to be repeated here, i.e., the grazing was very poor in 1940 as well as in 1944 and due to this the animals had to be fed solely on ensilage and Kurbi jowar of the crop of the previous year and the one before that. Some of this had become mouldy. Samples of the feed were sent to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute for analysis, etc., but no conculsions could be derived. Vitamin A and serum calcium were also determined in the last outbreak and were found to be normal but the vitamin A content of some of the livers sent during 1944 was subnormal. 'It may also be mentioned here parenthetically that there were 48 deaths in 1945 and that 20 (16 per cent) calves out of these were weaned between 3 to 4 months as they were from tuberculous mothers and were thus weaker than those weaned normally at 9 months of age.' When the disease appeared the quantity of the green feed given to all the animals was increased but it did not seem to alter the course of the disease to any great extent. Whether it was the accumulative effect of the absence of certain food substances which reduced the absorption of food is not certain. The ration fed to the animals at Chaoni and Thaska for the four months during which disease occurred is tabulated in Appendix II. With a view to determining the effect of prolonged feeding of Kurbi jowar and its ensilage, four animals were purchased from villages and were fed on Kurbi jowar and ensilage only. One animal was destroyed after 3½ months, but it did not show any typical lesions of Kherwan disease. One which died eight months afterwards showed some doubtful lesions only. Serum protein estimation in 10 animals was made but no definite conclusions could be drawn from the results obtained. Only some of the animals which were being fed on green fodder and grains died, but, none of the prime young bulls being fed on a special grain ration was affected. Effect of magnesium sulphate drench. Some animals were given a drench consisting of magne- sium sulphate with a view to eliminate toxins from the intestines. It did not have any profound effect in the course of the disease. Out of eight animals which were given this treatment, three reco- vered and five died (see Table IV).

VISWANATHAN, G.M.V.C., Veterinary Investigation Officer (Madras) and S. VENKATRAMA AYYAR, G.M.V.C., Assistant to the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Madras (Received for publication on 2 April 1945) ANTHRAX is sporadic in Madras, occurring all over the province and at all times of the year in an acute form. In any one outbreak, it is rare for more than one or two animals to be affected. The onset is sudden and ends fatally without symptoms being seen. This paper concerns anthrax in bovines, especially in cattle belonging to the Corporation of Madras. In this outbreak many animals were affected and most of them suffered from a subacute form of the disease. Hutyra and Marek [1938] state that outbreaks of subacute cases of anthrax do occur. In Central Provinces, Bachan Singh [1938] recorded an outbreak of anthrax of subacute type, which occurred in Raipur. Viswanathan [1938 and 1942] recorded similar type of outbreaks in bovines at Villupuram Taluk of South Arcot, Madagasira Taluk of Anantapur, and in Tiruvellore Taluk of Chingleput. Thus in village M. thirteen animals were affected, of which five died and eight recovered ; in village S. thirty- three animals were affected, of which thirtytwo died and one recovered. These outbreaks also were confirmed as anthrax by examination of blood smears. HISTORY OF PRESENT OUTBREAK This occurred in epizootic form in June, 1944, reaching its maximum about the fourth week. Two animals were found dead on the morning of June 18. Blood smears were positive for anthrax. On the same day, anthrax serum was used at the rate of 15 c.c. for the healthy and 40 to 60 c.c., according to the size, for the ailing animals. Sixtyfour healthy and five ailing animals were treated. These animals were stationed at A. Depot of the Madras Corporation, which for the past two months had been used as a foot and mouth disease segregation camp. A and B Depot animals before they were segregated here were in the habit of going to the dumping ground, where street refuse and rubbish are deposited and where dead animals are usually buried. Of the five animals treated on June 18, two were found dead of anthrax two days later. On June 20, the other three animals were given intravenously 20 c.c. of antianthrax serum. On June 21, two animals were found dead of anthrax, one of them being a treated animal and the other a newly purchased one. Before the actual investigation began on June 21, six animals had died of anthrax, diagnosed by examination of blood smears. THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION On June 20, when the outbreak was first reported, it was decided to vaccinate with anthrax spore vaccine. During the previous years, six cases of anthrax had occurred in Corporation animals. During the month before the present outbreak, there had been an outbreak of foot and mouth disease and this appeared to be a predisposing cause, as many of the animals were weak and debi- litated and also had wounds between the digits. Moreover, as stated, these animals were in the habit of going to a dumping ground, where previous anthrax cases and other animals had been buried. Further due to careless handling and disposal of carcases, it is possible that the water tub and food stuffs may have been contaminated. It is also possible, that biting flies such as Tabanus may have transmitted the infection. On June 21, the temperature of all the animals in the Depot were taken before vaccination, in order to detect the ones in the incubation stage. Fifteen animals were then showing high tem- perature. Of these, 11 belonged to the B. Depot and 4 to the A. Depot. Period of incubation. According to Gaiger and Davis [1938] the period of incubation is 24 hours to 2 or 3 days or may even be as long as 14 days. From the details collected in this outbreak, five animals have shown a period of incubation of 12 hours, but this was probably not correct for the first two deaths, as they were not observed probably till the disease was confirmed as anthrax on 232
G. R. VISWANATHAN AND S.V. AYYAR 233 18-6-1944. Fourteen animals were ill for three days from the commencement of the outbreak ; seven animals showed symptoms after four days ; two animals began to show symptoms after five days, five animals after a lapse of six days and only one after seven days. Thus it will be seen that most affected animals showed symptoms after an incubation period of three to four days. Symptoms. These were similar to those seen in the out breaks recorded by the first author in 1938 and in 1940. One or two cases died suddenly in a peracute form without showing any symptoms, but in other cases there were definite symptoms. As a rule, in animals, which died suddenly or were found dead, symptoms were acute and took the form of a septicaemia, accompanied by a sudden apopletic attack resulting in death in a few minutes after the appearance of the first symptoms. In most subacute cases, the symptoms consisted of high fever, staring coat, dullness, loss of appetite, etc. The cattle fell down and died. In one or two instances there were swellings, in one case in the throat region extending to the dewlap ; in another in the neck extending downwards to the sternum. It may be remarked that in one cow, which died in village M. in the previous outbreak, swelling was noticed in the perineal region extending to the udder. All animals died, if no treatment was given. In a few cases blood was oozing out from the natural orifices. The duration of the disease was from one to four days. Out of the 24 animals that died 16 suffered from one to four days, 5 for twelve hours and less, 2 for five days and only one for six days. Thus in this outbreak, the period of illness ranged from a few hours to six days. Duration of the outbreak. The outbreak began on June 18, reached its climax on June 22 and the last death occurred on June 29. The outbreak thus lasted for 12 days. Control. The outbreak was controlled by (a) Disinfection and proper disposal of carcases. (b) Prophylactic vaccination of the healthy. (c) Treatment of affected. (a) Disinfection and proper disposal of carcases The usual hygienic and disinfectant measures were adopted. Every precaution was taken to avoid contamination of the stall feeding troughs, water tubs, fodder, grains, etc., from blood or other fluid excreta from dead animals ; carcases were destroyed by burning. Before the removal of car- cases, natural orifices were plugged and the whole carcase was covered with disinfectants and then removed in a cart for disposal. At first, the carcases were cremated, later they were buried at a depth of six feet with quicklime. The ground area, stalls, etc., were scraped with disinfectants and then sprinkled with powdered quicklime. Stalls occupied by the affected animals were thoroughly disinfected. All food and straw that had come in contact with affected animals or carcases or which was contaminated by their excrements or blood was burnt. The conservancy cart in which the car- cases were removed, and the manure, etc., were burnt. The whole Depot was thoroughly disinfected. (b) Prophylactic vaccination of healthy animals Since anthrax serum failed to protect, anthrax spore vaccination was adopted. This was done on 21 June, using vaccine prepared at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. The dose given was 1 c.c. subcutaneously on the left side of the neck. In all 51 bovines were treated. Re- actions were as follows. There was no local reaction except in three cases, where there was oedema extending to the dewlap. Most vaccinated animals showed no temperature reaction. When present the temperature reaction was usually noticed between the fourth and tenth day. Of the nine deaths among the vaccinated animals, five died before the vaccination reaction and of the remaining four, two were confirmed positive for anthrax and the other two were declared negative. They died of old age and debility. Thus only two deaths occurred among fifty-one vaccinated animals giving a mortality of 3.9 per cent. There were no deaths in the Depot after 29 June, i.e., nine days after vaccination the disease was controlled effectively. In this outbreak, where the cases were declared positive for anthrax, the premises were more or less isolated. All the healthy stock were vaccinated. (c) Treatment of affected with novarsenobillon Hutyra and Marek [1938] state that favourable results may be obtained by symptomatic treat- ment with camphor, ether, etc. Pande [1937] reported successful treatment of anthrax with camphor, F2
234 Subacute Anthrax in Cattle in Madras if it is administered during the early stage of the disease. He advises the use of one dram of camphor in 20 c.c. of olive oil subcutaneously and orally with treacle administered every three hours. In view of some encouraging results obtained previously in Madras with novarsenobillon (May and Baker), this drug was used in the present outbreak both for affected animals among the non- vaccinated and also for animals showing temperature from the second day after vaccination. Of the 15 affected non-vaccinated animals treated, 9 died. Among the vaccinated animals 15 were treated and of these 7 died and 8 recovered. Thus out of 30 animals treated, 16 died and 14 recovered, indicating that novarsenobillon has some value. Before the investigation started, all the anthrax cases died. There were no natural recoveries in the outbreak of 1941. An initial dose of at least one gram of the drug is essential and it has a definite curative value when given intravenously in time. SUMMARY An account is given of an outbreak of subacute anthrax among cattle in Madras. The outbreak occurred in June among animals which had recently suffered from foot and mouth disease and it lasted for twelve days. The period of incubation appeared to be about three or four days, and an illness of one to four days was followed by death. Anthrax serum was found to be valueless for control, but anthrax spore vaccine brought the outbreak to an end and this in most animals caused no local or thermal reaction. Treatment of affected animals with novarsenobillon appeared to be effective when the drug was given in the early stages. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We wish to thank Mr T. J.

ANANTAKRISHNAN and M. C. RANGASWAMY, IMperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 5 November 1946) BUTTERFAT, being the most valuable constituent of milk, determines the quality of milk and numerous investigations have been made to study the various factors affecting its yield . Although there is a certain amount of disagreement among the findings of the various workers, the concensus of opinion is that fat percentage in milk is an inherited quality of the particular indi- vidual animal and the breed to which it belongs. In countries where large amounts of milk are utilized for the manufacture of butter, this has led to the selective breeding of certain strains of animals with higher fat percentage. Of the English breeds of cows, Jersey and Guernsey give higher fat percentage in milk than Freisian or Shorthorn. In India Scindhi and Gir cows give milk richer in butterfat as compared to many of the English breeds and the Indian buffalo is unrivaled in this respect among the dairy animals of the world, so much so that it has been called a veritable butter producing machine. This being the case there is no wonder if buffaloes are prefered in India where ghee is the most important dairy product. But even among animals of the same breed variation in the fat content of milk has been observed from time to time. This has led to many investigations into the causes of the fluctuation in the fat percentage of the milk and it has been found that factors like individuality, the interval between two successive milkings, time of milking, stage of lactation, season of the year, and the age of the animal are mainly responsible for the fluctuations in the fat percentage of the milk of the same animal at different periods or between the milks of different animals of the same breed. The influence of the feed consumed by the animal on the yield of milkfat was recognized only later, but now it is definitely known that the food consumed by the animal plays an important part in the yield of both milk and milkfat. The ordinary farmer knows the importance of the concentrate cattle feeds like oil cakes as food for dairy cattle. The albuminoids of the cakes primarily contribute to the increased production of milk. It is quite natural that the cakes might contain considerable amounts of oils but the function of these oils in the cattle feeds has not been fully realized. Numerous investigations have been made both in Europe and in America to study the effect of various oils on the yields of milk and butterfat. In the case of a supplementary ration of fat in addition to an already adequate ration, a peculiar situation is created whereby an additional amount of fat is made available to the mammary glands of the animal for conversion into milkfat. If this hypothesis is correct, one can naturally expect an increase in the fat content of milk when oils are fed to dairy animals. Depending upon the nature of the fat fed, the effect may be qualitative or quantitative or even both. It is more than clear that the analytical constants of ghee (butterfat) may be affected within a very short time by a supple- mentary feed of any fat to the animal. This is particularly important in view of the fact that butter and ghee are judged for purity by the analytical constants. India produces large amounts of a variety of edible oils and hydrogenation of these oils is also becoming very popular. In the near future, large amounts of hydrogenated oils may become avail- able at a cheap rate. If the untreated oil has some effect on the yield and composition of the butter- fat as reported by Moghul et al [1945], it is to be naturally expected that hydrogenated oils also should exert some influence on the yield and composition of butterfat. Owing to the change in the degree of unsaturation when an oil is hydrogenated, it is expected that the effect of vanaspati feeding would be different from that of the untreated oil. Again if the hydrogenated oils can be economically converted into the more nutritious butterfat through the medium of the dairy animal it will really be an achievement. But so far no systematic work has been done to study this aspect of the problem. Dustman et al [1941] observed that when one pound of hydrogenated soyabean oil was fed to cows, the iodine number increased slightly, showing a slight desaturation by the cow. Hilditch and Jasper- son [1943], supplemented the basal ration of dairy cows with groundnut oil, hydrogenated groundnut 235
236 Influence of Dietary Fat on yield and Composition of Butterfat oils of iodine values 45 and 17 respectively and peanut oil of iodine value 17. The untreated ground- nut oil of iodine value 85 increased the iodine value of the butterfat by 4.6 and lowered the R. M. and Polenske values by 6.6 and 0.6 respectively. Hydrogenated groundnut oil of iodine value 45 had more or less the same effect. But in the case of hydrogenated groundnut oil of iodine value 17, the change in composition was less marked, butterfat being almost of similar composition as the control butter. Palm-kernel oil of iodine value 17 lowered the iodine and R. M. values by 5 and 1.2 units respectively and increased the Polenske value slightly. In neither of the cases was there any signi- ficant increase in the milk yield or fat output. Moghul et al [1945] have reported that 1½ lb. of cotton- seed oil had a beneficial effect on the milk yield of Scindhi cows and sesame and coconut oils had more pronounced effect on the milk yield and fat output of Murrah buffaloes at the same time affect- ing the composition of the resulting butterfat considerably in all cases. But no work seems to have been done to study the effect of feeding hydrogenated oils on the milk yield and fat output of the indigenous breed of cattle. Therefore, a series of experiments was conducted to study the effect of feeding oils of two diffent degrees of saturation on the milk yield and butterfat output of Scindhi cows and Murrah buffaloes and the results obtained are presented in this paper. EXPERIMENTAL Nine Scindhi cows and nine Murrah buffaloes of almost the same age, body weight, stage of lactation and milk yield were selected for the experiment from the herd of the Imperial Dairy Research Institute. These were divided into three equal groups, one for control and the other two for experi- mental purposes. The control group received only the normal ration fed to the Institute herd through- out the period. The normal concentrate ration of the Institute herd consisted of a mixture of wheat bran, gram, gram husk and groundnut cake in the proportion of 4.0 : 1.5 : 2.0 : 2.5. This mixture was fed at the rate of one pound for every two pounds of milk yielded by the animal. The roughage consisted of 50 lb. of green grass (mixture of Guinea and Napier grasses) and 3 lb. of ragi straw in the case of cows and 70 lb. green grass and 3 lb. of ragi straw for buffaloes. Till the actual feeding of the vanaspati was started, all the animals, both control and experimental, were receiving only this ration. The milk yield and fat percentage were noted for all the animals for a week, at the end of which a day's yield of milk was separately collected from each animal for butter making. After this initial control period for all the animals, including the experimental ones, one group of cows and buffaloes was fed ½ lb. of hydrogenated coconut oil and the other group of cows and buffaloes ½ lb. groundnut oil vanaspati per head on the first day. This was increased to 1 lb. on the second day and thereafter 1½ lb. were fed per head per day for a fortnight besides the normal ration which the animals were already receiving. The control animals received only the normal ration all the time. The milk yield and the percentage of fat in milk were recorded systematically every day. Every 5th day a day's milk was separately collected from each animal for butter making and this butter was then melted into ghee at 115ºC. filtered and analysed for R. M., Polenske and Iodine Values and B. R. reading. The oil feeding was stopped after 15 days but the milk yield and fat percentage of milk were observed for another one week at the end of which again a day's milk was collected for butter making.

The milk yields of the experimental animals were reduced considerably during the vanaspathi feeding period but the yield of the control animals remained steady throughout with slight variation. The maximum fall in yield was by about 4 lb. per day in the average daily milk yield. When the vanaspathi feeding was stopped the milk yield showed a tendency to rise ; but even after a week the yield remained below the normal level. (2) Fat output. There was a marked decline in the fat percentage of the milk and combined with the fall in milk yield this resulted in a net decrease in the average daily fat output. The maxi- mum fall in fat percentage was 1.8 in one case. The milk yield and fat output are given in Table II.

There was a marked change in the chemical constants of the butterfat collected during the experimental period. There was a general decrease in R.

The iodine value increased by 9.4 units in one case and B. R. reading increased by 3.6. Within a week after stopping the vanaspathi feeding the values returned to normal. In the case of the control animals the analytical constants of the ghee remained fairly steady throughout the experimental period. The composition of the butterfat is given in Table III.

Feeding of groundnut vanaspathi to buffaloes decreased the R. M. and Polenske values, increased the Iodine value and very slightly increased the B. R. reading. The decrease in R. M. value was by 13.1 units in one particular case ; in another case the iodine value increased by 11.4 units, and Polenske value went down by 1.1 unit. In one case the B. R. reading increased by 3 units, other cases showing changes of 1.6 and 1.7 respectively. Even here the values showed a definite tendency to return to normal in the case of the experimental animals after the feeding was stopped and the control animals gave butterfat of uniform composition throughout the experi- mental period.

FEEDING OF COCONUT VANASPATHI TO MILCH ANIMALS A. Cows (1) Milk yield. Cows fed on a supplement of coconut vanaspathi recorded a fall in milk yield even within five days of the feeding. The maximum fall in milk yield at the end of a fortnight's coconut vanaspathi feeding was nearly 3 lb. in one case. Even after stopping the vanaspathi feeding the fall in milk yield continued for a week. The milk yield remained fairly steady in the case of the control animals. (2) Fat output. There was a slight increase in the fat percentage of the milk in the case of the experimental animals, the maximum being 0.6 per cent in one individual case, the increase in others being 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. In spite of this increase in the fat percentage of milk, the average daily fat output decreased due to the fall in the milk vield. The fat output of the control animals remained fairly steady as also the fat percentage of their milk. The average daily milk yield and fat output are given in Table VI. G

During the experimental period the analytical constants of the butterfat were changed considerably but not so much as in the case of groundnut vanaspathi. The maximum change observed in R. M. value was a fall of 7.0 units in one case ; iodine value, unlike in other cases, showed a decrease up to a maximum fall of 5.3 ; Polenske value increased sligthly in all cases and B. R. reading remained almost steady all the time except for a slight fall at the end. After the stopping of the vanaspathi feeding, the values showed a tendency to come back to the normal in a week's time. In the case of the control animals there was no considerable change in the analytical constants of ghee. The composition of the butterfat is presented in Table VII.

I. P. SINGH VERMA, T. M. PAUL, ETC. 241 B. Buffaloes (1) Milk yield. The milk yield was considerably increased even within 5 days of the feeding of the coconut vanaspathi to buffaloes, but later on the rate of increase was not kept up so much, so that after reaching the peak figure on the 5th day, the average daily milk yield began to fall. It remained well above the average daily milk yield at the end of the 15 days feeding period. The maximum increase recorded is a pound in the average daily milk yield. After the stopping of the feeding of the vanaspathi the yield returned to almost normal in a week's time. (2) Fat output. There was a small but definite increase in the fat percentage of milk during the vanaspathi feeding, the maximum increase observed being 14. Unlike the other cases here the milk yield also had increased resulting in a net increase in the average daily output of fat, the increase observed being 120 gm. per day in one particular case. Here again the fat percentage and daily fat output returned almost to normal a week after the stopping of the supplementary feeding of vanaspathi. In the case of the control animals the fat percentage of milk as well as the daily output of fat remained almost stationary. The average daily milk vield and fat output are given in Table VIII.

After stopping the supplemen- tary feed of the vanaspathi, the composition came back to very near the normal within a week and in the case of the control animals there was no considerable change in any of the analytical constants throughout the period under observation.

The animals did not show any reluctance to take 1½ lb. of the oil along with their concentrate ration. No digestive disturbance nor any laxative effect was observed during the experimental period. DISCUSSION Neither of the vanaspathi had any favourable action on the milk yield of cows, but on the con- trary, there was considerable depression in the milk yield in the case of cows which received a supple- mentary feed of groundnut vanaspathi. In the case of coconut vanaspathi too there was a decrease in the milk yield of the cows but it was less marked than in the groundnut vanaspathi group. Moghul et al [1945 unpublished] have reported that feeding of untreated oils like coconut, groundnut or sesame maintained the milk yield and cottonseed oil increased the milk yield of cows. Therefore the findings of the present investigation leads to the conclusion that hydrogenation lowers the quality of the oils as far as their suitability as feed for milch cattle is concerned. Probably this has to be attributed to the saturation and consequent rise in the melting point of vanaspathi. In the case of buffaloes, groundnut vanaspathi showed the same effect as in the case of cows, viz., a depression in the milk yield but it was not so marked as in the case of cows. The effect of the supplementary feed of coconut vanaspathi on buffaloes was, however, different from that on cows. Buffaloes recorded an increase in the average daily milk yield on being fed with coconut vanaspathi. The finding of the previous workers who fed untreated coconut oil is also the same with the difference that there was a slight depression in the yield in the beginning, which later on increased considerably even after stopping the feeding of the untreated oil. In the case of the hydrogenated coconut oil the increase is more pronounced in the first few days, and on stopping the feeding the yield comes almost to the normal in a week's time.
I. P. SINGH VERMA, T. M. PAUL, ETC. 243 With regard to the effect on the yield of butterfat also hydrogenated oils differ from the untreated oil. The findings of the present investigation are that groundnut vanaspathi lowers the fat percen- tage of the milk of cows considerably and coconut vanaspathi increases it slightly. This, along with a fall in the milk yield had led to a net decrease in the average daily output of fat, more pronounced in the case of cows fed on groundnut vanaspathi. In the case of buffaloes both vanaspathis have produced an increase in the fat percentage of the milk. Although there was a decline in the milk yield when groundnut vanaspathi was fed to buffaloes the increase in fat percentage has more than made up for that which resulted in a net increase in the average daily output of fat. In the case of coconut vanaspathi since there was no fall in milk yield the increase in the total daily fat output was more pronounced. Thus the buffalo is found to be more suitable for the conversion of the vanaspathi into butterfat. Even with the untreated oils buffaloes produced better results according to Moghul et al. [1945]. The composition of the butterfat was markedly changed during the experimental period when either of the vanaspathis was fed. All animals showed this change within five days of feeding the vanaspathi and gradually the composition of the butterfat returned to normal within a week after stopping the vanaspathi feeding. There was a decrease in R. M. and Polenske values and a rise in Iodine value and B. E. reading of the butterfat of cows which received a supplementary feed of ground- nut vanaspathi. In the case of coconut vanaspathi R. M. value decreased but to a less extent, Polenske value increased slightly and the Iodine value and B. R. readings decreased. This difference in the change in composition is perhaps to be attributed to the difference in the composition of the two different vanaspathis. Buffaloes which received vanaspathis as supplementary feed produced butter which differed very much in composition from the butter of the control period of the same buffaloes and from the butter of the control animals. As in cows, R. M. and Polenske values decreased, and iodine value and the B. R. reading showed a tendency to increase in the case of the butterfat of the buffaloes which were receiving a supplement of 1½ lb. of groundnut vanaspathi. Coconut vanaspathi differed from the groundnut vanaspathi in its effect on the composition of the butterfat, the R. M. value decreased just as in the case of groundnut vanaspathi but the Polenske value increased, and Iodine value decreased, and the B. R. reading remained almost steady. Only the buffaloes that received a supplementary ration of coconut vanaspathi recorded an increase in milk yield. Cows which received either of the vanaspathis and buffaloes that received groundnut vanaspathi all recorded a decrease in milk yield. Apart from the fall of milk yield of the cows during the vanaspathi the fat content of the milk also went down resulting in a considerable decrease in the output of fat. But buffaloes gave richer milk in both cases and consequently the fat output was increased slightly. Thus buffaloes seem to be more responsive to vanaspathi feeding. But further feeding trials extending over a longer period preferably one complete lactation will be necessary to study the long range effects of such supplementary feeding as also the economic aspect of the problem. Regarding the composition of the butterfat of animals receiving vanaspathi supplements, cows and buffaloes seem to react almost in the same way, but different vanaspathis produce different effects. The R. M. value is decreased in all cases, the decrease depending upon the E. M. value of the vanas- pathi fed. The Iodine value increased in the case of groundnut vanaspathi while it decreased in the case of coconut vanaspathi. Polenske value increased in the case of coconut vanaspathi while it decreased on feeding groundnut vanaspathi. All these indicate the possibility of altering the compo- sition of the butterfat by giving suitable feeds. This is of particular interest in the testing and grading of ghee. Here again, to arrive at the possible limits of variation of the chemical constants due to the feeding of vanaspathi, further feeding trials with a large number of cows and extending over an entire lactation are necessary. SUMMARY (1) Coconut and groundnut vanaspathis were fed to the Scindhi cows and Murrah buffaloes at the rate of 1½ lb. per head per day for a fortnight.
244 Influence of Dietary Fat on yield and Composition of Butterfat (2) Milk yield of cows decreased in both cases but buffaloes gave slightly increased milk yield with coconut vanaspathi and slightly, decreased yield on groundnut vanaspathi. (3) The fat percentage of the milk of cows fed on groundnut vanaspathi went down and that of cows fed on coconut increased a little but both the vanaspathis increased the fat percentage of the milk of buffaloes. (4) Due to the fall in both the milk yield and fat percentage, the daily output of the fat of cows decreased when either of the vanaspathis was fed. But buffaloes showed an increase in the daily output of fat when receiving either of the vanaspathis due to the increase in both the yield of milk and the fat percentage of milk. (5) The composition of the butterfat was altered considerably in both cows and buffaloes due to the feeding of either of the vanaspathis. Hence in both the cases the butter could easily be suspected to be adulterated. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Our thanks are due to Dr. Zal R. Kothavalla for his keen interest and helpful suggestions in this work.

INVESTIGATIONS ON THE RESAZURIN TEST FOR ASSESSING THE HYGIENIC QUALITY OF MILK IN INDIA An enquiry carried out under a scheme financed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi By H. LAXMINARAYANA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 6 May 1946) THE resazurin reduction test has recently come into great prominence in some of the western countries as a rapid and discriminative method of judging the hygienic quality of milk. Resa- zurin passes through a series of colour changes from the original blue to lilac, mauve, purple pink and pink before being finally reduced to a colourless stage depending on the degree of activity of the organisms present in milk [Davis, 1939 and 1942] and it is also highly sensitive to leucocytes [Thomas and Davis, 1940]. For the routine testing of milk supplies, an one-hour resazurin reduction test has been recommended in which milk is graded according to the colour shade to which resazurin is reduced at the end of an hour's incubation at 37ºC. Taking the reduction of resazurin to a purple pink, pink or colourless stage at one hour as an indication of poor quality, Ramsdell et al [1935] and Barrett et al [1937] obtained a fairly good rela- tionship between resazurin and methylene blue reduction tests. There was, however, a poor correla- tion observed between the resazurin test and colony counts, although milks which did not reduce resazurin appreciably within one hour generally had low counts whilst high count milks usually reduced it within one hour. These workers also claim that the one hour resazurin test gives as much information as the longer methylene blue reduction test gives in 5 to 7 hours and that the test is very valuable in detecting physiologically abnormal and pathological milk on account of its great sensi- tiveness to leucocyte action. Davis et al [1939] found that of 422 samples graded 'good' (blue) by the one hour resazurin test, 59 failed methylene blue test and of 396 samples graded 'good' by methylene blue test, only 5 graded 'poor' (pink) and 28 'doubtful' (purple pink) by the resazurin test. Thomas and Davies [1940] found that 81 per cent of the samples examined by them passed or failed both resazurin test (purple pink in one hour) and methylene blue test (accredited standards246 Investigations on Resazurin Test EXPERIMENTAL The one-hour resazurin test, methylene blue reduction test and plate counts were carried out on some 650 samples of cow, buffalo and mixed (cow and buffalo) milks, drawn from different sources, namely ; (i) farm produced milk (herd samples from Imperial Dairy Research Institute and a private dairy herd nearby), (ii) village produced milk (from producer-retailers and street hawkers) and (iii) milk handled by private dairies (individual producers' supplies and bulk tank samples). In the case of farm produced milk, the samples were obtained at the time of production (morn- ing) and examined within 2 to 3 hours after keeping them in the refrigerator (40º-50ºF.) during the interval. Village produced milk samples and those from private dairies were brought to the laboratory in ice boxes and examined immediately. The latter class of milk probably included both morning and previous evening's productions and came to the dairies from city stables as well as from moffusil centres (10 to 12 miles). The interval between the times of production and examination in the case of village samples was from 5 to 6 hours while in the case of private dairies it varied from 5 to 16 hours. During this interval, the milk was exposed to atmospheric temperatures varying from 68º to 95ºF. (average morning temperatures in the late winter and early summer months in Bangalore). Methods. The plate counts were determined on milk agar at 37ºC. [cf. Ministry of Agriculture 1934] and the methylene blue reduction test was carried out according to Wilson's modified technique [Wilson, 1935] The method recommended by Davis [1939] and further described by Davis [1943] and Davis and Newland [1944] was followed for the one hour resazurin test. One ml. of 0.005 per cent resazurin solution (prepared from Eastman Kodak resazurin powder) was added to 10 ml. of milk and the tubes gently inverted twice to ensure proper mixing and placed in a water-bath at a temperature of 37º±0.5ºC. The methylene blue reduction tubes were also prepared and incubated and the samples plated out at the same time. At the end of one hour the resazurin tubes were gently inverted and the stage of reduction (colour of resazurin) noted. The colour shades shown by resazurin were quite distinct and well-defined and after a little experience it was possible to record them subjectively. In view of the wide differences in fat contents of Indian milks (from 3.5 per cent in cow's milk to 7.5 per cent in buffalo's milk), the exact matching of the colours presented some difficulties. Samples of milk having a low fat content showed deeper tints than those with high fat content and in addition it is possible that the slight yellow tinge in cow's milk due to carotene may affect the shades to some extent. As the colour shades observed in the case of mixed (cow and buffalo) milk with 5 to 5.5 per cent fat were found to agree fairly satis- factorily with those shown by all types of milk, they were taken as standards and painted on glass slides for reference in cases of doubt. It was observed in several cases that the resazurin reduction was very rapid at first but the cor- responding methylene blue reduction time was fairly long. In such anomalous cases, a microscopic examination of the milk smears was carried out. RESULTS The results of the one hour resazurin test, methylene blue reduction times and plate counts obtained for the different types of milks examined are summarized in Tables I to IV below. DISCUSSION The object of the investigation, as stated in the introduction, was to find out the applicability of the resazurin test for determining the hygienic quality of Indian milks. Accordingly the results have been interpreted so as to give indications on : (i) the stages of resazurin reduction to be used for grading Indian milks ; (ii) the comparative grading efficiency of the resazurin test ; and (iii) the effect of the conditions of production on the resazurin test.
H. LAXMINARAYANA 247 (i) Stages of resazurin reduction for grading Indian milks. Previous workers have generally adopted the purple pink stage as the borderline for grading milks. Davis [1939, 1942] has suggested the following standards for the one hour resazurin test : Blue to mauve............ Excellent to good Pink mauve............ Fair Purple pink............. Poor Pink.............. Bad Colourless............. Very bad The above standards, which are generally based on their comparison with the accredited standards (4½ hours in summer and 5½ hours in winter) for methylene blue reduction adopted in England, may need some modification before introduction in this country, as it is well known that temperature has a great effect on the dye reduction tests. According to Verma et al. [1944] and further experi- mental evidence obtained at the Imperial Dairy Research Institute, a standard of four hours (methy- lene blue reduction time) for grading milks into satisfactory and unsatisfactory categories appears to be more suitable for conditions prevailing in this part of the country. All milks having methylene blue reduction times above four hours may be considered to be satisfactory. It is also found that methylene blue reduction times between two and four hours indicate an average quality while those below two hours indicate a poor quality. Although these modified standards may also be found to be rigid, particularly in summer when the reduction times tend to be shorter for all classes of milks, they have been used for comparing the results of the resazurin test in the present study. TABLE I Distribution of the one hour resazurin readings and methylene blue reduction times One hour resazurin readings Methylene blue reduction times Over 4 hours (good) 2 to 4 hours (average) Below 2 hours (poor) TOTAL Blue, lilac and mauve . . . . . . 219 88 2 309 Pink mauve . . . . . . . . 45 47 1 93 Purple pink . . . . . . 41 43 9 93 Pink . . . . . . 2 25 29 56 Fading pink to colourless . . . . . .. 4 103 107 From an analysis of the distribution of the one hour resazurin readings at different levels of methylene blue reduction times (Table I), it is seen that about 70 per cent of the samples attaining the blue, lilac or mauve stages have passed the methylene blue standard of four hours ('good') with 28 per cent falling in the two to four hours class ('average'). The latter discrepancy is probably due to the methylene blue standard of four hours being too rigid for the summer samples. Similarly about 70 per cent of the samples passing the methylene blue standard of four hours have shown either the blue, lilac or mauve stages with 15 per cent reaching the pink mauve stage and 13 per cent, the purple pink stage. A good many samples in the pink mauve and purple pink stages were found to be associated with high leucocyte counts on (microscopic) examination which factor may be respon- sible in down-grading them on the resazurin scale, because methylene blue is comparatively less sensitive to the action of leucocytes [Davis et al. 1943 ; Thomas and Bowie, 1944]. There is thus close relationship between the resazurin reduction up to mauve stage and methylene blue reduction standard of four hours ('good'). A similar relationship is observed between the resazurin reduction up to the fading pink or colourless stage and methylene blue reduction below two hours ('poor'). Almost all the samples H
248 Investigations on Resazurin Test attaining a fading pink or colourless stage show methylene blue reduction times below two hours, while 72 per cent of the samples with reduction times below two hours have attained the fading pink or colourless stage with 20 per cent reaching the pink stage. Samples with reduction times between two and four hours ('average') are found to be fairly distributed over all the stages from blue to pink in a decreasing order while the samples attaining the pink mauve or purple pink stages are distributed evenly between the 'good' and 'average' categories and those attaining the pink stage between the 'average' and 'poor' categories on the methylene blue scale. It was also found that several samples in the pink stage were associated with heavy leucocyte counts and long-chained streptococci and staphylococci (possibly due to mastitis infection). The pink mauve and purple pink stages, therefore, appear to correspond with the 'average' category on the methylene blue scale while the pink stage agrees with a grade inferior to this. On the basis of the above results, the following standards for grading milks according to the one hour resazurin readings appear to be satisfactory. One hour resazurin reading Grade 1.

LAXMINARAYANA 249 It will be seen from Table II that there is a fairly good agreement between the one-hour resazurin readings and methylene blue reduction times. About 86 per cent of cow milk samples, 68 per cent of buffalo milk samples and 60 per cent of mixed milk samples that passed the resazurin test (reduc- tion up to mauve stage) have also passed the methylene blue reduction test (above four hours), the rest of them showing reduction times between two and four hours, while almost all the samples (cow, buffalo and mixed) that have been graded 'poor' or 'bad' by the resazurin test (pink or colourless at one hour) have also failed the methylene blue test (below four hours). Further, the samples reach- ing the colourless stage show methylene blue reduction times mostly below two hours. The failure of some 30 per cent of the above samples, mixed milks in particular which were samples from bulk milks and exposed to atmospheric temperatures for a longer time, to pass the methylene blue test while satisfying the resazurin test is probably due to the methylene blue standard of four hours being too rigid. According to Thomas [1943], this apparently faster methylene blue reduction may also be due to the different times at which the two reductions are recorded. Resazurin reduction in one hour is influenced mainly by initial bacterial activity and accumulated products of bacterial meta- bolism while methylene blue is in addition affected by bacterial activity developed during its longer incubation period. This closer relation to the initial flora shown by resazurin is one of the advantages claimed for it [Davis, 1942]. As regards the samples that turned pink mauve or purple pink at the end of one hour ('average' quality), about 67 per cent of cow milks, 37 per cent of buffalo milks and 14 per cent of mixed milks have passed the methylene blue test and the rest show reduction times between two and four hours. Looking at the results from another angle it is seen that out of the samples that stood the methylene blue test, only 54 per cent of the cow samples, 85 per cent of buffalo milks and 82 per cent of mixed milks have passed the resazurin test, the rest coming under the 'average' category (pink mauve or purple pink). The responsibility for the down-grading of most of these samples, particularly cow milks, on the resazurin scale may be ascribed to the presence of numerous leucocyte cells (colostrum, late lactation milk or mastitis infection) and other weak reducing substances in milk which have a greater reducing effect on resazurin [Thomas, 1943 ; Davis et al. 1943]. This effect seems to be least in the case of mixed milks which represent bulk samples where the leucocyte content would have been levelled out or inactivated due to age. It is also seen that out of the. samples that have failed the methylene blue test, only about 58 per cent of cows milks, 33 per cent of buffalo milks and 47 per cent of mixed milks have been placed in the 'poor' or 'bad' categories by the resazurin test, the rest being placed either in the 'good' or 'average' category by the latter test. As explained above the high standard of four hours as well as the difference in the factors which influence the two reductions may be responsible for a larger number of samples belonging to this class failing the methylene blue test than the resazurin test. Another significant point that has emerged is the comparatively slower rate of resazurin reduction in the case of buffalo milks up to the mauve or pink mauve stage and accordingly the above anomaly is shown to the greatest extent in their case. The causes underlying some of these anomalies can be fully explained only after further investigations, but these have not detracted the practical value of the test to any appreciable extent. In any case, a good number of samples (about 50 per cent) which would be condemned on the rigid methylene blue standard are found to be useful or at least of an average quality by the resazurin test on account of its greater flexibility in grading milks while a large number of abnormal or pathological samples (about 30 per cent), which may be found unsuitable for either human consumption or manufacturing purposes and which are passed by the methylene blue reduction test are weeded out by the resazurin test.

LAXMINARAYANA 251 the dye reduction tests. There were only a few samples of mixed milk in this category. Again most of the samples with colony counts over one million in the case of all the three types of milk have failed both resazurin and methylene blue tests. As regards the intermediate samples with colony counts between 200,000 and one million per ml., about 40 per cent of cow milks have passed both the tests, the rest coming mostly under the 'average' category. About 80 per cent of buffalo milks and 61 per cent of mixed milks have passed the resazurin test while about 50 per cent of both buffalo and mixed milks have passed the methylene blue test. It is thus seen that there is a fairly good agreement between the two reduction tests and the plate counts in the case of low count (below 200,000 per ml.) and high count (over 1 million per ml.) samples and that the resazurin test is as reliable as the methylene blue-reduction test in detecting high count milks [Thomas, 1943]. In the case of low count milks, particularly as some of them were examined in winter when bacterial activity is less pronounced, the effect of cells becomes more import- ant which may result in the resazurin test showing a poorer correlation with the plate counts. This effect is practically masked in high count samples. The above observation serves to demonstrate the superiority of methylene blue reduction as a measure of mere bacterial numbers. If, however, the term 'sanitary quality' in milk is to denote freedom from excessive bacterial contamination as well as any abnormality (physiological or pathological), this factor should not militate against the value of the resazurin test. The relationship in the case of intermediate samples with counts between 200,000 and one million per ml. is poor. A greater number of samples in this category, particularly buffalo milks, seem to fail the methylene blue test than the resazurin test thus indicating a higher degree of agree- ment between the methylene blue test and plate counts. (iii) Effect of conditions of production on the resazurin test In the course of this investigation samples drawn from three different sources namely, farm produced milk, village produced milk and milk handled by private dairies (which give a fair representa- tion of the usual conditions of production and handling in this part of the country) have been used. It is well known that the quality of milk is influenced to a large extent by the conditions of produc- tion and handling and as the resazurin test is to be employed for determining the same, it may be interesting to examine how far the test throws light on the above factors. TABLE IV Effect of conditions of production of the resazurin test One hour resazurin reading Source of sample Farm produced Village produced Milk handled by private dairies Blue to mauve . . . . . . . . . . 215 70 24 Pink mauve and purple pink . . . . . . . . . . 108 36 38 Pink . . . . . . . . . . 13 16 20 Colourless . . . . . . . . . . 7 41 65 Total number of samples . . 348 163 147 An examination of the above data (Table IV) reveals that about 63 per cent of farm produced milks, 43 per cent of village produced milks and 16 per cent of milks from private dairies have been graded 'good ' by the resazurin test.
252 Investigations on Resazurin Test Similarly about 7 per cent, 35 per cent and 58 per cent of the three classes of milk respectively have failed the resazurin test, with about 30 per cent of farm produced milks and 25 per cent of the other two classes being placed in the 'average' category. Thus the test has clearly brought out the marked gradation in the bacteriological quality of milks drawn from the three sources which is in conformity with their actual conditions of production and handling. Farm produced milk is obtain- ed under hygienic conditions and is least exposed to atmospheric temperature while the other two classes of milk have been generally produced under unhygienic conditions and carelessly handled. In addition, the milk from private dairies represents bulk milks collected from various sources and is most exposed to atmospheric temperature. Accordingly the latter class of milk has a high bacterial content and is rich in coliform and other actively reducing types of bacteria which bring about a rapid reduction of resazurin. The down-grading of a large number of samples in the case of farm produced milk to the 'average' (30 per cent) and 'unsatisfactory' (7 per cent) categories cannot be explained on the basis of their conditions of production. But it has already been indicated, while comparing the resazurin test with methylene blue reduction and plate count, that most of the samples placed in these categories showed heavy leucocyte contents associated with abnormal milks (colostrum, late lactation milk or mastitis) and accordingly, cellular activity may be responsible for the rapid reduction of resazurin in the case of these samples. A separate investigation carried out into the cause of this revealed that nearly 25 to 30 per cent of the animals in the herds, from which the samples were obtained, were suffering from mastitis more or less of a severe form associated with streptococci, staphylococci or corynebacteria and shedding numerous cells in the milk. It is thus evident that the resazurin test is fairly reliable in indicating bad methods of produc- tion, but in the case of milk produced under careful conditions and therefore having a low bacterial content, the effect of leucocytes becomes more pronounced and a misleading picture may sometimes be obtained. In actual practice this may not be a serious factor since cellular activity in milk does not ordinarily reduce resazurin beyond the pink stage [Davis, 1942] and a producer's supply would not be graded down to the rejection class (colourless) on account of cell content only. On the other hand it may be highly advantageous in drawing attention to the presence of serious mastitis in a herd. SUMMARY 1. The application of the one-hour resazurin reduction test at 37°C. for judging the quality of Indian milks has been examined by comparing it with the standard methylene blue reduction test and plate count using some 650 samples of cow, buffalo and mixed (cow and buffalo) milks drawn from different sources. 2. Based on their comparison with a methylene blue reduction time of 4 hours (found suitable for conditions prevailing in this part of the country), the following modified standards for grading milks according to the resazurin stages at one hour have been used for comparing the results of the different tests : (i) Blue, lilac or mauve . . . . . . . . . . . . . Good (ii) Pink mauve or purple pink. . . . . . . . . . . Average (iii) Pink . . . . . . . . . . . . . Poor (iv) Colourless . . . . . . . . . . . . . Bad 3. A fairly good agreement between the two reduction tests has been found. About 70 per cent of all the samples passing resazurin test (blue to mauve stages) have also passed the methylene blue reduction test (4 hours) while almost all the samples placed in the 'poor' or 'bad' categories (pink or colourless) by the resazurin test have failed the former test. 4. About 30 per cent of the samples passing the methylene blue test have been placed in the 'average' category (pink mauve or purple pink) by the resazurin test while 50 per cent of the samples failing the former test have been up-graded by the latter. The causes for these anomalies have been discussed and the greater efficiency of the resazurin test in detecting abnormal milks with high leuco- cyte counts (colostrum, late lactation or mastitis milks) as also its greater flexibility in placing milks
H. LAXMINARAYANA 253 condemned by the methylene blue test, in the intermediate categories ('average' and 'poor') have been brought out. It has also been observed that the reduction of resazurin in the case of buffalo milks is generally slower up to the mauve or pink mauve stage. 5. Most of the samples with colony counts over one million per ml. have failed both the reduc- tion tests and the reliability of resazurin test in detecting high count milks has been indicated. In the case of samples with plate counts below 200,000 per mil. about 90 per cent have passed the methylene blue test with only 70 per cent passing the resazurin test. A higher degree of correlation between the methylene blue test and plate count has thus been shown. The causes for this have been attributed to the higher sensitiveness of resazurin to the influence of leucocytes as also the shorter period of its incubation (one hour compared to four hours or longer in the case of methylene blue test). 6. The resazurin test has been found to be useful in picking out milk produced under insanitary conditions while in the case of carefully produced milks, it may give misleading results due to the influence of cellular activity on resazurin reduction. The value of the test for drawing attention to serious cases of mastitis in a herd and for detecting admixture of colostral, late lactation and mastitis milks in the supplies has also been pointed out.

C., Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry), Hyderabad- Deccan (Received for Publication on 3 April 1946) (With Plate XI) MARTIN and Robertson [1911] recorded trichomonads in the caeca of fowls, but true infection with these flagellates has not so far been recorded in fowls in this country. A first case of this kind was observed by the writer in 1943 in Hyderabad State. The organisms are known to produce lesions, sometimes fatal, in the upper digestive tract of birds. The similar disease, caused by Tricho- monas columbae, is reported to exist in pigeons as well as in fowls in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, and is characterized by the presence of necrotic areas in the liver, pericardium and peritonium. In some instances the lungs and pancreas are also involved. The flagellates are found in the mouth, oesophagus and crop of older birds. Recently, Levine and Brandly [1940] have shown that T. gallinae produces lesions in the upper digestive tract of baby chicks, appearing as multiple caseous foci of the mucous membrane. Young pigeons are believed to become infected from older carrier birds through the medium of the 'pigeon milk' [Brocklehurst, 1944]. The writer [1946] has also recorded the existence of T. columbae in the upper digestive tract of young pigeons but the pathogenecity of these flagellates is yet to be determined in pigeons and other birds. The clinical manifestations observed in the present case were dullness, inappetence, emaciation, yellow diarrhoea, incoordination of movement and twitching of the neck. Such symptoms however are common to many other poultry diseases. Microscopical examinations of blood and faeces during life failed to give any positive indication of the cause of ailment. It was, therefore, considered neces- sary to destroy the bird to ensure a correct diagnosis. The fowl was a desi pullet and had been ailing for at least a week. On autopsy the changes noted were confined to the liver, which was enlarged and which presented several extensive areas of necrosis ; among these were one or two areas as big as marbles. There was a sharp lines of demarca- tion between the affected and the normal tissues. The lesions were creamy-white in colour and con- tained caseous material, such as might be found in tuberculous lesions. No changes in other internal organs were observed, except for some inflammation of the mucous lining of the intestine and en- largement of the caeca. The diagnosis was made by examining wet films of tissue from the lesions in the liver. Under 1/6th lens, actively motile flagellates were demonstrated, pear-shaped organisms with flagella and undulating membrane (Plate XI). Further microscopical studies were made on impression smears from lesions, stained by Leishman's stain. Large numbers of flagellates were then seen in two forms, spindle-shaped and round. There were three free flagella and one bordering the undulating membrane. All the four flagella originated from a blepharoplast situated at the anterior end of the para- site. The undulating membrane stained a pinkish colour, while the basal fibre was deep blue. The nucleus was prominently placed, anterior to the middle of the body, and granular substance was found scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Plate XI, fig. 1). Multiplication by longitudinal fission, with components of two or four organisms, was also observed (Plate XI, fig. 2). The average size of the protozoa was 10 × 8 microns. The material collected from this case, viz., from liver, lungs, kidney, spleen, duodenum and caeca, and also impression smears from the liver lesions, were sent to the Protozoologist, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, for examination, and he identified the protozoa as T. gallinae. It was also stated that the macroscopic lesions in the liver were typical of trichomonas infection but that histopathological examination of other specimens failed to reveal any protozoal infection. The necrotic areas in the liver showed numerous T. gallinae. If left uncontrolled, this disease may become a menace to poultry under existing conditions, as over-crowding, insanitation, rapid exchange of poultry population between rural and urban areas, and rearing of chicks under desi carrier brooder hens, may help to disseminate infection. It is there- fore necessary to collect reliable information, the extent of mortality and damage caused by this 254

S. NURUL MOHTEDA 255 disease. This would involve laboratory and clinical research, which might be undertaken on the lines suggested by Brocklehurst [1944]. She recommends the detection of carrier birds by examining scrapings from the oesophageal mucosa for flagellates and those found infected could be treated with 1 per cent trypaflavine. Hinshaw [1937] states that of the treatments tried, the substitution of a 1 to 2000 solution of copper sulphate, prepared with soft water in an earthenware vessel, for the drinking water was the only successful one. This mixture should be kept before the birds for two or three days and the procedure repeated after a few days. During treatment, the birds should have access to no other water supply. This treatment was recommended for the trichomonas which invade the upper digestive tract while those which are found in the lower digestive tract, Olsen and Allen [1940] have attained success in treating the disease by the use of fever therapy, which is accomplished by placing the infected birds for one to two hours in a thermostatically controlled cabinet in which the internal temperatures of the birds were raised from 2º to 6ºF. above normal by main- taining the temperature of the chamber at approximately 104°F. with a relative humidity of 60 to 70 per cent. Three treatments at intervals of every other day were sufficient to check the disease in most cases. To control the disease Oehlkers [1937] suggests elimination of carriers and the use of only healthier birds for hatching and rearing. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The writer is indebted to Dr H. N.

ABSTRACTS Salmonella infections of the domestic animals. Their relationship to salmonellosis (Food infection in man). FRANK W. SCHOFIELD (1945) Canadian J. Comp. Med. 9, 62 IN this article the increasing importance of the Salmonella group and of Salmonella infections in man and animals is emphasized. The Salmonella group is already a large one comprising numerous species, and new one are being added. Many of the members of the group cannot be distinguished from one another by the usual cultural methods, but only by means of an analysis of the antigenic structure. At present over 60 different types of animal origin have been isolated from human disease which indicates the great importance of an adequate knowledge of animal Salmonella infections and their relationship to disease in man. The important characteristics of Salmonella infection in animals are : (1) The great majority of Salmonella infections are of the gastro-intestinal tract, (2) In most cases the young are attacked more frequently than mature or old animals, e.g., white diarrhoea of chicks, paratyphoid in young pigs, etc., (3) Salmonella carriers are of common occurrence, (4) Salmonella infections are much more common in swine and poultry than in other animal species, (5) The Salmonella cause infections in a variety of animal species, and few of the many types isolated are limited to a single host. The author refers to the work of Edward and Burnner who isolated from various sources 70 Sal- monella types, of which 42 proved to be from fowls and 28 from swine. However, the author emphasizes that while many Salmonella types have been reported, especially from poultry, not more than half-a-dozen types are serious animal pathogens causing widespread disease and serious economic loss. These are: S. cholerae-suis, S. typhi- murium, S. enteritidis, S. pullorum, S. anatis, S. abortivo-equina, S. schott-mülleri, S. enteritidis. var. dublin For the diseases caused in animals by these organisms, the original should be consulted. The Salmonella infections in man can be divided clinically into three types : Salmonella fever, Salmonella septi- caemia, and Salmonella gastro-enteritis. The more important characteristics of these types are as follows : Salmonella fever. This resembles the typhoid state but is of shorter duration lasting 1 to 3 weeks. Fever and malaise are the dominant symptoms. Blood cultures are usually positive in the early stages of the disease. Salmonella septicaemia. The clinical picture is that of blood infection. Localization of the infection may occur in almost any part of the body. The meninges and endocardium seem to be tissues of predilection. Salmonella gastro-enteritis. There is usually an interval of 8 to 24 hours between the consumption of the contaminated food and the appearance of symptoms. This is longer than in staphylococcal food poisoning. Vomiting is usually the first symptom to occur followed by diarrhoea. The fever subsides in 3 to 4 days and the disease rarely lasts longer than one week. Live bacteria are present in the intestinal tract and are responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. There does not appear to be much support for the view originally put forward by Savage that the symptoms can also result from the heat-stable toxins liberated by the bacteria during the process of cooking. The types of Salmonella found in different kinds of food are described . Among the methods that should be adopted for the prevention of infection in man the author discusses meat inspection, both ante-mortem and post- mortem, prevention of ' emergency slaughter', inspection of places where food is stored to prevent contamination with the faeces of carriers, pasteurization and cooking, the examination of personnel engaged in the preparation and cooking of food, refrigeration, etc. In a word, prevention hinges on adequate food hygiene. [L. S.] The Treatment of caecal coccidiosis with sulfamethazine. PHILLIP A. HAWKINS AND E. E. KLINE (1945). Poultry Science 24, 277-281 IN this article the authors have demonstrated that death losses due to caecal coccidiosis can be greatly diminished by administering sulfamethazine in concentrations of 0.4 to 1.0 per cent in the feed for a period of three days after the fourth day of infection. Treatment started five days after infection results in heavy mortality. To prevent loss it is necessary that the blood levels of the drug should reach 5.0 to 6.0 mg. per cent by the fifth day. Saturated solution of the drug in water served in galvanized iron containers is ineffective, while in paraffined vessels the results are shown to be variable. It has, however, been pointed out that sulfamethazine interferes with the normal weight gains of uninfected birds. The great value of this drug against caecal coccidiosis in well c trolled battery experi- ments is recognized but some doubt is expressed on its utility under farm conditions where the diagnosis of the disease at the required early stage is not possible. [H. N. R.] Effect of feeding iodinated casein on production and health of milking cows. D. M. SEATH, C. BRANTON and A. H. GROTH (1945). J. Dairy Sci. 28, 509 THE experimental work consists in examining the effect of feeding milch cows with iodinated casein (Protamone, manufactured by Ccrophyl Laboratories, Kanasas City). The influence of feeding on the fat percentage of of milk, daily milk yield, body weight changes, pulse rate and body temperature was studied. Two sets of experiment were carried out. The first, which consisted of short-term feeding tests, was based on the reversal trial procedure. Six cows in all were used, three serving as control (Group II), the rest (Group I) received iodinated casein for eight weeks. After the first test period, no protamine was given to any animal for throe weeks. 256
Abstracts. 257 Group II animals were then given the test substance for seven weeks, Group I now serving as controls. Iodinated casein was fed during both the test period at the rate of 15 gm. daily per animal. Protamine feeding consistently caused increased fat excretion in milk as well as higher daily milk yield, but the animals lost weight heavily. Pulse rate of protamine-fed animals was always 10-13 beats higher than the control cows. Their body temperature was also higher and more sensitive to atmospheric changes than that of the control cows. In the second experiment, long-term feeding with iodinated casein was studied. Twelve animals were divided into two groups of six each. The cows in the experimental group received iodinated casein, usually at the rate of 1.5 gm. daily per 100 lb body weight, but the rates were changed in some cases after the first four weeks in an effort to effect increased production without causing large losses in body weight. The total feeding period lasted from 10 to 13 weeks. In contrast to the previous experiment, iodinated casein feeding showed higher fat excretion for the first six weeks only and increased milk yield for the first five weeks, but following this the control cows averaged higher production. The average weight loss was 32 lb whereas control animals showed an increase of 36 lb during the same period. Pulse rate and body temperature increases in the iodinated casein-fed group were similar to those seen in the first experiment. It is doubtful whether the increased production secured by feeding iodinated casein would be great enough or would continue over a long enough period to justify possible injury to milch cows through losses in body weight, increases in pulse rates and higher body temperature.

J. 30, 57258 Abstracts. Rinderpest in game. A description of an outbreak and an attempt at limiting its spread by means of a bush fence. A. D. THOMAS and N. R. REID. (1944). Onderstepoort. J. vet. Sci. 20, 7-20. A BRIEF review is given of the history of rinderpest in Central East Africa and measures taken to check its spread. The authors describe an outbreak of what they believed to be rinderpest in game in the lake Rukwa area in Tanganyika Territory where it assumed a state of epizooticity. The animals affected were wild buffalo, eland and kudus. The symptoms and lesions as seen in these animals while suggestive of rinderpest were not very typical; but subinoculation from affected buffaloes and elands into susceptible young cattle and goats proved that these animals suffered from rinderpest. The possibility of such game areas acting as reservoirs of the disease with the probability that it may spread to- contiguous cattle or game, particularly in the dry season, is suggested. A type of bush fencing about 8 to 10 ft. high, erected with local labour at a cost of approximately £40 to £50 per mile, is reported to be effective in preventing the passage of game from affected areas to the adjacent healthy side when built with care and if properly maintained. [J. A. I.] Dried cow manure and dried rumen contents as a partial substitute for alfalfa leaf meal. J. C. HAMMOND (1944). Poultry Sci. 23, 471-476 THE growth rate, mortality and efficiency of feed utilization of 1,680 chicks were observed up to the age of 6-10 weeks, with a view to compare the value of alfalfa leaf meal and several of its substitutes in supplementing a simple wartime diet which was adequate in vitamin A and B2. The resultant rations were composed of ground wheat (50.55 per cent), soyabean meal (35.00 per cent), alfalfa leaf meal or substitute (8.00 per cent), B-Y feed (2.00 per cent), steamed bone meal (2.00 per cent), ground limestone (1.25 per cent), manganized salt (1.00 per cent) and vitamin A and D feeding oil (0.20 per cent). Cow manure dried at 21°C-160°C. and rumen contents dried at 47°C. were definitely superior to the other substitutes and even to alfalfa leaf meal. When 2 per cent sardine fish meal was fed a long with the latter, the performance of the birds was comparable to that of the chicks receiving cow manure with and without the addition of fish meal. The androgen content of cow manure, which stimulates comb and wattle growth, was apparent in the manure dried at 47°C. but was destroyed by slow drying at room temperature (21°C.) and by drying at 80°C. or above in an oven. Rumen contents were richer in riboflavin than cow manure. It is considered necessary to add vitamin A, and in some cases riboflavin, to the ration if these materials are used as partial substitutes for alfalfa leaf meal. [R. M.] The effect of fat upon the digestion of nutrients by dairy cows. H. L. LUCAS and J. K. LOOSHI (1944). J. of Anim. Sci. 3, 3-11 TWO series of digestion trials were carried out to test whether different levels and different sources of fat had any effect on digestibility and production value of the various rations of dairy cows. With Timothy hay and dried beet pulp as the basic feeds, the differences in fat intake were adjusted by using concentrates of different ether extract content. In the first series of experiments the rations contained 1.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent ether extract. The results of the feeding trial showed that this difference in fat level of the rations had no statistically significant effect on the digestibility of the various nutrients except of ether extract. In the second series, rations of different fat levels and sources were formulated by using several soyabean products of varying fat content. Out of the six rations tested, two, (1) partially heated soyabean meal and (b) toasted meal contained about 1.0 per cent ether extract, the other four (a) ground beans, (b) toasted meal plus soya oil, (c) toasted meal plus corn oil and (d) toasted meal plus fatty acids contained about 7.0 per cent ether extract. The results indicated that (a) digestibility of the dry matter, nitrogen-free-extract and crude fibre in the rations containing ground soyabeans and toasted meal plus oil was lower than those of other rations and (b) the ether extract of the high fat rations was significantly more digestible than that of the low fat rations. Amongst the high fat rations again, the ether extract of the rations containing oil and fatty acids was significantly more digestible than the ether extract of the ration con taming ground soyabeans. As regards protein digestibility, although it was lowest on the soyabeans ration and highest on the ration containing toasted meal plus fatty acids, the differences were not signi- ficant. In regard to the effect on milk and butter fat production, the feeding of ground soyabeans caused marked in- crease in the fat content of milk with practically no change in milk yield. On the other hand, the feeding of the oils, or fatty acids, caused a marked drop in milk flow with little change in fat percentage. It was also found that the production of butter fat and fat-corrected milk had no definite correlation with the actual intakes of ether extract and total digestible nutrients. [N. K. A.]

R. HADDOW and J. A. IDNANI, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 17 June 1946) (With two text-figures) EDWARDS [1927] by attenuating and fixing rinderpest virus in goats has provided India with a reliable and safe means of vaccinating plains cattle. The larger problem being solved, the demand for providing for the more susceptible populations of the hills, for buffaloes, particularly those in milk or in-calf, and for sheep and goats has become more insistent. This demand has been accen- tuated by the wider movement of these animals necessitated by the war. Vaccination with goat virus alone in these species gives rise to an unpleasantly large number of severe reactions, which may even be followed by deaths varying in extent with local conditions. The use of small doses of serum to damp down such reactions is now almost universal, but this is expensive and unwieldy when large herds or flocks have to be protected. The annual reports of this Institute contain many re- ferences to attempts at simplifying the procedure, but none of these has proved acceptable to field workers. It was decided at the beginning of the war that the position should be reviewed and fresh efforts made to find a satisfactory solution. Entirely satisfactory results have not been attained, but progress in certain directions was achieved and this is now recorded. Three different strains of virus were available for experiment, (1) line E, a highly virulent epidemic ox strain causing about 90 per cent mortality in hill-bulls, (2) line D, and old laboratory passaged strain of ox origin causing about 12 per cent mortality, (3) line W, the goat-fixed strain causing about 12 per cent mortality. As buffaloes were seldom available, experiments were made on hill-bulls, the mortality in which is considerably higher than in buffaloes. ALUMINA-GEL VACCINE * Haddow and Idnani [1941] reported that fowls could be vaccinated against Ranikhet disease with a virus adsorbed on alumina-gels. Small-scale experiments were carried out on similar lines on goats using vaccines made separately from line E and line W viruses. Six goats were vaccinated with each type of vaccine. Only three in each group became available for test and all were found to be solidly immune. The work however, was not continued, because the difficulties of preparing and transporting such a vaccine under field conditions in India would clearly be almost insurmountable. FORMALIZED VACCINE Formalized vaccines prepared with line E and line W viruses were also tried on a small scale in goats. These were prepared somewhat on the lines of Daubney [1928]. Spleen pulp was formalized 1: 1000 in nutrient broth and stored at 5°C. Vaccine prepared with line E virus was tested after three and seven days on six goats each time, and that prepared with line W was inoculated into six goats after six day's storage. No alteration of the viruses was perceived and owing to the high cost of such a vaccine the work was dropped. GLYCEROLIZED VACCINE Since the year 1918 when Kakizaki initiated the method, several workers have made trails with glycerolized vaccine. Bennett [1936] reported a series of experiments carried out in the Sudan.
2 Vaccination Against Rinderpest. Infected spleens collected at the height of reaction were minced and to this twice the quantity (by weight) of 60 per cent glycerol was added. This product was then aged either at 37°C. or at 0°C. Bennett concluded that glycerolized spleen pulp was rendered safe for vaccination purposes by storage either for three days at 37°C. or for three months at 0°C. Stress was laid on dosageJ. R.

The period of ageing of the vaccine was then further reduced to 24 hours in one lot and 30 hours in another. The result of this experiment is given in Table III.

After the vaccine has been rendered safe, a fairly large dose has to be employed to ensure protection. Another brew of glycerolized vaccine was now prepared with line D virus and tested after 18, 24 and 48 hours at 37°C. (Table IV).

Vaccination of goats. Vaccines were prepared with line E and line W viruses. A few tests were also made on hill-bulls. TABLE V Glycerolized vaccines in goats (line E) and hillJ. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 5 These results, considered as a whole, confirm the findings of Bennett, except that higher doses are required for completely satisfactory results in susceptible hill-cattle and goats. No opportunity for field trials presented itself, but we are of the opinion that for general purposes the method would prove too expensive in goats, and by analogy possibly also in buffaloes although this species was not available for experiment. A further observation during the course of routine work was that line E or line D viruses, when inoculated directly into goats or sheep, gave rise to much milder reactions that when goat virus was used. In fact, in these animals it appeared that line D virus could be used as a vaccine. Thus, out of six goats and four sheep inoculated directly with line D virus, all showed a mild thermal reaction and, except one goat which died of other causes, all survived. Field trials are to be arranged. RABBIT VIRUS VACCINE Edwards [1924] reported that rinderpest could be transmitted to rabbits, but unfortunately the strain obtained by him died out before final conclusions could be drawn as to its vaccinating properties. In earlier years, [Haddow (unpublished)] numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to confirm Edwards' work, using line D and the fixed goat strain. Morcos [1931] tried to infect guinea-pigs, rabbits, white rats and dogs with rinderpest virus, by feeding or inoculation. No attempt was made to extend the scope of the experiments by transferring the virus from these animals into bovines. No laboratory animal used by him is reported to have contracted rinderpest. Inoue [1934] passaged a laboratory strain of bovine rinderpest virus to rabbits up to the 50th generation. Nakamura, Wagatuma and Fukusho [1938] carried out extensive systematic studies on the effect of serial passage of rinderpest virus in rabbits. They concluded that the virus was reduced in virulence for cattle, and after the 100th passage test calves often survived after developing more or less distinct symptoms. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.6 Vaccination Against Rinderpest When a newly-isolated epidemic strain became available to us, fresh efforts were made to passage it in rabbits. In two attempts success was immediately achieved. Transmission was started by inoculating 5 c.c. blood subcutaneously and intra-venously to two pairs of rabbits. The pair ino- culated intravenously gave the most marked reaction. Three cubic centimetres of pooled blood from all four rabbits was subinoculated subcutaneously into a pair of rabbits. Subsequent passages were carried out with pooled blood subcutaneously into two rabbits. As with previous successful attempts, the only symptom in the rabbit was a rise of temperature on third or fourth day, which was not very marked in the first few passages but later was always distinct (Fig. 1). The temperature fell after two to four days and the rabbits invariably recovered. As the work progressed, it was discovered that rabbits four or five months old are much the best material for passage, older rabbits giving variable reactions. The virus may persist in the blood for fourteen days and in the spleen for twelve days, though the virus is not present in large quantity. Simultaneously we repeated the experiments with lines D and W, but with entirely negative results. We are therefore of the opinion that, if transmission to rabbits is to be successful, it is essential to use a fully virulent strain. The results of tests on bulls, goats and buffaloes are recorded in Table VI.

J. R. HADDOW AND J. A. INDANI 7 TABLE VI8 Vaccination Against Rinderpest TABLE VIJ. R. HADDOW AND J. A. IDNANI 9 It will be seen from Table VI that the virus transmitted through rabbits remained virulent for bulls up to about the 50th passage, in which from the 55th passage onwards there was a defi- nite and gradual decrease in virulence. None of the bulls inoculated after the 55th passage showed any symptom other than rise of temperature, usually rather later than normal, (Fig. 2) and this type of reaction was obtained as far as the 154th passage, after which reactions were uncertain though they remained typical in rabbits. It will also be observed that the virus does not stand storage well, even at refrigerator temperatures ; reliable results could not be obtained from the fifth day onwards and in this respect rabbit virus is much more fragile than goat fixed virus. The average virus content of rabbits would also appear to be much lower; hence less dilute suspensions must be used. The results in goats were similar to those obtained in bulls. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 2. Rabbit passage 60. In buffaloes, three field trials were arranged in co-operation with the Military Farms. (i) At the first of these, one of us (J. A. I.) inoculated eleven milch buffaloes and ten goats with rabbit virus from passage 126, the amount used being 1.0 c.c. of 1: 100 suspension of rabbit spleen. The virus was taken to the place of inoculation in live rabbits. These buffaloes and goats showed slight reaction to the vaccination and all were immune on test 21 days later. There was no inter- ference with the buffaloe's milk yield. (ii) The second test was carried out by the Indian Military Veterinary Laboratory. From passage 161 a few serial passages were continued at that laboratory and altogether 469 buffaloes were inocu- lated. The dose given was 1 c.c. of a 1 : 100 spleen suspension which was used on the day of pre- paration. The temperature and milk yield of sixty animals were recorded for fourteen days after vaccination. No systemic disturbance was observed and milk yields were unaffected. Sixteen of these buffaloes chosen at random were tested 110 Vaccination Against Rinderpest six showed a more or less severe reaction and recovered, while two died of acute rinderpest. As some of these buffaloes were probably immune before vaccination, it appears that at best successful ' takes ' occurred in only a small percentage. (iii) Owing to the hot weather, the temperature reactions in rabbits at the Military Veterinary Laboratory were difficult to define and it was therefore decided to repeat the trial with fresh material from Mukteswar and to use stronger suspensions of both liver and spleen. Accordingly, the 176th passage in rabbits was sent in live rabbits, and was passaged once only at the Laboratory. Material from this passage was inoculated into: Group 1.SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMMUNIZATION OF SHEEP AND GOATS AGAINST RINDERPEST By H. K. LALL, B. Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Government Livestock Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 4 July 1946) OUTBREAKS of rinderpest have been observed in sheep and goats from time to time in various parts of India by Bawa [1940], Chowdhry [1941] and various other workers (personal communica- tion). A rise in the incidence of the disease in these animals occurred during recent years. It was considered that that was due to an increase in the animal traffic to various battle fronts in and outside India. Ten outbreaks were recorded in the year 1943-44 in Ambala Division of the Punjab alone, causing very heavy mortality. Cattle were not affected in these outbreaks. It became apparent that some definite steps were required to devise methods of immunization. Anti-rinderpest serum has been tried by various field workers, with varying results in affected animals but it did not prove very effective in controlling the outbreak at Hissar. Bawa [ibid] reported that in goats the use of anti-serum alone was not very satisfactory, specially because of the short duration of immunity. In sheep, however, Bawa [1939] reported that the use of goatis was a success as a prophylactic against rinderpest. Srikantiah [1934] and Viswanathan [1937] have mentioned the use of anti-rinderpest serum in sheep as an essential adjunct to goatis to avoid severe reaction, but Viswanathan reports 3.6 per cent mortality from vaccination, in spite of the serum. These authors do not mention the breed of sheep used in their experiments. Gopal Singh (personal communication) tried goatis on sheep and goats as a prophylanis in face of outbreaks of rinderpest in Gurgoan district. With a view to produce immunity against rinderpest, some experiments were conducted at Hissar and the following observations were made. In this note the term ' goatis ' has been used for goat tissue vaccine; a mild reaction was determined by the fact that the animal had only a thermal reaction but normal in its behaviour and feeding and a severe one, by high temperature, loss of appetite, dullness, sluggish movement, congested mucous membranes conjunctivitis, etc. A thermal reaction means a rise in the temperature as compared to the normal temperature under similar conditions. (A) GOATS It is well known that the goats used for the production of goatis show severe reaction on in- oculation of the goat virus. It is also believed that if they are allowed to live, they succumb to the disease, or, in cases of recovery, they remain emaciated [Saunders, 1936]. A series of experiments were performed to produce immunity in sheep and goats by use of goatis alone or its following modifications. (1) serum and goatis mixed for half an hour, (2) goatis followed by a dose of serum 24 hours later, (3) goatis immediately followed by serum. The goatis in all the experiments was obtained from the Punjab Veterinary College, per messenger and efforts were always made to use it immediately after its receipt. In any case it was kept in ice till required for use. The number of the virus (i.e. the number of the goat at the Punjab Veterinary College, from which the goat virus was procured) and the date of arrival and despatch were noted in all the experiments. The serum used was the 'ordinary' serum obtained from the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute.

LALL 13 Goatis produced a very severe reaction in all the goats except Nos. 950, 84 and 104 which had reacted mildly in the previous experiment. Two goats (Nos. 49, 998) which were inoculated with mixed serum and goatis in the previous experiment exhibited a severe reaction thus indicating that serum and goatis mixed had no immunizing value. Goat Nos. 603 and 998 died showing lesions of rinder- pest. It appears from these observations that goatis need not necessarily cause mortality in all the injected goats and that it produces a different type of reaction in individual animals. Blood virus did not produce a reaction in any way different from that produced by goatis. Four animals reacted on the fourth day, three on the fifth day and one (No. 9) without having any thermal reaction remained very dull for a considerable period, thus proving that the temperature was not the only criterion of the severity of the reaction. From this experiment it became clear that: (i) Goatis by itself was of no use because of the severe reaction produced by it, and (ii) serum and goatis mixed were also useless as their inoculation failed to produce any reaction.

The observations further reveal that serum and goatis given at the same time produce a mild reaction in Betal goats and in virtue of this some immunity is likely to be produced.

Goat Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were injected with goatis followed by 5 c.c. of serum; goat Nos. 4, 5 and 6 got goatis followed by 7 c.c. of serum, while goat Nos. 7 and 8 were kept as controls.

Hill goat No. 155, which had mildly reacted on vaccination did not evince any thermal reaction. It will thus be observed that the Betals and the hill goats behave in a similar fashion to inoculation of serum and goatis and develop a similar degree of immunity. Here it may be mentioned that the bull virus did not produce a very severe reaction (only a thermal reaction), either in bovines or goats or sheep at Hissar. The observations in this connection made elsewhere (see section under sheep) also show that the bull virus produces a reaction milder to that of goatis in sheep and goat. Nicolle and Adilbey [1902] and Walker [1922] also noticed only thermal reaction in sheep on inoculation of bovine blood virus. The reaction in the cattle of Hissar breed is also milder [Report of the Disease Investigation Officer, Punjab, 1944-45] as compared to the reaction described from other parts of India which is probably due to the climatic conditions or the natural resistance of Hissar breed.

Positive reaction (two died of rinderpest) Field trial Rinderpest was prevalent in the Kangra and Kulu valleys of the Punjab, which are areas of high rainfall and cool climate, because of the high altitude. There a stock of 600 Himalayan Gaddi goats was immunized by the serum-goatis method, 0.01 gm. of goatis and 15 c.c. serum ; a few of the goats were not inoculated so that they might serve as controls. It was possible to keep regular temperature charts in the case of 10 animals only eight vaccinated and two controls. The controls died of the disease while the vaccinated ones survived the outbreak, thus confirming the results obtained at Hissar farm, namely that a combination of serum and goatis can be safely employed to produce immunity in goats against rinderpest. (B) SHEEP The experiments carried out on goats were repeated on Lohi, Hissari, Merino-Bikaneri crosses Bikaneri and desi sheep at the same time. Some variations in the reaction were observed in the different breeds. Goatis by itself was used as the immunizing agent in all breeds except the Lohi, in which because of the great susceptibility of sheep of that breed serum was used with the goatis
H. K. LALL 17 Experiment No. 1 Three Lohi (497, 513, 712), five Hissari (149, 888, 893, 706, 915) and five Bikaneri (523, 511, 592, 591, 515) sheep were inoculated with 0.01 gm. of goatis ; while two Lohis (No. 661, 521) were given a dose of serum along with goatis as a precautionary measure. The reaction in Lohi, except for the two which received serum and goatis mixture, was more marked than the one observed in other two breeds. In the Hissari sheep the reaction was milder than that of the Bikaneri and Lohi, four out of five animals reacted. Among the Bikaneri sheep the reaction was no different in those that got serum than in the others that did not get it. As the virus was attenuated, due to break- down of the refrigerator, no definite conclusion could be arrived at. Most of the animals reacted on the sixth day and the reaction lasted for three or four days ; in two animals it continued for about a week. Experiment No. 2 As the goatis had been attenuated in the first experiment, six Bikaneri, two Lohi and two Hissari were given fresh goatis to observe the difference in the breed reaction if any. All the animals reacted on the fifth or sixth day. In all the animals the reaction subsided in a few days except in one in which it lasted for more than a week. None of these animals was dull. This showed that goatis could be used in these breeds as immunizing agents without any fear of severe reaction. Experiment No. 3 Fifteen animals of Hissari, Lohi and Bikaneri breeds were inoculated with goatis to confirm the findings of the above experiment. Hissari. Of these, eight reacted while seven (46.6 per cent) did not. The reaction was observed on the fourth day. In three animals the reaction lasted for one day (the day of reaction only), in three for two days and in two for more than three days. The duration of the reaction cannot be definitely stated, as the temperature was not taken up to the termination of the period because the animals were feeding normally. Only one was seen slightly dull. One of the non-reactors (808), when being transported from the experimental yard to its pen, suddenly died on the way. On autopsy haemorrhages in the duodenum, ulcers in the intestine and an inflamed ileum were discovered. Parasitic nodules were also found in the intestine. On opening the buccal cavity, it was noticed that a clump of green bersseem which the animal had been chewing before commencing its journey was acting as an obstruction in the larynx; this probably led to aysphxia. The presence of enteritis and ulceration typical of rinderpest is rather interesting, because the animal was a non-reactor. It suggested that probably other animals had the disease but were naturally so resistant that they did not die or show any thermal reaction. This accident revealed something as to what was happening inside the body of the sheep. Bikaneri.

They were dull and off feed and seven of them had severe diarrhoea. Five of these were given serum and two left as controls, but all recovered at the same time, indicating that serum, given after the reaction had set in, was not of much use It may be mentioned here that the degree of dullness and partial loss of appetite did not, in many cases, correspond with the duration of the thermal reaction. This observation is similar to
18 Immunization of Sheep and Goats Against Rinderpest what was observed in goats. In some animals, the thermal reaction lasted for a day but they re- mained dull for a long time. Dullness was usually observed two or three days after the thermal reaction when the animals stopped grazing. It was also found that goatis vaccinated sheep kept in better condition with grazing then with stall feeding during the period of observation. Experiment No. 4 To confirm the above findings concerning the variation in the reaction of the different breeds of sheep, 10 more animals of each of the breeds mentioned above and eight desi sheep were inoculated with goatis. Lohi lambs were also included in the experiment to compare their susceptibility with that of the adults. For the sake of comparison, five of these were given serum goatis and five goatis alone. Hissari. In this lot one animal did not react. Five animals reacted on the third day, Two animals reacted on the fourth day, One animal reacted on the second day, and One animal reacted on the first day, i.e., one day after inoculation. None of these animals stopped grazing for any length of time. The only sign of dullness was the fact that the animals did not feed on the day of reaction and a day after. The duration of the reaction was longer in this batch than in the previous one. One animal died with haemorrhages in the abomasum, enteritis, pneumonia of the anterior and middle lobes of both lungs and congestion of the larynx, thus indicating that the reaction in Hissari may not always be as mild as was indicated by the previous experiment. Bikaneri. None of the animals had diarrhoea or were dull in spite of the longer duration of the thermal reaction as compared to its duration in the previous experiment. One animal reacted on the first day, Two animals reacted on the second day, and Seven animals reacted on the third day. Adult Lohi. Four sheep were injected with goatis while the other group of five got 15 c.c. serum and goatis. All were found to be more susceptible than the Bikaneris and Hissaris as observed previous- ly. Most of the animals reacted on the second day and the reaction lasted for more than a week. In the animals which got serum, the reaction was comparatively mild, though it started in most of them on the third day and lasted for more than a week. Lohi lambs. Two of these died without showing any lesions of rinderpest. The others reacted severely, demonstrating that the lambs were more susceptible than the adults. The dose of serum given did not seem to reduce the severity of the reaction, thus showing that a higher dose was required in young lambs. Desi. These were found to be more resistant than the others because during the reaction they were quite active and fed normally. One died without showing any lesion of rinderpest. One did not react, while the remainder reacted on the second day, the reaction lasting from 3 to 10 days. The old animals exhibited the same degree of reaction as the young ones thus indicating that no immunity is conferred with age. FIELD TRIAL At the time when goatis was being tried in goats at Kangra, it was also used in sheep. It was observed that Biangi sheep were comparatively more susceptible than the Gaddi and other mixed bred local sheep. Haddow [1939] on the other hand, has stated that sheep from Tibet and Himalayan hinterland are not susceptible. Of the Biangis, 150 were given goatis and serum while 44 were given goatis alone. None died but the thermal reaction was severe in the controls, while in the others the reaction was mild. Regular temperature charts were kept in the case of ten animals in each group; three of the ten animals which got goatis and serum (10 c.c.) did not react (probably examples of blocked reaction). The temperature record was maintained in ten Gaddi sheep also and individual
H. K. LALL 19 observations made. Out of these ten animals, two did not react. The day and the duration of reactions are as stated below: Six reacted on the fourth day, One reacted on the fifth day, and One reacted on the sixth day. One animal on the two days, Two animals on the six days, and One animal on the eight days. There was a slight loss of condition amongst the reactors, but otherwise the results were satis- factory. In one lamb there were symptoms of haemoglobinuria. Blood smears were sent to the Punjab Veterinary College and piroplasma were found, but these could not be discovered in another smear sent to Hissar. From the results of this field trial it can be confidently assumed that goatis can safely be used in Gaddi as well as Biangi sheep for the purpose of producing active immuniza- tion against rinderpest. In the case of Biangi sheep if a high thermal reaction, which causes no mortality, is to be avoided, serum may be given in addition as in the case of goats. IMMUNITY TEST IN SHEEP The immunity of the sheep which were immunized with goatis was tested with bull virus. Seven Lohis, six Hissaris and 11 Bikaneris were used. Five Lohis and five Hissaris were kept as controls. Three buffalo calves used as controls in the case of goats automatically became controls in this ex- periment. (i) Lohi. It was found that Lohis which had reacted to goatis did not react to bull virus after an interval of three months. Nos. 661 and 521 which had been given serum and had reacted mildly got a mild and passing reaction. One sheep died of pneumonia. The controls with the exception of one had high thermal reaction but did not exhibit dullness or loss of appetite. The severity of the reaction exhibited in the case of bull virus was less than in the case of goatis. The results are tabulated in Table VII.

LALL 21 Second batch: Dose per animal22 Immunization of Sheep and Goats Against Rinderpest Sixth batch: Dose per animalAN ESTIMATE OF THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF MILCH AND OTHER CATTLE IN INDIA AND SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW PRESENT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE CAN BE ADJUSTED TO PROVIDE THEM* By GRAHAME WILLIAMSON, Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India helped by K. P. R. KARTHA AND RAM SWARUP, Animal Husbandry Bureau, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research (Received for publication on 14 May 1946) THE available statistics concerning cultivated crops, although they are admittedly inaccurate, do provide a reasonable working basis upon which to make an estimate of the fodder derived from these crops but in computing the part which the uncultivated sources of annual food play and which, after all, is the real mainstay of the live-stock of the country, only a few vague indications may be gathered from published figures. Previous authors have used these in different ways and it is only a matter of opinion as to how close or how wide they have come to actuals. The figures arrived at in this note, like those previously computed, are not absolute but can be taken only as an approximate indication of the most probable requirements and deficiencies. Only British India has been considered. The following cattle population has to be fed:24 Food Requirements of milch and other Cattle in India TABLE I The starch equivalent and digestible protein required Total requirements in million tons per annum S.E.

Production requirements for 28 million tons of milk . . . . . 8.85 1.43 Maintenance of 14 million buffaloes (average live weight 1,000 lb.) . . 13.80 1.38 Maintenance of 49.3 million working bullocks and bulls (average weight 600 lb.) 19.79 1.64 Requirements for work (medium work 4 hours daily at 4.1 lb.

The nature of the foods which could provide that, the amounts available and the extent of the deficiency is stated in Table II. TABLE II Food necessary to provide the required proportion of D. P. and S. E. G. WILLIAMSON, ET AL. 25 there will be a 50 per cent increase in the yield from land in 10 to 15 years time. As that target is attained it will be possible to produce 13 per cent increase in the present quantity of cereals on 131 acres, releasing 43 million acres which may be devoted, as suggested below, towards making up defi- ciencies in human and livestock requirements. As stated above the production of oils and fats needs to be increased 330 per cent in order to provide food for human beings. At the increased rate of yield, the 15.5 million acres now used must be increased to 34 million acres and thus 18.5 million acres more have to be used for that crop. At present 2.5 million tons of edible oil cakes are produced. When the area and yield are increased, 8.25 million tons will be available. Adding the uncrushed cotton seed which is fed at present, that is 0.94 million tons, the total of cakes and seed will amount to 9.2 million tons. No increase in the acreage under cotton seed is envisaged. To augment the supplies of concentrated food it is suggested that the present acreage under gram and barley, which are good cattle feeds, may be increased as much as possible or crops of equivalent value where gram and barley cannot be grown. Six million acres are, however, required for the cultivation of green fodder; the remaining 18.5 million acres can be devoted to the cultivation of gram and cereals for cattle. On that acreage, 4.5 and 5.32 million tons respectively can be raised. The six million acres which may be allotted to green fodder crops along with the 10.5 million acres at present used should provide, on the increased yield scale, the amount required. More nutrients can be made avilable from this land if leguminous fodder like lucerne and berseem are grown but, assuming that the present proportion between the various fodders persists, the 50 per cent increase of the present out put of 7.5 tons per acre on 16.5 million acres will produce 185.6 million tons at 11.25 tons per acre. Straw will remain practically the same as at present. The food provided when the above change is introduced in the cropping programme, will be as indicated in Table III.

There are 136 million acres of grazing land in British India. No precise data are available as to how much grass this land produces. The limited information we have goes to show that the production of grass is about two tons green per acre. A third of this can be made into hay or silage, D.
26 Food Requirements of Milch and other Cattle in India. giving the equivalent of 90 million tons of green grass. Assuming the grass to have the value of 6.2 per cent S. E. containing 1.33 D. P., it will provide 5.6 million tons of S. E. with 1.2 million tons of D. P. This still leaves a deficiency of 6.34 million tons of S. E. and 3.68 million tons of D. P. That can be met from concentrated protein food of animal origin of which fish meal should supply a large proportion. It is recognised that while the ultimate objective must be the provision of food which will allow the cattle of this country to maintain health and to produce on the most paying basis, it is necessary in practice to concentrate on intermediate goals which can be progressively raised as agricultural conditions improve. These intermediate goals must differ from region to region according to markets, agricultural practices, prejudices, etc.; the exact goals are, therefore, a matter of individual adminis- trations to determine. It is improbable that administrative units can become self-sufficient; inter-adjustment in the supply of protein concentrates must continue. That class of foodstuffs being relatively non-bulky is transportable and thus the difficulty is not insoluble. Table IV illustrates the present position in regard to them.

As a first stage towards the ultimate aim, attention should be given to the produc- tion of what is now recognised to be the primary human food requirement from cattle as expressed by the Nutrition Advisory Committee of the Indian Research Fund Association (1944) and the Agricul- tural Policy Committee No. 5 (Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries), that is, the production of more milk and the work entailed in cultivating the land. As far as the latter need is concerned, it must be admitted that what bullocks there are do in fact cultivate the present acreage although on their low nutrient level they do not do so in an economical manner but, for the immediate present, the standard as it is must be accepted. Such, however, need not be the case in regard to increased milk production for it has been abun- dantly proved that immediate returns are to be had from better feeding. If these returns are to be maintained and increased, attention must be paid to the development of the rising and future genera- tions of cows. As an immediate object then, the requirements may be expressed as the produc- tion of food for 8.1 million tons of milk per annum, i.e., 50 per cent more than the present supply and for the growth of heifers. The food required is extra to that now grown and it must be produced largely from concentrates because (1) the maintenance requirements of the cows and buffaloes and the present supply of milk is mainly derived from the bulky uncultivated food; (2) a milk production ration necessitates a high proportion of proteins; and (3) the milk is required for heavily populated areas and if it is to be delivered there in the fluid state, it must be produced in or near these areas; such areas have few grazing facilities and so, for the most part, the milch animals and special young stock must be stall fed. A certain amount of green fodder must be provided because there is a lack of it in the present ration. The requirements, as far as milk is concerned, may, therefore, be stated as 2.56 million tons of S. E. and 0.47 million tons of D. P. with a nutritive ratio of 1:6.
G. WILLIAMSON, ET AL. 27 The following feeding stuffs (Table V) fed approximately in the proportion stated below, will provide that: TABLE V Extra feed required for milk Average per cent of S.E.

28 Food Requirements of Milch and other Cattle in India. land are of primary consideration. After human needs in cereals are met, 17 million acres of land will be released from these crops and simultaneously the production of cereal by-products will be increased by 0.13 million tons. By the same practice, 0.62 million acres will be released from pulse production. On the other hand, 12.4 million extra acres will be needed for oil crops if the target is to provide for even half of the present human deficiency, but it will provide 3.1 million tons of extra oilcakes. The immediate need of 10.22 million tons of green fodder should be covered in a 25 per cent increase in yield of the present acreage. The position then would be, in relation to the limited target set, that there is a surplus of 2.27 million tons of oilcake and a deficiency of 1.18 million tons of gram and pulses and 1.21 million tons of cereal by-products, while there is 5.22 million acres of land available for further use. It should be employed for the production of either gram, pulses or cereals which will approximately meet the balance of requirements.
AN ESTIMATE OF THE FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF MILCH AND OTHER CATTLE IN INDIA* By L. C. SIKKA, Assistant Director of Agriculture (Livestock), Bengal (Received for publication on 14 May 1946) THE Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research has issued a plan for the development of Indian Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. In order to achieve national suffi- ciency in human foodstuffs (for a population of 400 millions), in that plan, the minimum targets laid down are to increase the existing production of cereals by 10 per cent, pulses by 20 per cent, fats and oils by 250 per cent, fruits by 50 per cent, vegetables by 100 per cent, milk by 300 per cent and fish and eggs by 300 per cent. Furthermore, with a view to provide adequate supplies of animal foods neces- sary for the increased outturn of work and milk, it has been stated that the present production of oil cakes and other concentrates (estimated at 3.75 million tons) must be increased by 400 per cent and of roughages (estimated production 175 million tons) by 55 per cent. This note has been written (a) to show the approximate requirements of our bovine population in the light of that plan, and (b) to broadly indicate the adjustments, which may be made in the existing agricultural practice, in order to provide these requirements. FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF THE INDIAN BOVINE STOCK Estimates have to be formulated of requirements for (a) milk production, (b) work, and (c) growth of the bovine stock required to attain the foregoing targets. To be accurate such estimates must be based on the actual requirements of different nutrients (digestible protein, starch equivalent, etc.) for each purpose, a point overlooked, in most cases, in the past [Burns, 1944]. It should be obvious that because of the great variations in the quality and, therefore, requirements of animals in different parts of India, the all-India estimate of requirements ought to be a composite of regional estimates. Unfortunately, however, it is not possible to prepare regional estimates with any measure of accuracy. This is because, firstly, it is not easy to judge correctly the number of work and milch animals and youngstock that will be required in each region to supply its requirements, since that must depend upon the improvement which may be effected through better feeding, improved management, proper breeding, and disease control in the existing stocks of each region; and secondly our knowledge regarding the optimum food requirements of different types of cattle of each region is extremely imperfect. It is essential that immediate steps be taken to obtain this information, so that the regional estimates can be prepared accurately. Without that no definite planning can be possible. An all-India estimate, based on average estimated requirements for all regions, must, therefore, be of somewhat academic interest. However, it should serve as a first approximation in indicating the total requirements for the country, and thereby showing the lee-way we will have to make up to provide these requirements. It is, therefore, given here for what it is worth. Because of the paucity of the required data only an estimate for the British India is presented in this note. The total quantity of milk required in British India may be taken at 44 million tons. Assuming that the existing annual production per animal is 750 lb., which may be increased by 60 per cent [Burns, 1944] through improved feeding, management and disease control (thus giving an annual yield of 1200 lb. per animal), some 82.3 million milch cattle will be required to produce the required quantity of milk. Taking into account the milk production by goats, the foregoing number of milch cattle may be reduced to 81 millions, compared with the existing number of 54 millions (Agricultural * Presented before the Crops and Soils Wing meeting held on December 1945, at Delhi. 29
30 Food Requirements of Milch and other Cattle in India. Statistics of India, 1935-36). Assuming the average live weight per head to be 600 lb. the nutrients required for these animals willl be: Digestible protein in tons Starch equivalent in tons. For maintenance (0.5 lb. digestible protein and 5.0 lb. starch equivalent per 1,000 lb. live-weight) . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,959,600 39,696,000 For production (0.6 lb. digestible protein and 3.0 lb. starch equivalent per gallon, . 2,644,000 13,200,000 Total . 6,603,600 52,816,000 It is significant to point out that the foregoing requirements for milk production can be reduced if the average milk production per animal can be improved by more than 60 per cent. This is because, in that case, a smaller number of animals will be required to produce the total quantity of milk required, which, in turn, will lead to a reduction in the nutrients required for their maintenance. This should indicate the great need of improving the production of our stock by breeding since the scope of improvement by better feeding and management, although large at present, is strictly limited by their hereditary make-up. According to the Agricultural Statistics of India, 1935-36, the total number of bulls and bullocks in British India is 57.2 millions. Ware [1944] Ibid has estimated that the number of existing bullocks can be reduced by 15.2 millions as a result of improving their efficiency by 60 per cent (in the more backward areas only) through better feeding, management and disease control. This, if accepted, would leave 42 million bulls and bullocks to be fed. Taking their average live-weight at 600 lb. per head, their production requirements at 0.5 lb. digestible protein and 2.5 lb. starch equivalent per day, and the average working period at 4 months per annum their requirements will be: L. C. SIKKA 31 AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF ANIMAL FOOD Crop residues (straw and stover of cereals and pulses), grasses and weeds, grazed or collected from grazing lands, waste lands and cultivated lands, specially grown fodder crops, by-products of the oil and milling industries, and a certain amount of seeds, comprise the food of our cattle. It is not possible to formulate an exact estimate of the supplies of each, as the basic data required for this pur- pose is wanting. Any attempt in this direction must, therefore, naturally be in the nature of a guess estimate. This must be borne in mind in considering the figures which follow. Ware [1944] has estimated that the existing supply of animal food consists of 19.53 million tons of special fodder crops, 67.74 million tons of grasses, 87.2 million tons of straws of food grains, and 3.729 million tons of concentrates (cakes, seeds, bran and pollard). Details have, however, not been furnished how these estimates were arrived at. It would appear, the estimate for concentrates is rather low, provided all the available supplies of oil-cakes are made available for the feeding of livestock, which, of course, is not so at present, as substantial quantities are used as manure. Burn- [1944] has estimated the production of oil-cakes alone to be three million tons. When to this are added the quantities of cotton seed, wheat bran, rice bran and pulse husks which can be available for the feeding of cattle, the total quantity of concentrates must considerably exceed Ware's estimate. Our estimate of the total quantity of animal food produced (not the quantity that is actually fed to cattle) in British India, and the nutrients supplied by it, is as follows: Total production (dry weight) in Million tons Digestible protein in tons Starch equivalent in tons Roughages: Fodder crops . . . . . . . . . . 19.53 976,000 7,812,000 Grasses . . . . . . . . . . 67.74 3,387,000 27,096,000 Straws . . . . . . . . . . 87.20 436,000 21,800,000 Total . 174.47 4,799,000 56,708,000 Concentrates: Oil cakes (excluding castor) . . . . . . 3.00 961,000 2,076,000 Brans . . . . . . 1.40 122,000 714,000 Pulse husks and chuni . . . . . . 1.37 65,000 709,000 Cotton seed . . . . . . . . 1.40 157,500 1,078,000 Total . 7.17 1,305,500 4,577,000 Grand Total . 181.64 6,104,500 61,285,000 Compared with the total requirements, the available supplies of digestible protein and starch equivalent are 42.7 per cent and 56.5 per cent respectively. ADJUSTMENTS RECOMMENDED TO MEET THE DEFICIT It should be obvious that there cannot be a uniform set of adjustments for the whole of India. These must vary from area to area in accordance with the requirements of each, and its agricultural conditions. Furthermore, it is unlikely that each area will prove capable of being made self sufficient, although like the deficit areas, there are bound to be surplus areas as well. The surplus produce of the latter should be available for supplementing the produce of the former. For want of the requisite information, it is not possible to treat the subject on a regional basis. Only all-India adjustments are, therefore, indicated in what follows. But steps must be taken to secure the required information for each region and sub-region, and detailed plans prepared on the basis of such information to secure a regional self-sufficiency as far as possible. It is well known that the same land cropped with cereals and pulses can support a much larger population than if devoted to stock keeping. Agriculturally over populated as India is, with its small
32 Food Requirements of Milch and other Cattle in India. holdings, the land must needs be cropped essentially to produce human food of plant origin. The production of animal food must remain largely subservient to that system, only surplus land being devoted to the keeping of livestock, that in the absence of land, must subsist on the by-products of human food. As already stated, in order to attain self-sufficiency in human foodstuffs, the targets fixed are to increase the production of cereals by 10 per cent, of pulses by 20 per cent and of fats and oils (and, therefore, of oil seeds) by 250 per cent. That, when done, should also enhance the existing supplies of straw by some 15 per cent, bran by 10 per cent, pulse husks and chuni by 20 per cent, and oil-cakes by 250 per cent, thus giving us the following quantities of nutrients: Total production (dry weight in million tons) Digestible protein in tons Starch equivalent in tons Roughages: Fodder crops . . . . . . . . . 19.53 976,000 7,812,000 Grasses . . . . . . . . . . 67.74 3,387,000 27,096,000 Straws . . . . . . . . . . 100.28 501,400 25,070,000 Total . 187.55 4,864,400 59,978,000 Concentrates: Oilcakes (excluding castor) . . . . . . . . . 7.50 2,402,500 5,190,000 Brans . . . . . . . . . . 1.84 134,200 785,400 Pulse, husks and chuni . . . . . . . . . 1.55 78,000 850,800 Cotton seed . . . . . . . . . 1.40 157,500 1,078,000 Total . 11.99 2,772,200 7,904,200 Grand Total . 199.54 7,336,600 67,882,200 Compared with the total requirements, the supplies of digestible protein and starch equivalent, which will thus become available, are 53.4 per cent and 62.6 per cent respectively. It must first be considered how this projected increased production of human food (and, therefore, of animal food) may be effected: whether by extending the area under these crops, or by obtaining higher yields per acre, or by a combination of both these steps. Burns [1944]. Ibid has already indicated the technological possibilities of crop improvement in India. He has shown that by adopting improved agricultural practices it is possible to improve the yield of cereals by 20-50 per cent, of grain by 20 per cent, and of most oilseeds by 15-25 per cent. In view of these results, the desired increased production of cereals and pulses should be obtainable from the existing areas under such crops; while in case of oilseeds their present area (18.5 million acres) must be at least doubled. However, in view of the great possibility for increasing the yield of cereals, and their large area (156 million acres), there should be ample scope for finding the additional land required for growing oilseeds out of that area. It should also be stated that the use of edible oil-cakes as manures must be discontinued. Burns [1944] Ibid has estimated that, in order to meet only one-fifth the manurial needs of paddy (to secure increased yield per acre), the whole of the existing supply of oilcakes is required. If the use of edible oilcakes as manure is to increase, the animal food supply position may further deteriorate. No doubt, without the use of manures the scope for increasing the yield of our crops is, in most cases, very little; but artificial fertilizers, farm yard manure, compost and green manures, rather than edible oilcakes, must be looked upon to satisfy that need. It is also essential to stop the export of oilseeds and oilcakes, and develop the Indian oilseeds crushing industry.
L. C. SIKKA 33 In spite of the foregoing increased production, there will still remain a deficit of some 6.66 million tons of digestible protein and 40.50 million tons of starch equivalent. How may that be met ? Obviously, the first thing to do would be to increase the supplies from the existing sources, as much as possible, and then look for new sources. The waste lands, aggregating some 90 million acres in British India, offer a great scope in this respect. These should be surveyed, and working plans formulated for their development. Such waste lands, as can be brought under cultivation economi- cally should be used for that purpose, if possible, for growing fodder crops; while the grass produc- tion from the rest should be increased by suitable management. That there is a very great scope in the latter direction, there can be no doubt. We have already the example of improvement of usar lands in the United Provinces*, the hay production of which was increased from 2.75 maunds to 15.0 maunds per acre over a period of 5½ years by the simple and inexpensive practice of protecting them from grazing during the six rainy months, in spite of grazing having been permitted after the hay harvest. If each acre of waste land, suitably managed, were to yield annually even half a ton (dry weight) of hay more than at present (surely, not an impossible target), the extra quantity of grazing material thus obtained would provide nearly 2¼ million tons of digestible protein and 18 million tons of starch equivalent. In order to produce the balanceA SURVEY OF THE FEEDS AND FODDERS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIVESTOCK IN THE UNITED PROVINCES* By N. C. DAS GUPTA, Research Officer, Cattle Feeding Research Station, Bharari, Jhansi (Received for publication on 14 May 1946) THE products of the field which are inedible for man are the main source of nutrients for the livestock but, farm animals cannot produce milk, meat or labour efficiently unless some edible food is also included in the ration. In addition to the mill by-products, a large amount of grains are required for this purpose. Hence, to study the position of feeds for the livestock of a country it is necessary to find out the amount of food which can be spared after meeting the requirements of the human population. FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR HUMAN POPULATION According to the census report of 1941 there are 29,542,474 male and 26,803,981 female in the United Provinces and the approximate amount of nutrients necessary per year is shown in Table I.

For a mixed population of men, women and children the requirement is expected to be lower but, as the extra nutrients required for heavy work, pregnancy and nursing have not been taken into account, it is advisable to assume the figures arrived at as what is required to support the total popula- tion of the province. Nutrients available for human consumption. The acreage under different crops [Season and Crop Report of the United Provinces for the year 1942-43] and their present estimated yield [Pugh and Dutt, 1940] have been taken into account to arrive at the total food produced. In some cases the figures had to be assumed in the absence of statistical averages. For example, nutrients of the item 'other food crops' have been calculated from the average figure of the pulses. Similarly, the figure for the fruits and vegetables is based on the everage of all the common vegetables. Thus they provide only an approximate return. Health Bulletin No. 23 has been followed for the food values. *Presented before the Crop and Soils Wing Meeting held in December, 1945, at Delhi. 34

C. DAS GUPTA 41 From Table VIII it is observed that amongst the food crops maize gives the best return, net energy per acre being 1,19.4 therms. Wheat, barley and rice come next in order. But all the main fodder crops provide at least twice the amount of net energy than maize as a grain crop. The return of protein is also much higher from fodder crops. An acre of lucerne provides the maximum nutrients but it occupies the land throughout the year. The rotation berseem and chari or bajra comes next followed in order by the rotations oats and guar, soyabean or maize, and senji and jowar, maize or bajra. With the above considerations it is possible to produce from the extra 10 million acres which is approximately equivalent to net 6.39 million acres when double cropping is taken into account, the amount of nutrients as given in Table IX in excess if fodder crops are raised.

But, 15,626 thousand tons of dry matter and 24,637,287 thousand therms remain still to be provided. Since grains supply more energy weight for weight, it usually becomes necessary to include grains in the ration to meet the energy requirement within the limited capacity of dry matter intake. Hence, either the area under cultivation should be increased by utilizing the culturable waste or the yield improved for providing more grains for balancing the energy. In certain localities it may not always be possible to increase the area under cultivation and in others it may be undesirable, as it would either reduce the grazing land or increase soil erosion. On the otherhand, in view of the present poor yield, it appears to be more feasible to increase the yield. Additional production can also release more area for raising fodders if necessary. In case it is possible to increase the yield by 50 per cent, 2,429.6 thousand tons of protein and 85,956,825 thousand therms fuel can be made available, with the present cropping arrangement. After providing for the human population the excess nutrients can provide 9,495 thousand tons dry matter, 1,061.0 thousand tons digestible protein and 18,850,000 thousand therms net energy for feeding livestock. The balance of nutrients is shown in Table X. F

This indicates that some feed or a crop which can provide the required amount of digestible protein and energy within 13.5 million tons of dry matter is needed to balance the requirement. Grains like barley bajra and maize contain the nutrients approximately in the proportion required. But, even with the increased rate of yield more than 24 million acres of extra area will have to be cultivated to provide 13.5 million tons of dry grains. On the otherhand, the shortage can nearly be made up if 8 million acres of the present rabi area can be sown with berseem even when allowance is made for the nutrients from the corresponding rabi crops as shown in Table XI. Where facilities are available, this area can easily be spared for berseem. With 50 per cent increase in yield, the need of the human population can be met from 25.0 million acres out of the total 44.5 million acres leaving 19.5 million acres for raising feeds or fodders according to the requirements. The yield per acre of rabi food crop has been taken as 1,621 lb. dry matter 73.3 lb. of digestible protein and 709 therms net energy, the average of wheat, barley, gram and 'other food crops' for arriving at the net extra return from berseem crop.

C. DAS GUPTA 43 Another important factor also requires attention. The excessive amount of nutrients necessary can be reduced without impairing the production with better efficiency of animals. Table III shows that the digestible protein and energy requirement of milch cows and buffaloes for maintenance alone are 4.8 and 6.6 times more than what is required for production of milk. The amount of digestible protein and net energy for maintenance are 755.0 thousand tons and 16,753,800 thousand therms respectively as compared to 158.2 thousand tons and 2,554,000 thousand therms for production. With higher rate of milk yield the number of animals can be reduced for the same amount of production, thereby reducing the maintenance requirement to a great extent. With better efficiency more bullock power can also be obtained with less number of bullocks. This point has already been discussed by Das Gupta [1945]. SUMMARY It is estimated that out of 1,619.7 thousand tons of protein and 57,304,550 thousand therms fuel available from food grains, seeds and milk, about 1,219.3 thousand tons of protein and 48,370,000 thousand therms fuel are required per year for 56 million human population of the province. The balance which is equivalent to 2,257 thousand tons dry matter, 252.3 thousand tons digestible protein and 4,481,960 thousand therms net energy, can be spared for the livestock. The total requirement for maintenance, growth, production of milk or work for 30,208,247 livestock, excluding sheep, goats and swine, is 74,294 thousand tons of dry matter, 3,489.6 thousand tons digestible protein and 69,128,997 thousand therms net energy per year. The present total yield of 3,047 thousand tons of milk can provide, on an average, 5.3 oz. per head per day. If the consumption is to be increased to 8.0 oz. about 1,554 thousand tons more milk will have to be produced and the total requirement for livestock will increase to 3,569.9 thousand tons digestible protein and 70,411,997 therms net energy. The amount of nutrients available for feeding livestock is 36,596 thousand tons dry matter, 813.6 thousand tons digestible protein and 23,880,890 thousand therms net energy which is only 49, 23, and 34 per cent respectively of the requirement. Fodder crops provide nearly twice as much net energy as grain crops per acre. Though 4.8 times more protein and 2.9 times fuel is necessary for 30 million livestock than what is required for 56 million human population, only 3.6 per cent of the total cropped area is under fodder. With the present condition of poor yield, it is not possible to meet the requirement even if the total area corresponding to the excess of grains after providing for human population is put under the best fodder crops. The shortage can be met if the yield can be increased by 50 per cent and about one-fifth of the total area is put under fodder crops, mainly legumes.

CATTLE FOOD POSITION IN DELHI PROVINCE By RAM SWARUP, I. D. D., Assoc I. D. I., Officer-in-Charge, Animal Husbandry Bureau, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research (Received for publication on 14 May 1946) IN this note an attempt has been made to estimate and compare the amount of animal feed produced in Delhi* with the amount needed to put the livestock in the optimum nutritional condition for full production. The computation has been based on assumptions which appear to be, and probably are, reason- able but might nevertheless be erroneous and on data of present production and animal population which are not unquestionable. The note has been prepared more with a view to demonstrate the method which might be employed for making similar estimates rather than to propound an estab- lished fact. It is found that the cattle feed production in Delhi province and the amounts actually required to insure proper feeding are as indicated in Table I.

M. PAUL and M. C. RANGASAMY, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 25 October 1945) SUGARCANE is very extensively cultivated in India, the estimated land under sugarcane for 1944-45 being 4,134,000 acres. The yield of sugarcane varies from province to province, but the average yield of millable cane is estimated to be about 20 tons per acre. The yield of sugarcane tops available in India is roughly 22 per cent of the millable cane which amounts to a little over four tons per acre. This amounts to 16,536,000 tons, and is likely to be on the increase. Thus very large amounts of sugarcane tops are produced in the sugarcane tracts during the sugarcane milling season. A comparatively negligible portion of it, is being utilized as fodder for cattle while the rest of it is allowed to wither and dry on the field and subsequently utilized as fuel for feeding the furnaces during the concentration of the sugarcane juice or simply burnt off on the fields. Thus it is clear, that a very large proportion of the sugarcane tops produced in India is allowed to go to waste. If some profitable means of utilizing this is found, that will certainly add to the income of the sugar- cane cultivator. According to 'Morrison Sugarcane tops make satisfactory forage for livestock' and our own experience is that cattle relish them when they are fresh, but when they are wilted and a bit dry, cattle do not relish them much, possibly due to the coarse nature of sugarcane tops and leaves. Again due to the local and seasonal concentration in the production of sugarcane tops, one cannot expect that any considerable portion of it will be utilized as cattle feed in the fresh state. Therefore some suitable method of preserving the sugarcane tops with or without processing has to be evolved, if all the sugar tops is to be utilized as fodder. By making silage perhaps, its, fodder qualities may improve and the cattle may relish it just like any other roughage. Moreover silage making is a method of preservation of fodder for seasons of fodder shortage. Thus, if silage could be successfully made out of sugarcane tops and if cattle could be fed on it safely, it may go a great way to relieve the fodder shortage in the country and thus contribute to the solution of the milk- problem to a certain extent. Both in America and Japan, sugarcane as well as sugarcane tops and bagasse have been successfully fed to cattle as silage and otherwise. But so far no data is available as to the suitability of the sugarcane tops for silage making under the Indian conditions and how far the indigenous breeds of cattle will relish it as fodder. Therefore an attempt was made at the Imperial Dairy Research Institute to study this problem. EXPERIMENTAL Sugarcane tops were procured locally in as fresh a condition as possible. Daily about a ton of the material was brought and cut into 1/3 to ½ inch bits in a chaffing machine and filled into five ft. cube silage pits dug in the ground. On the first day the sugarcane tops were filled into silo No. I without the addition of any thing else, second day's sample was filled into silo No. II with the addition of molasses at the rate of 40 lb. per ton diluted with an equal amount of water and the third day's sample was mixed with an equal amount of a mixture of guinea and Napier grasses and filled into silo No. III. During the filling of the silo pits, a representative sample was taken for analysis. Care was taken to tramp down the chopped matter very well, particularly at the sides of the pit to drive out as much air as possible. The pits were filled upto two feet above the ground level and covered with some ragi straw upto one foot thick. These were then covered with mud so as to give a hemispherical shape on the top. Finally the surface was plastered with a wet mixture of mud and cowdung so that the pit was almost air and water tight. All the pits were daily examined for any crevice on the surface and the crevices that appeared were immediately repaired. After three months the pits were opened, the top layer of ragi straw was removed and the silage examined for texture, flavour etc. A representative sample was removed from each silo pit for proximate analysis. Table I gives the results of the analysis before and after making the silage. 48

Twelve cows of almost the same stage of lactation, milk yield and body weight were selected from the Institute herd and were divided into four groups of three each. The normal concentrate ration of the animals consisted of a mixture of ricebran, gram, gram husk and groundnut cake in the ratio of 4:1.5:2.0:2.5. This was fed at the rate of one lb. for every two lb. of milk yielded by the animal. The roughage ration consisted of 55 lb. of green grass (mixture of guinea and Napier grasses) and three lb. of ragi straw per animal per day. The silage was fed in part replacement of the grass mixture in the normal roughage ration at the rate of two lb. silage for every three lb. of grass. Group I received silage from sugarcane tops alone, group II silage from sugarcane tops with molasses and group III received silage from sugarcane tops with mixture of farm grasses, while group IV remained as control, receiving the normal ration. On the first day of the feeding 15 lb. of the normal grass ration was replaced by 10 lb. of the particular silage in each experimental group. On the second day 22½ lb. of the grass ration was replaced by 15 lb. of the particular silage in each ex- perimental group. Thereafter 20 lb. of the particular silage was fed in replacement of 30 lb. of the grass mixture of the roughage in each of the experimental groups for one month. The control animals received the normal ration throughout the period of experiment. Also the dry matter of the roughage was maintained at the same level in all the groups throughout the period. The milk yield and fat percentage of the milk was observed at every milking and the average body weight of the animals were noted every week. The animals did not show any reluctance to consume 20 lb. of either of the silages per day, but they seemed to like the silage made with the addition of molasses better than that made without molasses and the silage made with a mixture of farm grasses was liked best by the animals. The molasses silage had a better aroma, while mixed grass silage was more acidic and softer also in texture. Tables II50 Suitability of Sugarcane Tops for Silage Making TABLE IIT. M. PAUL AND M. C.

KOTHAVALLA and A. J. LAZARUS, Imperial Dairy Reserarch Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 22 January 1946) THE milking of a cow before calving under normal circumstances is generally resorted to only when the animal is suffering from some udder trouble, particularly inflammation of the udder, which commonly occurs in high yielders and first calvers. As a rule this practice is objected to on mere sentimental grounds, as a measure counter to nature and because it is supposed to make calving more difficult. Neither the merits nor the demerits of preparturient milking have so far been put to a systematic test on a scientific basis. Of recent years increasing attention has been given to this subject of premilking of cows. It has been claimed by its advocates that the practice greatly enhances the milk yield of the animal and also reduces the chances of subsequent udder troubles, such as often arise in heavy milkers. Espe [1938] states that the massaging of the udder is quite a common practice to prevent the congestion which frequently occurs at the time of parturition. Webber and Turner [1929] have studied the in- fluence of milking pregnant animals before calving on their physical condition and the well-being of the progeny. Though these authors state that premilking increases the yield of milk after parturi- tion, they discourage the practice on account of its having adverse effects on the secretion of colos- trum. The investigations carried out by Sayer [1934] with the pedigree Sahiwal herd at Pusa is the only work done on the subject in India so far. This herd was established in 1904 and maintained under normal dairy conditions. In course of time a considerable amount of udder trouble arose in the herd, which seriously affected its performance. With view to remedying this evil the practice of massaging the udder and milking the cows before calving was introduced in 1932; after calving the animals were milked four times a day at equal intervals instead of only twice. Further, in the case of heifers the bag was massaged from about two months before calving and the animals were thoroughly accustomed to milking; when the milk flow started, all the milk was drawn out. After calving, the same animals were milked from 7 to 15 times a day until they began to let down all the milk. As a result of these trials a good many advantages have been claimed, the principal ones being that the udder troubles altogether disappeared and the milk yield of the heifers and cows increased on an average by about 47 per cent as compared with the pretreatment period. Whatever be the claims made for the adoption of premilking, one outstanding disadvantage of the practice persists and requires further investigation, namely that the calf dropped by the pre- milked cow does not receive the valuable colostrum, but Sayer (loc. cit.) in this connection claims that where the premilking of animals is adopted in a herd, the precalving colostrum would be given to calves born to premilked dams but in case that is not available the calf should be given linseed oil. By this method he asserts that mortality amongst calves was decreased from 4.3 to 1.4 per cent within a year of the adoption of this practice. Dover and Siva Subramanian [1939] from an inten- sive study of the chemical analysis of colostrum, have drawn attention to the fact that the colostrum obtained from premilked animals is deficient in globulin and ash to a considerable degree and they conclude from their other observations that the practice of premilking animals is a harmful one from the point of view of rearing the newly born calf. In view of these conflicting views it was considered that fresh evidence upon which the merits of the practice of preparturient milking could be judged was necessary and the investigation which is discussed below was undertaken. EXPERIMENTAL The investigation in question was carried out for two to three lactations on Sindhi cows and Sindhi, Gir and cross-bred heifers maintained at the Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore. Premilking of Cows. (i) Twelve Sindhi cows were taken for the experiment and an equal number of animals were kept as controls. The animals in these two groups were nearly of the same age, weight and stage of lactation at the start of the experiment. All the animals were healthy 52
ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA AND A. J. LAZARUS 53 and free from udder and other organic trouble. (ii) The animals in the experimental group were taken to the calving shed about a month before they were due to calve and in addition to the daily grooming and brushing, etc., the udders were massaged three to four times a day. (iii) When the udders began to fill out with milk, which occurred usually about 10 to 15 days before calving, the milk was drawn. The maximum quantity of milk thus obtained never exceeded 6.5 lb. the usual average being 4.7 lb. per day. (iv) Four days after calving, the animals were removed to the milking byre and milked twice a day during the whole lactation. (v) The control animals were treated in a similar manner except that their udders were not worked up, nor was any attempt made to draw off milk before calving. (vi) Particulars regarding milk yields of the lactations before and during the experiment and the birth-weight of calves in respect of both the control and experimental cows, etc. are given in Table I. One of the cows in the experimental group died after completing one lactation before further observations could be made. A few animals had to be disposed of during the third year of the experiment for various reasons. (vii) A record of the increase in the monthly weight of some of the calves during the first period of experiment was kept and the figures obtained are shown in Table III. The calves of the experimental animals were fed on the milk drawn from the respective dams. No separate colostrum was fed to them as it was the inten- tion to observe incidentally the effect of the preparturient treatment on the offspring.

(i) Forty heifers belonging to the Sindhi, Gir and cross-bred herds were taken for study and after dividing them into control and experimental groups were subjected to similar treatment, as indicated above for the cows. In this case as the milking potentialities of the animals were not known it was rather difficult to evenly distribute high and low yielders. (ii) After the premilking was started, as in the case of cows, the daily maximum yield obtained was 4.5 lb., the usual average being about 2.5 lb. (iii) After calving the heifers were milked four times a day for a week and this was reduced to three times a day for the following four weeks. By this time the animals settled down and the milking was subsequently done only twice a day for the rest of the lactation. (iv) The obervations made in respect of the heifers are given in Table II. (v) It was found that out of 55 animals subjected to the preparturient milking treatment, four showed some udder trouble and about 20 animals were slightly nervous at the time of calving.

(iv) From the last column in Table I, it will be observed that the average weight of all the male calves in the control group was 47 lb. and of the females 45 lb. The corresponding weights for the calves from the experimental group were for male calves 52 lb. and for female calves 44 lb. There was thus not much difference between the birth weights of the experimental and control calves. (v) A more significant difference is to be found when the weights of individual calves in the two groups are compared over a period of twelve months. This weight was recorded for some of the calves born during the first year of the experiment and the results obtain- ed are shown in Table III. For the sake of comparison the figures for male and female animals are given separately. It will be seen that, for the female calves the average weight at birth in the control group was 50 lb. and at the end of the first year it increased to 325 lb. In the experimental group these figures were 41 lb. and 285 lb. respectively. In both the groups the male calves started at almost the same level but while the animals of the control group had an average weight of 341 lb. at the end of 12 months, the experimental animals weighed only 308 lb. This is a very significant difference.

(i) In the case of heifers the general conclusions are very similar to those discussed above, for all the breeds studied. (ii) The choice of the animals for the control and ex- perimental groups was made so as to ensure that the animals of the same age and weight were evenly distributed in the two groups. In spite of this, the average yields for the control animals were in- variably higher than those for the experimental ones. (iii) In the experiment with Sindhi heifers, the annual milk yield for the control (over the whole period studied) was 2,526 lb., as against 2,360 lb. for the experimental animals. (iv) When the figures for only the first experimental year are compared, it will be found that the yields for the control and experimental groups are 2,399 lb. and 2,225 lb. respectively, indicating a slight set back instead of an improvement for the experimental animals. (v) Most of the Gir heifers were studied for three years consecutively. Here also the average annual yield of 2,304 lb. for the experimental animals was found significantly lower when compared to the figure of 2,943 lb. for the control group. (vi) The average annual milk yields in the case of cross-bred heifers for the control and the experimental groups over the whole period of investigation were 5,710 and 4,677 lb. respectively, thus corroborating the results obtained with Sindhi and Gir heifers. The results of the experiment bring out very significantly the following points (i) Preparturient treatment in an intensive form and premilking of cows and heifers do not in any way tend to improve the milk yield of the animals so treated. On the other hand it has an adverse effect especially in the case of heifers. The animals studied here might be regarded as moderate yielders and the re- sults may perhaps be slightly different in the case of heavy yielders. (ii) In the present studies the animals selected were in good health, having no udder trouble, but it is quite possible that the premilking treatment may prove of benefit where the animals are predisposed to such trouble as reported by Sayer [1934]. (iii) A very significant point brought out as a result of the present studies was the weak health of the calves born to cows which had been premilked. This is illustrated by Table III. (iv) In the case of heifers it was observed that during the whole period of study the death rate of calves in the control group was 5 per cent lower than that of those in the experimental group. (v) About 73 per cent of the calves that died in the experimental group did so during their first month of life; death was mostly due to digestive trouble. This demonstrates the importance of feeding colostrum to new born calves. (vi) Another important feature noticed in the case of all the experi- mental animals (cows and heifers) was retention of the placenta. Probably premilking causes weakness of muscular contraction of the uterus at parturition with the result that the placenta is not expelled. (vii) It was found that premilking and frequent massaging of the udder involved a considerable increase in the cost of maintaining the herd. (viii) Sometimes animals used to frequent milking, when removed from the calving shed and put with the herd and milked only twice a day, tended to hold their milk. This can be attributed to the extra handling which the animals were accustomed to during the preparturient treatment. SUMMARY The practice of milking Sindhi, Gir and cross-bred cows and heifers prior to calving was in no way advantageous. This treatment did not increase the milk yield to an extent which justified the extra cost involved. The calves of cows subjected to the treatment invariably failed to thrive as well as the controls and the mortality amongst them was very high. REFERENCES Dover and Siva Subramanian (1939).

PRESERVATIVE EFFECT OF COMMON SALT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACIDITY IN STORED GHEE By LAL CHAND DHARMANI and KARTAR SINGH LOHARA, Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur (Received for Publication on 15 May 1946) IN a hot country like India where butter cannot be stored for a long time, it is melted into ghee to prevent decomposition. The dehydrated and clarified butter fat is stored either in tins or in earthen pots. Thousands of maunds of butter are melted into ghee every day in India and its storage is an important problem which requires careful attention. Ghee, when stored for a long time, developes an acrid taste and unpleasant aroma which render it unfit for edible purposes and the acidity that finds its way into ghee during its preparation, is con- sidered to be the most important, if not the main cause of these developments. Moisture in the presence of heat, light and air accelerates the development of acidity. Banerjee and Doctor [1938] found that the acidity of ghee increased during storage from 4 to 36 days at 0ºC. and room temperature. Paul Arup [1929] found that ghee stored in bottles fitted with metal screw caps and cork discs for six years showed a marked decrease in R.M. value and there was a close correlation between the free fatty acids formed and the loss in volatile acids. Khubchandani [1939] studied the effect of citric acid and sodium citrate on flavour, aroma and keeping quality of butter and ghee. He added these compounds in the cream. The keeping quality was improved by citric acid. Godbole and Sad Gopal found, in one sample only, that salt acts as a preservative against the action of light, air and moisture on the fat. People in the Punjab adopt different methods of storing ghee in villages, the most common being to store it in tins or earthen pots. Common salt is used as a preservative either in the form of a big lump or as a powder. With a view to studying the preservative effect of common salt on the development of acidity in ghee during storage the experiment described below was carried out. EXPERIMENTAL Ghee was prepared according to the country method which is described in Allen's Commercial Organic Analysis (Fifth Edition, Volume II, page 431). It was further clarified and made moisture- free in the laboratory by heating it over a sand bath. Method of storage. Tins of about 1¼ lb. capacity with air tight covers were thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried in the air oven at 105ºC. for 24 hours. Ghee was melted at 40ºC. and 400 gms. of ghee were stored in each tin. Fresh distilled water was added to bring the moisture contents of the stored samples up to 0.5 per cent, 1.0 per cent and 1.5 per cent. Butter milk was used at the rate of 0.25 per cent only. Ordinary common salt was finely powdered and added at the rate of 2 per cent of the weight of ghee. The tins were covered with air tight covers and shaken vigorously for a sufficiently long time to insure dispersion of water and salt. Five samples of each treatment were kept. The experiment was arranged as follows: Tin No. Treatment 1 to 5 ........ 0.5 per cent moisture 6 to 10 ........ 1.0 per cent moisture 11 to 15 ........ 1.5 per cent moisture 16 to 20 ........ 0.5 per cent moisture and 2.0 per cent salt 21 to 25 ........ 1.0 per cent moisture and 2.0 per cent salt 26 to 30 ........ 1.5 moisture and 2.0 per cent salt 31 to 35 ........ No treatment 36 to 40 ........ 0.25 per cent butter milk 41 to 45 ........ 0.25 per cent butter milk and 2 per cent salt 59
60 Acidity in Stored Ghee All these treatments were repeated using small earthen pots of almost of the same capacity 1¼ lb. and with earthen lids except that butter milk was used at the rate of 1.0 per cent and 2.0 per cent. Before filling the earthen pots the dispersion of water and salt was effected by putting melted ghee in a stoppered glass bottle and shaking it for some time. When the water and salt were well dispersed the sample was quickly poured in the pot and covered with a lid and cloth was wrapped over the mouth of the pot. The butter milk used was obtained from the College dairy and contained 0.2 per cent lactic acid acidity. All the stored samples were kept in the laboratory for about fifteen months. The temperature of the laboratory room varied from 34ºF. minimum in winter to 114ºF. maximum in summer. The earthen pots were placed in 500 c.c. capacity porcelain dishes. The samples were tested periodically for acid value, smell, colour and taste. Acid value was determined by the method described in A.O.A.C. and the taste and smell were judged by five Research Assistants working in these laboratories. Sampling for analysis. Ghee was melted by placing the tins in hot water (40ºC. to 45ºC.). The tin was shaken well and opened. The smell was noted. It was then filtered at 40ºC. through filter paper (Whatman No. 1). The filtered sample was tested for smell, taste and acid value. The results are given in Tables No. I and II. They are the averages of duplicate readings and in certain cases triplicate determinations. The difference between the duplicate samples was very little and in many cases there was no difference at all.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Ghee was stored at room temperature in air tight tins on 28-7-1943. The acid value of the original sample was 0.50 (Table I). The increase in the acid value was very slow both in the salted and unsalted samples. After a period of 15 months the increase in acid value was from 0.50 to 0.73. There was no change in the aroma and taste of the samples. These results clearly indicate that ghee can be stored in air tight containers for a period of 15 months without undergoing any deterioration in quality. In the absence of air and light, moisture alone does not affect the keeping quality of ghee. The addition of salt, therefore, appears to be unnecessary. Commercial samples of ghee always contain a certain amount of butter milk (lassi) and there- fore, samples were also stored with 0.25 per cent butter milk, and it can be seen from the figures in Table I that this amount of butter milk did increase the acid value though to a slight extent. Salt in the presence of butter milk enhanced the development of acidity. These samples of ghee deve- loped a rancid smell after a period of nine months. Earthen pots. In earthen pots, the addition of salt checked the development of acidity, in ghee, but, as the pots could not be made air tight, air and heat played their part fully. Samples of ghee kept in earthen pots developed a very bad smell after a period of five months, inspite of the fact that the acid value was not very high. Besides the ghee oozed out of the pots during summer and considerable loss occurred. The actual losses were not determined but from the amount of ghee found in the dishes and on the outer surface of the pots, it was judged that the storage of ghee in earthen pots during summer months is not to be recommended. SUMMARY To study the preservative effect of common salt, ghee with varying amounts of moisture and butter milk (0.5 to 1.5 per cent) was kept in 1¼ lb. tins and earthen pots of the same capacity. Salt was used at the rate of 2 per cent of the weight of ghee. I
62 Acidity in Store d Ghee. The development of rancidity of ghee was judged by the characteristic aroma, acrid taste and increase in free fatty acids. Samples were tested periodically for 15 months. The results so for obtained show that a good quality ghee can safely be stored in air tight tins upto 15 months without showing any signs of deterioration. The use of common salt appears to be unnecessary. It is not advisable to store ghee in earthen pots because the acidity developes rapidly and because the ghee oozes out of the pots during summer months and thus causes considerable loss.

AN ACCOUNT OF TWO SPECIES OF LUNGWORMS FROM INDIAN GOATS* By M. M. SARWAR, Department of Food, Government of India, New Delhi (Received for publication on 15 December 1944) (With three text-figures) THE generic differentiation of species in the family Metastrongylidae is to a large extent based on the shape and arrangement of accessory pieces. These organs are elaborate and present varied features and this has resulted in a considerable confusion in adoption of proper terminology for these structures. Looss [1905] applies the term gubernaculum to a structure defined as 'thick brown chitinuous piece . . . . found embedded in the dorsal wall'. He thinks its function to lie in changing within certain limits the direction of the spicula when they are protruded. Hall [1921] uses the word gubernaculum for the more or less longitudinal structure in the dorsal wall of the cloaca towards the anterior end and the term telamon for the 'structure of variable form near the cloacal aperture'. Cameron [1927] applies the term telamon to the longitudinal paired accessory pieces and gubernaculum for the anteriorly placed unpaired ones. Gebauer [1932] uses the term in just the reverse order. Schulz, Orlow and Kutass [1933] call the whole arrangement as gubernaculum and designate the three parts as capitulum, corpus and crura. They apply the term telamon to a structure of variable form near the clcacal aperture. Such a structure has been pointed out in Varestrongylus pneumonicus by Bhalerao [1932], in Pneumostrongylus calcaratus by Monnig [1933] as a refractive piece of chitin which moves with the telamon gubernaculum of Gebauer [1932]. In Pneumostrognylus alpenae Dikmans [1935] refers to the above structure as an unpaired accessory piece consisting of two proximally united deeply pigmented portions situated in the terminal portion of the body. The arrangement of the accessory pieces suggests that capitulum, corpus and crura are intimately connected in function and modified accordingly in different species. In the species of the genus Pro- tostronglus there is a capitulum and two pairs of corpus and crura arising separately. In Protos- trongylus austriacus [Gebauer, 1932] the crura are fused at their anterior ends, in V. pneumonicus the corpus and crura are fused at their anterior and posterior ends respectively and capitulum has disappeared. In Dictyocaulus filaria (Fig I, a) the crura are fused and the corpus appear to de- generate while capitulum has disappeared. In the family Trichostrngylidae the appearance of gubernaculum suggests it to be the result of a more intimate adhesion of the crura. The capitulum and corpus, which are probably supporting structures to the crura when paired, disappear when the crura have fused as in the genera Varestrongylus, Neostrongylus and Pneumostrongylus. In the following lines have been described two species, one under the genus Varestrongylus and the other under Protostrongylus. The protostrongylus species was collected from a goat once only while the Varestrongylus species was twice collected mixed with V. pneumonicus, the latter species predominating. Varestrongylus capricola SARWAR 1944 The specimens which consist of three males and a number of females were collected from small bronchi of a goat at Mukteswar. Male has a total length from 15 to 18 mm. and a width of about 0.14 mm. at about the anterior ends of the spicules. Oesophagus is 0.275 mm. long and 0.05 mm. broad and is lanceolate in shape. The bursa (Fig I, b) consists of two lateral and a dorsal lobe and the rays are disposed as fol- lows: *The paper was read before the 31st session of the Indian Science Congress held at Delhi in 1944. 63

Externo-dorsal is a slender ray, and arises independently. The dorsal ray is small and ends in apparently six papillae. Spicules are 0.25-0.26 mm. long and are bent at about their middle. They are bifid at their posterior ends as in V. pneumonicus and are deeply pigmented. The cuticularized lamellae are coarser and heavier than those of the members of the genus Protostrongylus. It may, however, be remarked that measurements of spicules in 75 specimens of V. pneumonicus have shown them to vary from 0.42 to 0.45 mm. only. The telamon consists of two yellowish chitinous pieces having indentations on their outer edges. Each piece measures about 0.025 mm. long and is situated near the cloacal aperture. Females resemble those of V. pneumonicus except that the vulvar flaps are vestigial only. Length of oesophagus is 0.4 mm, and breadth about 0.065 mm. Vagina is 0.85 mm. long with the vulva situated in close proximity with the anus. Tail is about 0.05 mm. long. The eggs measure 0.065- 0.07 × 0.03-0.04 mm.

Gubernaculum (V. pneumonicus) Several genera have been created under the family Metastrongylidae to accommodate numerous species with elaborate accessory structures of varied shapes and arrangement. An examination of material of various species can bring down a reduction in the known number of genera. Pneumos- trongylus Monnig 1935 and Neostrongylus Gebauer 1932 are closely allied to Varestrongylus in their having fused crura and capitulum being absent. The spicules in the genera Varestrongylus and Pneumostrongylus have coarse cuticularised lamellae and telamon structures near the cloaca have been described. The species described in the preceding pages differs from the only other species of this genus by the absence of the spindle shaped gubernaculum described by Bhalerao [1932]. Protostrongylus indicus SARWAR 1944 Male: Total length is unknown as no entire specimen was collected. Breadth in the region of proximal end of spicule is about 0.17 mm. Rays of the bursa are disposed in pattern characteristic of the genus. Externo-lateral ray is separate and is widely separated from ventral. Medio-lateral and postero-lateral rays originate from a common stem and are separated in their distal parts. Ex- terno-dorsal is relatively short. The dorsal is not studied in detail being folded beneath the body. Spicules are from 042 to 0.5 mm. long and are characteristic of the genus with minute chitinoid fibrillations fringing their medical sides. The posterior end of spicule is devoid of fibrillations, is thinner and curved and presents a protrusion on the ventral side (Fig 3, d). The spicular sheath extends beyond the ends of the spicules for about 0.02 mm.

M. M. SARWAR 67 This species may be distinguished from P. ocreatus, P. refescens, P. stilesi and P. raillieti by the presence of a boot shaped accessory piece in the first and the presence of teeth on the posterior parts of crura in the latter three species. In P. macrotis and P. capreolus capitulum is absent. P. aus- triacus has proximal ends of crura fused. P. rushi lacks a provagina. In P. rupicaprae the curved arms of capitulum are directed laterally and the characteristic curved pieces with keels are absent. The posterior end of spicule is devoid of fibrillations, is thinner and curved and presents a protrusion on the ventral side (Fig, 3, d). A characteristic of P. indicus is the presence of a long vagina. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The author is grateful to S.M. Sarwar, Esq., M.B.E. for his help in presentation of the matter.

SANKARNARAYAN, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 8 August 1946) (With Plate I) SPECIFIC conjunctivitis of sheep and goats is known to exist in North and South Africa, the French Congo, the Levant, France, parts of the United States of America, in Uruguay and in Australia and New Zealand. Coles [1931] defined the cause of the condition in S. Africa as a new species of Rickettsia for which he proposed the name R. conjunctivæ, and this ætiological finding is accepted in those countries where the disease exists. According to Donatien and Lestoquard [1939] the disease is highly infectious and presumably air-borne, spreading rapidly through flocks and herds through the medium of ocular and nasal discharges. One eye is usually affected, excep- tionally both, the chief signs of the disease being intense conjunctivitis with lachrymation and pho- tophobia. The conjunctivæ of the swollen lids show either sparse or numerous fine granulations, and within a few days of the onset of the disease, muco-pus collects at the inner canthus of the affected eye. In spite of the sudden and somewhat alarming early signs of the disease, it is essentially benign in nature and the great majority of cases tend to recover spontaneously within ten days or so from the onset of the affection. In some cases, however, keratitis develops and pannus-like lesions are seen, i.e. invasion of the cornea by vascular stems infiltrating from the corneo-sclerotic margin. Cor- neal opacity is a fairly common sequel in these cases, and, if it be accompanied by ulceration, there is always the danger of a secondary bacterial infection of the inner eye. Diagnosis is said to be relatively straightforward. The disease is usually easily transmitted to healthy sheep or goats by rubbing a little of the infective eye discharge over the healthy eyeball. preferably after mild scarification of the conjunctiva. The incubation period is 270 Conjunctivitis of Sheep and Goats in India existence of rickettsial conjunctivitis in sheep and goats in the Punjab. The present paper outlines the work undertaken by us on behalf of the Veterinary Investigation Officer, Bihar. Two goats were used in the test of material received from the January 1941 outbreak of disease in goats. The left eyeball of each goat was anaesthetised with 1 per cent cocaine solution, the corneal surface lightly scarified, and a few drops of suspected infective ocular discharge rubbed in. The disease could not be transmitted and no rickettsiæ were demonstrable in conjunctival films of field cases, stained Giemsa and Wolbach-Pinkerton. The disease again appeared in sheep in Bihar in October, 1941, and two sheep were received at Izatnagar as described below. Sheep 1. This animal was affected with a severe, bilateral conjunctivitis with keratitis and pannus formation, the cornea of both eyes bulging and being quite opaque. No granulations were seen within the conjunctivæ of the lids, nor could rickettsiæ be demonstrated within the conjunctival cells. However, numerous polymorphs and Gram-positive diplococci, many phagocytosed, were evident in such concentration as to suggest a pure bacterial infection. The animal was destroyed and both eyes dissected. The anterior chamber contained a few fibrin shreds and the aqueous humour was slightly cloudy, but neither cells nor organisms could be detected on film examination. The lens, ciliary body, iris and inner structure of the eye appeared normal, and the vitreous was clear. Sections of the eyeball taken from the ora serrata of the retinal coat through the ciliary body, iris and cornea, after formalin fixation and staining by haematoxylin and eosin, showed irido-cyclitis and interstitial keratitis with intense eosinophilia, strongly suggestive of a parasitic infection. How- ever, no nematode parasites could be detected in sections stained by Giemsa or Læffler. The vitamin A liver reserve of this case was within normal limits. With material from this animal, two sheep, with apparently normal eyes, were inoculated in the anterior chamber of the eye with a few drops of mixed aqueous-vitreous humour. No reaction occurred in either animal over 85 days of observa- tion. Sheep 2. Both eyes were equally affected, the eyeballs bulging, and the cornea cloudy, save at the margin where pannus-like lesions were noted. No rickettsiæ were observed in Giemsa-stained films of the conjunctival epithelium, while by Gram's stain polymorphs were seen to be very numerous with diplococcal organisms similar morphologically to those seen in the first case. Cultures on blood agar from the conjunctiva, after swabbing with warm normal saline, yielded a Gram-positive dip- lococcus morphologically similar to the organism seen on direct film examination, and a smooth strain of Bac. subtilis. Two sheep were inoculated immediately under the bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye with two drops of a 48-hour serum broth culture of the coccus isolated, which was also liberally rubbed over the conjunctival surfaces of the same eye. No reaction occurred over a period of two months. With two other sheep, the bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye was lightly scarified under cocaine anaesthesia and the ocular discharge from Sheep 2 well rubbed in. Observation over 82 days failed to reveal any lesions. Also, two healthy sheep were kept in close contact in the same shed with Sheep 2, but neither contracted the disease during 82 days contact; incidentally, flies were numerous in the shed during this time. During the interval entailed by these transmission tests in sheep, very considerable improvement occurred in the eyes of Sheep 2, and after about ten weeks the only visible lesion was some haziness of the cornea and increased vascularity at the corneo- sclerotic margin; the intra-ocular tension had also abated. This phase was dramatically interrupt- ed by a sharp and severe attack of conjunctivitis affecting both eyes, but no granulations were seen within the bulbar or palpebral conjunctivæ. Films from both these surfaces, however, stained by Giemsa and thionin blue, showed on this occasion unmistakable rickettsiæ within the majority of the conjunctival cells, either densely packed or disposed in tight clusters within the cytoplasm (Plate I, fig. I). The morphology and staining affinities of these organisms corresponded precisely with the original description of R. conjunctivæ Coles, 1931. At the same time, the signs of bacterial infection, originally noted in Sheep 2, again came into prominence in addition to the rickettsial infection. We were disappointed in our further efforts serially to transmit the disease to the eyes of healthy sheep.
J. F. SHIRLAW AND N. S. SANKARNARAYAN 71 EXAMINATION FOR RICKETTSIAE OF NORMAL EYES OF SHEEP, GOATS AND HILL CATTLE A flock of 36 sheep and a herd of 29 goats maintained at the Institute were examined for evidence of ocular disease; with one exception, a goat affected with a unilateral, puru- lent conjunctivitis, none showed any sign of active or latent conjunctivitis, keratitis or granulations within the conjunctival membrane suggestive of rickettsial infection. Conjunctival films from 32 of the goats (including the case of purulent conjunctivitis) and 10 of the sheep were examined for rickettsiæ. These were demonstrable within the conjunctival cells of every case. The extent of the infection was variable; in a few cases, it was well marked, up to 60 per cent of conjunctival cells harbouring the organism. In most cases, the organism was found in about 10 per cent of the cells. In four goats, the infection was light and some search was necessary to demonstrate the orga- nism. The extent of the infection within the cells was variable in individual films. Some cells were densely packed with organisms (Plate I, fig. II), or they were present in clusters chiefly at the margins of cells. Occasionally, a few small clumps were found extracellularly, apparently liberated by the degeneration of infected cells. However, cell degeneration was not a conspicuous feature, and even a massive cell infection seemed well tolerated. The morphology and staining affinity of the organism conformed in detail to the classic description of R. conjunctivæ. Neutrophils were occasionally seen in conjunctival films, and in a few cases Gram positive diplococci, many within the phagocytes. In the solitary case of conjunctivitis, rickettsiæ were evident within the conjunc- tival cells but this finding was overshadowed by an apparent bacterial infection. Whilst in some films, neutrophils were present and apparently unaccompanied by bacteria, we did not consider that such cells were a concomitant feature of the infection; and, when present, they appeared to have no numerical relationship with the extent or intensity of the infection. In two of five hill cattle examined, 30 per cent of the conjunctival cells were infected with rickettsiæ; in the remainder, cell infection was light but definite. No morphological or tinctorial differentiation could be established between the cattle and the goat organism. EXAMINATION OF CASES OF HUMAN TRACHOMA This was undertaken to compare the morphology and staining affinities of the goat organism with the human one. Eight cases were selected for examination, one an early active infection, three advanced and chronic, and four old and active. Rickettsiæ were determined within the conjunc- tival cells in every case, the intensity of the infection varying in different cases, apparently inde- pendently of the clinical activity of the condition. No distinction was possible between the human and the goat forms of the parasite. DISCUSSION The scope of this investigation has been limited. Only on two occasions have we been notified of cases of conjunctivitis in sheep and goats in India. Enquiries from Veterinary Investigation Officers in the provinces (other than the Punjab) indicate that the disease has not been observed and a careful survey is obviously called for. During the war years, a large number of goats and sheep have passed through veterinary inspection at meat dehydration plants and army depots concerned with the collection and dispatch of these animals for the supply of meat in the eastern theatre of war. We had recently an opportunity of visiting one of these goats and sheep collecting depots where among thousands of animals we saw no evidence of the disease. The traffic in goats and sheep during the war years throughout northern India to these collecting depots has been so enormous that the animals in the depots have been a fair random sample of the goat populations in this part of India. We have had reports from the depots of every disease to which goats and sheep are subject; yet, only on one occasion have we had a report of conjunctivitis. A diagnosis of rickettsial con- junctivitis was made on examination of conjunctival films from a few cases, but this small outbreak cleared up before a field investigation could be undertaken. We have also seen a few scattered cases of keratitis among several thousand goats passing through a large meat dehydration plant in the North West Frontier Province, but nothing in the nature of an outbreak of the disease; indeed,
72 Conjunctivitis of Sheep and Goats in India the incidence of the affection was so insignificant as to occasion no comment by the local Veterinary Officers and it would certainly have passed unnoticed had we not been particularly on the look out for it. Nor have we encountered the affection in the many hundreds of goats used in experimental work at the Institute over the last four years. In our limited investigation into the ætiology of conjunctivitis and keratitis of sheep and goats in Bihar, we arrived at the conclusion that the condition had much in common with the similar disease described in these animals by Coles [1931], and that the cause was R. conjunctivæ. It is true that the disease we investigated was clinically similar to that described by Coles, and that R. conjunctivae was identified in one of the sheep from Bihar and in several cases of the same disease in goats occur- ring at an army depot in 1945, but we are now by no means convinced of the ætiological relationship of these organisms. There are two main reasons for our doubt. Organisms which cannot be different- tiated from R. conjunctivæ on morphological characters and staining affinities have been demon- strated within the conjunctival cells of every goat and sheep and of the few bovines that we have examined, and, with one exception, the eyes of all the animals selected for examination were per- fectly healthy. We have no doubt that, if we extended our examination, the finding would be practically universal. In the second place we failed to infect the conjunctival membrane of normal sheep with ocular discharge from a frank case of conjunctivitis in a sheep from Bihar in which R. conjunctivæ was identified within the conjunctival cells. This experience confirmed the work of the field workers in Bihar and is contrary to the experience of workers in other countries on rickett- sial conjunctivitis in small ruminants. One possible explanation of our experience is that the infec- tion is really ubiquitous and latent in the sheep and goats that we have worked with, even if there are no apparent sub-clinical lesions. Abdussalam [1944] found rickettsiæ similar to R. conjunctivæ within the conjunctival cells of a buffalo affected with conjunctivitis, but makes no comment on the examination of healthy eyes of the same animal species. He also records that, on examination of the eyes 24 of Malvi goats, chronic trachoma-like lesions were found in every case and rickettsiæ identified within the conjunctival cells, although there was no outward appearance of eye affection such as keratitis. He considers that these animals had suffered from a more acute form of the disease in their kidhood, and that in the adult this had reached a stage of chronicity. No systematic examination, however, of kids in the area was undertaken. It is also noteworthy that no transmission experiments with materi- als from the Malvi goats could be carried out, as 'unaffected goats could not be made available '. It is not quite clear from this statement whether all the goats in the area were affected with specific conjunctivitis, or simply whether R. conjunctivæ infection could be determined within the conjunc- tival cells of these goats. If the latter, it agrees with our own observations. In the eyes of the normal goats and sheep which we examined, and in which we found rickettsiæ conforming in type to R. conjunctivæ, we have seen no signs of persistent and chronic trachoma-like lesions. According to information received, sub-clinical trachoma is a prevalent affection among the Indian population, and, even in apparently normal eyes, can be detected by slit-lamp examination of the vessels of the limbus. It may well be that a more careful examination of the eyes of goats and sheep on these lines would give a more accurate interpretation of the finding of R. conjunctivæ, within the conjunctival epithelium of these animals though, on naked eye examination, there is no evident abnormality. It may well be that the latency of the animal disease is similar to what has been observed in the human population. In this connection, it seems worth emphasising the statement of Beveridge [1942] that, although it has not been possible to prove the ætiological role of R. conjunctivæ in con- tagious conjunctivitis of goats and sheep, there is strong justification for accepting it as a working hypothesis. If, however, this position be accepted in respect of frank clinical cases of the disease in which the organism can be identified, what interpretation can be vouchsafed for the identification of the parasite in cases where no clinical disease exists? There is one last point. Contagious conjunctivitis of sheep and goats has been described as a superficial infection, and yet, although little work seems to have done on the essential pathology of the condition, there is some evidence that the deeper structures of the eye may be involved. Thus, Coles [1931] describes lesions of irido-cyclitis. It is not clear whether this lesion is considered a direct
J. F.SHIRLAW AND N. S. SANKARNARAYAN 73 sequel of an inward extension of a superficial rickettsial infection, but the genesis of the lesion is one that requires complete elucidation. As stated, we encountered this lesion in one case examined pathologically. SUMMARY 1. A sporadic disease of goats and sheep clinically comparable with rickettsial conjunctivitis [Coles, 1931] exists in Bihar and has been detected, in a minor outbreak, in an army live-stock depot in India. An organism identified as R. conjunctivæ occurs within the cells of the conjunctival epithe- lium of such cases. 2. An organism indifferentiable in morphological characters and staining affinities from R. conjunctivæ was detected within the conjunctival cells of 32 goats, 10 sheep and five hill cattle selected at random, and in which, with one exception, viz. a goat affected with purulent conjunctivitis, the eyes showed no outward sign of disease. 3. An identical form of rickettsia was seen within the conjunctival cells of eight cases of human trachoma examined. 4. Lesions of irido-cyclitis were determined in one clinical case in a sheep. 5. The disease could not be transmitted to sheep with outwardly healthy eyes by means of ocular discharge from a diseased animal or by close contact in a small shed over a period of 82 days. 6. It is doubtful whether the finding of R. conjunctivæ in cases of conjunctivitis in the Indian goat and sheep has real ætiological significance. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Dr C. A.

EFFECT OF FOUR TIMES MILKING AND HANDLING ON THE YIELD OF MILK IN COWS OF THE THARPARKAR BREED By C. H. PARR and S. SEN, Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi (Received for publication on 20 September 1946) (With Plate II and three text figures) THE frequency of milking has considerable effect on the secretion of milk in dairy cows. Ragsdale et al. [1924] observed that the longer the interval between milkings, the less the speed of milk secretion per unit of time. They found that if the amount of milk secreted during the first hour were represented as 100 per cent, the amount secreted in each succeeding hour would be approximate- ly 95 per cent of that secreted during the previous hour. Woodward [1931] held that relief from the pressure of milk within the udder as a result of frequent milking allowed secretion to proceed more freely. Hammond [1936] found that the retardation of the rate of secretion and the final cessation of milk production were caused by the pressure created by the accumulated milk rather than the chemical effect of its constituents within the udder. Ispe [1941] has stressed the necessity for in- termittent periods of intramammary pressure in order to stimulate milk secretion and advocates that the maximum milk production can be secured by frequent milking and thus preventing an accumulation of milk in the udder. Ispe and Hammond are also of the opinion that the possibility of milk or fat being secreted into the blood stream during periods of high intramammary pressure appears improbable. Bartlett [1929] showed that the yields of milk and fat at morning milkings after a long night interval, although greater in amount, were not in proportion to the interval of time between the respective milkings. He attributed the cause to reabsorption of milk taking place during the long night interval. To avoid this depression and to obtain optimum results he suggested the shortening of the long night milking interval. EXPERIMENT WITH THARPARKAR COWS An experiment to compare four and two times milking on Tharparkar cows maintained at the Karnal Sub-station of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute was started in 1939. Twenty- four cows were selected for this purpose. Most of the cows had completed their first lactations when the experiment was started. As one cow died, data were available pertaining to eleven cows under four times milking and twelve cows under two times milking. The cows under four times milking were milked and 'handled', i.e., the udder was massaged before calving for about ten minutes every day for a period of 15 to 20 days and regularly milked once a day as soon as milk secretion started, following the practice introduced by Sayer [1934] in the Sahiwal herd at Pusa and subsequent continued with the same herd at Delhi as a standard practice. Rationing. Roughages were fed ad lib. in the form of bhusa (bruised oat and wheat straw), green sorghum, green cowpeas, green berseem, sorghum silage and berseem hay to provide the nutri- ents required for maintenance of animals of weights varying from 750 to 1,200 lb. Concentrates were fed in the proportion of one pound concentrates for every two pounds of milk yield. The com- position of the concentrate ration was generally as follows:76 Four Times Milking in Cows of Tharparkar Breed three lactations and one cow four lactations when they were taken into the experimentC. H. PARR AND SEN 77 between the average values of columns 6A and 8A and of columns 5A and 7A represents the average percentage increase due only to increasing the frequency of milking from two to four times. It will be noted from columns 6A and 8A, cows under four times milking, that increases in yield varying from 10.32 to 51.19 per cent have been obtained in the second and third lactations which may be taken as normal behaviour in milch animals advancing toward their prime or optimum age of production coupled with four times milking. Columns 5A and 7A show, however, that in the cases of animals continued on two times milking, this increase has occurred in only one case, viz. 'Lasni' in her third lactation and this on a lower scale than the lowest of the range of variation in the case of cows under four times milking. In all other cases there has been a distinct fall in production in the second and third lactations. In the case of 'Qabdi' this was to the extent of 39.53 per cent in the second lactation which was continued in the third to the extent of 11.60 per cent. Under two times milking it would appear that the normal development of milk secretion in Indian cows does not take place whether the optimum conditions of feed and other items of management are provided or not. The difference between the average yields of the 'four-time milkers' and 'two-time milkers was calculated by taking into consideration the average values of columns 6 and 8 (average yields of 'four-times milkers' in the second and third lactations respectively) and of columns 5 and 7 (average yields of 'two-time milkers' in the second and third lactations respectively). The milk yield data of the second set of eleven cows were considered as another group for the purpose of statistical examination as shown in Table II. The same procedure of analysis was applied to this group. TABLE II Average milk yield (wet period) in lb. per day of eleven cows milked four times a day in their pre-experi- mental first lactation.

Percentage increase (+) or decrease (78 Four Times Milking in Cows of Tharparkar Breed The cows named in column 2 of Table II were milked four times throughout, i.e., in their pre- experimental first lactations and experimental second, third and fourth lactations. It will be noted that bigger yields are recorded in the case of all these animals, except 'Machkani', who aborted at her second calving and that the increase ranges up to 82.23 per cent. It will be seen that there is an increase in each lactation averaging 19.54 lb. in first, 21.24 lb. in second, 25.29 lb. in third and 27.14 lb. in fourth lactations. Cows named in column 1, were milked four times in the pre-experi- mental first lactations and two times in their experimental second, third and fourth lactations. It will be noted that in the second lactation there was a distinct decrease in the case of each cow vary- ing from 5.01 to 19.57 per cent and that the range of decrease increased with subsequent lactations. The average percentage decrease of six cows in each lactation over their first lactation being 12.16 in the second, 12.52 in the third and 14.24 in the fourth lactations. Here, the difference between the average values of columns 5A, 7A and 9A and of columns 6A, 8A and 10A represents the average percentage decrease due alone to decreasing the frequency of milking from four to two times. The increases from first to fourth lactations recorded in the case of four times milking represent the aver- age expected behaviour of normal lactating cows. The decrease shown by the cows under two times milking represents behaviour which is at variance with what is considered normality. As before, the difference between the average yields of the 'four-time milkers' and 'two- time milkers' was estimated from columns 6, 8 and 10 and columns 5, 7 and 9 respectively. Finally, in Table III are given the means with their standard errors and co-efficients of varia- tion for (a) total milk yield per lactation, (b) average milk yield per day for wet period, (c) average over all milk yield per day, (d) length of wet period, (e) length of dry period and (f) length of service period for all the cows under two times and four times milking separately. MILK YIELD AND LIVE-WEIGHT GRAPHS Graph I shows the average milk yields of eleven 4-week periods of cows under two and four times milking in six consecutive lactations. Curve A represents the average first lactation yield of 11 cows under four times milking and Curve B represents the average first lactation yield of seven cows under two times milking. Of the 11 cows in Curve A, five went under four times milking and six under two times milking in the subsequent lactations and of the seven cows in Curve B, four were under two times milking and three under four times milking. The first lactations in both cases covered the pre-experimental period. They are both normal in type for first lactations, with the only difference, that the yields under the four times milking are on a higher level than under two times milking. A definite flush period is usually not well developed in the first lactation under either four times or two times milking. It has been our experience, working with two Indian breeds, that even in the case of good milkers there is a tendency to flatness throughout the length of the first lactation curve as compared with subsequent lactations. The daily yield at the end of the first lactation of good milkers is about half that given at the time of maximum production during the lactation. The difference in the effects of the two systems of milking is clear from the form of the curves obtained when the subsequent yields are graphed. Four times milking shows a definite and steady upward trend with each succeeding lactation. It is the development of the flush period under the four times milking which contributes to the increases in the yields, though each lactation finishes at about the same level as the first lactation. Under the two times milking, on the other hand, no development of the flush period takes place. Although yields in the early part of the subsequent lactations are somewhat higher than those of the first lactation, the drop in yield in the course of the lactation is sudden, and this rapid downward trend results in daily yields below those of the first lactation and a lower final total lactation yield. There is also a tendency to a shortening of the lactation period. Regardless as to whether the cows were milked four times or two times in the first lactation, there was a definite fall under two times milking in the subsequent lactations and similarly there was an increase in each subsequent lactation under four times milking.

C. H. PARK and SEN 81 From the experience of four times milking on two different Indian breeds (Sahiwal and Thar- parkar), it has been found that cows with normal first lactations under two times milking when put under four times milking in subsequent lactations, develop milk capacity in a manner similar to those which have been under four times milking from first calving. The shape of the graph and the yield during the last three months of the first lactation is a good index to subsequent yields. FIG 2. It will be of interest to compare these milk yield curves with those of a typical cow of the Sahiwal breed under four times milking. Graph II shows the yields of the Sahiwal cow 'Naraee' under four times milking in seven consecutive lactations. The first lactation curve shows the typical flatness indicating high possibility of persistency in yields as demonstrated in the subsequent lacta- tions. There has been normal development of flush period in each subsequent lactation up to the sixth, the seventh lactation showing the beginning of the decline with age. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 3. Average weight of cows under two and four times milking. When the yield curves of cows under two and four times milking are considered along with curves showing the variation in weight during the lactation, as in Graph III, it is seen that under two times milking cows lost little weight after calving, and made speedy gains throughout the lac- tation, although the concentrates given in both the cases were in proportion to the milk yields. There is a definite fall in weight of those under four times milking coinciding with the flush period and this loss may amount to 100 lb. or more which is normal to cows of high milk yield. DISCUSSION The percentage increases of the second and third lactations over the first lactation of cows under two times milking in the first lactation and four times milking in the subsequent lactations are com- pared with those of the cows which were retained on two times milking in the second and third lac- tations (vide Table 1). There is an increase of 41 per cent in yield which is due alone to increasing the frequency of milking from two to four times. The actual difference between the average yields of the 'four-time milkers' and 'two-time milkers' in their second and third lactations in this group shows an increase of 36 per cent of milk yield in favour of the four-time milking. Similarly, when the percentage increases of the second, third and fourth lactations over the first lactation of cows under four times milking in the first lactation and continued on four times milking in the subsequent lactations are compared with the percentage decreases in the second, third and fourth lactations over the first lactation of cows under four times milking in the first lactation and two times milking
82 Four Times Milking in Cows of Tharparkar Breed in the subsequent lactations (vide Table II), a decrease of 41 per cent of yield is observed which is attributed to reducing the frequency of milking from four to two times, since all other conditions so far as these are controlable were the same. The actual difference between the average yields of the 'four-time milkers' and 'two-time milkers' in their second, third and fourth lactations is 51 per cent. All these increases and decreases are statistically significant. Taking all cows under two times milking and four times milking separately the percentage increases due to four times milk- ing are 74 per cent for lactation yield, 47 per cent for average daily milk yield and 61 per cent for average overall daily milk yield. The lower percentage for daily yield as compared with lactation yield is due to the effect two-time milking has in decreasing the number of days in milk. These striking increases due to four times milking coupled with 'handling' are far in excess of results obtained with other breeds abroad. Ragsdale et al. [1934] after experimenting with Jersey and Ayr- shire cows in Missouri (U. S. A.) found that four times milking effected 16 per cent increase of milk over cows milked twice a day. In Maryland (U. S. A.) with Holsteins, Woodward [1931] found that three times milking gave 20 per cent more milk and 21 per cent more butter-fat than cows milked twice a day. Campbell [1930] found that the average increased yield of nine Graded Shorthorns (at the Reading University Farm, U. K.) in their thrice daily milking year over the yield in then preceding lactation was 19.3 per cent. The average calving interval for cows under four times milking is 442 days, which is about 28 days longer than that of cows under two times milking. This is due to the slightly longer service period necessitated by longer lactation period in the case of cows under four times milking. But this longer calving interval has not affected the overall average, which is 61 per cent more than in the case of the cows under two times milking. Table IV shows the trend of yields of cows in the Sahiwal and Tharparkar herds in five succes sive lactations under two and four times milking. It will be seen that under four times milking the first lactation yield is 55 per cent higher in the case of the Tharparkar and 70 per cent higher in the case of the Sahiwal than the corresponding yield under two times milking. Yet under four times milking, most of the later lactations show significant increase over the first lactation which is not the case under two times milking.

C. H. PARR AND SEN 83 The results obtained in the experiment are thus in line with practical experience with the Sahiwal herd at both Pusa and New Delhi and with the Tharparkar herd at Karnal. In Table V are given the records of the two herds which clearly indicate the improvement effected by the introduction of four times milking and 'handling' since 1932-33 in the case of Sahiwal herd and 1936-37 in the Tharparkar herd.

There can be no doubt that the practice of two times milking with many Indian breeds results in the country having to maintain a larger number of animals than is necessary for the production of the same amount of milk. The experimental results referred to suggest that this is not less than 47 per cent and that probably 61 per cent is a nearer figure for the Tharparkar cows under the ex- periment. In a country where labour is not an expensive item there is here a case of increased reward out of proportion to the cost of labour involved. There has been no decrease in the fat percentage in milk which has remained at about five per cent in both the herds since the introduction of four times milking. Experience in the general management of the herds in question suggests that three times milk- ing has an effect similar in manner, if not to the same degree, as four times milking. SUMMARY At the Agricultural Substation, Karnal, H. Tharparkar cows were milked four times in a day and 'haudled' i.e., udder massaged 15 to 20 days before calving and milked as secretion started, while 12 cows were milked twice a day and not 'handled'. The increase in the average yield per day for the wet period due to four times milking and handling' was 47 per cent over cows milked twice a day. The overall average and lactation yield showed 61 per cent and 74 per cent increases respectively. The calving interval for cows under four times milking was 442 days and that for cows under two times milking was 414 days. This variation was due to the slightly longer service period neces- sitated by the longer lactation period in the case of cows under four times milking. But this longer interval has not affected the overall average which was 61 per cent more than the cows milked twice daily. When the yields of cows under the two and four times milking were graphed, the latter showed a definite upward trend of the curves with each succeeding lactation and a development of flush period. Under the two times milking no development of the flush period took place, and the yield curves showed a rapid downward trend in the later lactations. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Our thanks are due to Messrs. N. P. Fernandez and S. Zahir-ud-din for their painstaking super- vision of the experiment and accurate recording of the results during their respective terms of office as Cattle Superintendents at Karnal. Special thanks are due to Mr Wynne Sayer who, as Imperial Agriculturist, introduced many new methods into the technique of management in Indian breeds of dairy cattle. The soundness of his methods has been fully demonstrated in the successful deve- lopment of the (Sahiwal and Tharparkar herds, in the latter of which, the experiment was initiated, by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, to verify by actual test his claim that Indian breeds of dairy cattle require milking more than two times daily in order to stimulate and develop their full capacity for milk yield.

THE EFFECT OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT ON THE DIGESTION OF ORGANIC NUTRI- ENTS IN FODDERS IN WHICH LIME CONTENT IS EITHER LOW OR HAS A TENDENCY OF POOR ASSIMILATION By RAMESWAR MUKHERJEE, M.Sc., Late Assistant Physiological Chemist and INDUBHUSAN CHAT- TERJEE, M.Sc. (AGR.), L. Ag., Formerly Physiological Chemist, Department of Agriculture, Bengal (Received for publication on 27 May 1946) THE study of the possible effect of a deficiency or deprivation of mineral elements on the diges- tibility and utilization of organic nutrients of feed does not seem to have received much atten- tion. Ranganathan and Rao [1938] studied the influence of calcium intake and found that an in- crease in the ingestion of calcium of rats improved both the digestibility and biological value of protein. In similar experiment Swaminathan [1931] did not observe any effect of calcium intake on the biological value of protein. Henry et al [1940] working on rats found the same value for the biological value and true digestibility at two widely different levels of calcium ingestion, viz. 0.07 per cent and 0.86 per cent calcium. Earlier work of Woodman and Evans [1930] supports the find- ing of the latter worker, and their results on sheeps showed that the digestibility of organic nutrients was not affected by the deficiency of minerals (specially calcium and phosphorous) in the feed. The investigation forming the subject matter of this paper arose from the following considera- tion. A feeding and metabolic test was initiated with Napier silage which was however found to be very poor in lime (0.29 per cent CaO on dry basis and 0.07 per cent on fresh basis). It should be noted that Napier grass is the recommended fodder from Bengal Agricultural Department and silage was made from this grass. The experiment was therefore designed with a view to see amongst others how far the addition of calcium supplement given as CaCO3 was likely to be reflected on the digestibility of organic nutrients. This represented an experiment in which the fodder was admit- tedly deficient in lime. It has been found in a series of previous trials that the lime present in rice straw has a tendency of poor assimilation. An experiment with Boro variety of rice straw with and without lime given as CaCO3 provided the material for studying their effect on the digestibility of the same nutrients. EXPERIMENTAL Both under Napier silage as well as Boro straw eight bullocks of approximately same age and ive weight were selected four being placed under 'No lime' and four under 'Lime'. The animals under 'Lime' were each given 25 gm. of CaCO3 daily. The Napier Silage was made at Dacca Farm silo pit and was fed ad lib. to all the eight animals. Linseed cake at the rate of 0.5 gm. per lb. of live weight was fed as concentrate to the silage animals. The animals were watered twice daily. The feeding lasted altogether for 50 days and the metabolic collection commenced after 29 days and continued for 13 days. In the case of Boro straw also it was fed ad lib. The concentrate given was mustard cake at the rate of 10 per cent on the straw actually consumed. The feeding lasted for a total period of 83 clays and the metabolic collection commenced after a preparatory feeding of 59 days and continued for 10 days. In both the groups common salt was given at the rate of 25 to 40 gm. per animal per day. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS It should be noted that both these experiments have been recorded in the Annual Reports of the Physiological Chemist, Bengal, for the years 1936-37 and 1938-39. A paper on the nutritive value of Boro straw also forms the subject matter of a separate communication by Chatterjee and Sarkar [1947]. 85 E

Judged, whether on the basis of combined digestibilities (Table III) or on the digestibilities of straw components (Table IV), lime feeding has definitely depressed the digesti- bility of organic matter mainly from the share of ether-extract and crude fibre. It should be noted also that unlike under Napier silage (Table I) the addition of lime supplement under Boro has not contributed in any way towards a better lime assimilation; but the effect has been well reflected in depressing the digestibility of both ether-extract and crude fibre. In so far as ether extract is concerned,THE VALUE OF BORO RICE STRAW AS A CATTLE FEED INDUBHUSHAN CHATTERJEE, M. Sc. (AGR.), L. AG., Formerly Physiological Chemist, Department of Agriculture, Bengal, and SACHINDRA NATH SARKAR, M. Sc. Ph. D. (Received for publication on 27 May 1946) IN Bengal the rice crop is known by Amon, Aus and Boro. The Amon on winter variety is harvested during winter (November to January) and the Aus variety is harvested in August- September. The Boro variety is generally a summer or spring crop. But a second or what may be called kharif crop, is also taken in some places. The summer variety is sown in seed bed in October or November, transplanted in December-January and harvested in March to June. The kharif variety is sown in seed bed in June or July, transplanted in July-August and harvested in September- October. The crop is grown by artificial irrigation in low lying lands adjoining beels, streamlets and rivers. The total area of Boro crop in Bengal is a little over 400,000 acres being about 1.75 per cent of the total rice area of the province. Of this the district of Mymensing occupies nearly half followed by Dacca (about 45,000 acres), Malda 40,000 acres, Tiperah 30,000 acres, Khulna 25,000 acres, Midnapur 17,400 acres and Rajshahi 13,500 acres. In the other districts it varies from 300 to 8,000 acres whereas the districts of Birbhum, Jalpaigury and Chittagong hill tract have no Boro area. Judged from the standpoint of the acreage it is a comparatively minor crop and is mainly distri- buted in the eastern districts, but neither the grain nor the straw can be a matter of neglect under the existing shortage of our food and fodder. The straw obtained from this crop is generally liked by animals and as will appear from the investigation on it, it compares well with other straws in its feeding values. As this crop is harvested at a time when the monsoon does not permit efficient drying, the straw suffers from somewhat greater disadvantage than that from Aus crop. There cannot be any doubt that every year a large percentage of both these straws have to pay a heavy toll to the vagaries of monsoon. Yet a considerable part of it can be saved if suitable ensiling could be adopted. Here of course great propaganda is needed to impress it on the minds of the people and also to overcome their inherent disinclination and inertia. Turning how to the experiment, the Boro straw was obtained from the riverine tracts of the Mirpur side of the Dacca district. About 200 maunds were obtained and feeding was commenced from the 30 June, 1936 and terminated on the 23 September of the same year thus lasting for about 12 weeks. Before describing the details of the experiment it may be well to examine the composition of Boro straw side by side with that of the other straws. This is given in Table I. It will be noted from Table I that the straw contains a much higher percentage of nitrogen as compared to that of Amon or Aus. It has recorded the lowest percentage of crude fibre as well as nitrogen-free extract. This has been mainly due to the fact that its mineral content (ash) is very high (Nearly 22 per cent) as compared to 11 to 16 per cent in the case of the other straws. The striking feature is that the major part of this ash consists of acid insoluble residue (over 18 per cent) so that the actual soluble matter is about the same (3.8 per cent) as in others. It is poorer in lime than both Amon and Aus, but the potash content is similar. As will be seen later it contains an. appreciable quantity of oxalic acid. Previous experiments have shown that the lime assimilation under rice straw feeding from the share of lime present in the straw is generally low. It was therefore decided to divide the feeding and digestion trails under two heads, viz. (1) with no lime and (2) with lime supplement as CaCO3. The latter was given mixed with cake at the rate of 25 gm. to each animals. Mustard cake was fed as concentrate on the basis of 10 per cent on the wieght of straw consumed. In view of the necessity of economising space it is not possible to give the various data; but may be stated that both under 'No lime' and 'Lime' groups the animals showed a definite increase in live weight. The consumption of dry matter also recorded a steady increase. As the feeding proceeded there was somewhat greater demand of water. The nature of water consumption and urination did not exhibit any difference between either. 89 F

The digestibilities of dry matter and organic matter have been slightly but definitely de- pressed. It has been still more so in the case of ether-extract and crude fibre. Moreover ether- extract has exhibited great fluctuation specially under individual values (not shown in Table II) in which one animal even recorded negative digestibility, another about one third to one-fourth of the same under 'No lime' group while still another gave very high value. The results under 'No lime' have been of a more stable nature.

The most noteworthy feature is that, compared to the other straws it possesses the highest amount of digestible protein which is necessarily reflected in a narrower nutritive ratio which approximates closely to the maintenance requirements. Another point of interest is that although in terms of T. D. N. it has recorded a lower value than both Amon and Aus, its net energy value (starch equi- valent) is almost the same. This is mainly due to its low fibre content. It will be interesting at this stage to compare the results on the basis of the performance of the animals per say 1,000 lb. live weight. These are set up in Table IV.

Consumption of feed92 The Value of Boro Rice Straw as a Cattle Feed the nutritive ratio given in Table III rather suggests that for the purpose of maintenance, concen- trates can be completely dispensed with. This is however not advisable as it has been found in other experiments that when rice straw is fed without concentrate it adversely affects economic utili- zation. But the quantity can be safely reduced to half or possibly even less. A careful feeder can adjust it after watching the effect on the animal for a short period. NITROGEN AND MINERAL METABOLISM. As all the figures connected with above will occupy large space only the digested share in the case of nitrogen and total intakes in the case of minerals are set up in Table V.

SARKAR 93 The above results show that the oxalic acid present in Boro straw is considerably more than in Aus and Amon straws and further that it is theoretically capable of rendering insoluble nearly twice the amount of lime actually present. Recent work by Talapatra et al [1942] suggests that the soluble oxalic acid is probably largely decomposed in the reumen. Nevertheless the presence of a large amount of a substance which is both toxic and precipitant of lime is an unsatisfactory feature. The experiment suggests that the lime requirement per 500 lb. live weight under Boro straw is highest (not less than 30 gm. CaO), Aus comes next with 24 to 25 gm. CaO and Amon still less (about 18 to 20 gm.). If we leave aside the unsatisfactory behaviour of lime metabolism as well as the high content of potash and oxalic acid, this straw like Aus variety is superior to Amon. Moreover it is the richest amongst all the rice straw varieties in protein content and in this respect it is even superior to Aus. It has been already pointed out that this straw contains a large percentage of insoluble siliceous matter. It means that a very large ingestion of such material is inseparable with its feeding. The trial which was conducted for a few weeks does not permit any inference as to how far a continuous feeding of this nature can have a cumulative effect. It should also be stated here that the animals were fed sodium chloride at the rate of 25 gm. of sodium chloride per animal. There was no reason for a deficiency of chlorine. In spite of it there has been a negative balance, which apart from this trial has been noticed in the experiment with a few of other samples Amon rice straws obtained from the different soil belts (specially the saline tracts). At present no explanation can be offered for such a phenomenon. SUMMARY 1. The feeding value of Boro variety of rice straw has been investigated and comparative data have been presented. 2. The experiment was conducted with 'No lime', and 'Lime'. The lime was given a calcium carbonate. The feeding of lime did not offer any advantage. On the other hand there was a depression of digestibility which was well marked in ether-extract and crude fibre, the former also exhibiting great fluctuation. 3. The main feature of this straw is a large percentage (compared to other rice straws) of protein content, a lower percentage of fibre, a very large percentage of insoluble silica and also a high per- centage of oxalic acid. 4. Like Aus rice straw, Boro rice straw is definitely superior to Amon rice straw in its nutritive value on the organic side. As it contains the highest percentage of protein compared to the other two straws, it definitely economises protein requirement and from that standpoint is superior even to Aus straw. 5. Its unsatisfactory feature is that, its oxalic acid content is highest for which its lime require- ment is highest (amongst all rice straws); and for reasons still unknown the chlorine balance has also exhibited a negative tendency besides lime, potash and phosphate which are usually so found in other rice straws. 6. Further experiments are required to devise correctives for the unsatisfactory lime, potash and chlorine metabolism as well as for high content of oxalic acid and also to see how the large quantity of insoluble siliceous matter as found in Boro straws, is likely to react on the animal system specially under a prolonged feeding.

COMPOSITION OF FREE FATTY ACIDS IN HIGH ACID GHEE By T. M. PAUL, V. R. BHALERAO, C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND M. C. RANGASWAMY, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 23 September 1946) CLARIFIED butterfat is commonly known as ghee in India and it is a very popular article of diet among the people. More than 50 per cent of all the milk produced in the country is utilized for the manufacture of ghee. Possibly due to faulty methods of manufacture, collection and storage conditions, very often ghee containing considerable amounts of free fatty acids, are come across in the market. These are often-times condemned as unfit for human consumption. During the course of an investigation into the causes of the development of acidity in ghee, it was thought interesting to know the nature of the free fatty acids present in ghee. Therefore, attempts were made to separate the free fatty acids from high acid ghee and to study their chemical composition. In India butter is mostly prepared in small amounts and accumulated for various lengths of time before converting into ghee. It is possible that acidity is produced during this storage period. It was found that butter prepared from raw milk developed acidity in a shorter time compared to butter prepared from boiled milk. Therefore, butter was prepared from raw cow's milk by the indigenous method of souring the milk by addition of small amount of starter and then churning it. This butter was kept at room temperature for about a month. By that time the butter had developed about 20.0 per cent acidity calculated as oleic acid. The butter was then melted and converted into ghee by the 'boiling off' method. About 300 gm. of this ghee was set apart to study the chemical composition. This is referred to as Sample I. The rest of the ghee was boiled with twice its weight of 95.0 per cent alcohol, and the free fatty acids neutralized with dilute alkali. After separating the residual fat (Sample II), as far as possible, the soap solution was distilled to remove most of the alcohol. The alcoholic residue was diluted with water and extracted with successive portions of ether to ensure the removal of all fat from the soap. It was then acidified with hydrochloric acid and the liberated fatty acids were extraced exhaustively with ether. The ether extracts were washed free from acids and the washings were collected (Solution K). The washed ether extracts were dehydrated, filtered and solvent (Solution Y) distilled off. The fatty acids (Sample III) were then converted into methyl esters by refluxing for one hour with 1,000 ml. of methyl alcohol containing 3 sulphuric acid. Most of the alcohol was then distilled off, the distillate made up to a known volume (Solution W) and preserved for subsequent analysis. The residue was cooled, transferred to a separating funnel and diluted with water. It was extracted exhaustively with ether. The ether extracts were washed free from acid. The washings were then mixed with solution K, made alkaline with KOH, and the volume was reduced at atmospheric pressure. The residue was acidified and steam distilled and the distillate (Solution X) titrated against 0.1 N alkali and expressed as methyl butyrate. The washed ether extracts were dehydrated filtered and solvent distilled off. (The distillate was mixed with solution Y and made to known volume). Aliquots were then taken from solution W and Y distillates and saponified with potash and the results expressed as methyl butyrate. Total of these determinations gave the amount of C4 acid originally present in the fat. The methyl esters of the fatty acids now obtained and the methyl esters prepared from samples I and II were subjected to detailed ester fractionation in an EHP column according to the method of Hilditch as modified by Smith and Dastur [1938]. The results obtained are presented in Tables I to VI. The analytical characteristics of Sample I and II are as follows: Melting Point B.R. Reading at 40°C. Sap. Equivalent Iodine Value R.M.

96 Composition of Free Fatty Acids in High-acid Ghee The data indicates that the refined sample possesses comparatively high melting point, possibly due to the presence of more of higher saturated glycerides. The iodine value in Sample II is very low indicating a reduction in the amount of unsaturated glycerides. The low R.M. value of refined sample can be attributed to the decrease in the steam volatile fatty acids. The acidity of the refined sample is negligible, confirming the complete removal of free fatty acids. From the Tables IV and V it is clear that the percentage of lower acids up to C14 for Sample I and II are 23.4 and 22.7 re- spectively. This shows that no appreciable change has taken place in the amount of lower acids except butyric acid which is reduced by 0.6 per cent due to refining. This is confirmed by the presence of higher amounts of butyric acid in the free acids as shown in Table VI. The amount of caprioc acid in both samples I and II is negligible. The sum of myristo-palmito-stearic group in Sample I is 53.0 per cent as against 62.8 in Sample II. Relatively all these acids are proportionately increased in Sample II. This is obvious as the amount of oleic acid is reduced by 9.9 per cent due to the removal of the free fatty acids from the original sample. Further, this accounts for the higher melting point of Sample II. The amount of arachidic acid in both the samples remains constant.

It must be pointed out however, that while there is little doubt (from the trend of iodine value (of the lower ester fractions) that these minor unsaturated acid components exist, their quantitative percentage must be regarded only in the nature of a general indication of their true proportions, though not far from them. Sample II also gives the same proportion of these lower unsaturated acids. Normally the free fatty acids are expressed in terms of oleic acid as this acid accounts for a large proportion of the free fatty acids. Davies [1941] from a preliminary study of the free fatty acids in high acid butterfat surmised that these are mostly composed of C16 and C18 acids, oleic acid appearing in the free form in the largest amount. The results reported herein show that the C18 and C16 acids account for 59.1 and 15.5 per cent respectively of the free fatty acids of high acid ghee, the balance being made up of other acids from C4 to C20. The sum of all the acids up to C1 is 20.8 per cent, which is a little lower than in the case of the original sample; while the C16 content is markedly lower. The sum of the myristopalmito-stearic group is only 29.7 per cent. The lower unsaturated acids are also of the same order as are found in cow ghee. The existence of other acids, besides oleic acid, in the free-fatty acids is confirmed by the Iodine Value (54.21) of Sample III. Comparing the component acids of all. the samples tested, it can, therefore, be concluded that the I
100 Composition of Free Fatty Acids in High-acid Ghee trend of the fatty acid composition of the unrefined sample is midway between the composition of the refined sample and that of the free fatty acids. SUMMARY 1. A sample of ghee (clarified cow butterfat) containing 19.13 per cent free fatty acids, the natural ghee and the free fatty acids separated from the high acid ghee were subjected to detailed ester fractionation in an E.H.P. column. 2. The high acid ghee was found to be of the same composition as normal cow butterfat. 3. The neutral ghee contained the same amount of the low molecular weight acids and more of the myristto-palmito-stearic group than in the high acid ghee. The free fatty acids contained the following percentages of the various acids, butyric=4.5, copriylic=0.8, capric=1.7, lauric=2.4, myristic=9.6, palmitic=11.7, stearic=8.4, araehidic=2.1, oleic=50.4, and other unsaturated acids=8.4.

STUDIES ON THE CURING OF POISONOUS JAWAR (SORGHUM VULGARE) PERS. By N. D.KEHAR AND S. K. TALAPATRA, Animal Nutrition Section, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 8 August 1946) JAWAR is ordinarily a nutritious and palatable fodder, but under conditions of drought, wilting and frost it developes large quantities of cyanogenetic glucosides. Benson and Subba Rao [1906], Mann [1919] and Sharma [1935] have reported several deaths of cattle due to jawar poisoning. Since jawar is grown over large areas and as the average farmer cannot afford to discard his affected crops without serious setback to his already lean fodder resources, enquiries were received from several field investigators whether poisonous jawar could in any way be fed to livestock. This investiga- tion was undertaken to find an answer to this query. EXPERIMENTAL Due to the partial failure of monsoon in 1944 prussic acid was detected in jawar plants of the Institute farm in October. This provided sufficient material for exploratory studies. Fresh samples were first tested with picrate paper according to the A.O.A.C. [1940] procedure. Having detected the presence of appreciable amounts of prussic acid qualitatively, a quantitative estimation was made by the acid titration method [A.O.A.C., 1940]. Samples of jawar containing prussic acid were then cured by different methods to evolve a technique by which prussic acid could be decomposed into innocuous constituents. Accordingly a bulk sample of jawar was brought to the laboratory immediately after cutting. The prussic acid content of the representative fresh sample was estimated and the rest of the material was treated as follows: (a) Dried in shade at room temperature varying from 25°-30°C. and prussic acid estimated at the end of (i) 24 hours, (ii) 48 hours, (iii) 5 days and (iv) 15 days. (b) Dried in the sun for eight hours and then kept in the shade at room temperature over-
102 Studies on the Curing of Poisonous Jawar Pers Table I reveals several points of interest. It may be seen that the amount of prussic acid present in the stem was comparatively more than that of leaf. Similar results were obtained on examining 12 samples from the same affected area. Bagchi and Ganguly [1941] also found stems of 16 to 36 inches long plants richer in hydrocyanic acid than the leaves. Acharya [1933], however, stated that the leaves contained more hydrocyanic acid. On drying the plant, at room temperature about 70 per cent of the prussic acid was lost after 24 hours, and 75 per cent after 48 hours. When drying was continued for five days in shade at room temperature (27° to 30°C.) the loss in the prussic acid content was 77 per cent. The plant could not be made absolutely free of prussic acid even on drying in shade for 15 days. Acharya (loc cit) also found that drying in shade had little effect on the prussic acid content. Swanson [1921], however, stated that the shade dried sorghum contained only traces of prussic acid. A remarkable loss of prussic acid was observed when the plant was dried in the sun even for short periods. Eight hours drying reduced the prussic acid by 90 per cent. Seven days drying under field conditions rendered the plant absolutely free from prussic acid. Leather [1906] found that sun-drying did not decrease the amount of cyanogenetic glucoside and Acharya (loc cit) stated that sun-drying reduced the amount of prussic acid appreciably. Chopra and Badhwar [1940] also assume that the well dried plants are not dangerous. This procedure of drying in the sun and leaving the plants out in the open at night was repeated thrice with the same results. The whole area under jawar crop was cured like this and fed to cattle without any untoward effects. An alternative method of curing was also tried by ensiling the affected plants. The fresh plants were cut into two and ensiled in two small experimental pits of 4 ft. × 4 ft. × 4 ft. Locally grown hay consisting mostly of Saccharum spontaneum (kans) was used as cover. Samples from one pit were examined after every 10 days for prussic acid. It may be seen from Table II that the plants ensiled for about a month lost the entire prussic acid content. It is likely that the increased acidity and temperature in ensiling liberates the prussic acid from its combination with the enzyme and it is subsequently decomposed.

Similar views have been expressed in the U.S.A. Veterinary Science News Letter [1944] that small amounts of cyanogenetic forage is capable of causing demyelination if repeatedly consumed. SUMMARY Attempt has been made to utilize poisonous jawar as fodder by different treatments. It has been found that drying the affected plants in the sun for seven days or ensiling for 30 days renders the plant free from prussic acid.

INVESTIGATIONS ON EVAPORATED BUFFALO MILK By C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN and ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 29 October 1945) EVAPORATED milk is condensed milk to which no extraneous sugar has been added and which has been sterilized in hermatically sealed cans. Much attention has been paid towards the study of the preparation and properties of the evaporated cow's milk, but very little work has been done on the milk of other animals. In India, buffaloes form an important source of milk and dairy products and the milk and butterfat from these animals have formed the subject of many investi- gations. However, no information regarding the suitability of buffalo's milk for condensing seems to be available. Therefore, investigations were carried out to get information as to (1) the possible method of finding out the stability of evaporated milk during sterilization and (2) the applicability of 'rapid tests' which are at present in general use (for cow's milk) for predicting the heat stability of evaporated buffalo milk. EXPERIMENTAL The main factors contributing towards the success of milk condensing are uniform behaviour of liquid milk and uniform composition. Uniform composition is important in controlling the degree of condensing aimed at, which is generally done by determining the specific gravity. The standard in Great Britain for evaporated milk is 9 per cent fat and 22 per cent solids-not-fat. This gives a Fat: S.N.F. ratio of 1:2.44 which nearly conforms to the ratio for the average composition of fluid milk and allows for a slightly lower fat content. The United States standards are lower than the above. Previous to July 1940 the minimum standards for evaporated whole milk were 8 per cent fat and 28 per cent total milk solids. In the present investigation the fat: solids-not-fat ratio aimed at is 9:22. In order to obtain this ratio in the raw milk and to facilitate the control of the degree of concentration reached later, the liquid milk is toned to 4.0 per cent fat always, unless otherwise stated. The milk used in all cases was a composite sample from the Murrah buffalo herd of the Institute farm. Milk was always taken for condensing four hours after production. Condensing was done in a pilot condensing unit manufactured by The Dairy Engineers Ltd., Edinburgh. Forewarming was effected by steam in a tinned copper kettle with revolving agitator, evaporation in a tinned copper vacuum pan, and condensation in a surface condenser. The vacuum is created by means of a wet vacuum pump. VACUUM PAN OPERATION The vacuum pan was thoroughly rinsed with water and steamed for 10 minutes. The air valves were closed, and water turned into the condenser. Then water was allowed into the vacuum pump and the pump was started. When the vacuum gauge registered over 62 cm. the valve of the milk pipe leading to the pan was closed. When the milk just filled the jacket and when it touched the steam coil in the pan, steam was turned into it. When all the milk was drawn into the pan the inlet was closed and the steam pressure in the jacket was increased gradually and taken up to 22 lb. in about 6 minutes. The temperature of the vacuum pan was maintained between 122 to 128°F. If the inside temperature of the pan was increased more than 128°F. initially, milk would begin to froth too much and might even be carried on to the condenser. Therefore, the steam pressure in the jacket should be carefully controlled. It has been found by various trials that a steam pressure of 22 lb. in the coils was quite suitable for condensing the milk. The temperature of the outlet water from the condenser ranged from 110 to 115°F. Just before the desired concentration was reached (judged by looking through the man-hole) a sample was drawn out from the pan and its specific gravity determined at a temperature of 110°F. When the specific gravity was about 1.066, the steam pressure in the jacket and the coils was reduced, the vacuum break opened, the vacuum pump and the steam in the jacket were stopped. The condensed milk is then drawn out of the pan and cooled to room temperature 72.76°F. After standardization to the desired composition, the evaporated milk was filled in 8 oz. sterile vent hole cans, or in sterile glass bottles plugged with cotton wool and used for sterilization studies. 105 L
106 Investigation on Evaporated Buffalo Milk Forty lb. of standardized milk was used for condensing purposes and it generally took 20 to 25 minutes to complete one batch. STERILIZATION Sterilization was always carried out in an autoclave within two hours after condensation. The 'coming up' time, i.e. raising the temperature of the autoclave from room temperature to 240.8°F. or 248°F. was always adjusted between 20 to 25 minutes. The time taken from starting the heat- ing of the autoclave to the point of filling steam was generally 10 to 14 minutes, and from this time the heating was carefully done to raise it to the required pressure and temperature, and in no case were the above limits relaxed. After holding the samples at various temperatures and for different lengths of time, cooling was effected in such a way that the samples came to room temperature in 20 minutes. In order to make the results as nearly comparable as possible it was necessary to choose an arbitrary rate of time at which to raise the temperature of the sterilizer to the temperature at which sterilization is to be effected. Effect of concentration on the temperature of coagulation of evaporated buffalo milk Forty lb. of milk toned to 4 per cent fat was taken for condensing and evaporated to various concentration. Not more than one sample of any two concentrations was prepared on the same day. Concentrations ranging from 18 to 22 per cent solids-not-fat were tried. For each concentration two samples on two different days were prepared. If the concentration exceeds the requirement, dilution was effected by distilled water. All milk samples were forewarmed to 203ºF. for 5 minutes before concentration. Specific gravity, fat percentage and alcohol test of the raw milk were taken. The titrable acidity of the milk was expressed as percentage of lactic acid, the titration having been made with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide with phenolphthalcin as indicator. The specific gravity, fat percentage, total solids and acidity of the concentrated milk were also taken. Sterilization of the evaporated milk was effected in 8 oz. vent hole cans. The coming-up period was 30 minutes in all cases. Duplicate samples of the two concentrations prepared on the same day were sterilized at temperatures 240.8, 244.4, 248.0, 251.6, and 257°F. for 30 minutes and the coagulation, if any, was observed. The results of these experiments are presented in Table I.

P. ANANTAKRISHNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA 107 In general it can be concluded from Table I that as the concentration of the milk solid increases the temperature of coagulation for 30 minute sterilization decreases progressively, but there was no definite relationship between concentration and the change of coagulation temperature. A 22 per cent S.N.F. sample could be sterilized without coagulation between 237.2 to 244.4°F. for 30 minutes, but a few samples of 22 per cent S.N.F. which were not recorded in the table, coagulated even at 233.6°F. Effect of various temperatures of sterilization on the time of coagulation of evaporated milk Buffalo milk toned to 4 per cent fat was forewarmed at 203°F. for 5 minutes and condensed to 22 per cent S.N.F. The product was transferred to glass bottles and sterilized for various lengths of time at 233.6, 237.2, 240.8, 244.4, and 248.0°F. Four samples were tried at each temperature and the results are presented in Table II. TABLE II Time temperature relationship in the sterilization of evaporated buffalo milk Sterilization temperature °F Time of coagulation in minutes Sample No. 1 2 3 4 Average 248.0 15 10 15 15 13.8 244.4 30 15 15 25 18.8 240.8 25 30 20 25 25.0 237.2 35 35 40 35 35.0 233.6 40 40 25 35 35.0 It can be seen from Table II that as the temperature of sterilization decreases the time required for coagulation increases for the product having 22 per cent S.N.F. The average time of coagula- tion for an evaporated milk of 22 per cent S.N.F. at 240.8°F. is about 25 minutes. The acidity of the samples of milk used in the above experiments ranged between 0.12 to 0.14 per cent. Six samples having 0.15 per cent acidity were found to coagulate at 233.6°F. in 25 minutes. Effect of temperature of forewarming on the time of coagulation of the evaporated milk The temperature and the time of forewarming of milk are known to have considerable effect on the heat coagulation of evaporated milk. Webb and Holm [1932] have shown that the concen- tration of S.N.F. is important in determining the effect of temperature and time of heating on heat coagulation. They conclude that forewarming at high temperatures lowers the stability of samples with high concentrations of S.N.F. It is also known that heating a milk to boiling prior to its eva- poration strikingly increases the heat stability of its evaporated product. With a view to study the effect of forewarming on the stability of buffalo milk, various forewarming temperatures were tried. Buffalo milk toned to 4.0 per cent fat was forewarmed to 105, 185, and 203°F. respectively for five minutes and evaporated to 22.0 per cent S.N.F. and the time of coagulation at 240.8°F. was noted. Four samples were used at each forewarming temperature. The results of these experi- ments arel presented in Table III. Table III shows that, as the temperature of forewarming increases, the time of coagulation at 240.8°F. increases. All the four samples which were not forewarmed at all curdled at 240.8°F. in less than five minutes. Forewarming definitely increases the heat stability of the evaporated buffalo milk and heating at 203°F. for five minutes is comparatively better than lower temperatures of forewarming. There is no marked physical thickening of the product prepared from milk fore- warmed at 203°F. for five minutes, on storage for about three months. It was also of interest to L2

Milk was considered alcohol positive when a precipitate appears with equal parts (2 ml.) of milk and 74 per cent alcohol. The ± point was taken as positive to 74 per cent alcohol and negative to 68 per cent alcohol. When negative to 68 per cent alcohol the milk was considered alcohol negative. The method of Ramsdell et al [1931] was adopted for the phosphate test. Ten ml. of milk sample were taken in a test tube of approximately 20 ml. capacity and one ml. of phosphate solution (68.1 gm. of mono basic potassium phosphate in one litre of water) was added to it. The contents of the tube were then mixed and the tubes immersed in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. The tubes were then removed, cooled and the mixture examined for the presence of curd. Any visible coagulation indicated that the concentrated product would be of a low heat stability. Twenty-five trials were conducted with farm produced milk having acidity ranging from 0.12 and 0.15 per cent and the results are presented in Table V.

Fresh samples of evaporated milk containing 22.0 per cent S.N.F. were inoculated with these spores and organisms before sterilization and heated to 248°F. for 20 minutes. After this process, the samples were incubated for 3 days at 98.6°F. to find out whether they survive or not. None of these samples were found to be sterile. In another trial the time of holding at 248°F. was increased to 30 minutes and then the samples incubated as before. It was found that these samples were practically sterile. But the holding time of 30 minutes at 248°F. for evaporated milk with a 22.0 per cent S.N.F. was found to be too much for this reason, that the final product curdled in the sterilizer. So, when these heat resistant spores get into milk, which is to be used for the manufacture of evaporated milk, the only way of getting at a wholesome sterile product is found to be, to concentrate the milk to only 19 per cent S.N.F. and sterilize at 248°F. for 30 minutes. But, this procedure would give a final product satisfying only the U. S. Standards for evaporated milk. SUMMARY The suitability of buffalo milk for the manufacture of evaporated milk was investigated. It has been found, that as the concentration of the milk solids increases, the temperature of coagulation of the evaporated milk for 30 minutes sterilization decreases progressively. For a product having 22.0 per cent solids-not-fat, as the temperature of sterilization decreases the time required for coagulation increases. With milk containing 22.0 per cent S.N.F. the temperature of forewarming influences the time of coagulation. A five minutes forewarming at 203°F. was found to be the most suitable for buffalo milk. The alcohol test was found to be more reliable than the phosphate test in predicting the heat stability of evaporated buffalo milk. Stabilizers like di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium citrate increase the heat stability of evaporated buffalo milk. REFERENCES Ramsdell, Johnson and Evans (1931). J.

NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RAW AND BOILED MILKS OF COWS AND BUFFALOES By R. P. SINGH, V. R. BHALERAO and C. P.ANANTAKRISHNAN, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 11 September 1946) (With one text-figure) IN India, different methods are adopted for processing milk. For house-hold consumption milk in some parts of India is brought to boil and allowed to simmer for about ten minutes before consumption. In certain other parts of the country, it is common to continue boiling for longer periods or even allow milk to simmer for over such long intervals as 10-12 hours. It is, therefore, of great importance from the point of view of human nutrition to determine whether any dimnu- tion in the nutritive value of milk of either cow or buffalo is brought about by boiling. In foreign countries where a large proportion of milk is pasteurized the question as to whether or not heat treatment seriously diminishes the nutritive value of milk has been exhaustively studied. A large number of investigations are reported and the results are summarized by Stirling and Blackwood [1933] and Kon [1934]. It is generally concluded that pasteurization does not materially affect the nutritive value of milk. In holder pasteurization method, milk is not taken over 145°F. and the question arises whether taking milk to boiling temperature or simmering it as is usually done in our country, affects the nutritive value of milk. Henry et al [1938] studied the effect of com- mercial sterilization on the nutritive value of milk and found that there were no differences in the growth promoting values of milks. The rats on sterilized milk consumed it more readily than their mates on raw milk. Mitra [1942] studied the growth promoting and biological values of procins of raw cow and buffalo milk and concluded that there was no difference in their growth promoting values. In the present investigation, the common method of processing milk namely boiling for ten minutes has been adopted to determine the effect of heat treatment on the nutritive value of milks of cow and buffaloes. EXPERIMENTAL Raw milk was collected daily for the feeding experiments from the whole bulk of cow and buffalo milks from the herd of the Imperial Dairy Research Institute. A part of the sample was heated to boiling and simmered for about ten minutes, taking care not to allow any skin to be formed on the surface by keeping the liquid continuously stirred. It was then cooled taking the same precau- tion. The buffalo milk was toned with separated milk to the same fat percentage as cow milk before heating. To study the nutritive value, the technique of Henry and Kon [1937] was adopted. Young rats were weaned when 21 days old and placed in experimental cages when 28 days old. Twelve male litter mates from 12 animals were used for each group and were fed exclusively on raw or boiled cow or buffalo milk, supplemented with minerals. Iron was supplied in the form of ferric chloride, and copper and manganese as sulphates. The minerals were administered per animal per day as follows: First week114 Nutritive value of raw and boiled Milks [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] FIG. 1.

They were in good flesh, their coats were smooth and their eyes bright. It will be readily seen from Fig. 1 that rats fed on different milks show almost the same rate of growth. The animals receiving cow milk had grown a little better but the gain was not statistically significant. As seen from Tables I, II, III and IV, the differences in daily gains in weight made by rats fed on different milks are negligible. The efficiency of utilization of milk as measured by the gain in weight per 100 ml. of milk was also same for all the groups. The figures for milk consumption further revealed that there was no difference in the appetite of the rats in the various groups. Thus it is seen from the results of the experiment that boiling either cow or buffalo milk for about ten minutes had no appreciable effect on their growth promoting values. When the body lengths of the rats fed on these milks are taken into considera- tion after killing it was found that the mean body length of the rats on boiled buffalow milk was slightly less (by about 4.5 mm.) than those on either raw buffalo milk, raw cow milk or boiled cow milk. This slight difference, however, does not appear to be of any special significance. N
118 Nutritive Value of Raw and Boiled Milks SUMMARY The male rats were fed ad libitum for a period of eight weeks on raw and boiled milks of cows and buffaloes supplemented with minerals. No differences were observed in the growth promoting values under the conditions of boiling, viz., allowing the milk to simmer for ten minutes.

DETECTION OF ADULTERATION OF MILK WITH MILK POWDER By K. N. SHAMA SASTRY and NOSHIR N. DASTUR, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 5 August 1946) IN normal times cheap skim-milk powder is available and this is used freely in certain urban centre to tone whole milk rich in. fat. If the milk powder solution is prepared carefully and tonning so carried out that the final product conforms to the legal standard for fat percentage in milk, this tonning cannot be detected by the routine methods normally used for testing milk. Nutritionally such tonning is not objectionable but there is no doubt that the product cannot be regarded as genuine milk. Further, such a practice has graver effects on the genuine liquid milk market than are apparent at first sight and requires to be curbed by all available means. The problem of adulteration of milk with milk powder is peculiar to the urban centres in India. Studies have been, therefore, undertaken to find simple methods which will prove useful under house- hold conditions and the laboratory. The results of these studies are given below. Experimental 1. Milk powders used Three brands of milk powders were used, viz., spray-dried skim-milk powder (New Zealand) ; roller-dried skim milk powder (Benares) ; and roller-dried whole milk powder (Benares). Solutions of different powders were prepared as follows : (i) Spray-dried skim-milk powder. Skim-milk powder, 9.5 gm., was sprinkled over 90 ml. of water (40ºC.), shaken for a minute and filtered through muslin. The fat percentage of this solution was 0.1 per cent and the solids-not-fat content 8.4-8.5 per cent. (ii) Roller-dried skim-milk powder. A quantity. 9.0 gm., of the powder were sprinkled over 90 ml. of water (60ºC.), shaken for one minute, cooled and filtered through muslin. The fat percentage of the reconstituted skim-milk was 0.25 per cent and the S. N. F. varied from 8.4-8.5 per cent. (iii) Roller-dried whole milk powder. Whole milk powder. 10.2 gm., was sprinkled over 90 ml. of water (60ºC), shaken for a minute, cooled and filtered. The fat percentage of this solution varied from 1.4-1.6 per cent and the S. N. F. from 8.4-8.5 per cent. In all cases it was aimed to get S. N. F. of about 8.5 per cent and so the quantity of powder to be used was varied accordingly. 2. Preparation of tonned milk For preparing tonned milk, the fat percentage of fresh whole buffalo milk was brought to 4.0 per cent and that of fresh whole cow milk to 3.5 per cent by adding appropriate amount of respective milk powder solutions. 3. Tests tried (i) Stability to heat. Pure samples of milk, both raw and boiled can easily be distinguished from similar samples of milk powder by their odour. However, such distinction could not be made so easily with tonned samples. Hence trials were carried out by incubating the samples for different lengths of time at 37ºC. This temperature was selected as facilities are usually available for main- taining it in all public health laboratories. In a series of experiments samples of milk and tonned milk, 50 ml. in glass stoppered bottles, were kept at 37ºC. The flavour was compared at intervals of an hour over a period of eight hours. It was found that under these conditions tonned milk samples developed a peculiar burnt flavour which characterised them from other samples. This flavour became very pronounced after four hours incubation and longer intervals did not seem to make much difference in the intensity of flavour. This observation was made both with cow and buffalo tonned milks. In the above experiments it was found that to distinguish tonned milk from pure milk, it was necessary to have samples of raw milk for comparison. Due to the development of acidity during incubation the burnt flavour in tonned milk became slightly masked. To overcome this, tests were 119 O

124 Detection of Adulteration of Milk with Milk Powder carried out as described above but before incubating a drop of formalin was added. By this modification of the test, the distinction between tonned and pure samples became very sharp and tonned milk could be detected without the slightest ambiguity. In practice this test has proved to be the simplest and the most sensative test of those tried for distinguishing milk tonned with milk powder. (ii) Rennet test. For this test 50 ml. of milk were brought to 37ºC. and 1 ml. of 10 per cent Hansen's liquid rennet added, while stirring. The time when flakes first appear was noted. Preliminary studies showed that diluting the milk under test with distilled water helped to differ entiate between pure and tonned milk. Hence this method was adopted for all the studies described below. The results in detail are given in Table I to VI. The figures 0, 15, 30, etc., in the heading of the Table represent the percentage of distilled water added to milk (V/V).

There was a great variation in results obtained from the same class of animals on different days and hence it was not possible to differentiate between cow and buffalo milk from individual figures. It may further be added that the studies reported here were carried out with farm produced milk and it is quite likely that market samples will give higher values for dry residue than those recorded. Compared to raw cow and buffalo milk, milk powder solutions give much higher values. The average for spray dried skim- milk powder was 0.34 per cent. Tonning raw milk invariably gives a higher figure. When roller dried milk powders are used tonning can be detected without any difficulty as the percentage of dry residue increases from less than 0.05 per cent to nearly 0.5 per cent. When spray dried powder is used the percentage of dry residue does increase but the demarca- tion is not so sharp. For guidance it is suggested that if the percentage of residue is greater than 0.11 per cent the possibility of the sample being tonned may be tentatively assumed and confirmed by the following further tests : (a) The dry residue may be estimated on the sample after it has been boiled. It has been found that milk samples give a higher percentage of residue after boiling. On the contrary tonned milk (as well as spray dried skim milk powder) shows the reverse, i.e., on boiling the amount of residue usually decreases, probably due to the fact that on boiling some more of the residue goes into solution. (b) The dry residue is subjected to the xantho-protein reaction. The residue is dissolved in 2-5 ml. concentrated nitric acid, diluted with 5 ml. of water and then 2.5 ml. liquor ammonia added. It was observed that the residue from pure milk gives a solution with a yellow colour, milk powder residue gives a deep orange solution, while tonned milk samples give a colour varying from light orange to orange. The results are given in Table XI.

Freezing point determination b. Microscopic study c. Methylene blue reduction test d. Resazurin test, and e. Estimation of total minerals None of these tests helped to clearly differentiate between various samples of milk and hence detailed results are not given here. SUMMARY The following nine methods were tried for differentiating genuine milk from tonned milk : (1) Stability to heat (2) Coagulation with rennet after dilution with water (3) Estimation of dry residue (4) Xanthoprotein reaction with dry residue (5) Freezing point (6) Microscopic study (7) Methylene blue reduction test (8) Resazurin test, and (9) Estimation of total minerals Studies have been carried out using spray dried skim-milk powder, roller dried skim-milk powder and roller dried whole milk powder. Amongst the tests tried microscopic study, methylene blue test, resazurin test, freezing point and estimation of total minerals have proved of little value. The odour of samples after incubation for four hours at 37°C. provides the simplest and a very reliable test. Incubation is carried out after adding a drop of formalin to suppress the development of lactic acid odour. This test can be done under house-hold conditions. The rennet test after diluting the milk sample with distilled water is another simple test and the results can be obtained in a short time. Tonned milk takes a much longer time to coagulate. Cow and buffalo milk are found to differ to some extent in their behaviour towards rennet. Cow milk takes a longer time and also the time of coagulation markedly increases on dilution with water. The estimation of dry residue is another test which will prove useful. It is likely that the figures for dry residue obtained in the present studies may require some modification when working with market samples. The results of this test are further confirmed by the xanthoprotein reaction with the dry residue. Pure milk gives a yellowish coloured solution, whilst tonned milk samples give an orange colour.

STUDIES ON THE HAEMOTOLOGY OF DOGS IN HEALTH AND WHEN INJEC- TED WITH BABESIA GIBSONI (PATTON 1910) By B. M. PRASAD, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 14th October 1946) THE purpose of the present investigation was to obtain precise data on the total red and white cell counts, the differential white cell counts and the haemoglobin content of the blood of dogs in health and when suffering from piroplasmosis due to infection with Babesia gibsoni. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three healthy pariah dogs were used. To obtain the normal blood picture, seventeen counts were made on ten other healthy dogs and the results obtained were more or less in agreement with those obtained with the three original dogs at different periods prior to infective inoculation. The dogs were obtained from Almora in the Kumaon hills and their age ranged from two to four years and body weight from twentyfive to thirty pounds. Two of the three animals were artificially infected with a laboratory strain of B. gibsoni and the other served as a control. Towards the close of the experiment this dog, too, was given a dose of infected blood to see if it was susceptible to the disease and a fatal piroplasmosis resulted. The injections were given subcutaneously with the idea that the disease might develop as under natural conditions ; the disease is known to be transmitted from one animal to another by the tick Haemaphysalis bispinosa. The animals were housed together and kept on an uniform diet consisting of ½ lb. of cooked beef and chapattis given in one meal in the afternoon ; but during the acute stage of the disease the affected dogs refused solid food and were then given either milk or soup. The shed was a hundred yards from the laboratory, this distance was traversed twice daily by the dogs and constituted their daily exercise. When the illness was advanced, they were unfit to walk, and remained indoors with the control animals. Blood samples were always drawn at the fixed time of day (10 A.M.) Both the dogs took the infection and it is interesting to note that while in one, the disease was fatal in about 16 days after the first appearance of the parasites in the blood, in the other, it was chronic and the animal apparently recovered. All samples of blood were collected from the marginal ear-vein or the external Sephana vein, as between these two sites there was no difference in the blood picture. The area where the puncture was to be made was cleaned with cotton wool and alcohol, rubbing being continued for about one minute. When the alcohol had evaporated, a puncture was quickly made with a thin sterilized hypodermic needle and after rejecting the first two or three drops, the blood was taken up in a capillary pipette direct from the puncture. For red cell counts the blood was diluted. 200 times in a potain pipette (0.5136 Study on the Haematology of Dogs in Health was made and the first drop that oozed out without squeezing was taken up on a slide and spread over another as rapidly and uniformly as possible. Giemsa stain gave good results. Immature cells of lymphoblastic and myeloblastic origin were differentiated by the oxydase reaction in freshly- prepared-blood smears. For this purpose the method recommended by Piney [1931] was generally followed. Films, immediately after air-drying were put in a glass stoppered jar containing 2 per cent osmic acid and allowed to stand for 30 seconds for complete fixation. They were then washed thoroughly with distilled water and stained for 10 minutes with a mixture of equal parts of 1 per cent solutions of alpha-naphthol and paraphenylenediamine. They were then washed in distilled water and mounted without drying in water glass, oxydase granules being stained blue. For the actual content of the leucocytes the smears were mounted and examined by the method known as the 'Four field meander, technique, and Arneth Index was taken for neutrophiles. EXPERIMENTAL From Table I it may be observed that compared with figures reported by various workers else- where the average erythrocyte count per c.mm. of blood in the experimental dogs is within the normal range of variation.

Morphological studies and haemoglobin estimations were made of the blood of these animals before infection and also during the disease. In the two infected dogs the readings did not change significantly during the incubation period. For comparative purposes seventeen (17) counts were made on the blood of 10 apparently healthy pariah dogs with results similar to those obtained in the case of the experimental dogs before infec- tion was established. In the two infected dogs the red cell count fell to about one million per c.mm. during the disease. The white cell count increased to a peak at nearly 80,000 per c.mm. and this was followed by a gradual decrease to almost normal level, irrespective of whether the disease ended in death or recovery. The differential white cell count showed during a period of marked leucocytosis a mild neutrophilia, slight lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and a shift to the left of the neutrophiles and this was followed by a moderate monocytosis. During the disease the average haemoglobin content dropped to 12.5 per cent from normal. The outstanding features of B. gibsoni infection in dogs are the decrease in total red cell count and the marked fall in haemoglobin due to a certain extent to rapid destruction of the red cells, but more to the failure of formative tissues.

STUDY ON THE VITAMIN A ACTIVITY OF CAROTENE IN GREEN FODDER By B. C. ROY SARKAR and K. C. SEN, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, and Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore, India (Reprinted from Journal of Agricultural Science, Vol. 36, Part 2, April 1946) IN some recent papers, Seshan and Sen (1942 a.b.c.d) described a modified technique for extracting carotene from different feeding stuffs and utilized it for the study of carotene in plants including some balance experiments with ruminants. It was pointed out by the authors that the term carotene was used in the ordinary sense denoting the epiphasic pigment, and no chromatographic study was made of the time. As such, the carotene figures for materials like old stored hay straw, silage and cattle faeces were liable to revision because of the production of non-carotene pigments not removable by phase separation with 90 per cent methyl alcohol used in the method, but it was felt that no sub- stantial error was likely to be caused in the case of green fodders. It was, however, decided to check up the method by simultaneously carrying out a biological and chromatographic assay of the carotene contained in the feeding stuffs. The results obtained are being presented below, and based on these, the Seshan-Sen method of extraction of carotene has been combined with chromatographic adsorption for the routine analysis of vitamin A-active carotene in feeding stuffs. While these data were being written up, Austin and Shipton [1944] published a critical examination of the methods of determin- ing carotene and came to the conclusion that, of the variety of methods designed for the extraction of carotene, that proposed by Seshen and Sen was the most satisfactory, being decidedly more efficient and more widely applicable than the process recommended by Peterson, Hughes and Freeman [1937]. Austin and Shipton have suggested the use of 'heavy' magnesia for the chromatographic separation of non-carotene pigments in conjunction with slightly modified Seshan-Sen method of extraction. Although a fair amount of work has been done by different investigators on the determination of carotene for evaluating theoretically the vitamin A potency of stock feeds, there are comparatively few data on the relation between the carotene content and the vitamin A potency of those materials as measured biologically. Woods, Shaw, Atkeson and Johnson (1932), Woods, Atkeson, Wellhonsen and Johnson (1935a), Woods, Atkeson, Shaw, Slater and Johnson (1935b), Woods, Atkeson, Slater, Arndt, and Johnson (1935c) and Archibald, Bennett and Pitchie (1943) determined the biological potency of certain grasses, but their carotene content was not simultaneously estimated. The work of Taylore, Russell and Bender (1939) on the carotene content and vitamin A potency of different types of silage, and that of Hodgson, Murer and Knott [1939] on green, dehydrated and sun cured pea vines and pea vine silage, etc., may also be mentioned, although some of the results obtained are of questionable value. In the case of green vegetables and other plant foods, some work by different workers is on record. Felice and Fellers [1937] obtained a factor 1.7 for converting the carotene values of fresh, frozen, canned and dehydrated samples of spinach into the vitamin A potency. Gorter and Spruyt (1939) reported that some foodstuffs were found to contain less pro- vitamin A by the rat test than that obtained by chemical analysis. Stimson, Tressler and Maynard [1939] found the ratio of vitamin A potency to carotene to be 1.5 in the case of fresh and frosted peas. Smith and Otis (1941) pointed out the ralative inefficiency of yellow vegetables, notably carrot when compared with green sources. Greaves [1942] observed that carotene of vegetables seems to be less effective biologically than vitamin A and the vitamin A activity per unit of carotene was much greater in spinach, water cress and alfalfa than in carrots. Zimmerman, Tressler and Maynard [1940, 1941] found that much of the pigment of Golden Cross Bantam Sweet Corn was not carotene, while the vitamin A activity of asparagus was solely due to ß-carotene and that of green lima bean due to two thirds ß-carotene one-third 140 Study on the Vitamin A Activity of Carotene in Green Fodder EXPERIMENTAL (1) Relation between the chemically determined carotene and its biological potency as assayed against standard carotene. The experimental part consisted mainly of (a) determination of the carotene content of some green fodders by the Seshan-Sen technique, and (b) the bio-assay of the same materials by using Coward's curative methods [1938] with albino rats. The basal diet for the rats consisted of vitamin A-free casein 18, dried brewer's yeast 10, dextrinized starch 63, purified coconut oil 5 and MaCollum, Simmonds and Pitz salt mixture 4 parts respectively. Ten units of calciferel in coconut oil solution were given per os to each animal once a week. Five to ten animals were used in each group (negative control, positive control, and test group). The standard of reference was a sample of B.D.H. carotene, the purity of which was determined spectrographically [Morton, 1942] and a solution containing 10 mg. of true carotene in 50 c.c. of coconut or olive oil was prepared using 5 mg. of hydroquinone as antioxidant, and this was kept in the dark at a low temperature. Carotene was stable in both these oils for a long period and this served as stock solution from which weekly dilutions were made for administering carotene to the positive control animals daily. The methods of dosing the test material was first to dry quickly the green fodders in a current of air at a temperature not exceeding 62°C. It was found that the carotene content was not affected if the whole plant or leaves were dried in this way, but there was some loss if the plants were chopped up so as to disintegrate some of the material and expose the contents to atmospheric oxidation. The dry material was then ground to a fine powder, analysed for its carotene content, and then mixed with a small amount of vitamin A-free casein and fed to individual rats quantitatively before the basal ration was given to them. This ensured a quantitative intake of the fodder carotene. In the case of barley extract, the carotene was extracted by petroleum ether after the usual alkali alcohol digestion, evaporated to dryness, dissolved in a small amount of oil and then fed to experimental animals. The growth experiments were conducted for 4 weeks after the test animals reached a constant weight on the vitamin A-free basal ration. The dosing of the positive control and the test group of animals was so arranged by preliminary experiments that almost equal growth was obtained during the assay.

B. C. ROY SARKAR AND K. C. SEN 141 a summary of the results obtained is given. It will be obvious from a perusal of the results given in the Table that the biological value of the carotene in green fodders or that in an extract of green fodder as determined by the Seshan-Sen chemical methods is almost identical with that of pure carotene standardized by spectrographic analysis. In other words, it is possible to assay the biological potency of different green fodders by the chemical method only, provided we allow the same margin of error as is inherent in the biological technique. According to Coward (1933), the biological assay of a test material with male rats over a period of 4 weeks after the depletion period may give rise to an error of +19 or 142 Study on the Vitamin A Activity of Carotene in Green Fodder TABLE II Percentage of true carotene in apparent carotene Source By chromato- graphy of apparent carotene By chromato- graphy of total carotenoids Standard carotene . . . . . . . . . . . . . 98.95 ..

It will also be noticed that on heavy green fodder ingestion, the true carotene content of faeces from bullocks is as high as 80 per cent of the apparent carotene excreted. This means that it would be diffi- cult to differentiate between the chemically estimated carotene in faeces of animals fed a heavy green ration and that assayed biologically, which has actually proved to be the case. In other words the whole of the excreted carotene appears to be biologically active because of the margin of error inherent in biological assay. On the other hand when cattle are kept on mainly dry roughage, the faeces contain much less of true carotene, as shown by chromatographic and biological assay. The observed negative balance of carotene in the case of ruminants on carotene-low rations, as described in a pre- vious paper [Seshan and Sen, 1942 d], thus loses much of its significance. It may be mentioned that according to Russell, Taylor, Walker and Polskin [1942] no resorption of body carotene into the alimentary canal takes place in the case of hens. An alkali and alcohol digestion of feeding stuffs should, therefore, be followed by chromatographie adsorption to give a true idea of the bio- active carotene present. (3) Absorption of fodder carotene in avitaminotic rats Although the chemical, chromatographic and biological methods of a assaying carotene in green fodders have given similar results, it was of interest to determine if the activity manifested in the biological assay was really due to the absorption of the total amount of carotene ingested and to what extent the amount absorbed was converted into vitamin A in the system. It has been reported recently by Ramasarma and Hakim [1942] that 10-15 per cent of carotene fed to rats at 1-2 µg. level of dosage is excreted viâ the faeces. It is also known that vitamin A is generally utilized better than carotene [Booher and Callison, 1939; Booher, Callison and Hewston, 1939; Guilbert, Howelt and Hart, 1940; Smith and Otis, 1941 ; Treichler, Kemmerer and Fraps; 1942; Guggenheim, 1944]. To obtain an idea of the fate of the ingested carotene, some absorption studies were carried out. From a sufficiently large quantity of faeces of the rats under various test groups and the positive controls, carotene was estimated separately according to the method of Seshan and Sen, with an additional step of cooling down the final extract to 0°C, before dehydration over anhydrous sodium

It was found that even without any carotene supplements there was a basal excretion of 0.22 µg. per animal per day. But this pigment was not carotene as it had not typical selective absorption in the visual region of the spectrum. The apparent excretion of carotene on various supplements at 1-2 µg. level of dosage varied from 40 to 52 per cent in the case of both the standard of reference and that supplied from the fodders. A biolgical assay of this faecal pigment showed about 25 per cent active carotene, so that the true carotene excretion was 10-13 per cent of the original ingestion. It might be mentioned here that livers of animals re- ceiving various carotene supplements were free from reserves of vitamin A as tested by the antimony reaction. Probably the absorbed carotene from the various sources was equally utilized. (4) Relative efficiency of the standard carotene and preformed vitamin A This was studied essentially by assaying the standard carotene, which has been shown to be quite as potent as the green fodder carotene, against cod-liver oil, standardized by the spectrographic method [Coward, 1938]. E 1%1c.m328 mµ was taken to be 1600. The results of the bio-assays are given in Table III. It is evident from the data that the standard carotene was half as active as an equal weight of vitamin A. As the ratio of the growth rate on fodder carotene to that on standard TABLE III Relative efficiency of standard carotene and cod-liver oil Vitamin A at minimal levels of dosage No of assay Date of assay Growth rate per week (g) Vitamin A at 1 µg. level of dosage Carotene at 2 µg. level of dosage 1 5. 5. 43 (summer) . . . . . . . . . . . 9.33 8.98 2 4. 1. 43 (winter). . . . . . . . . . . 8.08 8.38 Average . 8.76 8.68 cartotene varied from 0.95 to 1.08 (average 1.01), the vitamin A equivalence of a microgram of the different fodder carotene varied from 0.48 to 0.54 µg. giving an average of 0.51 µg. (Table I). A similar relationship has been observed by other workers. It may be pointed out here that separate analyses showed no trace of vitamin A in the faeces and livers of the cod-liver oil-fed groups of rats. It might be presumed that both carotene and vitamin A were completely utilized after absorption if no change into inactive forms took place anywhere in the process of digestion and assimilation. On this basis, the efficiency of transformation of ß-carotene into vitamin A can be calculated as follows. Taking into consideration the fact that the standard of reference was composed of 80 per cent ß- and 20 per cent 144 Study on the Vitamin A Activity of Carotene in Green Fodder 2. Biological tests have shown that the chemical method of assay is a fair index of the true carotene content in green fodders, and carotene in the form of an extract is quite as effective in the system as that present in the plant tissues. ß-carotene appears to be predominant in these materials. 3. Carotene in green fodders as estimated chemically is about 85-98 per cent pure as shown by chromatographic adsorption through dicalcium phosphate, whereas in other roughages a consider- able part is non-carotene in nature. 4 Faecal excretion of true carotene by rats at 1-2 µg. level of dosage is shown to be 10-13 per cent according to the biological method, although the apparent excretion is as high as 40-52 per cent 5. When standard carotene is compared biologically with cod-liver oil vitamin A, the former is found to be only about half as active as an equal weight of the latter. On this basis, the vitamin A value of the various green fodders is only half of their true carotene contents. REFERENCE Archibald, J.G. Bennett, E. and Ritchis, W.S. (1943). J. Agric.

TECHNIQUE is given of preparation and dosage of a modified Waldmann's vaccine. Production is in three stages, (a) preparation of virus, (b) preparation of aluminium hydroxide solution, (c) facture of vaccine. (a) Infective epithelium from guinea pigs is ground finely in buffer solution pH 7.6 and paper filtered. The filtrate is diffused under the dorsal lingual epithelium of susceptible cattle. After 24 hours the whole epithelium over the inoculated area is pelled off and placed in a freezer. When frozen solid, it is passed through a fine meat grinder, freshly distilled water is added in amount of three to one, and the mixture centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 5 minutes. After drawing off the super- natant, distilled water equal to four times the original amount of epithelium is added to the sediment and the mixture is ground. This process is repeated once. The resulting solution of virus in the amount of eleven times the quantity of original epithelium is passed through Seitz Filters, first size 5 and then size 6. (b) To prepare 20 litres of hydroxide solution, (1) 20 litres of water are warmed to 63°C. and 880 gm. of ammonium sulphate added. (2) 1500 gm. of aluminium ammonium sulphate are dissolved in 4 litres of water. (3) Solutions of steps (1) and (2) are mixed and 2 litres of cold ammonia added.

(Received for publication on 8 May 1947) (One text-figure) IN INDIA, as in other countries, brucellosis usually exists within a herd in the form of a con- tinuous infection punctuated by sporadic abortions occurring singly or in groups. Such low- grade enzootics are seen in nearly all Indian farms and many villages of the peninsula and usually produce an unending trickle of abortions of 1 to 5 per cent in the year. From time to time, how- ever, these infections exacerbate to 5 to 15 per cent within a few months. In special circumstances major enzootics occur where the annual incidence of abortion may amount to 20 per cent during several years, whilst, when newly introduced to a susceptible herd, the disease can be severe enough on occasion to produce abortion rates of 20 to 40 per cent of pregnant cattle within a few months. Thus, brucellosis in India, while not dissimilar to the disease in other countries, probably shows greater extremes than elsewhere and attempts are made in this and the following paper to illustrate the way in which environment dominates these contrasts. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Distribution of Brucellosis in India *The data given in this paper were collected during a survey of brucellosis in India conducted under the auspices of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi.
148 Brucellosis in India INCIDENCE AND DISTRIBUTION A conspectus of the incidence of the disease in India appears in the map (Fig. 1), while Table I attempts to summarize its regional distribution in relation to climate. Farms. Most of the organized farms in India have been visited and their stock blood-tested, while specimens from most of the others have been examined. It has been found as a result that, irrespective of situation, nearly all farms are more or less infected. Further, as most of the strains isolated from farms are of the non-indigenous species (Br. abortus), the origin of the infection is attri- buted to cattle imported from the occident. The distribution of farm brucellosis, therefore, is of small significance, being on the whole fortuitous and depending on the situations of farms and the character of their foundation stock. The rate of infection in farms, however, varies and appears to some extent to depend on climate. Thus in military establishments in areas of low rainfall, the normal annual abortion rate is 2 or 3 per cent in cows and about 1 per cent in buffaloes, but the rates in farms situated near the rain belts are sometimes higher (Table II). Again, rates in the indigenous stock of Government farms are about 1 per cent or less in the arid north-west and north and in the upper Gangetic basin, but in the wetter east they rise to 2.5 to 5 per cent or more.

Major epizootics (farms abundant) Negligible Excepting one abnormal rate of 10 per cent in both cows and buffaloes in northern Central Provinces, rates in the few farms of torrid central India are 1 per cent or less. Government farms are rare in the south and west and they seem to be but slightly affected, being mostly well situated climatically. A fair number of quasi commercial private farms lie in and around Calcutta and in the coastal belt of Bombay. The humidity and rainfall here is high and abortion rates in cows and buffaloes alike may reach 20 per cent per annum, while such outbreaks seem to be getting commoner. On the other hand, private farms and gowshalas in the drier hinterland at present appear to be neg- ligibly affected. Village infection. The effect of climate is better illustrated by the distribution of the disease in villages. Obviously, in a country the size of India, it has only been possible to examine a few representative rural areas; nonetheless, discoveries here have been of far greater interest than in arms. If it is to be believed, for instance, that villages have become infected from farms, it would
J. B. POLDING 149 be reasonable to assume that most village infection would lie adjacent thereto. A glance at the map (Fig. 1) shows that such is not the case, and indeed, village infection is commonest where farms are least numerous and vice versâ. Moreover, as shown elsewhere [Polding, in press] all Brucella strains so far isolated from these villages, differ in their typing characteristics from the Br. abortus strains found on farms. It seems, therefore, that village infection, occurring as it does almost ex- clusively on the Indian peninsula, has not been imported from Europe viâ the farms, but is an in- digenous Indian infection whose distribution may prove to be of epidemiological significance. In- deed, inspection of Table I and the map (Fig. 1) reveals a curious position. Infection, as far as it has been discovered, lies mainly in the tri-seasonal rainfall area of the peninsula south-east of the thick line on the map. It has, however, advanced as far as, and follows with considerable accuracy the limits of the bi-seasonal rainfall area south-east of the thin line. Conversely, the minimum village infection seems to be in the arid north-west. It must be admitted, however, that owing to the difficulties of obtaining sufficient truly representative blood samples for testing, the final pre- cise position in north-western villages is not yet fixed, but, so far as tests have been made, the re- actor incidence is negligible. In the south, the position is more exactly known and the incidence of agglutinin-positive village cattle runs between 10 and 50 per cent in villages where abortions occur, but is negligible where abortions are not remarked. In Table III some relevant clinical conditions are correlated with the reactor incidence in village animals of the south. TABLE II Above average abortion rates occurring in the wetter Military Farms 150 Brucellosis in India SUSCEPTIBILITY Inextricably entangled as it is with many little-understood features of disease transmission, susceptibility per se is an imponderable attribute. Further, the only available data on the subject often concern as in this case, statistically unsuitable populations. Hence it becomes necessary to make the best of the available information.

But severe epidemics of abortion can occur, even in non-cohabiting zebu situated in good climates. Tables IX and X give data of one such outbreak. Ninety-five per cent of the aborted animals on this farm were Brucella- positive and if the annual abortion rate during the period of this epidemic be assessed at 25 per cent J. B. POLDING 153 India, where brucellosis is common in village cattle. Thus, of 405 sheep and goats bled in 15 towns of south India, 11 (2.5 per cent) were positive : of 250 tested in 11 towns of north India, none was positive. DISSEMINATION The channels by which Brucella leave and re-enter their host are well known. The point to be noted is that, although these parasites are considered obligatory, in favourable circumstances they will survive outside the host and be available for dissemination. In this part of the paper an at- tempt is made to indicate the conditions governing this dissemination in a continent, where extreme cases give opportunities for comparison not often seen elsewhere. Throughout north-west India, there is daily scorching sunshine from April to October, natural shade is rare, and the total annual rainfall is one inch or less. In the south, conditions are the converse, temperatures vary little around blood heat, the atmosphere and land surface are moist, while natural shade is everywhere more com- mon and for fairly long periods the sky is overcast. However, this survey has shown that brucellosis is enzootic in the south and rare in the north-west. The inference is that sunshine and dryness are inimical to Brucella, or conversely that equable temperatures, humidity and shade favour their sur- vival. Certain less general observations support this premise. Earlier in this paper, the decrease of brucellosis on the Punjab grantee farms was noted. These farms lie in a semi-desert tract and for the most part their indigenous stock live and calve out-of-doors. It is possible that this is an example of self-elimination of brucellosis due to animals living in dry, sun-lit surroundings. By contrast, there are three farms in Assam, a region enduring a heavy and protracted monsoon and lying within the bi-seasonal rainbelt. The animals of these farms are similar in type and origin to those of the grantee herds, yet in 1941 the incidence of reactors amongst them was 20 per cent, whilst their abortion rate varied from 2 to 6 per cent per annum. In another indigenous herd of the Punjab (farm I), the mean annual abortion rate during the climatically normal period 1930-1935 was 1.27 per cent of several thousand pregnancies, while during the entirely rainless period 1936-1939 the rate was only 0.66 per cent. Here, another important consideration arises, for during the rainless years the stock could not be grazed but had to be stall- fed in congested corrals. The result of this over-crowding was a severe epidemic of tuberculosis. It appears, therefore, that conditions of congestion, sufficient to produce an air-borne respiratory infection due to a relatively resistant organism, resulted in a decrease of Brucella infection during a period of constant sunshine and extreme dryness. Thus congestion as a factor in the spread of bru- cellosis may be secondary to excess of sunlight. In contradistinction to these observations in the classical outbreak noted in Tables IX and X (farm 2). Here again atmospheric humidity was negligible and sunlight was more or less conti- nuous. Congestion also was extreme, the animals never being out of the farm compound. The contradictory results of farms 1 and 2 may perhaps be explained on the grounds of hygienic condi- tions. On farm 1, aborting animals were segregated and gross infective materials, such as the pla- centa, were quickly destroyed. On farm 2, no such precautions were taken and general cleanliness was lacking. In cows, therefore, it appears that, provided gross sources of contagion are removed, the steri- lizing effects of sunlight are sufficient to suppress the remaining minor sources, even when conges- tion is great; conversely, where animals are dispersed, hygiene becomes of less importance and the effects of sunlight are paramount. Village cattle on the whole graze over wide areas and dispersion thus counteracts the lack of hygiene, but here again sunlight probably plays a major part in sup- pressing the disease. There are, however, other aspects of the effect of climate on the dissemination of Brucella, namely humidity and rainfall, but while the possible importance of moisture is well illustrated by the restriction of indigenous brucellosis to the humid tracts of India, it is even more sharply em- phasised by some aspects of the epidemiology of brucellosis in buffaloes.
154 Brucellosis in India Only one major endemic of brucellosis has been encountered in buffaloes (farm 3). Here the annual abortion rate was 21 per cent of pregnancies over a period of six years ; this for India is cer- tainly excessive, possibly unique. In an attempt to explain this unusual incidence, many environ- mental factors have been considered but the only extraordinary influence discoverable was the ex- ceptionally heavy monsoon, with 80 in. of rainfall during the period June to September. Table XI presents a statement of the monthly abortion rates among susceptible stock, calculated from an ag- gregate of the returns for five years. This shows that abortion-rate for the months November to July varied little about a mean of 1.4 and although the population of susceptible animals steadily increases from January to July, there is no corresponding increase in the abortion-rate. In August, however, whilst the number of susceptible animals commences to decrease, the abortion-rate sud- denly doubles and in September and October it is thrice the mean for the normal months of the year. Thereafter, the rate returns to normal. Now as the period of transmission and incubation of the disease is likely to occupy a period of 1 to 2 months, the critical period of increased infection-rate causing the increased abortion-rate during August, September and October, commences in mid- June and lasts into August. But in this period the abortion-rate, and therefore presumably the bacterial excretion-rate, is constant, whilst the corrected number of susceptible animals does not vary greatly round a mean of 1200 ; further the absolute number of abortions in July is the same as in May. In other words donor and receptor influences do not vary sufficiently during this period to account for the large increase of abortions in August, September and October, and this increase must be explained by a change in environment which affects bacterial survival and transmission. But in mid-June the climate changes completely from diurnal sunlight to total sunlessness and con- tinuous rainfall and this suggests that either the absence of sunlight or the presence of moisture, or both, favours the spread of brucellosis in buffaloes.

As before however the factor of congestion complicates the picture. During the buffaloes cannot be grazed and consequently they stand in congested cowsheds, sometimes for weeks on end. The influence of congestion may perhaps be eliminated by comparing this result with the records of farm 2 above, which, besides carrying the herd of Brucella-infected cattle already dis- cussed, keeps a herd of closely cohabiting buffaloes. It is remarkable that during the epidemic no abortions occurred in buffaloes, despite their exposure to excessive infection from cows. Now on each farm the factor of congestion is probably about equal, but on farm 2, as evidenced by the spread in cows, the abundant sunlight was unable to destroy the infection, and the two environments may be compared as in Table XII.

This and many other similar records lead to the same conclusion and it is tempting to accept the simple explanation that at least among buffaloes a fluid vehicle is more satisfactory for dissemina- tion than a dry one. In this respect the buffalo's habit of wallowing requires consideration. Observa- tions on this habit have been recorded by Minett [1947]. In north India at least buffaloes wallow voluntarily from April to October and there is a natural desire to do so when the air and water tem- peratures are above 85° and 77°F. respectively. The desire to wallow is intense during hot damp months, August and September in north India. During the hot dry period of April to June, water is short and the few available shrunken tanks and ponds are grossly congested, while during the rains, the animals are dispersed over a far wider expense of water. If therefore it can be accepted that the sterilizing effect of sunlight, which is admittedly great for Brucella, can suppress the contagion during the sunny months, then increased infection of buffaloes during the rains, despite wider dispersion, might be partially accounted for by wallowing, especially when this is done in tanks. Many epidemiologists have associated moisture with the spread of diseases. Rogers [1926], for example, found that cholera spreads as the absolute humidity reaches 0.4 in. and it may be noted in passing that, in lower Bengal and on the Coramandal and Malabar coasts (i.e., in the Brucella- endemic areas of India) the absolute humidity is never below 0.4 in. About Brucella little has been proffered, but Cameron [1932], who has tested fairly thoroughly the viability of Brucella, shows on the whole that drying is harmful to the organism. SUMMARY The results of a survey of brucellosis in India have been analysed in an effort to trace some of the factors which control the spread of the disease in that country. The scatter of the disease amongst farms was uniform and thus uninformative. On the other hand, an indigenous enzootic among village cattle occurred throughout the bi- and tri-seasonal rain- fall areas only. The incidence of infection in farms was often high where total rainfall was high, and vice versâ. The rate of village infection was negligible in semi-desert areas but considerable in humid coastal belts. It is concluded that the sterilizing effect of continuous sunlight is paramount in checking dissemina- tion of the disease, while humidity, rainfall and sunlessness are favourable to its spread. Neverthe- less, unhygienic conditions and congestion of animals play an important part in transmission. Abortion statistics are given for European zebu crossbreds, for pure zebus, and for buffaloes. The susceptibility of these animals and of sheep and goats is assessed. REFERENCES Cameron, H.S. (1932). Cornell Veterinarian. 14, 16 Minett, F.C. (1947). J. Animal Sci. 6, 35 Rogers, L. (1926).

INDIAN SPECIES OF BRUCELLA By J. B. POLDING, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaon (Received for publication on 8 May 1947) NOT all Brucella can be exactly classified and in an examination of some 2,000 strains Huddleson [1939] refers to 13 that were not precisely abortus, melitensis or suis. Huddleson has recently intimated to me that a correspondent of his has encountered a certain atypical variant in Indonesia, which appears to be indigenous to that country. The characteristics therefore of strains isolated in India will be of interest and in this paper are described some 49 strains collected at random from this country. EXPERIMENTAL Methods The criteria used for typing were, (1) CO2 requirements at time of isolation, (2) H2S secretion, (3) inhibitory action of dye media, and (4) antigenic structure. The techniques of items (1) to (3) were those of Huddleson [1939], that of (4) was based on the work of Wilson and Miles [1932]. Controls with type-specific strains were prepared throughout. Strains were examined for dissociation as follows. Two-day-old agar cultures were suspended in 12 per cent. saline and adjusted to density 1 to 2 on Brown's scale. The suspensions were immersed in boiling water and readings for agglutination made after 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. The suspensions were then removed and left on the bench until the following morning when they were again examined for agglutination. A strain agglutinating in these circumstances was regarded as dissociated. Tests for antigenic sensitivity were made as follows. Standard antigens were prepared by suspending 48-hour-old slant cultures in 12 per cent. saline and their density very accurately adjusted to 1 on Brown's scale. Stableforth's [1936] standard dried serum was reconstructed according to his directions, but the concentration of his final dilution series was halved in saline. In a series of tubes, 0.5 c.c. of the antigen to be examined was added to 0.5 c.c. of each dilution of serum in the halved Stableforth series, thus forming a titration range of 1/640, 1/800, 1/960 and 1/1120 and 1/1280 and the ultimate reaction after 24 hours' incubation at 37°C. was noted. In this range, type-specific antigen prepared in a similar way had been previously found to react to about + + at 1/1280, and this titre was accepted as the datum with which the end points of the titrations of the field strain were compared. Strain typing In the intemperate climate of India, the procuring of satisfactory specimens for bacteriological examination offers many peculiar difficulties. The main troubles are the early putrefaction of dead tissues, dust contamination, long periods of transportation in warm environment and above all difficulties of communication, for abortions usually occur without notice in remote localities, which cannot be reached in time by persons qualified and equipped to take samples fit for examination. The Brucella strains it has been possible to secure have thus been disappointingly few, but such as they are their origin and classification are given in Table I. In this classification, all 26 Br. abortus strains fell precisely into class, with no discrepancies. It is also noteworthy that all came from organized farms, most of which have carried or are still carrying European cross-bred stock, and that they occurred equally in cows and buffaloes. As regards the melitensis strains, in all three there was little doubt as to their classification (Table II). It will be observed that first two strains were rough, so that their antigenic structure could not be examined, but in all probability they are normal melitensis types. They are alleged to have been isolated some years ago from a cow and a goat in the Punjab. The third strain was isolated recently 157

The reason for the appearance of these strains is obscure, but it is possible that the third at least was brought from overseas. The twenty strains termed 'unclassified' all differed from true Br. abortus types in one main characteristic, i.e. they grew both on thionin and fuchsin. Also the majority, although undeniably abortus antigenically, showed a slight tendency not to differentiate so sharply as pure abortus types on serological tests against monospecific sera, whilst two were distinctly melitensis in this respect. One strain isolated from Patna and one from Mukteswar, whilst conforming to the above grouping, also grew in air at isolation. Table III illustrates the typing results of some of these unclassified strains ; those not shown in the Table were unexceptional in their behaviour and are typified by the Madras or Orissa village strains of the Table. Such strains will be referred to as " abortus/melitensis", or A/M for short.

Moreover, field strains were always typed in lots of 10 or 12 at the same time, and it is significant that out of the 49 strains no less than 20 inescapably gave this ambiguous result. It is concluded therefore that this abortus/melitensis type is a common indian Brucella variant, its constant characteristic being ability to grow on both thionin and fuchsin. Variably, it will grow in air on first isolation (two cases out of 20); its antigenic constitution is unstable, two strains out of 20 being melitensis antigenically and the rest conforming more or less to the structure of abortus. Agglutination absorption tests have been made on these abortus/melitensis strains to observe whether they contain any additional, hitherto undescribed antigen, but this does not appear to be the case. As to the origin of these aberrant types, it is significant that all the six strains isolated from villages of the Indian peninsula were of this nature. It is suggested, therefore, that this is a South Indian indigenous variant and that the true Br. abortus type, as yet exclusively found on organized farms, is an imported European strain. Further, a consideration of the part played by climate in the dissemination of Brucella (Polding, in press) suggests that, if there was a spread of infection from the villages of this peninsula it would be likely to occur along the relatively humid Himalayan foot-hills and perhaps descend into the Gangetic plain. It is of interest, therefore, that the abortus/melitensis strains, so far isolated from organized farms, have been found at JubbulporeJ. B.

A=Br. abortus M=Br. melitensis A/M=Br. abortus/melitensis CO2=CO2 sensitive The Indian strains tested were recently isolated and, except the melitensis strain, were CO2 sensitive. As might be expected, the order of virulence proved to be : melitensis most virulent abortus-melitensis of intermediate virulence, and abortus least virulent. As repeated sub-culturing is supposed to lead to loss of virulence, a comparison with the overseas type-specific strains must be made with caution. It is to be remembered that the Maltese strain was isolated six years pre- viously and the English abortus strain must be many years old. After making due allowance for this, however, the experiment suggests little difference between Indian and overseas species. To check up this suggestion, in Table VI a comparison is shown between the Indian strains and an average result of four recently isolated English Br. abortus strains typed by Priestley and McEwen [1938]. If it can be believed that tests done by different persons are comparable, the foregoing conception of virulence seems to be substantiated. DISCUSSION The apparent rarity of melitensis strains in India is note-worthy, for while corroborating the belief of most contemporary observers, it accords ill with the early history of human infection, which for this reason merits a brief scrutiny. From the year of Wright and Smith's [1897] demonstration
162 Indian Species of Brucella of the agglutination test for brucellosis until the far-reaching revelations of the Mediterranean Fever Commission [1905-07] an ever-growing number of reports were published of undulant fever in India.

POLDING 163 Nevertheless, it is of deep interest why a disease, so prevalent in man on the goat-populated Mediterranean littoral, should be apparently so rare in man in India, where in certain parts at least sheep and goats are abundant. At one time the simple explanation of the almost universal Indian custom of the boiling of milk was stressed as the explanation, but in France Taylor, Lisbonne, Vidal and Hazemann [1938] have clearly shown that at least among breeders of goats and sheep, and possibly also amongst all who come in close contact with these animalsEXPERIMENTS ON THE TRANSMISSION OF SURRA BY THE TICK ORNITHODOROS THOLOZANI LABOULBENE AND MEGNIN By S. K. SEN, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar (Received for publication on 15 October 1946) IN a paper published in 1922,* Cross and Patel, in the Punjab, brought forward some evidence to show that, under experimental conditions, surra was capable of being transmitted through the agency of Ornithodoros tholozani Laboulbene and Megnin166 Experiments on the transmission of Surra Group VII. 2 September About 135 ticks fed as above, but kept in incubator at 25ºC. The object of keeping a proportion of the ticks in the incubator was to determine the effect, if any, of a relatively high temperature on the viability of the trypanosomes after being ingested by these ticks, this possibility, as already mentioned, having been suggested by Yorke and Macfic. The infectivity of ticks taken from each of these seven groups was later tested at various intervals on healthy rabbits, a note being taken of the actual number of ticks fed on each occasion in order that, in the event of the result being positive, some indication might be obtained as to the minimum number of ticks necessary to produce infection. The experimental rabbits were observed for about three weeks and the results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. TABLE I.

SEETHARAMAN, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar-Kumaon (Received for publication on 6 May 1947) ALTHOUGH an efficient prophylactic vaccine has now been evolved for use in the field, much can be done apart from this to control the disease in unvaccinated areas by means that can easily be employed by poultry farmers. The experiments described in this paper were designed to examine some aspects of this control. Various views and experimental data on the dissemination of Ranikhet disease under natural or artificial conditions are recorded in the literature on the subject. Outbreaks of the disease occur mostly on the introduction into healthy flocks of newly purchased birds which are either diseased or are in the incubation period or have just recovered, and the dissemination of virus is brought about by infected exudates and excreta. Outbreaks in flocks with no history of contact infection are attributed to the dissemination of the virus by such mechanical carriers as crows, pigeons, vultures and other wild birds, but there is as yet no proof of this nor has the virus been isolated from any such carriers. The possibility of its transmission by fowl ticks (Argas persicus) has been investigated by Komarov [1940] with negative results. We have observed that lice from an infected bird on being transferred to a healthy one did not transmit the. disease. Thus the digestive and respiratory tracts appear to be the usual routes of infection. Extensive studies have been made on the bionomics of the causal agent in countries where the disease occurs. Virus suspension, on which most of the experimental work has been done, at ice temperature retains its viability for several months and this explains the wide incidence of the disease during the cold season. However, the virus is very fragile and is readily affected by a warm at- mospheric temperature and by sunlight. At 50ºC. to 55ºC. the virus is rendered inert by 30 minutes' exposure and killed by direct sunlight in one hour. In garden soil or in stagnant water at room temperature (temperature not given) it became non-infective in four days [Farinas, 1930]. In con- taminated brooders Dobson [1939] was able to recover the virus for a period of seven weeks. In the light of these data a vigilant breeder can achieve considerable success in mitigating losses. The secretions, excretions and tissues of affected fowls are all infective, providing wide scope for dissemi- nation. Doyle [1927] demonstrated that the disease is readily produced by a light application over the mouth and pharynx with a swab of cotton wool soaked with mouth exudate of an affected bird. Even small quantities of the virus set up the disease by intravenous, subcutaneous and intraperi- toneal inoculations, as well as by scarification and instillation into the eye or into the respiratory tract [Stover, 1942] of susceptible birds. Under natural conditions, apart from direct contact168 Transmission of Ranikhet disease of fowls Virus in water. One hundred cubic centimetres water into which 2.0 gm. fresh infected spleen had been stirred was put into the drinking pots of each of the seven birds. Each bird took appro- ximately 17 c.c. of the suspension within half an hour and was then segregated Another fowl was given 0.5 gm. of tissue suspended in 5 c.c. water, the mixture being pipetted on to the back of the throat. All the eight birds contracted the disease and died within 4-7 days after the infective drink. EXPERIMENTS ON INHALATION Two wooden boxes were so constructed that through an opening on one side the neck of the fowl would protrude, the base of the neck being held in position by means of a cardboard collar. The two boxes were so placed that there was a distance of two feet between the beaks of the two birds, one infected 48 hours previously with Ranikhet disease virus and the other healthy. The entire structure was covered with a piece of muslin cloth for ventilation. After three hours' exposure the healthy bird was removed; four days later, it developed symptoms of the disease and died on the fifth day. The day after removal of the first healthy bird, another healthy one was exposed under identical conditions to the infected bird now in its third day from inoculation. In this case also the disease was conveyed through the expired air to the healthy bird which died on the seventh day. Another healthy bird was similarly exposed to a fowl infected four days previously showing signs of acute illness. In this case infection was not transmitted and the bird was later found sus- ceptible. In three subsequent trials the distance was increased to three feet, the time of exposure and other conditions remaining unchanged. In all these, however, the results were negative. In a second series of experiments carried out under similar conditions except that the muslin was replaced by thick cloth of close texture so as to minimise air currents, a healthy bird was ex- posed for three hours to an infected fowl at a distance of two feet. Fifteen days later the exposed bird proved susceptible to Ranikhet virus. This experiment was repeated thrice with similar results. In another experiment a healthy bird was exposed under the same conditions but for a duration of six hours with negative result. In a third experiment of this second series involving three infected and three healthy fowls the distance was reduced to one foot. However, in only one case did the healthy bird contract the disease, dying on the 7th day. DISCUSSION It appears that Ranikhet disease virus is rendered inert in the digestive tract. The above results may be explained by the fact that, whereas solid food is quickly swallowed, during the process of drinking fowls fill the mouth, raise the head and swallow each gulp gradually so that the mouth, pharynx and larynx become contaminated. It seems likely therefore that infection takes place via. the nasopharynx and before the virus enters the crop, since swabbing the throat with the virus easily produces infection. There is little doubt however, that under natural conditions droplet infection is the most common method of transmission. The experience of Farinas [1930] that infec- tion is not readily transmitted between cages may be explained by the lack of air currents favourable for spread. In droplet infection the chances of transmission by coughing or breathing largely depend on the distance between the infected and susceptible. If the distance is too great, the virus may be diluted beyond its infective potentiality. After expulsion the virus may be carried by air currents some distance from its source and contaminate the surrounding areas. This explains how, as some- times noted in practice, an outbreak of Ranikhet disease starting at one end of a poultry farm may spread in a few days to the interior and even to the farthest corner of the farm. SUMMARY 1. Ranikhet disease virus, enclosed in a gelatin capsule, within wheat dough or mixed with grains, when introduced directly into the digestive tract does not produce the disease in susceptible birds. 2. Susceptible birds contract the disease when allowed to drink water containing Ranikhet disease virus in the form of tissue suspension from infected birds.

POSSIBILITY OF COLOURING VANASPATI WITH RATANJOT TO PREVENT ITS USE AS AN ADULTERANT IN GHEE By NOSHIR N. DASTUR, A. KANNAN AND ZAL R. KOTHAVALLA, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 20 November 1946) HYDROGENATED vegetable oils, or what are popularly known as vanaspati, are used now a days in large quantities as cooking media. They provide a cheap substitute for ghee for this purpose and for this reason are normally made to resemble ghee, as closely as possible, in appearance. The two being visually very similar there is always the temptation to vendors to mix the cheaper product (vanaspati) with ghee and to pass the mixture off as genuine ghee. The detection of the admixture of these two is further made difficult by the fact that there is great variation in the chemi- cal composition of ghee and it is not always possible to distinguish between genuine ghee and adultera- ed products, even by routine chemical methods. The ordinary purchaser must rely on his sight to distinguish between the two products and in order to enable him to do this it has been strongly urged that all vanaspati manufactured in India should be given such a distinct colour that it may not be mistaken for ghee even by a casual pur- chaser. Deep yellow (turmeric) and orange colour (like the one given by annatto) are obviously not suitable. Next to these two, red is the most agreeable colour. It was therefore, decided to carry out trials to determine the most suitable variation in red to colour vanaspati and 'rose red' or the tint commonly known as 'Gulabi' was finally decided upon. The selection of this tint no doubt was rather arbitrary, considering the fact that the accepted colour of natural fats is yellow but that made the selection of a tint other than yellow all the more necessary, as long as it was not repulsive to the consumer and fulfilled all the requirements of a cooking medium; for, after all vanas- pati is used for this purpose only. The dye to be used for colouring edible products like vanaspati must fulfil certain essential re- quirements such as, (a) it must be easily available, (b) it should be non-toxic in raw state or even after heating to the frying temperature of vanaspati, (c) it should not in any way affect the quality of vanaspati by lowering its keeping quality or imparting a foreign flavour to it and (d) the coloured vanaspati must be stable to light and heat to a reasonable extent so that the colour may not be des- troyed during storage. Preliminary examination of several natural and synthetic dyes showed that the red dye obtained from the ratanjot roots, Onosma echides, fulfilled all the above conditions. Ratan- jot plants grow in abundance in colder regions of India. The roots form the main source of the dye. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of the Dye. The colouring principles of ratanjot are insoluble in water but freely soluble in fats and common organic solvents. The dye was usually concentrated by extraction with ether. Before extracting the roots with ether, they were steeped in ten parts of water for about 24 hours. The roots were dried at room temperature and fibres and other impurities were removed. The loss in weight during the steeping was of the order of 6 per cent. The percentage of impurities, including fibres, etc., varied from 13 to 18 per cent. Thus on the whole the quantity of extractable roots was about 80 per cent of the original roots taken. Steeping was also done in 5 per cent salt solution. This however, did not give any better results. The concentration obtained was to the extent of 6 per cent calculated on the basis of the weight of cleaned roots. The constitution of the colouring principles of the ratanjot roots has not been studied in detail but presumably it is closely related to that of the alkanet roots, Anchusa tinctoria, lam. [Perkin and Everest, 1918.] Nargund [1942] suggested the formula C30 H28 O8 for the colouring matter. It melts at 220ºC., with previous softening at about 190ºC. Ratanjot roots are commonly sold in the bazar. The roots on storing do not seem to loose their colour imparting property. The colour concentrate, extracted with ether, when stored at 37ºC., 171 F
172 Colouring Vanaspati with Ratanjot for eight months did not suffer deterioration in the colour giving property and can thus be taken as fairly stable under ordinary storage conditions. On the other hand, if the dye is heated to a very high temperature it does not give any red colour to fats but will still give the characteristic blue colour with alkali which is now taken as a specific test for indicating the presence of ratanjot. Colouring vanaspati. The concentrate obtained by extraction with other is not directly used for colouring vanaspati as it is found that all of it is not soluble in fats. One hundred grams of vanas- pati require nearly 0.25 gm. of this concentrate to give an almost saturated solution of colour in fat. To extract all the colour, the mixture is repeatedly heated to about 60ºC. with constant stirring. This is then filtered and the deep red vanaspati used for colouring any further quantities of vanaspati to the required intensity is obtained. On an average vanaspati of the kind ordinarily offered in the market requires 5.5 gm. of the concentrated coloured vanaspati of the type, described above, to colour 1000 gm. of it to one red unit, as measured in Lovibond Tintometer using 1 cm. cell, the colour com- parison being carried out at 50ºC. This gives a concentration of 0.0096 per cent. Under practical trade conditions a colour intensity of seven red units is suggested as most suitable. A high intensity of colour can easily be given, but for the purpose in view this is not necessary, as the presence of vanaspati so coloured can fairly easily be detected as has been described later. Stability of coloured vanaspati to light. Investigations were carried out with different brands of vanaspaties available in the market, and they were coloured to three different intensities, viz. five, six and seven red units. For the sake of brevity, however, results obtained with only one popular brand of vanaspati, made from the groundnut oil, and coloured to seven red units, have been dealt with below. The vanaspati in question was kept in glass bottles stoppered with corks and exposed to ordinary daylight in the laboratory. The changes in colour, peroxide values and acidity were recorded at intervals. Peroxide values were determined by the method described by Dastur and Lea [1940] and expressed as ml. of N/500 thiosulphate per gm. of fat. Acidity was estimated by the method described in the Handbook of the A.O.A.C. [1945] and expressed as percentage of oleic acid. The results are given in Table I.

N. N. DASTUR, A. KANNAN AND Z. R. KOTHAVALLA 173 The main conclusions which can be drawn from the data given in Table I are as follows: (a) The colour of ratanjot is somewhat sensitive to light. It is, therefore, necessary to see that coloured vanaspati is not exposed to light as far as possible. This will not be a difficult matter under-trade conditions as the vanaspati is invariably sold packed in tins. (b) The presence of ratanjot does not in any way affect the keeping quality of vanaspati. The acidity does not show an increase even after an interval of 157 days. (c) The peroxide values indicate that ratanjot seems to have anti-oxident properties. Stability of coloured vanaspati to heat. Vanaspati samples were kept in glass bottles and stored at: (a) Room temperature in dark. (b) At 37ºC. in an incubator. (c) At 42ºC. in an incubator. The results obtained are shown in Table II.

Considering the extent of the decrease noted, this may not be considered serious under practical trade conditions, as vanaspati may ordinarily be expected to be disposed off in 3.4 months' time after its manufacture. (b) Under ordinary climatic conditions, a decrease of about 10 per cent in the colour intensity may be expected in about six months' time. This was further borne out by the fact that coloured vanaspati samples kept in sealed tins under climatic conditions prevail- ing in Bangalore and Bombay during summer months showed a decrease in colour to the extent of 11 per cent after six months' storage in Bombay and 1 per cent after three months' storage in Bangalore. (c) During these studies a record of the development of peroxide value and acidity was also kept. No difference in the keeping quality of the coloured vanaspati and original samples was observed. Effect of adsorbents on coloured vanaspati The edible colours as a rule are removable to varying degrees by the use of different kinds of adsorbents. This fact is in practice is utilized for bleaching vegetable oils used in the manufacture of vanaspati itself. It is, therefore, to be expected that these adsorbents would also remove the colour from coloured vanaspati. To study the effects of the various adsorbents quantitatively, therefore the following experiments were carried out: (a) One hundred grams of coloured vanaspati were mixed with known amounts of rice husk, charcoal, Fuller's earth and kaolin. The mixtures were heated off and on for three hours at 70ºC. with occasional stirring. The fat was then filtered and the colour com- pared. The results obtained are given in Table III.

Activated charcoal seems the cheapest and best adsorbent. Based on this property, a method has been suggested later for detecting the presence of ratanjot even in a very small quantity. This removal of colour from coloured vanaspati by adsorbents, it may be argued, is likely to provide a loop-hole to the trade, viz., to first refine the vanaspati before mixing it with ghee. It is however, felt that the separation of adsorbents from the fat may not prove such an easy matter for small merchants. The treatment cannot be adopted on such an extensive scale as theoretial results would suggest and yet go undetected. Based on the fact that the colour of vanaspati can be removed by adsorbents, some workers have suggested that addition of sesame oil to vanaspati would provide a more effective way of detect- ing the presence of vanaspati if used as an adulterant with ghee, viz., the application of a specific test 'Furfurol test,' for sesame oil. Experiments were, therefore, carried out using coloured vanaspati containing 5 and 10 per cent sesame oil. These samples were treated with 5 per cent char- coal and Fuller's earth. The decrease in the colour intensity of the Furfurol reaction and the colour of vanaspati was observed as noted in Table IV. TABLE IV Percentage of decrease in the intensity of colour when treated with adsorbents Amount of sesame oil in coloured vanaspati (7 red units) Charcoal Fuller's Earth Furfurol test Colour of vanaspati Furfurol test Colour of vanaspati 5 per cent . . . . . 24.4 69.4 66.7 58.3 10 per cent . . . . . 55.5 86.1 88.9 69.4 It will be seen that as far as the effect of adsorbents is concerned, both coloured vanaspati and vanaspati containing sesame oil, are almost equally affected. This point is very important but is overlooked by those who advocate the addition of sesame oil in preference to colouring vanaspati for detecting its presence in ghee as an adulterant. Use of coloured vanaspati to detect adulteration in ghee. (i) Visual Detection. The main object of colouring vandapati is that if any of it is added to ghee its presence should be evident to the consumer. A colour intensity of seven red units is suggested as it is expected to provide a reasonably good safeguard without making vanaspati in any way un- welcome to the consumer. Adopting this colour standard, it has been possible to detect visually the
N. N. DASTUR, A. K-ANNAN AND Z. R. KOTHAWALLA 175 presence of even 5 per cent of coloured vanaspati in buffalo ghee and of 15 per cent in cow ghee. This is a great improvement over the existing routine chemical tests with which it is not possible to detect even up to 20176 Colouring Vanaspati with Ratanjot when most of the charcoal goes to the bottom. The fat layer is then decanted off. The residual charcoal is warmed with 5 ml. of chloroform and filtered. The filtrate is collected in a white porcelain dish. The extraction is repeated two more time. The total filtrate is now freed from solvents on a water bath and a strong aqueous solution of alkali is added. The residue in the dish assumes a greenish blue tint in the presence of ratanjot. Ghee prepared from cow's milk or from artificially coloured butter does not show any change on the addition of alkali when subjected to similar treatment. By this test it is possible to detect the presence of even 5 per cent of added coloured vanaspati. Toxicity of ratanjot gye. This has been systematically tested in experiments with rats and guinea pigs. It is found to be completely harmless. Even on heating to the frying temperature it does not acquire any toxic effects. SUMMARY To safeguard trade in genuine ghee it is considered desirable that all vanaspati should be coloured. The colour should be attractive, very distinct from that of natural ghee, non-toxic, fairly stable to heat and light and should not impart any foreign taste and odour to vanaspati. The use of ratanjot for this purpose is suggested. The intensity of colour recommended is seven red units. As vanaspati is solely used as cooking medium its colouring is not likely to harm the legitimate interests of the vanaspati trade in any way. Food cooked in vanaspati so coloured does not acquire any extraneous flavour, taste or colour. Vanaspati coloured with ratanjot is found to preserve its colour at atmospheric temperature and in diffuse light such as are likely to be encountered under conditions during its storage and marketing. Coloured vanaspati does not suffer in any way in its keeping quality. While there are other tests such as the addition of sesame oil to vanaspati which can help to detect adulteration, colouring vanaspati provides the most direct and the simplest solution.

COMPONENT OF FATTY ACIDS OF BUTTERFATS, HYDROGENATED GROUNDNUT OILS AND MUSTARD OIL By V. R. BHALERAO, D. VENKATAPPIAH, AND C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 4 November 1946) NUMEROUS investigations have been reported on the detailed analysis of the cow butterfat, but not much information is available about the component acids of butterfats of Indian cow, buffalo, goat and sheep. Bhattacharya and Hilditch [1931] have studied the component acids of buffalo butterfat, but they have not taken into consideration the presence of lower unsaturated acids reported to be present in milk fats by Bowsworth and Brown [1933] and subsequently confirmed by Hilditch and Paul [1936], Longenecker [1937], Hilditch and Longenecker [1938] and others. Dhingra [1933] in his studies on the milk fats of Indian goat and sheep, has also omitted to estimate the lower unsaturated acids. Apart from these, no data has been published of the detailed composition of the component fatty acids of the butterfat. During some recent studies on the nutritive value of various fats carried out at this Institute a large number of fats were collected. This opportunity was taken to make a detailed study of the composition of buffalo, cow, goat and sheep ghee. Hydrogenated groundnut oils of m.p. 34.1ºC., 37.0ºC., and 39.0ºC., and a sample of mustard oil were also available and they have been analysed in detail. EXPERIMENTAL Samples of genuine cow ghee from different breeds namely Kangayam, Sindhi, Ongole, Gir, Sahiwal, Hariana, Kangraj and Tharparkar were collected from different ghee-producing centres in India178 Components of Fatty Acids of Butter Fats TABLE I Analytical Constants of Fats used for detailed Analysis Sample Melting point B.

182 Components of Fatty Acids of Butter Fats DISCUSSION From the analytical data in Table I it will be seen that goat and sheep butterfats have almost similar characteristics to those of cow and buffalo butterfats. Goat and sheep butterfats have a high Polenske value and low iodine value. In the case of groundnut vanaspatis with a higher degree of hydrogenation as indicated by the melting point, there is a gradual decrease in the B. R. index and iodine value. The mustard oil is characterised from the other fats by a very high iodine value, and low saponification value, indicating the presence of glycerides of high molecular weight fatty acids. The amount of butyric acid in cow butterfat as seen in Tables II and V is higher than in other butterfats in which the molar percentage of this acid is almost equal. The values for C6 C10 acids in goat and sheep ghee confirm the high Polenske value already described in Table I. The data given by Dhingra [1937] and Hilditch and Jasperson [1944] are in agreement with present results. The percentage of lauric acid is also higher in the butterfats of goat and sheep. With regard to percentage of stearic acid, it is seen that the proportions in buffalo, goat and sheep butterfats are almost similar, while cow butterfat is richer by about 6.0 per cent in stearic acid content. The sum of myristo-palmi- to-stearic group acids is, however, constant in all the butterfats. The total of all the acids up to C14 is higher in case of goat (31.5 per cent, and sheep 32.9 per cent) milkfats as compared to cow (20.3 per cent) and buffalo (21.2 per cent) milkfats. This is mainly caused by the high amount of capric and lauric acids in goat and sheep butterfats. Arachidic acid is almost similar in all the fats. The percentage of the lower unsaturated acids C10-C16 in the butterfats is confirmed in the present study [cf. also Acharya and Banerjee, 1946]. It is found that they are distributed in almost the same proportion in all the butterfats. The percentage of oleic acid is similar in cow and buffalo butterfats, while in goat and sheep butterfats, the proportion is found to be much less as will be seen from Table V. This is in close agreement with the iodine values of the samples. There are marked variations in linoleic acid content of different butterfats. However, Hilditch has shown that the amount of this acid in butterfat varies with the diet of the animals as it increases if the animals are given plenty of green grass. It is found from the data that unsaturated acids higher than C18 are also present. No attempt was made to examine this fraction in detail and they have been grouped as C20-C22 unsaturated acids. The proportions of this fraction in different butterfats were found to be almost similar. Our results for palmitic and stearic acids in buffalo ghee agree closely with those of Acharya and Banerjee [1946]. The amount of oleic acid in the sample analysed here is much higher (26.3 per cent molar) than the value (17 per cent molar) shown by the above workers. These workers, however, have not given detailed results and as such no strict comparison can be made. Our results for the major component acids of goat and sheep butterfats agree with those of Dhingra [1933]. It is also found (Table V) that the proportions of different acids in sheep butterfats are almost similar to those of goat butterfat. The results of the analysis of hydrogenated groundnut oils of m.p. 34.1ºC., 37.0oC. and 39.0ºC. are represented in Table III. It is seen from those results that as the melting point increases from 34.1ºC. to 39.0ºC., there is a gradual increase in the content of stearic acid from 6.2 to 12.6 per cent. Hydrogenation, however, does not seem to affect palmitic acid, arachidic, behenic, and lignoceric acid contents. Obviously the total amount of saturated acids progressively increases with the rise in melting point. The percentages of oleic and linoleic acids on the other hand, gradually decrease. The net result of hydrogenation is the conversion of C18 unsaturated acids to C18 saturated acids. The results of the composition of Indian mustard oil are presented in Table IV. The results closely agree with those reported by Sudborough et al [1926]. Mustard oil differs from common edible oils in that it contains a very high proportion of eureic acid (51.0 per cent). The oleic and linoleic acids are present to the extent of 29.8 per cent and 18.2 per cent respectively. Thus the total un- saturated acids in the mustard oil are 96.4 per cent, the remaining being made up of small quantities of myristic, behenic and lignoceric acids.
V. R. BHALERAO, et al 183 SUMMARY (1) Detailed analysis of fatty acids of cow, buffalo, goat and sheep butterfats, hydrogenated groundnut oils of melting point 34.1ºC., 37.0ºC., and 39.0ºC. and mustard oil have been carried out. (2) The cow and buffalo butterfats are found to be similar in composition and differ from goat and sheep butterfats, in that the latter contain more of caprylic, capric, and lauric acids and less of oelic acid. The presence of unsaturated acids lower than C18 in the butterfats of buffalo, goat and sheep have also been confirmed. (3) In case of hydrogenated samples of groundnut oil, with the increase in the melting point there was a gradual lowering in the content of oleic and linoleic acids and a corresponding increase in stearic acid. (4) The chief component fatty acids of mustard oil are found to be eureic acid (51.0 per cent), oleic acid (29.8 per cent) and linoleic acid (18.2 per cent).

VITAMIN C CONTENT OF THE MILK OF SOME IMPORTANT BREEDS OF INDIAN CATTLE By KERALA VARMA AND T. M. PAUL, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 27 September 1946) A CONSIDERABLE of work has been done abroad to study the vitamin C content of milk and the influence of various factors like feed, season of the year, etc., on it. Riddel et al [1935] observed that the vitamin C content of milk was not subject to changes in the diet of the cow. Whitnah and Riddel [1937] studied the various factors affecting the vitamin C content of milk. They noticed that it was low in the early stages of the lactation; also that there was a rise from October to December, a fall from December to February and again a rise in February to March, but they could not correlate this fluctuation with any change in feed or any other factor and hence they thought it merely accidental. Holmes et al [1940] observed an increase in the first month, although the increase was not of much practical significance. Bartlet et al [1938] however found that the vitamin C level was very variable but was highest in the milk of cows fed on sprouted maize. Holmes et al [1941] have also recorded certain fluctuations which they correlated with advance in pregnancy. Here again, they found some difference from breed to breed, and there was a gradual fall in the vitamin content as pregnancy and lactation advanced. Karl Guggenheim [1940] observed a peak in the first half of the year, reaching the maximum in June-July which had no relation with feed. Thus the general conclusion is that feed has little effect on the vitamin C content, while breed, stage of lactation, etc., have some effect. In India comparatively little work has been done on the vitamin C content of milk. The few investigations that have been made give the impression that the milk of Indian cows and buffaloes is rather poor in vitamin C content as compared to the milk of the European breeds. Ghosh and Guha [1935] have reported the vitamin C content of cows milk as 0.007 mg/ml. Chakravarthy [1935] has also recorded the same figures while Ranganathan [1935] got a still lower value of 0.004 mg/ml. Ray et al [1941] found the average vitamin C content of milk to be 0.0194 mg. per ml. with a maximum of 0.0223 and minimum of 0.0133 mg. per ml. Even this is lower than the figures reported for the milk of European breeds. Kothavala and Gill [1943] alone report the vitamin C content of the milk of Indian cattle to be comparable to those recorded by western workers. Such great difference in the values for vitamin C content of milk might possibly be due to the difference in the method of collection of the samples, part of the vitamin C being destroyed in cases where the milk has been exposed to light or metal surfaces. However, no conclusive data are available regarding the vitamin C content of the milk of the different breeds of Indian Cattle, or the extent of variations in the vitamin C content of their milk due to breed, season of the year and stage of lactation and hence the present work was undertaken. EXPERIMENTAL Five animals were selected from each of the following breeds maintained at this Institute farm: Sindhi, Gir, Tharparkar, cross-bred cows and Murrah buffaloes. The animals were of almost the same age and were in the first or second week of the particular lactation. The usual concentrate ration of the institute herd consisting of a mixture of wheat bran, gram, gram husk and ground- nut cake, mixed in the proportion of 4.0:1.5:2.0:2.5, was fed to the animals at the rate of 1 lb. for every two pounds of milk yielded by the animal with a minimum of 3 lb. The roughage fed consisted of 55 lb. green grass (mixture of Guinea and Napier grasses) and 3 lb. of ragi straw for cows and 70 lb. of the same mixture of grasses and 3 lb. of ragi straw for buffaloes. Individual milk samples were collected in the morning in glass bottle coated outside with a thick layer of Japan black so that there was no chance of any action of light on the vitamin C content of the samples. Immediately the samples were analysed for their vitamin C content by the method of Bessey and King [1933]. To 20 ml. of milk, 5 ml. of 20 per cent trichloracetic acid were added; the mixture was then shaken well and filtered. Five millilitres of the clear filtrate was titrated against a standard solution of 2:6 185 I
186 Vitamin C Content of Milk dichlorophenol indophenol and vitamin C expressed as mg. of ascorbic acid per litre of milk. From a few preliminary trials it was found that fresh milk collected in dark bottles contained only a very negligible amount of reversibly oxidised ascorbic acid. The same observation was made by Ray et al [1941]. Hence only the reduced ascorbic acid was estimated in the experimental samples. The estimation of the vitamin was carried out every week for about 12 months when most of the animals went dry. The average vitamin C content of the milk of each breed for each month is calculated and presented in Table I.

These figures were also lower than the breed average or the herd average for the whole lactation. This is an agreement with the findings of Whitnah and Riddel [1937]. After the first month of the lactation, there was a gradual increase in the vitamin C content of the milk of all except cross-bred cows. This increase continued till the fourth month and there- after the values began to decline till the end of the eighth month when an increase was observed which was kept up till the end of lactation. In the case of the cross-bred cows, from the very first month, the values for vitamin C declined gradually till the eighth month when an upward trend occurred and this was maintained till the end of the lactation. The fluctuations observed in the vitamin C content of milk cannot be attributed to feed, since, the animals were receiving more-or-less the same feed throughout the experiment. Of the other factors that might influence the vitamin C content one is the season. In the present investigation two peak levels were observed, one in February and a still greater one in September, but in view of the more or less uniform climate of Bangalore, it may be reasonable to attribute these changes in vitamin C content of milk to lactational changes only. It will be observed that breed variations in the vitamin C content of milk are quite marked. The average vitamin C content of the milk of the different breeds of Indian cattle as observed in the present investigation compares very favourably with the figures reported by foreign workers for the milk of European breeds. Individual variations are observed in the vitamin C content of milk. In the case of the milk of Sindhi cows figures ranging from 21.9 mg. to 48.8 mg. of ascorbic acid per litre have been observed, but generally the range is much smaller. In the case of the other breeds also more or less the same
KERALA VERMA AND T. M. PAUL 187 degree of variation was observed in the vitamin C content of milk, but in the case of cross-bred and Tharparkar cows the values for vitamin C fluctuated within narrow limits. SUMMARY (1) The vitamin C content of the milk from Sindhi, Gir, Tharparkar and cross-bred cows and Murrah buffaloes have been studied for one complete lactation. (2) The average values obtained for the milk of the Indian cattle compare very favourably with the figures reported for European breeds. (3) The vitamin C content of the milk was low in all the breeds in the first month of lactation: peaks were observed the fourth month and towards the end of lactation.

SUMMARY Investigations have been carried out to find the possibility of feeding entrails as a total protein substitute for livestock. Entrails which are a rich source of protein and fat have been fed to Kumaoni bullocks as a sole source of digestible protein for a period of 10 weeks. During the observation period the adult animals maintained satisfactory health and live weights. The high digestibility coefficients of protein and ether extract (78.3 and 96.1, respectively) and the biological value, digestible protein and starch equivalent (87.5, 60.4 and 88.7, respectively) warrant its value as a high grade concentrate. It has been calculated that if all the waste from the healthy dead animals is utilized, the digestible protein is sufficient to feed 142.2 million adult animals (500 lb.) for one day or approximately four hundred thousand adult cattle for the whole year.

PROTECTIVE INOCULATION WITH DRY PIGEON-POX AND SHEEP AND GOAT-POX VACCINE By D. A. MUNRO, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 6 December 1946) IN view of the well established efficacy of dry pigeon-pox vaccine for protecting fowls against fowl-pox, it was considered desirable to test the effectiveness of this method against similar infections of sheep and goats. The observations which follow throw light on the method of producing immunity with the use of a dry vaccine on both sheep and goats, as well as on fowls and pigeons. Amongst the most prominent methods of protective inoculation against variola infections, the one which has been found most suitable, and is now almost universally practised for the control of goat and sheep-pox, is the use of a sensitised vaccine as recommended by Bridré and Boquet [1913]. The conception of this method of prophylactic treatment owed its origin to Besredka's classical findings in the field of sensitised vaccines. These authors [1933] have since published statistical returns to show that nearly 25 million doses of the vaccine have been issued from the Pasteur Institute, Algeria, for use in various countries during the twenty years following its introduction and the results have been consistently satisfactory not only in so far as judged by the protection conferred on vaccinated sheep, but also by the degree of safety with which the latter could be allowed to come in contact with untreated animals. In India. Viswanathan [1939] in Madras, reports his success in controlling an outbreak of sheep- pox by inoculating 2.388 sheep with the sensitised vaccine. The results obtained by him in goats, however, do not appear to have been satisfactory, for he writes: 'Out of .510 goats ovinated two died with symptoms of goat-pox, 20 developed severe generalized reaction and recovered and in the rest severe local reaction was present'. Chadha [1939], in the North-West Frontier Province, tested the value of this method of vaccina- tion on 77 sheep and found inflammatory reaction on the fifth day, with an elevation of body tempera- ture 105º-107ºF. In many cases the swellings reached the size of walnuts. The animals, however, eventually returned to normal health. While the introduction of the sensitised vaccine must be regarded as having registered a definite advance over the old method of 'ovination', a number of workers have referred to certain disadvantages of this method. Thus, Kolyali and Mavridis [1934] in Turkey, refered to the high cost of preparation of this vaccine and to the insufficiency of measures for its despatch, without loss of potency, to various parts of the country. Angeloff [1934] points out that the sensitised vaccine cannot be conserved and that, in spite of painstaking aseptic precau- tions in its preparation, there is a possibility of contaminating organisms developing during prolonged transit. Moreover it is not the case that animals treated by this method do not exhibit any symptoms. Thus, Suhaci [1939] states that, out of a total of 16.237 sheep vaccinated by the Bridré and Boquet method, nearly 73.75 per cent showed symptoms, though the latter were not generalized; 2.4-3.6 per cent of the animals showed nodules and many developed a transient lameness, while some showed depression and inappetence. Finally, as Bridré and Boquet [1933] themselves have pointed out, strains of sheep-pox virus vary in potency and this necessitates the use of varying quantities of serum for neutralizing a given quantity of virus. Kolyali and Mavridis [1934] later used sheep-pox virus treated with serum in the actual centre of the outbreak194 Protective Inoculation with Dry Pigeon-Pox parts of the world, has now almost been completely discarded and constitutes no more than an item of historical interest in literature on the subject, its serious drawback being, as is well known, that it sets up dangerous foci for spread of the disease owing to the severe reaction occurring in the inoculated animals. Similar remarks apply to the Borrel method [1930] which held the ground for many, years before the introduction of sensitised vaccine, for, as remarked by Bridré and Boquet [1933], the virus employed in this method ' is not a vaccine; its inoculation engenders sheep pox transmis- sible by simple contact and the lesion, even if unique, is a source of active virus'. Blane and Martin [1937] obtained inconstant results with the Borrel method in Morocean sheep when the latter were used as donors of the anti-serum required for use in this method. In India, Srikantiah [1936], states that he has employed the method successfully in 233 sheep. He, however, refers to the failure of its use by another worker in Madras during 1929-1930. Later, Srikantiah used what he designated the 'cutaneous method' of preparing sheep-pox vaccine: the infective material was applied on the scarified portion of the skin of a healthy sheep and the epithelial layers of the resultant pustules were removed by scraping from the 13th to the 16th day. Two cubic centimetres of 1:3 glycerine solu- tion was added to every gramme of the scrapings and the mixture preserved in cold storage, one part of the vaccine being diluted with two parts of saline at the time of despatch for field use. It would appear that two flocks out of three in which the vaccine was tested did not show any reaction and that eight of the sheep died; this being ascribed to some unknown accident having occurred to the vaccine. It has, however, been observed by the present writer that pustules which are formed after four or five days contain the maximum amount of virus and that, as will be seen from what has to be stated later, vaccine in wet suspension, even when preserved in cold storage, quickly loses its potency. It is more than probable that these factors contributed wholly or partially to the failure to obtain successful results by the 'cautaneous method'. The position in regard to protective inoculation against fowl-pox is more satisfactory, this being doubtless due to the widespread nature of the disease and the consequent availability of morbid material for experimentation, as also the obvious fact that birds are simpler and less expensive to experiment with. Of the more noticeable advances in this field, mention may be made of the intro- duction of pigeon-pox virus for use in fowls and of the so called 'stick method' of vaccination. Reference may also be made to the findings made by Beller [1931] on the specific nature of fowl-pox lesions as distinguished from those due to deficiency of vitamin A. It is also noteworthy that, contrary to the generally accepted view, Kliger and Aschner [1931] have stated that fowl-pox and avian diptheria represent distinct disease entities, so that recovery from one does not confer protec- tion against the other. If this statement is correct, then the percentage of success obtained with pigeon-pox virus against fowl-pox must have been substantially higher than what has been claimed for it in the past. It should, however, be mentioned that the relative value of fowl-pox and pigeon- pox virus still continues to be a subject of controversy. While, a priori, it would seem problematical whether a substantial degree of immunity is obtainable from the use of a heterologous vaccine, the actual experience of most workers points to a contrary conclusion. Thus James [1931], Glover [1931], Johnson [1932], Bierbaum [1935], Doyle [1935] and others refer to the highly satisfactory results obtained by them from its use, while, as will be seen from what has to be stated later, the present writer found it consistently effective in the experimental inoculation of fowls against pox. Michael [1932], Brunett [1933], and Lubbehusen and Ehlers [1934], record having found pigeon-pox virus to be of little value in protecting fowls, but as remarked by a number of later workers, their failures were in all probability due to faulty technique either in the preparation or in the application of the vaccine. It appears, however, generally agreed that the immunizing value of fowl-pox virus per se is superior to that of pigeon-pox virus, but that the use of the former is followed by a severe and sometimes fatal reaction, whilst egg production may be suspended altogether [James, loc. cit.]; Graham and Barger, 1936, Stafseth, [1931]. The danger of using fowl-pox virus is strikingly illus- trated by an instance cited by Leyhausen [1933] in which considerable mortality occurred in a flock of chicks inoculated with a proprietary pigeon-pox vaccine containing traces of fowl-pox virus whilst no untoward symptoms occurred in birds which received pigeon-pox vaccine alone supplied at the same time by the same firm. The use of fowl-pox virus would thus appear to be fraught with real
D. A. MUNRO 195 danger and the writer therefore used only pigeon-pox virus in the experiments to be presently described. According to Picard [1931], fowl-pox virus, by passaging through pigeons, may be attenuated and brought to a constant degree of virulence, so as to be suitable for inoculation with safety into fowls. Evidence produced more recently by Donatien and Lestoquard [1941], however, shows that the virus never reaches a fixed stage, but that it progressively loses its virulence, until the latter disappears altogether. An inquiry into the question of constancy of virulence of the virus was con- sidered by the writer hardly profitable to undertake, for, apart from the results reported by the last two named workers, a biological standardization of the virus to ensure constancy did not, at least, in theory, seem possible. In fact, Goodpasture and Anderson [1940] have shown that immunity against fowl-pox is a function of the humeral antibodies and not, even partially of the epithelial cells, so that, it may be inferred that the virulence varies with the quantity of antibodies elaborated by individual birds. Moreover, it would seem open to question whether, in practice a state of constancy in virulence is really desireable if, as has been postulated by Basset [1935], the immunity produced is directly proportional to the pathogenicity of the vaccine, for this may imply that, for conferring a strong immunity, the titre of the virus has to be adjusted in relation to the general condition of the bird so that the reaction may not progress to a fatal one. MATERIALS AND METHOD The skin of the abdomen of a sheep was shaved and thoroughly cleansed with warm water and soap and dried. A one per cent suspension of sheep-pox virus in normal saline solution was now rubbed into the superficial epithelial layer of the skin which had been lightly scarified. After four or five days, material from the pustules was collected aseptically by scraping in a receptacle and was then desiccated in vacuo over phosphorus pentoxide or calcium chloride. The process of drying was carried out in the cold as high temperatures have a deleterious effect on the keeping quality of the vaccine. The material was now weighed and ground to a powder in a sterile mortar. It was then stored both in the form of wet suspension and in the form of dried powder at two temperatures, viz., 42ºF. and 98.6ºF. The dry vaccine was prepared as follows before use. The material was rubbed to a smooth paste in a sterile mortar by the addition of a small quantity of 50 per cent glycerine saline. Sufficiently more of this diluent was now added to make the full quantity, which was then filtered through sterile muslin to remove extraneous matter and used the same day; 0.3 gm. of the dried vaccine suspended in the diluent was found sufficient for one hundred animals. A total of 110 animals were used in the present experiments and of these, 56 were sheep and 54 goats. The vaccinated animals were duly tested for immunity after an interval of 14 days. Controls were kept in each case. In the case of pigeons, the feather follicles of both legs were plucked, and immediately there- after a one per cent suspension of pigeon-pox virus in normal saline, was rubbed on to the denuded follicles. The crusts were collected from the 15th to the 21st day and the subsequent procedure was similar to that adopted in the preparation of sheep and goat vaccines as described above. The vaccinated birds were tested for immunity after 21 days by inoculating them with the specific virus. Controls were kept in each case. EFFECT OF VACCINATION Vaccination when carried out with a good sheep or goat vaccine usually resulted in a crop of vesicles at the site of inoculation resulting in a benign form of the disease. In a few sensitive patients the injection was followed by a period of dullness, loss of appetite, and fever, but this seldom lasted for more than a few days and the animal returned to normal after a short period of complete rest. The usual experience was, however, that no disturbance to health occurred in the animals that receive the protective inoculation. In some cases, when testing out brews of freshly prepared vaccine, the results were not as expected, the animal scarcely showing any reaction whatsoever. These animals when tested later with a potent virus failed to show any specific reaction, proving thereby that they were immune. The results are summarised in Table I. L2

In adult fowls the reaction is less marked, and at times almost imperceptible. The results obtained with the dry pigeon-pox vaccine are summarised in Table II. (a) In sheep It will be seen from Table I that out of a total of 14 sheep inoculated with the 'dry' vaccine that had been preserved in cold storage for varying periods, 11 (78.5 per cent) did not react when tested later for immunity, though the controls in each case developed the usual pustules following the virus inoculation. A total of six sheep were inoculated with the wet suspension kept at 42ºF. and only one of these reacted to the vaccine, showing the remarkable rapidity with which this form of vaccine loses its potency (Srikantiah, ante). The protective value of vaccine stored at 98.6ºF. was tested on eight sheep and none reacted to the inoculation, irrespective of the fact whether the vaccine used was in wet suspension or in the dried form, though six of these were found susceptible when tested later for immunity. In spite of the small number of tests, these results were considered sufficiently representative to warrant the conclusion that this temperature was quite unsuitable for storage of the vaccine and further tests along this line were not therefore proceeded with. (b) In goats It will be seen that a total of 18 goats were subjected to immunity test after they had received the protective inoculation with vaccine preserved at the lower temperature and that only seven proved resistant to the test. Five of the corresponding controls, however, did not react to the virus inoculation, so that the results in these cases must be regarded as inconclusive. The results obtained with vaccine stored at 98.6ºF. were in conformity with those obtained in sheep, for not one of the goats in this category reacted to the vaccine. Kolayli, Mavridis and Ilhami [1933] have recommended the utilization of sheep scab in vaccina- tion of goats and the use of variola virus of goats against pox of sheep, for in either case a benign form of the disease is produced by the vaccine and, furthermore, according to these authors, ' the virus of variola of goats is not transmitted by natural contagion from goat to sheep'. A series of experiments were carried out to test the value of this method of vaccination for both sheep and goats and the results are shown in Table III. It will be seen from Table III that ten sheep were inoculated with the specific vaccine and eight (80 per cent) did not react when later tested for immunity. On the other hand 10 goats were inoculated with sheep-pox vaccine and only four (40 per cent) proved immune on test. The protec- tive value of goat-pox vaccine was tested on ten goats and ten sheep and positive results were obtained in eight (80 per cent) and three (30 per cent) animals, respectively. These results justify the conclu- sion that though the two viruses are closely allied, neither of them can be used as a dependable agent for protecting the heterologous species. (c) In fowls It will be observed that the vaccine stored for the maximum period of six months at 42ºF. remains fully potent for fowls and pigeons, whereas a marked deterioration takes place when the vaccine is kept at 98.6ºF. Tests on the protective value of vaccine in the wet state were not carried out in this series of experiments for previous experience has shown that the wet vaccine issued to the field deteriorated rapidly. Besides as already mentioned, such vaccine had been found to be unsatisfac- tory in the case of sheep and goats. Brunett [1933] also refers to the gradual loss of virulence in pigeon-pox virus when the latter is suspended in glycerine saline and recommend its storage in the powdered form, being suspended in saline only when required for use. INDICATIONS FOR THE USE OF THE VACCINES Sheep and goat pox vaccines may be used in clean flocks when the disease is known to be in the immediate neighbourhood in order to limit the spread of infection.

It may also be used in clean flocks where the disease tends to linger on. On the other hand, inoculations are better not performed on healthy animals if there is no immediate danger, for, as already mentioned, a benign form of the disease is set up after vaccina- tion, and a sick animal is likely to spread the disease to other animals which have not been inoculated. As for the fowl-pox vaccine, it should not be used in pigeons in a debilitated state, as the vaccine in such cases is capable of setting up the disease in a generalized form. SUMMARY Sheep and goat-pox vaccines stored in the form of a dried powder remains potent for the purpose of protective inoculation for not less than six months, and similar results were obtained with a dried pigeon-pox vaccine. When stored in wet suspension, sheep and goat-pox vaccines lose their potency within a month. Sheep-pox vaccine has not proved to be a dependable agent for protecting goats, and goat-pox vaccine for protecting sheep. REFERENCES Angelofl, (1934). Berl. tierarztl. Wschr. 50,189-191 Basset, J.

LALL, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S., Assistant Animal Husbandry Commissioner with the Government of India* (Received for publication on 21 January 1947) (with five text figures) BASU [1945] collected the data concerning surra in all species of animals under three headings, i.e., bovines, equines and others from the year 1942 to 1944 from various provinces and States, showing the intensity of infection in the various areas. From his figures the Punjab seems to be the worst affected area, followed by the United Provinces and Sind. In this note data for the last 14 years (1932-44) has been collected from the five divisions of the Punjab (Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Ambala and Jullundur) and an effort has been made to work out correlation between rainfall (the average of figures for last 14 years) and the incidence of surra, if any. Table I and Fig. 1* indicate that there is no direct relationship between rainfall and the number of surra cases. The number of surra cases is more or less constant. If anything there is a fall in the incidence** of the disease in heavy rainfall years. No doubt there is a seasonal occurrence of the disease, i.e., there is increase just after the rainy season, as can be seen from Fig. 2. The low incidence in heavy rainfall years may be due to the washing away of eggs and larvae of the insect vectors. The abnormal fall in the number of surra cases recorded in the years 1943 and 1944 is due to the fact that naganol was not available. This point is discussed in detail later. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 1. Co-relation between rainfall and incidence of surra. Seasonal incidence. The. figures for each month for the last 14 years have been computed and the average calculated. It will be seen from Table II and Fig. 2 that the number of surra cases start increasing in August and reach their zenith in October. The peak is reached in September in Ambala, Multan and Rawalpindi and in October in Lahore and Jullundur (see Fig. 3A and Table II). The figures available for Assam and the Central Provinces for the last two years also indicate a similar seasonal curve. On the other hand, in the seasonal curve drawn by Basu (ibid) on the basis of total figures, the peak is reached earlier in September then in our case, viz. in October. The separate figures for horses and camels were available for Jullundur division only in which case a separate figure has been drawn (Fig. 3B), which shows that the peak in the cases of the equines is reached in 201 M
202 Seasonal Incidence of Surra October and in camels in September. These curves are similar to those for equines and others, obtained by Basu (ibid.) According to Basu the peak in bovines is reached in August, while from the data supplied by Zargar (personal communication) for the years 1940-1943, the peak in bovines in the Central Provinces is reached in September. This may be due to variable climatic factors such as earlier rainfall at one place as compared to the other. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 2.

H. K. LALL 203 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 3. Seasonal incidence of surra. When the figures of incidence of surra are compared each year, it is seen that peak is reached in the same month each year, with occasional minor variations. The average rainfall has also been worked out monthwise on the basis of the rainfall figures of the last 14 years and plotted against the number of average outbreaks each month. These figures show that surra has no direct relation to rainfall as previously stated but its incidence is increased in the months usually after the summer monsoons in the Punjab. It is known that trypanosomes feed by osmosis on the glucose of blood which is naturally mobilised from the store, i.e., the liver, and that there is hyperglycaemia in the early stages of trypanosome in- fection and hyperglycaemia in the latter stages when the trypanosomes usually disappear. Ray (personal communication) pointed out to the author that there is a seasonal variation in the blood sugar of equines. The seasonal incidence of the disease and seasonal variation in the quantity of blood sugar and the increase in the number of flies and other insects during the surra season throw some light on the epizootology of the disease. It seems from the histopathology of the disease studied on a few cases by Ray and Lall in 1944 (unpublished) that the lesions produced in chronic cases of surra are pathogonomics of sugar-glycogen metabolic disorders and its further study204 Seasonal Incidence of Surra number of cases are fewer in the dry climate of Multan as compared to that of Ambala and Lahore where the climate is more humid and there are extensive low lying areas. The last factor seems to be the deciding factor, as far as surra is concerned. The total rainfall in Lahore and Rawalpindi and Ambala divisions is approximately the same, but there is a difference in the number of cases (on the average basis per 10,000 heads of equine and camel population) in each division. Jullundur, having a much heavier rainfall, has more or less the same incidence as Rawalpindi. The peak is reached in October in Lahore and Jullundur, in September in Ambala, Rawalpindi and Multan (see Fig. 3A); this is very probably owing to the larger camel population in these divisions, because in the case of camels peak is reached in September. In Ambala, which has proportionately a large camel population, it is noticed from the records that the majority of the surra infected animals brought to hospitals were camels. In the divisions where the camel population is considerable in proportion to equines, the peak is not well defined. It is seen from the monthly rainfall curves (the average of 1935H. K.

SUMMARY The data of surra cases in the Punjab, for the year 1932-1944 has been analysed and its seasonal and geographical distribution discussed the study of the relevant records in the Punjab points to the facts that there is no quantitative relationship between the incidence of surra and the annual rainfall, and that the incidence of the disease always increases after rainfall, indicating the need of prophylactic treatment for one or two months following for summer monsoon. There is a decline in the number of surra cases presented for treatment following the cessation of the use of naganol, it appears that owners will forego treatment rather than submit to one which causes some inconvenience; it, therefore, follows that simplicity of treatment should take pre- cedence over the ultimate total effectiveness of the treatment or should at least be considered as equally important to it.

A NEW METHOD FOR THE STUDY OF EXTENSION IN WOOL FIBRE By P. N. NANDA, M.R.C.V.S., and TARLOK SINGH, B. Sc. (HONS.), M. Sc., Government Livestock Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 6 May 1946) (With plate III and one text figure) STRENGTH and elasticity form two of the most important qualities of wool, as the strength and weaving properties of the fabric are dependent upon them. Whether a fabric is fine or coarse, it must handle elastic and lofty. The term elasticity, as applied to wool, denotes the power is possesses to assume its normal condition after being subjected to stress. Its exact determination may be made by the measure of the limit upto which the fibre extends when under stress. For the measurement of strength in wool fibres, Oneill Hair Tester, originally devised by Charles Oneill [1863] is being used in this Farm Laboratory and it is described in detail in the Textile Journal. As regards extension, however, very little information is available. In the course of our experiments on the measurement of fibre strength, we were able to introduce a subsidiary contrivance within the apparatus without altering it in any way. With the help of this contrivance, it is possible to measure the maximum length to which a fibre or a portion of the fibre extends before it snaps. The contrivance, as shown in Figs. 1-3, consists of the following four parts: (i) The support, a thin cylindrical piece of wood about half an in. long, having a longitudinal hole in the centre, which goes as deep as its middle (Fig. 1). The support is tied to the cork of the float of the tester with the help of a thread as shown in Plate III. The lower end of the support is made to remain above the level of the water when the float is freely and vertically suspended in it. (ii) The rider consisting of a piece of fine metallic wire bent at right angles at both ends, one arm being longer than the other (Fig. 2). The shorter arm fits into the hole of the support while the longer arm carries the index at its end. (iii) The index, a crescent shaped metallic piece, the inner curvature of which is the same as the curvature of the outer tube of the tester (Fig. 3). It has a hole in the middle in which the end of the longer arm of the rider is fixed. The index moves along the scale. (iv) The scale marked in inches (1/10th) on an ordinary piece of white paper, which is rendered water-proof by giving it a dip in hot paraffin. The scale is pasted on the outer surface of the cylinder of the tester at its upper end. Figs. 1-3. Parts Oneill Hair Tester 1210 Study of Extension in Wool Fibre Working When the apparatus is in use, it operates as shown in Plate III. The fibre to be tested is mounted on paper mounts, the ends of the fibre being secured with sealing wax at a distance of one inch apart. This length is selected as a standard for comparative study. The paper is then fixed in the hooks provided in the apparatus. Along with the fibre, the rider is also put in the hole of the support. After fixing the upper fixed point of the apparatus, the initial reading at which the pointed end of the index stands is taken. Readings are taken upto two decimal places, the second place being estimated by judgment. Water is then allowed to flow out of the tester as a result of which pressure is exerted on the fibre and it extends. On account of the extension, the tube moves down, and with it the index also glides downwards along the scale. A careful watch is kept on the movement of the index. Just when the fibre breaks, reading at the scale is noted. The difference between the initial and the final readings on the scale gives the limit up to which the fibre extended per unit inch. The water taken out for breaking the fibre is measured in c.c. and the breaking load is calculated by the formula: F = Vr2/ R2Indian J. Vet.

Results are given in Table I. Conclusions regarding the consistency of the data were drawn from these results by applying the analysis of variance according to the method suggested by Fisher [1941]. Assuming that every set of ten fibres represented the bulk population to which it belonged, and the fibres used in every set or trial were uniform as regards their characteristics, the results obtained can be considered as reliable.

The same result was obtained in case of sample No. 1. It is, therefore, established that the method gave similar results with both trials. Slight fluc- tuations in readings may be partly attributed to atmospheric variations and partly to the fibre charac- teristic variation. The experiment was conducted under room temperature, facilities for conditioning the samples being not available. (b) Trials by different observers. The question next arises whether or not the method can be reliably used by other workers. This point was also investigated in the manner noted below. A small portion, representative of the bulk, was further separated from sample No. 2 referred to above. This was divided into five lots each consisting of approximately 10-20 fibres. It is not difficult to judge the number of fibres in small samples by experience. From each lot, a set of ten fibres was drawn out at random and the five sets so obtained were allotted to five different observers, three of them being research workers including one mathematician and two laboratory boys. They were asked to break the fibres independently and note down the extension results. Tables IV-V show the results and their Analysis of variance:P. N. NANDA AND TARLOK SINGH 213 SUMMARY A subsidiary contrivance has been devised and added to Oneill Hair Tester. Besides strength, the apparatus can now be used for the measurement of extension of the wool fibres. The contrivance described is simple and records extension on a magnified scale. It gives consistent results which are independent of personal errors. REFERENCES Osumi, Gohachi and Kato, Etsuro. (1937). J. Text. Inst., 28, T 129 Oneill, Charles (1863). J. Text.

The observations made have been recorded in the various annual reports of the officers, but it has been considered advisable to present the results in a consolidated form, especially because Polding's [1943] publication dealing with incidence of Brucellosis in India does not cover Bengal and Assam. Moreover, though the broader features of the abortion disease in organized herds in Bengal have been found similar to those noted elsewhere, some of the observations have been quite interesting and instructive. METHODS In the earlier period, from 1934 to 1941, the investigations were restricted chiefly to one or two important herds, at least one of which suffered a serious outbreak of abortions and still-births. Speci- mens of blood serum taken from aborting and other animals of these herds, were, from time to time, and often repeatedly, despatched to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar, where they were subjected to the standard tube agglutination test. Later on, from 1942 to 1945, when periodical consignments of suitable antigen and a portable outfit for a quick slide agglutination test were received from Mukteswar, the survey was extended to some more, herds located in different parts of the Province. Unpreserved specimens of blood serum, generally from all available adult stock and sometimes including a few grown-up calves, were tested on the spot within a few to 24 hours, taking the usual precautions. The reactions obtained were mostly clear-cut and the percen- tage of doubtful reactions was small. While some consignments of antigen went bad comparatively soon, others remained well and discriminatingly agglutinable (checked against fresher consignments) for long periods, in one case for more than a year at room temperature. The occurrence of positive reactions in any herd was regarded rather as an indication of the presence of infection in the herd than a correct and dependable index of the extent of infection. The herd owners were advised accordingly and, where necessary, suitable hygenic control measures were prescribed. RESULTS The main results are summarized in Table I. Brief notes concerning individual herds and history of abortions, etc. in them are also given. It will be seen that out of thirteen herds tested, Brucella infection was definitely demonstrated in only eight. Herd No. 1, originally composed of Welsh and Sahiwal cattle and believed to have been previously free from infection, suffered a serious out- break of the disease following the introduction of a batch of Jersey cattle from Australia in February 1934. The following figures give an idea about the spread of the disease in this herd.

218 Brucellosis in Dairy Herds in Bengal [XVII Evidently, the infection was introduced along with the imported animals, spread rapidly among the original (more susceptible) stock and later also among the imported stock. This serves as a typical example of the dangers to which a previously uninfected herd is exposed when indiscriminate additions are made. Among the herds tested, there were two buffalo herds. Like their counterpart cattle herds, and in keeping with the history of abortions in them, one was found free from infection and in the other, out of 45 animals tested, there were fourteen positive and three doubtful reactors. DISCUSSION It was originally planned to test a large number of herds, but it was soon realized that that was neither practicable, since some herd owners could not be persuaded to the test, nor necessary, because in many herds abortions were reported to be either absolutely unknown over long spans of years or too few and far between to warrant a suspicion of Brucellosis. A majority of the herds left out was small, well isolated and practically self-contained units, in contrast with many of the larger herds in which abortions have been occurring frequently and to which indiscriminate additions have been made from time to time. Thus, while actual testing of a few herds of the former class has shown them to be free from demonstrable infection, even in the face of a few sporadic abor- tions, a varying incidence of positive reactions has been encountered in many herds of the latter class. As expected, the highest percentage of infection was in a pinjrapole herd which is constituted on lines welcoming all sorts of animals at all times.

One of the two buffalo herds examined was found positive with over 30 per cent reactors. The results corresponded well with history of abortions, etc. While the incidence of abortions and percentage of reactors were comparatively high in bigger commercial and other herds welcoming frequent additions, these were low or nil in many smaller self·contained herds. Majority of the herds in Bengal belong to the latter class. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Herds Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were tested at Mukteswar through blood serum sent by my predecessors Messrs M. B.

THE RELATIVE RATE OF ABSORPTION OF DIFFERENT OILS AND FATS By V. R. BHALERAO, D. VENKATAPPIAH and C. P. ANANTAKRISHNAN, Imperial Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 16 December 1946) THE relative nutritive value of natural oils and fats is generally judged by the rate of a ssimilation and the percentage of utilization in the body. With regard to the rate of absorption of different fats, a number of investigations have been reported. Steenbock et al [1936] determined the comparative rate of absorption of different fats in experiments with rats following the technique of Irwin et al [1936] and indicated that in general lard and hydrogenated oils were absorbed at approx- imately the same rate, while butter oil, halibut liver oil and codliver oil were absorbed at a more rapid rate. Irwin et al [1936] found that hydrogenation decreased the rate of absorption of an oil, but the variations in the melting point below body temperature were without effect. Basu and Nath [1946] found that there existed a real difference in the rate of absorption of cow butter fat, mustard oil, cocoanut oil, sesame oil and groundnut oil in a four hour period, but after six hours all the fats were absorbed almost to the same extent. The present communication deals with the rate of absorption of the fats commonly occurring in India namely of butter fats of cow, buffalo, goat and sheep of edible oils ; sesame, groundnut ; cocoa- nut, safflower, mustard and cotton seed, of vanaspathies from groundnut, sesame and cottonseed oils and of the body fats from cow, buffalo, goat and sheep. EXPERIMENTAL The technique of Irwin et al [1936] was adopted. Adult rats from 4 to 7 months old weighing about 200 gm. were fasted for 48 hours, during which period water was given ad libitum. With the help of the stomach tube, 1.5 c.c. of melted fat was then delivered into the stomach. In a similar way 1.5 c.c. of the fat was delivered into beaker and weighed. The average of three such weighings was taken as the weight of the fat fed. At the end of four hours after feeding the fat, rats were decapitated and the abdominal cavity opened. The stomach, intestine and caecum were removed immediately from the body cavity. Each section was filled with distilled water and after ten minutes the contents were emptied in a beaker. The sections were then filled with petroleum ether (40°C.222 Rate of Absorption of Oils and Fats [XVII It was found that at the end of four hours the stomach of the animals fed body fats contained a visible hard fat. This lower rate of absorption is probably due to the high melting point of the fat as seen from Table II.

With regard to edible oils, mustard oil is found to be least absorbed while sesame and cocoanut oils happened to be absorbed to the same extent as cow ghee. The other oils, safflower, groundnut and cotton seed, though they were absorbed to a lesser degree than cow ghee, did not show any significant difference. Vanaspathies, in general, are found to be less absorbed. If the rates of absorption of groundnut vanaspathies are taken into consideration, it is seen that as the melting point of the sample increases from 34.1°C. to 39.0°C, the absorption correspondingly decreases from 36.5 per cent to 33.6 per cent Though the sample having a melting point of 34.1°C. compared favourably well with groundnut oil, the rates of abosrption of other two vanaspathhies were significantly lower. The rates of absorp- tion of the sesame as well as cotton seed vanaspaties showed the same trend, i.e., higher the melting point, the lower was the rate of absorption. This discrepancy in the rates of absorption of different fats can be partly explained by following closely the changes that take place in a fat as digestion proceeds. This has been done by analyzing the intestinal residues from each group for B. R. Index, saponification value and the iodine values and the data are shown in Table II. A glance at Table II reveals clearly that there is an increase in the B. R. Index and a lowering of the iodine value in the residual fat.

It is also seen from Table II, that there is a lowering in the saponification value and Reichert- Meissel value of the butter fats. Though the differences are not large, there is an indication that the short chain fatty acids are more readily absorbed than the long chain fatty acids. There is not so much lowering in the iodine value as in the case of oils or vanaspathies indicating preferential ab- sorption in the gastro-intestinal tract of the short chain acids as compared to the unsaturated acids in case of butter fats. The presence of lower fatty acids in the butter fats is a probable explanation of their quicker absorption as compared to the other fats. Cocoanut oil also behaves in the same way as butter fats, as is seen from the fact that the saponification value of the residual fat is lowered considerably from 259.0 to 231.4 indicating a quicker absorption of the lower acids. In case of the body fats there is no definite indication except the fact that the unsaturated acids are absorbed proportionately more as evident from the slight lowering of the iodine value of the undigested fat. There is a marked change in the nature of edible oils during the digestion. The iodine value is almost reduced to two-thirds in all the oils except cocoanut oil. This leads to the conclusion that the un- saturated acids, namely oleic and linoleic, are more readily digested than the saturated acids.
224 Rate of Absorption of Oils and Fats [XVII The lowering of absorption of the oils by hydrogenation may be explained by chemical changes that are brought about during the process. The linoleic acid is converted to oleic and iso-oleic acid and finally into stearic acid, thus the proportion of oleic and linoleic acids gradually decrease with a proportionate increase in the stearic acid content. This lowering of the unsaturated acid contents in the fat is probably responsible for the lowering of its rate of absorption. It is thus seen from the results that the short chain fatty acids and the unsaturated acids, particularly oleic and linoleic acids, are more readily absorbed than the long chain saturated fatty acids in four hours absorption period. SUMMARY The realtive rate of absorption of cow, buffalo, goat and sheep butter fats, the body fats of cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, the vegetable oils, cocoanut, sesame, groundnut, cottonseed, safflower and mustard, the hydrogenated groundnut oils of melting points of 34.1°C., 37.0°C. and 39.0°C., the hydro- genated sesame oils of melting points of 37.1°C., 38.7°C., 39.3°C. and the hydrogenated cottonseed oils of melting points of 35.5°C., 37.3°C. and 38.5°C. were determined after four hours by feeding 1.5 c.c. of each fat. The undigested fats in the alimentary canal were also examined for their chemical characteristics. It was found that sesame oil and cocoanut oils were absorbed at the same rate as cow butter fat, while sheep butter fat, safflower oil, groundnut oil and cottonseed oil were absorbed somewhat more slowly, but the absorption was not significantly less than that of cow ghee. All the body fats and hydrogenated oils were significantly less absorbed as compared with cow ghee. It was also found that hydrogenation lowered the rate of absorption of an oil. It is suggested that the short chain fatty acids are more readily absorbed than the long chain fatty acids and among the long chain fatty acids, the unsaturated acids are more readily absorbed than the saturated acids.

RESAZURIN TEST FOR ASSESSING THE STERILITY OF DAIRY UTENSILS By F. D. AIBARA and H. LAXMINARAYANA, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 13 June 1947) IT is well known that dairy utensils and milk plant, which are not thoroughly cleaned and efficiently sterilized, represent the most important sources of bacterial contamination in milk. Accordingly the efficiency of the methods of cleansing and sterilization in a dairy is required to be checked periodically by testing the equipment and utensils for sterility. For this purpose the plate counts of either the rinsings or of swabs are most widely employed. Since absolute sterility, i.e. complete freedom from all living organisms, is impracticable under commercial conditions, maximum limits of plate counts are allowed for different types of utensils varying from 10 per ml. of rinse solution in the case of bottles to 100 per ml. for milk pails and 500 per ml. for churns [Chalmers, 1945]. An official technique for the examination of washed churns and suitable limits of plate counts for evaluat- ing the efficiency of farm sterilization methods have also been prescribed by the British Ministry of Agriculture [1943]. The plate count method is, however, complicated and involves considerable delay in obtaining results. The presumptive coliform test which has also been used for the purpose is not found to be of much value, particularly in the case of bottles [Mattick and Hoy, 1937 ; Bark- worth, 1941]. Thomas [1943] suggested the use of resazurin as a simpler and quicker test for detecting churn sterility. The method was subsequently modified by Davis and Watson [1943], according to whom the rinse solution from the churn is added to sterile separated milk and incubated at 22°C. for 24 hours. The incubated sample is then subjected to the resazurin test and if the colour is not reduced to a lilac shade (disc 5) in half an hour, it is an indication of a satisfactory degree of sterility in the churn. Discs 5 to 3½ are taken to denote a ' doubtful' condition while reduction to disc 3 or below is an index of unsatisfactory condition. A good agreement between these resazurin standards and the plate count limits laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture was found by Davis and Watson. The application of this test for examining the common dairy utensils used for handling milk in this country would be of great practical value in improving the bacteriological quality of market milk. Some modifications in the technique and interpretation of the test may, however, be called for in view of the different climatic and environmental conditions prevailing here. The present study was carried out with the object of examining the suitability and reliability of the resazurin test in comparison with plate counts for determining the sterility of bottles, milk pails, churns, receiving tank and cooler. EXPERIMENTAL The tests were carried out on milk bottles (½ lb. and 1 lb.), milk pails (10 lb.), churns (100 lb.) receiving tank and cooler (surface type) after cleaning and sterilizing them in the following manner so as to produce in them degrees of sterility ordinarily found in utensils handled in commercial dairies.

In the case of the cooler, the whole surface was thoroughly scrubbed with a sterile brush using 500 ml. solution for the purpose. The utmost precautions were observed so as to carry out the opera- tions under aseptic conditions and absolutely sterile apparatus was used for performing the tests. Slight exposure to outside contamination could not, however, be avoided in the case of the receiving tank and cooler. In all the trials controls were employed and wherever extraneous contamination was suspected, the results of such experiments were discarded. Plate counts. Portions of the rinsings (1 ml. and 3 ml. in the case of sterile utensils and suitable dilutions in other cases) were plated in triplicate on milk agar. The plates were incubated at 37°C. for 48 hours and averages of the colony counts taken excluding those showing more than 20 per cent discrepancies. Presumptive coliform test. Portions of the rinsings in appropriate serial dilutions were tested for the presence of coliform bacteria in McConkey broth tubes (duplicate) after 48 hours' incubation. Negative tubes were incubated for another 48 hours and the reactions noted. Resazurin test. One ml. portion of the rinse solution was added to 10 ml. sterile separated milk (aged for not less than two weeks) and then incubated at 22°C. for 24 hours. The incubated sample was then thoroughly shaken, one ml. of 0.005 per cent resazurin solution added and the resazurin colour changes at 37°C. after 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes observed using the standard Com- parator for comparing the colours [Davis and. Watson, loc. cit.]. In the course of the preliminary trials with bottles, it was found that the incubated samples in respect of both the washed and partially sterilized series, invariably showed a rapid resazurin reduc- tion (pink or colourless) in 30 minutes. This was probably due to the long incubation of 24 hours allowing an undue development of the initial flora. Furthermore, any substantial shortening of this period would help in considerable saving of time in obtaining the results. Accordingly other time- temperature combinations for incubating the rinse samples were tried out. Of these, incubation for 16 hours at 22°C. was found to give most satisfactory results and was also convenient as it corres- ponded with the farm routine. Hence the resazurin test was carried out on rinse samples incubated for 16 hours at 22°C. RESULTS The mean colony counts (per ml. of rinse solution) obtained in respect of different utensils and the corresponding resazurin reduction stages at the end of 30 minutes, one hour and two hours are given in Table I. The resazurin colour shades (blue, lilac, mauve, pink mauve, purple pink, pink and white) are expressed in terms of disc numbers 6 to 0 (indicated on the resazurin. comparator) for facilitating interpretation. There was no appreciable colour change at the end of 10 minutes due to the interval being too short and the reduction after three hours had invariably advanced to either a pink or colourless stage in almost all cases. Hence these observations are not included in the data. The results of the coliform test for each group of samples are also given. It is seen that the resazurin colour changes (disc numbers) are fairly comparable with plate counts in bringing out the marked difference between washed and sterilized utensils in their standards of cleanliness. There is, however, some discrepancy observed in the case of one lb. bottles since the washed series also show high disc numbers comparable to those of the sterilized ones. By increas- ing the period of sterilization from one hour to two and four hours slightly higher disc numbers are obtained. The plate counts for all the groups of sterilized bottles, with the exception of half pound bottles subjected to sterilization for one hour, are below 10 per ml. of rinse solution [satisfactory standard according to Chalmers, 1945] and the corresponding resazurin disc numbers are above

Out of 25 utensils satisfying the plate count standard, 22 are passed by the resazurin test and of 32 utensils failing on the former scale only 20 are condemned by the latter test. On the other hand 20 out of 23 utensils failing the resazurin test are also condemned on the plate count standard. Thus, the resazurin test, although capable of detecting most of the efficiently or inefficiently sterilized vessels, fails to pick out an appreciable number of samples condemned on the plate count. This anomaly is easily explained considering that (a) the slightest contamination occurring at the time of plating and other inevitable sources of error in the technique will give rise to a higher count without affecting the reduction test to the same degree, and (b) the flora surviving inefficient sterilization in. some cases (e.g. bottles) may be of an inert type without much influence on the reduction of resazurin. Accordingly the resazurin test would appear to be less sensitive and accurate than plate count in detecting faulty methods, while it is more reliable in indicating the presence of actively reducing types of organisms that have survived in the containers and which are apt to bring down the keeping quality of milk. In any case failure of the utensils to pass the resazurin standard is a definite indica- tion of inefficient methods and this factor is of sufficient practical value in controlling the operations under commercial conditions. It is possible that many samples condemned by the resazurin test may come under the ' doubtful' class suggested by Davis and Watson [loc cit.]. The present data have not provided any basis for fixing up an intermediate standard. If the object of applying the test is to determine whether the method of washing and sterilization of utensils is effective enough or not, the provision of any such intermediate grade has no practical significance. Further application of the test under actual com- mercial conditions is necessary for elucidating the above point. SUMMARY The applicability of the resazurin test for assessing the sterility of dairy utensils, e.g. bottles, milk pails, churns, receiving tank and cooler, as a means of checking the efficiency of the cleansing and sterilization methods in the dairy has been examined. 2. The resazurin test was carried out on rinsings (1 ml. mixed with 10 ml. sterile separated milk and then incubated at 22°C. for 16 hours) and the colour changes in half an hour (at 37°C.) fairly agreed with the plate counts of the rinsings. Resazurin reduction to a stage not lower than disc 5 (lilac shade) was an indication of satisfactory quality in all the utensils.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY IN THE USE OF DIFFERENT MEDIA FOR THE ESTIMATION OF COLIFORM ORGANISMS IN MILK BY M. A. KRISHNASWAMY AND H. LAXMINARAYANA, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 26 August 1946) IN VIEW of the great importance attached to the presence of members of the coli-aerogenes group in milk and milk products, the attention of workers in the field has been focussed on the develop- ment of suitable methods for their detection and estimation. The dilution extinction method (originally introduced by Lister) using various liquid media has been widely employed for the purpose and recently plating on solid media for the enumeration of coliform organisms and the direct differentia- tion of coli and aerogenes types have also come into practice. Most of the media were originally- introduced for water analysis and subsequently suggested for the examination of milk. MacConkey's lactose peptone bile broth [1905 and 1908] has been almost exclusively used for the presumptive coliform test in England [Ministry of Agriculture, 1934] while in the United States a standard lactose broth, differing from the former mainly in the omission of bile salt, was in general use for a long time. The serious drawbacks of the latter medium in permitting the growth of other types of organisms and giving many false positives were realized early and this led to the introduction by various American workers of several selective liquid media, which, while permitting the growth of coliform bacteria, would inhibit other organisms. Two of these namely, two per cent brilliant green bile broth [Jordan, 1927] and formate ricinoleate broth [Stark and England, 1935] have been generally regarded as most satisfactory [Farrell, 1937 ; McCrady and Langevin, 1932 ; McCrady and Archambault, 1934; Noble and White, 1935; Babel and Parfitt, 1936] and they are now re- commended for the presumptive coliform test in the bacteriological examination of milk in the United States [American Public Health Association, 1941]. Solid media were originally employed for differentiating between the various members of the coli-aerogenes group and confirmation of positive broth tubes in the presumptive test. MacConkey's agar [1905] has been most commonly employed in England for the purpose, although several other selective media namely, Eijkman's medium, Simmon's citrate agar and Koser's citrate medium, have also been used for distinguishing between the two groups [Wilson and colleagues, 1935]. In other countries, Endo's [1904] medium, litmus lactose agar, Levine's [1918] eosin methylene blue agar and recently violet red bile agar (Difco laboratories, U.S.A.) and desoxycholate agar [Liefson, 1935] have been widely used. The employment of solid media for the enumeration of coliform organisms and direct differentia- tion of coli and aerogenes types have received attention only recently. Its main advocates have been Tonney and Noble [1932] who recommended a complex ferrocyanide citrate agar medium. Kon [1932-33] could not get clear-cut results on any of the solid media suggested by previous workers. Wilson et al [loc. cit.] conclude that MacConkey's medium (whether liquid or solid) is of great value in the estimation of coliform bacilli. According to McCrady and Archambault [loc. cit.], Bartram and Black [1937], Babel and Parfitt [loc. cit.] and Miller and Pricket [1938] violet red bile agar gives most satisfactory results in 24 hours, while Chilson and Eglinton [1936] and Yale [1937] advocate the use of desoxycholate agar. The last two media namely, violet red bile agar and desoxycholate agar, have now been recommended for the presumptive coliform test in milk and eosin methylene blue or Endo's agar for subsequent isolation of colonies for confirmation and identification [American Public Health Association, 1941]. Although no legal standards or official methods for the bacteriological examination of milk have been prescribed in India, the presumptive coliform test using MacConkey's broth [Ministry of Agriculture, 1934] is employed in certain public health and dairy laboratories for assessing the hygienic quality of water and milk. Cunningham and Raghavachari [1924] and Raghavachari [1926] studied the application of some recent methods of differentiating lactose fermenting organisms 231 E
232 Comparative Study in the Use of Different Media [ XVII in faeces, soil, milk and water under Indian conditions and found that MacConkey's bile salt lactose broth was the most suitable medium for the purpose. A similar conclusion has been reached by Raghavachari and Sitarama Iyer [1934, 1936 and 1939], who examined the use of several media for estimating coliform contamination in water. In his studies on the types of colon organisms present in milk supplies in Pusa, Walton [1931] used MacConkey's broth with litmus as a selective medium for the detection and growth of coliforms and Endo's agar for confirming them. The use of solid media for estimating coliform organisms in Indian milks does not seem to have received atten- tion. There is thus considerable divergence of opinion as to the best medium for carrying out the presumptive coliform test in milk. While the English workers favour McConkey's broth, the American authors recommended several liquid as well as solid media for the purpose. The most suitable one from among them may be selected and adopted for use in this country. It is well known that the nature of bacterial flora developing in milk is characteristic of the climatic and environmental conditions and since India differs so widely from the western countries in these respects, any bacterio- logical test or medium evolved there must be examined for its applicability as well as reliability in testing Indian milks before accepting it with confidence. Accordingly the present study was under taken with a view to compare some of the well-known liquid and solid media available for the estimation of coliform organisms in milk. EXPERIMENTAL Media compared. The following media, which could be obtained locally or prepared in th laboratory from available materials, were compared for estimating the coliform organisms in milk by the dilution and plating methods : Liquid media MacConkey's broth Formate ricinoleate broth Brilliant green bile broth Solid media MacConkey's agar Endo's agar Eosin methylene blue agar Violet red bile agar With the exception of MacConkey's broth, the media were constituted from the Difco dehydrated products (U.S.A.). The MacConkey's broth was prepared in this laboratory according to the formula given by Chalmers [1945]. In the course of the investigation, the Difco preparation of MacConkey's agar was exhausted early and further quantities could not be obtained. Some preliminary trials were, therefore, under- taken to prepare the medium in this laboratory. A medium prepared from ordinary ingredients according to the formula given by Chalmers [1945] or using Difco formula gave very unsatisfactory results. The chief trouble seems to lie with the quality of peptone, bile salt and indicators, as a result of which characteristic colonies of coliform organisms could not be obtained and other types of organisms could not be prevented from growing on the medium and giving misleading results. Ultimately the following composition, employing Difco ingredients and a suitable concentration of the indicators, was found to give satisfactory results comparable with those yielded by the dehydrated product and was adopted in subsequent work : Bacto-peptone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 gm.

XVIII] M. A. KRISHNASWAMY AND H. LAXIMINARAYANA 233 Presumptive test. Three successive tenfold dilutions of the milk sample (corresponding to its general level of bacteriological quality) were prepared in saline water in the usual manner, i.e., by adding one ml. of milk to 9 ml. of saline water for making 10-1 ml. dilution and preparing further dilutions from the latter. Where the dilution series started from 10-2 ml., one ml. of original milk was added to 99 ml. water to make up 10-2 ml. dilution and subsequent dilutions made from it in the same manner. One ml. portions of each dilution were inoculated into the three broth (liquid media) tubes in triplicate and also plated in duplicate on the four solid media. After the agar had selidified in the petri dishes about 4 ml. of the same medium was peured over it in order to prevent the formation of atypical surface colonies. The broth tubes as well as the plates were incubated at 37°C. and examined after 24 hours and 48 hours in the beginning. All the liquid madia which were to show the production of acid and gas did so invariably in 24 hours and there was no advantage in contiuning the incubation for 48 hours. In the case of plates, the maximum number of colonies were obtained in 24 hours and further incubation only resulted in an increase of the size of the colonies and in many instances it permitted the growth of certain slow acid producers which gave misleading results. Accordingly, after making observations at the end of 24 hours, only such of the tubes and plates as gave negative or doubtful results were incubated for further 24 hours and observed. None of them, however, gave any positive reactions at the end of 48 hours. The production of acid and gas (more than 10 per cent in the Durham's tube) in at least two out of the triplicate broth tubes and the appearance on the plates of typical dark-red or brick-red colonies of at least 0.5 m.m. in diameter and not less than five (average of duplicates) in number were taken as positive presumptive evidence of the presence of coliform organisms in any particular dilution. The total number of coliform colonies on the plates was also counted. Completed test for confirmation, of the presumptive evidence. All the positive fermentation tubes as well as selective agar plates in each of the dilutions were subjected to the confirmatory test accord- ing to the procedure recommended by the American Public Health Association [1941]. In the case of positive plates showing more than five colonies any two of the typical colonies were picked up for confirmation. The results of the above tests parried out on 53 samples of milk (induing farm-produced milk, village milk, bulk samples handled in dairies and pasteurised milk) are given in Tables I and II. RESULTS A comparison of the combined results of the presumptive coliform test in different media for all the samples grouped according to the dilutions at which positive reactions were indicated is given in Table I. In order to bring out clearly the comparative efficiency of each medium in giving a clear reaction in 24 hours, in the same material, the number of samples positive or negative in MacConkey's broth at different dilutions have been separately indicated in two series. Taking them as standard, the number of corresponding samples in each group showing an identical reaction in the other media is indicated. Since all the presumptive positive tubes as well as plates were positive to the confirmatory test, no separate column is provided in Table I for illustrating this point. It will be seen (Table I) that practically all the samples, whether showing a positive or negative presumptive test in MacConkey's broth, have given similar reactions in the other two liquid media. The few discrepancies observed may be due to sampling errors. There were no false positives en- countered as the results of the presumptive test in all the media were confirmed without exception: This is in accordance with the observation of Wilson et al [loc. cit.] who did not experience this trouble in the case of MacConkey's broth in a large number of trials with water and milk, while Farrell [loc. cit.] mentions the occurrence of false positives in the case of brilliant green bile broth. As regards the solid media, the number of positives recorded by them is somewhat lower than those indicated by MacConkey's broth in the corresponding dilutions. This anomaly may be due to the limit of five or more colonies taken as positive evidence being too rigorous a condition, because samples giving even one colony on the plate may show development of acid and gas in the liquid medium. In a number of cases giving a positive test in MacConkey's broth the corresponding plates have shown one, two, three or four colonies which have not been taken into account. However,
234 Comparative Study in the Use of Different Media [ XVII no sample showing five or more colonies on the solid media has given a negative test in MacConkey's broth and similarly almost all the samples negative in MacConky's broth have also given a negative test on the solid media.

SUMMARY The use of different liquid media (MacConkey's, formate ricinoleate and brilliant green bile broths) and solid media (MacConkey's, Endo's, Rosin methylene blue and violet red bile agars) for the estimation of coliform organisms in Indian milks has been compared. 2. The results of the presumptive coliform test in liquid media (dilution method) and solid media (plating method) confirmed on Endo's or Rosin methylene blue agars have been examined and the comparative efficiency of each medium brought out. All the three liquid media and MacConkey's and violet red bile agars among solid media have been found to give satisfactory results in 24 hours. REFERENCES American Public Health Association (1941).

ANANTAKRISHNAN, Indian Dairy Research Institute, Bangalore (Received for publication on 17 December 1946) GENERALLY milk can withstand high temperature without undergoing any unwelcome change and this is a very important factor both from the manufacturers' as well as the consumers' points of view. But, it is not very uncommon that sometimes certain samples of milk do not stand even the ordinary boiling. To determine the hygienic .quality as well as to assess the suitability or other- wise of the different lots of milk arriving on a factory platform for various methods of processing different platform tests have been suggested from time to time. The boiling test, acidity determina- tion, alcohol test and phosphate test are the chief among them. The boiling test when positive, indicates that the milk has developed rather high acidity, which removes calcium from combination with the protein, and therefore allows casein to settle. Boiling only accelerates the last phase of this reaction. Acidity determination, as it is usually done, by titration against decinormal sodium hydroxide, does not give a correct picture of the true acidity of a complex fluid like milk according to Rogers et al. [1921]. Even the true acidity of milk as determined by pH value is not a criterion in ascertaining the heat stability of milk according to the same authors. Again, acidity of milk from individual animals, is subject to considerable variation and the value of acidity determination be- comes very questionable. Thus the usefulness of the acidity test is limited to the detection of milk that has developed considerable amount of acidity as a result of bacteriological action caused by unhygienic ways of production. The alcohol test has been commonly used for weeding out milk produced under unhygienic conditions, as well as those that are unstable to heat. According to Sommer and Binny [1923] this test is subject to the influence of various factors, so much so, that its usefulness is very restricted. The findings of Dahlberg and Garner [1921] do not guarantee that this could always be used as a criterion of the heat stability of milk. The effects of acidity and the concentration of salts are additive so far as the alcohol test is concerned, but Rogers and Deyshire [1921] and Sommer and Hart [1926] suggest that the concentration of the mineral salts forms only a minor factor in determining the heat stability of a milk. In fact no test which could predict the heat stability of condensed milk with a reasonable amount of certainty was known till Ramsdell et al. [1931] developed the phosphate test. The above authors have reported a phosphate number ranging from 12 to 37 for single herd milk samples from Freisian and Channel Island breeds and composite milk samples. According to their findings, milk samples with a phosphate number below 20 coagulated within four minutes during sterilization, while samples with a phosphate number above 20 had greater heat stability, but at the same time, they warn that a high pho phate number does not always indicate a highly heat resistant milk sample. Although there is no local or even seasonal surplus of milk in India for the manufacture of con- densed milk, during the last war various isolated attempts were made in certain places to manufac- ture condensed milk out of buffalo milk. Anantakrishnan and Kothavalla (unpublished work) have reported that the alcohol test is more reliable than the phosphate test in predicting the suitability of buffalo milk for condensing and sterilization, but this is just the contrary of the findings of Rams dell et al. [1931]. Probably this difference might be due to certain peculiarities in the phosphate number of buffalo milk as distinct from cow's milk which alone was investigated by the foreign authors. Therefore a study of the seasonal and lactational variations in the phosphate number with special reference to its relation to other platform tests like acidity and alcohol tests was undertaken and the results of the investigation are presented in the following pages. EXPERIMENTAL Six Murrah buffaloes, all in the first month of lactation, were selected from the herd of the Indian Dairy Research Institute. Milk samples were collected in the morning and tested for acidity, alcohol 237 G
238 The Acidity, Alcohol Test and Phosphate in Buffalo milk [ XVII test and phosphate test at 9 a.m. Acidity was determined by the usual titration against standard solution of sodium hydroxide with phenolpthalein as indicator. The alcohol test was carried out as usual by mixing equal amounts of alcohol and milk (2 ml.) but the strength of the alcohol was varied from 60 to 80 per cent by volume till a positive test was obtained. The method of Ramsdell et al. [1931] was adopted for the phosphate number, viz., by adding different amounts of 0.5 M. solution. (68.1 gm. per litre) of potassium dihydrogen phosphate to 2 c.c. lots of milk till coagulation occurred within 0.02 ml. of the reagent on heating the mixture in a boiling water bath for five minutes. Any coagulation was taken as positive and the phosphate number was calculated by multiplying the amount of the reagent expressed in fractional millilitres by 100. The tests were carried out for about one complete lactation to study the seasonal and lactational variations in the various tests if there were any. Also two composite samples, one cow and one buffalo, were tested daily for acidity, alcohol and phosphate tests. Altogether about 1,500 tests were made, each for phosphate number, acidity and alcohol tests. In the case of the phosphate number, it was a very tedious process to arrive at the actual amount of phosphate solution required to produce coagulation as the phosphate- number varied between 8 and 80. Almost a similar difficulty was experienced in the case of the alcohol test, where also there was considerable variation from sample to sample. The weekly average of the phosphate number for the individual buffalo milk samples as well as the two composite milk samples are presented in Table I. The relationship between acidity and phosphate number, acidity and alcohol test and alcohol test and pho phate number are indicated in Tables II, III and IV respectively.

The average acidity of fresh buffalo milk in the first
IV ] P. GAJ RAJ SINGH, et al 239 month of lactation is found to be 0.12 per cent expressed as lactic acid but there is a slight gradual increase in titratable acidity as the lactation advances; this is more pronounced in certain cases while it is not so evident in other cases. Probably this increase in titratable acidity is not due to true acidity but due to other factors like casein and phosphates which also combine with alkali as suggested by Rogers et al. [1921].

Although no consistent relationship between titratable acidity and phosphate number has been reported by the foreign workers, it is quite clear that the phosphate number comes down as the acidity increases. At an acidity of 0.10 per cent lactic acid in milk, only below one per cent of the readings for phosphate number fall below 20. As the acidity increases the percentage of phos- phate numbers below 20 increases rather rapidly so that at an acidity of 0.13 per cent, 27 per cent of the readings fall below 20, and 56 per cent at an acidity of 0.19 per cent. Therefore, it is quite clear that there is some relationship between acidity and phosphate number, and this too is found to be statistically significant.

GAJ RAJ SINGH, et al 241 number below 20 is as low as 5, and beyond 62 per cent alcohol this percentage is negligible. In the alcohol test it is a common observation that as the quality of milk deteriorates the sample gives a p itive alcohol test with lower and lower concentration of alcohol. Similarly Ramsdell et al. [1931] have reported that samples with phosphate number below 20 are less stable to heat. In view of the findings of the present investigation these two tests could be put together to assess the quality of the milk sample under investigation. Table I shows the individual and other variations in the phosphate number so far as buffalo milk is concerned. For fresh individual samples of milk, figures as low as 10 and as high as 82 have been met with, but such figures are very few, so that the mean is always far from both of these. In most of the individual samples, it is found, that there is a gradual increase in the phosphate number as the lactation advances, although this increase is not maintained towards the end of the lactation. Almost the same tendency is observed in the case of the composite cow and buffalo samples. There is considerable daily variation in the phosphate number of the individual milk samples although this is not so very marked in the case of the composite sample. The weekly average of the phosphate numbers has never been below 20, although it has touched 20 at times. This shows that there are at least a few samples which fall below 20. Ramsdell et al. [1931] have reported that cow milk samples with phosphate numbers below 20 have a low heat stability. From Table I it is seen that buffalo composite milk has got a higher phosphate number when compared to cow composite milk. Pro- bably this may be due to the difference in salt distribution balance. SUMMARY 1. The various commonly used platform tests like the acidity, alcohol and phosphate tests have been studied from the beginning of one lactation for nearly six months in the case of individual buffalo milk samples. 2. The inter-relationship between the various tests has been investigated and discussed. 3. There is considerable variation in the acidity of the samples from individual to individual and from day to day. 4. The alcohol test requires modification by way of reducing the concentration of the alcohol, to be used for buffalo milk. A concentration of 60 per cent alcohol by volume is recommended for buffalo milk. 5. There is found to be wide variation in the phosphate number of individual buffalo milk samples. 6. An increasing number of samples with high titratable acidity have a phosphate number below 20. 7. A good proportion of the samples giving a positive alcohol test with 60 per cent alcohol were found to have a phosphate number 20 or below. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Our thanks are due to Dr N. N.

AN OUTBREAK OF GOAT-POX IN HISSAR DISTRICT (PUNJAB) By H. K. LALL, B. Sc., M. R. C. V. S., GOPAL SINGH L.V.P, and JAGAT SINGH, L.V.P., Government Livestock Farm, Hissar (Received for publication on 21 May 1947) OUTBREAKS of goat-pox have been reported from time to time from various provinces and States of India, but as compared to sheep-pox its occurrence has been less conspicuous. Three cases of goat-pox were recorded in 1929-30 at the Government Livestock Farm, Hissar, but there isno reliable evidence of its recurrence until 1944-45 when the disease spread to farm goats from the experimental goats. The present work arose out of an outbreak of this disease in Hissar district. In January, 1945, the disease was reported from Dabwali but no material was available for investigation. A month later, report of a fresh outbreak was received from Ratia, Sarsa and Fatehabad villages to the east of Dabwali. The disease has been observed in the other parts of Punjab in winter or early spring ; sheep-pox has a similar seasonal trend. Such a trend has not been mentioned in the various Disease Investigation Officers' reports. Chadha [1942-43] has, however, stated in connection with an outbreak in Bombay in 1942-43 that the disease prevailed throughout the year. The goats affected in the outbreak in Ratia were of the ordinary desi type. The various flock owners reported the mortality as 19 per cent in goats and 11.4 per cent in sheep, but whether all this illness was due to goat-pox cannot be definitely said. Most of the animals examined by us were recovering and showed pox nodules in the form of haemorrhagic scabs over the back and flanks. Two examined post-mortem showed no internal lesions except for a single lung nodule in one of them. One female kid had pox lesions all over the body including the udder, the size of discrete nodules varying from that of a 4 anna to Sanna bit. To study the disease in detail, a kid having pox nodules was brought to Hissar. EXPERIMENTS AT HISSAR Transmission work Preliminary experiments were carried out in one of the farm blocks, about 1½ miles from the main dairy flock. The disease was transmitted to two six-month old kids (Nos. 1 and 2), using a suspension of scab material from the diseased kid. This suspension was scarified on the abdomen and a drop of it was also injected intracutaneously. Two other kids, three months old (Nos. 3 and 4), one of which was of hill breed, were then infected from material taken from kids 1 and 2. To main- tain the virus for further study, yet another kid was infected with virus from Nos. 3 and 4, but it failed to react and we presumed that the virus was lost. On previous occasions also some difficulty has been experienced in establishing the disease under experimental conditions. A similar experi- ence has been expressed by Henderson [1938]. None of the inoculated kids developed the disease in generalized form. Iyer [1939] has reported successful experimental reproduction of goat pox in a generalized form by inoculating sub-cutaneous- ly blood taken at the height of fever or by means of spleen suspension. However, these methods were not tried by us. Following the cutaneous inoculations in our experimental kids, only a local reaction was observed. Four or five days after the inoculation, there was a slight reddening of the scarified area, corresponding with a rise of body temperature. After eleven days, Kid No. 1 showed sharply defined vesicles. The vesicles were flattened and firm to the touch, and had little fluid in them. In kid No. 2 there was a rather firm prominent swelling over the scarified area, up to the size of the palm of the hand. Within the next few days the lesions in these two animals became very hard and nodular and were covered with haemorrahagic scabs. The vesicular stage was very transient. The temperature rose by nearly 2°244 An Outbreak of Goat-Pox in Hissar District [XVII Spread of the disease Some adult goats, which were being kept for another experiment in the same enclosure as the pox-infected kids, were transferred to the main goat dairy one month after the last transmission experiment. These goats did not catch the infection during five to six weeks they were in contact with the artificially infected kids, and it was therefore presumed they were healthy. However, six weeks after the adult goats were transferred, cases of goat-pox were detected among them and also among the dairy goats. After the disease had subsided in the female stock, it spread to the males which were being kept away from the dairy goats, to avoid infection. These observations seem to suggest that the incubation period in goat-pox may be fairly long. According to Melanidi and Tzort- zaki [1936], the incubation period in goat-pox is two to three days, followed by a stage of skin eruption lasting for two to three weeks. Mortality and lesions From the reports of Disease Investigation Officers [1936-1945], it is found that in Bombay, in 1938-39, there was 9 per cent mortality in one outbreak and 73 per cent in another ; two outbreaks recorded in the United Provinces in 1938-39 and 1942-43 showed a mortality-rate varying from 15 to 20 per cent. Vishwanathan [1938-39] reported a 30 per cent mortality-rate in an outbreak diagnosed in 1938-39. Kuppaswamy [1936] reports a mortality rate of 54 per cent attributing the high percentage to unfavourable climatic conditions. lack of hygiene and unsuitable food. According to Donation and Lestoquard [1936] discrepancies in the results of different workers on sheep-pox are due to differences in the susceptibility of individual sheep and state of the virus, which has three distinct phases of virulence from extreme to low. This is probably true in the case of goat-pox as well. Altogether, in the original outbreak, 11 out of 179 female goats (39.7 per cent), 3 out of 13 male goats, 25 out of 100 kids (25 per cent), and 15 out of 30 (50 per cent) castrated kids, males, suffered from the disease. The incidence was less in females and kids than in males and adults. The outbreak lasted for about two months. There were only two deaths, viz. goat No. 59, which developed gangreaous pneumonia as a complication, and an Angora buck which showed pox lesions in the lung. Mortality was, therefore, low in this outbreak as compared with that reported by the Disease Investigation Officers [1936-45] possibly due to low virulence of the virus. In most cases pox nodules were generalized over the body, the teats and scrotum being parti- cularly affected. There was rise of temperature lasting for 10 days or more, and considerable decline in the milk yield during the active phase of the outbreak. A typical acute case was that of goat No. 929. Vesicles were present all over the body, nostils, lips, udder and teats. Pneumonia developed with rise of temperature to 107°F. This goat, however. recovered after a laborious treat- ment. In some cases there was suspension of rumination, and rapid respiration. A tendency to sit in the sun was observed in many cases. On the seventh day vesicles became black and by the ninth day scabs had formed. SUSCEPTIBILITY OF OTHER ANIMALS According to the flock owners, sheep also died during the outbreak, but no affected sheep were seen at the time of the visit. From the reports of the various Disease Investigation Officers [1936-45] it seems that in outbreaks of goat-pox only goats were affected, though it is not clearly stated in all cases that these were the only animals affected. According to Melanidi et al. [1936], cattle, horses, rabbits and poultry are also susceptible to the virus of goat-pox while man is insusceptible, but it is only in goats that the disease takes an epizootic form. Slagsvold [1938], on the other hand, states that disease is readily transmissible among goats and sheep, and attempts to infect cattle, pigs, horses, rabbits, guinea-pigs and poultry failed. Bennett, Horgan and Haseeb [1944] obtained a typical pox syndrome in sheep, cows, and rabbits with goat-pox virus, though they found no immunological relationship between the viruses of vaccinia, sheep-pox and goat-pox. A close relationship, however, was observed between the viruses of goat-pox and contagious pustular dermatitis of goats. Hutyra and Marek [1926] have also stated that in some cases transmission of goat-pox to sheep is successful but that only an incomplete pox exanthema is produced at the point of inoculation.
IV] H. K.LALL, GOPAL SINGH AND JAGAT SINGH 245 In the first instance we tried without success to infect two lambs, a buffalo calf and a cow calf. Some Hissari and Bikaneri sheep were also constantly kept in close contact with infected animals but the disease did not appear among them. In another attempt two Bikaneri, two Hissari (Merino- Bikaneri crosses) lambs were infected; in one animal of each bread the virus was scarified and in the other it was given intracutaneously. The two scarified lambs developed vesicles over the scarified area but nothing happened in the other two. The experiment was repeated with two more lambs using udder scabs from a severe case, goat No. 59. One of the two lambs, No. 248 was scarified as well as inoculated intracutaneously at the caudal fold, while in the other, No. 272, the material was given intracutaneously only. No. .248 developed a local reaction and pox lesions on the sixth day on the scarified area only, while the other developed vesicles on the abdomen at about the same time. These experiments indicate that it is possible to produce a localized lesion in sheep with goat-pox virus, but that sheep do not get a generalized form of the disease either by artificial infection or by exposure to naturally diseased animals. A group of cross-bred hill goats, maintained at the farm (Kangra hill Angora) contracted the disease naturally and, of course, it was also possible to transmit the disease to them artificially. Out of the two cross-bred kids used for experiment, one was scarified on the abdomen and the other was injected intracutaneously at the caudal fold. The kid which was scarified developed local vesicles on the third day and a generalized form of the disease on the eighth day, while the other failed to develop the disease except for a local reaction in the form of a hard nodule. VACCINATION When the first case was brought to our notice, it was deemed necessary to immunize the rest of the flock, for which purpose serum-sensitized and glycerinated virus vaccines were tried. The virus was obtained from field cases. This method along with ' ovination' has been tried by Chadha [1942-1943] with inconclusive results. Immunization by ovination was also tried on 510 goats by Vishwanathan [1938-1939] who observed severe local or generalized reaction in most of them. Glycerinated virus Fifteen female goats 12 to 15 months old and ten kids two to three months old were inoculated intracutaneously at the caudal fold on the 19th April, 1945, with two drops of glycerinated virus (virus material mixed with an equal volume of glycerine) which had been left for 24 hours at serum pit temperature (about 55-65°F.). The vaccinated animals, with one exception, developed a typical local reaction in the form of a flat, sharply circumscribed vesicle of the size of an eight anna bit. The reaction started as a reddening on the third day, developing into a raised flat vesicle two or three days later. In three cases, where an excess of virus was injected by accident, the local reaction was severe, resulting in necrosis and ulceration of the skin. Five female goats also developed a few lesions on the body, but these animals were possibly in the incubation stage at the time of vaccination. Mild thermal reaction lasting for three to four days was seen in some cases on the sixth day. Serum-sensitized virus Scabs from fresh cases were soaked in serum from a recovered animal, who had shown an acute infection and the suspension kept in the serum pit for 24 to 48 hours. Ten kids were injected intra- cutaneously into the caudal fold with suspension which had been held for 24 hours, and this produced a local reaction in all except one. Three of the kids developed a mild degree of pox with two to three vesicles only. In a second group of five goats, which were given a 48-hour old suspension, there was a local reaction only. These reactions were similar to, though slightly milder than the ones produced by glycerinated virus, and consisted of a rise of temperature on the fourth to the sixth day. A week after the reaction had subsided, all the vaccinated animals along with five controls, were kept in close contact with infected goats for three weeks, but unfortunately neither controls nor vaccinated showed any symptoms. These experiments were thus inconclusive, except for the fact that neither glycerinated nor serum-sensitized virus produced severe reactions when used as a vaccine.
246 An outbreak of Goat-Pox in Hissar District [XVII Chadda [1942-1943] however, obtained unexpectedly severe-reactions in one of his experiments and believed this to be due to the serum not being sufficiently protective. Immunity test Ten female goats, obtained from a goat-pox-free area, were successfully vaccinated with glyceri- nated virus on the 22nd June 1945. These were kept for the purpose of immunity testing. Un- fortunately, at this time, no goats could be vaccinated with serum-sensitized virus due to lack of facilities. Nearly six months later, eight of these goats, together with four kids four months old and born after the outbreak subsided, acting a controls, were scarified on the abdomen with a saline suspension of goat-pox virus obtained from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteswar. Marked local and thermal reaction (rise of 2°F.) was noticed on the fifth day in the vaccinated as well as in control animals. On the tenth day the temperature returned to normal, and the local reactions subsided after 20 days. The results were thus again inconclusive. Apparently, the Mukte- swar virus was not very virulent, as none of the animals was severely affected. The present experi- ments, as well as those of other workers in India, indicate the need for further work on the virulence and potency of goat-pox virus in India, its relation to that of sheep-pox and the methods of com- bating the disease in the field. SUMMARY An outbreak of goat-pox is described in the dairy flock of goats at the Government Livestock Farm. The disease spread from animals experimentally infected with virus obtained from an out- break in Hissar district. Mortality was low, but there was considerable reduction in milk yield as the result of the disease. Attempts to produce the disease in a calf and a buffalo calf were unsuccess- ful. It was, however, possible to produce local lesions in lambs with the goat-pox virus. Groups of goats vaccinated with serum-sensitized or with glycerinated virus, along with non-vaccinated controls were exposed to natural infection immediately after vaccination, but neither the controls nor the vaccinated ones developed the disease. An immunity test, carried out on another group of goats six months after vaccination, with glycerinated virus, was also inconclusive, because both vaccinated and control goats reacted with goat-pox virus obtained from the Indian Veterinary Re- search Institute, Mukteswar.

SOME OBSERVATIONS OF PASTEURELLOSIS I.248 An Outbreak of Pasteurellosis in Geese [XVII A few drops of heart blood from the rabbit were diluted with about 5 c.c. of sterile broth and inoculated subcutaneously into another rabbit and intravenously into a fowl. Again, both died the following night and pasteurella was demonstrated in large numbers in films and in cultures from their heart blood. Similarly, from the guinea-pig, heart blood was subinoculated intravenously into a fowl and subcutaneously into another guinea-pig. The second guinea-pig looked sickly for some days, but survived. The fowl died about 40 hours after inoculation and showed typical pasteurella in peri- pheral blood, heart blood, liver and spleen films. Clinical features. These were not observed systematically. The symptoms noted were : mark- ed dullness, loss of appetite, increased thirst, some discharge from the beak, diarrhoea, and in a few cases weak limbs probably due to involvement of joints. Post-mortem findings. According to the post-mortem picture most cases would fall in the class of sub-acute infection. Thus, besides usual haemorrhages and varying degrees of enteritis, the liver was found studded with numerous minute discrete grayish-yellow ' necrotic' foci. A few livers examined earlier in the outbreak appeared clean, except being slightly enlarged, while in a few case, examined later in the outbreak, larger ' necrotic ' areas were noted. The spleen was never found distinctly enlarged. CONTROL MEASURES The obvious preliminary step was to relieve overcrowding. This could not be accomplished for want of space. Such other sanitary measures, like disinfection of premises, etc. were adopted as the prevailing conditions permitted. Inoculation with fowl cholera vaccine and serum as prepared by the Indian Veterinary Re- search Institute was undertaken. Since the owners could not be persuaded to withhold sale beyond a few days, the results of these measures could not be correctly assessed. Deaths continued to occur during the first week after inoculation, but later the disease seemed to have been brought under control.

II.-PASTEURELLOSIS IN DUCKLINGS By, S. NURUL MOHTEDA, G.M.V.C., Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry), Hyderabad Dn. (Received for publication on 14 October 1946) FOWL CHOLERA, as it affects ducklings three to four months old, was studied for the first time in Hyderabad State in 1943. A general survey of poultry disease in the State revealed the existence of sickness affecting ducks which caused sudden death and which was suspected to be either cholera or paratyphoid infection. The disease usually subsided of its own accord. In the present investigation the death of 12 ducks was reported within four days of their purchase. No relevant information concerning the source of the disease was available. One ailing and one dead bird were brought to the laboratory for examination. Lesions. No diagnostic symptom of pasteurella infection was apparent. Pinpoint haemorr- hages were found in the heart coronary fat; the lungs were congested and partly pneumonic ; the liver contained petechial haemorrhages, as well as white necrotic foci, while the intestines were affected with catarrhal haemorrhagic enteritis. All other organs were normal. Diagnosis. Films of heart-blood and liver contained bipolar organisms simulating Pasteurella aviseptica. To confirm the diagnosis a pigeon was infected intraperitoneally with 2 c.c. of the suspen- sion of the liver, spleen and heart-blood, while a fowl was infected intravenously with the same amount of suspension of bone marrow. Both died after 18-20 hours and smears of this blood contained organisms indistinguishable from those of P. aviseptica. Again, another fowl was infected intraven- ously with the same results. A rabbit inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 c.c. of heart-blood died within five hours of the injection after struggling for 5-10 minutes and passing semi-solid faeces. In this case also blood smears were positive for P. aviseptica. The material from the original case as well as from the experimental birds were sent to Izatnagar for bacteriological study. The material included demuscled femur and tibia bones preserved in powdered charcoal, a portion of the liver, a heart-blood swab, and heart-blood in a pipette. Pasteurella infection was confirmed. The organism isolated was pathogenic to fowl, duck, pigeon and rabbit, but cross agglutination tests with various types of sera proved it to be different from the usual fowl strain. SUMMARY An outbreak of fowl cholera or pasteurellosis among ducklings in an endemic form has been recorded in Hyderabad State. The duck strain (Past, aviseptica) on serological examination revealed significant differences in its antigenic composition from that of the chicken strain. 249 B
III.-AN OUTBREAK OF PASTEURELLOSIS IN DUCKS By S. K. BHADURY, B.Sc., Assistant Disease Investigation Officer (Poultry), Bengal (Received for publication on 20 January 1947) THE disease, though not uncommon, seems to have been little described so far as concerns symp toms, post-mortem features and other correlated aspects of diagnosis and control. The present article deals with a subacute type of outbreak in Bengal. Pasteurellosis was first suspected from microscopical examination of films prepared from the heart blood of affected birds, and diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by biological test. A significant point was that the causal organisms could be demonstrated only in birds in which the course of the disease was prolonged. The charac- teristic liver lesions, viz. greyish necrotic foci, were a regular feature in the protracted cases, and were absent in the less acute cases, in which also films from heart blood were apparently free from organisms. History. About the middle of March, 1946, a firm of contractors in Calcutta sent to my laboratory two living and one dead duck from their farm. This farm was started about six months previously and to its stock frequent additions were made from time to time from local markets. Prior to the investigation the total number of ducks on the farm was 300. For the previous two months sporadic deaths of one or two ducks were reported, and were ascribed to the overwhelming number of males to females. Little was done to combat these losses, and no serious attention was paid to these isolated reports. This state of affairs continued until suddenly the mortality figure rose to fifteen dead in a single day. The owners, then suspected some contagious disease and segre- gated the affected birds, but heavy losses continued during the next few days till the matter was referred to me. Investigation. The duck farm was spacious and was sheltered by tall shady trees. Adjoining was a wide, deep, semicircular pond. Some of the ducks were found to be swimming in the tank, others were resting or moving about with a certain amount of freedom, in a manner that did not seem to prohibit fully indiscriminate mixing. At the date of my visit, the number of ducks on the farm had diminished from 300 to 150, and about 25 sick birds had been segregated, of which four were already dead. The course of the disease was generally rapid, varying from 16-20 hours, though some took a protracted course and lingered up to three days. The disease appeared to have become widespread and losses at this stage were recorded at the rate of about 30 a day. Six birds (three sick and three recently dead) were brought to the laboratory for further study. Symptoms. Clinical symptoms were few but were similar and more or less well pronounced in almost every case. There was lameness of both legs, foul-smelling greenish-yellow diarrhoea, and discharge from the eyes, which at times was copious and purulent. In some cases, the eyelids of both eyes were glued together by an adhesive discharge, but on retracting the lids, the eyes seemed to be normal. As the disease progressed the birds lost strength in their legs and rested on their hocks, with head sunken in and turned towards the body. There was respiratory difficulty, marked by a long inspiration and short rapid expirations. Finally, the neck and limbs were stretched and the bird collapsed, the body sometimes turning turtle. There was inappetance and general lethargy throughout, but the leg-weakness was usually the first sign marking the beginning of the malady. Post-mortem. The carcases were generally in fair condition but heavily infested with lice. On opening the body, the first noticeable feature was an unusual stickiness of the viscera, which were enmeshed in a gelatinous, brownish-yellow exudate. This exudate was so gummy, that it hamper- ed the post-mortem operation. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys showed signs of acute congestion. The intestines were filled with dark-coloured semi-fluid ingesta, and the mucous mem- brane showed haemorrhagic patches throughout. In two cases the liver was pale and anaemic. Caecal scrapings of two ducks showed fairly frequent trichomonads; from the coecum of another case about two dozen trematodes (N. attenuatus) were recovered. 251 M
252 An Outbreak of Pasteurellosis in ducks [XVI Diagnosis. From the course and the nature of mortality, the contagious nature of the disease was apparent from the beginning. Films of heart blood, liver and spleen from three dead birds at the height of the disease and from two other that had died an hour earlier showed no bacteria. The presence of a large number of living trichomonads from the coecal scrapings of two recently dead birds suggested that these organisms were the cause, but this was not confirmed as no trichomonads were noticed in other cases. The liver in two other birds which died a little later were enlarged and congested, and showed numerous, minute, discrete, whitish, ' necrotic ' foci from pin point to pin head size and sometimes of an irregular shape. The heart fat in the coronary groves showed petechial haemorrhages. Films of heart blood and liver of one of these showed a few Pasteurella-like organisms, but from the other bird smears of heart-blood and liver showed in enormous numbers bipolar organism typical of Pasteurella septica. Pathogenicity. About 0.25 c.c. of blood was aspirated into a sterile syringe directly from the heart of the two latterly autopsied ducks and injected subcutaneously into two fowls. Both the fowls died within 23 hours ; from them, blood films stained by Leishman method showed large numbers of typical Past. septica. Liver smears also showed fairly frequent typical Past. septica. Control. At the time control measures were introduced, only 90 birds were available. These were divided into three groups to be treated with serum, with vaccine and a control group. Un- fortunately, the owners insisted that the control should also be treated, so these were given both serum and vaccine. For these purposes, bovine pasteurella serum and vaccine were used, sub- cutaneously at the rate of 10 c.c. serum and 1 c.c. vaccine for each bird. Results. The result of vaccination is shown in Table I. It was hoped to keep the vaccinated birds quite separate for careful study, but owing to lack of proper supervision on the part of the owners this plan did not entirely succeed. Post-mortem examination was continued time to time in birds dying after vaccination. Past. septica was seen in blood films of the dead birds, in small or large numbers.

Nevertheless, control was not successful since more birds died during the immediate post-inoculation period. Most of deaths occurred in the vaccine group, next in the serum group, while the sero- vaccine group showed the lowest mortality. The difference however between the serum group and the sero-vaccine group was negligible. SUMMARY An outbreak mainly, subacute in type, of pasteurellosis in ducks is described. The disease seemed to have been introduced into the flock by infected ducks. Diagnosis was by microscopical examination of heart-blood but the organisms could only be selected in the blood of birds in which the disease was subacute in type. Control measures adopted late in the outbreak had little success
NUTRITIVE VALUES OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF NAPIER GRASS By INDUBHUSAN CHATTERJEE, M.Sc. (AGR.), L.AG., MD. ABDUL HYE, M.SC. and MD. SAYED ALI, Animal Nutrition Section, Dacca Farm (Received for publication on 29 May 1947) (With two text-figures) NAPIER GRASS (Pennisetum purpureum) is a fodder which has been recommended for use by the Bengal Agricultural Department. The chief point in its favour is that it is a prolific grower. In the earlier feeding trials conducted during 1932, it was found to contain about 10 to 16 per cent of dry matter and 90 to 84 per cent of water. Seasonal estimation conducted both in 1932 and later on in 1935-36 with plants of different heights from 1 ft. to 6 ft. has shown a variation which is best illustrated (mean basis) in Table I.

There is however a very large difference between the values of 1932 and of 1935-36. This is partly due to the fact that the 1935-36 crop was ratoon continuing from 1932 and partly that the growth was slower in the later year, due to some extent to a drier condition. The larger percentage of dry matter in the ratoon crop raises the question as to how far such increase contributes towards a corresponding increase and efficiency of the nutrients. This may be partially judged from the percentage of nitrogen as set forth in Table II.

254 Nutritive Values of Different Parts of Napier Grass [XVII Even a cursory glance of Tables I and II will show that as the percentage of dry matter has increased, there has been a progressive fall of the percentage of nitrogen. In other words they seem to vary in an inverse ratio. How far such a variation throws its reflex on the actual yield of both nitrogen and dry matter per unit area is also a matter of great importance. This is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.

IV] I. B. CHATTERJEE, MD. ABDUL HYE AND MD. SAYED ALI 255 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Fig. 2. The Yields of dry matter and nitrogen and the percentage of nitrogen on dry basis of Napier grass of different heights in 1935-1936. In these graphs (Figs. 1 and 2) the yield of dry matter, the yield of nitrogen and the percentage of nitrogen on dry basis have been plotted against 1 ft., 2 ft., 3 ft., 4 ft., 5 ft., and 6 ft crops for 1932 and 1935-36. Though there has been a large difference between the actual yield for two years, there is broadly much agreement between the bearing of the nitrogen to the dry matter. For instance, if we take the case of the whole plant the yield of nitrogen has been highest at 1 ft. crop, at 2 ft. crop there is a fall which continues up to 3 ft. from which stage it is virtually constant. The dry matter however progressively increases though there is a slight variation for 4 ft. and 6 ft. crop in 1932. There are two points of interest. From the nutritive standpoint, which stage viz. of 3 ft., 4 ft. or upwards provides the best combination of digestible dry matter and digestible protein ? From the standpoint of plant physiology it opens out an interesting query as to what becomes of the fate of the extra nitrogen which the 1 ft. plant first imbibes but which is apparently lost as the plant grows in height. From the economic side it is necessary to trap this nitrogen and harness it for increasing a valuable source of nutritive components. This is however a work for the plant physiologist. N2
256 Nutritive Values of Different Parts of Napier Grass [XVII If the distribution of nitrogen and dry matter between leaves and stems is examined, by far the largest amount of nitrogen, whether in terms of total yield or percentage, falls to the share of leaves. The converse is the case with the dry matter. In this the stem accounts for the largest share with the lowest percentage and total yield of nitrogen. Another interesting feature is that up to the 5 ft stage the yield of dry matter of the leaves does not seem to exhibit significant variation. The drop at 6 ft. is largely because of slower growth during the dry season. The results suggest that the outturn of leaves (dry weight) does not undergo precipitous variation. There is no doubt some fall in the outturn of nitrogen (in leaves) per unit area. The main variation is with the stem which increases its dry matter as it increases in height but at the same time it translocates its nitrogen to the leaves and shows a decreasing amount in the percentage or yield. Since the criterion of digestibility and assimilability is closely connected with the coarseness and quantity of dry matter specially from the stem, it would seem that growth above 3 ft. (or at the most 4 ft.) is likely to react adversely against economic utilization. Only a limited amount of analysis of the organic components of the composite samples of 1932 crop was conducted and the results are setforth in Table III.

The main feature here is a higher percentage of protein in the 1 ft. stage which can be detected in Figs. 1 and 2 also. From the 2 ft. stage the protein content in the leaves remains about the same but in its stem it has gone down. As can be expected the ether extract percentage is more in the leaves than in the stems. With respect to fibre the lowest percentage (21.78 per cent) has been recorded for leaves at the 1 ft. stage, and to some extent upto the 2 ft. stage, but above heights they are about the same. As a matter of fact from the 3 ft. stage the percentage of crude fibre whether in leaves or stems is about the same. At the same time the fibre fraction of the leaves is likely to be better digested than that of the stem. The main feature of the ash content is that the stem has more soluble matter and corresponding- ly less acid insoluble residue than the leaves. This aspect will be taken up again later. VARIATION IN THE NUTRITVE MAKE-UP OF THE SOFTER AND THE COARSER PARTS It will be noted from a general survey of the preceding that possibly somewhere about the 3 to 4 ft. stage the combinations of components are such as to provide an economic utilization. An experiment conducted in 1941 suggests this in a more impressive manner. The indications were obtained in the following way. During the course of feeding amon straw and Napier grass it was noticed that the animals often left an appreciable fraction of the harder part of the stem. It was
IV] I. B. CHATTERJEE, MD. ABDUL HYE AND MD. SAYED ALI 257 therefore considered advisable to see how the composition of this part varied with the rest. A some- what arbitrary procedure was adopted. The Napier grass was fed chaffed but as soon as the grass was brought for chaffing not less than twenty plants were picked at random, the length of each plant was measured and then all the plants weighed. A sort of eye and hand test was used by which, depending on the nature of individual plant, the bottom part of the stem (i.e. the coarser part) was chopped off. The lengths of the two portions, viz. the bottom part as well as the remaining part of the stem, were measured out and both the pieces were immediately wieghed. The leaves were also separated, measured and weighed. Proportionate parts after calculation were weighed out first for the dry matter estimation and then to serve as composite samples for chemical analysis. Daily estimations of nitrogen and dry matter of the different fractions were carried out. In Tables IV, V and VI the dimensions of different parts, dry matter and nitrogen are set up.* * In the feeding trial the coarser part of the stock was removed before the grass was choffed. The animals ate better and left less.

In other words the top 3¼ ft. of the stem was the softer and possibly the more edible and assimilable part. If now the percentages and distributions of dry matter and nitrogen are examined, it is noted that the leaves contain the largest percentage of dry matter (20 per cent to 26 per cent), the coarser

SAYED ALI 259 stem is intermediate (16 per cent to 23 per cent), and the softer stem the lowest at 12 per cent to 19 per cent, whereas on the basis of the whole plant the dry matter varies from 15 per cent to 23 per cent (Table IV). If the proportionate distribution of green and dry matters are examined (Table VI), it will be noted that the leaves and softer stems together account for about 80 per cent leaving 20 per cent to the rejected or coarser part of the stem. This is further corroborated by the mean given in Table VII. If now the nitrogen is examined on a similar basis (Tables V and VI), the highest percentage of nitrogen on a dry basis is in the leaves (1 to 2 per cent), the softer stem is intermediate at 0.4 per cent to 1 per cent and the coarser stem lowest at 0.2 per cent to 0.4 per cent. The differences are still strikingly demonstrated on the basis of their proportionate distribution. Here it will be noted (Table VI) that if the nitrogen present in the whole plant is taken at 100, not more than 5 to 8 parts (with the exception of the three in which it has been between 8.6 to 10.6) are in the coarser stem. In other words over 90 per cent are certainly available in the leaves and softer stem, possibly in a more palatable and assimilable form for the nourishment of the animal. The largest proportion is in the leaves (53 to 69 parts), while the softer stem accounts for 24 to 40 parts. It is interesting at this stage to compare how the other organic and mineral nutrients vary. As they could not be estimated separately for each day's sample, a composite sample was made on a proportionate basis from the collection of 15 days from 15th July 1941 to 29th July 1941.

260 Nutritive Values of Different Parts of Napier Grass [XVII It is noted here that the coarser stem has the largest percentage of organic matter (96.7 per cent), chiefly fibre (38.6 per cent) and nitrogen.free extract (56 per cent); as a matter of fact these constitute such a large part of the organic make-up that very little is left for the other nutritive components specially protein (1.61 per cent) or fat (0.47 per cent); much of the nitrogen-free extract is however embedded in the hard integument which prevent its full assimilation. The coarser stem is also very poor in lime (0.12 per cent), a characteristic of the whole plant (0.29 per cent CaO). The leaves contain the largest percentage of protein (8.01 per cent) and lime (0.51 per cent), while the softer stem stands second in protein content but first in soluble ash (4.82 per cent), potash (2.33 per cent) magnesia (0.46 per cent), phosphorous (0.86 per cent) and chloride (0.31 per cent). Taken on the whole the more useful components exist in larger percentages in the leaves and softer stem. This aspect is more clearly demonstrated on the basis of proportionate distribution of nutrients shown in the last three columns of Table VII. It will be noted that per 100 parts of whole plants (leaves, softer stem and coarser stem) about 79 parts of organic matter are distributed between the leaves (33.3 parts) and the softer stem (46.0 parts) leaving nearly 21 parts for the coarser stem. Protein and ether extract run parallel, being divided between 6 to 7 parts in the coarser stem, 31 to 33 parts in the softer stem and 60 to 63 parts in the leaves. Though the actual fibre content is highest in the coarser stem, it only forms 22.3 parts for 100 in the whole plant. This is due to the fact that the entire coarser stem does not constitute more than one-fifth of the whole plant. Of the soluble ash 90 parts are divided between the leaves (35.3 parts) and the stem (54.5 parts) leaving 10.2 parts for the coarser stem. The leaves also contain most of insoluble ash (57 parts) as compared to 34.2 parts in the softer stem and 8.8 parts in the coarser stem. Of individual minerals the leaves have 60.1 parts of lime, the softer stem 31.6 parts and the coarser stem 8.3 parts. The softer stem have the largest share of magnesia, potash, phosphate and chlorine, viz. 55.0, 58.6, 56.4 and 63.2 respectively. Contrary to expectation phosphate has been found highest (both in composition and distribution) in the softer stem and less in the leaves. Taking all facts into consideration the coarser stem, if rejected, will account for a loss of 20 parts organic matter, about 8 to 9 parts of lime, 14 parts of phosphate, 26 parts of soda and 7 parts of potash. The animal is generally inclined to reject much of this part. The object of this work was to ascertain whether in feeding Napier grass it would be more economical to put the whole plant to the feeding trough or to discard the coarser part. The results suggest that the coarser part is poor in composition with respect to all components except fibre and nitrogen-free extract. But on account of its coarse and tough integuments it is bound to involve an expenditure of a large amount of energy in the work of digestion. It is likely that its exclusion from the diet might prove more economical than its inclusion because of the saving of energy and because the diet would be more efficiently digested the loss of essential minerals would be negligible. SUMMARY 1. The composition of the coarse stem, the rest of the stem, and the leaves of Napier grass, a 1 ft., 2 ft., 3 ft., 4 ft., 5 ft. and 6 ft. high grown in Bengal was assayed and is discussed. 2. It is suggested that the coarse part of the stem is not worth feeding.
SOME DIGESTIBILITY TRIALS ON INDIAN FEEDING STUFFS XIII. DESI SUGARCANE SACCHRUM BARBARI JBSW (KATHA) By LAL CHAND DHARMANI, AGRICULTURAL CHEMIST II, KARTAR SINGH LOHARA, B.SC., (AGRI.) and N. AKBAR ALI, B.Sc. (AGRI.) (Received for publication 26 Oct. 1945) THICK Coimbatore varieties of sugarcane introduced by the Department of Agriculture in the Punjab, yield higher tonnage of cane and bring more profit to the growers than desi sugarcane. Inspite of this the zamindars in the Punjab still grow desi varieties of sugarcane on a fairly large scale and Katha is one of the most favourite canes. The main reason of its finding favour with the zamindars is that during the days of fodder scarcity this cane can be fed to cattle, being thinner than all the Coimbatore varieties. It has a great tillering capacity and can stand drought, flooding and frost. Its thickness (average diameter) is 1.44 c.m. Stripped cane forms 66 per cent of the whole. Digestibility trials were conducted with Katha sugarcane on five Sahiwal heifers with a view to find out the feeding value of this cane as compared to wheat bhusa, the staple fodder of cattle in the Punjab. Five Sahiwal heifers Nos. 171, 200, 212, 199 and J. D., two to three years old, were used as. experimental animals for the digestibility trials. The technique followed was the same as is usually employed in such trials at the Lyallpur Animal Nutrition Centre [ Memoirs of the Department of Agriculture in India, 1928, IX (7) ]. The experimental animals were kept on the usual preparatory period of 15 days. During the experimental period all the animals were given weighed amount of the feed and their voidings were carefully collected and sampled for detailed analysis in the labora- tory. The entire sugarcane including tops and dry leaves was cut into half inch pieces with a chaff cutter before feeding to the animals. Three digestibility trials were carried out with this feed during the months of December and January. RESULTS The chemical composition of the feed employed during the three trials is given in Table I. The chemical composition of wheat bhusa is also given for sake of comparison in the same Table. The digestibility data and the nutrients digested from 100 lb. of the feed along with the total digestible nutrients are given in Tables II and III the nitrogen balance is shown in Table IV.

It has, however turned out to be inferior to wheat bhusa as it is one and a half times richer in protein than sugarcane though total digestible nutrients in both the cases are almost the same. No doubt wheat bhusa contains higher percentage of fibre, but its digestibility is higher than that of sugarcane (Wheat bhusa contains 25.0 per cent digestible crude fibre while sugarcane contains 16.7 per cent only on dry matter basis). In order to bring up wheat bhusa and sugarcane to a maintenance level, heifers No. 199 and J. D. were given wheat bhusa ad lib. and 42 gm. of nitrogen in toria cake and heifers 171,200 and 212 were fed 45 gm. of nitrogen in toria cake with sugarcane given ad lib. With almost equal amounts of added nitrogen in their daily ration the heifers fed on wheat bhusa showed a positive daily nitrogen balance of 14 gm., whilst the group fed on sugarcane showed a positive daily nitrogen balance of 4.5 gm. only (Table V, which indicates the superiority of the protein in wheat bhusa.

SHELL SEALING OF EGGS By T. S. KRISHNAN, Poultry Research Section, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (Received for publication on 16 June 1947) (With one text-figure) THE efficiency of lime and water-glass for egg preservation under Indian conditions was studied by Macdonald and Krishnan [1943]. The preservative action of these substancer is generally attributed to the sealing of the egg shell pores; which ensues during the storage in their solution. An attempt has been made to determine the minimum time required to effect this. An increase in size of the egg air-cell is due to evaporation of water from the egg contents, which, other factors remaining the same, depends on the porosity of the egg-shell. In this work it has been assumed that the degree of shell-sealing is inversely proportional to the increase in air-cell depth, i.e., the more complete the sealing, the smaller the increase in air-cell size and vice versa. Day-old infertile eggs were soaked for varying periods in lime-water and water-glass, prepared as usual [Macdonald and Krishnan, 1943], and then put into an incubator at 100°F. along with an equal number of similar but untreated eggs. After seven days storage, lots of twelve eggs were taken from each of the above series and the depth of the air-cell in each egg was measured (see Table I).

IV] T. S. KRISHNAN 267 view is further supported by the fact that the sealing is quicker and more complete in fresh eggs, which generally contain more CO2, than in old ones, which usually contain much less of this gas. With water-glass the sealing is probably due to the deposition in the pores of insoluble gelatinous SiO2 formed by the hydrolytic dissociation of the Na2SiO3 and its consolidation with time. This, as has been observed, is evidently a slow process. To determine the effect of shell-sealing on the keeping quality of eggs, a comparative study of the interior quality of similar lots of treated and untreated infertile eggs stored at 100°F. (summer conditions) was made. The treatment given was immersion for 12 hours in lime-water. Water- glass was abandoned as being too slow for practical commercial application. The results of the study are presented in Fig. 1. It was found in each test that the interior quality, as judged by albumen index (Average diameter Height of thick white), percentage thick white and yolk index (Height/Diameter of yolk), was somewhat better in the treated eggs than in the untreated ones. The air-cell depth, however, showed a marked difference in the two lots. The treated ones had a signi- ficantly smaller air-cell depth than the controls at all stages of the storage period. In the above experiment, which simulates summer conditions, the maximum allowable air-cell depth of 9.5 mm. (3/8 in.) according to the Agricultural Grading and Marking Act, was attained in the untreated eggs in four days, while in the treated ones this level was reached only after 11 days. In the commercial grading of eggs by candling, considerable weight is attached to air-cell size.

MOOR, V.M.D., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania THE results obtained with local injections of penicillin in the treatment of empyema, mastoiditis and chronic wound sinuses in man due to staphylococcus or streptococcus infection, as reported by the Floreys,1 the National Research Council's Committee on Chemotherapeutic and Other Agents,2 and by Lyons,3 suggest that intramammary injections via the teat canal might be effective in catarrhal mastitis, also called chronic mastitis. In this form of mastitis, conditions exist that have been found favourable to the action of local injections in treating human patients, viz., the infection is situated in a closed cavity or space from which the contents can be readily withdrawn, and the infection is localized and accessible. Frei4 and other investigators have found that in catarrhal mastitis due to streptococci, it is the excretory channels that are involved, usually the milk cistern and the larger ducts primarily, while clinical symptoms indicate that the disease is similarly situated when it is caused by staphylococci. In this location the causative organisms are readily accessible to solutions introduced through the teat canal while any exudate present can be readily milked out before making an injection. Most clini- cians with experience in treating human patients with the drug are of the opinion that local injections should be supplemented by intravenous or intramuscular injections but recovery or improvement has been obtained in the conditions mentioned above with local injections alone. It was decided to test the action of intramammary injections of penicillin on the staphylococci which cause mastitis and also to determine the effect on the cow, especially on the under tissue. The penicillin used was prepared specifically for this study by Dr Waltee Kocholaty, Thos. H. Dougherty, Jr. Fellow in Research in Brucellosis, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, in July, 1943. Staphylococci are one of the causes of catarrhal mastitis and the symptoms they produce are similar to those caused by streptococci. They also cause a severe type of acute perenchymatous mastitis which is often complicated by sepsis, and gangrene of the udder is frequently associated with it. This type of udder infection was selected because clinical results show that it is more re- sistant to the agents now used in intramammary injections than the mastitis streptococci, and also because in in vitro tests penicillin was found to be more effective than some of these agents against Staphylococcus aureus. Fleming5 found it four times as potent as sulfathiazole and twenty times as potent as sulfapyridine against this organism, and Heilman and Herrell6 found it more effective than gramicidin. Identification of mastitis staphylococci In examining samples of milk or other udder secretions for the staphylococci which cause mastitis, it is necessary to differentiate them from the nonpathogenic cocci, usually called micrococci, which are normally present in the udder and the milk. * From the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. In accordance with regulations formulated by the War Production Board, concerning the production and use of peni- cillin, permission was requested and received by Dr G. A. Dick, Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine, to produce and use a limited amount of penicillin for the purpose of this study. At the request of Dr A. N. Richards, Vice President of the University of Pennsylvania and Chairman of the Committee on Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, publication of the findings of this study has been withheld until the present. The contents of this paper were, however, submitted in confidence on April, 29, 1944, to the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agricul- ture, and to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Publication of this article has been cleared through the Committee on Medical Research, National Research Council.

270 Effect of Penicillin Injections on Staphylococci [XVII Minett7 found that hemolysis on ox-blood or sheep-blood agar and coagulation of human or rabbit-blood plasma were characteristic of staphylococci isolated from milk samples, from udder quarters affected with chronic mastitis, and from the affected quarters of cows showing symptoms of acute, septic parenchymatous mastitis, and that it is improbable that cocci recovered from samples of milk from normal quarters, which do not possess these properties, are pathogenic. Plastridge and his associates8 examined staphylococci isolated from milk samples from individual quarters of milking cows for their ability to hemolyze ox-blood and coagulate human-blood plasma, for pigment formation, leucocyte count, and other properties, using the leucocyte count as an index of patho- genicity.

From the results obtained, they concluded that ability to coagulate rabbit or human-blood plasma is more closely related to pathogenicity than any other property. The greater number of the coaguse positive strains were hemolytic but some were not. They also concluded that staphylococci from the udder which are hemolytic on ox-blood agar are usually pathogenic whether they have coagulative ability or not, as are also staphylococci associated with a leucocyte count of 500,000 or over provided the cow is not in the early or late stage of lactation. They found no definite correlation between pigment formation and the leucocyte count. Nearly as many strains of staphylococci associated with a low leucocyte count produced pigmented colonies as those associated with a high count. Chapman, Berens, Peters, and Curcio,9 who studied staphylococci of human origin and determined pathogenicity by injecting cultures into rabbits, found that while strains which coagulated human- blood plasma were usually pathogenic regardless of the color of the colonies, those which produced hemolytic yellow colonies were usually pathogenic regardless of coagulative ability and hemolytic noncoagulating strains that produced white colonies were usually nonpathogenic. Plan of experiment In selecting the cows for this experiment, ability to hemolyze ox-blood, coagulate human-blood plasma, and produce pigment were used, together with the leucocyte count, to differentiate patho- genic staphylococci from the nonpathogenic cocci (micrococci) which are commonly present in cow's milk. The methods by which these determinations were made are described below. Samples of milk were taken from each quarter of the udder at the time of the evening milking but before the cow was milked. After the udder had been prepared in the usual way to prevent external contamination, three streams were expressed from the quarter and discarded, and 15 to 20 c.c. of milk were then drawn into a sterile container, which was placed in a refrigerator until removed to the laboratory.

A great variation in the number of staphy- lococci in samples from the same source, even when they are collected at short intervals, has been reported by a number of investigators.

Since one of the quarters receiving 8 injections was apparently cleared of the infection and another was probably cleared, while the infection disappeared only temporarily from the quarters receiving 4 injections, it would appear that a more prolonged antibacterial action was produced by 8 injections than by 4, although given within the same period of time. However, since no growth of staphylococci occurred on any of the plates inoculated with samples 2 to 5, inclusive, it is possible that they contained sufficient penicillin to inhibit growth of the organism and that growth occurred on the plates inoculated with samples taken subsequently because all of the penicillin injected had been absorbed or eliminated. Referring to Table IV, it will be noted that sample 6 from the right front quarter of cow 10 was infected with coagulase positive nonhemolytic staphylococci but that the staphylococci found in samples 7 and 9 were hemolytic. A similar variation was observed in milk samples examined before the injections were made. Coagulase positive nonhemolytic staphylococci were present in a sample taken from this quarter 12 days before sample 1. The first ¼ to ½ of the milk obtained from three of the quarters receiving injections at six-hour intervals contained slugs or strings of mucus and was watery after the first injection and the milk of the other quarter receiving the same treatment was similarly affected after the second injection. Later, this portion of the milking was of a greenish or yellowish color. This condition continued up to the time of taking samples 5, six hours after the last injection. Similar changes occurred in the milk of the quarters receiving 4 injections at eight-hour intervals but to a lesser degree. The milk of one quarter in this group was altered in appearance after the first injection and of the other two after the second injection. The milk of one of the latter was of normal appearance at all other succeeding examinations. When samples 6 were taken on the third day following the last injection, the milk of all quarters was of normal appearance. The average daily milk production for one week before and for the first, second, and third weeks after treatment are shown in the following Table:IV] LOUIS A. KLEIN, DAVID W. CRISMAN, AND JOHN W. MOOR 275 SUMMARY Seven udder quarters, infected with staphylococci, with characteristics corresponding to those of mastitis staphylococci, were given injections via the teat canal of a solution of penicillin in sterile, normal saline solution. Four quarters were given 8 injections of 500 c.c. each at intervals of six hours and 3 received 4 injections at intervals of 12 hours. Each dose contained 22,800 Oxford units of penicillin. Samples of milk were taken for laboratory examination immediately before the first injection, at intervals of 12 hours during the injection period, and on the third sixth, tenth, and thirteenth days following. Laboratory examinations indicated that the samples from all of the quarters taken after the first injection were free of the staphylococcus infection. The samples taken subsequently, up to six and twelve hours after the last injection, were also free, but infection again developed on the plates inoculated with samples taken from five quarters on the third or sixth day after the last injec- tion. The original staphylococcus infection has apparently been destroyed in the two other quarters. Both of these quarters received 8 injections. The results indicate that the antibacterial action continued for twelve hours but 4 doses were not sufficient to obtain a permanent effect. REFERENCES 1Florey, M. E., and Florey, H. W. (1941).
