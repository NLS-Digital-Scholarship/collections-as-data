The control of vaccination in one selected District of each Registration Circle continued to be exercised by the Local Board of that District. Changes in area and administration 2. The municipality of Karachi took over control of vaccina- tion in Karachi town from the Assistant Director of Public Health, Sind Registration District, from 1st April 1923 in accordance with Government Order, General Department, No. 7472, dated 21st June 1921. Control and supervision of vaccination in the Sachin State has been taken over by the State Authorities from 1st January 1924. Vaccination of the civil population in the Belgaum Cantonment was taken over by the Cantonment Committee and placed in the hands of the Medical Officer in charge of Cantonment Hospital in October 1922, but on the hospital being reduced to the status of a dispensary there was no staff available for the work and it was, therefore, handed back to the Public Health Department on 1st June 1923. In Sind 1,866 villages are said to have been depopulated. The reporting of results of vaccination in Bushire has been discontinued at the request of the Residency Surgeon there, for the reason that &quot; Bushire is a purely Persian town, administered by Persian officials who keep no records of any kind and the preparation of a return worth anything is impossible.&quot; Changes amongst staff. 3. During the year under report the office of the Director of Public Health was held by Lieut.-Colonel H. M. H. Melhuish, D.S.O., I.M.S., from 1st April to 29th March 1924 and for the remaining two days by Lieut.-Colonel W.O'S. Murphy, I.M.S. The 5 Assistant Directors of Public Health were the supervising officers in the respective Vaccination Districts and the only changes were transfers inter se. Thus Drs. Dalal and Munsiff were in charge of the Southern and Western Registration Districts, respectively, throughout, and for practically the whole year Dr. da Gama held charge in the Central Registration District and Dr. Pinto in Guzerat. In Sind Dr. Shiveshwarkar was in charge after 15th April 1923 prior to which date the Officer in charge Public Health Laboratory (Dr. F. Barretto) was A. D. P. H. in addition to his own duties. Dr. R. W. Fisher was Director of the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, from 1st April to 25th October 1923, the date preceding his death, when Dr. Dalal took over. Retrenchment. 4. Three District Local Boards selected vaccination as the service in which they could most conveniently economise and one of them, Thar and Parkar, insisted on reducing their vaccination P 22 staff from 13 to 7 thereby leaving large areas without vaccinators' service for long intervals. It is to be noted that the district in question is subject to exploitation by unprincipled operators who use live small-pox virus as vaccine, thus implanting the disease itself. The saving to the District Local Board as a result of this economy at the expense of human life and sickness amounts to Rs. 3,936 per annum. 5. Necessary reductions in vaccination staff were the abolition of the post of Municipal vaccinator for Tatta town from 1st August 1923 (G.R., G.D., No. 4107, dated 20th June 1923) and the reduction of the large staff of 11 vaccinators (engaged during epidemic small-pox in 1922) in Aden to 5. Bhor State strengthened their staff by appointing a candidate vaccinator. Primary Vaccinations. (Appendix I, Statements I and III.) 6. Compared with the preceding year, 1923-24 showed an increase in births that would be expected to result in an increase in the number of persons primarily vaccinated. On the other hand, the vaccination figures from Aden show a large drop as the unprotected persons available for vaccination became exhausted. On the whole there is a slight decrease; the figure of primary vaccinations for the year being 631,850 as compared with 633,602 in 1922-23. Leaving Aden out of consideration the figures for 1923-24 compared with those for 1922-23 show an increase (from 587,737 to 616,320) in primary vaccination in all Vaccination Districts and this is attributable to the prevalence of small-pox in the greater part of the Presidency. Re-vaccination work also showed increase in all the Districts except the Southern Registration District where there was a slight decrease. Results in Primary Vaccinations. 7. Out of 631,850 vaccinations, 559,329 or 88.52 per cent. were successful, 1,473 or .25 per cent. were unsuccessful and the results could not be ascertained in 11.23 per cent. of the cases. Owing to failure of the first operation 73 persons were operated on a second time. Age and Sex. 8. Of the primary vaccinations, 477,082 or 75 per cent. were of infants under one year of age and 134,508 or 21 per cent. of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years. By sex, 330,921 were males and 300,929 females equal to a proportion of 109.97 to 100, a preponderance of males rather greater than shown in births regis- tered (108.52 to 100). Re-vaccinations. (Appendix I, Statements I and III.) 9. 112,268 persons were re-vaccinated against 99,141 in the last year showing an increase of 13,127. The percentage of successful
3 re-vaccinations was 47.81; the results in 51.23 per cent. (excluded from this calculation) could not be ascertained. The increase in re-vaccinations in the Guzerat Registration District is attributed to the large number of prisoners at the Sabarmati Central Jail and to the efforts of Missionaries, amongst their communities at Godhra and Anand during the prevalence of small-pox in the latter part of the year. In Sind, two districts show a decrease in work. The reduction in staff in Thar and Parkar already referred to left Jamesabad, Sanghar, Chachro, Diplo and part of Khipro Talukas without any vaccinators while in Sukkur the decrease is attributed to migration of people from Mirpur, Ghotki and Ubauro Talukas owing to lack of inundation. The high percentage of unknown cases in both primary and re-vaccinations is due to the migratory nature of the population in Sind and Aden. In Aden specially, it is impossible to estimate the number of successful cases. Vaccinations in Native States. (Appendix II, Statement I.) 10. In the Native States 177,881 persons were primarily vacci- nated against 175,692. The number of successful cases was 174,618 or 98.15. The percentage of success excluding unknown was 99.40. Re-vaccinations numbered 12,940 against 8,665 in the previous year. The results were inspected in 75.21 per cent. of these re- vaccinations and showed a per cent. success rate of 72.82. Vaccination of Pilgrims at Karachi. 11. The temporary vaccination establishment consisting of one male vaccinator, one female vaccinator, one clerk and one cooly for the vaccination of pilgrims proceeding to Hedjaj, vaccinated 7,455 pilgrims against 4,390. Of these 7,133 sailed from the port and the remaining 322 were indigent, could not purchase tickets and had to go back to their native places. The total expenditure on vaccina- tion was Rs. 668-14-10 against Rs. 702-4-0 in the previous year. Total number of operations. 12. The total number of primary vaccinations including those in Native States amounts to 809,731 and the total of re-vaccinations 125,208. Incidence of small-pox. 13. As regards the incidence of small-pox, all the Registration Districts except the Southern Registration District and Aden Settlement returned a large number of deaths. In Guzerat infection was brought from the adjoining Gaikwad territory. The epidemic first broke out in Kapadvanj Town in November 1923, but was not reported by the local authorities and thus remained unnoticed for nearly a month whilst this town and villages around were fast becoming potent centres of further spread
4 of infection. Surat also was affected early. In Aden, following on the efficient vaccination campaign, there were only 18 cases of small- pox of which 16 were imported during the year and there were 6 deaths against 69 in the previous year. Vaccination campaigns. 14. As usual a special vaccination campaign among school children in municipal towns and Taluka head-quarters of all dis- tricts except Surat in the Guzerat Registration District, was carried out last season by all the Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination. The percentage of inspected children found unprotected was 5.63 which shows an improvement over the figures of the last year. In the Western R. D. investigation showed that there was growing indifference to vaccination on the part of the public, particularly in Khandesh, resulting in a large increase in the number of un- protected amongst the younger children. Systematic vaccination campaigns were advised by the Assistant Director of Public Health and when Dhulia and Malegaon were overtaken by epidemic small-pox, local bodies took action. The Officers of the Depart- ment generally used all the means at their command to check the spread of the epidemic and several local bodies took the matter up when the enemy ( small-pox) was upon them. The indifference of the public in many places is impossible to overcome and as an instance in Kolaba District testifies where the advice and efforts of local officers and the local body failed to prevail. Anti-vaccination movements. 15. Organised active anti-vaccination propaganda still continues in Hyderabad town (Sind). In Surat City also it came to the notice of the Assistant Director of Public Health, Guzerat Registra- tion District, that an anti-vaccination campaign was being conducted by certain persons by distribution of leaflets and publication of articles in local vernacular papers. The A. D. P. H. thereupon discussed the situation with the Health Officer and advised counter propaganda. This advice was acted upon and there is reason to believe that it succeeded in nullifying the effects produced by the movement. In spite of such misguiding efforts, vaccination continues on the whole to maintain its position in the estimation of the people as a sure defence against small-pox. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. 16. The ammonia compressing machine was fitted with an ice making arrangement to replace the old Co. 2 machine. The new plant has been successful in making ice sufficient for the various processes in preparation, purification, etc., of the vaccine lymph. Repairs were done to the cold store rooms. Government have sanc- tioned an additional allotment of Rs. 735 for complete lining of the cold room and ante-room walls of the refrigerating plant with asbestos sheeting. The work will shortly be taken in hand by the Electrical Department.
5 The old spare engine installed during the year 1922-23 was removed by the Electrical Engineer to Government as it did not carry sufficient load and in its place one Gardner engine of 25 B. H. P. with a dynamo was installed to carry on in case any of the two engines struck work. Water-supply was insufficient in the dry season and the new well not answering expectation, water carts had to be engaged to supplement the supply. The drainage system worked well during the year. During the year 1923-24, 1,184,957 doses of lymph were issued from the Institute against 1,172,800, an increase of 12,157 over 1922-23. Zanzibar Government were supplied with 28,000 doses, Aden with 9,200 and including these a total of 101,302 doses were issued apart from the supply to contributing bodies. A vacancy that occurred in the superintending staff in 1922 was filled by appointing a young veterinary graduate. The advantage of having a man so qualified to inspect batches of new calves and attend to any outbreaks of illness amongst the stock is manifold. There was no epizootic during the year. The quality of vaccina- tion on the calves was satisfactory. The passage of lymph strains through rabbits maintained the potency of seed lymph at a high level. Seed lymphs were supplied to the King Institute, Madras, and Padukotah State. Careful selection of vesicles at the time of collection from calves is the explanation of the Director for the slightly reduced yield of pulp per calf vaccinated but he adds that it also explains the compensatory advantage in the way of marked reduction in the number of lymphs rejected after trial on children. Attempt was made to test in this way the potency of every lymph manufactured. The gross expenditure of the Institute for the year 1923-24 amounted to Rs. 60,260-3-8 against Rs. 73,260-13-10. The net expenditure after deducting sale proceeds from non-contributing constituents was Rs. 46,474-2-6 against Rs. 58,291-6-11. The death of Dr. Fisher mentioned in an earlier paragraph is a grievous loss to the Institute and to vaccination in general. Lieut.-Colonel Hutchinson, C.I.E., I.M.S., in 1911 after he had him- self fully established the feasibility of the manufacture and use of glycerinated calf lymph and of its use in the Presidency in substitu- tion of the older arm-to-arm and calf-to-arm methods and when his scheme of an up-to-date Institute had materialized, selected Dr. Fisher as its first Director. His proposals in this as in the scheme generally were wisely adopted by Government and Dr. Fisher to the end devoted his untiring energy and his many talents to the very special work of his appointment. His conduct of the Institute and his technical work drew expressions of appreciation from officials, medical scientists and others. For his work at Belgaum, his University (Queen's University, Belfast) awarded him in 1922 the M.D. with gold medal, and a few months before he went to his Great Reward he received from Government the Kaiser-i- Hind Medal6 Lymph in use for vaccination. 17. All vaccinations were performed with glycerinated lymph manufactured at the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, and the following table shows the results obtained:7 from small-pox during five years in those towns in which Compulsory Vaccination Act has been in force :8 This is much to be deprecated. The present staff is none too strong in number and further weakening with its immediate consequence, and increase in the number of unprotected children, will certainly facilitate the spread of epidemic small-pox and lead to increased fatality from that disease in the Presidency.

Selected Districts.2 8. Increase or decrease in work.3 a large unprotected child population had accumulated and small-pox sprang up in several places. The matter was referred to Govern- ment who were pleased to approve of the proposal to restore the vaccination staff to the original strength for six months (vide G.R., G.D., No. 5358, dated 19th March 1925) and additional vaccinators have been appointed since April 1925. The epidemic of small-pox prevailed in Belgaum and Bijapur. The municipal vaccinators at Belgaum and Bijapur towns made house to house visits during January to March. In Bijapur town assistance of private medical practitioners was enlisted in carrying out vaccination work vigorously. Failure to notify the appearance of infection until epidemic was established and beyond control is again to be recorded in a number of places. The attention of the district officials concerned was called to the dereliction. 13. Vaccination Campaign.4 An outbreak of Rinderpest during the year caused heavy loss to the Institute. The first case appeared in November in the selected stables that is in a calf that had completed the regulation period of 10 days in the Isolation Stables. This suggests that infection was introduced in the person of one of the stable attendants that live outside the Institute. In all 47 cases with 34 deaths occurred before the outbreak terminated on December 15th. The staff passed through a particularly anxious and trying time while the epizootic lasted. The Veterinary Assistant of the Belgaum Veterinary Dispensary gave valuable assistance in treating sick animals and carrying out prophylactic inoculation. The Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, was consulted in connection with the outbreak and he has arranged for his veterinary assistants in Belgaum, Dharwar and Bijapur districts to notify the Institute of all outbreaks of infectious disease. It is hoped that the calf contractors will, if only in their own interests, make use of the information passed on to them. The Veterinary Graduate on the staff of the Institute was deputed to Bombay for courses of instruction in Bacteriology and Hygiene under G.R., G. D., No. 2187 dated 27th March 1925. A vacancy in the Superintending staff was filled by the appointment of an L.C.P.S. The usual training class for vaccinators was held at the Institute from 1st July to 30th September 1924. Out of seven candidates who attended the course, five (one from the Southern and two from the Western Registration Districts and two from West Khandesh District Local Board) passed the examination. The gross expenditure of the Institute for the year 1924-25 amounted to Rs. 60,647-12-2 against Rs. 60,260-3-8. The net expenditure after deducting sale proceeds from non-contributing constituents was Rs. 40,129-3-10 against Rs. 46,474-2-6. The quality of vaccination on the calves was satisfactory. The practice of testing the potency of every lymph manufactured in the Institute on children, before issue to vaccinators introduced during the previous year, was continued. Strict and careful selection of vesicles at the time of collection resulted in a somewhat reduced yield of pulp per calf vaccinated but this was balanced by the reduction to zero of the number of lymphs calling for rejection after trial on children. The potency of lymph was maintained at a high level by passage through rabbits. 1,177,570 doses of lymph were issued during the year as against 1,184,957. Of these 100,330 were supplied to Civil Medical Officers of Zanzibar, Aden, Goa and Persian Gulf. A Chart shewing the results of primary vaccinations in the five Registration Districts and Bombay City for each month of the year under report and the previous year is attached.
5 His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, P.C., G.C.I.E., C.M.G., D.S.O., and Lady Wilson visited the Institute on the 25th of August 1924. Lymph in use for Vaccination. 15.

Small-pox prevailed in a severe form during the first quarter of the year in Surat, Broach and Ahmedabad districts. This infection in Guzerat continued over from last year. It gradually died out in Broach and Kaira Districts but elsewhere it lurked on in a mild form during the second and third quarters of the year and again assumed an epidemic form in Surat District. It also appeared in Bijapur, East Khandesh, Thana, Sholapur, Larkana, Sukkur and Aden. In Aden extensive house to house inspection and vaccination work was carried out vigorously with the assistance of an additional temporary establishment engaged for the purpose. Failure to notify the appearance of infection until the epidemic was well established and beyond control occurred as usual in a number of places. 11.

(6) Hostel for vaccinators and graduates attending the special training classes held at the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. On April 6th, 1925, Dr. R. D. Dalal went on six months' leave prepara- tory to retirement after over 27 years' valuable service of which the last 1 year, 5 months and 11 days were spent as Director of the Vaccine Institute. Lymph in Use 13. The quality of lymph supplied from the Belgaum Vaccine Insti- tute was excellent, no other lymph being used in the Registration Circles.

Cost of Vaccination.9 The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Rs. 1-0-10 against Rs. 1-1-2 in the previous year and Rs. 1-1-1 in 1923-24. The average annual expenditure for the triennium amounted to Rs. 6,19,519 against Rs. 6,09,892 in the preceding triennium, whilst the average number of successful primary and re-vaccinations (excluding vaccinations at dispensaries) came to 581,657 against 550,735, the average cost per each successful case during the triennium being Rs. 1-1-0 against Rs. 1-1-9 in the last triennium. 15. Inspection work of the Assistant Directors of Public Health and Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination.10 vaccinations performed during the two years preceding and the four decennial periods succeeding the introduction of the Act.:ii Karachi.12 Ahmedabad.13 were fined while 2 cases are still pending. The amount realised from fines was Rs. 20. In Sukkur 5 persons were prosecuted, of these 2 were fined, the amount realised being Rs. 12. In Deolali Cantonment the Act was introduced in August 1915. During the triennial period under review the average annual number of primary vaccinations performed was 175 against 102 in the preceding triennium. In Aden the Compulsory Vaccination Act came into force on 28th December 1916. During the year 1925-26, 41,030 primary and 40,760 re-vaccinations were performed against 10,260 and 5,376 during the preceding year. Four male and three female vaccinators were temporarily engaged during a small-pox epidemic. 21 attacks and 5 deaths from small-pox occurred during the year against 27 attacks and 2 deaths in 1924-25. The average annual number of primary vaccinations performed during the triennial period was 22,295 against 17,089 in the last triennium. The increase is due in main to the occurrence of this small-pox epidemic and partly to the enlargement in the vaccination establishment. 17.

A Diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination during the seven-year periods ending with each of the three years of the triennial period is given as Appendix IV. GENERAL 21. As usual a class was held from 1st July to 30th September 1925 at the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum. Of nine candidates who attended the class, seven passed. Four Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination were trained in the process of manufacture and preparation of lymph and in practical vaccination work. Two candidates for Inspectors' and five for vaccinators' posts were tested by the Assistant Director of Public Health, Southern Registration District. The Collector of Thar Parkar issued a circular requiring all Revenue officials, Zamindars and other respectable persons to help in the cause of vaccination. A proposal was submitted by the Collector to maintain vaccination registers in the villages to enable the Revenue officials to inspect them and to see the amount of work done by the vaccinators while on tour. This procedure is being adopted in Thar Parkar District and if extended to other districts would be of great value to the cause of Public Health. H.

Changes in the strength of establishment.3 Primary Vaccination (Appendix I, Statements I and III) 5. During the year 1926-27, 663,052 persons were primarily vaccinated against 673,235 in the previous year. The decrease is observed in the Southern, Gujarat and Sind Registration Districts. The main cause of the decrease is the prevalence of cholera towards the end of vaccination year in the Karnatik. The services of vaccinators in the badly affected Talukas were utilized for cholera duty. In Kanara the decrease is due to the fact that during the previous year there was Small-pox prevailing in the District and large numbers of vaccinations had been performed exceeding the total average fixed. The work of vaccination in the Selected District of Bijapur was found on the increase and satisfactory. The decrease in Sind Registration District occurred after Septem- ber 1926 owing to heavy rains and floods in almost the whole of Sind which made travelling difficult for vaccinators and people were unwilling to get their children vaccinated during such unsettled conditions and partly to the prevalence of malaria. Some vaccina- tors could not visit all the villages in their charges owing to the distances between these being too great to be completed in one year, and the prevalence of Small-pox necessitating their presence in the affected parts. The highest decrease was noticeable in the Sukkur (Selected) District. 6. Results.4 vaccination of these pilgrims amounted to Rs. 871-9-0. In the preceding year 2,803 pilgrims were vaccinated and the total expen- diture amounted to Rs. 621-11-4. 10. In the Native States 75,225 persons were primarily vaccinated against 74,783 in 1925-26. The number of successful cases was 74,639 or 99.22 per cent. The percentage of success excluding unknown was 99.85. Re-vaccinations numbered 4,802 against 6,315 in the previous year. The success rate excluding unknown cases was 74.87. 11. Total operations.5 vaccinations were performed in Poona City ; 642 in the Suburban area; and 733 in the two Military Cantonments. Two special vaccinators were entertained by the Municipalities of Poona City and Poona Suburban. In some cases it was noticed that timely intimation of appearance of Small-pox was not given owing to the ignorance or carelessness of village officers. Attention of the Revenue Authorities was frequently drawn to this glaring neglect and it is hoped that such cases will decrease as the village officials are made to understand their responsibility in this connection. 13.

7 Expenditure.8 Rs. 8,084. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination remains the same as last year, i.e., Rs. 1-0-10. The decrease in expenditure is attributable to the Civil Surgeon, Nasik, holding charge of the office of the Assistant Director of Public Health, Western Registration District, in addition to his own duties from 2nd February 1927 which resulted in saving in salary till the appointment of a full time Assistant Director of Public Health. Besides, the replacement of senior Inspectors of Sanitation by junior ones augmented to these savings. In Sind the decrease in expenditure is due to the fact that the cost of temporary vaccination establishment entertained in Thar and Parkar District paid from Provincial Revenues in the previous year was debited to Local Funds during the year under report. Inspection work of the Assistant Directors of Public Health and Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination 17. The Assistant Directors of Public Health inspected 18,917 vaccinated persons or 3.29 per cent. in 655 towns and villages and they travelled 30,468 miles. The Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination inspected 214,242 persons in 9,610 towns and villages travelling 694,036 miles. Thus the results of 233,159 vaccina- tions or 40.48 per cent. were checked by examination. The success rate of primary vaccinations as ascertained by the Assistant Directors of Public Health was 97.08 and by Inspectors 96.54. Compulsory Vaccination 18. The Compulsory Vaccination Act has been newly introduced in Bhusawal Town in East Khandesh. Compulsory Vaccination Act in Belgaum Cantonment continued ; during the year vaccination was done by a part-time Vaccinator and his work was also supervised by a part-time Inspector of Sanitation and Vaccination. The working of the Act did not run as satisfactorily as it should have been. So the Belgaum Canton- ment Board desired to carry out the work by the Medical personnel of the Military Department to facilitate the enforcing of the Act and the control has been transferred to the Military. In Aden four male and three female temporary vaccinators were engaged in addition to the present five vaccinators. The total number of vaccinations and re-vaccinations performed in the whole Settlement of Aden was 28,136 and 8,060 respectively against 41,030 and 40,760 during the preceding year. There were 10 attacks and 2 deaths from small-pox against 21 and 5 in the previous year. In Deolali Cantonment there were 142 primary vaccinations performed by the S.M.S. Officer in charge of Canton- ment Hospital, Deolali, of which 121 cases were returned as successful giving a percentage of 100; 109 persons were re-vaccinated of which 50 persons were returned as successful giving a percentage of 52.08. At the recommendation of the Assistant Director of Public Health, Sind Registration District, the Hyderabad Municipality sanctioned the appointment of an additional vaccination Karkun.
9 Hyderabad is still backward in vaccination. The percentage of children under one year successfully vaccinated in Karachi town was 76.17 and in Hyderabad town 32.21. Except in Ahmedabad and Karachi Cities the bye-laws regarding Registration of Births and Deaths were not enforced in any of the other places with the result that a large number of births escaped registration and the number of children procurable for vaccination was in consequence smaller than it should have been. Such children provide a potential source of danger to the com- munity, and it is for Local Bodies to realise this risk and see that all the births which occur in their areas are registered and the children vaccinated. The following table shows the progress made in the protection of infants, during the year under report, and the number of deaths from small-pox during five years in those towns in which the Act has been in force.

In Sukkur town 6 persons were prosecuted of these 5 got their children vaccinated and one died. In Rohri town 3 persons were prosecuted. Of these one got his child vaccinated and 2 were discharged by the Court. 19. Inoculation was practised in Shahdadkot and Thul Talukas, Jacobabad District, and Tando Allahyar Taluka, Hyderabad Dis- trict. In Shahdadkot Taluka the Mukhtiarkar reported that people were warned and they promised not to allow any private agency to carry on inoculation amongst their children in future. In Thul Taluka 4 persons were fined Rs. 15 each for getting their children inoculated. In Tando Allahyar Taluka, the Mukhtiarkar reported that sufficient proof could not be had and stated that the enquiry made in the matter which created a deep impression among the people, will serve as a deterant against any further recurrence of this sort. The District Magistrate having agreed with the Mukhtiarkar the matter was dropped and the vaccinator was asked to report any fresh cases of inoculations with sufficient evidence if detected by him. A Circular was issued to all the Collectors and Deputy Commis- sioner, Upper Sind Frontier, informing them that although arm to arm vaccination had been abolished since many years some vacci- nators taking advantage of the ignorance of the village people threaten to use their vaccinated children as vaccinifers for purpose of extorting money, and requesting them to ask the Revenue Officials to make a special effort to remove the ignorance of the people in this respect and to inform them to report in such cases to the Mukhtiarkar or Collector. 20. A statement showing the number of vaccinations under one year of age in Municipal Towns is attached as Appendix III. 21. No cases of infectious diseases due to importation of infec- tion from pilgrim centres were reported. A case of Small-pox was reported from Dakore Town Circle which was imported. It having been brought to the notice of the Director of Public Health by a leading gentleman of Surat City that two of his grand- daughters were attacked with Small-pox soon after they were vaccinated and that several similar instances had occurred which led to the public suspecting the purity of the lymph and attribut- ing the attack of Small-pox to vaccination. A careful enquiry was instituted as a result of which it was ascertained that in these two instances the children had picked up infection from the children of domestic servants three of whom had small-pox in a severe form and one of whom had died. All these were residing in the same compound. The two children regarding whom the report was received were vaccinated during the incubation period and as a result of vaccination the disease affected them only in a modified form. The fact that 28 other children were vaccinated on the same day and from the same number of lymph as the above two children and'
11 not one of these was affected with Small-pox, provides further proof of the purity and potency of the lymph. The results of the enquiry and the means adopted to ensure the purity and potency of lymph at the Vaccine Institute were communicated to the complainant and were published in the leading Vernacular Journal of Surat. 22. A diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination during the seven years from 1st April 1920 to 31st March 1927 and the death rate from Small-pox for the year 1926- 1927 is given as Appendix IV. General Remarks 23. The Training Class was held at the Vaccine Institute, Belgaum, from 1st July to 30th September 1926. Out of 11 candidates who attended the class 10 passed. The Assistant Director of Public Health, Southern Registration District, inspected the work of one candidate sent to him from Gujarat Registration District for being trained for the Inspector's post. He also inspected the work of six candidates from the Bijapur District and the Vaccinator Vengurla Peta who was deputed for a refresher course. He examined all of them by getting vaccination work done by them in his presence and found them possessing manual dexterity in the technique of operations. The Inspectors of Sanitation and Vaccination were asked to attend the Baby Week celebrations with instructions to render assistance to the Secretaries of the Committees and to give demon- strations to the public on vaccination as a prophylactic measure against Small-pox with the help of the Vaccinators of the respective places. Necessary materials were supplied by the Assistant Director of Public Health, Southern Registration District, to the Inspector of Sanitation and Vaccination, Bijapur District, who was in charge of the stall. Generally the services of the Inspectors were useful at these shows and their work was appreciated by the Public and the Baby Week Celebration Committees. During the year 6 influential men were granted &quot; Afrin-Nama &quot; by the Assistant Director of Public Health, Sind Registration District, for rendering help to the Inspectors and Vaccinators in the cause of vaccination.

In Gujarat heavy rains and floods extending over large areas put a stop to the work of the vaccinators who were employed on Flood Relief duties for a time. The following table shows the number of children under one year available for vaccination calculated (1) on the number of births registered less deaths under one year ; and (2) on probable number of births at 31 per 1000 of population less deaths4 For the Presidency as a whole the percentages were (1) 65.50 and (2) 83.08. The deficiency in Birth Registration in Sind is very noticeable. 7. Results.5 Re-vaccinations numbered 3,729 against 4,802 in the previous year. The success rate, excluding 355 unknown results was 67.66. 12.

The cost of vaccination came to Rs. 646,283 against Rs. 616,932. The increase in the expenditure is chiefly due to an item of Rs. 16,768 for electrical energy supplied by the Electrical Engineer's Department to the Vaccine Institute, which is now debited to 33 Public Health. The appointment of a full time Director of the Vaccine Institute and increments to the pay of various Officers account for the remainder. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was Rs. 1-1-9 against Rs. 1-0-10 in the previous year. Vaccine Institute, Belgaum 17. The Vaccine Institute under its new Director Dr. J. B. Mama, transferred from the Public Health Laboratory Poona of which he has been in charge since 1st April 1911, had a successful year's work, 102,697 c.c. of lymph being manufactured and 1,294,200 doses issued as compared with 1,215,330 during the previous year and exceeding all issues during the past three years. Besides the vaccinators of the Presidency lymph was supplied to Baroda, Kotah, Idar and Jhalwar States as well as to Kathiawar, Palanpur and Mahikantha Agencies. The increase in the total issues of lymph is largely due to increased demands from these States. Of the 1,294,200 doses issued 890,875 were reported to have been used. Of the remaining 400,000 doses over 200,000 were issued to Indian States, 128,000 to Civil Medical Officers and others and 23,000 to Military Medical Officers, the success rate for all primary operations being99.81 and for re-vaccinations 46.57. The high quality of
7 lymph for which the Institute has become noted was thus maintained. It is satisfactory to observe that the case success rate in the Indian States 99.58 is little less than that in the Presidency Districts. At the close of the year there was a balance of 31,067 c.c. or 621,340 doses of lymph on hand. No new processes were adopted in the preparation and purification of the lymph, reliance being placed on its occasional passage through rabbits to maintain the potency-; and on the chloroform process, which has given consistently good results in the past, for purification. Observations on the effect of keeping lymph for long periods in cold storage were continued during the year. Seed lymphs were obtained from Patwadangar, Lahore, Madras and Trivendrum, lymphs from Belgaum being sent in exchange.

Officer in charge of the Cantonment Hospital of which 107 were returned as successful giving a percentage of 83.72. The Compulsory Vaccination Act which was brought into force in Belgaum Cantonment from 15th May 1925 continued throughout the year. The work was in charge of the Cantonment Medical Officer who performed 235 primary and 49 re-vaccinations. 20. The practice of inoculation was detected in Labdarya and Thul talukas. In Labdarya taluka there was insufficient evidence on which to prosecute. In Thul taluka the vaccinator while performing work found some children inoculated by a Syad who absconded to Kalhat territory. A case was filed against 4 persons who had got their children inoculated by him. They were convicted under section 22 of the Vaccination Act I of 1892 and fined Rs. 15 each. Another inoculator also a Mahomedan was reported by the vaccinator of the same taluka to have inoculated several children. Papers together with the list of inoculated children submitted by the vaccinator have been forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner, Jacobabad.
11 21. No ill effects were reported to have occurred after vaccination during the year. 22. The Chief Engineer Lloyd Barrage and Canals Construction has arranged for vaccination in the townships and at the quarries to be performed by the Health Officer of the Barrage. 23. A diagram illustrating the proportion of population protected by vaccination during the seven years from 1st April 1921 to 31st March 1928 and the death rate from Small-pox for the year 1927-28 is given as Appendix III. General Remarks. 24. The Director, Vaccine Institute attended the Health and Baby week held at Poona in July 1927, where he demonstrated the processes of lymph preparation. A lecture on the subject was also given at the Seva Sadan. He also attended the Far Eastern Tropical Medical Congress at Calcutta. The Hon'ble Diwan Bahadur Harilal Desaibhai Desai, B.A., LL.B., Minister of Education paid a visit to the Vaccine Institute accom- panied by Mr. P. R. Chikodi, B.A., M.L.C., on 8th November 1927 and after inspecting the whole Institute expressed his appreciation of the work being done there. The Health Officers visiting this country from abroad under the auspices of the League of Nations inspected the Institute on February 12th, 1928. A training class for vaccinators was held from 1st July to 30th September 1927. There were in all 17 candidates in attendance out of whom 15 passed the final examination. Other persons trained at the Institute were Dr. Gopala Pillai, D.P.H., Superintendent of Triwen- drum Vaccine Institute, Mr. Javarkar, L.C.P.S., Medical Officer of Health, Dhulia Municipality and a vaccinator from Miraj Junior State Baby Week.APPENDICES
