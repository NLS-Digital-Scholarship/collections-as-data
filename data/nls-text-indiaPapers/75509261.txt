ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT IN INDIA FOR THE OFFICIAL YEAR 1906-1907. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Preface. The districts under the control of the Civil Veterinary Department are shown in light red on the Map which forms an enclosure to this report, and are the same as last year. With the exception of a few minor alterations, the Tables accompanying the report also remain unchanged. 2. Colonel J. W. A. Morgan was in charge of the Office of Inspector General, Civil Veterinary Department during the whole year, except for four months, when Major H. T. Pease officiated for him. Officers in charge. 3. The Table given below gives the names of the officers who held the several appointments in the Department during the year under report:2 Appointments. 1st April 1906. 31st March 1907. REMARKS.

Principal, Bengal Veterinary College. Captain A. S. Trydell ... Lieut.-Colonel F. Raymond Captain Trydell 1st3 the Agricultural Conference at Cawnpore. Proceeded to Bombay as a Member of the Arab Purchasing Committee in February 1907, and visited the Chharodi Cattle Farm to report on its future working and management. He travelled 13,251 miles by rail, 1,000 miles by steamer and 90 miles by road. 7. During the time Major Pease officiated as Inspector General, he inspect- ed the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory at Muktesar and the Rawalpindi4 physiology under one roof. Considerable additions have been made to the dog ward to allow of proper accommodation being provided for the admission of serious cases. In the contagious ward, six new segregation stalls have been provided and a large airy post-mortem house capable of being used for teaching purposes, is being erected. 18. In Bengal, of the buildings mentioned last year, the operation shed only has been completed but work at the various improvements sanctioned has re- cently been commenced. 19. It is most satisfactory to note the complete transformation which has been effected at the Bombay Veterinary College. The new buildings mentioned as having been sanctioned last year are being built and the students' quarters are nearly completed. Considerable additions have been made to the equip- ment. The museum has been commenced, all available material having been properly displayed and already very considerable additions have been made to them. The patho-bacteriological laboratory is being thoroughly well equipped and is now in working order and being made use of for diagnostic purposes. An operation theatre is to be erected. The pharmacy is being enlarged. The requirements still remaining, urgently required to place the institution on a proper footing, are an Infectious disease ward, Dissecting room and post-mor- tem room as well as a new Bacteriological Laboratory. 20. The establishment of small local research laboratories is a matter to which our attention has been directed. The Punjab and the Bengal Colleges now possess them and such work as is possible is carried out by officers in their spare time. Until, however, whole-time pathologists can be employed in them, we cannot hope for any very great progress to be made in research work. The number of officers available for work in Colleges is far too small, the Punjab be- ing the only one which has a whole-time teaching staff. Bombay comes next, but the extra work demanded of the small staff is far too great and I consider that the Principal should be made a whole time teacher and be relieved of the work in connection with the Glanders and Farcy Department and the Harbour In- spection work. The staff has been slightly strengthened in Bengal but there seems to be no whole-time officer working in the College and the same is true of Madras, where only one officer is available for the whole of the work of the Province. 21. It will be seen that considerable progress has been made in developing the resources of our Veterinary Colleges and placing them on a proper footing in regard to buildings and equipment. II.-TREATMENT OF DISEASE. Contagious dis- ease amongst solipeas. Outbreaks, mor- tality, etc. 22. Table II shows the reported mortality from the contagious diseases amongst animals named therein. The Army Remount Department, as usual, deals with all cases of contagious disease amongst equines occurring in the districts selected for horse-breeding under their Department and we have no record of them. 23. The same remarks as were made last year in regard to their accuracy apply this year. The figures, as a rule, relate only to cases which have been brought to the notice of the staff and do not in any way represent the total mortality from contagious diseases in our districts. 24. Glanders.5 Presidency. In the United Provinces, there were 14 outbreaks of the disease, cases occurring in Benares, Allahabad, Bijnor, Gonda and Dehra Dun, and 25 animals were destroyed. Two cases were destroyed in Karachi, one in the Central Provinces and one in Eastern Bengal and Assam. 25. Anthrax6 35. Serum inoculation against Anthrax was used in the United Provinces, Madras, Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam. Against Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia, in all but Burma, Bengal, Rajputana and Sind ; and against Black quarter in the United Provinces, Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province. 36. Rinderpest is reported to have accounted for 141,810 deaths against 137,233 last year. 37. Burma.7 44. Central Provinces 8 Other diseases 55. Table IV gives the number of animals treated and castrated by Veteri- nary Assistants on tour during the year. It appears from this that the 320 Veterinary Assistants visited 41,657 villages and treated 211,718 cases. This shows a falling off in the number of villages visited, but more animals were treated. The chief decrease shown in the number of villages visited is in the Punjab, but on the other hand more cases have been treated there, although one man less was employed. There is considerable progress in the North-West Frontier Province. 56. There was a marked increase in the number of animals castrated, 1,854 of which 911 were equines, against 1,385 last year. Veterinary Hospitals and Disper saries. 57. Table V gives the number of these institutions, the Veterinary Assis- tants employed and the number of animals treated as in and out-patients. There is a satisfactory increase in the number of hospitals and dispensaries working, 315 against 290 last year. Four new ones have been opened in each of the Pro- vinces of Punjab, Eastern Bengal and Assam, and Bombay, 3 each in the Cen- tral Provinces and Bengal, and 2 in the North-West Frontier Province. Mad- ras shows 4 more than last year and Burma 4 less. 58. The number of Veterinary Assistants employed in dispensaries is 317 against 308 last year, an increase of 9. 59. The total number of in and out-patients treated was 267,555 of which 83,922 were equines, 143,650 cattle and 39,983 other animals, a total increase of 1,858. There has been a steady increase all round excepting in the case of Eastern Bengal and Madras, in which latter province the decrease is shown as 42,528 cases. Last year's figures for Madras were incorrect. III.9 Bull-rearing and breeding Farms and De- pôts. 64. Table IX gives the main results of the working of the Provincial Cattle Farms. Details are given regarding the same five farms as were working last year, viz., Pusa and Siripur (Hathwa Raj) in Bengal, the Northcote Gowshalla at Chharodi in Bombay and the Telankheri and Powarkhera cattle- breeding farms in the Central Provinces. 65. Bengal.10 76. Table XII gives the average cost of feed, keep and attendance of horse, pony and donkey stallions. Fairs and Shows. 77. Table XIII gives the abstract particulars regarding Horse Fairs and Shows held in non-selected districts. Seventeen were held against 14 last year and nearly double the number of animals were present, viz., 35,242 against 18,685 last year. The number competing for prizes rose from 2,082 last year to 8,707 this, and Rs. 6,893 as well as 5 medals were awarded as prizes. A revised schedule and rules were drawn up by Captain Walker and sanctioned for Horse Shows in non-selected districts in the Punjab. 78. Table XIV gives the abstract particulars regarding Cattle Fairs and Shows. Altogether 73 were held during the year against 64 last year. The amount actually awarded in prizes was Rs. 25,887 and 61 medals out of a total of Rs. 37,701 available. The total number of stock present at the Fairs was 836,067 and the number competing for prizes was 11,077 cattle and 35 camels. The amount realized in fees was Rs. 136,989-11-6. It has been decided to discontinue the Imperial grant of Rs. 9,000 to Cattle Shows. IV. SUBORDINATE ESTABLISHMENT. Numbers supervision and work performed. 79. Table VII gives the strength of the subordinate establishment. There are at present 54 Veterinary Inspectors and 446 Veterinary Assistants employed in the whole of India, against 30 Inspectors and 417 Veterinary Assistants last year. This is a satisfactory increase considering the limited number of men available. In the Punjab good progress has been made, 6 Inspectors and 9 Veterinary Assistants having been added during the year. I am glad to say that the pay of these men has been increased in this Province and it has been decided to add 8 men a year to the cadre in future to provide a 2½ per cent. reserve for leave vacancies and training. The increase of the establishment of Veterinary Inspectors has allowed of their charges being made much smaller; their divisions now consist of 3 or 4 districts each. This has contributed to the efficiency of the Department considerably. The scheme is to post a Veteri- nary Assistant to each tahsil and an extra man to each district. The same plan is being adopted in the North-West Frontier Province. 80. The progress made in the United Provinces is also satisfactory, 4 Veterinary Inspectors and 15 Veterinary Assistants having been added to the staff. The pay has been slightly raised and should attract more men to join in the future. Great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining Veterinary Assistants during the year. In order to temporarily meet the difficulty, a scheme has been sanctioned for the deputation of a certain number of students annually to the Punjab and Bengal Veterinary Colleges as scholarship holders. Improvement has been made in other Provinces but it is slow. The work done by the subordinate Department generally is reported to be very good. PART B.-IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION. BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 81. Dr. Lingard has been in charge of the laboratory during the whole year and the staff has remained the same, with the exception that Mr. H. E. Cross has been appointed as Second Assistant Bacteriologist and joined late in the year. Mr. Goffi was appointed as third Laboratory Assistant and joined on the 15th October 1906. The. services of a Hospital Assistant have also been secured. 82. Work has, as usual, been carried out at Muktesar and Bareilly. Nume- rous important buildings have been completed, such as the Mallein and Tetanus laboratories and stables for Tetanus and Glandered horses. The machinery and engines are now all accommodated in one building, so that two engines and centrifuges are available and the risk of breakdown is greatly diminished; other necessary machinery is also being connected up. 83. The various matters connected with the working of the laboratory have been successfully administered during the year. Fodder, owing to the
11 increased number of animals kept, has been a difficulty but is being arranged for. The Forest reserve has been carefully managed. 84. Serum preparation.12 the serum during the year. The mortality after inoculation is only approxi- mate for the reason previously mentioned:13 90. Tetanus antitoxin.14 102. Herd bulls.15 117. Table XVIII shows the expenditure of the farm to have been Rs. 116,190 15-10, and the receipts Rs. 91,357-3-7, and the valuation of the stock, etc., at Rs. 264,850-4-6, against Rs. 125,251-11-0, Rs. 84,919-4-1, and Rs. 254,057-12-6 respectively, last year. This is a distinct all round improvement on last year's figures. Some years, however, must elapse before the heavy expenditure on improving lands, etc, can be reduced and receipt from the full outturn of stock, as laid down in the programme, can be worked up to. 118. Owing to the heavy weeding of the stock by the Committee which sat in December 1901, the outturn of Siege Train bullocks next year will be nil, but the year after and following years, the maximum should be reached. 119. Owing to the failure of the barani crops and hay harvest, the year has been a particularly trying one and I consider that Captain Farmer de- serves great credit for his excellent management of the farm and for the extraordinary improvement that is noticeable amongst all classes of stock.
