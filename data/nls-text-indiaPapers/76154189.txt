ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BENGAL, FOR THE TEAR 1896-97. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Calcutta: BENGAL SECRETARIAT PRESS. 1897.
Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bengal, for the year 1896-97. I TOOK over charge of the Bengal Civil Veterinary Department on the 12th October 1896. The Puja holidays were being held, and the Assistant Superintendent was on leave. 1. I was greatly pleased to find that the Bengal Veterinary Institution was established in such a fine building, the grounds so well laid out, and the whole establishment in such good order. To start a new thing and to bring it to an advanced degree of organization is not an easy task; I beg therefore to offer my congratulations to my predecessor, Veterinary Captain Gunn and those who worked with him, for the good work performed in this direction. 2. I have now to report what has been done during my term at Bel- gatchia. BENGAL VETERINARY INSTITUTION. 3. The Curriculum.( 2 ) they were taught. But Physiology is too difficult a science to go into to any great extent; moreover the time at our disposal is insufficient. In Rome respects I was not satisfied with the students. 1st, they were not as manly as they might be; 2nd, owing to their previous ignorance of animals, they were exceedingly awkward in handling them; 3rd, in clinical diagnosis they were weak; 4th, in diagnosing lameness they were bad, and 5th, some of them have been lazy. I shall try to remedy these defects. 12. The strong points of the students at Belgatchia, namely, their knowledge of English, intelligence, good caste, ability to write reports, are those that would qualify them for employment as senior veterinary assistants; but as they are weak in practical matters, I consider that an extra year of study is essential to fit them to gain the confidence of the people upon which such stress is very rightly laid in Government of India Resolution No. -1436/19-6, 1895. This view is shared by the Board of Examin- ers which sat at Belgatchia recently, and these gentlemen have recommended that the curriculum be extended by another year to meet the especial weak- ness of Bengali students. In considering this matter, we should not forget that a two years' course does not mean two years devoted to training, owing to the fact that about 230 days of the two years are taken up by vacations and holidays. 13. Having gained a reasonable knowledge of practical matters during the extra year's training, they would be as well prepared to occupy senior veterinary appointments in Bengal as the graduates of any other school. But I am most strongly of opinion that it would be a serious mistake to put inexperienced men, however high their qualifications, into senior appointments before they have learned the work of the junior grade and shown their value; for it does not follow that all men with high scholastic attainments are competent to supervise other men. I suggest, therefore, that all our graduates should start from the bottom and be promoted on their merits. 14. This subject has been fully discussed from the point of view of this Department in other communications. STIPENDS. 15. Fifteen Government stipends of Rs. 5 each per mensem were award- ed in Class B. Thirteen of these went to students who had been successful at the annual examination in March 1896, and two were given to two of the five men plucked in the final. In Class A, fourteen Government stipends of Rs. 5 each per mensem were awarded to students, as they only were consi- dered to bo deserving. One stipend was not awarded. (Appendix V.) 16. Stipends, other than Government stipends.( 3 ) Radha Krishto Nundy, from Balasore District Board, was irregular in attendance at lectures, &c., and was prevented from competing in the final. He is lazy and a great coward with animals. If he does not improve, he will have to be dismissed. 18. Reports as to the progress and conduct of students have been for- warded regularly to their respective authorities. 19. Sheo Bux Bogla Scholarship.( 4 ) high. The more patients we are able to show the students, the more know- ledge they will gain. It is of primary importance to have many cases for the students' clinical instruction. 28. I propose therefore that the scale of fees should be revised as follows:( 5 ) 38. Dissecting room.( 6 ) was 159 (Appendix XIV). Of these 139 were cured, 9 died, and in 11 cases the result was unknown; in other words, the owners either removed the animals or ceased to bring them for treatment. The Veterinary Assistant was sent to investigate one outbreak of rinderpest, and the figures given under this heading appear to refer to it. While on this work, he seems to have come across a case in which animals had been poisoned. 51. I am glad to be able to report that the veterinary dispensary is making its way. Mr. Russell wants me to get a first rate nalbund for his sub- division; unfortunately I have failed up to the present. 52. Patna.( 7 ) 62. A list of fairs is appended (Appendix XVIII), which shows certain addition. The Kochaikote fair, which is shown on the Inspector-General's list as a cattle fair, is not an animal fair at all in the ordinary sense, and appear to have been included by mistake. 63. Sonepur jair.( 8 ) (f) coloured brow-bands with rosettes might be issued to fix on the fore- heads of prize cattle; (g) owners of improved cattle to be approached with a view to sending their animals for show, not necessarily for sale or prizes, but in order to encourage the people. 75. I may add that I have since discovered, during visits to other fairs and shows, that there is scarcely one in which some of the above recommen- dations had not been adopted prior to my report. 76. Kalimpong.( 9 ) was detected during the Show. As this Show was so successful, it may be useful if I record somewhat in detail what was done, so as to assist any officer who may desire to encourage cattle improvements by similar means:( 10 ) 94. The cattle as a whole were not quite as good, nor in such good condition as those I saw at Sonepur; but I saw a few bullocks suited for ordnance work, and Captain Williams, I.C.D., purchased three very good ones for his department. There were plenty of good medium-sized bullocks. 95. Horses.( 11 ) 107. The failure of one donkey stallion should not cause discouragement, considering the importance of mules to the Military Department. I would suggest that this matter be persevered with until success does reward our efforts. 108. I am happy, therefore, to be able to report that the Inspector- General, Civil Veterinary Department, has consented to send another donkey stallion to Guntok, and the necessary conditions have been accepted by the Political Officer of Sikkim. 109. From the appended statement (Appendix XXVI) it will be seen that Rs. 71-8 only had been expended up to January 1896 for feed and keep of the stallion out of the Imperial grant of Rs. 250. No bill since that month has been received here. 110. It is proposed to attempt to further develop mule-breeding in Sikkim, and I hope to be able to find time to visit the district with this object. 111. I am glad to report that an attempt to introduce mule-breeding into Buxar has been sanctioned by the Inspector-General, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, and only awaits the approval of the Government of Bengal. Babu Har- dhyan Singh, Vice-Chairman of the Buxar Municipality, has undertaken to look after the donkey stallion. CATTLE BREEDING. 112. For some time I have been engaged in collecting data for a report upon cattle-breeding in these provinces, in accordance with a request from the Director of Land Records. A. full report is not yet ready for submission, but various short reports have been submitted of tours made in connection with this subject. 113. As a preliminary step in the inquiry, I have collected the history of every bull which, as far as I know, has been acquired through the agency of the Civil Veterinary Department or the Director of Land Records, and I give the result in Appendix XXVIA. 114. It will be seen that the largest percentage of successes belongs to Hissar bulls. 115. Speaking generally, the best draught cattle are to be found in Upper Bengal, where the best grazing is procurable. 116. The question of grazing areas is of vital importance in this province, and the Revenue Department is to be congratulated for not losing sight of this matter in settling Orissa. I am not aware if in Bengal there is any danger of the grazing grounds being encroached upon; but if any such danger exists, I hope, for the sake of our cattle, that these areas will be strictly protected. 117. In Upper Bengal there is a large cattle trade; dealers export the animals to the rest of the province, even as far as Mymensingh and Assam. Moreover, the Commissariat Department of the North Western Provinces sends officers to up-country fairs to purchase. 118. It has been said that the breed is deteriorating, and that fresh blood is needed. I have myself noticed that the legs and feet of a good many animals are not as good as they might be, and this applies particularly to the bigger bullocks. 119. I have conversed with many practical men, and they all say that Hansi and Hissar bulls are what they' want. 120. I think it may be safely admitted that, as regards breeding draught bullocks, neither the planters nor the raiyats in Upper Bengal have much to learn from anyone. 121. They know very well what is wanted to refresh the breed, but the difficulty is to get good bulls for the purposes. In the absence of good bulls, they have to make use of what they can procure locally. 122. Hansi and Hissar bulls are not easily procured. It took six months to obtain three bulls from Hissar for Sitamarhi district, and they have not given complete satisfaction owing to their not being considered big enough (58" and 59" only). 123. My predecessor formulated a very good scheme for supplying bulls in a cheap way to Bengal. He suggested that Brahmini bulls from up-country should be imported into Northern Bengal, and superfluous local Brahminis exported from there to the lower districts. The obvious danger of importing
( 12 ) Brahmini bulls has been indicated in a note by the Director of Land Records, viz., that only worthless brutes will be sent to us. The only way to meet this risk would be the adoption of a system of inspection and testing, which presents difficulties. Moreover, it has been found that the scheme has not worked very well in practice for various reasons: 1st, Captain Gunn has not been able to procure Dulls (for Dinajpur) in the North-West Provinces, because the local raiyats objected to part with their animals; 2nd, I have not succeeded in procuring Brahmini bulls at Sitamarhi for exportation to the Lower Provinces so far (but I intend to try again when the crops are beginning to grow); 3rd, those procured in my predecessor's time do not appear to have found universal favour. In whatever manner bulls are procured, it is evident that a considerable number are required, for, if the cattle of Bengal are deteriorating, a few bulls will scarcely stem the process, except in their immediate neighbourhood. More- over, the progeny of these bulls will tend to degenerate, though starting from a higher level. 124. I have now shown that good bulls are required and in numbers. I have shown that we cannot get them now. The remedy seems to be that Bengal should breed her own bulls, providing it can be proved to be remunerative when all things are considered. With this object in view, information is being col- lected and estimates prepared for submission to Government. 125. The Bankipore cross-bred cattle.( 13 ) 133. I append a synopsis of transactions in connection with cattle disease during the year under review; but it is open to serious doubt if the figures are even approximately correct (Appendix XXVIIA). 134. In studying this synopsis, it will be noticed that Circular No. 4Agri., dated 6th February 1895, of the Bengal Revenue Department, is not interpreted by all officers in the same way. It is, perhaps, more correct to say that the opinions of officers differ as to what is and what is not serious disease, for it will be seen that of 34 records in the synopsis, 21 were reported in the Calcutta Gazette in the first instance, and then applications had to be made from this office for information which in two or three cases remained unanswered. 135. I was able, except in one instance, to offer the services of a Veteri- nary Assistant whenever they appeared to be required. 136. A tabulated statement showing districts where outbreaks of cattle disease occurred during 1896-97 is appended (Appendix XXVIII) in the pre- scribed form. 137. Since 1882, when Mr. Finucane, the then Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, pointed out that the losses from cattle disease in Bengal amounted to a great deal more than eight lacs per annum, the subject has been steadily kept in view by Government, and my predecessor accumu- lated a good deal of useful information. We now have several Veterinary Assistants available to send into the districts. 138. As regards the laws bearing upon the subject of contagious cattle disease, I have been referred by the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal( 14 ) 145. On the other hand, the Commissioner of Police reported to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, that "provided the removal and treatment of cattle be carried out without cost to the owners, they will gladly avail themselves of the advantages that may be expected." 146. In connexion with the remarks of the Commissioner of Police, I suggested to the Director of Land Records and Agriculture, Bengal, (i) that a piece of land (which is available opposite the Bengal Veterinary Institution) be acquired as an isolation ground, and (2) that ambulances be procured to take sick animals there, so as to prevent possibility of their infecting others on the way, and (3) that animals be treated by my students (a most desirable arrangement for teaching purposes) and fed free of cost if an early report be made by the owner. 147. In practice, the cost would be small, considering the object to be attained. Bearing upon the suggestion of saving cost of keep to the owner, it may be remarked that compensation for slaughter is universal in Europe, as far as I know, and offers a precedent for providing cost of keep in this country, where slaughter is out of the question. 148. No doubt it would be possible to suggest very much more stringent methods, but I do not think they would have the slightest chance of being adopted. 149. The Director of Land Records has remarked that the land and am- bulance should bo provided by the Municipality. 150. Dr. Koch's inoculation in South Africa.( 15 ) means, such as periodical literature, of what was taking place in other countries or colonies in veterinary matters. I therefore drew up a list of papers which I considered would put us in touch with the rest of the world. 157. The Revenue Department at once sanctioned my application, and I hope soon to be in periodical receipt of the information required. 158. Fortunately, few cattle are imported into this country; at the same time the bubonic plague in Bombay and rinderpest in South Africa show that no country should be unprepared with machinery to meet emergencies. 159. Exportation of stock to Australia.( 16 ) THE STAFF 163. The Assistant Superintendent.APPENDIX I. LIST SHOWING THE NAMES, RESIDENCES, &c.,OF THE STUDENTS OF THE FIRST-YEAR CLASS. Serial No. NAMES.
