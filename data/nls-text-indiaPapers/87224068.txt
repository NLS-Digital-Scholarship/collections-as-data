The triennial report. 1. This, the triennial report on vaccination, covers the years 1893-94, 1894-95 and 1895-96, and the extent and results of the operations within the period are summarized in the following pages. Area of administration. 2. The whole of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, including the hill tracts of Naini Tal, Almora and Garhwál, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner, are included in the area of administration of operations of the Vaccina- tion Department, which also controls the operations in the Native State of Tehri- Garhwál. Rearrangement of circles of adminis- tration. 3. Up to the year 1896, the area of operations had been divided for the purposes of control into three circles, each in charge of a commissioned Medical Officer acting as Superintendent of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. From the 15th of February in this year, the number of these officers has been reduced to two, and the areas of control have been rearranged as below. The first circle consists of the Meerut, Agra, Rohilkhand and Allahabad Divisions, the district of Garhwál and the Native State of Tehri-Garhwál. The second circle consists of the Province of Oudh, the Benares and Gorakhpur Divisions, and the districts of Naini Tal and Almora. The officer in charge of the first circle is also Superintendent of the Pilgrim Hospitals in Garhwál. Constitution and strength of Vaccina- tion Department. 4. The Vaccination Department is under the control of the Sanitary Commission- er acting as Superintendent-General of Vaccination. The establishment now consists of two Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, forty-eight District Superintendents of Vaccination (the Civil Surgeons of districts), forty-nine Assistant Superintendents divided into three grades, and 888 vaccinators and probationers. The distribution is tabulated below:__ Circle. Superintendents of Circles (Deputy Sanitary Com- missioners). District Superin- tendents (Civil Surgeons). Assistant Super- intendents. Vaccinators (inclu- ding probationers and tube fillers). First grade. Second grade. Third grade.

( 2 ) Redistribution of Government vacci- nators. 5. This vaccination staff (888), however, is not confined to that supplied by Govern- ment, but includes municipal and town vaccinators as well as those maintained by public subscriptions. It was pointed out in the Review of the Report for last year that there were consider- able inequalities in the distribution of the staff supplied by Government. This is to some extent inevitable, since the opportunities of supplementing the regular staff by local efforts, vary in different districts, but the question has now been fully considered and a redistribution scheme sanctioned. When this has been carried out, it will remain for the district authorities to endeavour by local contributions to render the staff for the district as fully adequate to requirements as possible. Reorganization of Department. 6. During the triennial period to which this report refers, a very important change has been made in the organization of the Depart- ment, and from October 1893, Civil Surgeons have been placed in executive control of the vaccination staff in their districts, and now supervise and test the operations performed both in urban and rural areas. The only exceptions are in the seven districts of Allahabad, Benares, Lucknow, Agra, Bareilly, Cawnpore and Gorakhpur, and here the work in the principal cities is too constant and heavy to permit the Civil Surgeon leaving head-quarters for other than very short periods. In these districts Assistant Superintendents on higher pay are appointed to assist the Civil Surgeons in the supervision of the work of vaccination. This re- organization has removed the necessity of retaining the appointments of Deputy Superintendents of Vaccination, and these have been abolished and the Assistant Superintendents graded in three classes on different scales of pay. Vaccination oper- ations in the hill tracts, and the lymph collection operations, are still supervised by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. Result of re-organization scheme. 7. The result of the introduction of the scheme has been decidedly satisfactory and a large increase in the number of operations has been recorded. There is no doubt but that the local influence of the Civil Surgeon and his acquaintance with the people have largely contributed to this result, and it is satisfactory to know that these officers as a body regard the records as reliable and accurate. This I believe to be the case, but incessant vigilance will be necessary to prevent falsification of returns by lazy men in out-of- the-way localities. Such falsification has of late years rarely been found to take the form of entering fictitious cases, but rather of recording a higher ratio of success in the operations than was actually attained. Expenditure on vaccination. 8. The total expenditure on vaccination in 1895-96 was Rs. 1,47,963-5-2 as compared with Rs. 1,55,786-2-2 in the year 1894-95, shewing a reduction of Rs. 7,822-13-0. But this large decrease is more apparent than real, and is principally explained by the fact of the travelling allowances for District Superintendents of Vaccination having been in past years shown in the Vaccination Report. As, however, this item is debited to the Medical Department, it is omitted in the report now submitted. Nevertheless there is a re- duction, and this, in view of the increase in the outturn of work, is satisfactory. In the following tables are given the sources of disbursement, the heads of expen- diture, and the items in which increase or decrease of the same have occurred :( 3 ) Heads of expenditure. Year.

The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was anna 1 pies 9, as compared with anna 1 pies 11 in the preceding year. Under orders, Statement No. II is now prepared in a form which shows the pay and expenses of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices, separately, and if these latter items be deducted, the cost of each successful case of vaccination stands at anna 1 pies 4. Since the pay of commissioned officers varies with their seniority, the last figures probably give the better indication as to the real cost of the operations. General operations. 10. As compared with the year 1894-95, the returns of work are distinctly satis- factory. The following table will show the com- parative results clearly:( 4 ) Vaccination in municipalities. of interest on the part of vaccinators, and hostility to the operation on the part of the people. In Etah the explanation furnished is that there is a deficiency of children over one year of age available for vaccination. The causes assigned for the decrease in the last three districts are too general to be altogether satisfactory, and more energy appears to be required to encourage vaccination in these localities. 11. Upon the whole, this was very fairly satisfactory. There was an increase of 4,882 primary successful vaccinations in the year under report as compared with the previous year. Out of 103 municipalities 60 showed an increase and 42 a decrease. But in many instances the increase or decrease was nominal. Lucknow with an increase of 3,370, Mirzapur-Bindhachal with 869, Koil (Aligarh) with 688, Farukhabad-Fatehgarh with 563, and Cawnpore with 525, all show satisfactory progress. The greatest fallings off are in Bareilly (1,372), Fyzabad-Ajudhya (874),Tanda(606), and Azamgarh (558). In Bareilly the decrease was due to the reduction of the staff. In Fyzabad- Ajudhya and Tanda, the District Superintendent states that the decrease is more apparent than real; work performed without municipal limits having in past years been included in municipal returns. In Azamgarh the District Superintendent explains that the decrease was inevitable and anticipated, inasmuch as the municipality was first brought under the Vaccination Act in 1894, and consequently a very large number of children were vaccinated during the season 1894-95 who had escaped the operation in former years. The standard was therefore not likely to be worked up to in future. The figures given shew this to be correct. Diagrams accompanying report. 12. A diagram illustrating the death-rate from small-pox in these Provinces, for a series of years, and another showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district during the past season, are attached.

The data furnished by the second table are by far the most important, and it will be seen that, with four exceptions, every district showed a substantial improvement. The small decreases in the districts of Dehra Dun and Almora and in the Tehri State are not very important, as vaccination in these hill tracts is very popular and the areas are probably as well protected as England. The deficiency in Almora is also largely explained by the fact that, up to 1890-91, the returns of the Bhabar were included in those of this district. The only serious falling off therefore is seen to be in Sultánpur. The explanation of this is that in 1890-91 and 1891-92 a great impetus was given to vac- cination by certain district officers who entertained a considerable staff of extra men and encouraged operations with exceptional zeal. In 1892-93 and subsequent years the staff was reduced to its normal number, and a consequent decrease in the outturn of work occurred.
( 12 ) Increase in the proportion of persons protected per 1,000 of population in the last triennial period. 14. The following table gives the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in the two triennial periods. It will be seen that the proportion rose from 19.64 to 26.89, or an increase of 7.25 :( 13 ) of little value. A dishonest vaccinator will always arrange that unsuccessful cases, entered as successful, should not be present at the inspection. Ascertaining the result of the operation in such absentees usually involves a visit to the house of the parents, very likely at some distance, and a good deal of time is spent in so doing. The official anxious to show a large number of inspections usually takes the vaccinator's word as to the result, and hurries on to another village. In my experience the condi- tion and quality of vaccination in a district by no means generally correspond with the apparent zeal and industry of the Assistant Superintendent as shown by returns. It will be noted that the percentage of success observed by superior officers of the Department this year was greater than that claimed by the vaccinators, and this fact points, primâ focie, to the probability of the general accuracy of the records. The supply of lymph. 18. The supply of lymph from the hills was good and the work was started satis- factorily in the plains on due date. In the 2nd Circle the collection of lymph and its despatch to the plains com- menced earlier than usual and all districts were supplied by the 21st of August. But the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner reports that this supply was almost altogether inert, and he considers that the lymph had become sterilized by the heat in the valleys on its passage to the plains. This is doubtless correct. He however kept up continuous supplies until vaccination was properly started in all districts. He considers that it will be sufficiently early if the lymph reaches the plains by the 15th of September, and in this view I concur. The unusual prevalence of small-pox in the provinces in the spring threw a good deal of extra work on the Department in the matter of supplying fresh lymph in tubes to cantonments and other localities where the disease had broken out. In anticipa- tion however of this demand continuing after the regular operations had ceased in the plains, arrangements were made for lymph to be regularly collected in the hills and despatched to all applicants. The plan proved of service, and some 1,200 tubes were sent out. The following is a list of the applicants who were supplied with lymph during the season 1895-96:( 14 ) Scheme for extending operations with animal lymph. 19. A scheme is at present under consideration for extending the operations of the bovine lymph depôt at Lucknow during the cold season, and for establishing a similar depôt in the hills from which lymph can be despatched to applicants during the recess season, and from which also the material necessary for establishing the vesicle throughout the Provinces in September can be sent. Such an institution has long been a desideratum in these Provinces. With the exception of the one at Lucknow, none of the local depôts can be said to have worked altogether satis- factorily. A certain amount of animal lymph has been cultivated and used in the head- quarters' station with success, but it has proved of little efficacy if not used immediate- ly. The fact is that the matter is one requiring the supervision of an expert, with adequate time and means at his disposal. Period during which operations are performed in the plains. 20. For the last three years, efforts Lave been made to carry on vaccination in the plains throughout the year. The system has always been unpopular, not only with the people and the vaccinators, but also with the authorities who had the best opportunity of watch- ing the results. As a matter of fact not much was ever done, as compulsion was il- legal in municipalities and vaccination optional in the district. In the Government review of the Report of last year it was ordered that the matter should be given care- ful consideration and Civil Surgeons consulted. These officers and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were practically unanimous on the point. They stated that during the hot weather and rains foul sloughing sores often followed the operations, that the system was arousing hostility in localities where the people had begun to accept vacci- nation, and finally, that the lymph when taken from the vesicles was very commonly either purulent or inactive. It is now ordered that hot weather vaccination operations shall only be carried on when small-pox is present in any district in an epidemic form. Small-pox during the past season. 21. After much immunity from small-pox for several years, this disease- appeared in these provinces in an epidemic form in the autumn of 1895 and spring of 1896. There were 53 deaths in October, 114 in November, 312 in December 1895, 710 in January, 1,284 in February and 2,869 in March 1896. The districts which suffered most severely were Jalaun, Jhánsi, Agra, Unao, Bareilly, Allahabad, Cawnpore, Benares, Aligarh, Pilibhít, Muttra, Bulandshahr, Etáwah and Bahraich, all of which showed a death-rate from this cause of over .1 per mille, ranging from .78 in Jalaun to .10 in Bahraich. This death-rate by no means represents the actual incidence of the disease, since many cases occurred ending in re- covery, for one case which terminated fatally. There are no records to show what numbers were actually attacked and recovered, but from inquiry and investigation, it appears clear that the epidemic was very widespread. In well vaccinated localities, numerous cases occurred in protected people who, while a source of danger to others, passed through the disease with little difficulty or risk. I have examined many of these cases occurring in adults who had been efficiently vaccinated as children, and the symptoms were often so slight as to be only recognized on close inspection. They served, however, just as efficiently as severe cases, to spread the disease( 15 ) of each reported case were provided with instructions in vernacular as to the best me thods of disinfecting the dwelling, &c. The working of the Vaccination Act. 22. The Vaccination Act is in force in all Municipalities. It is not worked as efficiently as it should be. I have frequently found that register. No. 2 is not understood, and that children who have escaped vaccination in the past year are not brought on to this record. In the Annual Sanitary Report for 1895 it is pointed out that birth registers in Municipalities are defective, a large number of towns showing, in a healthy year, an excess of deaths over births. Vaccination Register No. I, under the Act, is practically a copy of this birth register. Again, it is ordered that these vacci- nation registers should be kept up by the municipality, but not unfrequently the duty devolves on the vaccinator instead of on a Municipal clerk. Unless these registers are complete and accurate, vaccination in any municipality will never be thorough, and the population satisfactorily protected. A circular calling attention to the necessity of more care being exercised in this respect has been issued, and it is hoped that the matter will receive more attention in future It appears, from the reports of the District Superintendents of Vaccination, to have been necessary to issue summonses under the Act in 3,185 cases. The results are not always given, but it appears that in almost all instances the issue of the summons was sufficient, for the parents consented to the operation being performed and no further action was necessary.

Dated Naini Tal, the 28th October 1896. READ( 2 ) doubled. The ratio of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of the population has risen from 13.77 in 1886-87 to 27.71 in 1895-96. The mortality from small-pox during the period has varied from 1.26 per mille in 1890 to .04 per mille in 1895. The latter ratio is the lowest on record in these provinces. It is impossible to expect that the complete immunity from small-pox which the provinces enjoyed in 1895 will continue, as the disease has its- periods of advance and retrogression, a large proportion of the population is in most districts still unprotected, and in no district are revaccinations, by which alone is protection made really effective, numerous. But, from the instructive diagram illustrating the small- pox death rate for each year from 1876 to 1895 which faces page 4 of the report, it may be reasonably inferred that such epidemics as occurred in 1878 and 1883-84, when the deaths amounted to 45 per mille of the total population of the provinces, are things of the past. Turning to the district figures in the table in para- graph 12, the great- est progress is ob- servable in Oudh. In 1885-86 vacci- nation in that Pro- vince was very backward. In 1890-91 popular prejudices had been overcome in two or three of the 12 Oudh districts, but the Province as a whole was in this matter, very far behind the North-Western Provinces. A marked improvement has now taken place, and in the Lucknow Division the ratio of successful vaccinations to the total population considerably exceeds the provincial ratio and is in excess of the birth rate. In the Fyzabad Division there is room for fur- ther improvement, especially in Sultánpur, Bahraich, and Gonda. Outside Oudh the districts in which vaccination is most backward are the three districts of the Gorakhpur Division, the five districts of the Benares Division, and the two districts of Allahabad and Jhánsi. The divi- sion where it is best established is that of Meerut. In Go- rakhpur and Basti, after some improve- ment, matters have again slipped back and the ratio of persons vaccinated is much below the birth rate. In District.

( 3 ) Azamgarh it is also much below the birth rate. In the Benares Division there has been considerable improvement, but there is room for more. In the important district of Allahabad the figures are very- unsatisfactory, and the attention of the District Board will be directed to the matter. In this district the number of persons vaccinated per vaccinator in 1895-96 was only 1,248 against the provincial average of 1,753, so that there is no excuse on the ground of an insufficient staff. In some of the Oudh districts and some districts in the Gorakhpur and Benares Divisions the work done by each vaccinator compares favour- ably with the provincial average, and as vaccination becomes more popular some increase in the staff in these densely crowded districts may have to be provided by district boards.

The ultimate aim of the Department is to secure the vaccina- tion of every child in the provinces within twelve months of its birth. To secure this the number of children annually vaccinated should not be less than 80 per cent. of the births of the year, the difference roughly representing infantile mortality. The figures given in paragraph 16 of the report show that in 1895-96 the number of successful primary vaccinations was 79.76* per cent. of the total births. This is a closer approximation to the birth rate than has ever before been attained. But it must be noted, in partial explanation of this satisfactory result, that the birth rate in 1895, on account of causes which have been discussed in the Sanitation Report for the year, was very much lower than that for the two preceding years. It has also to be noted that, owing to the leeway which the Department has still to make up in parts of the Province, notably in the 2nd Circle, only 43 per cent. of the persons vaccinated were children born during the year. The distinction between the two circles in this respect is very remarkable. In the 1st Circle, in most districts of which vaccination has long been thoroughly established, few of the adult population are unvaccinated, and infantile vaccination is the rule. In the 2nd Circle infantile vaccination is the exception, and vaccination of children over the age of one year and of adults is the rule. The future progress of the Department in the 2nd Circle will be gauged to a great extent by the increase in infantile vaccination. 5. No change was made during the triennial period in the method of supplying lymph to the districts for starting vaccination in the beginning of the cold season. Lymph was, as usual, collected during the rains in the higher hills of Kumaun by a special staff of vaccinators and despatched to the plains in September and October. * The percentage 73.74 shown in column 5 of the table in paragraph 16 against the 1st Circle for the year 1893-94 is incorrect. The correct figures are 43.74.
( 4 ) Animal lymph was used to supplement this supply in a few places where local depôts are established, but it loses its efficacy in a few days unless it is preserved in a special medium under skilled supervision. The Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner hopes to be able to give effect to a scheme submitted by the Superintendent-General for establishing a central depôt in the hills for the preparation of bovine lymph in a form suitable for transport to the plains. Should this succeed, the present special arrangements for the collection of human lymph in the hot weather and the rains by carrying on vaccination operations in the hills may by degrees be dispensed with.

Municipal vaccination shows an improvement in the year under report, the ratio of successful vaccinations per mille of the popu- lation within municipal limits being 38.15 against 34.92 in 1894-95. In the muni- cipalities mentioned in the margin the ratio is low, and in them the provisions of the Vaccination Act require to be more effec- tively enforced. The remarks in paragraph 22 of the report as to the common practice of omitting to bring the names of children who have escaped vaccination in one year on Register No. 2, and as to defective birth registration in many municipalities, notably in Allahabad and Bareilly, will be brought to the notice of the chairmen of municipal boards. The average number of persons vaccinated by each municipal vaccinator within municipal limits was only 957. As 2,000 vaccinations is not an excessive outturn of work for a vaccinator, municipal vaccinators have, as a rule, ample time for working in rural areas bordering on municipal limits. In the Government orders on the report for 1894-95 the short-sighted policy of some municipalities in refusing to allow their vaccinators to per- form work beyond municipal limits was noticed. The figures given above show that such work may be permitted without detriment to the needs of the municipality. 7. The services of the gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 23 of the report as having given special assistance to vaccination during the year will be separately acknowledged. The acknowledgments of the Government are due to Surgeon-Major Thomson, Sanitary Commis- sioner and Superintendent-General of Vaccination, for his clear and interesting report, and to him and to the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners for the care with which they have supervised the operations of the Department. The report omits to mention the names of District Magis- trates and Civil Surgeons to whom the Department was most indebted for aid during the year. This omission should be corrected in future reports. ORDER.( 5 ) Ordered also that a copy, with a copy of the Report, be forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department, for the information of His Excellency the Governor-General in Council.

For ANNUAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES AND OUDH, FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. The report for 1896-97. 1. The triennial report on vaccination for the years 1893-94, 1894-95, and 1895-96 was submitted last year. The remarks for the year 1896-97 are therefore brief in character. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. 2. In the following table are shown the constitution and strength of the Depart- ment during the year under report. The distri- bution of vaccinators differs somewhat from that during last year in consequence of the application of the scheme for the more even distribution of Government vaccinators with regard to population. There were eight more men employed than during the previous season :( 2 ) Decrease in expenditure during 1896-97 as compared with that of 1895-96. Decrease. Increase. Total decrease.

The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna eight pies as compared with one anna nine pies in the previous year. If the pay and expenses of com- missioned officers and their offices be deducted, however, the cost is about the same as that in last year. General operations. 5. The following table shows the amount of work done in the current year as compared with that in the one preceding. There was a small increase in the total number of vaccina- tions, and also in successful primary operations. The average number performed by each vaccinator was slightly less. The percentage of success was about the same. There was a large increase in the number of successful revaccinations. 1895-96. 1896-97.

There were several important reasons why the work during the last season should have been less than usual. In the first place, operations ceased fifteen days earlier than in past years, in accordance with Govern- ment orders on the subject. Again a very considerable number of vaccinators were employed in connection with cholera on relief works and on plague operations, and, finally, on account of the distress in certain tracts, the number of children who were fit subjects for vaccination was necessarily very much reduced. That instead of a falling off, therefore, there was a slight increase in the work must, it is sub- mitted, be regarded as satisfactory. As regards the districts separately, a mere comparison of the returns with those of last year would be misleading. The redistribution scheme has now been completed and, the strength of the vaccination staff in many districts has been considerably altered. Other conditions already mentioned must also be considered. It appears, however, that in certain districts, more energy and zeal are still required, and the Assistant Superintendents of such localities will be replaced by more capable men. The returns for Garhwal show a great falling off, and the official responsible for this will be called upon for an explanation. Outside the hill tracts seven districts, viz. Bulandshahr, Bareilly, Pilibhít, Unao, Sitapur, Hardoi and Rae Bareli showed an aver- age of over 2,000 operations per vaccinator, which is a good tale of work. Neverthe- less in all these districts, except Bareilly, there was a decrease in the total number of vaccinations performed. In paragraph 3 of the Government review on the report for 1895-96, attention was called to the condition of vaccination in certain divisions, viz., Lucknow, Fyz- abad, Gorakhpur, Benares and Allahabad. As regards the Lucknow division, in all districts except Kheri, the degree of protection has fallen off;( 3 ) A considerable increase in the number of infants vaccinated is noticeable in the 2nd Circle. Vaccination in municipalities. 6. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population in municipalities was 38.55 as compared with 28.87 for the whole of the Provinces. Exclusive of hill stations, the municipalities best protected were Sultánpur, Gonda, Balrámpur and Sambhal. The worst were Jaunpur, Allahabad and Jhánsi. The statistics suffi- ciently indicate the very varying degrees of interest taken in the matter by local authorities. Diagrams accompanying report. 7. A diagram illustrating the deaths from small-pox in these Provinces for a series of years, and another showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district during the past season, are attached.

Conduct of officials. 13. The conduct of officials was reported generally to be good. Constant vigilance, however, is necessary on the part of inspecting officers to ensure a trustworthy and accurate record of operations being maintained, and to keep lazy and dishonest vaccinators up to their work. Delay in appearance of report. 14. The report was delayed by the non-receipt of the returns from the Saháran- pur district, which is to some extent explained by the fact that most of the vaccinators were employed on plague operations at Hardwar. This is not altogether satisfactory, however, and certain offenders have been fined. S. J. THOMSON, D. P. H. CAMB,.

No. 614/XVI( 2 ) Allahabad, 1.90 ; Bareilly, 1.85 ; Koil, 1.72; Cawnpore, 1.60 ; Jaunpur, 1.56: and His Honor again notices, with regret, that the provisions of the Vaccination Act (No. XIII of 1880) are not strictly enforced. In Allahabad, for instance, with 5,165 births, only 2,453 children under one year were successfully vaccinated. The defective vaccination in the Allahabad district and in the Allahabad and other municipalities was pressed on the attention of the Boards concerned in the review of your report for 1895-96. Though the character of the year may account for absence of improvement in rural tracts, the towns were less affected by it, so far as the actual work of vaccination was concerned. The Civil Surgeons, however, who are Superintendents of Vaccination in municipalities, were in many cases fully occupied with other important duties. With the abatement of famine the Lieutenant-Gov- ernor and Chief Commissioner expects Superintendents of Vaccination to address themselves more particularly to the administration of sections 17 and 18 of the Act.

The triennial report having been submitted in 1896, the remarks for the year 1897-98, like those for 1896-97, are brief in character. A full report will be submitted next year. Vaccination work during the last season was carried on under circumstances fortunately quite exceptional. The severe famine had rendered a large proportion of children unfit subjects for the operation, and it was considered altogether inexpedient to urge vaccination in cases where it might be followed by unfavourable consequen- ces. The operation is still viewed with distrust by a considerable proportion of the population, and mischief might easily have been caused by indiscreet zeal. Constitution and strength of the Vaccination Department. 2. In the following table are shown the constitution and strength of the department during the year under report. The duties of District Superintendents of Vaccination in the hill tracts are performed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, so that out of the 48 District Superintendents of Vaccination given in the subjoined list, only 46 are Civil Surgeons:( 2 ) Heads of expenditure.

The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna eight pies; i.e. exactly the same as that in the previous year. General operations. 5. The following table shows the amount of work done in the year under report, as compared with that in the one preced- ing:( 3 ) Vaccination in municipalities. 6. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population in the municipalities was 32.51 as compared with 38.55 in the previous year, and 25.97 for the whole of the Provinces. The explanations of this falling off are the same as in the case of districts as a whole. The municipalities best protected were Sambhal (71.11), Sultánpur (66.28), Sitapur (61.11), Khairabad (59.97), Gonda (57.29), Lakhimpur (54.25), Bahraich (54.06), Sahaswan (51.98) and Amroha (50.75). The least protected municipalities were Hardwár Union (9.58), Jalesar (16.84), Brindaban (17.18), Kalpi (17.38), Sikandra Rao (18.58), Pilibhít (18.43), Mau Rani- pur (19.36). Special circumstances (i. e. prevalence of plague) existed in the Hardwár Union Municipality. Brindaban is a pilgrim resort. Diagrams accompanying report. 7. A diagram illustrating the deaths from small-pox in these Provinces for a series of years, and another showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the pro- portion of population protected by vaccination in each district during the past season, are attached.

( 14 ) Conduct of officials. 14. The conduct of the officials has been upon the whole satisfactory, although constant vigilance is necessary to ensure a trustworthy record of work being maintained. The steady progress in vaccination, which has characterized these Provinces for many years, has in the past season been arrested, but this has been due to circumstances and conditions exceptional in nature, and altogether beyond control.

The epidemic, which was widespread in character, was most severe in the districts mar- ginally noted. It is noticeable that the rural circles of the Sul- tánpur district, where the death rate was the highest, have shown for some years past a very low percentage of vaccinations. Jaunpur is also badly protected. The returns of persons successfully vaccinated in the rural circles of the Allahabad and Bánda districts are the lowest in the provinces (16.20 and 16.45 respectively), while the death rate from small-pox was high. The poor results are doubtless due in a great measure to the famine prevalent in these localities: with the return of normal conditions the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Com- missioner hopes that there will be a substantial improvement observ- able. The matter deserves the serious attention of the District Boards concerned. 4. Among municipalities the death rate from small-pox was highest at Nagina, 8.31 per mille, Ujhani, 4.58; Bela, 3.55; Nawábganj, 3.15 ; and Najibabad, 2.37. Municipal vaccination shows a falling off from 38.55, the ratio of successful vaccinations per mille of the popula- tion in 1896, to 32.51 in 1897. Many of the towns are very indiffer- ently protected, for which the special circumstances of the year may be accepted as an explanation. Superintendents, however, should be reminded of the orders passed on your report for 1896-97 to the effect that the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner expects them to address themselves to the proper administration of the Vaccination Act, especially of sections 17 and 18. 5. In conclusion, I am to ask that the acknowledgments of Government may be conveyed to the gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 12 of your report as having rendered especial assistance to the Depart- ment during the year. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, W. H. L. IMPEY, Secy. to Govt., N.-W. P. and Oudh.

Page. Column. ForANNUAL REPORT on VACCINATION in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for the year 1898-99. The triennial report. 1. THIS, the triennial report of vaccination, covers the years 1896-97, 1897-98, and 1898-99; as, however, annual reports have already been submitted for the two previous years, the present report specially deals with the work of the latter year. Area of administration. 2. No change has taken place in the area during the three-year period under report. Constitution and strength of Vaccina- tion Department. 3. In the following table are shown the constitution and strength of the Department during the year 1898-99 :( 2 ) the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners; elsewhere the Civil Surgeons are specially concerned in supervision. The results of this re-organization scheme continued to be satisfactory ; but the exceptional conditions of the two first years of this triennial period preclude a useful comparison with the results of the preceding triennial period. Expenditure on vaccination. 6. The total expenditure on vaccination was( 3 ) to 1,269,037 in 1898-99. In these comparisons the pay of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices is excluded, for the reason that these payments vary with the seniority of these officers, and both the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices are very largely employed on work in connection with sanitation. General operations. 8. The following table shows the comparative results during the three years under review :( 4 ) high ; in Fyzabad the extra vaccinators commenced work about the middle of November, and little or no assistance is reported to have been rendered by the district officers; in Ballia ridiculous rumours as to plague inoculations were circulated, and vaccination was confused with these inoculations ; in Lucknow, although there is a decrease, the number of persons protected per 1,000 is much above the provincial rate and is satisfactory ; in Gházipur, the work, though showing a decrease, is the same as the provincial average ; in Azamgarh and in Benares the false work of last year of two vaccinators in each district was discovered and the vaccinators dismissed; in Unao three vaccinators were ill, and but little assistance was said to have been received from the Revenue Department. The total number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population follows the same course in the years under review as that mentioned above. The number of successful operations performed is obviously of greater import- ance than the total number of operations performed, from the point of view of value in protective results, and the year 1898-99 shows an increase of 44,708 successful operations over the successful operations of the preceding year. The number of revaccinations in 1898-99 is practically the same as in 1897-98, despite the fact that, in the latter year, many revaccinations were due to the presence of small-pox. The percentage of success in primary cases in which the result was known is satisfactory in the three years. Prevalence of small-pox in 1896 and 1897. 9. Small-pox was prevalent in these Provinces during both 1896 and 1897, and in many districts the periods of performing operations were prolonged into the hot weathers of those years in order to combat the disease. The incidence of the disease in 1896 was heaviest in Allahabad district, death-rate from small-pox 4.10, proportion of population protected by vaccination in 1896-97 19.77; in Unao district, death-rate from small-pox 3.85, proportion of population protected by vaccination 26.97 ; and in Bareilly district, death-rate from small-pox 2.39, proportion of population protected by vaccination 30.85; the provincial death- rate from small-pox for the year was .91, and the provincial proportion of popula- tion protected by vaccination during the preceding five years was 23.92. In 1897 the incidence of small-pox was heaviest in Sultánpur district, death-rate from small-pox 5.98, proportion of population protected by vaccination in 1897-98 20.76; in Jaunpur district, death-rate from small-pox 5.57, proportion of population protected by vaccination 21.47 ; in Bijnor district, death-rate from small-pox 5.32, pro- portion of population protected by vaccination 21.96 ; in Budaun district, death-rate from small-pox 4.80, proportion of population protected by vaccination 30.54; in Partábgarh district, death-rate from small-pox 4.67, proportion of population pro- tected by vaccination 24.42; in Rae Bareli district, death-rate from small-pox 4.59, proportion of population protected by vaccination 22.70 ; in Hardoi district, death- rate from small-pox 4.42, proportion of population protected by vaccination 39.86; in Mirzapur district, death-rate from small-pox 4.40, proportion of population pro- tected by vaccination 30.05 ; in Gonda district, death-rate from small-pox 3.76, proportion of population protected by vaccination 29.30 ; in Shájahsápur district, death-rate from small-pox 2.94, proportion of population protected by vaccination 21.93 ; the provincial death-rate from small-pox for the year was 1.86, and the pro- vincial proportion of population protected by vaccination during the preceding five years was 25.93.

For this result famine and measures in connection with plague prevention are, in my opinion, responsible. During this triennial period an exceptionally high death-rate( 12 ) The famine during 1896 and 1897 caused a very large infant mortality, so that the balance of unprotected children in the succeeding year was much smaller than is usual. It is satisfactory to note that there was during 1898-99 a large increase in the number of children under one year of age protected by successful operation, in comparison with the figures of the two preceding years. The figures are( 13 ) It will be seen that in Bijnor, Fatehpur, Bánda, Allahabad, Hamírpur, Jalaun, Naini Tál, Lucknow, Fyzabad, Bara Banki and Jaunpur the vaccinators have a smaller population to operate on than is calculated to give them a good percentage of work. In many of these districts however, notably in Fatehpur, Bánda, Allahabad and Hamírpur, the hostility of the people to vaccination is still considerable, and I do not advocate therefore any reduction in this excess of vaccinators as computed merely on the population, and not on the important additional factor of the attitude of the people towards vaccination. In Dehra Dún, Naini Tál, Lucknow and Fyzabad districts, although the number of operations per vaccinator is low, owing to the excess of vaccinators, yet the districts are well vaccinated. In Bara Banki district no less than 10 vaccinators are extra men temporarily engaged at the expense of the Court of Wards, and these men, knowing that their appointments are temporary, are indifferent as regards the amount of work done. In Jaunpur and in Bijnor dis- tricts the vaccinators were indifferent to their work, and three and eight men were punished respectively. In Jhánsi and in Hamírpur districts, there is an increase in work as compared with last year, but the work done is still greatly deficient. In Jalaun district one vaccinator was pensioned, one was on sick leave, one was deputed on plague duty, and two were ill for over six weeks ; in all these cases work was carried on by locally entertained (untrained) men. Vaccination in proportion to births. 15. The following table shows the total number of persons vaccinated, and the number of successful primary vaccinations in pro- portion to births for the last eight years. The results are shown by circles :( 14 ) The 1st circle continues to show during 1898-99 much better results, as regards the vaccination of children under one year of age, than the second circle. Although the number of successful primary operations was greater in 1898-99 than in 1897-98, yet the higher birth-rate in the former year gives a resulting pro- portion of protected children lower than that of 1897-98. General results of inspection. 16. District Superintendents of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioners tested 129,403 cases or 9.25 per cent., and Assistant Superintendents and other inspecting offi- cers 411,165 cases, or 29.40 per cent. of the total operations. Owing to the presence of plague in the Provinces the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was unable to visit the hill tracts ; vaccination there proceeds with facility, as the people generally appreciate the protection thereby afforded ; nevertheless the important work of lymph collection should be supervised to ensure that the high standard of lymph hitherto supplied to the Proviaces be maintained. The employment of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 1st Circle, on duties in connection with the sanitation of the large fairs at Allahabad and Hardwar occupied much of the time previously spent in the inspection of vaccination in the districts where Civil Surgeons have no time for inspection-tours. The quality of inspection-work by Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination is of far greater importance than the quantity ; thorough investigation into every doubtful case met with will ensure far greater honesty on the part of a vaccinator than a superficial inspection of many cases. The time occupied in investigating one case thoroughly in which there is an endeavour to conceal a wrong result or a fabrication will suffice for the inspection of many cases cursorily. I do not therefore attach the same importance to the returns giving the number of inspections performed, as to the manner in which the vaccinators work in a district, for the latter fact gives a truer indication of the qualities of an Assistant Superintendent. The percentage of success as returned by the vaccinators is very slightly in. excess of that observed by inspecting officers. Supply of lymph. 17. The supply of lymph from Garhwál was excellent, and work was started satisfactorily in the plains on the due date. The lymph supplied from Tehri-Garhwál was very indifferent, and many tubes were rejected and destroyed by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner ; the tube-filler was incompetent and has been dismissed from his post. The supply of lymph from the Almora district to commence work in the plains was of good quality. The despatch of lymph to the various districts in the plains commenced in the second week in September. The following is a list of the applicants other than District Superintendents, who were supplied with lymph during 1898-99:( 15 ) 18. Medical Officer in charge, 8th Bengal Cavalry Hospital, Bareilly. 19. Medical Officer in charge, 3rd Bengal Infantry Hospital, Allahabad. 20. Medical Officer in charge, Station Hospital, Sháahjaháanpur. 21. Medical Officer in charge, Station Hospital, Muttra. 22. Medical Officer in charge, 6th Bengal Light Infantry Hospital, Meerut. 23. Medical Officer in charge, Station Hospital, Bareilly. Working of bovine lymph depôts. 18. The bovine lymph depôt at Lucknow is reported to have supplied lymph of good quality ; the operations are however chiefly in the city concerned ; calf lymph in tubes, unmixed with any preservative, has not good keeping qualities in this climate, and there is no antipathy among the people to the use of human lymph, although there is objection among a very small number to the withdrawal of lymph from the vesicle. The bovine lymph depôt at Allahabad was visited by me in the middle of the working season, and was not found to be well managed in many matters of detail in connec- tion with aseptic precautions. Very thorough supervision, and a training in antiseptic methods far in advance of that given to vaccinators, are required in the preparation of lymph preserved by admixture. Vaccination in Municipalities. 19. The vaccination in Municipalities during the past year shows an increase of 2,672 successful primary vaccinations as com- pared with 1897-98, and a proportion of 33.11 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population as compared with a pro- portion of 32.51 protected in the preceding year. In 72 Municipalities there was an increase in the number of successful primary vaccinations, and in 32 Municipalities a decrease. In Farukhabad-Fatehgarh, Khairabad and Lakhimpur, the decrease is attributed to the negligence of the Municipal vaccinators, who have been punished; in Allahabad, Chunar, Hardoi and Lucknow to a diminution in the birth-rate closely approximating the decrease in vaccination ; in Benares the decrease is apparent only, the work of the previous year having included that done outside municipal limits ; in Gházipur the decrease is attributed to the fears of the people connected with plague inoculations. In the year 1897-98 there were 4,987 re-vaccinations resulting from the widely- spread outbreak of small-pox, whereas last year only 3,896 re-vaccinations were per- formed. The percentage of success in primary cases was 95.01. The Municipalities best protected were Tilhar with a proportion of 111.73, Sambhal with 74.28, Sultánpur with 64.11, Bahraich with 56.10, Chandausi with 55.00, Amroha with 52.86, Sikand- rabad with 50.49 and Fatehpur with 50.15. The least protected Municipalities were Brindaban with a proportion of 16.99, Almora with 17.00, Kálpi with 19.03 and Pilibhít with 19.91. Brindaban is a pilgrim resort with a large proportion of aged persons. Working of the Vaccination Act. 20. The Vaccination Act is in force in all Municipalities, but the thorough- ness of enforcement varies considerably; Register No. 1 is not properly kept in Dehra Dún, Sikand- rabad, Soron, Jalesar, Bareilly, Utraula and Balrampur ; and Register No. II is frequently incomplete. Register No. I, in spite of instructions that its purpose is to record the names of all children born within the Municipality, is not infrequently a record only of children vaccinated. Vaccinators are in some instances required to keep up the registers, instead of the Municipality, and this heavy clerical work inter- feres with vaccination. The issue of certificates of vaccination was satisfactory. Notices are generally issued by Municipalities under sections 17 and 18 of the Vaccination Act, but usually no further action is taken and prosecutions are extremely rare. In Hardwár, Mussoorie, Deoband, Koil, Mirzapur-Bindhachal and Chunar no notices were issued. In Aligarh district the Municipal Boards passed resolutions ordering the Municipal vaccinators not to issue notices to parents
( 16 ) to produce their children for vaccination, until the member of the ward in which the parent resided had been asked to endeavour to have the child vaccinated, and as members were not always willing to act at the time when called on by the vaccinator, vaccination has practically ceased to be compulsory. Names of gentlemen who assisted vaccination. 21. The following gentlemen gave special assistance to vaccination during the year:( 17 ) Munshi Gauri Sahai, Tahsildar, Padrauna, Gorakhpur.

Lala Kidar Nath, Taluqdar of Daulatpur, Murwan, Hardoi. Pandit Manik Lal Joshi, Deputy Collector, Ballia. Conduct of officials. 22. It was found necessary to dismiss 30, to degrade 10, and to suspend 4, officials. Fines were inflicted to the number of 373. The list is a long one, but in order to main- tain accurate records and ensure a reasonable return of work it is necessary to take serious notice of all instances of idleness or dishonesty detected and proved. Delay in appearance of report. 23. This report was due on July 1st, but its issue was retarded by the late receipt of the 1st Circle returns, a circumstance which, it is hoped, will not occur again.

It is still generally true that vaccination is most advanced in the western districts and in the Lucknow Divi- sion, and most backward in the eastern part of the Provinces. The ratio per mille of the population (municipalities being included with the districts) of successful vaccinations in 1898-99 for the Meerut and the Lucknow Divisions is shown in the margin. Next to Garhwál (72.22) and Almora (56.21), the Sitapur district shows the highest ratio of successful vaccinations in the Provinces. The figures for the Gorakhpur and Benares Divisions are margin- ally noted. The following are the districts showing a ratio of less than 20: Farukhabad (19.93), Bara Banki (18.65), Bánda (18.12), Allahabad (17.24), and Azamgarh (18.45). No useful comparison can be made of the figures for 1898-99 with those of 1896-97 and 1897-98, as in both the two earlier years small-pox prevailed suffi- ciently in the Provinces to cause the vaccination work in many dis- tricts to be prolonged into the hot weather, which was not the case in 1898-99. The ratio in the Allahabad district (apart from the munici- pality) in 1898-99 was only 16.54: the insufficiency of vaccination in this important district was noticed by the Government in 1896 and again last year, and, though it is doubtless due in great measure to the reluctance of the people, the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commis- sioner requests that both the Sanitary Commissioner and the District Officer will not fail to give the matter serious attention. 4. The prevalence of small-pox in 1896 and 1897 is noticed in paragraph 9 of the report. In 1896 the incidence of the disease was heaviest in the Allahabad district, where the death rate caused by it was 4.1 per mille; in 1897 it was heaviest in the Sultánpur district, the death rate being 5.98. The provincial death rate in 1897 from small- pox was 1.86 per mille; the highest previous figure had been 1.26 in 1890 since the time of the epidemic in 1884, when the figure was 4.59. The diagram annexed to paragraph 10 of the report shows how far less the ravages of the disease have been since 1884 than they were between 1876 and that date, and encourages the hope that the spread of vaccina- tion may eventually result in an immunity not much less than that enjoyed by European countries. In 1898-99 the provincial death rate from small-pox was .05 per mille, and the rate only rose above 1 in the districts of Azamgarh, Kheri, and Sultánpur. 5. A comparison of the total number of successful primary operations in 1896( 3 ) by the increases (chiefly in Gonda, Gorakhpur, Basti, and Mirzapur) in the 2nd Circle, aggregating 48,442. The inference seems to be that improved administration produced an effect in some backward eastern districts that was not nullified by the general causes which are referred to by the Sanitary Commissioner in his paragraph 12 as producing a decrease, and which preclude any opinion being pronounced as to the normal progress of vaccination during the three years under review. These causes( 4 ) limited number of persons the increase in the numbers of those who have been previously vaccinated may reduce the operations, and in many places the decrease in the past three years, as compared with those preceding, is partly attributable to a decreased birth rate. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities in these Provinces. In his paragraphs 19 and 20 the Sanitary Commissioner has noticed the municipalities in which the administration of the Act is least effective, and District Officers will be asked to bring his remarks to the notice of the Chairmen of the Boards concerned. The Commissioner, Meerut Division, should report to Government the circumstances under which it is stated that vaccination has practically ceased to be compulsory within the municipalities of the Aligarh district. 9. The Sanitary Commissioner is requested to convey the acknow- ledgments of Government to the gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 21 of the report as having rendered especial assistance to the Department during the year 1898-99. Major Thorold, Officiating Sanitary Com- missioner, has submitted a clear report on the triennial period. In 1898-99, as in the preceding years, the Government was obliged by circumstances to make exceptional demands on the time and energy of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners; and the Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Commissioner recognises that these officers bestowed upon the Vaccination Department all the atten- tion that could be spared from more immediately pressing needs.

The triennial report having been submitted last year, the remarks for the year 1899-1900 are brief in character. Full details will be given in the next triennial report. Constitution and strength of Vacci- nation Department. 2. The constitution and strength of the depart- ment during the year under report are shown in the following table:( 2 ) Increase is noticeable under each head of expenditure. The large increase of Rs. 5,889-15-11 under the heading &quot;pay of establishment&quot; is due to the presence of both the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners throughout the season, while in 1898- 99 one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was on furlough. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. 4. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna three pies compared with one anna five pies in 1898-99, and is the lowest on record. For reasons given in last year's report, the pay of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices is excluded from these calculations. General operations. 5.

Forty districts as well as the Native State of Tehri-Garhwál show an increase, and the remaining eight districts show a decrease in the number successful primary vaccinations as shown in the following table :( 3 ) Number. Circle. District. Primary successful vaccination. Increase. Decrease. 1898-99. 1899-1900. 19 First Circle( 4 ) revaccinations which numbered 21,905 compared with 15,554 in 1898-99. The decrease in Mirzapur is said to be due to (1) two old and experienced vaccinators being on plague duty and four vaccinators being deputed to Allahabad on Magh Mela duty for six weeks ; these were replaced by inexperienced probationers; (2) the district authorities having for all practical purposes discouraged vaccination by making a point of instructing the people that vaccination was not compulsory, with the result &quot; that when vaccinators visited many villages after the authorities had been there, the people in many cases hardly allowed them inside the village.&quot; The matter was reported to the Commissioner, Benares Division, who late in the season wrote to the present Magistrate of the district directing him to encourage vaccination.

The results of the operations performed in the Lucknow district from the lymph supplied from the local lymph depôt were satisfactory, the percentage of success being 96.99 for primary operations and 77.20 for revaccinations. The results obtained from the lymph supplied to several military officers in other stations were not satisfactory. The bad results were probably due to the fact that the crude lymph does not retain its efficacy for any length of time. There were two other minor depôts, one at Allahabad and the other at Bahraich. The percentage of success in the former was 92.17 for primary operations and in the latter 91.86. The results of the lanoline calf lymph supplied by the lymph depôt at Allahabad for the use of Municipal vaccinators are reported by the Deputy Sanitary
( 12 ) Commissioner to be most disappointing. The supervision is reported to be bad. Action has been taken to remedy the defects. The scheme for establishing a central depôt in the hills for the preparation of bovine lymph is still under the consideration of the Government. Vaccination in municipalities. 12. The vaccination in municipalities during the year 1899-1900 shows an increase of 14,828 successful primary operations as compared with 1898-99, and a proportion of 37.97 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population as compared with a proportion of 33.10 in the preceding year. The municipalities best protected were Sambhal with a proportion of 78.92, Gonda with 76.32, Naini Tal with 69.79, Sultánpur with 69.25, Chandausi with 64.03, Moradabad with 60.75, and Bahraich with 60.26. The least protected municipalities, excluding Brindaban and Hardwár Union, where circumstances are special, were Lucknow with 26.73, Farukhabad- Fatehgarh with 27.23, Sikandra Rao with 27.41, Háthras with 27.84, and Sháhja- hánpur with 27.89. Under the orders conveyed in G. G. O. No. 87 of the 8th January 1900, modi- fied by G. G. O. No. 1296 of 7th May 1900, a table showing the number of children under one year of age in the municipal towns of North-Western Provinces and Oudh available for vaccination and the number of successful operations performed on them is appended. An examination of this table shows that the term &quot; compul- sory &quot; as applied to vaccination is, in a very large number of municipalities, a misnomer.

Gorakhpur ... ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 2179/XVI( 2 ) Province. The total number of persons vaccinated during 1899-1900 in the first or western circle (719,739) did not differ greatly from that (783,939) in the second or eastern circle, but there was the usual difference (on which Government commented last year) in infantile vaccination, 531,100 children under one year of age having been successfully vaccinated in the 1st Circle and 317,575 in the 2nd Circle. The latter figure, however, shows a considerable advance from that (199,199) in the preceding year. 4. The number of successful primary operations in municipal towns in 1899-1900 was 116,656, and of successful re-vaccinations 3,07,1 as compared with 101,828 and 2,545 respectively in the previous year: the proportion successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population being 33.10 in 1898-99 and 37.97 in 1899-1900. At the suggestion of the Army Sanitary Commission the Government of India directed the inclusion in the Vaccination Report of a statement relating to children under one year of age in municipal towns. In this statement (given in paragraph 12 of the report) the number available for vaccination is calculated by deducting from the number of births during the year the number of children under one year who died; but, as a good many of the latter were doubtless born in the preceding year, the calculation does not appear to be trustworthy. Moreover, many of the children who died were, until they died, available for vaccination. It is supposed that these causes account for the fact that in many towns the number of infants shown as successfully vaccinated exceeds the number shown as available for vaccination. 5. The acknowledgments of Government should be conveyed by the Sanitary Commissioner to the gentlemen who are mentioned in paragraph 14 of the report as having rendered special assistance to the Department during the year.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNotes on Vaccination in the North-Western Pro- vinces and Oudh for the year 1900-1901. Constitution and strength of the Department. 1. There has been no change in the constitution of the Vaccination Department, except in the number of vacci- nators, which, according to Statement II, was 921 as opposed to 934 in the previous year. Statement II. Expenditure on vaccination. 2. The total expenditure on vaccination during the year under report amounted to Rs. 1,37,470-10-5, as compared with Rs. 1,38,932-6-2 in 1899- 1900, showing a decrease of Rs. 1,461-11-9. The decrease has chiefly- occurred under the head of pay of establishment. Ditto. Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination. 3. The average cost of each successful case of vaccination was the same as last year, i. e., one anna three pies. Statement I. General operations. 4. There has been an increase of 37,797 in the number of persons vaccinated, of 48,845 in the number of successful primary operations, of 25 in the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator, of 1.14 in the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, and of 4,708 in the number of successful re-vaccinations, as compared with the previous year. The percentage of successful primary cases in which the results were known has also risen from 97.00 in 1899-1900 to 97.30 in 1900-1901. There has thus been improvement under all heads, and that in spite of the fact that some of the most experienced vaccinators were deputed on plague duty, and that it was necessary to use much caution in conducting operations in districts in which plague prevailed. Thirty-eight districts show an increase in the number of successful primary vaccinations compared with 40 in the previous year. The most conspicuous are Bara Banki with 9,706, Jaunpur with 4,285, Sháhjahán- pur with 3,916, Gorakhpur with 3,913, and Sultánpur with 3,679. Out of 10 districts showing a decrease, Hamírpur stands first with a decrease of 4,190 operations. Then in order come Sitápur with 3,713, Ballia with 1,624, Muttra with 1,549, Benares with 1,376, and Gonda with 1,191. The decrease in Hamírpur is said to be due to a low birth-rate and to slack- ness on the part of some vaccinators, who have been punished. In Sitápur the decrease is described as due to (1) experienced vaccinators being deputed on plague and cholera duties until the end of December 1900, and (2) some vaccinators being appointed as enumerators in the last census. In Ballia and Benares the decrease is no doubt due, as stated by the District Superintendents of Vaccination and the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, to the prevalence of plague in both these districts, where the work had to be carried on with great circumspection to avoid causing alarm among the people. In some villages of the Ballia district the work was completely stopped, while in Benares it was closed on 15th March 1901, i. e., 16 days earlier than usual. In Muttra the decrease is attributed to a low birth-rate, while in Gonda the District Superinten- dent of Vaccination considers that more encouragement might be given by tahsíldárs and others. There has always been a good deal of hostility to vaccination in this district, however, and the authorities were probably well advised in abstaining from active persuasion at a time when men's minds were disturbed by wild rumours concerning plague preventive measures. Diagram. 5. A diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district is attached.
( 2 ) Vaccination in proportion to births. 6. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births was 43.76 for infants under one year, and 26.80 for children over one and under six years of age. The percentage for all age periods was 74.41. These figures do not include statistics of Tehri-Garhwál. Statement V. General results of inspection. 7. The District Superintendents of Vaccination and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners tested 158,239 cases or 10.21 per cent., and Assistant Superintendents and other inspecting officers 459,307 cases or 29.65 per cent., of the total operations, as compared with 134,614 or 8.91 per cent. and 456,379 cases or 30.19 per cent., respectively, in the previous year. The percentage of inspections by Assistant Superinten- dents of the total number of persons vaccinated was highest (66.14) in Almora and lowest (11.35) in Mirzapur. The Assistant Superintendent of Vaccination of Mirzapur will be called upon to furnish an explanation of this deficient inspection. Supply of lymph. 8. The supply of lymph from the hills to the plains was good, and lymph was established in almost all districts on due date. Lymph was supplied, as usual, to numerous military and other officers on application. Working of bovine lymph de- pôts. 9. Calf lymph is only used at present to a small extent, arm-to-arm vaccination being generally practised throughout the Provinces. Bovine lymph depôts, however, were maintained at Luck- now, Bahraich, and Allahabad for supplying lymph to the vaccinators employed in those localities, and worked satisfactorily. A site has now been selected and approved by Government for a central calf lymph depôt in the hills. The place selected is about six miles from Naini Tal. Plans and estimates are under preparation, and the work will, it is believed, be commenced almost immediately. This depôt will eventually provide animal lymph for the entire Province, and supersede the present arm-to-arm system of vaccination. Vaccination in municipalities. 10. Vaccination in municipalities during the year under report shows a decrease of 3,381 successful primary operations as compared with the previous year, and a proportion of 36.60 persons suc- cessfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, as compared with a propor- tion of 37.97 in the preceding year. The municipalities best protected were Sambhal with a proportion of 79.57, Gonda with 76.60, Orai with 69.30, Chandausi with 66.77, Amroha with 61.92, Haldwáni with 61.25, and Moradabad with 60.99. Sambhal, followed by Gonda, headed the list last year also. The least protected municipalities, excluding Brindaban and Hard- wár Union, where the circumstances are peculiar, were Nawábganj (Gon- da) with 19.32, Gházipur with 22.84, Nawábganj (Bara Banki) with 24.87, Benares with 25.36, Baghpat with 26.06, and Bela with 26.46. Working of the Vaccination Act. 11. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and can- tonments, but the rules are enforced with a varying degree of energy in different places. Names of gentlemen who assist- ed vaccination. 12. A list of such gentlemen will be separately submitted to Government. Conduct of officials. 13. The conduct of the officials was on the whole satisfactory, and vaccinators found fabricating their registers, or slack in their work, were suitably punished. NAINI TAL : The 1st July 1901. S. J.

( 7A ) APPENDIX B. Statistics relating to the number of children under one year of age in the municipalities of the North- Western Provinces and Oudh available for vaccination and the number of successful operations performed on them during the year 1900-1901ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 1668/XVI( 2 ) 4. There was a slight decrease in the number of successful primary vaccinations in municipal towns. Statistics showing the number of children under one year in these towns available for vaccination and the number of successful operations performed on them (Appendix B), compiled at the suggestion of the Army Sanitary Commission, exhibit generally the same peculiarities as last year. There is a striking differ- ence in the towns of Moradabad, Chandausi, Sambhal and Mirzapur- Bindháchal, where the number of successful vaccinations on children under one year is considerably in excess of the number of children under that age available for vaccination. The discrepancy is probably due to a faulty calculation of the age of the children by the vaccinators. 5. The acknowledgments of Government should be conveyed to the gentlemen mentioned in the Sanitary Commissioner's letter. ORDER.
