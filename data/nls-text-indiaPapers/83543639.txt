CONTENTS. LUNATIC ASYLUMSNo. 1013½ FROM SIR J. CAMPBELL BROWN, K. C. B., Surgeon- General, INDIAN MEDICAL SERVICE, (On leare,) To COLONEL H. K. BURNE, C. B., Secretary to the Government of India, MILITARY DEPARTMENT. Dated Fort William, the 24th November 1875. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit the General Report on the Lunatic Asylums, Vaccination, Hospitals and Dispensaries in the Bengal Presidency for the year 1873. The Report, which is the sixth of the series, has been compiled by Surgeon E. A. Birch, F. R. C. S., Civil Surgeon of Hazareebagh, and exhibits evidences of great care and judgment in the selection, from the voluminous materials placed at his disposal for that purpose, of really interesting and valu- able information, which he has moulded into a compact and systematic shape. 2. The general arrangement of the report is the same as that of its pre- decessors. Part I concerns Lunatic Asylums. No increase in the number of these institutions took place during the year. The number of admissions into, and residents in, asylums tends, however, year by year, to increase, and it is apparent that additional accommodation must ere long be provided for the in- creasing number of insane patients placed under detention and treatment in them. The overcrowding of asylums has caused more concern in the province of Bengal than in any other. It appears that, taking all the asylums of that province into account, the population was 52 per cent. in excess of accommo- dation. The pressure for space was most felt in the Dullunda and Dacca Asylums, where an excess of deaths from chest complaints was, I think with reason, attributed to over-population. A new asylum, constructed to hold 220 patients, was under construction at Berhampore, and has been opened since the close of the year. A small asylum for lunatics belonging to the province of Assam was also being constructed at Tezpore, and has recently been completed. These measures afford some, but not sufficient, relief, and the question of in- creased asylum accommodation for Bengal is now under the consideration of His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor. The proposed asylum at Cuttack has not yet been commenced, it is believed from want of funds. A trial has been made at Dacca on a small scale, as detailed at pages 11 and 17, of the Gheel system of boarding out harmless lunatics, but the results are not as yet suffi- ciently promising to warrant an extension of the system. The large and in- creasing number of criminal lunatics confined in asylums is remarkable. It has been proposed to build asylums specially for this class, as is the practice in Europe. The project has much to recommend it, and would relieve the over- crowded state of existing institutions. It is satisfactory to note the diminished death-rate of 1873. The Lucknow asylum has improved in this respect. This is attributed to the river Goomptee not having overflowed its banks during the year. The death-rates of the Lahore, Dacca and Delhi asylums are very high. In the smaller asylums the rates, as might be expected, vary very much. The miserable condition in which most lunatics are received into asylums, added to the danger to life inherent in their maladies, must always maintain a high mor- tality in hospitals for the insane. This part of the report contains much
( 2 ) valuable information regarding the causation, nature and treatment of insanity, which Mr. Birch has very clearly set forth. The medical officers who have been entrusted with the superintendence of these institutions have managed them with humanity and diligence, and there does not exist a better illustration of the benignity of British rule in India than the contrast which the present state and treatment of lunatics affords with their conditions and usage in times past. 3. The records of vaccination during the year ending 31st March 1874 exhibit satisfactory and encouraging results. The agency employed was larger, and the amount of work done more considerable. The cost to the State of vaccination was higher, but in relation to the outturn of work lower than in any preceding year. Still, notwithstanding much and steadily increasing pro- gress, the amount of vaccination accomplished falls far short of the require- ments of the population, and the protection against small-pox conferred in this manner does not amount to more than one-third of what it ought to be. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that this disease continues to prevail in all the provinces of the presidency, and to cause a very considerable mortality. In the year 1873-74, small-pox was widely and severely prevalent. Quite apart from the amount of protection against it enjoyed by a population, the disease, from causes at present unknown, is apt to recur epidemically in cycles of a few years. The year under report appears to have been an epidemic one for small- pox, more particularly in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces. Even in Europe, where vaccination, enforced by law, is all but universal, small-pox is apt to break out and spread periodically. Its incidence and mortality are, of course, lower; but the experience of well protected countries must needs be repeated with more disastrous consequences in worse protected or unprotected countries. The problem of efficiently vaccinating India is one of serious diffi- culty, both on account of the great cost of the measure and the peculiar poli- tical and social circumstances of the country. Many questions intimately affecting this problem, e. g., the feeling of the people, the prevalence of the practice of inoculation, the employment of ex-inoculators in vaccination, the employment of female vaccinators, the establishing of self-supporting vacci- nation, are intelligently discussed in this section. Up to this point vaccination has been introduced among an unwilling and often hostile people by State agencies, working, without legal sanction, under the authority and with the moral support of Government: the ultimate aim must be universal self-sup- porting vaccination, and this end must either be attained by the spontane- ous motion of the people or the compulsory effect of law. The goal cannot be reached for many years, but it is right to keep it clearly in view, and to sub- ordinate every effort to its attainment. 4. Charitable hospitals and dispensaries, concerning which Part III con- tains full and interesting details, continue to multiply. The number of institu- tions of this descriptions in operation in 1873 exceeded that of the previous year by 58, and this is but a step in a progress of which every succeeding year gives evidence. The number of the sick resorting for relief to dispen- saries is yearly undergoing a corresponding increase. There can be no question whatever regarding the great and growing appreciation of these institutions by the people, and the amount of good which they accomplish. The dispensary movement has now acquired such root in India that the question now is, not how to promote it, but how to relieve the State of the heavy burden which these charitable institutions impose on the public revenues, and to transfer it to local resources. Some progress is being made in this direction by entrust- ing the care and support of dispensaries to municipal corporations. As the latter become more habituated to develope and control local resources, this policy can, doubtless, be more extensively put in practice, and it is one which recommends itself strongly on every ground. Although the year under report was not remarkable for any unusual sickness, with the exception of the epidemic prevalence of small-pox, to which I have referred, there is always in every part of India a sufficiency of disease to give full employment to dispensaries were they multiplied ten-fold. The efforts which have been made to educate native medical practitioners, hakims and others, in order to enable them to treat disease rationally and successfully, have not been attended with much benefit. These men are quite ignorant of anatomy and pathology, and it is impossible without
( 3 ) a knowledge of these subjects to treat disease intelligently. The system which obtains in the Punjab of educating hakims and their sons in the Lahore Medical College, and after they have been there systematically trained send- ing them back to their districts to practise, is a sound and promising one. The only part of India in which educated practitioners have to any extent settled down to practise is Lower Bengal, where the graduates and licentiates of the Calcutta Medical College have found it possible to make a livelihood by the practice of their profession. It is to this agency that we must look for the limitation of the growth of establishments and institutions for gratuitous medi- cal relief, for the ultimate attainment of universal and self-supporting vaccina- tion, for correct death registration, and the improvement of village sanitation. The medical schools and colleges which are springing up in various parts of the presidency are thus destined to fulfil a most important function in the country, and are deserving of liberal support and every encouragement. I have again much pleasure in testifying to the great interest which medical officers, both administrative and executive, continue to take in the welfare and success of charitable hospitals and dispensaries. 5. I have again, I regret to say, to apologise for the late submission of this report. The causes are those which I have detailed in submitting that of the preceding year. The record will, I believe, be found convenient for reference, and I experience no small gratification in the feeling that this, the last report which it will be my duty to present to Government in my capacity of Surgeon- General, contains such ample and satisfactory evidence of the energy and devotion which actuate the members of the department over which I have had the honor to preside. I have the honor to be, SIR, Your most obedient Servant, J. CAMPBELL BROWN, Surgeon- General, Indian Medical Service.
PART I. LUNATIC ASYLUMS IN BENGAL. BHOWANIPORE ASYLUM (CALCUTTA). FOR EUROPEANS AND EURASIANS ONLY. Surgeon-Major R. Bird, M. D., held charge during the first quarter of the year, and Surgeon-Major A. J. Payne, M. D., during the remainder. Statistics. The statistics of five years are given in the statement below :2 LUNATIC ASYLUMS FOR NATIVES. [Part 1. Diminished number of military insanes accounted for. Only four military lunatics were admitted during the year against 22 in 1872, in consequence of the adoption of a new method of dealing with insane soldiers at up-country stations by which they are transferred direct to Bom- bay, and thus to a great extent the diminished population is accounted for. Mortality. But the number of admissions of civil insanes was also unusually small, only 23 against 48 in 1872, whilst a greater number (viz., 6) were despatched to Europe, and no less than 18 were either cured or had so far improved that they were transferred to friends. For these reasons there has been so considerable a falling off in the number of inmates. The mortality, as stated, was unusually high, the ratio to average strength being 14.7 per cent., but this result was caused by only 4 deaths, one from heat apoplexy in the person of an inmate who had been 20 years in the asylum, the second individual had been in the asylum for 4 years and died from fever, the third had been an inmate for 7 months only and died from his primary disease, namely, paralysis and softening of the brain, and the fourth had only been 6 weeks an inmate, the cause of death being apoplexy, and must therefore be regarded as being acci- dental. Finances. As a consequence of the fall in numbers, there was, of course, a reduced expenditure, and for the same reason the charge for fixed establishment as distributed among individual patients was higher, viz. Rs. 912 against Rs. 470, more than half of which is debited to the head of Establishment. Cures. The ratio per cent, of cures to total treated shows a very satisfactory figure, 25 against 12.8, and males and females contributed equally to this result. Visitors' inspection. The inspections of visitors were made with unfailing regularity. The sanitary arrangements and general management remained unchanged Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General H. B. Buckle, C. B., inspected the asylum frequently, and reports in high terms upon the management, " attention being paid to every thing that can increase the well-being and comfort of the in- mates," and the Surgeon-General " fully endorses" Dr. Buckle's testimony in his comments upon the report.

We thus see that the average recovery rate of all the asylums for the whole series of years has been 44.1 per cent. of admissions, the rate for the present year being 47.08. These figures represent very favourable results indeed. The numbers for the various asylums vary a good deal: thus we have 54.1 per cent. of recoveries at Patna, 31.97 at Jubbulpore, and 14.15 at Ran- goon. The proportion of males who recovered exceeded that of females (44.96 to 40.87.) According to causes of insanity. Regarding the question of the recovery-rate again as affected by the different causes of insanity, a reference to table No. II will furnish full and detailed information. The proportion of recoveries from insanity which was due to physical causes was 19.3 per cent. of treated, and that due to moral causes was only 14.6 per cent. of treated. According to types. Acute mania gave the largest proportion of recoveries (25.6 per cent, of treated); next in order comes melancholia (20.7 per cent.); then acute demen- tia (19.1) and chronic mania (14.5); whilst chronic dementia, idiotcy, and imbecility gave very low rates (about 6 per cent. of treated.) According to dura- tion of residence. The question of recoveries according to the duration of residence is an important one, and is considered in the following statement. It is to be regret- ted that some of the returns from which this statement has been compiled are imperfect, and in other instances the information has not been furnished. On the whole, it must be admitted that it would not, perhaps, be safe to base inferences upon these figures. The statement, however, upholds the well-estab- lished fact, that the greatest number of recoveries take place during the earlier periods of residence.

The first place is held by Lahore with a ratio of mortality to strength of 22.27 against 45.8 of Lucknow for 1872. Lahore held the second place (with 36.3 per cent) in 1872, so that although its position in the list this year is unfortunate, a considerable reduction has been effected in the rate of its mortality. Delhi has preserved its place in the order, but the rate has fallen from 28.6 to 17.5. Of the total 14 asylums, 11 show a diminished death-rate, and of the three which exhibit less favourable results, Dacca has increased but very slightly, whilst the figures for Rangoon and Patna, though increased, do not indicate what can be termed unfavourable rates. The most noticeable features of the year as drawn from a comparison of the statement with that of the previous year, are the generally lower death-rates almost everywhere, and the very marked reductions which are recorded in the cases of Lucknow and Cuttack. The reason assigned for this result at Lucknow is that the river Goomtee never once overflowed its banks during the year; and so far as Cuttack is concerned, the Superintendent in the previous year's report correctly explained that statistics of such very small numbers for limited periods are liable to present occasional accidental and startling results, and are of no real value. The Cuttack asylum affords a good example of this, the death- rate to strength in 1871 having been 8.9, in 1872, it was 25.6, and in 1873 only 2.03. The Dacca asylum suffered severely from cholera, but in. none of the other institutions of the presidency did a single death from this scourge occur. Mortality rate of each province and of Madras, compared. The mortality of the year in each province separately and in Madras is thus compared:8 LUNATIC ASYLUMS FOR NATIVES. [Part I. Mortality according to type and origin of insanity whole series of years). The year 1873 was no exception to the above general result, the ratio per cent. of males who died to admissions of males was 23.8, and of females to admissions of females 29.8. Tables No. II and III exhibit the mortality according to the types of insanity, and according to the cause and origin of the insanity. Paralysis caused no less than 20 per cent. of deaths of treated. Excluding paralysis, melancholia and idiotcy were the most fatal forms of mental disease, each giving about 15 per cent. of deaths on cases treated. Acute mania and imbecility rank next with a percentage of a little over 9, whilst chronic mania, acute dementia and chronic dementia occa- sioned over 7 per cent. of deaths on treated. Insanity due to moral causes was more fatal than that due to physical causes. Of the moral causes, grief was the most fatal. Of the physical causes, excluding those of which but few cases were treated, opium and epilepsy were the most fatal in proportion to the number treated. The preparations of Indian hemp caused 7 per cent. of deaths of those treated for insanity thus produced. Insanity due to fever was fatal in the ratio of 7.5. Alcoholic spirits was accountable for 5.4 per cent. of deaths of those treated.

Unfortunately, the returns from which this statement was compiled were imperfectly rendered in some cases, so that the general results must be re- ceived with some amount of reservation. Of the total deaths noted in the state- ment, 26 per cent. occurred within three months of residence, 59 per cent. with- in one year, and 88 per cent. within five years. Table No. IV gives information as to the causes of mortality. Dysentery ranks first in the list of fatal causes, and accounts for 70 deaths, debility caused 43 deaths, diarrhPart I.] GENERAL REPORT. 9 adding the bad and indifferent together, the percentages were, for males 60, and for females 72. This comparison is interesting when viewed in relation to the greater death-rate which has prevailed amongst females. Types of insanity. The types of insanity of the inmates of the asylums are shown in Table No. II. Chronic mania contributed by far the most of those who were treated, but more than half the admissions were for acute mania : chronic mania coiming second in order, by contributing about half as many as the former: chronic de- mentia shows a large number treated, but only ranks fifth in the order of admis- sions. The type of insanity as affected by race is one upon which more infor- mation might with advantage be collected. The Superintendent of the Rangoon asylum makes the following remarks upon the subject. He writes :10 LUNATIC ASYLUMS FOR NATIVES. [Part I. medans. Among the five Mahomedans, however, two were Hindus by birth. The two fe- males admitted from this cause were Mahomedan prostitutes.

According to Dr. Wise, the natives generally ascribe insanity to "Bayu" which seems to be vertigo, due to blood poisoning from putridal emanations, or to any chronic and debilitating disease. Over-crowding. Overcrowding everywhere existed in the province of Lower Bengal, and the population of the asylums was actually 52 per cent. in excess of the existing accommodation. There was " a dangerous want of room for the lodgment of patients " at Dullunda. Dacca was "grossly overcrowded"; and in both of these institutions the mortality from chest affections as a result of overcrowding was heavy. Increased accommodation is urgently appealed for in the case of the Patna asylum. The male wards of the Cuttack asylum accommodated a daily average of 40.5 patients, whilst their capacity entitled them to not more than 31; and to prevent a still further increase of population, it was found necessary to prohibit the transfer of insanes from the Central Provinces, as hitherto existed. In the Moydapore asylum the population continued large in propor- tion to the size of the institution, but there was the prospect of speedy relief by the transfer of its inmates to the new and larger buildings at Berhampore. The following table, which is extracted from the appendix to the Surgeon- General's report to the Bengal Government, shows the capacity of each of the asylums in the province, calculated at the rate of 50 superficial feet per inmate, together with the number resident on December 31st, 1872.

Additional accom- modation to relieve overcrowding. Additional accommodation is being provided at Berhampore, calculated to contain 225 patients. The building of a new asylum sanctioned at Cuttack by Government in September, with accommodation for 80 to 100 patients, is about to be carried out. Both these new sites promise to prove suitable in all but one particular, viz., the deficiency of large and shady trees, which add so much to the comfort and health of the patients by enabling them to live for the chief part in the open air. It was intended that the new asylum at Berhampore should supersede that at Moydapore, but in consequence of the urgent necessity for space, His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor has decided to maintain the latter in addition to the former, thus affording relief to Dullunda and Patna. The construction of an asylum at Tezpore to receive insanes from Assam, which province is at present a tax upon the Dacca institution, is under the considera- tion of Government. In the North-Western Provinces, as stated in the last year's report, a new asylum is being constructed at Pandeypore, intended to supersede the present Benares institution, but not much progress was made in the building during the year. Gheel system. The Belgian or Gheel system of boarding out harmless lunatics, which was sanctioned in 1872 by the Bengal Government, was tried on a small scale at Dacca, with very poor success so far; but it would seem probable that, when the natives have overcome their dread of the consequences of their responsibility in accepting such charges, the system is one calculated to commend itself to them, and by perseverance alone can success be attained. It may here be mentioned that the conditions upon which Government desire to establish the system are a careful selection of perfectly harmless insanes ; that their friends are not in a position to maintain them; that they are domiciled in a known place with a known person; that they are periodically inspected, and that, when visited, the general care bestowed upon them be investigated.
12 LUNATIC ASYLUMS FOR NATIVES. [ Part I. Mechanical restraint. Mechanical restraint has been almost nominal in its employment through- out the year. The Surgeon-General desires that restraint be employed as sparing- ly as possible, whilst he would allow every latitude to medical officers to treat cases according to their judgment and experience. Only in two asylums was mechanical restraint resorted to, viz., Dullunda and Lucknow (there are no records on the point for Lahore) 39 persons were restrained 130 times at Dullunda, and 29 persons 62 times at Lucknow. It is clear that a very modified form of restraint was employed, and that under the immediate supervision of the Superintendent. Dr. Shircore of the Moydapore Asylum writes:Part I.] GENERAL REPORT. 13 Conium. In the Rangoon asylum, Dr. Griffith obtained satisfactory results from the employment of chloral, which he states has in his practice " quite super- seded opium, except in some cases of melancholia, where morphia is found bene- ficial." Conium he employed in the shape of an extract, as recommended by American physicians in cases of recurrent mania, accompanied by irritability, constant restlessness and sleeplessness, with agitation of manner and wild incoherence; but after many trials he abandoned its use, and he believes it to be inoperative, subsidence of the violence of the excitement never having followed its free administration. Dr. Corbyn gives the following valuable information concerning the thera- peutical effects and value of several drugs :14 DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM. [Part I. Requirements essen- tial no means easy to concentrate all the requirements of such a building as a lunatic asylum adapted for India, in a single plan. It must be spacious and cheerful, as unlike a prison either in its surrounding wall or buildings as possible, and yet secure. The buildings must be so arranged as to permit the freest ventilation, and yet so concentrated as to facilitate the labour of supervision and obviate the necessity for an excessive establishment. Large, separate and cheerful quarters should be provided for the women, isolated quarters for criminals, and cells for the noisy and dangerous, besides many minor points. It is satisfactory to know that the subject is engaging the attention of the Surgeon-General, who is in consultation with the Public Works Department. Importance of trees in an asylum. The cultivation of trees within an asylum area is a most important matter as regards the health of the inmates from the facility it gives the patients, whose habits are usually somewhat dirty, of living in the open air; and the inmates are never slow to take advantage of the opportunity when it offers of doing so. Surronuding wall. Dr. Payne advocates that the surrounding wall of an asylum should be low, on other grounds than those of dissimilitude to a prison, and the idea of non-restraint conveyed. He writes:Part I.] DULLUNDA LUNATIC ASYLUM. 15 Statistics. The resident population continued its progressive increase. The admissions were somewhat fewer than in 1872, 184 against 191, but higher by 30 than the average of 10 years, and higher than in any single year of the ten except 1872 ; still they bear a smaller ratio to an increasing strength. The recoveries have been unprecedentedly high16 DACCA LUNATIC ASYLUM. [Part I. orders of the Superintendent, in all cases in which he deems restraint essential.

Some relief from the new Assam asylum probable. accommodated and cared for." Instead of that, these unfortunates are crowded into quarters where they die in the proportion of from sixteen to nineteen per cent. per annum. In reply to representations on the subject, Government, in a letter dated 9th April, suggested the construction of temporary sheds and the utilization of some of the work-sheds as a provisional arrangement pending the erection of an asylum for criminal lunatics; but there was unfor- tunately only one work-shed in existence, part of which was used as a godown and bakery, and to the housing of lunatics in sheds composed of inflammable materials the objections were deemed overwhelming. The building of the new asylum in Assam holds out some hope of relief. The Gheel system. Efforts have been persisted in to induce the more respectable classes of natives to undertake the care of harmless lunatics for a fair remuneration, upon the Gheel system of boarding out the insanes, and thus securing some relief from overcrowding; but arrangements could be made with only two residents of the city for the care of six lunatics upon the conditions demanded. The remuneration given in each case was Rs. 5 per head per mensem. If the system could be freely extended upon these terms, the saving effected to the asylum would be considerable, as the average monthly cost of each man during the year was Rs. 7-10 ; but the consequences of escape or death of the proposed charge seem to act as a deterrent to those who might be entrusted with the responsibility. Mortality. Deaths according to length of residence. Deaths according to sex. Deaths according to season. The mortality in this asylum continues terribly high ; chest diseases caused 12 of the deaths, and next in order stands cholera, which broke out severely in November and is responsible for 11 deaths. Dysentery accounts for 5 deaths, and debility for an equal number. There was also one fatal case of typhoid fever. Of the 47 fatal cases, " there died within a year of their arrival 31, or 65.9 per cent., while during 1872 only 19, or 47.5 per cent., died during a corresponding period. The average period of residence has accord- ingly diminished from 977 days in 1872 to 621 days in 1873. The number of deaths of short term inmates was larger than in. the previous year. Five died within a month of arrival, 20 within six months, and 31 within 12 months, against 3,17, and 19 respectively for 1872. Males died at the rate of 19.8 per cent. and females at 17 02 per cent., and November, August, January and December were in order the most fatal months. Of the total admissions 17.3 per cent. died, while in 1872 only 9.6 died. Disproportionate pre- valence of lunacy in Sylhet district. Causes of this. Criminal lunatics. Health on admission. In last year's report it was shown that Sylhet gave a greater number of admissions than any other district in Eastern Bengal. The same peculiarity was preserved in 1873. Both the Civil Surgeon and the Magistrate agree in referring the cause to " an innate mental weakness, possibly due to intermarry- ing too closely," and " to the usual physical and moral causes that dispose to unsoundness of mind." Dr. Wise shows that ganja cannot be accused as the principal cause in Sylhet, as only 8 seers and 7 chittacks per 1,000 of population are consumed, while in Mymensingh it is 14 seers and 4 chittacks; and he adds,18 PATNA LUNATIC ASYLUM. [Part I. Restraint. Mechanical restraint was not employed at all during the year, and solitary confinement but sparingly. Establishment. The permanent establishment of keepers was raised from 20 to 22. Finances. The total expenditure was Rs. 22,336. The cost per man was Rs. 91-8-7 against Rs. 87-7-3 in 1872, the increase being on account of additional establishment. The cost of dieting each man was Rs. 46-12-8 against Rs.39-9-2, the increase being due to the higher prices of meat and fish, and to the fact that milk, vegetables and oil, which were formerly issued gratis by Government, were supplied by contract. The actual cash profit derived from manufactures was Rs. 2,163, but the estimated value of the patients' labour was no less than Rs. 6,833. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General D. Macdonald, M D., in forwarding the report, testifies to the urgent necessity for increased accommodation, and he concurs with the Superintendent in attributing the high mortality from chest complaints to the vitiated air developed by overcrowding.

The population of the asylum is rapidly increasing. The admissions numbered 126. The recoveries and discharges were absolutely above the average, but in proportion to population, below the results of past years. Deaths numbered 27 against 16 last year, being a mortality of 10.05 per cent. of strength, being a comparatively high rate for this asylum, the average of the previous 10 years having been 16.1. Causes of mortality. The mortality was chiefly due to fever, diarrhPart I. ] CUTTACK LUNATIC ASYLUM. 19 Sickness. Mortality. No epidemic occurred during the year, but owing to the unusually large proportion of persons who were in a bad state of health when admitted, the number remaining sick at the end of the year was considerably in excess of those who remained from the previous year. As stated, the mortality was unusually high for the Patna asylum, which has always maintained a high standard of health. On this point Dr. Simpson writes as follows :20 MOYDAPORE LUNATIC ASYLUM. [ Part I. Temporary measure to arrest overcrowd- ing. To obviate overcrowding as far as possible, the reception of lunatics from Sumbulpore was discontinued, and thus in a great measure is the smallness of the admissions accounted for. Sickness.

The chief employments were garden-work, morah making, wheat grinding, &c., amongst the males, whilst the females spin jute and husk dall. The Superintendent approves highly of wheat-grinding as an occupation for lunatics, as he considers that it rather "amuses" them, and that it " is much safer than most of the other occupations, as it does not necessitate any kind of dangerous instruments being placed in the hands of the lunatics." Overcrowding. The capacity of the asylum is for 37 males and 10 females, in all for 47 inmates, but the daily average strength for the past year has been 46.82 males, 13.13 females, total 59.95. There has therefore been overcrowding, but this will soon be relieved by the transfer of the inmates to the new building which is being adapted for them in Berhampore. Attempt to educate the inmates. A successful attempt is being made by the darogah to educate some of the patients. About 20 received instruction in Bengali and have made good progress; of this number only 4 had before been taught at all. Diet. The new scale of diet has been introduced. Formerly lunatics were allowed meat twice a month and fish once a week, whereas they now get either fish or meat daily. The allowances of rice and oil, too, have been increased. Finances. The total expenditure was Rs. 4,998, giving a net cost of a little over Rs. 83 per head of population. The cost of dieting increased from Rs. 21-1-7 to Rs. 26-7-0, owing to the higher prices of provisions and the introduction of the new scale. Not one of the inmates of this asylum is supported by rela- tions or friends. Inspection. The asylum was inspected by Deputy Surgeon-General H. B. Buckle, c. B., in November, and he considered the institution well and carefully conducted. Alluding to the buildings at Berhampore which are being converted, he points out that the new asylum will for many years be deficient in the large and shady trees which at Moydapore appear to add not only to the comfort but to the health of the patients from the facility given to their living so much in the open air. Intention to preserve both the old Moyda- pore and new Ber- hampore asylums. The Government resolution on the Surgeon-General's report states that it has been decided to maintain also the Moydapore asylum, which the new one at Berhampore was meant to supersede in consequence of the want of asylum accommodation in the province.

The daily average number of sick was 14.67. Both sickness and mortality were greatest during the season of increased cold and humidity, and in this respect the results corresponded with the rates observed amongst the general population and the prisoners in the central jail. The deaths amounted to 9.9 per cent. of the total treated. The causes of death were from dysentery 13, continued fever 1, general paralysis 1, laryngitis 1, and general debility 1. Of the total, 9 were in bad health at the time of admission; 14 of them were never considered fit for employment of any kind; 2 were occasionally employed; and only one (who died of acute laryngitis) was regularly employed. 224 patients were treated in hospital for bodily ailments. Bowel complaints accounted for 83, and fevers for 79 of these. Employment. An average of 90 patients was kept constantly employed, and the greatest care was taken to relieve any patient from labor whose health appeared to be in any degree affected injuriously, or who was found to be losing weight. Escapes. Two inmates succeeded in escaping, " a small number,"Dr. Rice considers, " when it is remembered that the asylum was not provided with any enclosing fence, and is near the city." Criminal lunatics. Criminal lunatics constituted nearly 7 per cent. of the population. Health on admis- sion. Of the 61 admissions, 12 were in good, 18 in indifferent, and 31 in posi- tively bad health at the time they entered the asylum. Finances. The total cost of the asylum was Rs. 10,131-9-6, and the rate per patient was Rs. 82-6-8 against Rs. 72-3-4 for 1872. The increase was due to extra contingencies chiefly, such as hired mistris to supervise and guide the works, the purchase of materials for the new hospital and convalescent ward, &c. Each diet cost a little more than in 1872 on account of the increased cost of cereals. Deducting Rs. 1,278-7-4 received from the treasury for advances, the net value of lunatic labour amounted to Rs. 4,983, or over Rs. 55-6 per man employed. New works. The report contains a detailed account of the progress made in the new works.

The general health is reported to have been " much as usual, the lunatics being on the whole pretty well, with the exception of those who, from the nature of their complaints, or some other cause, were in a bad state on admis- sion. Of the eight deaths, five were admitted into the asylum in so bad a state of health that it was clearly impossible to do anything more than prolong their lives and diminish their sufferings. Of the three that were admitted into the asylum in good health, one died of epilepsy in a fit, and the other two of acute diseases."

M., and then rest till about 3; after 3 they go out to work again till 5; then they are bathed and washed, and then they have their dinner; after dinner they sit about talking and smoking till sunset or dark, when they go to bed. Restraint. Mechanical restraint is never employed. Two lunatics escaped over the wall, but that was before the number of warders was increased and before the wall was raised. Establishment. Finances. The number of keepers was increased from four to seven. They are a lazy and indolent set of fellows. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 5,398-12-4 against Rs. 4,609-15-11 in 1872, and this excess was due to the increased establishment, increase in dietary, and the dearness of provisions. Each patient cost Rs. 118-6-2, and each diet Rs. 27-9-5. Inspection. Deputy Surgeon-General J. Tresidder inspected the asylum on January 5th, 1874, and found great improvement since last year in the institution. The loose sandy earth put down on the floors of the wards at my recommendation has kept them clean and dry and free from smell. The increase of food has done good, and the increase of establishment has prevented the necessity of keeping insanes long in cells. I observed, too, that some attempt has been made to amuse the insanes, and that musical instru- ments and toys were supplied. * * * The general appearance of the men is much better than it was the previous year. The medical history book of the insanes, which I ordered to be kept last year, now shows the medical history of every patient in the asylum, and I would beg to invite the attention of the official visitors of the asylum to this book when they are discussing the propriety or otherwise of discharging a patient, and entrusting him to the care of his friends, or setting him free altogether. The Secretary to the Government, in acknowledging the receipt of the report, remarks that the Lieutenant-Governor "considers the management of the asylum satisfactory and creditable to Dr. Taylor." LAHORE ASYLUM. Charge. Surgeon-Major J. B. Scriven was the Superintendent. Statistics.

Of course the value of this statement depends wholly upon the accuracy of the census tables, which, it is to be feared, are not, by any means, a safe basis from which to draw inferences, or upon which to found argument. Sufficiency of vacci- nation calculated on an assumed birth- rate. The sufficiency of vaccination has almost everywhere been estimated on the birth-rate, and three per cent. of births has been accepted as a fair working average; but though no objection is stated to this basis of calculation for Lower Bengal, the North-Western Provinces' Government speaks as follows : Part II.] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 43 Jail statistics of North-Western Pro- vinces. In the North-Western Provinces the jail report for 1872-73 showed that only 0.95 of the prisoners had been vaccinated, while 1.57 had been inoculated, and no less than 85.29 per cent. of them had had small-pox. Last year's report shows that out of 43,149 prisoners, 3.8 per cent. had been vaccinated. Schools in Punjab. In the schools in the city of Amritsur (Punjab), it was noticed in those in which there had been no vaccination, that more than one-half, often two- thirds, of the boys were marked with small-pox.

An excellent plan, and one which deserves imitation, was followed in the Eastern Bengal circle. The men were occupied in taking a vaccine census and in writing up the registers. If this plan was universally adopted, an immense mass of valuable information would in a very few years be forth- coming. The plan of attaching vaccinators during the recess to dispensaries is one which meets with little approbation from any quarter, and does not seem to be productive of benefit to anybody. The superintendent of the Darjeel- ing circle considers that it has a very bad effect. In the metropolitan circles leave to their homes is granted to the vaccinators from April to August on two-thirds of their pay. The arrangement in Hyderabad is novel, and certainly useful at the same time. The members of the establishment attended the school at Akolah during the months of July, August, and September, when they were instructed in general subjects, such as history, geography, and arithmetic. In the Punjab and North-West the greater part of the establishments are at work in the hills, collecting virus for the approaching season's operations in the plains. Sickness interfered with work. In many of the circles sickness interfered with work, but more parti- cularly in the Burdwan, Eastern Bengal, and Midnapore districts of Lower Bengal. In some parts of the North-Western Provinces, too, impediment was encountered from this cause. Sex of the vaccinated. Sex of the vaccinated.Part II. ] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 45 Sex of the vaccinated. Except in the Hyderabad Assigned Districts, the number of males vaccinated has everywhere exceeded the number of females. The even population of the figures with the census returns is noteworthy, and may be considered con- firmatory of the truth of the results. The North-Western Provinces show the most even proportions of the sexes vaccinated, and Oudh the most divergent; but in the former the percentage of females vaccinated is greater than the percentage in the total population. The Punjab ratios tally almost precisely with the census figures. Some of the reports contain interesting information on the subject of the sexes of the vaccinated. For instance, Dr. Richardson writes thus of the Agra and Meerut circles:46 VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. [ Part II. Caste of the vaccinated. Caste of the vaccinated.Part II. ] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 47 Inoculation in Bengal. remarks upon the Bengal report thus sums up the state of the case as it stands in that province :48 VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. [Part II accorded to strangers. I have no doubt that some of them may not be honest, and practise inoculation on the sly; but many of them do good work. The returns show an increase in the operations performed by these menPart II. ] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 49 Dr. Smith states that "a respectable native, if possible a Brahmin, would have much more influence amongst the people of Benares city than any European," whilst in the villages the influence of the European is overwhelm- ingly more powerful than that of any native. Assistance of civil au- thorities important. Another element which, perhaps, more powerfully than all others, influ- ences success is the proportion of real interest which the civil authorities of a district manifest in the work. In no sense is pressure required of them. " In fact," writes Dr. Richardson, " it may be generally said that in those districts in which the civil authorities distinctly let it be understood to be their wish that the people should accept of vaccination, opposition at once begins to decline." The wish of Government has been very clearly proclaimed, but it is to be feared that many magistrates do not actively foster that wish; but rather, because the matter is not one of compulsion by law, treat the whole subject with comparative apathy. Vaccination of the in- habitants of jails. With regard to the vaccination of prisoners, the superintendent of the Benares circle makes the following remark, which seems not to be unworthy of attention, especially recollecting that each jail has its medical officer who certainly could not complain of the labour of vaccinating a concentrated body of persons who are under complete control:50 VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. [Part II. nator appeared in the following season, all the mothers crowded around him with their infants, and two mothers who happened to be absent, followed him with their infants for ten miles to another village where he was vaccinating. Indications of educa- ted native opinion fa- vouring vaccination. A very interesting feature of the Punjab report, as indicating the bold and open course which educated native opinion is taking, is the fact that numerous lectures were delivered in the great cities, and pamphlets written in favour of vaccination and circulated freely by leading native members of several com- munities. A lecture which was delivered in the city of Amritsur was lithographed and posted at various parts of the city. It is a curious production, but is valu- able as showing the worth of an accurate knowledge of native character in the endeavour to confute their superstitious beliefs. It is transcribed below in full, and it will be observed that a reasoning process is employed. Such a line is, however, adopted as would never have struck a European, and the tendency to base all customs on religion is exemplified. The author, it is very evident, knew accurately the process which would tell most, and the civil surgeon acknowledges that the document influenced the better classes favourably towards vaccination. " The inhabitants of Europe are all familiar with the disease called small-pox, and they have proved by experiments that it is contagious. Formerly in England it was considered an incurable disease, and about thirty-six thousand lives were destroyed by it yearly. " Since the practice of vaccination has been discovered and its advantages known, the mortality of this dangerous malady has been reduced to such an extent that it occurs now at the rate of only 42 deaths per mille. " If this excellent prophylactic (roknawalah) mode of treatment be compared with ' ab-i-hayat'* or 'aksir,'Part II.] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 51 Attention to the pecu- liarities of the people and their customs es- sential to success. It can be easily understood that a thorough knowledge of the people and their superstitions is an essential qualification of a good superintendent. The Benares circle of the North-Western Provinces has suffered much from fre- quent changes of superintendents, who have annually been transferred else- where just as the requisite local information and qualification had been attained. The deputy superintendent of the Sonthal Pergunnahs has demonstrated what can be accomplished by studying the peculiarities of a strange people ; and the most astonishing success has been attained by the assistant surgeon at Peshawur simply by tact and perseverance in his management of the popula- tion of the city. Other examples might be given, but it is sufficient to state that the broad principle of attention to the peculiarities of the various races with which they come so closely in contact has been appreciated by superin- tending officers very generally. Prejudices sub- siding. The inference to be drawn from the fact that the average amount of work performed by each operator steadily increases each year, is that prejudices are subsiding and obstacles disappearing. Two chief obstacles to be encountered. There are two chief obstacles which are encountered almost everywhere throughout the Presidency,52 VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. [Part II. vaccination is becoming more popular year by year. The very worst form of opposition met with is due to natural prejudice, fostered by the interested in- oculators who dread losing the means of earning their bread after the manner of their forefathers. The following extract describes the attitude of the people in the newly formed Eastern Bengal circle, and may be taken as representing fairly the ordinary state of feeling which has to be encountered in the first, or wholly uneducated stage of the populationPart II.] VACCINATION IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 53 Lymph supply for Bengal. and sufficient supply of lymph. The supply for the Province of Bengal was, as hitherto, derived chiefly from Calcutta; but in isolated intances, other sources were drawn upon,54 VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL. [Part II. lymph to commence the season with. English lymph procured viâ Bombay was distributed in tubes to some districts, and for the most part proved effectual. Hyderabad. The Hyderabad supply was late. The supply of lymph asked for did not arrive from England till after the season had com- menced. I was therefore obliged to begin work with a small supply received from Bombay. This I did at Akolah, and as it increased, sent out vaccinators to their various stations, but as the lymph had in many instances to be sent long distances, when tried, it proved a failure, and thus retarded work at the beginning of the season. Oudh. Oudh, which also receives its lymph from England, suffered in the same way from delay. VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL. General results. In the following statement are detailed the particulars of vaccine operations throughout the province for the season 1873-74 in comparison with the five pre- vious years. Notwithstanding the very satisfactory increase of 1,04,228 cases upon the previous year, the total number of operations performed only amounts to about one-third of the estimated birth-rate.

56 VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL. [Part II. Agency increased. As compared with the previous season, the staff was increased by the addition of 38 vaccinators, 42 apprentices, and 21 ex-inoculators. The in- crease in the unpaid agency is due to the increased interest manifested by the civil surgeons in the matter, whilst the addition to the regular establishment was caused chiefly by the necessities of the Darjeeling and Eastern Bengal circles. Comparison with previous years. The number of operations performed during the last 10 years is exhibited in the statement below, which shows a rapidly increasing progressive rate. The returns of the vaccine circles are trustworthy, but those of the dispensary establishment are not so reliable for lack of the means of supervision. The work done by the former agency amounted to 573,170 cases, or 72.3 per cent. of the whole. The percentage of success of primary vaccinations does not show such a high rate as in the previous year, but the greater pains which were taken to check and supervise the work of the dispensary and municipal vaccinators was clearly the cause of this. In the season 1872-73 the percent- age of successful cases in dispensary vaccination was 89.3, whereas in the year under report it was 79.12. STATEMENT No. XI. YEARS. Operations. YEARS.

Cost of vaccination. The budget grant for vaccination for the official year amounted to Rs. 99,800, and the actual disbursements were Rs. 88,310, being an increase of Rs. 6,104 over the expenditure of 1872-73. On account of the large number of persons vaccinated, the cost of each successful case has fallen from 2 annas and 5 pie to 2 annas only. Dispensary vaccinations were conducted at the rate of 10 pie each successful case. In Calcutta the cost was 8 annas each. The Ranchee circle maintains its rather high rate of 5 annas, while the other circles are more consistent in their approach to the general average. Calcutta and Suburbs. Reduction in estab- lishment. Calcutta and Suburbs.Part II.] VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL. 57 Importation was the cause. The utmost vigilance and the most prompt measures for protecting all those who resided around the infected spots effec- tually prevented anything like an epidemic, if, indeed, such an occurrence is possible in Calcutta in its highly protected state. Dr. Charles has no doubt that the city passed through a season which, before vaccination had controlled the disease, " would have been one in which the sacrifice of human life would have been immense." Proposed addition to the Circle. It is proposed in the report to add to the metropolitan circles the four surrounding districts of Midnapore, Bankoora, Beerbhoom and Jessore, with an additional superintendent. The Surgeon-General supports the suggestion, but declines to recommend increased expenditure during a period of financial pres- sure. Dr. Charles shows that Calcutta is directly influenced by those districts, in the two first-named of which an attempt is being made to organize the local ex-inoculators, whilst the superintendent of the metropolitan circles has volunteered to take charge of Jessore without additional establishment; but Beerbhoom58 VACCINATION IN THE PROVINCE OF BENGAL.

Explanation of the falling off in results. Regarding the falling off in the number of operations, Dr. Lidderdale ex- plains that this " arises from vaccination to suppress small-pox having been practised only in 4,976 cases in the hot weather of 1873, against 13,935 in that of 1872. This steady decline of hot-weather vaccination indicates that the operations of the department are being followed by a great diminution of small-pox in this circle." Darjeeling as a depôt for lymph supply. The report discusses the possibility of constituting the Darjeeling Hills a source of lymph supply, and it is rendered tolerably plain that, owing to the scantiness of the population at a sufficient height, these hills can never be made to occupy the place, with regard to Bengal, that Kumaon and Ghurwal fulfil for the North-Western Provinces.

The men were divided into five gangs; the head man of each gang divided his men into batches, consisting of one experienced man and a couple of novices, and a group of villages was assigned to each batch, which was not allowed to enter any new village till the work allotted to it had been completed. The head vaccinator inspected the work of each batch every fifth or sixth day. Sickness interfered somewhat with the work in all the thanas, but more especially in Manickgunge and Jaffergunge. Prejudices. The prejudices of the people presented some obstructions, but clearly there are no deep-rooted objections to vaccination. Instruction to inoculators. An effort was made to instruct inoculators, who in this circle are chiefly Chandals and Mallakors, with but ill success ; indeed only one man was en- rolled and he proved to be apathetic.

The figures for Bundlecund, though incorporated in the statement, do not properly belong to the province, in that vaccination in that State is conducted by a purely local agency unconnected with the department, which, however, exercises its supervision so far as its more legitimate duties will permit. Agency. The agency was strengthened by the addition of 27 vaccinators, of whom 17 were furnished from municipal or local sources, and the expense of the remainder was met by Government. Sufficiency of vac- cination to the wants of the province. The total number vaccinated was 492,687, or 55,257 more than in 1872-73. Excluding Bundlecund, the Superintendent-General calculates the percentage successfully vaccinated, assuming a birth-rate of 30 per 1,000 in a population of 30,781,204, on the birth addition of 923,433, to be 38.68, or an increase of 2.58 per cent. over the previous year. The Government resolution, however, points out that this birth-rate " is certainly too low;" and that . the last half yearly infanticide returns, which extend over a considerable population, and are believed to be very fairly correct, give an annual birth-rate of 38.4 per thousand, and all the returns and information before Government point to a birth-rate more like 40 than 30 per thousand." In future reports an assumed birth-rate of 40 per 1,000 is enjoined. The provincial jail report shows that 3.8 per cent. of the jail population of the year had been vaccinated. Ratio of success. Work per vaccinator. The ratio of success has fallen of slightly in primary cases, whilst in re- vaccinations an improvement is manifested by a decrease of 7.10 in the percent- age of success. The average monthly number of operations performed by each vaccinator increased by 11.6 over last year. The Government vaccinators performed the greatest amount of work per man (292 cases monthly), but the highest figure of success is attributed to the municipal establishment. Infant vaccination. The percentage of vaccination of children under one year of age is ex- ceedingly favourable in these provinces as compared with Bengal. During the year under review no less than 22.7 per cent. of primary cases were under one year, whereas in Bengal only 6 per cent. were under that age; but in the case of the latter province it is not stated whether only primary cases are included. The percentage of children vaccinated varied from 24 to 27 in all the circles except Benares, which gave only 8.9 per cent. The small propor- tion in Benares is attributed to the fact, that the feeling against inoculating children who are under one year has survived; and the idea is applied to vaccination. Caste of the vaccina- ted. As to caste, the proportion per cent. of those primarily vaccinated was as follows :64 VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. [Part II Kumaon division. Results. Kumaon division of the Kumaon and Rohilcund circle.Part II.] VACCINATION IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. 65 Results. During the season the establishment consisted of 114 persons, two vaccina- tors having been added to it. The total number vaccinated was 90,206, being an increase of 19,280. The percentage of success in primary cases was 82.6, or almost precisely the same as the former year, and each vaccinator performed 189 operations per mensem. The percentage of females among those primarily vaccinated was 49.24, and of those under one year of age 23.30. Attitude of people The zillahs of Cawnpore, Futtehpore, Hameerpore and Jounpore showed greater readiness to accept vaccination than the other districts of the circle, and Jhansi occupies the lowest position of all. Small-pox. On account of the prevalence of small-pox, four vaccinators were tempora- rily entertained in Ozai in March, and the return of their work has been included in the general record. The total number of deaths from small-pox in the circle was 9,407 against 1,876 for 1872-73. Benares circle. Results. The Benares circle.66 VACCINATION IN THE PUNJAB. [Part II.

68 VACCINATION IN THE PUNJAB. [Part II. Work of regular es- tablishment. Work of dispensary establishment. The work performed by the regular vaccine establishment shows an in- crease over the previous year of 61,546 cases; the percentage of success was slightly increased, and the cost fell to 2 annas and 7 pie from 3 annas and 1 pie. The operations of the dispensary establishment have for the past two years shown a decrease ; but the percentage of success and the cost have diminished satisfactorily. To a great extent the increase of municipal and local vaccinations is accounted for by the increased facilities for vaccination afforded by municipa and local committees and by Native States. By these latter agencies a largel excess (46,083 cases) of work upon the results of the former year was done. The grand total of all work was 101,750 in excess of the number of the previous year. A deputy superin- tendent added to the establishment. General facts. In December sanction was given to the entertainment of a native deputy superintendent, to whom tehseels in the Kangra district were allotted.

General results. Local establishments. Results. Vaccination in these provinces is carried on by a small provincial establish- ment paid from provincial fund, and local establishments paid from municipal and district funds. The former has not undergone any change, but the latter has been increased a little as shown by this statement. The whole agency is under the immediate superintendence of the civil surgeons of districts, the prin- ciple laid down for guidance being, that no more work is to be attempted than can be efficiently overlooked by the civil, medical, or other trustworthy officer. The number of operations performed by the provincial establishment was 41,265, being nearly 4,000 less than the number vaccinated by the establishment in the previous year, but the deficiency occurred in the Seoni district only, and was due to a large portion of the district, containing a third of its inhabitants, having been transferred to Balaghat. The percentage of success was 93.5. Local and municipal establishments performed 89,734 operations against 77,074 in the previous year, with a percentage of success in primary cases of 87.77. Sufficiency of vacci- nation to the wants of the province. Touching the sufficiency of vaccination, as at present conducted, to the wants of the province, Dr. Townsend writes :72 VACCINATION IN OUDH.

It is satisfactory to note that the number of operations increased from 19,170 to 30,409 with almost exactly the same establishment and at a decreased total cost, and consequently a very marked decrease in the cost per head. With the exception of the districts of Seetapore and Hurdui, the increase in the amount of work done was common to all parts of the province. The percent- age of success among primary cases has fallen off slightly, but the success attained in re-vaccination is recorded at a but slightly lower figure. This would lead to the suspicion, as Dr. Sutherland observes, that some misunder- standing exists. Lymph supply. Owing to the supply of vaccine material from England not arriving in proper time, vaccine operations were delayed at the commencement of the season, and the first crop of vesicles through which vaccination was set on foot sprang from material obtained from the Superintendent-General of the North-Western Provinces. The crusts preserved from the previous season all proved failures. Operations per vacci- nator. Infant vaccinations. Caste. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator has risen from 355 to 553; and the ratio of infants vaccinated rose from one-fourth to one-third of the total number.

The system of vaccination pursued has remained the same, with the exception of the season 1871-72, when the " itinerant method" was tried. " It consists of concentrating the work around certain centres with the two-fold object of having it under close supervision, and therefore likely to be well done, and of illustrating the utility of the process by reducing the prevalence of small-pox in small and well-protected areas." There are now 12 cen- tres : one at the head-quarters of each district, and the number of vaccinators at each station varies from 3 to 6, not including Lucknow, where there are 11 of the most inexperienced hands. Each centre has a radius of 10 miles. Resolution of Local Government. The Chief Commissioner, in commenting on the report, expresses his con- gratulations on the marked improvement which the results of the past show on those of the preceding year. VACCINATION IN RAJPOOTANA. General results. The results of the year's work are represented in thefollowing statement:Part II.] VACCINATION IN BRITISH BURMAH. 75 The following table shows the progress of vaccination in Rajpootana from its commence- ment at intervals of five years :76 VACCINATION IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS. [Part II. Results. Reason of peculiari- ties of results. The vaccinator at the head-quarters of each district is directly under the district civil surgeon, who is expected to examine the work of the vaccinator and promote vaccination in the circle to the utmost of his power. The statement below shows that fewer people were vaccinated; that the number of successful cases has diminished by 3,802 and the number of unsuccessful cases increased by 2,071; and the percentage of success has fallen. The numbers returned as " unknown" were less than in the previous year (2,545 against 3,317). The reasons assigned for these differences are the non-arrival in proper time of the supply of lymph from England; the use of indifferent lymph procured from Bombay, which gave rise to a large number of failures ; the excessively severe epidemic of small-pox which prevailed; the greater supervision exercised by superintendents, and consequently, more cor- rect recording of results; and the promulgation of an order prohibiting the vaccinators from carrying on work in towns where there are dispensaries.

Bombay lymph. Arrangements are being made to ensure the future arrival of a proper supply of lymph from England early in the year. Dr. Abbot desires to begin work in the middle of September, so that the vesicle may be well established by 1st October, and lymph distributed from the districts. The Bombay lymph used, when it did not end in failures, produced vesicles of puny appearance from which material could not be collected. Supervision. Supervision by superintendents was much more efficiently performed than in 1872-73. Vaccinators prohi- bited from working in towns where there are dispensaries. The object of the order prohibiting vaccinators from operating in towns where there are dispensaries was to avail as much as possible of the services of the hospital assistants attached to those institutions, and though the superintendent admits that the order has had the effect of diminishing the number of cases, he does not purpose for the present to cancel the order. Small-pox. Small-pox caused 8,326 deaths in 1873. It appears that the province has been undergoing an epidemic for some years, which only reached its height in June. Infant vaccinations. The number of operations performed on children under one year of age was 31 per cent. of the whole against 17 per cent. in the previous year, and this must be regarded as a favorable omen. The sexes were pretty evenly divided. Sexes and castes of the vaccinated. The ratios per cent of individuals vaccinated according to caste, as com- pared with other years, are thus stated. Mahommedans were found to be the most difficult to manage, and Rajpoots nearly equally so. They do not offer active opposition, but they decline to bring their children forward. CASTES.

With a similar establishment and fewer subjects operated on, the average cost of each successful case has been raised from 7 annas to 9 annas and 9 pie. Resident's resolution. The Resident at Hyderabad expresses his satisfaction at the results of the year, and considers that, notwithstanding diminished numbers, a fair amount of progress has been made.

It is urged in the report of the Central Provinces, that the number of out-door patients is the best gauge of the usefulness and popularity of a dispensary, and in this opinion the Deputy Surgeon-General of the Sagar Circle coincides ; "and" he adds, "the number of admissions or new cases is a better test of the increase or decrease of popularity than the daily average number of sick." Doubtful accuracy of some returns. Accuracy of the Punjab returns. It is greatly to be regretted that the Inspectors-General of Dispensaries of the North-Western and the Central Provinces have found cause to express themselves as being very sceptical as to the accuracy and truthfulness of the returns of these Provinces. These doubts are not, however, confirmed by any observations contained in the inspection reports of the Deputy Surgeons-General, whilst the Inspector-General of Punjab Dispensaries considers the returns of his Province to be eminently reliable.

It cannot be said that the wishes of Government have not received earnest attention, and that everything possible has not been done to attain success. So deeply is the Surgeon-General im- pressed with the futility of further efforts, that he declines to recommend con- tinued action on the present system, while he lends his support to a scheme originated by the Principal of the Medical College, Calcutta, on the profession of midwifery, which aims at the systematic instruction of a high class of well educated women. The attempt to utilize the hereditary dhai has proved utterly hopeless. At Allahabad, Dr. Irving, by every means in his power, endea- voured to awaken the interest of the native community in the matter, but he could not. At Jubbulpore, a hospital assistant is employed to instruct a class, and, according to the civil surgeon, it would seem that some small amount of suc- cess was attained. The midwifery school at Amritsur, of which an account will be found further on, is the only institution of the kind which promises moderate success, and the reason would seem to be that the old attempt to instruct dhais is not included in its programme, but rather are the principles, of which the Surgeon-General approves, worked upon. High caste Hindu females of good character are placed under the immediate supervision of a competent European matron, and are instructed by the civil surgeon and his assistant.

The increase of the dispensaries in British Burmah shows a vast decrease upon the amount of the previous year; but the reason is, that in 1872 a sum approaching a lakh of rupees was granted for buildings in Rangoon. The Hyderabad expenditure was, unlike the previous year, within the income, and the receipts from Government were less. There is a pretty general growing conviction that localities should officially accept a very much larger share in the support of their dispensaries than is at present the case; indeed, it is apparent in this, as in many other matters, that Government can but develop a system to demonstration in the eyes of the people who must at that point assume its further charge. It does, indeed, seem but reasonable that Government should be relieved by the localities which benefit, of the cost of drugs at least, as well as of diet charges and such like. The views of the Punjab Government are expressed thus:Part III.] HOSPITALS AND DISPENSARIES IN THE BENGAL PRESIDENCY. 85 Dispensaries as training institutions. Deputy Surgeon-General C. R.

Indeed, the Chandney Hospital returns an increase of imported primary syphilis which alone goes far towards explaining the total rise. In 1872 that hospital returned only 207 imported cases of primary syphilis and 200 indigenous; in 1873 there were 86 indigenous cases and 524 contracted out of the limits of the Act. Taking, for the sake of just comparison, only those institutions in which the locality of infection has been recorded, we arrive at the following statement:Part III.] MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. 91 Number treated in each department.

The death-rate of the past three years is given in statement No. XVI, arranged according to sex and class. Of the 4,203 in-door patients treated (ex- cluding eye cases) 540 proved fatal, being a mortality of 128.5 per mille against 115.8 in 1872 and 126.28 in 1871; but 110 of these deaths occurred in less than 24 hours after admission. Excluding, then, these moribund cases, the death- rate would be reduced to 105.5 per 1,000 of the treated against 90.9 for 1872 and 106.2 for 1871. There was a greater mortality in 1873 than during 1872, but it was below that of every other year since 1863. Reviewing the subject according to sex and class, the Surgeon-General observes :92 THE PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. [ Part III. Surgical operations. Results affected by '' hospitalism." There were 189 surgical operations performed (see table No. 6 appended), but of these only 163 were treated to a termination with 49 deaths, or a morta- lity rate of 300.6 per 1,000, a much higher rate than has been recorded during the previous 11 years for which statistics are given. But nearly half of these deaths were due to " hospitalism." Osteo-myelitis, which had not been seen in the hospital for several years, was diagnosed in two cases. The years 1870, 1871, and 1872, Dr. Chevers points out, were characterised by a decrease in the number of deaths from causes with which the word " hospitalism" has recently been associated; but " last year, just at the very time when it was fair to expect that the co-operative influence of these several improvements'' (a supply of good water, new latrines, improved drainage, segregation of the sick and the systematic introduction of the antiseptic treatment, all of which had been brought into use within the above period) " would act most perceptibly in lowering the rate of surgical mortality, septicæmia increases, and osteo-myelitis re-appear." Dr. Chevers shows, however, that two great causes of septicæmia and its allies still continue in force, viz., a city atmosphere and the imperfect separation of medical from surgical cases; and finally, he regards the year as having been an epidemic period. Improvements im. pending. Government has granted 6 lakhs of rupees for the improvement of the school and hospital, and estimates and plans are being drawn up. Amongst other things, it is intended to erect a new surgical hospital, and thus to remove one of the most glaring defects, the mixing up of medical and surgical cases. Training midwives. " Another year's experience of the attempt to train native dhais as mid. wives has, I much regret to say," observes the Surgeon-General, " been the reverse of favourable.'' Finances. The finances of the hospital have been economically administered, large savings having been effected on the budget allowance under several heads. Surgeon-General's approbation of the management. The Surgeon-General concludes his remarks by observing that the success- ful management of this large and important institution reflects great credit upon its able Principal, and the staff of medical officers associated with him." THE PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. The hospital staff remained as during the previous year. Surgeon-Major J. Ewart, M. D., submitted a very elaborate and interesting report. Duties of the staff. Each of the three buildings which constitute the hospital is under the charge of one of the three officers who compose the medical staff, and to each is attached separate establishments, cook-rooms, &c. Transfer of the pa- tients of the Sumbhoo Nath Pandit's Hospi- tal to the General Hospital. The sphere of usefulness of the institution was increased during the year by the transfer, under the orders of the Lieutenant-Governor, with the consent of the governing body, of the in-door department of the Sumbhoo Nath Pundit's Hospital to the General Hospital. This new ward provided accom- modation for 25 native patients, and already its utility has been demon- strated. Number treated. Death-rate. Cholera. Cholera amongst the shipping. The total number of patients treated underwent a diminution of 720 as compared with the previous year, but the difference was due to the epidemic of dengue which prevailed in 1872. It will, however, be observed from statement No. XVII, that the number is in excess of any of the years 1867 to 1871 inclusive. So with the mortality; in only one year, viz., 1871, when it was 36.52, per thou- sand, has the death-rate been so low as it was last year, 38.9; and this holds good whether cholera be included or excluded. The cholera death-rate, 339.6 per 1,000, was less than in any of the previous eight years, and the actual number of cases treated (53) was also fewer (except in 1871) than any year within that period. These results, which contrast strongly with the facts observed at the Medical College, are accounted for by Dr. Ewart by the improved sanitary condition of the river bank and the earlier removal of patients to hospital. Dr. Ewart attributes the occurrence of cholera amongst the shipping chiefly to the in- sanitary condition of the river bank; it is therefore satisfactory to know that the construction of an embankment along the face of the Hooghly, which Dr. Ewart has urged for years, is being carried out by the Port Commis- sioners.

Deputy Surgeon-General H. B. Buckle, C. B., in forwarding the report, expresses his entire approval with the manner in which the Presidency General Hospital is conducted. THE CALCUTTA HOPSITAL NURSES' INSTITUTION. Usefulness of the nurses' institution. The two hospitals whose working has just been described are greatly indebted to this institution, which has regularly supplied them with a superior class of nurses, and meets all the expenses of salaries, &c. A special effort so far increased the funds at the disposal of the ladies' committee as to have enabled it to give three additional nurses to the General Hospital. Alto- gether there are now thirteen nurses and a matron supported by the institution in the two hospitals. Both Dr. Chevers and Dr. Ewart bear testimony to the very great assistance they have received in this important matter of nursing from the institution.

Medical Institutions;" but in addition to the regular provincial dispensaries, there were no less than 109 temporary or endemic dispensaries established to meet the wants of fever-stricken localities (70 such dispensaries were worked in Burdwan, 17 in Beerbhoom, 16 in Midnapore and 6 in Hooghly). Thus al- together there were in the province, including the metropolitan hospitals, 318 institutions of all sorts maintained for the medical relief of the sick poor. Fifteen of the newly established dispensaries were constituted under class III of the new rules, and under the old classification would have been termed "branch" dispensaries, one was under class VII and is a sub-divisional dispensary, and thirteen were established under special conditions in classes IV or I, and may be considered as " main" dispensaries. Proportion of institutions treating in-door patients. Medical establish- ment. Returns were received from 188 of the 198 provincial dispensaries, and of the former, 136, or 72 per cent., treated in-door patients, against 114 or 68 per cent. in 1872. Of the dispensaries which treated in-door patients, 67, or 49.3 per cent., treated less, and 69, or 50.7 per cent., more than 100 patients, figures which show a distinct advance upon the previous year. As regards out-door patients, 84 per cent. treated more than 1,000 patients in the course of the year, against 74.4 per cent. in 1872, and five dispensaries treated more than 10,000 patients. There were 49 assistant surgeons, 49 hospital assist- ants and 98 native doctors, besides a medical missionary at Hiranpore, and a house surgeon at Dacca, in charge of dispensaries. Total 198, against 170 in 1872. The chief increase took place in the native doctor class.

In September last, on receipt of the expressed wish of Government that the experiment should be further continued, as conveyed in letter No. 1240 of 25th March 137.3, from the Secretary to Government, Home Department, a new class was formed at the medical college, and six pupils were obtained; but on its being discovered that all were Christians, two vacancies were kept open, in order, if posssible, to procure Mussulman or Hindu females. Not a single woman of either class, however, came forward, and it was ultimately found necessary to fill up the two vacancies with Christians. The class thus formed was, in March of the current year, invited to submit to an examination, and three out of the six presented themselves. One was found to be completely ignorant and failed, the other two made a creditable appearance, and obtained certificates to practise. This amount of success, therefore, so far as it goes, has only reference to the class of Native Christians who are without strong prejudices, and who have received some education ; but the object of Government is not attained by this. Dr. Chevers, the Principal of the medical college, and Dr. Charles, the professor of obstetric medicine, are still, as they have been from the first, opposed to teaching at the college the low standard of education desired for these women, viz., a little better training than what is possessed by those practising as dhais, who are guided solely by their own experience and native tradition. They would prefer to carry out an elaborate course of obstetric instruction by having well-educated women as pupils, who would eventually turn out highly educated midwives. They may aim too high; still I am of opinion that their views indicate the direction in which this experiment should, if possible, be carried out. It would appear, however, that the only likely way in which pupils of respectable character and class, and who have received at least the rudiments of education, can be obtained, is through the influence of district officers and the assistance of native gentlemen of position. Govern- ment has accordingly taken steps to obtain the co-operation of district officers and native land- owners for this object, with what result still remains to be seen. It will evidently take time to overcome native prejudices, traditions, and customs, so as to persuade a new and better class of women to take the place of the low caste menial race of professional dhais ; and as child-birth in this country is, for the most part, a comparatively simple process, requiring no interference, save only in very exceptional instances, the necessity for this movement may not perhaps easily commend itself to the minds of even the more enlightened natives. Still, as medical education generally, in accordance with European ideas, has come to be now not only accepted, but to be even sought after in spite of all early prejudices and opposition, so it may, I think, be expected that in the end a fair measure of success will attend efforts made to educate respectable women in a useful and competent knowledge of practical midwifery. The progress at first will be slow, but this should not cause discouragement or lead to the abandonment of the scheme until, at any rate, it has had a few years' longer trial. At Moorshedabad and Hooghly, attempts in the same direction have been made, but with no better success. The civil surgeons of Monghyr and Purulia, too. made some efforts, but report utter failure. Altogether there were 136 cases of labour treated in the dispensaries of the province during the year; it is therefore a difficult matter to understand the source whence practical instruction is to be obtained. Of the 47 dispen- saries in which confinements took place, the highest total was 14 at Moorshe- dabad. At Dacca there were 12. In 4 dispensaries there were 7 confinements : in 2 there were 5, in 3 there were 4, in 8 there were 3, in 8 there were 2, and in the remainder only 1 confinement took place in each. Grant-in-aid rules, The newly established grant-in-aid rules were in operation throughout the year, and they certainly seem to have exercised a beneficial influence financially. Meteorology. A sketch of the meteorology of the year is included in the Surgeon. General's report to Government. It need here be simply noted that the charac- teristics of the year were an abnormally high atmospheric pressure in Eastern Bengal, unsteady easterly winds, late arrival and early cessation of the mon- soon, and a very deficient rainfall. Public health. The year was not a particularly sickly one, though cholera prevailed to a greater extent than in 1872, and it was endemic all over the province, but its outbreaks were not violent. Small-pox, too, was more than usually prevalent. Measles appeared in the districts of Burdwan, Bankoora and Dacca. The endemic fever of Burdwan, Midnapore and Beerbhoom has continued, though it is believed not so virulently or extensively. It extended itself to the west of the district past its former boundary. Dr. French, whose report in extenso will be found in the Surgeon-General's report to the Bengal Government, believes after thorough investigation that the disease is a malarious fever of an unusually fatal character.

The Government scheme of selling a few medicines in small quantities and at cheap rates to the poor was persisted in, and the following statement exhibits with what results:Part III.] DISPENSARIES IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. 101 Medical establish- ment. This shows a real and satisfactory increase as regards the number of dispensaries, but the figures which indicate the amount of relief given require some explanation. It will be observed that there was an increase of 1,055 in-door patients over 1872; of this increase only 71 are due to the 13 new institutions. So far it is satisfactory as showing that the older institutions had become more popular; but it would seem that the increase was in police cases, the actual number of voluntary in-door patients really having slightly dimin- ished. On the other hand, the increase (3,206) in the attendance of out- patients was entirely due to the work of the new dispensaries; the number of cases treated in the old dispensaries decreased by 20,025, and this result is attributed to the general healthiness of the year. The average attendance of out-patients in all the dispensaries, old and new, decreased by a little over two per cent. At the close of the year, there were 34 assistant surgeons and 118 hospital assistants employed in the working of the dispensaries :102 DISPENESARIES IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. [Part III.

The civil surgeon of Agra in his report makes the following observation, which, no doubt, other medical officers could confirm; yet it is much to be desired that the subject be not lost sight of, and it must be admitted that there is room for increased exertion on the part of medical officers in the field of operation,104 DISPENSARIES IN THE NOHTH-WESTERN PROVINCES.

I might quote from the mortuary registers of the circles in and around Meerut evidence of the increase of malarial diseases which accompanied this rise of the spring-level and satura- tion of the subsoil, but I prefer to extract the figures required from the hospital registers of the central prison, regarding the correctness of which there can be no doubt.

Of the total treated, the proportion of the sexes has hardly varied at all in the years 1872 and 1873. In the former of these years 24.5 per cent. of the whole were females, and in 1873 the ratio was 24.7.

This is not a high rate, but among the dis- pensaries of some of the districts the rate has been high, as, for instance, Muzaffargarh 21.43, Bannu 19.82, Derah Ismail Khan 18.42, Abbottábád 17.74, Sirsa 17.64, Kángra 17.24 and others. I have tried to see whether any reliable information as to the geographical distribution of stone in the bladder could be obtained from these figures, but without success; for instance, Simla, Derah Gházi Khán and Derah Ismail Khán would appear to have most stone; but it is more than probable that some, if not many, of the cases noted against these districts came from other parts, perhaps some distance beyond British territory. Female education in midwifery. A special report upon the working of the Umritsur midwifery school was submitted to the local Government during the year, and an institution having similar objects in view was established at Delhi by the Society for the Propaga- tion of the Gospel. The Inspector-General of dispensaries writes as follows concerning their endeavours to teach midwifery to respectable native women :108 DISPENSARIES IN THE PUNJAB. [Part III. The plans for a new school-room, matron's quarters, and lying-in-wards for a few cases of difficult labour, have been decided on, and a site has also been selected for the building, so that it may be expected that before very long a proper set of buildings will be provided. Two European pupils, who were mentioned in the report for 1872 as attending, were examined by, and received certificates from, the professor of midwifery in the Lahore medical school. At the close of 1873 there were five European pupils attending. During the year there were 605 cases of labour attended at the homes of the women, and 27 were attended in the hospital; this gives an increase of 159 among the former, and 9 among the latter description of patients, as compared with the figures for 1872. These figures speak well for the progress the institution is making. Of the cases, 5 required instrumental interference, 11 were cases of turning, 47 abortions, and 25 miscarriages. Mrs. Hankin's success in attending to the pupils and the practice of the institution are sufficiently shown by the figures I have just given; whilst the civil surgeon, Dr. Mackenzie, continues his careful supervision of the working of the institution, and bestows considerable time and trouble in teaching the pupils. At Delhi a midwifery class has been established at St. Stephen's College by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel; it is aided by a monthly grant of Rs. 75 from municipal funds. It has 14 pupils, who are under the instruction of an advanced pupil of the Bareilly school. The assistant surgeon frequently, and the civil surgeon occasionally, inspect and examine the class.

Hakeems were employed in the districts of Jhelum, Sialkot, Delhi and Goor. goan, but it does not appear that any real benefit is derived from their services, and the popularity of the measure is subsiding to reasonable proportions. Inspection duties of civil surgeons. It is stated that, on the whole, the inspection duties of civil surgeons have been fairly attended to, but in several instances the orders of Government re- garding dispensary committees were not carried out. Lahore medical school. Two students passed their final examination at the Lahore medical school during the year, and there were 3 admissions to the school; the total number of students remaining at the end of the year was 15. Finances. There was a very considerable falling off (Rs. 27,112) in the amount of sub- scriptions collected from natives. The Inspector-General of Dispensaries thinks that the increase of income from municipal funds (Rs. 23,870) in some way explains this unfavourable result, in that native gentlemen are apt to think, when they see funds coming liberally from local sources, that there is no need for their liberality. It must, however, be recorded that the bulk of the decrease appears to be owing to the fact that the subscriptions of 1872 included the donation of Rs. 21,000 from His Highness the Maharaja of Cashmere. The Government contribution was increased by Rs. 5,122. The expenditure underwent increase under every head except on account of European medi- cines supplied by Government (Rs. 733), but there was a very large increase (Rs. 5,580) in the expenditure for European medicines from the dispensary funds ; the general increase is accounted for by the increase of patients. The balance in hand at the end of the year was Rs 41,620. Endowment funds. The Inspector General of dispensaries strongly advocates the creation of endowment funds, as he considers that the time must come when the dispensaries will be thrown entirely on local sources of income and private charity. Cost of medicines. In commenting on the increased expenditure, His Honor the Lieutenant. Governor expresses his opinion that the time has come when the cost of European medicines may be charged to the district in which the dispensary is situated. Apropos of this subject in his comment upon the working of the branch dispensaries in the Sialkot district, the Inspector-General of Dispensaries observes as follows:Part III,] DISPENSARIES IN THE PUNJAB. 109 of European medicines." It appears to me that the first cause is resultant from the second and third, and that the remedy for these lie in the hands of the local authorities, civil and medical, to whom I appeal for action towards removing the evils pointed out. Desirability of employing a superior class of medical subordinate. These remarks very clearly point to the desirability of employing a more highly educated class of medical officer to take charge of branch dispensaries, and to the necessity of increased liberality on the part of the native public. In these views the Punjab Government participates, and expresses its opinion in paragraph 2 of the resolution on the report, showing practically the direction in which the remedies are to be sought:110 DISPENSARIES IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. [Part III. exceed the total of the sums paid under the existing system by which the salaries are fixed in each appointment, and it not unfrequently happens that a young 3rd class hospital assistant, who is only entitled to Rs. 20 as the pay of his rank, draws Rs. 40, or double the pay of his rank. To the unsystematic employment of Baids and Hakeems, Dr. Tresid. der strongly objects, but he thinks they might be probably employed if first instructed at the local dispensary, and obliged to pass some sort of minor examination; " but" he adds, " no effort should be spared in trying to secure the sons of these men being sent to our medical schools for training". The practice of treating the police sick in dispensaries is very strongly objected to for obvious reasons. DISPENSARIES IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. Surgeon-Major J. F. Baxter officiated as Inspector-General of dispen- saries and submitted the report. Number of institutions. New buildings. At the close of the year there were 78 medical institutions in operation. A new dispensary was opened in the fortress of Asirgurh, and one was closed in the Raipur district. The new city hospital buildings at Jabalpore and Nagpore made satisfactory progress. Other original works in progress were the city dispensary at Burhanpur, and a dispensary at Gudarwara. Number treated. A grand total of 3,21,987 persons were treated, an increase on the number of the previous year of over 2.5 per cent., and, observes the Chief Commissioner, " This increase occurring, as it does, in a year in which the public health was good, and in which the price of ordinary food grains was in the three divisions of the province cheaper than in the previous year, so that disease was not aggravated by want, seems a fair and adequate proof that our dispensaries are becoming more and more appreciated, and that the prejudices in favor of native methods of treatment are gradually disappearing. Sex of those treated. Both sexes participated in this increase, but there was a falling off of no less than 6.6 per cent. in the attendance of house-patients as compared with 1872. The reason of this does not very clearly appear in the report, though in the case of each dispensary which exhibits a decrease some local cause, sometimes far-fetched, is assigned. The total number of in-door patients who were treated was 9,763, and of out-door 312,224. The aggregated total re- presents a proportion of 4.4 per cent. of the total population, a ratio far in advance of any other province save the Punjab. Diseases treated. Fewer persons were treated for fevers and bowel complaints, and the Sanitary Commissioner's returns show that these ailments were less prevalent than usual. Only 84 cases of small-pox were treated, though the affection pre- vailed severely. Dengue gave 1,047 admissions, rheumatism 16,609, and diseases of the eye and of the respiratory organs contributed a large quota. Classification of operations. Notwithstanding the very precise instructions which have from time to time been issued by the head of the medical department, it is unsatisfactory to observe that diversity of practice regarding the classification of operations under the heads of major and minor still exists; for instance, some civil sur- geons have excluded both the " reduction of dislocations" and the " setting of fractures,'' whilst others have retained the one and rejected the other, and a third set have included both; so with the "removal of tumours," extreme latitude seems to have been taken, for, as Dr. Baxter observes, as some of these tumours weighed but half an ounce, it is presumed their removal did not constitute what is termed a "major operation." Table No. 1 exhibits 392 major operations as having been performed in the Central Provinces during the year, but, writes the Inspector-General of DispensariesPart III.] DISPENSARIES IN THE CENTRAL PROVINCES. 111 Fifteen cases of the whole were unsuccessful, 4 each at Nagpore and Raipur, 2 each at Nursinghpur, Nimar and Sumbulpore, and 1 at Wardha; 11,682 minor operations were performed, or 584 less than the previous year's returns; of these 76 are shown as unsuc- cessful; of the latter Sagor gives 66, but no explanation is given in the report regarding this large number. It is much to be regretted and it is difficult to conceive how so much confusion existed in the face of the explicit instructions which have been departmentally issued. In commenting upon the remarks which have been above extracted, the Chief Commissioner observes :112 DISPENSARIES IN OUDH. [Part III.

With the exception of this very brief and imperfect information, the report contains nothing further bearing on the point. Diseases treated. Of the diseases treated, skin-diseases were the most numerous and formed 18 per cent. of the total; fevers formed 15 per cent.; diseases of the abdomen (whatever that may mean) gave 11 per cent.

There is generally a great craving for cold water, which may be given in any quantity; never mind if the patient vomits, as reaction proceeds he will retain it.

The total number of medical institutions was 73 from which reports were received. Of these, 8 belong to British Rajpootana, 2 to the Rajpootana Public Works Department, 1 to the Inland Customs Department, and the remaining 62 to the Native States.

The total number of patients treated was 174,576 against 182,090 during 1872, being a decrease (common to all the dispensaries) of 7,514, a result which is attributed to the absence of epidemic diseases, notably cholera and dengue, which prevailed in 1872. This total does not include the patients treated in the Jeypoor and Khetree institutions from which no re- ports were received for 1872 and 1873, "but supposing the same number of patients to have been treated in Jeypoor and Khetree in 1873, as for the last year for which reports were received (viz. 1871), the grand total of pa- tients for the province would be 206,741." Of the actual total, 150,593 were treated in the institutions of Native States, and 23,983 in British States. Of the total number treated in the Native States, 3,540 were patients from the various jails (vide para. 23), and of the total number treated in British Raj. pootana, 464 were jail patients. Cost. The total cost was Rs. 44,776, and the cost per patient a little more than four annas, both figures being a little in excess of the previous year. Diseases treated.

In the resolution of the local Government, the establishment of new hospitals at the seaports of Moulmein and Akyab for Europeans is regarded as a necessity. No less than 3,000 Europeans and Eurasians were treated in the dispensaries of the province during the year. The dispensaries at Akyab and Moulmein were largely resorted to by seamen. Structure of hospi- tals in Burmah. The present Akyab dispensary is a very old structure raised on piles about six feet from the ground, and is sadly in need of thorough repair. The Kyouk Phyoo dispensary is "raised about 3½ feet from the ground, and is constructed partly of burnt brick and lime and partly of wood. The walls are of bamboo matting, plastered, and the roof is thatched with dhunnee leaves:" such seems to be the general construction of the hospitals in Burmah. Finances. The balance remaining to the credit of the dispensaries at the end of the year 1872 was Rs. 31,653, and the income of the present year was Rs. 53,924, being less than that of the previous year by Rs. 85,976, a difference due to the expenditure having been increased in 1872 by the sum of Rs. 95,353 under the head "repairs of buildings" in the Rangoon statement. Of the above income Government contributed Rs. 25,475. Contributions &c., brought in Rs. 16,180, and the balance at the end of the year was Rs. 31,037. DISPENSARIES IN THE HYDERABAD ASSIGNED DISTRICTS. The office of Inspector-General of Dispensaries was held as heretofore by Dr. R. T. Abbott, who submitted the report. Number of institu- tions. One new dispensary was opened during the year, and there were altogether in the province 3 civil hospitals and 21 dispensaries. Patients treated.
