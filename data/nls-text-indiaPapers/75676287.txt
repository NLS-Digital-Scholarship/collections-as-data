CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, POONA: Poona, 30th July 1932. From E. S. FARBROTHER, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.3 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1931-32. I continued to hold charge of the post of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under report. I was on tour for 83 days and travelled 2,376 miles by road and 2,875 miles by rail. During my tours, I visited 14 districts and the City of Bombay, inspected 44 hospitals and dis- pensaries, examined building sites for 5 of these institutions and discussed matters relating to their maintenance with Presidents of the District Local Boards. I visited the. Chembur and Bombay branches of the Bombay Pinjrapole in connection with an outbreak of Surra in the former, and the cattle breeding farm at Bankapur and Alladkatti village in connection with the protection of cattle against Rinderpest by the Serum Simultaneous Method. I also visited Manjri dry stock farm in connection with an outbreak of Rinderpest and the Central Poultry Farm, Kirkee, in connection with fowl disease. I was unable to tour during the month of December owing to urgent duties at headquarters. As usual I served as President of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College and also conducted the supplementary examination in October. 2.Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy held the post of Deputy Superinten- dent and my Personal Assistant throughout the year. He was on tour for 18 days and travelled 219 miles by road and 2,136 miles by rail. He inspected three Veterinary dispensaries in Dharwar District and as usual, visited the Bombay Pinjrapole and its branches to advise the Trustees of that institution on the work of their Veterinary Department. He also visited the dry stock farm at Manjri and vaccinated the fowls at the Central Poultry Farm against fowl cholera. I4 Mr. P. Miranda retired from service from the 18th of June and Mr. J. P. Damri was appointed in his place. Mr. M. Mohey Deen returned from leave on 7th of August 1931 and continued to hold his appointment till the end of the year. Mr. K. B. Nair who had been to Edinburgh for the Post-Graduate course returned to India and resumed his duty in June 1931 and continued to perform it till the end of the year. Mr. A. H. Khan held his appointment throughout the year. 4.The Students.5 9. On account of the present financial stringency and with a view to minimise expenditure at the College, Government have ordered that the total number of scholarships at the college should be reduced from 20 to 15, five in each class6 17.The Laboratory.7 due to a reduction in the mortality from Rinderpest. On the other hand, the number of outbreaks of contagious diseases reported and attended exceeds that of the previous year by 738, this being due to an increase in the number of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease. Three thousand, two hundred and nineteen outbreaks were attend- ed, of which 3,169 were reported, against 2,481 attended in 1930-31. Outbreaks occurred in all districts in the Presidency and in the City of Bombay. Equine Contagious Diseases. 23.Glanders.8 27.Black Quarter.9 disease was subsequently re-introduced into the village and 134 inoculated animals became affected and 27 died. 33.Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.10 Veterinary Dispensaries. Table IV. 41.There were 105 Veterinary Hospitals and dispensaries working at the beginning of the year. As a measure of retrenchment, the District Local Board, Ahmednagar, closed the dispensary at Shrigonda in the month of August 1931. The District Local Board, Nasik, opened one dispensary at Vani in Dindori taluka, without the assistance of a Government grant, in March 1932 and there were therefore 105 dispensaries still working at the end of the year. As usual, in addition to the above, a dispensary was opened during the fair season in the Dangs. This dispensary is itinerating and the officer in charge was on tour for 158 days and visited 212 villages. In the course of his tours he attended 53 outbreaks of contagious disease and protected 502 animals by serum inoculation and 841 by vaccination. It was found necessary to send him back to the Dangs during the months of August and September 1931 to suppress outbreaks which were reported during that period. The number of in and out-patients treated in hospitals and dispensaries increased from 172,471 to 187,641 during the year under report and the number of cases supplied with medicine for treatment at home without attending the dispensaries from 43,317 to 53,118. The average daily attendance at hospitals and dispen- saries throughout the Presidency proper, excluding cases supplied with medicine for home treatment, was 21.24. The number of castrations performed at hospitals and dispen- saries was 25,309 an increase of 828 over the number performed in the preceding year. Four hundred and four cases were sent to infirmaries under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and 142 owners were convicted for offences under the Act. Two hundred and sixty-nine of these cases were admitted in Poona City Hospital and 53 in Ahmednagar Hospital. 42.Buildings.11 one on invalid pension and one resigned. It is proposed to keep two of these posts vacant for the present. At the end of the year there were therefore 120 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed in the Department. There were 5 Veterinary Inspectors employed at the beginning of the year. In February, however, two of these posts were abolished owing to re-organisation proposals which were to be introduced on 1st April 1932 with a view to economy. For the remainder of the year the work of these two officers was divided between the remaining three Inspectors. The Veterinary Inspectors travelled 10,670 miles by road and 12,940 miles by rail. In addition to their usual duty of inspecting the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries in their Divisions, they visited 156 villages for checking the work done there, by Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and attending outbreaks of disease. It was necessary to curtail their tours for four months. 45.The names of the following officers are brought to the particular notice of Government for good work. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy, who during the period I have held the post of Superintendent, has been of the very greatest assistance to me as my Personal Assistant. He relinquished this post at the end of the year to take over charge of the post of Deputy Director of Veterinary Services; Mr. P. V. Nagarsheth, late Veterinary Inspector, Ahmedabad Division, Mr. S. N. Phatak, late Veterinary Inspector, Surat Division and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons Y. V. Limaye, S. M. Adi and D. R. Marathe. The clerical staff have also worked well and I would mention the names of the Head Clerk Mr. C. T. Udas, the Accounts-clerk Mr. P. G. Phadke, and Messrs. H. N. Patange and R. B. Awar. V12 dispensary entirely at its own cost at the present time, is indicative of the popularity of the great majority of these institutions and the need for more of them. It is regrettable that the District Local Board, Ahmednagar, found it necessary to close one of these institutions, particularly an old established one. The thanks of the Department are due to those officers of the Revenue and other Departments who gave assistance to the staff in carrying out their duties. E. S. FARBROTHER, Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency.

Out of the six District Local Board Stallions at the beginning of the year, two were handed over to Zamin- dars as the District Local Boards, owing to financial stringency, were unable to maintain them. There were thus four stallions at the end of the year. One hundred and seventy-five mares were covered during the year as against 212 in the previous year. The aggregate cost of the maintenance of the stallions was Rs. 2,804 of which Government contributed Rs. 1,469. Financial. 9.

No. 5545 of 1933. Poona, dated 31st July 1933. From J. H. G. JERROM, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Officiating Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, Poona; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1932-33. During the year the designation of the Superintendent was changed to that of "Director of Veterinary Service", Bombay Presidency, the Bombay Veterinary College and the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department being placed under his general supervision. Mr. E. S. Farbrother, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, throughout the year under, report. He was on tour for 105 days and travelled 1,062 miles by road and 9,268 miles by rail. He visited 12 districts and the City of Bombay and inspected 29 Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, the Bombay Veterinary College and the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors, Northern Division and Southern Division. In the course of his tours he interviewed the Presidents of the District Local Boards at Ahmednagar and Sholapur in connection with the maintenance of dispensaries and the control of epizootic disease. He attended the cattle show at Pandharpur, and visited the cattle breeding farm at Betegaon and the Panjarapole at Panvel. He attended the meeting of the Bombay Provincial Agricultural Research Committee at Poona and both meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla and Delhi, also the meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. He acted on the Committee appointed by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research to consider the draft bill for the prevention and control of contagious diseases affecting animals and the model rules to be framed thereunder. He served as President of the Board of Examiners at the Annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College held in April 1932 and also conducted the supplementary examinations in the following October. 2. The designation of the Deputy Superintendent was changed to "Deputy Director of Veterinary Services" and this officer was placed in charge of Revenue Central Division with a separate office. Khan Saheb J. D. Buxy was in charge of the Central Division from the beginning of the year to 1st of November 1932 when he proceeded on leave on medical certificate and the charge of his office was held by the Director in addition to his own duties for one month when Mr. Y. N. Marathe, Personal Assistant to the Director, was appointed to act as Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Central Division, and he continued to act until the end of the year. Khan Saheb Buxy was on tour for 21 days and travelled 136 miles by road and 970 miles by rail. He visited 9 villages for epidemic duty and inspected the Veterinary Dispensaries at Pandharpur and Bk Q362 Ahmednagar. At Pandharpur he made preliminary arrangements for the Veterinary Section of the Agricultural and Cattle Show, and also arranged for Virus Vaccination experiments against Rinderpest by the Veterinary Investigation Officer. He visited the Government Poultry Farm at Kirkee, Government House Dairy, Manjri Farm and Yeravda Central Prison in connection with epizootic disease. He visited the Chembur branch of the Bombay Panjrapole and advised the Panjrapole authorities on Veterinary matters. Mr. Y. N. Marathe was on tour for 59 days and travelled 1,541 miles by road and 1,218 miles by rail. He inspected all Veterinary Dispensaries in the Central Division excepting those in the Satara District. He visited 27 villages for epidemic duty and checking the work of the Subordinate Veterinary Officers and also for the purpose of general propaganda. Before his appointment to the post as acting Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Mr. Marathe, as Veterinary Inspector, acted as Personal Assistant to the Director and was succeeded by Mr. V. N. Kulkarni, formerly Veterinary Inspector in charge of Southern Division. I3 6. Of the 26 new students admitted, 12 were Natives of the Bombay Presidency, 8 of Mysore, 1 of Punjab, 1 of Central India, 1 of Madras, 1 of Ceylon and 2 of H. E. H. the Nizam's Dominion. Of the new students, 5 had passed the First Year Arts examination and 21 the Matriculation or S. L. C. examinations. The new students classified according to caste were 17 Brahmins, 1 Jain, 3 other Hindus and 5 Muhammadans. 7. The results of the Annual and Supplementary examinations held during the year were as follows:4 12. Excursions of Students.5 Research work in connection with the transmission of Nasal Granuloma to healthy cattle was undertaken this year. Some of the experimental animals died of acute intestinal schistosemiasis, in others the infection has been kept in check by the intravenous injection of Antimony tartrate, but so far no nasal lesions have been apparent. The animals are still under observation. 17. Employment of Graduates.6 Surra.7 26. Black Quarter.8 31. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.9 Mr. R. N. Naik was on tour for 184 days, travelled 3,181 miles by rail, 950 miles by road and 300 miles by sea. He visited 29 towns and villages in six districts, the slaughter house at Bandra for collection of various species of Schistosomes, the Northcote Cattle Breeding Farm, Chharodi, for investigation of contagious abortion and Johne's disease; the Central Poultry Breeding Farm, Poona, in connection with fowl diseases prevalent there, and other places for subjecting cattle to rinderpest goat virus vaccination experiments and for investigation into other animal diseases. Mr. Naik has done excellent work and his services will be of the utmost value to the Department. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table IV. 40. At the beginning of the year, there were 105 Veterinary Hospitals and dispensaries and this number fluctuated between 95 to 101 during the year. Consequent upon the reduction in the amounts of Govern- ment grants-in-aid to Veterinary Dispensaries on account of retrenchment in the expenditure of the Department, the District Local Board, Poona, closed three of their five veterinary dispensaries at Khed, Talegaon-Dhamdhere, and Talegaon-Dabhade from 1st July 1932. These were subsequently re-opened on 1st December 1932 on the District Local Board being offered an additional grant. The District Local Board, Ahmednagar, for the same reason closed seven out of eight veterinary dispensaries in the District from 1st of August 1932 and none of them were re-opened during the year. By the closing of these dispensaries in Ahmednagar District, the District was deprived of valuable Veterinary aid in controlling contagious cattle disease which was very ripe during the year. A reserve staff of four Veterinary Assistant Surgeons had to be posted at suitable centres in this district, for epidemic duty. The District Local Board, Satara, decided to open three new Veterinary Dispensaries, viz. one each at Patan, Vita and Medha, without the assistance of Government grants-in-aid and these were actually opened towards the end of the year. Three Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were placed in charge of these dispensaries from the personnel made available by the closure of the Veterinary Dispensaries in the Ahmednagar District and at the end of the year there were therefore 101 Veterinary Dispensaries. In addition to the above, a Veterinary Dispensary was, as usual, opened during the fair season in the territory of Dangs. The dispensary was maintained as itinerating. The Veterinary Assis- tant Surgeon deputed to Dangs was on tour for 155 days and visited 227 villages. In the course of his tours, he attended 11 outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease and treated 279 animals. He also vaccinated 876 animals with Black Quarter Aggressin and treated 166 cases for non-contagious diseases. At headquarters, 19 cases were treated by him. In consequence of the closure of 7 out of 8 Veterinary Dispen- saries in the Ahmednagar District for a period of eight months, and Bk Q 3610 three Veterinary dispensaries in the Poona District for five months, the number of in and out-patients treated in the hospitals and dispensaries and castrations performed was reduced in comparison with the previous year's figures. The reduction is also due to the levying of fees for treatment by some Local Bodies during the year. Year. Number of in and out-patients treated.

Nine hundred and forty cases were sent to infirmaries under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals against 404 cases in the previous year. Three hundred and forty-two of these cases were admitted to Ahmedabad Veterinary Hospital, 290 in the Poona City Hospital and 78 in the Ahmednagar Hospital. 41. Buildings.11 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and attended three outbreaks of Rinderpest. He was also sent to organise and attend the Veterinary Section in the Agricultural and Cattle Show held at Pandharpur and the Cattle Show at Betegaon in the Thana District was also attended by him. The charge of the Southern Division was held by Mr. V. N. Kulkarni from 1st April 1932 to 8th December 1932 when he was transferred to Poona as Personal Assistant to the Director. Mr. J. G. Kulkarni acted as Veterinary Inspector of this Division from 7th December to the end of the year. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni toured for 124 days and travelled 3,539 miles by road and 2,124 miles by rail. He attended 24 outbreaks of Rinderpest and one of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and checked the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in 57 villages. Mr. J. G. Kulkarni during his acting period was on tour for 78 days and travelled 1,748 miles by road and 834 miles by rail. He attended 8 outbreaks of Rinderpest and visited 40 villages for checking the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons. All the twenty-eight Veterinary Dispensaries in this Division were twice inspected by these Inspectors during the year. 44. The staff of the Department both administrative and clerical, on the whole, worked satisfactorily during the year. 1 would bring to the notice of Government the following officers whose work is worthy of special mention:12 further progress. It is, however, gratifying to note that a scheme for investigation into animal diseases of this Presidency was launched during the year. This was rendered possible by the grant of a subsidy from the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and a Veterinary Investigation Officer was appointed for a period of five years. It is a matter of great significance that all the Local Bodies with the exception of Poona and Ahmednagar District Local Boards did their best to maintain all the Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries in their charge in spite of the Government grants-in-aid being reduced. The District Local Board, Satara, also opened three new Veterinary Dispensaries in the District without any assistance. This clearly goes to show that the people realise the necessity of these institutions. The thanks of the Department are due to those officers of the Revenue and other Departments who gave assistance to the staff in carrying out their duties. J. H. G.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT Office of the Commissioner in Sind, Government House, Karachi, 28th July 1933. Forwarded with compliments. Mortality statistics. 2. It is gratifying to note that the total mortality from conta- gious diseases as compared with that of the preceding year diminished from 29,347 to 12,480. The decrease is mainly due to the decline in the number of cases of and deaths from Rinderpest, the number of outbreaks of which disease among bovine cattle and other animals declined from 1,205 and 33 to 490 and 9 respectively. Castration. 3. The following statement shows the total number of animals castrated in each district :34 Dispensaries. 4. The number of dispensaries remained unchanged. The demand for an increase in the number of dispensaries is clear but cannot be met in view of the existing financial position of Government. Breeding operations. 5. The stallion " Bahadur " purchased by the District Local Board, Nawabshah, in 1921, which had been handed over by them in the preceding year to a zamindar on account of financial stringency, died of Surra on 22nd November 1932. The District Local Board have resolved not to buy another stallion in place of " Bahadur ". The stock got by the stallions of the District Local Board, Upper Sind Frontier, were prominent in the Horse and Poni Show held at Jacobabad and did well in the races. Fairs and Shows. 6. The number of exhibits in the Horse and Pony Show held at Jacobabad was less than in the previous Show. This was attributed to economic depression and to the fact that the Police have ceased to buy remounts. But as a whole the Show was more successful than was anticipated in view of the agricultural depression. The whole expense was borne by the District Local Board. Reporting of outbreaks. 7. The District Local Boards in Sind have issued instructions to their establishment to co-operate with the subordinate revenue establishment in report- ing outbreaks of contagious diseases as desired by Government in paragraph 12 of Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 6567/24, dated the 13th October 1932. It is hoped that this step together with that by which Seridars will be made responsible for reporting outbreaks, will lead to mitigate the long-standing complaint of the Veterinary Department about delay in reporting outbreaks. General remarks. 8. From the point of view of cattle health the year has been better than the preceding one. The Department continued to work smoothly and efficiently under the experienced guidance of Mr. Jerrom. R. E. GIBSON, Commissioner in Sind. To The Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bombay.

[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Annual Administration Reports of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, including the Bombay Veteri- nary College; the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department and the Civil Veterinary Department in Sind For the Year 1933-34 [PriceNo. 8292 OF 1934. Poona, dated 31st July 1934. From E. S. FARBROTHER, Esquire, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, Poona ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1933-34. I held charge of the post of Director from April 1st to April 27th, 1933, and from 14th November 1933 to 31st March 1934. During the period I was on leave, Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, officiated. I was on tour for 63 days, visited 5 districts and inspected 22 Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries and the office of the Veterinary Inspector, Central Range. I served as President of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College in April 1933. I also visited Bombay in connection with the meeting called by His Excellency the Governor to discuss the Manual of Village Improve- ment, the Provincial Agricultural Research Committee and the budget session of the Bombay Legislative Council. I attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research which was held in Delhi in February 1934. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom was on tour for 22 days and travelled 2,724 miles by rail and 465½ miles by road. During the course of his tours, he visited 4 districts and inspected 9 hospitals and dispensaries. At headquarters, he attended the meeting of Commissioners in connection with the revision of scales of pay of the Provincial Services, and the Provincial Agricultural Research Committee and was appointed an additional member of the Legislative Council for the discussion of the Bill for the Improvement of Live Stock. He also attended the Simla meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in August 1933. 2. Khan Sahib J. D. Buxy, Deputy Director, was on leave upto the date of his retirement in January 1934. Mr. Y. N. Marathe, Veterinary Inspector, officiated in the post during this period and on Khan Sahib Buxy's retirement, was confirmed. From the 1st April to 31st August 1933, the Deputy Director was in charge of the Central Revenue Division. Early in the year, however, proposals for the appointment of an additional Deputy Director, or, if financial conditions did not permit of such an appointment being made, for the existing officer to be relieved of his divisional charge so that he could be attached to the Director's establishment, were submitted to Government for sanction. Sanc- tion to the latter proposal was accorded in Government Resolution, Revenue Department, No. 8930/28, dated 25th July 1933, and from 1st September 1933, the Deputy Director took over his new office of Bk Q 39-1
2 Personal Assistant to the Director with touring duties. At the same time, Veterinary Inspector, Mr. V. N. Kulkarni, who had been carrying on the duties of Personal Assistant was appointed to an Inspector's range. This new arrangement has proved much more suitable. Mr. Marathe was on tour for 83 days and travelled 4,004 miles by rail and 1,258 miles by road and 34 miles by sea. He visited 10 districts, inspected 39 hospitals and dispensaries, attended the Agricultural shows held at Mulegaon in Sholapur district and at Saswad in Poona district. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni, while holding the appointment of Personal Assistant, attended two outbreaks of cattle disease. I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 3. Staff.3 7. The results of the Annual and Supplementary examinations held during the year were as follows :4 15. Clinical Instruction.5 Research work in connection with the transmission of Nasal Granuloma to healthy cattle was continued during the year but as no nasal lesions could be produced, the experiment was discontinued. 17. Employment of Graduates.6 Contagious diseases of Bovines. 22. Rinderpest.7 Contagious Diseases in other Animals. 28. Rabies.8 Other Diseases. Table III. 36. The members of the subordinate staff visited 5,553 villages during the year and treated 34,058 animals for contagious diseases and 8,150 for non- contagious diseases. Seven thousand, one hundred and ninety- seven animals were castrated in these villages. There was a considerable reduction in the number of cases treated for contagious diseases, due to foot and mouth disease not being so widespread as in the previous year. The number treated for non-contagious diseases and the number of castrations per- formed shows a slight increase, but much more could have been done in this direction had it been possible to permit the staff to tour more regularly. Investigation. 37. As usual, specimens were submitted to the Bombay Veterinary College Laboratory for diagnostic purposes. These numbered 420 and 277 post-mortem examinations were performed for investigation purposes. Thirty-eight post-mortem examinations were also conducted for medico-legal purposes. In twenty-three of these cases, viscera or visceral contents were forwarded to the Chemical Analyser to Government for Chemical examination and poison was detected in 7 cases. 38. Mr. R. N. Naik, the Investigation Officer, whose services have been made available by the assistance of a grant from the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, continued to do very valuable work. His report has been forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table IV. 39. At the end of the year 1932-33, there were 101 hospitals and dispensaries in the Presidency Proper. During the year, the District Local Board, Alimednagar, reopened four dispensaries on the receipt of a grant- in-aid from Government and the Kaira District Local Board opened a new dispensary at Matar in March 1934. No grant-in-aid is given to the latter institution, but the free services of a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon are loaned to the Board. There were therefore 106 hospitals and dispensaries at the close of the year. As a result of the suspension of grants-in-aid to the majority of the hospitals and dispensaries, fees for the treatment of animals has been introduced in four districts. In Kaira District, a small charge is made on first admission of a case only and this has not affected the attendance of patients to a very appreciable extent. In Poona, Dharwar and Kanara Districts, where a daily charge is made, the daily attendance has fallen very considerably and proposals have been submitted to the Boards to overcome this. An itinerating dispensary was opened in the Dangs as usual in April and May. The Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was on tour
9 for 49 days and visited 78 villages. He treated during this period 53 cases, supplied medicines to 15 cases and inoculated 25 animals in an outbreak of Rinderpest. The administrative control of this territory having been transferred to the Government of India in July 1933, at the request of the Agent to the Governor General, Western India States, the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon was again deputed to work there from 24th December to the end of the year. During this period, he was on tour for 74 days, visited 79 villages and attended 26 outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease and 20 of Rinderpest. He inoculated 253 animals with anti-rinderpest serum, vaccinated 208 animals against Black Quarter, and treated 451 cases for contagious and non-contagious diseases. The following table shows the number of cases treated in the dispensaries in the Presidency Proper during the year under report and the preceding year:10 The Veterinary Inspector, Mr. M. G. Kulkarni was on tour for 158 days. There are 36 hospitals and dispensaries in this range and he inspected 10 twice and 26 once. In the course of his tours, he visited 48 villages for checking the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, investigation of disease and propaganda purposes. The Central Range was created from 1st September 1933 and Mr. H. B. Shirsathe was appointed there with headquarters at Ahmednagar. He was on tour for 128 days, inspected all the dispensaries once and visited 32 other villages. He attended the Darbar held by His Excellency the Governor of Bombay and also cattle shows held at Saswad and Nasik. Mr. J. G. Kulkarni acted as Veterinary Inspector, Southern Division, from 1st April to 31st May and Mr. Shirsathe from 1st June to 1st September. On the creation of the Southern Range, Mr. Shirsathe was transferred to the Central Range and Mr. V. N. Kulkarni took over till the end of the year. Mr. J. G. Kulkarni was on tour for 45 days, Mr. Shirsathe for 22 days and Mr. V. N. Kulkarni for 123 days. All the dispensaries were inspected twice with the exception of three and 44 villages were visited for other purposes. IV. HORSE BREEDING OPERATIONS. 42. The District Local Board, Ahmednagar, has now only one stallion at stud. A covering fee of Rs. 5 is charged. The stallion covered 26 mares. Fees realised amounted to Rs. 130 and the cost of maintenance to Rs. 348-9-10. V. EXPENDITURE OF THE DEPARTMENT. 43. The expenditure of the Department amounted to Rs. 4,69,486-13-0 of which Rs. 3,46,959-3-2 was met from Provin- cial Revenues, Rs. 1,22,527-9-10 from the funds of District Local Boards and Municipalities and Rs. 9,121-8-0 from the grants made by the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. VI. GENERAL REMARKS. 44. Financial stringency prevented any further expansion of the staff and of the activities of the Department. The touring work of the subordinate staff has had to be curtailed very considerably during the past few years and this is reflected in the amount of work done in the villages. The orders of Government on the recommendations of the Re- organisation Committee so far as they refer to this Department, were received during the year. Government were unable to accept the recommendations regarding the formation of a Board of Rural Development, the closing of the Bombay Veterinary College, the discontinuance of grants-in-aid to Veterinary hospitals and dispen- saries and the levying of fees to increase the annual income of
11 these institutions and also that regarding the staff of the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department. The question of closing or removing a few Veterinary dispensaries is still under consideration. 45. In the retirement of Khan Sahib (now Khan Bahadur) Buxy, the Department has suffered a severe loss. He has rendered over 32 years of very faithful and zealous service to the Presidency, and I wish to place on record my appreciation of his work and of the very great assistance he has been to me during the 12 years I have held charge of the Department. The re-arrangements which took place during the year in the Department has resulted in additional work being thrown on the clerical establishment at the head office, work which all have shouldered cheerfully. The professional staff has worked well. The work of the following deserve special mention :13 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY CITY AND HARBOUR VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1933-34. The Report deals with the Equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work performed under the Live Stock Importation Act. 2. I held charge of the office of the Government Veterinary Officer and Mr. D. G. Haji, the officiating Deputy Superintendent, that of the Assistant Government Veterinary Officer, throughout the year under report. 3. During the year under report, 9 suspicious horses were seized under the Glanders and Farcy Act and taken to the Lazaretto. Of these, 7 were proved to be diseased within the meaning of the Act. Of these, 3 were cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis and 4 of Surra. The three cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis were destroyed. Of the 4 cases of Surra, 3 were successfully treated by Bayer 205 and were discharged and one was destroyed. All these horses belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire and by breed they were Arabs. 4. The following figures show the number of cases of the various diseases dealt with this year under the meaning of the Act, as compared with former years :14 7. The horses imported from Persian Gulf were for ordinary Bombay market. Besides 499 country bred horses were brought into Bombay from up-country by rail for the same purpose. The Australian imports were mainly to meet the requirements of the Military Departments. 8. The current repairs to the Lazaretto buildings were carried out as usual by the Public Works Department. V.

33 No. 2217/G-IV-3 of 1934-35. From M. MOHEY-DEEN, ESQUIRE, M.R.C.V.S., Acting Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana. To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. (Through the Commissioner in Sind, Karachi.) Karachi, 10th July 1934. Subject.35 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1933-34. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge of the office of Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, throughout the year with the exception from 21st April to 21st November 1933 when he acted as Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, and Mr. M. Mohey-Deen, M.R.C.V.S., acted as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana. Mr. Jerrom inspected all the dispensaries in Sind with the exception of Kandkot, Dadu and Naushahro and served as member of the Board of Examiners at Bombay Veterinary College. He was on tour in Sind for 68 days and Mr. M. Mohey- Deen inspected the Veterinary Dispensaries at Hyderabad, Dadu, Mehar, Nawabshah and Naushahro and was on tour for 22 days in Sind. In addition he remained 11 days on tour in Rajputana. Both the officers attended outbreaks of contagious diseases when possible. I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION 2. There were 3 scholars studying at the Bombay Veterinary College at the beginning of the year. Two passed out successfully and there was thus only one scholar studying at the end of the year. II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 3. Table I.36 8. Foot-and-Mouth disease.37 (v) Other Diseases. 20. Table III.38 Inspector was abolished with effect from 1st March 1934. There were thus 22 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and one Veterinary Inspector at the close of the year. Of the 22 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, 19 were in charge of dispensaries and 3 were on reserve duty. 26. The Veterinary Inspector, Upper Sind Circle, was on tour for 69 days and travelled 1,338 miles by rail and 179 miles by road. The Veterinary Inspector, Lower Sind Circle, was 93 days on tour and travelled 2,099 miles by rail and 633 miles by road. They attended outbreaks of contagious diseases and supervised the work of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons whenever possible. The touring of the Veterinary Inspectors was resumed in December 1933. Both the Veterinary Inspectors and Mr. K. M. Sullaiman, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Matli, did creditable work during the year. 27. The clerical staff as usual carried out their duties most satisfactorily. V. EXPENDITURE OF THE DEPARTMENT 28. The expenditure of the department was Rs. 1,05,481 as compared with Rs. 1,18,534 in the previous year. VI. General Remarks. 29. The reporting of contagious diseases still leaves great room for improvements. The monthly touring of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons was resumed for propaganda work and to find out if any contagious disease prevailed. During their tours they located several outbreaks which were successfully dealt with in time and negligence of defaulting Tapedars brought to the notice of the Collectors. 30. Propaganda work is very necessary and it is hoped that Government will be able to find funds to meet the extra expenses of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons' tourings. 31. Some leaflets on important contagious diseases were printed and distributed through several agencies. 32. Thirty-four horses and 23 sheep and goats were landed at the Port of Karachi. Of these 25 horses came from United Kingdom, 9 horses from Persian Gulf and 23 sheep and goats from Jeddah. 33. At the request of the Agricultural Adviser to the Govern- ment of India, the following programme of work for the next year is included in the annual report. The energies of the Department will be directed towards the investigation of certain diseases and application of modern methods of treatment both curative and prophylactic. M.

Reports. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] Annual Administration Reports of the Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, including the Bombay Veteri- nary College; the Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department and the Civil Veterinary Department in Sind For the Year 1934-35 [PriceNo. 7023 OF 1935. Poona, dated 23rd July 1935. From E. S. FARBROTHER, Esquire, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Presidency, Poona ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay. Subject.1 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESIDENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1934-35. I continued to hold charge of the Department throughout the year. I was on tour for 109 days and travelled 8,476 miles by rail, 2,696 miles by road and 22 miles by steamer. I visited 14 districts, and inspected 42 Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries, the Office of the Veterinary Investigation Officer and the Bombay Veterinary College. As usual, I presided over the annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College in April and conducted the supplementary examination held in October. I also attended, as a member, the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research held at Simla and Delhi in September 1934 and February 1935, respectively. I conducted a special tour in the Thana District in connection with the proposal to remove the Veterinary Dispensary now located in Vada to a more suitable centre and also visited the village uplift centre in Sholapur District and the Government Cattle Breeding Farm at Bankapur. 2. Mr. Y. N. Marathe held charge of the post of Deputy Director and Personal Assistant to the Director from 1st April to 3rd December, when he proceeded on 4 months' leave. From 26th December to the end of the year Mr. V. N. Kulkarni, Veterinary Inspector, Southern Range, was appointed to officiate in this post. Mr. Marathe was on tour for 47 days, travelled 2,103 miles by rail and 278 miles by road. He inspected 21 Veterinary dispensaries in 7 districts, attended the Agricultural Exhibition held at Barsi in Sholapur District and made enquiries into the cause of death among cattle in the village Vadup in Kolaba District. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni was on tour for 17 days, and inspected 8 Veterinary dispensaries in two districts. He travelled 1,089 miles by rail and 227 miles by road. I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION 3. Mr. V. R. Phadke, G.B.V.C., the Principal of the College, was on leave for four months from 24th November to 23rd March. During his absence Mr. M. Mohey Deen, Assistant Professor, officiated as Principal. Mr. M. Mohey Deen was deputed to Sind to officiate as Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana, during the absence on leave of Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom. During the period Mr. Mohey Deen was absent in Sind and officiating as Principal, Mr. K. R. S. Aiyar, Lecturer at the College, officiated as Assistant Professor and Mr. T. N. Kulkarni, a member of the Subordinate Veterinary Service, acted as Lecturer. RP Bk Q 132 4. The Students.3 The following table shows the number of specimens received and examined during the year :4 The average number of students living in the hostel was 64 against 40 last year. Mr. A. H. Khan, the Hostel Superintendent, continued to look after the students residing there. Excursions to local places of interest were made by the students as usual. Class B students visited the Cattle Breeding Farm at Betegaon and the dairy farm of the Infants and Public Milk Supply Company at Palghar in Thana District. II. DISEASES OF LIVE STOCK. Table I. 13. Reporting of Contagious Diseases.5 16. Foot and Mouth Disease.6 26. In 364 villages, 33,708 animals were inoculated with anti- hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum and in 30 villages, 2,560 were vaccinated against the same disease. In 1933-34, 21,348 animals were inoculated with anti-serum and 1,504 vaccinated. Although the increase can be mainly attributed to the greater prevalence of the disease in the year under report, it is, nevertheless, very satisfactory, particularly when one remembers that all were done on payment of fees. Sixty-one deaths were reported among protected stock. 27. In 96 outbreaks of Black-quarter 11,049 animals were protected by vaccination of which 17 died. The increase in the number of animals protected over that of last year, viz. 1,159 and the results obtained are again very satisfactory. 28. Only six animals were inoculated with anti-anthrax serum and all were reported to have passed successfully through the outbreaks. 29. Twenty-five fowls were vaccinated against Fowl Cholera of which five died. 30. A sum of Rs. 5,166-9-6 was recovered as fees for the protec- tion of stock by anti-serum inoculation or vaccination against all diseases except Rinderpest. Other Diseases. Table III. 31. The members of the staff visited 7,202 villages against 5,553 in the previous year. They treated 56,851 animals for contagious diseases and 10,973 for non-contagious diseases and castrated 10,770. It was possible to allow the subordinate staff to tour a little more freely during the year and this is reflected in the amount of work carried out in villages, other than that done in connection with the control of epidemics and the treatment of animals suffering from contagious diseases. Investigation. 32. Six hundred and forty specimens were sent to the Bombay Veterinary College for examination and 239 post-mortem examinations conducted for confirmation of diagnosis. Sixty-two post-mortem examinations were performed for medico-legal purposes and in 16 cases material was sent to the Chemical Analyser to Government for analysis and poison was detected in 11. 33. At the Bombay Veterinary College, an experiment was conducted to ascertain the viability of Rinderpest virus in the spleen tissue of infected goats after keeping it in the refrigerator for varying periods and then at room temperature, also for varying periods. It was found that the virus may remain viable up to 40 days when stored at 45°F. but when removed from the refrigerator after 29 days, viability was completely lost when kept for three days, at about 85° F.
7 34. The Veterinary Investigation Officer continued to do useful work. During the year he was on tour for 296 days, travelled 8,433 miles by road and 3,956 miles by rail. The following is a summary of his work during the year. 35. Rinderpest.8 that in addition to the known infected areas, viz. Dharwar and East Khandesh Districts, the condition also occurred in Bijapur, Belgaum, Kanara and Gujerat. 42. Other parasites of cattle studied included ticks, cutaneous filaria and Ornithodorus Savignyi. 43. Experimental curative and preventive treatment against Hæmonchus Contortus and Oestrus ovis infection is being carried out in a flock of sheep in Poona District and the results are being watched. 44. Heterakis Gallinæ has been found to be of common occurrence in fowls in all districts visited. Veterinary Dispensaries. Table IV. 45. No new hospitals or dispensaries having been opened during the year the number remained at 106 including the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Hospital at Nasik for which a grant- in-aid is given by Government. The following table shows the number of cases treated during the year at these institutions compared with 1933-34 :9 49. There were three Veterinary Inspectors' posts and they were held by the following officers :10 55. The staff, as a whole, worked well and I desire to record my appreciation of the assistance given by all members in carrying out the duties which the Department has had to perform. In particular I desire to bring the names of the following officers to the notice of Government:11 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY CITY AND HARBOUR VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1934-35. The Report deals with the Equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work performed under the Live-stock Importation Act. 2. During the year under report, I held charge of the office of the Government Veterinary Officer for 8 months. I was on leave for 4 months from 24th November 1934 to 23rd of March 1935 during which period Mr. M. Mohey Deen officiated for me. Mr. D. G. Haji held the appointment of the Deputy Superintendent and that of the Assistant Government Veterinary Officer through- out the year. 3. During the year, 7 horses were detected and removed to the Government Lazaretto, as suspicious cases, under the Glanders and Farcy Act. Of these, 2 were cases of Epizootic Lymphangitis and 5 of Surra. The 2 cases of the Epizootic Lymphangitis were destroyed. Of the 5 cases of Surra, 3 were successfully treated by Bayer 205 and were discharged as cured ; 1 case was destroyed and 1 died. Of these, 6 belonged to owners of carriages plying for hire and 1 to a private individual. By breed they were 1 English, 4 Arabs and 2 Country breds. 4. The following figures show the number of cases of the various diseases dealt with, this year under the meaning of the Act, as compared with former years :12 mallein under the Live-stock Importation Act and I having reacted to the test, was destroyed as non-clinical case of Glanders as against 3 last year and 3 in the preceding year. 7. Of the 612 horses imported from Persian Gulf, 609 were for the ordinary Bombay market and 3 were for private use. Besides 490 Country bred horses were brought into Bombay from up-country by rail for market purposes. The Australian Imports were mainly for the requirements of the Military Departments. V. R.

31 No. 1927/G-IV-3 of 1935-36. Karachi, 11th July 1935. From J. H. G. JERROM, Esquire, M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana ; To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Revenue Department, Bombay, (Through the Commissioner-in-Sind, Karachi.) Subject.33 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, SIND, FOR THE YEAR 1934-35. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. Mr. J. H. G. Jerrom, I.V.S., held charge throughout the year, except from 14th April to 14th November 1934 when he was on leave, and Mr. M. Mohey-Deen, M.R.C.V.S., acted as Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana. Mr. Jerrom was on tour for 86 days. He attended outbreaks of contagious disease whenever possible and inspected most of the Veterinary Dispensaries. He served as a Member of the Board of Examiners of the Bombay Veterinary College and acted as Judge at the Jacobabad Horse Show. Mr. Mohey-Deen was on tour in Sind for 25 days during which he inspected seven Veterinary Dispensaries. He attended some outbreaks of Rinderpest and supervised Goat Virus Inoculations. In addition, Mr. Mohey-Deen was on tour in Rajputana for 8 days. I. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. 2. The scholar who was studying at the Bombay Veterinary College failed in the final examination. Two scholars were sent during the year, of whom one discontinued his studies and the other was studying at the close of the year. (He has since failed and the scholarship was discontinued.) II. TREATMENT OF DISEASE. 3. Table I.34 8. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.35 (iv) Preventive Inoculation. 18. Table II.36 (vii) Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. 25. Table IV.37 GENERAL REMARKS. 32. There has been no improvement in reporting of outbreaks so far as Tapedars are concerned. The monthly tours of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons were continued, as far as funds and circum- stances allowed, and much good work was done, especially in bringing to light outbreaks of diseases which otherwise, would never have been reported. The work done is, however, necessarily very limited and if the services of the department are to be made available for all live stock owners, more dispensaries and a larger staff for touring and propaganda work will be necessary. 33. Thirty horses, one mule and 51 sheep and goats were landed from overseas at the port of Karachi during the year under report. In addition, 308 mules, one horse and five donkey stallions were imported by the Military Department. 34. Government have sanctioned the establishment of a Rinderpest Goat Virus Producing Station at Karachi and it is hoped to have this working by December 1935. This should enable the department to deal promptly with outbreaks of Rinderpest and considerably reduce the mortality from that disease. J. H. G. JERROM, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Sind and Rajputana. Karachi, 11th July 1935.

Subject.ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE CIVIL VETERINARY DEPARTMENT, BOMBAY PRESI- DENCY, FOR THE YEAR 1935-36. I continued to hold charge of the Department during the year under report. I was on tour for 108 days and travelled 6,730 miles by rail and 2,171 miles by road. I visited 8 districts and inspected 32 hospitals and dispensaries and the Bombay Veterinary College. As usual I acted as President of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the College and also conducted the supplementary examination. I attended the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Delhi and Simla and also the Animal Husbandry Research Workers Conference held at Delhi following the meeting of the Advisory Board. I visited the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute at Muktesar and also the serum institute at Izatnagar. 2. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni, Veterinary Inspector, Southern Range, officiated as Deputy Director on 1st and 2nd April 1935. On 3rd April, Mr. Y. N. Marathe resumed charge of this post on return from leave. Mr. Marathe was on tour for 36 days, travelled 2,803 miles by rail and 457 miles by road- During the course of his tours he visited 6 districts, inspected 10 hospitals and dispensaries and attended the cattle and dairy show held at Asoda in East Khandesh District. In addition he visited several villages in connection with the Village Uplift Movement and out-breaks of disease. I.2 Of the 40 new students admitted, 25 were natives of the Bombay Presidency, 7 of the Central Provinces, 2 from Central India, 1 of Madras, 1 of Mysore, 1 of Nizam State, 2 of Ceylon and 1 of Burma. Eight had passed the Inter Science Examination, 1 the Inter Arts, 7 First Year Arts, 1 Senior Cambridge, 1 Junior Cambridge and 22 the Matriculation or School Leaving Certificate Exami- nations. 6. The Annual examinations were held in April 1935. The results are shown below :3 9. The Laboratory.4 Spleen tissue kept in refrigerator for 9 and 14 days and at room temperature 77° to 82° F for 4 and 5 days reacted but on the 6th day failed to react. Also spleen emulsion stored at room temperature 90° to 92° F was tested and in two experiments up to 4 days gave uniform reactions but on the 5th, 6th and 8th day failed to react. The same when stored at room temperature 80° to 82° F and tested on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th day was found to be viable. 10. Employment of Graduates.5 II.6 18. Black Quarter.7 now been made general. A certain number of cattle were vaccinated in clean villages without any untoward results. Thirty-seven thousand, one hundred and sixty animals were inoculated with serum alone in 299 villages of which 48 died. 29. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia.8 INVESTIGATION. 36. Mr. Naik, the Veterinary Investigation Officer continued to do useful work during the year. A separate report on his work has been forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research from which body a grant for this work is received, and to Govern- ment, His investigations included work on Rinderpest, Tubercu- losis, Johne's Disease, Bovine Abortion, the Protozoan and Parasitic Diseases of cattle and diseases of poultry. Mr. Naik attended the Animal Husbandry Research Workers' Conference held in Delhi in February last and read a paper on " The Diagnosis of Bovine Tuberculosis in India with a brief note on the methods available for the disposal of infected animals ". Hospitals and Dispensaries. Table IV. 37. There were 106 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, including one maintained by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Nasik, to which a grant-in-aid is given by Government, on 1st April 1935. During the year, the District Local Board, Ahmednagar, reopened three more of the dispensaries which were closed owing to the necessity of retrenchment in 1932, the District Local Board, Sholapur, opened new dispensaries at Malsiras and Madha and the District Local Board, Bijapur, opened one more at Bagewadi. There were, therefore, 112 hospitals and dispensaries working at the end of the year. At these dispensaries, 2,52,793 animals were treated compared to 2,50,570 animals treated in 1934-35. Details of these cases are given in Table IV. The average daily attendance at all hospitals and dispensaries was 20.26. The daily attendance at Ahmedabad Hospital averaged 67.0, at Jalgaon 64.13, at Sholapur 60.68 and at Poona 52.4. 38. A reference was made in last year's report to the appoint- ment of two touring Veterinary Officers by the Village Uplift Committee, Ahmedabad. These two officers have continued to work during the year under report and have done useful work. One was transferred from Viramgaum Taluka to North Daskroi Taluka. This appears to be a direction in which other District Committees in whose areas the number of hospitals and dispensaries are few, could do useful work. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 39. Four hundred and seventeen cases were sent to infirmaries under the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Of these 81 were sent to the Veterinary Hospital, Ahmedabad and 181 to the Veterinary Dispensary at Dholka in the same district. In addition to the hospital maintained by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Nasik the Societies at Poona and Ahmedabad have each started a hospital at Poona and Ahmedabad respectively. There should be ample scope for all these institutions.
9 III.10 cheaper, but it ensures a much longer immunity which will carry the vaccinated animal safely through a prolonged outbreak. The necessity of charging fees for other preventive inoculations and vaccinations continues to hold up any great advance. 44. Since the impetus given to poultry breeding through the Village Uplift Movement, the diseases of poultry are claiming more of the attention of the Department. Leaflets on the more common of these diseases are in course of preparation. A further expansion of the staff of the Department is essential to meet require- ments. 45. The Bombay Veterinary College continues to be a popular institution judged by the number of applications for admission to it. It is essential that the curriculum be revised to bring it up to modern requirements in the teaching of veterinary science. 46. The names of the following officers are brought to the notice of Government for particularly good work :11 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY CITY AND HARBOUR VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1935-36. The Report deals with the Equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work performed under the Live Stock Importation Act. 2. The staff.12 6. Of the 443 horses imported from the Persian Gulf, 413 were for the ordinary Bombay market and 30 were for private owners. Besides these 286 country bred horses were brought into Bombay from the Punjab and the United Provinces by rail for market purposes. The Australian imports were mainly for the requirements of the Military Department. 7. A census of horses in the City of Bombay and Bandra was taken by this Department this year. The total number of horses used for hack victorias and by private owners including those brought for racing and market purposes was 6,425. Of these 2,584 were Arabs, 1,745 Walers and 2,096 country breds. 8. Certain additions and alterations were made to one of the godown in the Inspectors' office at the Lazaretto and an additional water storage tank was provided as the place was required to be utilised for the purpose of producing goat virus. This work was completed at a cost of Rs. 500 approximately. V. R. PHADKE, Principal, Bombay Veterinary College, and Government Veterinary Officer, Bombay City and Harbour.

Dispensaries. 4. The number of dispensaries during the year under report was the same as in the previous year. The number of in and out-patients, however, increased from 27,402 in the previous year to 28,127 in the year under report. In addition to this, medicines and advice were given in 3,698 cases which were not brought to the dispensaries for treatment, as against 3,349 in the previous year. This testifies to the fact that the Veterinary dispensaries are growing popular in Sind. 5. Another notable feature of the year was the establishment by Government of a Rinderpest Goat Virus Producing Station at Karachi. Work at the station was commenced in January 1936, with Mr. Haji as Officer in Charge of the Station. Horse Show. 6. The District Local Board, Upper Sind Frontier, successfully organized the Horse and Pony Show at Jacobabad during the year under report.

Of this amount Rs. 79,840 was met from the Provincial Revenues, the remainder being met from the Local Fund revenues.
49 General. 9. As usual the department has worked efficiently. The Revenue Commissioner views with satisfac- tion the testimony of the Director, Veterinary Services, Sind, regarding the good work done by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons, especially in bringing to light outbreaks of disease which otherwise might have escaped notice. In conclusion the Revenue Commissioner expresses his satisfac- tion at the growing popularity of the department which is largely due to the zeal and efficient supervision of Mr. Jerrom. (Signed) R.

This diluted blood virus is proposed to be issued in the districts for testing and if it gives good reactions, it would result in a great saving in that the output would be doubled. 10. Employment of Graduates.6 This is the last Annual Report of the College at the hands of Mr. V. R. Phadke, G.B.V.C., J.P., who is retiring very shortly and as such he wishes to place on record his appreciation of the co-operation which he received from the members of the College staff both instructional and clerical, during the tenure of his office. II.7 16. Foot and Mouth Disease.8 24. Other Diseases.9 and Mouth Disease. The increase in non-contagious cases is due to the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons visiting more villages in connection with village uplift movement. 33. The staff visited regularly selected villages, throughout the year, in connection with the village uplift movement. Propaganda for the improvement of conditions under which the stock are maintained in the villages, the castration of animals unsuited for breeding purposes and the protection of stock from contagious and parasitic diseases is being carried out. Investigations. 34. Mr. R. N. Naik, the Veterinary Investigation Officer, continued to do useful work during the year. A separate report on his work has been forwarded to Government and to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research from which body a grant for this work is received. His investigations included work on Rinderpest, Bovine Tuberculosis, Johne's Disease, Bovine Abortion, Mastities, Bovine Sterility, Parasitic Diseases of cattle and diseases of poultry. Mr. Naik attended the meetings of Veterinary Progress Reports Committee and the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Simla in July 1936; also attended the second meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture at Madras in December 1936 and submitted a note regarding the desirability of introducing suitable cattle dips on a wide scale in India for the eradication of ticks. Hospitals and Dispensaries. Table IV. 35. No new hospital or dispensary having been opened during the year the number remained at 112 including the one maintained by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Nasik, for which a grant-in-aid is given by Government. The following table shows the number of cases treated during the year at these institutions compared with the previous year:10 The average daily attendance at all dispensaries was 19.74. 36. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Poona, has taken a new move, the first of its kind in this Province in starting a travelling motor dispensary from 23rd April 1936 for the treatment of animals from interior rural areas to whom veterinary aid was not hitherto available unless with great difficulty and expense. This branch of service has been opened by the Society through the munificent donations of Mrs. Raven Scroft of California (U. S. A.) and consists of a van fully equipped with all the necessary instruments and medicines to give immediate relief to dumb animals. This dispensary is in charge of a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon from the Subordinate Veterinary Service of this department whose services have been spared by Government free of charge to the Society. Since April 23rd, 1936, to March 31st, 1937, the van has travelled a distance of 1,575 miles and 672 animals were treated by the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon of which 24 were equines, 582 bovines and 66 others and 44 castrations were performed. The treatment given was free. 37. The touring Veterinary Officers appointed by the Village Uplift Committee, Ahmedabad, who were doing useful work, got permanent appointments in Baroda State. The Committee, being unable to secure services of veterinary graduates, this work had to be held in abeyance and the rural area has been deprived of this valuable assistance for want of veterinary graduates. 38. Building.11 41. Of the cadre of 130 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons including the temporary one for goat virus producing station, there were 125 Veterinary Assistant Surgeons employed including the one transferred to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Nasik.

I was on leave from 24th April to 19th November 1937 and during that period Mr. (now Rao Bahadur) V. R. Phadke, Principal of the Bombay Veterinary College officiated as Director. During the period of the year that I was on duty, I was on tour for 58 days and travelled 2,087 miles by rail and 2,226 miles by road. During the course of my tours, I visited nine districts, inspected 30 hospitals and dispensaries and attended the District Agricultural Show at Sanand in Ahmedabad District and the Karnatak Agricultural Show at Belgaum and inspected the Bombay Veterinary College. As usual, I served as President of the Board of Examiners at the annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College held in April 1937. Mr. Phadke was on tour for 73 days and travelled 7,810 miles by rail and 944 miles by road. He attended the " Cattle Conference " held in Simla in May 1937 and also the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research in Delhi in November. He visited 7 districts of the Province and inspected 29 hospitals and dispensaries, inspected the office of the Deputy Superintendent, Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department, and attended meetings held by the Collectors of East Khandesh and Bijapur in connection with the Village Uplift Scheme. He conducted the supplementary examination at the Bombay Veterinary College in October at which 18 students were examined. 2. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni held the post of Deputy Director and Personal Assistant to the Director throughout the year. He was on tour for 63 days, travelled 5,326 miles by rail and 425 miles by road. In the course of his tours he visited 9 districts and inspected 16 Veterinary Dispensaries. He acted as Secretary of the Veterinary Section of the Karnatak Agricultural Show and arranged the Departmental exhibit at that Show and also at the Show held at Sanand. I.2 4. The Students.3 9.

The divisional demonstration vans were also attended by members of the staff and demonstrations and lectures given to rayats. Investigations. 43. Mr. R. N. Naik continued his investigations of the diseases of live-stock and a report on the work accomplished by him has been forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and to Government. His main work was in connection with rinderpest prophylaxis, tuberculosis, Johne's disease, bovine abortion, tick borne diseases and sheep, goat and poultry diseases. Mr. Naik attended the 25th (Jubilee) Session of the Indian Science Congress which was held at Calcutta in January 1938 and was deputed to the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukte- swar, for a fortnight to acquaint himself with recent researches being carried out there and to discuss disease problems under investigation in this Province. Hospitals and Dispensaries. Table IV. 44. Four new dispensaries were opened during the year, viz. one at Prantij in Ahmedabad District, one each at Niphad and Sinnar in Nasik District and one at Hirekerur in Dharwar District. This brings the total number of hospitals and dispensaries in the Province, including one maintained by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Nasik, to which an annual grant-in-aid is given by Government, to 116. The four new dispensaries were opened towards the end of the year so that not much progress was made by them during the period with which this report deals. The following table indicates the number of cases treated at these institutions during the year compared with the figure for 1936-37. The average daily attendance for all the hospitals and dispensaries was 24.03 against 19.74 during the previous year:9 The Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Poona and Ahmedabad continued to maintain their hospitals. The travel- ling motor dispensary maintained by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Poona, also continued to function and did useful work. This dispensary is in the charge of a Veterinary Assistant Surgeon loaned to the Society free of cost by Government. III.10 reported from practically all districts of the Province, only 388 outbreaks and 5,239 deaths were recorded compared with 1,334 outbreaks and 20,725 deaths in 1936-37. The number of animals protected against this disease was accordingly proportionately less. For the first time in the past 16 years, Rinderpest was confirmed in a flock of sheep and the outbreak was successfully controlled and eventually stamped out by the regular inoculation of all incontact sheep with anti-rinderpest serum. 51. The inclusion of the diseases of poultry among the notifiable diseases has resulted in a far larger number of outbreaks of such diseases being brought to notice. In view of the impetus that has recently been given to poultry breeding, this is of great importance as the Department can give considerable assistance to breeders in preventing loss from this cause. It is regrettable that so far no curative or preventive treatment has been found of value for Doyle's (Ranikhet) disease. That the effects of this disease can be mitigated by the application of strict hygienic measures was well demonstrated in an outbreak that occurred on the Central Poultry Farm, Kirkee, towards the end of the year. Greater attention has also been given by the reporting agencies to equine diseases. 52. It is also pleasing to be able to report the opening of more Veterinary dispensaries small though the number is. At the present rate of progress, however, it will take very many years to complete the programme of opening one institution in each taluka and petha of the Province. In view of the large animal population of the Province, the number is extremely inadequate and a speeding up of the programme is essential. 53. The gradual increase in the number of patients treated at hospitals and dispensaries and of the work in villages indicates the growing appreciation of modern methods of treatment and preven- tion of disease by live-stock owners. 54. Owing to the very large number of applicants for admission to the Bombay Veterinary College, an unusually large number of new students was admitted during the year. In view of the limited accommodation and facilities, it will however be necessary to limit this number in future years. 55. Proposals for the expansion of the superior staff of the Department, for the improvement of the course of studies at the Bombay Vetetinary College and for the abolition of fees for the protection of live-stock against endemic diseases were submited to Government and are now under consideration. 56. The whole of the professional and clerical staff worked well, often under difficult and trying conditions. The names of the following officers are brought to the notice of Government for particularly good work:11 57. In order to impress Government's determination to stop corruption, etc., among the various services, upon all members of the staff a copy of Circular Memorandum, No. 1581/34, dated 25th August 1937, Political and Reforms Department, was sent to each. The thanks of the Department are due to all those gentlemen, both officials and non-officials who have given assistance to the Department in carrying out its duties. Programme of work. 58. The investigations into the causation and the application of preventive and curative treatment of the diseases of livestock will be continued. E. S. FARBROTHER, Director of Veterinary Services, Province of Bombay.
13 ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY CITY AND HARBOUR VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1937-38. The Report deals with the Equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work performed under the Live Stock Importation Act. 2. The Staff.14 Live Stock Importation Act either at the Dealers' stables or at the Lazaretto. Of these, 389 were found to be free from disease. One horse reacted to the mallein test and as such was destroyed under the act. 6. Of the 375 Arab horses imported from various ports, 305 were for the ordinary Bombay market and 70 for private owners. The Australian imports were mainly for the requirements of the Military Department. Besides these, 480 Indian horses were brought into Bombay from Punjab and United Provinces, for sale. 7.

I. ADMINISTRATION. I continued to hold charge of the Department throughout the year. I was on tour for 105 days and travelled 8,709 miles by rail and 2,451 miles by road. I visited 12 districts during the course of my tours and inspected 45 hospitals and dispensaries. I also visited various institutions and farms such as the Cattle Camp at Bhutnal, near Bijapur, the Mission Industrial School at Piramen, Taluka Ankleshwar, the Public and Infants Milk Supply Dairy Farm at Palghar and the Cattle Breeding Farm of the Bombay Gowrakshak Mandali where I acted as judge at the Cattle Show held there to celebrate the Centenary of the Mandali. 2. As usual I presided over the annual examinations of the Bombay Veterinary College and also conducted the supplementary examinations assisted by the Principal. I attended the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Delhi held in November 1938 and served as a member of the Animal Diseases and Animal Nutrition Sub-Committees of that Body. As a member of the Provincial Fodder and Grazing Committee, I attended the two meetings of the Committee held during the year. 3. The Animal Husbandry Expert to the Government of India visited Poona in August 1938 and, together with the Live Stock Expert, we discussed animal husbandry questions relating to this Province. 4. During the month of March I held charge of the Office of the Deputy Director of Veterinary Services in addition to my own duties owing to the unavoidable absence of the Deputy Director due to ill-health. 5. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni held the post of Deputy Director and Personal Assistant to the Director from 1st April 1938 to 28th February 1939. He proceeded on leave from 1st March owing to a sudden attack of illness and no substitute was appointed until after the close of the year. 6. Mr. Kulkarni was on tour for 26 days and travelled 1,275 miles by rail and 196 by road. He inspected 8 Veterinary dispensaries in 5 districts and conducted Mallein tests on two horses at Thana. II.

Thus out of a total of 3,109 specimens received for examination, 488 were positive as against 2,528 and 618 respectively during the last year. 16.Employment of Graduates.5 18.The College Hostel and Gymkhana.6 Tick Control Scheme. 23. This Scheme received the approval of the Governing Body of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and funds were allotted towards the end of the year. Two spraying machines were ordered from England and were received in January 1939. One of these machines was erected in Kumbhari in Sholapur District and was brought into operation from 15th March 1939. The second machine will be erected in Kanara District. 24. A dipping tank previously constructed at Turkewadi in Belgaum District was taken over and dipping operations started from 28th January 1939. 25. A second tank was under construction at Benkatti near Bagalkot in Bijapur District and at the end of the year plans were under way for the construction of three more tanks. A grant of Rs. 5,000 towards the cost of this Scheme was received from the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, the spraying machines being purchased by the Government of Bombay. IV. DISEASES OF LIVE STOCK. Table I. 26. Four thousand and ninety-five outbreaks were reported to and attended by the Departmental Staff, an increase of 1,660 over the number reported and attended last year. The total mortality recorded from this cause was 21,973 compared to 18,413 in 1937-1938 and 34,542 in 1936-1937. Contagious Diseases of Equines. 27.Glanders.7 32.Foot and Mouth Disease.8 In Poona District, 359 sheep were reported to have died of rinderpest. Investigations into these outbreaks failed to confirm rinderpest as the cause. Canines. 43. Fifty-two deaths from rabies and 23 from other diseases were reported. Diseases of Fowls. 44.Doyle's (Ranikhet) Disease.9 51.Anthrax.10 Work in Villages. Table IV. 58. During the year, 12,942 villages were visited by the staff. In these villages, in addition to the vacci- nations and inoculations preformed, 46,366 animals were treated for contagious diseases, 33,033 for non- contagious diseases and 14,519 animals were castrated In the previous year, 10,560 villages were visited, 20,541 animals treated for contagious diseases, 27,262 for non-contagious diseases and 12,782 were castrated. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 59. Six hundred and sixty-one cases were sent to infirmaries by magistrates for treatment, mostly at Dholka in Ahmedabad District, Sholapur, Ahmednagar and Nasik. These figures only refer to cases sent to State-aided hospitals and dispensaries that have been declared infirmaries under section 6 (2) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Convictions were obtained in 404 cases. 60. The Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Ahmedabad and Poona, continued to maintain hospitals in those towns and the touring (Motor) dispensary maintained by the latter Society continued doing very useful work in certain areas of Poona District. VI. SUBORDINATE STAFF. 61.Inspectors.11 Mr. G. V. Dadhe, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Belgaum, took over charge of the office of Veterinary Inspector, Southern Range from Mr. G. G. Chebbi, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon, Dharwar, on 12th April and continued to hold the charge until the end of the year. Mr. Dadhe was on tour for 252 days and during the course of his tours visited 228 villages in connection with his inspection of Veterinary dispensaries and other duties. 62. Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.12 65. In villages also the number of cases treated has increased considerably. This is largely due to the wide-spread outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease but beside this an increase in the number of cases treated for non-contagious diseases and castrations is recorded. 66. Under contagious diseases, a further reduction in the number of outbreaks of rinderpest and of the mortality from this disease from 4,545 in 1937-38 to 1,881 in the year under report is recorded. There was, consequently a reduction in the number of animals protected. 67. Foot and Mouth disease was wide-spread, the number of outbreaks reported and attended being considerably more than double that of the previous year. The disease was reported throughout the year but the greatest number of outbreaks occurred during the second half of the year. 68. An increase in the number of outbreaks of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia reported and attended is recorded and also in the number of stock protected against that disease. There was a phenomenal increase in the number of outbreaks of Black Quarter attended, Ahmednagar district alone recording more outbreaks than were recorded for the whole Province during the previous year. Seasonal conditions were particularly favourable for these diseases but a number of outbreaks, particularly of Black Quarter were reported during the latter months of the year when there are normally only a few sporadic outbreaks. Taken as a whole, the year was a bad one for live-stock. 69. The Bombay Veterinary College continued to have a full complement of students. It is hoped that an improved course of training will be introduced in the near future. 70. Several new tables have been appended to this report on the suggestion of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and others modified to meet statistical requirements. Information concerning Tables VI-A and VI-B, relating to the number of approved bulls at stud in the Province has been obtained from the Department of Agriculture (Live Stock Section). Table VI-C is blank as there are now no approved stallions at stud in this Province. Table VII gives information regarding the cattle fairs and shows held in Bombay Province during the year and this information has been collected departmentally. Table VIII13 71. The whole of the Departmental Staff, both professional and clerical, worked well and I offer my thanks to them all for the readiness with which they have carried out their duties. Much of the outside work of the District Staff has to be undertaken during the monsoon season when communications are bad and the weather anything but ideal for touring but they have faced their difficulties cheerfully and without complaint. The clerical staft also deserves praise for the manner in which they have worked at high pressure for some time past. 72. My thanks are also due to those official and non-official gentlemen who assisted the Department in carrying out its duties. PROGRAMME OF WORK. 73. The energies of the Department will be directed towards investigation into the causation and the application of preventive and curative treatment of the diseases of livestock and the training of men desirous of taking to the Veterinary profession as a livelihood. E. S. FARBROTHER, Director of Veterinary Services, Province of Bombay, Poona.
ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BOMBAY CITY AND HARBOUR VETERINARY DEPARTMENT FOR THE YEAR 1938-39. The Report deals with the Equine diseases scheduled under the Glanders and Farcy Act within the Town and Island of Bombay, Bandra Municipality and Bombay Harbour and with the work connected with the Live Stock Importation Act. 2. The Staff.16 5. Of these, 1,079 were accompanied with valid certificates to the effect that they were free from symptoms of any disease. Three hundred and seventeen were tested with mallein under the Live Stock Importation Act either at the Dealers' stables or at the Lazaretto. Of these, 316 were found to be free from disease. One horse reacted to the mallein test and as such was destroyed under the Act. 6. Of the 326 Arab horses imported from various ports, 262 were for the ordinary Bombay market and 64 for private owners. The Australian imports were mainly for the requirements of the Military Department. Besides these 506 Indian horses were brought into Bombay from Punjab and United Provinces, for sale. 7.The Buildings.TABLE I AP Bk Qb 318 TABLE Statistics of Mortality from Contagious diseases and other causes Name of District Equines Glanders Surra.

I. ADMINISTRATION. I continued to hold charge of the Department throughout the year and was on tour for 128 days. During the course of my tours I visited all districts with the exception of East Khandesh and inspected 51 Veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. I also inspected a site for the construction of buildings for the Veterinary dispen- sary, Anklesvar, and in connection with the Tick Control Scheme, visited Kumbhari, Benkatti, Devgiri and Hosakuli, where dipping tanks and spraying machines were in operation, and Tandulwadi to consider alternative sites for the dipping tank to be constructed there. 2. As usual I officiated as President of the Board of Examiners appointed to conduct the annual examinations at the Bombay Veterinary College and also conducted the supplementary examina- tions held in October. Among other duties performed by me were the following:2 until 29th February 1940, when he again proceeded on leave preparatory to retirement. From 1st to 11th April, I carried out his duties in addition to my own and Mr. C. N. Desai, Veterinary Inspector, Northern Range, was appointed to officiate from 12th April to 30th June and again from 1st March to the end of the year. 5. Mr. V. N. Kulkarni was on tour for 18 days and travelled 2,024 miles by rail and 286 by road. He inspected five dispensaries and the building selected for a dispensary to be opened at Saswad in Poona District. 6. He also attended a Co-ordination meeting at Karwar and conducted a series of lectures to the training class for Subordinate Rural Development Officers. 7. Mr. C. N. Desai was on tour for 21 days, travelled 2,015 miles by rail and 187 by road. He visited four districts and inspected 9 dispensaries. II. VETERINARY INSTRUCTION. (By the Principal.) 8.The Staff.3 11.

Full details of the working of this scheme has been submitted to Government and the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research. The expenditure during the year amounted to Rs. 4,382-14-3. IV. DISEASES OF LIVE STOCK. 28. There was some reduction in the number of out-breaks Table I. reported and attended this year, the numbers being 3,265 reported and 3,262 attended compared with 4,095 attended in 1938-39. With the exception of rinderpest and anthrax there were fewer outbreaks of the more important diseases though the greatest reduction is registered under Foot and Mouth disease. In all, 63,975 head of stock were attacked and 20,420 died. Contagious Diseases of Equines. 29.Glanders.8 35. Black Quarter.9 Felines. 46. An extensive outbreak of disease occurred among cats in the Southern Division. It is a popular belief that such outbreaks proceed epidemics of human plague but investigation definitely showed that there was no similarity between the organism isolated from cats affected by this disease and the plague bacillus. Diseases of Fowls. 47. Doyle's (Ranikhet) Disease.10 the unprotected animals 189 are reported to have died during the course of the outbreaks. In 2 clean villages, 134 bovines were protected with spore vaccine. 55. Fowl Cholera.11 Work in Villages. Table IV. 61. During the year 13,561 villages were visited by the staff In addition to the inoculations and vacci- nations performed by them in these villages, they treated 27,563 animals for contagious diseases, 41,739 for non-contagious diseases and castrated 19,883. During the previous year, 12,942 villages were visited 46,366 animals treated for contagious diseases, 33,033 for non-contagious diseases and 14,519 animals were castrated. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 62. Four hundred fifty-nine cases were sent to infirmaries by magistrates for treatment, mostly at Sholapur and Ahmednagar and Dholka in Ahmedabad District. Three hundred and sixty- six owners were convicted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 63. The hospitals maintained by the Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Ahmedabad and Poona continued to do good work. Unfortunately, as a result of Government with- drawing the services of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeon lent to the Poona Society for duty with the travelling dispensary from 5th May 1939, this useful institution had to remain more or less idle for the greater part of the year. VI. SUBORDINATE STAFF. 64. Inspectors.12 Dispensaries in the Range twice excepting those in the Nasik and Sholapur districts which were inspected once only. He also visited 34 villages for cheking the work of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and paid visits to 3 Panjrapoles and 4 cattle markets. Southern Range.13 Rinderpest has been showing a gradual decline in recent years but this year there has been a small increase in the number of outbreaks reported and attended and consequent increased mortality. The whole of the Province has suffered to some extent with the exception of Sholapur District. We can expect a gradual increase in the incidence of this disease in future years. Foot and Mouth disease was not so prevalent as in the previous year though it showed a tendency to spread more widely towards the end of the year. The increase in the number of animals protected is mainly under Black Quarter though under Rinderpest an increase of a little over 1,000 protected is recorded. The District Local Board, Ahmednagar resolved to pay fees for the protection of stock owned by ryots in that district and a considerable increase in the number of animals treated with Black Quarter Vaccine resulted. The fees from all sources showed the phenomenal increase of nearly Rs. 6,000. With the close of the year, the old curriculum of the Bombay Veterinary College has been abandoned and a new curriculum will be introduced during the current year. This has necessitated a change in the standard of admission and instead of Matriculates only holders of the Inter-Science (B. group) certificate will be admitted to the College. The new curriculum introduces a great advance in Veterinary education in this Province. The work of the Department continues to expand and great difficulty is experienced in meeting demands made on us from time to time. There is, in particular, a lack of supervising staff and it is essential that this be made good if progress is to be made. Proposals in this direction have received the administrative approval of Government but for financial reasons, it was not possible to make any further appointments. All members of the staff have worked well. Sanction was accorded during the year to the appointment of one clerk and an additional peon in each of the offices of the Veterinary Inspectors and also of an additional clerk in the head office. The clerical staff has also worked well and unselfishly. My thanks are due to all those, officials and non-officials, who have assisted the Department in carrying out its duties, particularly to officers of the Revenue Department who have always shown their willingness to assist. PROGRAMME OF WORK. 68. The energies of the Department will be directed towards investigation into the causation and application of preventive and curative treatment of the diseases of livestock and the training of men desirous of taking to the Veterinary Profession as a livelihood. E. S. FARBROTHER, Director of Veterinary Services, Bombay Province.

I also inspected and selected sites and buildings for 7 dispensaries, visited the Northcote Cattle Breeding Farm, the dairy of the Rawalgaon Sugar Factory near Malegaon, District Nasik, the Nandurbar Pinjrapole and the Yeravda Stud Farm. I inspected cattle dipping and spraying operations at Turkewadi, Benkatti, Devgiri, Kumbhari and Halkar. I opened one more dipping tank at Tandulwadi in Walva Taluka of Satara district and also a veterinary dispensary started by Nandgaon Municipality. I held meetings of Veterinary Inspectors and Veterinary Assistant Surgeons at which rural development problems were discussed and attended the meeting of the Rural Development Board at Ahmedabad. I presided over the Board of Examiners appointed to conduct the annual examinations at the Bombay Veterinary College and conducted the supplementary examinations held in June and October and attended the meetings of the Advisory Board of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research at Simla and Delhi and also the meeting of the Animal Husbandry Wing of the Board of Agriculture in India held at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar in November. At headquarters I attended the meetings of the Provincial Agricultural Research Committee, the Provincial Fodder and Grazing Committee and the co-ordination meetings, held biennially, of the Heads of the Agricultural and Veterinary Departments and in Bombay was invited to attend a meeting of the Bombay- Sind Public Services Commission for the selection of a candidate for the post of Deputy Superintendent, Bombay City and Harbour Veterinary Department. 2. Mr. C. N. Desai held the post of Deputy Director and Personal Assistant to the Director, with the exception of a period of 18 days from 15th May during which he was on leave, throughout the year. During his absence on leave, I carried out his duties in addition to my own. RP Bk Qa 32 Mr. Desai was on tour for 38 days, travelled 2,906 miles by rail and 511 miles by road.

As the post was more or less vacant during the greater part of the year the approved programme could not be followed to any great extent. Some work was done on contagious bovine abortion and in connection with investigations into the incidence of this disease, we were glad of the visit of the Research Officer on Contagious Abortion at the Imperial Veterinary Research Institute. Work in connection with the control of Nasalgranuloma carried out in the previous year in a village in Dharwar District was checked up. It was found that although the disease had not been eradicated considerable improvement had been effected. This work is continuing. An experiment was conducted, in consultation with the Director, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, Mukteshwar, on the preparation of a Foot and Mouth disease vaccine. A full report of the activities of this Officer has been forwarded to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research and to Government. (b) Tick Control Scheme.8 Surra .9 35. Sheep Pox.10 In 272 clean villages, 28,733 animals were treated with goat adopted virus and of these 8 are reported to have died subsequently from the reaction. In addition to this, 366 animals were treated with virus and serum in 11 villages without mortality. 47. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.11 Work in villages. Table IV. 54. Sixteen thousand and forty-six villages were visited by the subordinate staff. It was possible to extend the tours of the Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the last quarter of the year as additional funds were allotted for the purpose. In addition to their disease control operations, the members of the staff treated 51,650 animals for contagious diseases and 52,780 for non-contagious diseases and castrated 24,499 animals during the course of their visits to villages. The corresponding figures for the previous year were, 13,561 villages visited, 27,563 animals treated for contagious diseases, 41,739 animals treated for non-contagious diseases and 19,883 castrated. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 55. Five hundred and fifty-three cases were sent to Veterinary infirmaries by Magistrates, mostly at Sholapur and Dholka. Four hundred and forty-three owners were convicted for offences under the Act. 56. The Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Ahmedabad and Poona continued to maintain their dispensaries for the treatment of Animals. The travelling motor dispensary main- tained by the latter Society was not able to do its usual amount of touring as no officer was available to accompany it. Four hundred and two cases were treated.

At the Bombay Veterinary College, a new curriculum has been introduced and the standard of admission raised. As anticipated this affected the number of candidates seeking admission but it is hoped that this will be a temporary set back only. 64. All members of the staff, professional and ministerial, worked well- and have readily co-operated in furthering the activi- ties of the Department. My thanks are due to all those gentlemen, both official and non-official who have so willingly assisted us in our work. PROGRAMME OF WORK. 65. The energies of the Department will be directed towards the investigation of the causes and the application of preventive and curative treatment of the diseases of livestock and the training of those desirous of taking to the veterinary profession as a means of livlihood.
