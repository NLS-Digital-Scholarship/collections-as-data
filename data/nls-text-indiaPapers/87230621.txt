ForTriennial Report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1911-12, 1912-13 and 1913-14. Period covered by the report. This report deals with vaccination in the triennium 1911-12 to 1913-14 but more especially with the work of the last year. Brief notes have already been submitted on the work of the preceding two years. Officers in charge of the depart- ment. 2. The charge of the office of Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent General of Vaccination, United Provinces, was held by Major J. C. Robertson, I.M.S., from the 1st of April 1911 to the 14th of May 1912 and by me from the 15th of May 1912 to the end of the triennium under report. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) 3. On the 1st of April 1911 the Family Domains of His Highness the Maharaja of Benares were formed into &quot; the State of Benares &quot; and the control of vaccination in that State was taken over, with the approval of the Government, by his Highness the Maharaja. The vaccination staff and statistics of the State have therefore been excluded from the returns of this department since that date. Two additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners were appointed in these Provinces( 2 ) were 49 assistant superintendents of vaccination in the province. The number of vaccinators employed in 1913-14 was 921 as against 922 in 1912-13 and 927 in 1911-12, the average number for the triennial period under review being 923 as compared with 921 in the preceding triennium. The decrease in their numbers is chiefly due, as explained above and in the previous reports, to the exclusion of the staff employed in the Benares and Tehri States from the provincial returns and cadre. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 4. Including the charges on account of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices the total amount of expenditure on vaccination in 1913-14 was Rs. 2,53,619 against Rs. 2,24,057 in 1912-13 and Rs. 1,81,792 in 1911-12. the average annual expenditure during the triennial period under review being Rs. 2,19,823 as against Rs. 1,71,444 in the preceding triennium. Excluding these charges, the expenditure in 1913-14 amounted to Rs. 2,01,559 as compared with Rs. 1,80,512 in 1912-13 and Rs. 1,53,200 in 1911-12, the average annual expenditure during the period under report being Rs. 1,78,424 as compared with Rs. 1,42,129 in the previous corresponding period. Taking the total expenditure under different heads separately it is found that in 1913-14 a sum of Rs. 1,97,805 was spent on establishment (including Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices), Rs. 47,590 on contingencies and Rs. 8,224 on travelling allowance as compared with Rs. 1,74,548, Rs. 41,555 and Rs. 7,954 respectively in 1912-13 and Rs. 1,40,594, Rs. 35,094 and Rs. 6,104 respectively in 1911-12. Out of the total expenditure of Rs. 2,53,619 in 1913-14, Rs. 1,65,167 was paid from the provincial funds, Rs. 52,758 from the local funds, Rs. 29,989 by municipalities and Rs. 5,705 by native states (including court of wards and private persons) against Rs. 1,46,345, Rs. 43,663, Rs. 28,668 and Rs. 5,381 respectively in 1912-13 and Rs. 1,14,957, Rs. 32,533, Rs. 29,016 and Rs. 5,286 respectively in 1911-12. The increase in expenditure is chiefly due to (1) the increase in the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, (2) the improvement in the pay of the vaccination staff and (3) the increased expenditure on the bovine lymph dépôt as explained in paragraph 18. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 5. During 1913-14 the average cost of each successful case of vaccination was one anna and eleven pies as compared with one anna and nine pies in 1912-13 and one anna and seven pies in 1912, the average cost during the triennial period under report being one anna and nine pies against one anna and seven pies in the preceding triennial period. The increase under this head is accounted for by the improvement in the pay of the vaccination staff and by larger purchases of calf lymph due to the replacement in many districts of arm-to-arm vaccination by calf lymph vaccination. In the above averages the cost of the bovine lymph depôt and the pay &c. of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their offices have not been taken into account for reasons explained in the notes on vaccination for 1911-12. The average cost of a successful case of vaccination in these provinces during the triennium under report is compared in the table below with that in other- provinces. It will be seen that in 1913-14 the cost was lowest in Bihar and Orissa and that the United Provinces stand fourth on the list. As compared with the preceding two years the cost of vaccination increased in all provinces except the North-West Frontier Province, Assam and Bombay in which there was a slight decrease.

( 3 ) General operations. (Statement I.) 6. The total number of persons vaccinated in 1913-14 was 1,640,005 as compared with 1,679,432 in 1912-13 and 1,484,653 in 1911-12( 4 ) prevalence of plague and in Muzaffarnagar, illness of a vaccinator for six weeks, dismissal of a vaccinator for fictitious work and prevalence of plague and relapsing fever were the chief factors. In Unao the decrease is said to be due to the fact that the lymph received during the first two weeks of October proved inert. This was largely due to the heat experienced by the lymph in transit but to a certain extent to the heat at the lymph dépôt in September during the inoculation period of the calves and the time during which glycerinated lymph is kept before issue. In future with the installation of a cold storage plant at the dépôt and the use of chloroformed lymph to kill adventitious bacteria the lymph issued early in the season will be of better quality. Successful vaccination and degree of protection afforded. (Statement I.) 3. In 37 districts out of 48, the number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population in 1913-14 was in excess of that of the preceding year. Of the best protected districts Garhwal as usual stands first with 79.08 against 68'31 in 1912-13 and 57.81 in the preceding year, the average annua number of persons successfully vaccinated, and the average annual death-ratl from small-pox, per 1,000 of population during the previous five years being 80.30 and .01 respectively. Naini Tal comes next with 61.96, 61.49 and 56.13 followed by Almora with 58.92, 51.98 and 50.52, Jhansi with 49.97, 50.23 and 47.74 and Hamirpur with 46.23, 45.92 and 45.77 persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population in 1913-14, 1912-13 and 1911-12 respectively. The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated, and the average annual death-rate from small-pox, per 1,000 of population during the previous five years, in these districts were 57.89, 54.54, 47.56 and 44.05 and .14, .20, .04 and .03 respectively. Amongst the worst protected districts, i.e. showing a low number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population, the most conspicuous are Farrukhabad with 22.00, 21.72 and 21.01, Bara Banki with 22.78,22.68 and 21.73, Sultanpur with 24.25, 24.00 and 23.91 and Azamgarh with 25 60, 25.58 and 22.24 respectively in 1913-14, 1912-13 and 1911-12. The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated and the average annual death-rate from small-pox per 1,000 of population during the previous five years were in Farrukhabad 18.85 and .12, in Bara Banki 19.51 and .30, in Sultanpur 23.56 and 1.11 and in Azamgarh 22.87 and .59. Of these districts Farrukhabad, Bara Banki and Azamgarh were noted in the previous triennial report as amongst the districts showing the lowest number of protected persons per mille of population. Though all these districts show an improvement over the preceding two years and over the normal, special endeavours should be made to raise them from the unenviable position they have retained during the last six years. Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 9. The number of successful primary vaccinations in proportion to births in 1913-14 was 45.37 per cent. for children under one year of age, 17.66 per cent. for children between the ages of one and under six years and 64.99 per cent. for all age periods as compared with 46.47, 17.72 and 66.25 respectively in 1912-13 and 45.87, 17.42 and 65.42 in 1911-12. The number of successful operations on children under one year of age in proportion to births for the years 1913-14, 1912-13 and 1911-12, was in the first range 56.77 per cent., 57.22 per cent. and 57.07 per cent. respectively. In the second range it was 36.75 per cent., 39.68 per cent. and 38.99 per cent., in the third range, 47.99 per cent., 47.99 per cent. and 48.57 per cent., and in the fourth range, 37.81 per cent., 37.99 per cent. and 37.36 per cent. respectively. From this it will be noted that the percentage of operations to births was highest in the first range. Although the percentages during the last year were lower owing to high birth-rates, the number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age was higher than in the preceding two years. As explained above,there were only two circles in 1911-12 but for the purposes of comparison statistics have been prepared for the four ranges. Mortality from small-pox. 10. In 1913 the death-rate from small-pox was .17 per mille of population against .07 in 1912 and .03 in 1911 and .30 the quinquennial average. Diagram. 11. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district is attached.
( 5 ) Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 12. The number of vaccinations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries in 1913-14 was 629 (375 primary and 254 revaccination) as compared with 933 in 1912-13 and 384 in 1911-12, the average for the three years being 649 against 432 for the preceding triennium. The number of vaccinations performed at dispensaries is small and is largely due to the establishment in the larger towns of vaccination stations and to the fact that in urban and rural areas the vaccinators make house to house visitations. Vaccination in municipalities. 13. Owing to the conversion of Nanpara municipality into a notified area on 1st April 1913, the number of municipalities in these provinces was reduced from 87 to 86 and that of notified areas increased from 45 to 46. For the purposes of comparison the statistics of Nanpara for the preceding two years have therefore been excluded from those for the municipal areas and included in those for the notified areas. The total number of (a) persons vaccinated in the municipalities of these provinces in 1913-14 was 123,391, (b) vaccinations performed 125,881, of which 2,490 were secondary vaccinations, (c) successful primary operations 101,016, (d) successful revaccinations 8,132, (e) persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population 37.01, against (a) 122,218, (b) 124,343, of which 2,125 were secondary vaccinations, (c) 101,116, (d) 6,867 and (e) 36.62 respectively in 1912-13 and (a) 115,281, (b) 117,397, of which 2,116 were secondary vaccinations, (c) 97,845, (d) 7,142 and (e) 35.61 respectively in 1911-12. There was thus an increase in the municipal vaccination work in 1913-14 compared with the preceding two years under all heads except successful primary operations, which compared with 1912-13 show a very slight decrease of 100 cases. In the list of municipalities showing the best protection, Jaunpur stands first with 84.91 against 80.87 in 1912-13 and 73.96 in 1911-12. Lakhimpur (Kheri) comes next with 67.45, 53.80 and 40.85. Then in order come Kalpi (Jalaun) with 64.44, 70.97 and 62.45, Unao with 64.10, 52.50 and 48.01, Naini Tal with 63.41, 51.05 and 52.79 and Mau (Jhansi) with 61.73, 66.68 and 94.92 respectively. Of the municipalties showing the least protection the most conspicuous are Rae Bareli with 14.95 in 1913-14, 35.26 in 1912-13 and 40.91 in 1911-12, Farrukhabad-Fatehgarh with 1920, 23.00 and 22.43, Nawabganj (Bara Banki) with 19.39, 16.85 and 10.26, Brindaban (Muttra) with 21.58, 20.44 and 30.25 and Roorkee with 25.20, 23.75 and 23.54 respectively. All the above municipalties except Kalpi, Mau, Rae Bareli and Farrukhabad- Fatehgarh show an improvement over the preceding year. In Kalpi and Mau the decrease is attributed to the exodus of people to other districts owing to the impending famine. In Rae Bareli and Farrukhabad- Fatehgarh it was due to slackness on the part of vaccinators. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in the municipalties of these provinces in 1913-14 was 82,275, vide Appendix B, against 82,789 in 1912-13 and 80,205 in 1911-12. Vaccination in cantonments. 14. During the year under report 12,841 persons were vaccinated and 13,102 vaccinations performed in cantonments, the difference of 261 representing secondary operations against 13,172, 13,313 and 141 respectively in 1912-13 and 10,360, 10,524 and 164 in 1911-12. The numbers of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population during the three years were 53.87, 52.28 and 47.52 respectively. Vaccination in notified areas. 15. The total number of persons vaccinated in these areas in 1913-14 was 15,284 as against 14,599 in 1912-13 and 13,341 in 1911-12. The total number of vaccinations was 15,677 as compared with 14,908 in the previous year and 13,508 in 1911-12 Secondary vaccinations rose from 167 in 1911-12 to 309 in 1912-13 and to 393 in 1913-14. Successful primary vaccinations were 13,409 against 12,714 in 1912-13 and 11,825 in 1911-12. There were 787 successful revaccinations in 1911-12 821 in 1912-13 and 719 last year. Successful vaccinations per mille of population rose from 37.93 in 1911-12 to 40.70 in 1912-13 and to 42.49 in 1913-14. Amongst the best protected notified areas, Mainpuri Civil Station stands first with 243.49 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population followed by Shahganj (Jaunpur) with 153.06, Deoria (Gorakhpur) with 87.45 Badshahpur (Jaunpur) with 80.48, Sheopur (Benares) with 79.82 and Gaura Barhaj (Gorakhpur) with 77.84. Chunar Settlement (Mirzapur) heads the list of the notified areas showing the least protection with 7.26 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population. Bagpat (Meerut) comes next
( 6 ) with 14.69. Then in order come Gorakhpur (18.28), Kaimganj and Kanauj in the Farrukhabad district (24.33 and 24.80 respectively) and Shikohabad in the Mainpnri district (25.48). All these areas except Chunar Settlement, Bagpat and Kanauj show an improvement over the preceding year. Vaccination Act. 16. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and cantonments and in 40 notified areas but the provisions are enforced with a varying degree of energy in different localities amongst which Agra is conspicuous for its slackness. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 17. The total number of vaccinations inspected by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and the District Superintendents of Vaccination in 1913-14 was 241,609 (including 11,219 vaccinations performed in previous year and not shown in Statement V)( 7 ) percentage (6980), followed by Naini Tal with 68.40, Dehra Dun with 6639 and Jalaun with 62.81. The districts showing low percentages are Kheri (25.20), Moradabad (26.85), Meerut (28.53), Hardoi (29.80) and Saharanpur (29.92). Of these, Moradabad, Meerut and Saharanpur show an improvement over the preceding year. Out of 49,683 revaccinations inspected by the assistant superintendents of vaccination or other inspecting officers, the largest numbers were inspected in Garhwal (16,498), Naini Tal (8,245) and Almora (6,456). Very few revaccinations were inspected in Jaunpur, Lucknow, Mirzapur, Bareilly, Bara Banki and Muttra and none in Meerut and Ghazipur. The attention of the District Superintendents of Vaccination concerned will be directed to the matter. For the purposes of comparison with the statistics of the triennium under report the statistics of the Benares State have been excluded from the figures of the preceding triennial period. Provincial bovine lymph depot at Patwa Dangar. (Naini Tal dis- trict.) 18. Work at the dépôt at Patwa Dangar has yearly increased since its- commencement in 1904-5. This is clearly shown in the following table, which gives the yearly output of lymph, the areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure :( 8 ) milk and calves, &c.,) against Rs. 24,019 in 1912-13 and Rs. 18,780 in 1911-12, although the price of lymph issued in bulk was reduced from Rs. 3 to Rs. 2 per drachm in 1911-12. Rs. 50 worth lymph was issued free of cost in 1913- 4 against Rs. 31 in 1912-13 and Rs. 68 in 1911-12. During the year 1913-14 no difficulty was experienced in obtaining a sufficient supply of calves, except towards the end of January and beginning of February when the contractor became implicated in a criminal suit and failed in his1 contract. In order to keep up the supply it became necessary to procure calves on hire from villages neighbouring on the dépôt. Four hundred and twenty calves (173 cow and 247 buffalo) including 11 left over from the last year and four born in the dépôt, were received in the dépôt during 1913-14 against 423 and 402 respectively in 1912-13 and 1911-12. Of these, 387 calves (168 cow and 219 buffalo) were vaccinated, 7 buffalo calves died of diseases other than rinderpest, of which there was happily no outbreak at the dépôt during the year, and 27 (6 cow and 21 buffalo) left unvaccinated at the close of the year. Out of these 387 calves, 371 proved successful and 16 failed or yielded lymph which was considered unfit for issue. In 1912-13, 423 calves were received in the dépôt and 24 died of rinderpest. Three hundred and eighty- six calves were vaccinated, of which 355 proved successful, 20 failed and 11 were found to yield lymph of such poor quality that it was not used for vacci- nation. In 1911-12 out of 387 vaccinated calves, 370 proved successful and 17 failed. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained in 1913-14 was 14,716.8 grammes against 11,285.0 grammes in 1912-13 and 9,335.6 grammes in 1911-12. The average yield in 1913-14 was 29.0 grammes per cow calf and 48.0 grammes per buffalo calf against 22.1 and 51.7 grammes respectively in 1912-13 and 19.9 and 36.6 grammes in 1911-12. Some of the buffalo calves supplied by the contractor in 1913-14 were well over one year of age and yielded comparatively small amounts of lymph ; this fact accounts for the reduction in the quantity of lymph obtained from buffalo calves during the year under report as compared with 1912-13. From the 14,716.8 grammes of crude lymph, 80,774.9 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 2,233.8 grammes of glycerine paste were prepared in 1913-14 against 69,742.0 grammes of lymph and 1,256.4 grammes of paste prepared in 1912-13 and 50,910.8 grammes of lymph and 1,606.3 grammes of paste in 1911-12. As there was no demand for lanoline paste in the triennium under report, none was prepared. The total number of primary vaccinations performed in these provinces with calf lymph in 1913-14 was 1,297,442 and that of revaccinations 77,406 as compared with 1,106,205 and 76,575 respectively in 1912-13 and 764,699 and 48,514 in 1911-12. Returns of results have been received for 619,039 primary operations and 46,931 revaccinations (excluding unknown cases) and these show a percentage success of 81.5 and 51.2 respectively during the period from April to September 1913 (hot weather) and 94.8 and 69.8 during the period from October 1913 to March 1914 (cold weather) against 89.4, 46.8, 96.8 and 71.6 respectively in 1912-13 and 90.7, 44.2, 97.1 and 65.3 respectively in 1911-12. The strain of lymph was satisfactory and in order to keep up its potency it was from time to time fortified by passage through rabbits. The dépôt was frequently inspected by the Sanitary Commissioner and Captain C. L. Dunn, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd range, who held charge of the institution until he went home on leave early in November 1913. A resident European Superintendent was appointed from 4th November 1912. An additional mali and four additional permanent coolies were appointed in 1913-14, bringing the total of coolies up to 10. The pay of the clerical and vaccination staff was also increased from 1st April 1913. A special grant of Rs. 50,000 has been made by the Government of India for the improvement of the dépôt. These improvements will include a cold storage installation and the construction of new calf operating and storage rooms which are urgently required. General remarks. 19. Vaccination during the triennium under report as compared with the preceding triennial period has been satisfactory. Hitherto the vaccination season commenced from 15th September and extended till 15th April( 9 ) collection of returns from vaccinators. Now that arm-to-arm vaccination in most of the districts has been replaced by the use of calf lymph, there is no necessity for the retention of the last 15 days of September in the vaccination season especially as in the latter half of this month the percentage of success is low owing to the heat at this season of the year. In view of these facts instructions were issued in 1913-14 to the districts, in which calf lymph alone is used, to postpone the commencement of vaccination until the 1st of October. The results have fully justified the change in dates. Although in several districts where the number of vaccinations was less than last year, the change of procedure has been assigned as the cause of decrease, the total number of persons vaccinated in 1913-14 exceeds that of 1912-13 by 60,573. The use of the tincture of iodine in vaccination as recommended by Major E. E. Waters, I.M.S., late Civil Surgeon, Hooghly, was tried on 188 children vaccinated in the Lucknow district. The District Superintendent of Vaccination reported that none of these operations was successful although the same lymph without the preliminary application of iodine to the arms produced successful results. In the Kheri district printed rubkars and parwanas in vernacular were issued under the signature of the District Officer to leading official and non-official gentlemen, asking them to assist in vaccination. All ziladars and patwaris were required to prepare lists of all children and adolescents available for vaccination in each village. These lists contained names of boys from 6 weeks to 18 years of age and of girls from 6 weeks to 12 years of age, who had escaped vaccination in previous years. This innovation proved of great service in furthering the cause of vaccination and the District Officers in general may be recommended to adopt this procedure. Copies of the rubkar and parwana in vernacular are appended to this report. Conduct of vaccination staff. 20. The conduct of the officials was on the whole satisfactory. S. A.

( 2 ) ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 79C/XVI( 2 ) Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Mirzapur and Allahabad. In Gorakhpur however it is satisfactory to note that the number of successful vaccinations rose considerably in 1913-14. 3. There would appear to be considerable room for improvement as far as the vaccination of children is concerned. In the review on the last triennial report a decrease in the number of vaccinations as compared with the number of births was noted. Even more marked was the decrease in the number of operations on children over one year and under six years of age. In respect of children under one year of age there has been little variation from the figures of the last year of the preceding triennium. It is true that there has been an increase in the actual number of operations on infants, and that the low percentage is due to the unusually high birth-rates that have been recorded during the last three years, but an effort needs to be made to increase this percentage. The high birth-rate of these three years does not have the same effect on the proportion of children between one and six years of age vaccinated, and in this case the percentage of each year of the period under review is lower than the lowest percentage recorded during the previous six years. The following figures, taken from the Sanitary Commissioner's reports for 1912 and 1913, also serve to point out the importance of the revaccination and vaccination of children. Deaths from small-pox. Infants. Children under 10. Adults. 1912 1,177 1,538 386 1913 2,936 4,352 868 4. The amount of work performed by each vaccinator shows a considerable increase. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator was 1,801 in 1913-14, and the average for the whole triennium was 1,717, as against 1,532 for the preceding three years. 5. The average annual expenditure on vaccination during the triennium was Rs. 2,19,823, as against Rs. 1,71,444 for the years 1908 to 1911. The increase is due to an increase in the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, two additional officers of this class having been appointed to these provinces in 1912, to the increased expenditure in the Patwa Dangar lymph dépôt, and to the improvement in the pay of the vaccinating staff. The pay of 2nd and 3rd grade assistant superintendents was raised in 1912 from Rs. 24 and 18 to Rs. 35 and 30 respectively, and at the same time considerable improvements in the pay of vaccinators were introduced. The average cost of each successful operation, excluding the cost of the lymph dépôt and the pay of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their establishment, was one anna nine pies, as against one anna seven pies for the preceding triennium. The cost compares favourably with that in other provinces. 6. The 18th paragraph of the report gives a very satisfactory record of the work of the Patwa Dangar lymph dépôt, which has made rapid strides in recent years. Arm-to-arm vaccination is now only carried on in nine districts in the province, and has been replaced by calf lymph
( 3 ) vaccination in all the municipalities and notified areas. The dépôt supplied lymph to six districts in the province of Behar and Orissa. 7. The number of inspections by all inspecting officers shows a very considerable improvement, and the work done by the staff generally is worthy of commendation. The thanks of Government are due to Lieutenant-Colonel Harriss for his full report. A system of sanads and parwanas for distribution to gentlemen who have furthered the cause of vaccination has been recently introduced. His Honour has been interested to read the account of the new system for assisting the progress of vaccination which has been introduced in the Kheri district, and the question of adopting it in other districts will be considered.

[Prescribed maximum lengthERRATUM slip to the Notes on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the year ending 31st March, 1915. Page. ForNotes on vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1914-15. Brief notes on vaccination in 1914-15. A detailed report for the triennial period 1911-12 to 1913-14 having been submitted last year, these notes deal briefly with vaccination in 1914-15 as compared with 1913-14. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) 2. There was no change in the constitution of the department during 1914-15. The total number of vaccinators in 1914-15 was 925 against 921 in 1913-14. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. The total expenditure on vaccination in 1914-15, including the charges on account of the deputy sanitary commissioners and their offices, was Rs. 2,47,622 and excluding these charges, was Rs. 2,07,168, against Rs. 2,53,619 and Rs. 2,01,559 respectively in the preceding year. The decrease in expenditure incurred on account of deputy sanitary commissioners was due to the fact that two I.M.S. deputy sanitary commissioners reverted to military duty during the year under report on account of war and the increase in expenditure on vaccination is chiefly accounted for by the increased expenditure on the Govern- ment bovine lymph dépôt at Patwa Dangar consequent on the extension of its operations as explained in paragraph 17. Owing to the resettlement of the finances of district boards in consequence of the transfer to the boards of the local rates previously appropriated for expenditure on rural police, the main heads of the boards' expenditure were standardized, vide G. O. no. 856/IX( 2 ) the number of secondary vaccinations was 10,835 against 20,815 in the preceding year from which, if the vaccinators have conscientiously reported secondary insertions, it can be inferred that lymph was of better quality than in previous years, as noted in paragraph 17. The number and percentage of successful primary- cases in which the results were known were 1,482,778 and 97.35 in 1914-15 as compared with 1,451,230 and 96.08 respectively in 1913-14. The number and percentage of successful revaccinations were 73,295 and 71.76 in 1914-15 as compared with 84,681 and 72.44 respectively in 1913-14. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator in 1914-15 was 1,784 against 1,801 in the preceding year and the numbers of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population were 33.22 and 32.79 respectively. It would thus appear that there was an increase under all the heads shown above except in revaccinations and the average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator. Successful primary vaccination in different districts. (Statement I.) 6. Thirty-eight districts out of 48 show an increase in the number of successful primary operations in 1914-15 over 1913- 14. Agra heads the list with an increase of 3,778 and is followed by Gorakhpur with 3,300, Azamgarh with 3,226, Meerut with 2,803, Bahraich with 2,339 and Ballia with 2,281. Of the 10 districts showing a decline, Budaun shows a marked decrease of 5,333. Rae Bareli comes next with 2,723, followed by Bareilly with 2,194, Moradabad with 1,949, Gonda with 724, Banda with 630 and Naini Tal with 524. In Budaun and Naini Tal the decrease is stated to be due to low birth-rate and in Rae Bareli to prevalence of small-pox and cholera and to the employment of vaccinators on cholera duty. In Bareilly it is ascribed to low birth-rate, to high mortality and to the deputation of five experienced vaccinators in March 1915 to Hardwar for Kumbh fair duty and to the appointment of only three new men as substitutes. In Moradabad the deputation of the assistant superintendent of vaccination and five vaccinators to Hardwar for fair duty is put forward as a cause of decrease in work. In Gonda the staff was reduced by one vaccinator. In Banda the decrease is said to be due to illness of a vaccinator and slackness of two vaccinators, who have been punished, and to the fact that in 1913-14 famine camps brought together a large number of people and vaccinators were thus able to do larger amount of work in one place, time was thus not lost in travelling from village to village. Successful vaccination and degree of protection afforded. ( Statement I.) 7. In 34 districts, out of 48, the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population in 1914-15 exceeded that of 1913-14 and in 20 it exceeded the provincial average (33 22). Garhwal, as usual, heads the list of the best protected districts with 77.15 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of popula- tion and is followed by Almora with 63.65, Naini Tal with 59.16, Jhansi with 48.35, Hamirpur with 46.96, Dehra Dun with 44.32, Hardoi with 41.04 and Jalaun with 40.92. Of these Garhwal, Naini Tal and Jhansi show a falling off as compared with the preceding year. Of the 28 districts showing a low number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population the most conspicuous are Farrukhabad with 21.99, Bara Banki with 22.88, Sultanpur with 24.74 and Unao with 26.27. Of these Sultanpur shows a slight improvement over the preceding- year and the other districts retain practically the same position. Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 8. It is satisfactory to note that in 1914-15, the percentage of successful operations on persons of all ages in proportion to births was higher than in the preceding year, the percentages being 48.48 for children under one year of age, 19.96 for children between the ages of one and six years and 70.45 for all periods against 45.37, 1766 and 64.99 respectively in the preceding year. Taking the figures for the different ranges separately, it is seen that the number of successful operations on children under one year of age in proportion to births in the first range was 60.61 per cent. in 1914-15 against 56.77 per cent. in 1913-14. In the second range the percentages were 40.11 and 36.75, in the third range 48.73 and 47.99 and in the fourth range 40.76 and 37.81 respectively. Mortality from small-pox. 9. The death-rate from small-pox in 1914 was .38 per mille of population against .17 in 1913 and .08, the quinquennial average. Diagram. 10. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district is attached.
( 3 ) Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 11. The number of vaccinations performed by medical subordinates at dispensaries in 1914-15 was 348 (220 primary and 128 revaccinations) against 629 in the preceding year. The causes of decrease under this head have been explained in previous reports. Vaccination in municipalities. 12. The municipalities of Kosi (Muttra) and Sardhana (Meerut) having been converted into notified areas from 1st April 1914, the number of municipalities was reduced from 86 to 84 and that of notified areas increased from 46 to 48 during the year under report. For the purposes of comparison the statistics of these two towns for the preceding year have therefore been excluded from those for the municipal areas and included in those for the notified areas. In 1914-15 the total number (a) of persons vaccinated in the municipalities of these provinces was 126,585, (b) of vaccinations performed 127,952 including 1,367 seoondary vaccinations, (c) of successful primary vaccinations 105,253, (d) of successful revaccinations 7,739 and (e) of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population 38.47 against (a) 122,661, (b) 125,136 including 2,475 secondary vaccinations, (c) 100,314, (d) 8,132 and (e) 36.98 respectively in the preceding year. The municipal vaccination work during the year 1914-15 thus shows an improvement over the preceding year under all heads except revaccinations. Naini Tal heads the list of best protected municipalities with 148 83 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population and is followed by Jaunpur with 103.34, Almora with 79.02, Gonda with 67.40, Lakhimpur (Kheri) with 67.01 and Mau (Jhansi) with 61.65. Of the least protected municipalities the most conspiouous are Rae Bareli with 17.43, Farrukhabad cum Fatehgarh with 19.74, Nawabganj (Bara Banki) with 21.31, Fyzabad-Ajodhya with 25.44 and Brindaban (Muttra) with 26.30. All these municipalities with the exception of Fyzabad-Ajodhya show an improvement over the preceding year. In Fyzabad-Ajodhya the decrease is stated to be due to the prevalence of plague in the latter part of the year. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in the municipalities of these provinces in 1914-15 was 85,085, vide Appendix B, against 81,670 in 1913-14. Vaccination in cantonments. 13. The total number (a) of persons vaccinated in the cantonments of these provinces during 1914-15 was 12,930, (b) of vaccinations performed 13,094, including 164 secondary vaccinations, (c) of successful primary vaccinations 7,874, (d) of successful revaccinations 2,697 and (e) of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population 55.24, against (a) 12,841, (b) 13,102, including 261 secondary revaccinations, (c) 7,041, (d) 3,267 and (e) 53.87 respectively in the preceding year. As in the case of municipalities, there was an increase under all the above heads except revaccinations in the cantonment areas in 1914-15. Vaccination in notified areas. 14. During the year under review 15,875 persons were vaccinated and 16,113 vaccinations performed in the 48 notified areas of these provinces against 16,014 and 16,422 respectively in 1913-14, the difference of 238 and 408 representing secondary operations. The number of successful primary vaccinations rose from 14,111 in 1913-14 to 14,711 in 1914-15 and the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population from 42.50 to 43.46. Mainpuri civil station again stands first among the best protected notified areas with 244.16 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, followed by Shahganj and Badshahpur (Jaunpur) with 148.99 and 91.63 respectively, Ahraura (Mirzapur) with 83.11, Sheopur (Benares) with 79.21 and Fatehpur-Sikri (Agra) with 76.48. Among the worst protected notified areas the most conspicuous are Chunar Settlement (Mirzapur) with 2.90 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population, Rajpur (Dehra Dun) with 15.41, Shahdara (Meerut) with 18.99 and Kaimganj (Farrukhabad) with 22 99. All these areas show a falling off as compared with the preceding year . Vaccination Act. 15. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and cantonments and in 40 notified areas. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 16. During 1914-15 the deputy sanitary commissioners and the district superintendents of vaccination inspected 219,068 vaccinations (including 6,014 vaccinations performed in the preceding year and not shown in Statement V)( 4 ) revaccinations (including 22 done in previous year)( 5 ) The average yield of crude lymph in 1914-15 per cow calf was 28.6 grammes and that per buffalo calf 54.5 grammes as compared with 29.0 and 48.0 grammes respectively in 1913-14. The average yield of lymph per cow calf was practically the same as in the preceding year but that from a buffalo calf was much larger. From the 19,237.2 grammes of crude lymph 108,932.4 grammes of glyceri- nated lymph, 2,408 2 grammes of glycerine paste and 8.5 grammes of lanoline paste were prepared whereas in the preceding year 80,744.9 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 2,233.8 grammes of glycerine paste were prepared. The lymph issued from the dépôt in 1914-15 was always chloroformed for 40 minutes except when the water supply to the dépôt was interrupted. During the year under report Benares, Allahabad, Jaunpur and Mirzapur were added to the districts in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been entirely replaced by calf lymph vaccination, bringing the total of districts using calf lymph to 41. Ghazipur and Fatehpur, as in the preceding year, purchased only small quantities of lymph. With the resettlement of the finances of district boards and consequent standardization of the main heads of expenditure referred to in paragraph 3 above, the remaining seven districts including Ghazipur and Fatehpur, are expected to purchase calf lymph from the current year and to do away with the arm-to-arm vaccination. The cost of lymph supplied to the district boards in these provinces amounted to Rs. 17,521 in 1914-15 against Rs. 16,042 in the preceding year. As noted above, there were 84 municipalities and 48 notified areas during the year 1914-15 and all of them purchased their supplies of lymph regularly during the season, the cost amounting to Rs. 6,098 against Rs. 6,376 in 1913-14. Several native states, court of wards, cantonments, private persons and the medical officer, East Indian Railway, also purchased lymph to the value of Rs. 2,949 against Rs. 3,228 in the preceding year. The military department now pay Rs. 700 annually for the lymph supplied to them. In the province of Bihar and Orissa ten districts, the lymph dépôt at Namkum and the Dinapore hospital purchased lymph to the value of Rs. 9,192 against Rs. 465 in 1913-14. As a lymph dépôt has now been established at Namkum, the supply of lymph to this province has been stopped. The sale proceeds of lymph from the dépôt in 1914-15 thus amounted to Rs. 36,460 and those of milk and calves, &c., to Rs. 2,714 (total Rs. 39,174) against Rs. 26,757 and Rs. 2,110 (total Rs. 28,867) respectively in 1913-14, an increase of Rs. 10,307. Rupees 61 worth lymph was issued free against Rs. 50 in 1913-14. In expenditure on the dépôt there was an increase of only Rs. 3,275 over the preceding year, the amounts being Rs. 20,522, and Rs. 17,247 respectively. This increase is easily explained by (a) the increase in the number of calves purchased and hired, (b) increased expenditure on contingencies and stores consequent upon the increased supply of lymph and (c) increase in the pay of the superintendent. The annual output of lymph and the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the dépôt are shown in the table below :( 6 ) The total number of primary vaccinations performed with calf lymph in these provinces during 1914-15 was 1,405,330 and that of revaccinations 64,640 against 1,297,442 and 77,406 respectively in 1913.14. Returns of results have been received for 738,025 primary operations and 39,741 revaccinations (excluding unknown cases) and these show a percentage success of 90'5 and 59.1 respectively during the period from April to September 1914 (hot weather) and 97.6 and 73 9 during the period from October 1914 to March 1915 (cold weather) against 81.5, 51.2, 94.8 and 69.8 respectively in 1913-14. The results are shown in the following table and are very satisfactory justifying the delay in the commencement of vaccination season from September 15th to October 1st. The percentage success of 97.6 primary and 73.9 revaccination have never been previously attained :Diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district of the united Provinces . The black lines and figures indicate proportion of population protected by vaccination during the year 1914-15 and the six years preceding it The red lines and figures indicate the death-rate from small-pox during 1914.

[Prescribed maximum lengthErratum slip to the Notes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year ending 31st March, 1916. Page. ForNotes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1915-16. General. Sixty-five revenue estates, inclusive of Shahdara notified area, comprising of an area of 45 square miles with a population of 14,552 souls, were transferred from the Meerut district to the Delhi province on 1st April, 1915, vide Government of India notification No. 984C dated the 22nd February 1915. The area and population of the Meerut district were thus reduced from 2,344 square miles and 1,519,364 to 2,299 square miles and 1,504,812 respectively and those of the province from 106,402 square miles and 46,835,108 to 106,357 square miles and 46,820,556 respectively. Strength of vaccination staff. (Statement II.) 2. The number of assistant superintendents of vaccination remained unaltered during the year but the number of vaccinatorse mployed was reduced from 925 in 1914-15 to 887 in the year under report. This latter number includes apprentices appointed in several districts according to the scale sanctioned by Government. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. In 1915-16 the expenditure on vaccination including the charges on account of deputy sanitary commissioners and their offices amounted to Rs. 2,41,602 and excluding these charges to Rs. 2,14,659 as compared with Rs. 2,47,803 and 2,07,349 respectively in the preceding year. The decrease in expenditure on account of deputy sanitary commissioners was due to the fact that the posts of the two I. M. S. deputy sanitary commissioners, who reverted to military duty in 1914, remained vacant throughout the year. The increased expenditure under other heads is accounted for by (a) the application during 1915-16 of the standard fixed for vaccination charges, at an increased cost estimated at Rs. 33,000 referred to in paragraph 3 of the notes for 1914-15, (b) the grant of horse allowance to assistant superintendents of vaccination, (c) the purchase of bovine lymph by a larger number of districts, (d) the supply of new badges to vaccinators, and (e) enhanced expenditure on the bovine lymph dépôt, Patwa Dangar, as explained in paragraph 17. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 4. In 1915-16 the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces was two annas against one anna and eleven pies last year. The increase under this head is accounted for by the increased expenditure on vaccination as explained above and by the smaller number of vaccinations performed in 1915-16 than in 1914-15. Compared with other provinces, the United Provinces stand third in the low cost as shown below. The cost of successful vaccination per head has increased in Bihar and Orissa by 3 pies, in the North-West Frontier Province by two pies, and in the United Provinces by one pie, in 1915-16 as compared with last year:( 2 ) General operations. (Statement I.) 5. During the year under review 1,615,558 persons were vaccinated( 3 ) Mortality from small-pox. 9. In 1915 the mortality from small-pox per mille of population was .05 as compared with .38 in the preceding year and .13 the quinquennial average. Diagram. 10. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small- pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district is appended. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 11. There was a decrease of 164 in the number of vaccinations performed at dispensaries in 1915-16 as compared with 1914-15, the actual numbers being 184 (139 primary and 45 re-vaccination) and 348 respectively. The figures show a steady decline since 1913-14. The causes of decrease under this head have been explained in previous reports. Vaccination in municipalities. 12. During the year under review the municipal vaccination work, like the district work, also shows a falling off and the reasons given for decrease in districts mostly apply to that in municipalities. Only 118,308 persons were vaccinated in the muncipalities of these provinces as compared with 126,585 in the preceding year and the total numbers of vaccination operations performed were 120,016 (108,132 primary and 11,884 re-vaccinations) and 127,952 respectively, the difference of 1,708 and 1,367 representing secondary vaccinations. The successful primary vaccinations num- bered 102,570 and successful re-vaccinations 6,110 as compared with 105,253 and 7,739 respectively in 1914-15. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 36.99 against 38.47 in the preceding year. Among the municipalities showing a large number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population, Jaunpur (110.24) stands first. Naini Tal with 82.60 comes next and is followed by Lakhimpur (Kheri) with 61.59, Gonda with 60.79, Koil (Aligarh) with 55.18 and Bahraich with 54.52. The municipalities showing a small number of persons vaccinated per 1,000 of population were Rae Bareli (18.98), Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh (19.71), Fyzabad-Ajodhya (22.89), Dehra (23.66) and Jhansi (25.00). All these municipalities except Jaunpur, Bahraich and Rae Bareli show a decline. The vaccinations successfully performed on children under one year of age in the municipalities of these provinces in 1915-16 numbered 82,361 against 85,085 in the preceding year and are shown in Appendix B. Vaccination in cantonments. 13. In 1915-16,11,913 persons were vaccinated and 12,065 vaccination operations (8,023 primary and 4,042 re-vaccination) performed in the cantonments of these provinces against 12,930 and 13,094 respectively in the preceding year, the difference of 152 and 164 representing secondary vaccinations. The successful primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations and persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population numbered 7,433, 2,288 and 50.80 respectively as compared with 7,874, 2,697 and 55.24 in 1914-15. There was thus a decrease under all the above heads in cantonments in 1915-16 as in municipalities but taking into consideration the special circumstances on account of the war the results are not unsatisfactory. Vaccination in notified areas. 14. The Bhim Tal-Sat Tal settlement in the Naini Tal district was constituted a notified area in 1915-16, but statistics not having been separately recorded are not available. As explained in paragraph 1 above, the notified area of Shahdara (Meerut) having been transferred to the Delhi province, there were 47 notified areas during the year under review. For the purposes of comparison, the statistics of Shahdara for the preceding year have been excluded from those quoted here. The total numbers of persons vaccinated and vaccinations performed in the 47 notified areas during 1915-16 were 16,169 and 16,370 (15,321 primary and 1,049 re-vaccination) respectively against 15,777 and 16,015 in the same areas during the preceding year( 4 ) Vaccination Act. 15. The Vaccination Act is in force in all municipalities and cantonments and in 41 notified areas. The rules are enforced with a varying degree of energy in different localities. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 16. The total number of vaccinations inspected by the deputy sanitary commissioners and the district superintendents of vaccination in 1915-16 was 231,067 (223,148 primary and 7,919 re-vaccinations) against 219,068 in the preceding year. The deputy sanitary commissioners also inspected 927 vaccinations in the schools. These are not shown in statement V. The percentage of inspections to the total number vaccinated was 14.77 in the case of primary vaccination and 7.57 for re-vaccination against 13.33 and 7.91 respectively in 1914-15, whereas the percentage of cases found successful to the total number of primary operations inspected in 1915-16 was 96.61 and that for re-vaccination 69.82 as against 97.29 and 57.03 respectively. Among the districts showing a large number of inspections, Azamgarh again stands first with 19,788 and is followed by Jaunpur with 13,348, Bulandshahr with 12,455, Mainpuri with 9,932 and Pilibhit with 9,588. All these districts show an improvement over the preceding year. No inspections were made in the districts of Dehra Dun, Meerut, Agra, Lucknow, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Benares, and very few (238) in Gorakhpur. In all these districts except Meerut the district superintendents of vaccination are not required to make tours for the inspection of vaccination. In Meerut the civil surgeon having reverted to military duty only held collateral charge of the office of district superintendent of vaccination and could not therefore leave the station. The total number of vaccinations inspected by assistant superintendents of vaccination and other inspecting officers in 1915-16 was 684,089 (640,705 primary and 43,384 re-vaccination) as compared with 668,766 in 1914-15( 5 ) 27 died subsequently. There were thus 34 deaths amongst calves in 1915-16. Of these, 22 occurred from pleuro-pneumonia, six from akra, one from haemorrhagic septicimia, one from black quarter, one by eating poisonous grass, one from weakness, one from snake-bite and one from fall from a hill. To check the spread of haemorrhagic septicimia, the services of a veterinary inspector and a veterinary assistant were secured and all calves inoculated against this disease. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained from the 358 calves successfully vaccinated during the year under report was 16,868.7 grammes, i. e. 47.1 grammes per calf as against 19,237.2 grammes obtained from 538 calves or 35.7 grammes per calf in 1914-15. The average yield per calf was thus larger in 1915-16 than the preceding year by 11.4 grammes, which is very satisfactory. From this crude lymph 95,519.7 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 2,236'5 grammes of glycerine paste were prepared whereas in the preceding year 108,932.4 grammes of glycerinated lymph, 2,408.2 grammes of glycerine paste, and 8.5 grammes of lanoline paste were prepared. There being no demand for lanoline paste during the year under report, none was prepared. The decrease in the quantity of lymph manufactured at, and issued from, the dépôt in 1915-16 as compared with 1914-15 is chiefly due to the fact that a lymph dépôt having been established at Namkum in the province of Bihar and Orissa, the supply of lymph to the districts of that province, the Namkum lymph dépôt, and the Dinapur hospital was no longer required. These districts and institutions purchased 121,355 tubes of lymph and 24,504 grammes in bulk, costing Rs. 9,192, from this dépôt in 1914-15. Against this loss of sale it was expected last year that the seven districts of these provinces, namely Mainpuri, Cawnpore, Bahraich, Almora Garhwal, Ghazipur, and Fatehpur, still retaining arm-to-arm vaccination would adopt calf-lymph vaccination in 1915-16. This expectation has been fulfilled except in the case of Garhwal, which for want of funds retains the arm-to-arm method of vaccination, but the income from these districts does not compensate the loss incurred by the stoppage of sales to Bihar and Orissa, even though 47 districts out of 48 purchased lymph from the dépôt in 1915-16 and the cost of this lymph amounted to Rs. 19,299 as against Rs. 17,521 in 1914-15. All the 84 municipalities and 47 (vide paragraph 14) notified areas purchased their supplies of lymph from the dépôt, but there was a further decline in the quantities purchased in 1915-16( 6 ) on Rs. 40 per month for driving engines and his deputation to Calcutta for training, (d) annual increments in the pay of the staff, and (e) purchase of a complete new outfit of langots and jhools for calves. The subjoined table shows the output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the dépôt for a series of years:population protected by [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

[Prescribed maximum lengthErratum slip to the Triennial report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, for the years 1914-15, 1915-16 and 1916-17. Page ForTriennial report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1914-15, 1915-16 and 1916-17. Period covered by the report. This report has been drawn up to cover the triennial period 1914-15 to 1916-17 with special reference, however, to the work of the last year as brief notes have already been submitted on the work of the preceding two years. Area and population. 2. During the triennium under report the Meerut district showed a decrease in its area from 2,344 to 2,299 square miles with a corresponding fall in the population from 1,519,364 to 1,504,812. There was thus a decrease in area and population of the provinces from 106,402 square miles and 46,835,108 souls to 106,357 square miles and 46,820,556 souls respectively. The decrease was due to the transfer of 65 revenue estates inclusive of Shahdara notified area to the Delhi Province on 1st April, 1915. Officers in charge of the depart- ment. 3. The charge of the office of Sanitary Commissioner and Superintendent General of Vaccination was held by me for the triennium under review except for the period from 29th January to 25th February, 1916, during which I was on privilege leave and Dr. D. D. Pandya held charge in addition to his own duties. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) 4. The charge of the first range was held from the 1st April, to the 28th October, 1914, by Major E. Bisset, I.M.S., who reverted to military duty on the latter date, from the 29th October, 1914, to 31st March, 1915, by me in addition to my own duties and from the 1st April, 1915, to the end of the triennium by Dr. D. D. Pandya, who, in addition, held charge of the fourth range for the whole of the triennium. Major E. Bisset, I.M.S., also held additional charge of the second range from the 1st April to the 28th October, 1914. Captain (now Major) C. L. Dunn, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, second range, was granted leave out of India up to the 20th October, 1914, on which date he reverted to military duty and Dr. K. L. Nehru, held charge of the third range from the 1st April, 1914, and additional charge of the second range from 29th October, 1914, to the 20th February, 1916, when he resigned and was succeeded by Dr. A. Sousa, who held the charge of these two ranges from the 21st February, 1916, to the close of the period under report. During the triennium under review the number of assistant superintendents of vaccination remained unaltered (49). The Government, however, in their order no. 310/XVI( 2 ) funds, Rs. 29,686 by municipalities and Rs. 4,479 by Native States (including Court of Wards and private persons) against Rs. 1,40,943, Rs. 65,645, Rs. 29,786 and Rs. 4,996, in 1915-16 and Rs. 1,52,411, Rs. 60,100, Rs. 29,881 and Rs. 5,411, in 1914-15 respectively. The cause of the decrease in expenditure on account of deputy sanitary commissioners is due to the reversion to military duty of two I. M. S. deputy sanitary commissioners. The total expenditure on vaccination in 1916-17, although greater than that for the last year, was less than that incurred in the year before last. The increase in the expenditure in the year under report as compared with the last year is to be attributed to (1) enhanced expenditure on the Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, as explained in paragraph 19, (2) the erection of a new vaccination station in the Mussoorie municipality and (3) the grade promotion of vaccinators and the entertainment of paid apprentices in some districts. Average cost of each success- ful case of vaccination. (Statement II.) 6. In 1916-17, the average cost of each successful case of vaccination in these provinces was two annas, i.e., exactly the same as in 1915-16, and a little over than that of 1914-15 (one anna and eleven pies)( 3 ) triennium under report was 108.150 as against 118,723 for the preceding triennial period. The number of successful re-vaccinations performed in 1916-17 was 73,286 against 71,540 in 1915-16 and 73,295 in 1914-15, the average for the triennial period being 72,707 against 80,535 for the preceding triennium. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator during the year under report was 1,801.29 as compared with 1,829.34 in 1915-16 and 1,784.15 in 1914-15, the average for the three years being 1,805 against 1,717 for the pre- ceding triennial period. On reference to appendix B it will be seen that in some towns municipal vaccinators do very little work. For example, Atrauli with two vaccinators each performs 301 vaccinations a year. Sikandra Rao with two vaccinators does 187.5 each. Hapur with two vaccinators does 335.5 each, Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh with two vaccinators doing 618 each. The municipal towns in which vaccinators have little work are as follows :( 4 ) A table showing the work done in the triennium under report as compared with the preceding triennium is appended:( 5 ) 1916-17, 1915-16 and 1914-15 respectively. The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated and the average annual death-rate from small-pox per mille of population during the five years previous to 1916-17 in the above four districts were Sultanpur 24.27 and .25, Bara Banki 22.65 and .07, Unao 25.94 and .21 and Partabgarh 27.91 and .25. Of these, Sultanpur has been noted as showing the lowest number of protected persons per mille of population in the preceding triennium, while Bara Banki in the preceding two trienniums. The latter has, however, now begun to show a slow but steady improvement over the last five years. Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 10. The percentage of successful vaccination operations in proportion to births continues to show an improvement( 6 ) The towns in which a large per cent. of children available for vaccination have not been vaccinated are as follows :( 7 ) is an increase in the total number of inspections made during the year under report as compared with the figures for the preceding two years. There would have been a still larger increase in the number but for the following reasons :( 8 ) As regards the percentage of inspections of primary operations, Dehra Dun tops the list of the districts returning high percentages with 74.95, followed by Garhwal with 73.82, Jalaun with 70.97, Pilibhit with 70.41 and Hamirpur with 65.93. Among the districts returning low percentages are Allahabad with 18.31, Farrukhabad with 27.00, Unao with 27.25, Budaun with 27.35 and Sitapur with 27.78. Of these, only Unao shows a slight improvement over the preceding year. Provincial Bovine Lymph Dépôt at Patwa Dangar (Naini Tal district). 19. I held the charge of the dépôt throughout the triennium (1914-15 to 1916-17) with the exception of the period mentioned in paragraph 3. Three hundred and seventy calves (138 cow and 232 buffalo) were obtained for vaccination at the dépôt in 1916-17 as against 382 and 571 in 1915-16 and 1914-15 respectively. The increase in the number of calves in 1914-15 as compared with 1915-16 and 1916-17 was due to the demand for a large quantity of lymph from the province of Bihar and Orissa. Of the 370 calves, 350 (134 cow and 216 buffalo) were successfully vacci- nated, 15 failed and 5 died unvaccinated or while under operation. Out of the 350 calves successfully vaccinated 31 died subsequently, bringing the total number of deaths up to 36. Of these, 23 calves died from &quot; pleuro-pneumonia,'' 5 from &quot;black quarter&quot; and 8 from other causes. The veterinary assistant of Haldwani was in attendance and inoculated some of the infected calves. The total yield of crude lymph from the 350 calves successfully vaccinated in 1916-17 amounted to 18,348 7 grammes or 52'4 grammes per calf against 16,868'7 grammes from 358 calves or 47.1 grammes per calf in 1915-16 and 19,237'2 grammes from 538 calves or 35.7 grammes per calf in 1914-15. It may be noted that the yield per calf in 1916-17 was the largest ever obtained. From the crude lymph (18,348.7 grammes), 106,577.5 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 1,188.5 grammes of grlycerine paste were prepared during the year under report as compared with 95,519.7 grammes and 2,236.5 grammes in last year and 108,932'4 and 2,408.2 grammes, in the year before last, respectively. There being no demand for lanoline paste, none was prepared in 1916-17 nor in 1915-16, and only 8.5 grammes were prepared in 1914-15. The annual output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm. vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the dépôt are shown in the subjoined table:( 9 ) Hardwar, Benares, Mirzapur-Bindhachal, Budaun, Sahaswan, Ujhani (both in the Budaun district), Sandila (Hardoi), Kalpi (Jalaun), Balrampur(Gonda) and Etawah obtained a smaller quantity of lymph. Lymph worth Rs. 19,807, Rs. 364 and Rs. 67 was supplied to the district boards, the East Indian Railway Company and private persons respectively in 1916-17 against Rs. 19,299, Rs. 348 and Rs. 38 respectively in 1915-16 and Rs. 17,521, Rs. 406 and Rs. 213 respectively in 1914-15. The quantity purchased by the district boards shows an increase over the preceding two years, while that supplied to the East Indian Railway Company and private persons an increase over 1915-16, but a marked decrease as compared with 1914-15. Several native states, Court of Wards, and cantonments also purchased lymph worth Rs. 2,585 as against Rs. 2,701 and Rs. 2,330 in 1915-16 and 1914-15 respectively. In the province of Bihar and Orissa lymph worth Rs. 15 was supplied to the Government Vaccine Dépôt, Namkum, in 1916-17 as against Rs. 5 worth supplied to Health Officer, Gaya, in 1915-16 and Rs. 9,192 worth lymph supplied to 10 districts, the Lymph dépôt at Namkum and the Dinapur hospital in 1914-15. With the calf lymph issued during the year 1916-17, 1,612,268 vaccination operations (1,526,937 primary and 85,331 re-vaccination) were performed as against 1,577,324 and 1,469,970 in 1915-16 and 1914-15 respectively, showing an increase of 34,944 and 142,298 over the preceding two years respectively. Returns of results have been received for 835,583 primary vaccinations and 55,725 re-vaccinations, excluding unknown cases, and show a percentage success of 94.0 in the case of the former and 57.3 in the case of the latter for the period from April to September, 1916 (hot weather) and 97.2 and 68.9 respectively for the period from October 1916 to March 1917 (cold weather) as compared with 91.8, 63.8, 96.9 and 71.1 in 1915-16 and 90.5, 59.1, 97.6 and 73.9 in 1914-15 respectively. The subjoined table shows that the results of primary operations in 1916-17 were better than in the preceding two years, but in case of re-vaccinations the results were not so satisfactory :( 10 ) large. The comfort and good fodder supply including grazing of the calves were also ensured. The average quantity of lymph per calf was the largest ever obtained at the dépôt. Contractor Muhammad Noor continued to supply calves to the dépôt during the year under report. No trouble was experienced with him this year, but the calves supplied by him were no better than those supplied in the previous years. It was only the better feeding (cut grass and ample grazing at Lalkua included) which brought them into good condition before vaccination. He was allowed to keep the sum of Rs. 1,000 which was advanced to him in October, 1915, for the purchase of calves and the amount was recovered from him by instalments and refunded into the Naini Tal treasury before 31st March, 1917. The strain of lymph was occasionally fortified by passage through rabbits, as usual, and proved satisfactory. The conduct and work of the officials of the dépôt was fairly satisfactory. The designations of head vaccinator, assistant vaccinator, head tube-filler, and assistant tube-filler have been altered to 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th laboratory assist- ants respectively. Printed rubkars and parwanas. 20. During the vaccination season of 1913-14 printed rubkars and parwanas in vernacular were issued to leading official and non-official gentlemen by the District Officer of Kheri with a view to improve vaccination work in that district. The details have been fully explained in the Annual Vaccination Report for that year. The further extension of this system is under the consideration of Government. It is hoped that if this system is followed in other districts vaccination will improve. Combined birth and vaccination registers. 21. Combined vaccination registers prescribed in 1914 to replace vaccina- tion registers I and II used in the municipalities, notified areas and cantonments have not yet been adopted by many local bodies. The necessity for their adoption can be seen from the remarks on defective vaccination in paragraph 14. Their attention has however been invited to the advantage of the new forms. Mode of vaccination. 22. From experience it was found that the method of vaccination on both arms caused inconvenience to both infants and adults, more especially the latter, the right arm being incapacitated for work for some days and that when re-vaccination was carried out the scarification was often made on the scar of the previous primary operation rendering the distinguishing of the primary from the re-vaccination scar difficult. With a view to obviating these difficulties a circular letter was issued with the approval of Government to all district superintendents of vaccination in the United Provinces, in June, 1916, directing that when two insertions were to be made, all primary and secondary vaccinations should be performed on the right arm only, while re-vaccinations were to be done on the left arm. District annual vaccination returns. 23. The district returns from some of the districts were again received late notwithstanding the issue of a circular to all district superintendents of vaccination from this office, well in advance of the date prescribed for their submission. Some returns from Meerut and Garhwal were received very late. S. A. HARRISS, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H.

No. 653C /XVI( 2 ) actually fallen, while the latter is still considerably above the average. The explanations offered for the decrease in the number of vaccinations performed in this district, are, as the Sanitary Commissioner observes, unsatisfactory. Very little improvement is shown by Bara Banki, the other district to which attention was drawn in this connection in the resolution on the report for the previous triennium. 3. The general increase in protection and decrease in mortality shown by the provincial figures, may, however, be noted with satisfac- tion. There has also been a satisfactory improvement as regards the vaccination of children, the figures showing an increase both for children under one year of age and for children between one and six. It is obvious, however, that in some municipalities the Act is not properly enforced. Sultanpur, where not a quarter of the children born in the year 1916-17 were vaccinated, is the worst in this respect; while in ten other municipalities 38 per cent. or over of the children born in the year remained unvaccinated. In Sultanpur only 258 vaccinations were performed in the year, which is actually the lowest figure for any municipality. The figures quoted on page 3 of the report show that in several municipalities and in most notified areas and cantonments the work done is not sufficient to occupy the whole time of the staff. 4. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator again shows a considerable increase. For the three years under report the average was 1,805 against 1,717 in the previous triennium. In a notification issued in June 1915, Government laid down that a vaccina- tor should ordinarily perform not less than 2,000 vaccinations in the season. Considering that in over 50 small towns the work done by each vaccinator did not amount to 400 vaccinations, the general average must be regarded as good. The number of inspections by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and district superintendents of vaccination decreased as a result of depletion of staff owing to the war, but the number of inspections made by assistant superintendents of vaccination increased considerably. 5. The average annual expenditure on vaccination again rose during the triennium from Rs. 2,19,823 to Rs. 2,44,608. The increase is due to increased expenditure on the bovine lymph dépôt at Patwa Dangar, to the erection of a new vaccination station in the Mussoorie municipality, and to grade promotions of vaccinators, and the entertainment of paid apprentices in some districts. 6. The system adopted in the Kheri district for assisting the progress of vaccination has been introduced in other districts of the province, but in order to avoid interference with the revenue duties of patwaris, it has been decided that the lists of children shall be prepared triennially and not annually. 7. The office of Superintendent-General of Vaccination has been held throughout the triennium, except for a short period of privilege leave, by Lieutenant-Colonel Harriss, to whom the thanks of Government are due for an interesting report.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNotes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1917-18. Brief notes on vaccination in 1917-18. As a detailed report for the triennial period 1914-15 to 1916-17 was submitted last year, this report deals briefly with vaccination in 1917-18, as compared with 1916-17. Constitution and strength, of the department. (Statement II.) 2. Lieutenant-Colonel S. A. Harriss, I.M.S. was Superintendent-General of Vaccination from the 1st April till the 25th of July 1917 when he reverted to military duty. I took over charge of the office of the Superintendent- General of Vaccination, United Provinces, in addition to my own duties, on the afternoon of 25th July 1917 and held it till the close of the year. Dr. D.D. Pandya, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, IV Range, and Dr. A. Sousa, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 3rd Range, held additional charge of the 1st and 2nd Ranges, respectively, throughout the year. The orders of Government regarding the appointment of a first grade assistant superintendent of vaccination in the Naini Tal District having been given effect to during the year under report, the number of 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade assistant superintendents of vaccination is now 9, 16 and 24, respectively. The total number of vaccinators in 1917-18 stood at 915, as compared with 916 in 1916-17. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 3. There was an increase of Rs. 2,735 in the total expenditure in 1917-18, including the charges on account of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their establishments, as compared with 1916-17, and of Rs. 2,097 excluding these charges( 2 ) respectively, in 1916-17. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vac- cinator in 1917-18 was 1,833, as compared with 1,801 in 1916-17, and the number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 33.95, against 33.44. It would thus appear that there was a fair increase in the vaccination work during the year under report. Successful primary vaccinations in different districts. (Statement I.). 6. Twenty-nine districts out of 48 show an increase in the number of suc- cessful primary operations performed in 1917-18 over that recorded in 1916-17. Sultanpur heads the list with a material increase of 7,080, followed by Farrukhabad with 4,134, Basti with 3,870, Lucknow with 3.694, Garhwal with 3,279, Moradabad with 2,488, Bahraich with 2,314 and Bareilly with 2,280. Of the 19 districts showing a decline Almora shows a falling off of 3,995, Rae Bareli of 3,574, Shahjahanpur of 2,370, Ballia of 2,049, Bijnor of 1,633, Gorakhpur of 1,573, Allahabad of 1,403, Agra of 1,239 and Jalaun of 1,204. In Almora the decrease is stated to have been due to the prevalence of skin diseases, diarrh( 3 ) during 1917-18 was 121,092, as compared with 119,088 in 1916-17. The total number of primary vaccinations in 1917-18 was 110,932 and that of re-vaccina- tions 11,866, against 108,845 and 11,669, respectively, in 1916-17. Successful primary vaccinations and successful re-vaccinations numbered in 1917-18, 105,751 and 7,006, respectively, as against 103,902 and 6,447, respectively, in 1916-17. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 38.60, against 37.67 in the preceding year. Among the municipalities showing a large number of persons successfully vaccinated per. 1,000 of population Jaunpur (as in the two preceding years) easily stands first with 122.87. Gonda comes next with 72.25, followed by Almora with 65.46, Naini Tal with 58.64, Bahraich with 56.42, Etah with 55.13 and Firozabad with 54.60. Naini Tal which was second last year stood fourth this year while Gonda which was third became second. The District Superintendent of Vaccination of Naini Tal attributes the comparative decrease in the degree of protection afforded to the fact that the last year's figure was abnormal on account of a small-pox scare. Among the least protected municipalities the most conspicuous are Mainpuri (15.91), Rae Bareli (18.12), Farrukhabad (20.29),Dehra Dun (25.77) and Nawabganj in the Bara Banki district (26.33). Dehra Dun and Nawabganj show a marked, and Farrukhabad a slight, improvement over last year, while Mainpuri and Rae Bareli show a decline. The decrease of work in the last two municipalities is attributed to the prevalence of plague throughout the vaccination season. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under the age of one year in the municipalities of these Provinces in 1917-18 was 85,127, vide Appendix B, against 82,237 in the preceding year( 4 ) number inspected by these officers during 1917-18 and 1916-17 was 257,858 (248,467 primary and 9,391 re-vaccinations) and 252,200 (245,076 primary and 7,124 re-vaccinations), respectively. These include 4,244 and 11,184 inspections of primary vaccinations and one and 8 those of re-vaccinations, respectively, performed in previous years and not included in Statement V. The percentages of inspections to the total number inspected during the two years were 15.67 and 15.24, respectively, as regards primary and 8 38 and 6.55, respectively, as regards re-vaccination. Among the districts showing a large number of inspections Bulandshahr, as last year, stands first with 15,419 ins- pections and is followed by Jaunpur with 13,323. Then in order come Pilibhit with 10,537, Basti with 9,314, Azamgarh with 9,274 and Sultanpur with 9,200. All these districts with the exception of Jaunpur and Azamgarh show an improve- ment over the preceding year( 5 ) The following table shows the annual output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the Dépôt: ( 6 ) 85.68 and 59.61, respectively, during the hot weather period (April to September 1917) and of 96.95 and. 73.43, respectively, during the cold weather period (October 1917 to March 1918), against 94.00, 57.28, 97.22 and 68.94, respectively, in 1916-17 as shown below:of population protected by [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] 918 and the six years preceding it.

[Prescribed maximum lengthNotes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1918-19. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) I continued to hold charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination throughout the year in addition to my own duties. Dr. D. D. Pandya remained in charge of the I and IV Ranges and in supervising charge of the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, throughout the year. Dr. A. Sousa held charge of the II Range throughout the year and of the III Range from the 1st April 1918, till the 7th February 1919. Major E. Bisset, I.M.S., who returned from Military duty on the afternoon of the 7th February 1919, held charge of the III Range from the 8th February 1919, till the close of the year. The number of assistant superintendents of vaccination remained the same (49) as in the previous year but the number of vaccinators increased from 915 in 1917-18 to 922 during the year under report. Expenditure on vaccination. (Statement II.) 2. The total cost of the Vaccination Department in 1918-19 amounted to Rs. 2,68,243 including the charges on account of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and their establish- ments, and to Rs. 2,34,870 excluding the latter charges( 2 ) the disease broke out in an epidemic form vaccination had to be temporarily stopped and vaccinators were supplied with medicines and employed on itinerating medical work. Besides, a considerable proportion of children was incapacitated for vaccination by the disease. In several districts there was a dislocation of work owing to the illness of a large number of vaccinators. Plague, cholera and relapsing fever were also responsible for the decrease in some cases. Re-vaccina- tion returns show an increase of 34,176 over the previous year's figures, but this is due to the fact that a large number of operations was performed owing to the outbreak of small-pox in many places. The importance of re-vaccination as a preventive against small-pox cannot be over-estimated. The district authorities should, therefore, take all possible steps to encourage this wholesome measure. The inconvenience resulting from re-vaccination is generally very slight and people can generally carry on their ordinary work without interruption after re-vaccination. Thus there is no excuse for avoiding re-vaccination. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator in 1918-19 was 1,535, against 1,833 in 1917-18 and the percentage of successful cases, in which the results were known, was 97.09 in the case of primary and 65.56 in the case of re-vaccination during the year under report, as compared with 97.40 and 72.50, respectively, in the preceding year. Successful primary vaccinations in different districts. (Statement I.) 5. There was a general decrease under this head throughout the Provinces during the year under report, as compared with the preceding year, except in the districts of Almora and Mirzapur which show an increase. Compared, however, with the provincial average (25,357) of successful primary vaccinations in different districts, 21 out of 48 districts show an increase. Of these Gorakhpur heads the list with an increase of 64,280, followed by Basti with an increase of 26,726, Meerut of 16,871, Jaunpur of 10,853, Bulandshahr of 8,353 and Moradabad of 7,694. The districts returning a low number of successful primary vaccinations are Dehra Dun (4,324), Naini Tal (6,516), Muttra (13,197), Jalaun (13,599) and Garhwal (14,001). Successful vaccination and degree of protection afforded. (Statement I.) 6. The number of persons successfully vaccinated by the district staff was 27. 84 per mille of population during 1918-19, against 33.95 in the preceding year. Almora heads the list of the well protected districts with a rate of 54.37, and is followed by Garhwal with a rate of 48.75, Jhansi of 40.53 and Mirzapur of 38.23. The most conspicuous of the least protected districts are Allahabad (17.51), Partabgarh (19.41), Mainpuri (20.64), Muttra (20.90) and Agra (21.11). Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 7. The percentages of successful vaccination in proportion to births show a decrease under all heads in 1918-19, as compared with the preceding year, the ratios for the two years being 43.75 and 48.69 in the case of children under one year, 18.47 and 19.06 in the case of children of one and under six years and 65.17 and 70.29 for all age periods, respectively. The decrease is attributed to high mortality among children. An examination of the figures of the different ranges shows that 53.06 children under one year of age were successfully vaccinated per 100 births during the year under report in the first range, 35.75 in the second range, 43.63 in the third range and 40.85 in the fourth range, against 61.92, 38 07, 48.73 and 42.86, respectively, in the preceding year. Mortality from small-pox. 8. The mortality registered from small-pox in 1918 was 2,908, equivalent to a death-rate of .06 per mille, against 2,011 and '04 in 1917, the mean ratio of the previous five years being .13. Diagram. 9. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the protection afforded by vaccination in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 10. During the year 1918-19, 933 vaccination operations (208 primary and 725 re-vaccination) were performed at the dispen- saries in these Provinces, against 143 in 1917-18, showing a marked increase of 790.
( 3 ) Vaccination in municipalities. 11. During 1918-19, 127,499 persons were vaccinated, against 121,092 in 1917-18. The vaccination operations performed in the two years numbered 128,751 (94,328 primary and 34,423 re-vaccination) and 122,798 (110,932 primary and 11,866 re-vaccination), respectively. The total number of successful cases amounted to 88,681 with a success percentage of 95.54 in the case of primary vaccination and to 17,586 with a percentage of 57.12 in the case of re-vaccination, during the year under report, as compared with 105,751 and 96.41 and 7,006 and 68.33, respectively, in the preced- ing year. The ratio of 36.38 represents the degree of protection afforded per mille of population in 1918-19, as compared with 38.60 in 1917-18. Among the well protected municipalities Ghaziabad with 134.91 heads the list, followed by Ghazipur with 105.07, Naini Tal with 97.78, Jaunpur with 89.63 and Hapur with 79.20. Jaunpur which occupied the top of the list last year changed its position to fourth this year and Naini Tal which was fourth stood third. The most conspicuous of the worst protected municipalities are Mainpuri (13.12), Bijnor (16.34), Farrukhabad-cum-Fatehgarh (19.58), Brindaban (19.95) and Dehra Dun (20.79). Mainpuri held the same position this year as it did last year (i. e. first), while Dehra Dun changed its position from the fourth to fifth. The successful vaccinations performed on children under one year of age in the municipalities in 1918-19 (which are shown in Appendix B) numbered 66,522 as against 85,127 in 1917-18. The cause of decrease is due to high mortality among infants, as explained elsewhere in the Notes. Vaccination in cantonments. 12. The number of vaccination operations performed and the number of persons vaccinated in the cantonments of these Provinces during the year under report were 54,883 (21,492 primary and 33,391 re-vaccination) and 54,869 against 27,064(13,105 primary and 13,959 re-vaccination) and 26,978, respectively, in the preceding year. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known amounted to 94.54 as regards primary and 57.61 as regards re-vaccination in 1918-19, compared with 94.68 and 69.08, respectively, in 1917-18, while the protection afforded per mille of population was 172.40, against 111.37. The figures show an improvement over the last year's under all the heads noted above except that under &quot;percentage of successful cases of re-vaccination&quot; in which there is a decrease and the head &quot; percentage of primary successful cases &quot; in which the ratios of the two years are practically the same. Vaccination in notified areas. 13. Colonelganj-cum-Sikrara (Gonda) and Moghal Sarai (Benares) were added to the list of notified areas during the year under report( 4 ) years not shown in Statement no. V) primary vaccinations, against 257,858 in the preceding year. The decrease is chiefly accounted for by the following facts:( 5 ) recovery from foot and mouth disease, which (as stated above) broke out amongst the calves at the beginning of the year. From the crude lymph, 104,190.0 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 1,168.4 grammes of glycerine paste were prepared, against 91,377.0 and 558.2 grammes, respectively, in the preceding year. There being no demand for it, no lanoline paste was prepared in 1918-19 as in the three preceding years. The annual output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccination and the income and expenditure of the Dépôt are shown in the sub-joined table :( 6 ) With the call lymph issued during the year 1918-19, 1,272,645 primary operations and 144,191 re-vaccinations were performed, against 1,564,611 and 100,413, respectively, in 1917-18, showing a decrease of 291,966 as regards primary operations and an increase of 43,778 as regards re-vaccinations. The returns of results received in 1918-19 show a success rate of 96.86 per cent. in 834,595 primary operations (excluding unknown cases), against 96.35 in 1917-18. In 95,581 re-vaccinations (excluding unknown cases), the results of which were received, the percentage of success was 66.19, against 70 35 in 1917-18. Appended is a table showing the results for 1917-18 and 1918-19:Diagram showing the relation between the death-rate from small-pox and the proportion of population protected by vaccination in each district of the United Provinces. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] The black lines and figures indicate proportion of population protected by vaccination during the year 1918-1919 and the six years preceding it.

[Prescribed maximum lengthErratum slip to the Triennial Report on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the years 1917-18, 1918-19 and 1919-20. Page. ForTriennial report on Vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1917-18, 1918-19 and 1919-20. Period covered by the report This report deals with vaccination during the triennium 1917-18 to 1919-20 but more especially with the work done in 1919-20, brief notes having been submitted on the work of the preceding two years. Area and population. 2. During the triennial period under review the town of Ramnagar com- prising an area of 4 square miles with a population of 14,017 souls, was under the Proclamation of the Govern- ment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, dated the 6th August, 1919, transferred from the Benares District to the Benares State( 2 ) 1917-18, respectively, the average annual expenditure in the two cases for the three years under report being Rs. 2,67,493 and Rs. 2,35,325 as against Rs. 2,44,339 and Rs. 2,13,032 in the previous triennial period, respectively. The increase in expenditure during the year under report as compared with the preceding two years is mainly due to (1) increased expenditure on the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt, Patwa Dangar, as explained in paragraph 19 of the report, and (2) the return of deputy sanitary commissioners belonging to the Indian Medical Service from military duty. Average cost of each successful case of vaccination. (Statement II ) 6. The average cost per successful operation amounted to annas two and pies eight during the year under report as compared with annas two and pics seven for the previous year and annas two for 1917-18. The average for the triennium under report was annas two and pies five as compared with annas two for the preceding triennium. The increase in cost is accounted for by the excess in the expenditure of the department as explained above. Besides this it is more apparent than real as the cost has been calculated on a comparatively smaller number of vaccinations performed during the triennium under report. In the table appended below, the cost per successful case of vaccination in these Provinces for the three years under review is compared with that of other Indian provinces :( 3 ) as compared with 97.00 and 65.53 for the last year and 97.40 and 72.50 for the year before last, respectively. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator in the three years under report was 1,533, 1,535 and 1,833, respectively, or an average of 1,634 against 1,805 for the preceding three years. It will be seen that there was a general decrease under the head &quot;primary vacci- nations&quot; performed during the triennium under report, as compared with that for the preceding triennial period but a marked increase under re-vaccinations. The decrease, as explained in paragraph 4 of the previous year's notes, was mainly due to the outbreak of influenza in an epidemic form in all the districts of these Pro- vinces in 1918-19 and its after-effects. A table showing the work done in the triennium under report as compared with the preceding triennium is appended below :( 4 ) Then came in order Naini Tal (36.30), Mirzapur (36.17), Pilibhit (34.76) and Saharanpur (33.91). The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated and the average annual death rate from small-pox per 1,000 of population during the five years previous to 1919-20 in these districts were 68.54, 64.09, 44.95, 34.73, 35.01, and 34.95 and .02, .07, .07, .52, .03 and .01, respectively. Of the worst protected districts, the most conspicuous are Partabgarh (20.52), Muttra (21.60), Allahabad (21.72) and Agra (21.94). The average annual number of persons successfully vaccinated and the average annual death rate from small-pox per mille of population during the previous five years in these four districts are Partabgarh (25.65 and .21), Muttra (32.95 and .02), Allahabad (26.49 and .53) and Agra (32.60 and .04). Of these districts Partabgarh was mentioned in the previous triennial report as amongst the districts showing the lowest number of protected persons per mille of population. However, all the above four districts show an improvement over last year's figures. Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 10. The percentage of successful vaccinations in proportion to births in 1919-20 shows the best results on record for the several years past, the ratios for the year being 53.59 in case of children under one year of age, 23.64 for children between the ages of one and under six years and 80.82 for all age periods as com- pared with 43.75, 18.47 and 65.17, respectively, in 1918-19 and 48.69, 19.06 and 70.29 in 1917-18. During the year under report 63.30 children under one year of age per hundred births were vaccinated in the I Range, 43.07 in the II Range, 55.46 in the III Range and 49.45 in the IV Range, as compared with 53.06, 35.75, 43.63 and 40.85, respectively, for last year and 61.92, 38.07, 48.73 and 42.86, respectively, for the year before last. The I Range has been showing a comparatively high percentage in this respect for the past several years. Mortality from small-pox. 11. In 1919, 10,993 deaths were recorded from small-pox, giving a death rate of .23 as compared with 2,908 and .06 in 1918, and 2,011 and .04 in 1917, respectively. The quin- quennial average was .11. Diagram. 12. A diagram showing the relation between the mortality from small-pox and the proportion of the population protected by vaccination in each district is attached. Dispensary vaccination. (Statement III.) 13. During the year under report the total number of vaccination opera- tions performed at the dispensaries in these Provinces amounted to 272 (120 primary and 152 re-vaccina- tions) as against 933 during last year and 143 during the year 1917-18, the average for the three years being 449 as compared with 276 for the preceding triennium. Vaccination in municipalities. 14. During the triennial period under review Kandhla municipality was converted into a notified area with effect from 15th August, 1917, and Kanauj notified area into a munici- pality from 1st September, 1919. The number of municipalities in 1919-20 stood at 84, but for the purposes of comparison of the statistics for the year under report, with those of the preceding two years, the figures of Kanauj have not been taken into account. The total number of persons vaccinated and the number of vaccination operations performed in the municipalities of these Provinces in 1919-20, were 119,765 and 121,739 (95,265 primary and 26,474 re-vaccinations) as compared with 127,499 persons and 128,751 operations in 1918-19 and 121,092 persons and 122,798 operations in 1917-18, respectively. The average for the three years comes to 122,785 in the case of the former and to 124,429 in the case of the latter as compared with 121,461 and 122,969, respectively, for the preceding corresponding period. Successful primary vaccina- tions and successful re-vaccinations performed during the year under report numbered 87,235 and 12,723 against 88,681 and 17,586 for the last year and 105,751 and 7,006 for the year before last, respectively, the averages for the present triennium being 93,889 and 12,438 as against 104,037 and 6,769 for the preceding triennium. The percentage of successful cases in which the results were known during 1919-20 was 93.21 in case of primary and 53.00 in case of re-vaccinations as compared with 95.54 and 57.12 in 1918-19 and 96.41 and 68.33 in 1917-18. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per mille of population during the three years was 34.06, 36.38 and 38.60 respectively.
( 5 ) Kashipur in Naini Tal District with 220.14 heads the list of the best protected municipalities. Naini Tal comes next with 180.69, followed by Ghazipur with 155.83, Almora with 69.59 and Mussoorie with 69.08. The municipalities of Naini Tal and Ghazipur which occupied the third and second position, respec- tively, on the list last year have interchanged their position this year. The munici- palities showing a lower degree of protection are Mainpuri (11.82), Rae Bareli (15.75), Fatehpur (18.77), Tanda in the Fyzabad District (19.40) and Fyzabad- Ajodhya (19.93). None of these has shown an improvement over last year. The decrease in Mainpuri is attributed to the diminished birth rate and in Rae Bareli chiefly to the carelessness of the vaccinator who has been severely punished. In the latter it is also partly due to the prevalence of influenza. In Fatehpur it is said to be due to the appointment of a new and inexperienced man. The epidemic of plague is given as the cause of decrease in the Tanda Municipality while the decrease in Fyzabad-Ajodhya is ascribed partly to influenza and partly to low birth rate. The number of vaccinations performed in the municipalities of the United Provinces on children under one year of age during the year under report will be found in Appendix B, attached to this report. Vaccination in cantonments. 15. The total number of persons vaccinated and the number of vaccination operations performed in the cantonments of these Provinces amounted to 17,575 and 17,602 (8,330 primary and 9,263 re-vaccinations), respectively, in 1919-20, as against 54,869 persons and 54,883 operations in 1918-19 and 26,978 persons and 27,064 operations in 1917-18. The number of successful primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations for the three years are 7,175 and 4,440, 15,431 and 17,702 and 12,220 and 9,184, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to a smaller number of operations performed among troops during the year under report. Vaccination in notified areas. 16. During the triennium under report Baghpat (Meerut) ceased to be a notified area from the 1st April, 1917. The Kandhla Municipality was converted into a notified area from the 15th August, 1917. Colonelganj-cum-Sikrara (Gonda) and Moghal Sarai (Benares) were constituted as notified areas from the 1st April and the 1st October, 1918, respectively. The notified area of Kanauj was raised to the status of a municipality from the 1st September, 1919. The number of notified areas in 1919-20 thus stood at 49. For the purposes of comparison of the year's statistics with those of the preceding two years, Kanauj has, however, been treated as a notified area. The statistics of Colonelganj-cum-Sikrara and Moghal Sarai were not available for the whole of the triennium under report. The figures in the former case were available only for the years 1918-19 and 1919-20, while in the latter case for the year 1919-20. The total number of (1) persons vaccinated, (2) vaccination operations, (3) successful primary operations, and (4) successful re-vaccinations performed in the 48 notified areas (excluding Moghal Sarai) in 1919-20, was 14,705, 14,910 (13,395 primary and 1,515 re-vaccinations), 12,566 and 928 as compared with 20,314. 20,437, 18,220 and 967 in 1918-19 and 17,964, 18,335, 14,223 and 1,948 (excluding Colonelganj-cum-Sikrara for which figures are not available) in 1917-18, respec- tively. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 39.73 in 1919-20 as compared with 55.04 and 47.08 in 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively. Of the well protected notified areas Mainpuri Civil Station stood first with a rate of 177.45 per mille followed by Shahganj (Jaunpur) with 171.62. Then came in order Ahraura (Mirzapur) with 96.14, Badshahpur (Jaunpur) with 89.74 and Madhoganj (Hardoi) with 67.95. Among the notified areas showing the least protection are Moghal Sarai in the Benares District (10.66), Bhowali in the Naini Tal District (13.07), Shikohabad in the Mainpuri District (16.16), Gorakhpur (18.46) and Ramnagar in the Naini Tal District (23.95). The statistics of Moghal Sarai for 1918-19 are not available. Out of the other four notified areas, the decrease in Shikohabad, as compared with last year, is negligible. No cause has been assigned by the District Superintendent of Vaccination for the decrease in the Gorakhpur Notified Area. In Bhowali the
( 6 ) decrease is stated to be due to influenza and in Ramnagar to influenza and cholera. Vaccination Act 17. The Vaccination Act is in force in all the cantonments, in 83 out of 84 municipalities and 47 out of 49 notified areas. Steps are being taken to extend the Act to the municipality of Kanauj (in the Farrukhabad District), recently converted as such and the notified areas of Mau and Mubarakpur in the Azamgarh District. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 18. (a) By Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and District Superintendents of Vaccination. The total number of vaccination opera- tions inspected by the deputy sanitary commissioners and the district superintendents of vaccination during 1919-20 was 180,569 (173,720 primary and 6,849 re-vaccinations), excluding 4,768 primary operations of the preceding year, as compared with 180,998 and 253,613 in 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively, the average for the present triennium being 205,060 as against 228,376 during the previous triennium. The decrease in the present triennium is, as explained in last year's report due to (1) the reversion of two deputy sanitary commissioners to military duty, (2) the number of vaccination operations performed being less, and (3) the prevalence of influenza in an epidemic form throughout these Provinces in 1918-19 and its after- effects. The districts showing a large number of vaccination inspections in 1919-20 are Azamgarh (18,185), Bulandshahr (14,107), Jaunpur (10,871) and Pilibhit (10,410). Among the districts showing a small number of inspections, the most conspicuous are Banda (471), Naini Tal (849), Kheri (1,135) and Allahabad (1,199). Of these Allahabad shows an increase over the past several years. The percentage of inspections to total number vaccinated was 13.60 in the case of primary and 5.18 in the case of re-vaccinations in 1919-20 as against 13.50 and 7.14 in 1918-19 and 15.67 and 8.38 in 1917-18, respectively. (b) By Assistant Superintendents of Vaccination.( 7 ) 25th July, 1917, when he reverted to military duty. I then took over charge of the Dépôt in my capacity of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, IV Range, and retained it till the 6th May, 1919. After that the charge of the Dépôt was assumed by Major C. L. Dunn, I.M.S., who held it till the 30th June, 1919, in addition to his own duties as Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, II Range, and till the close of the year 1919-20, in addition to his duties as Sanitary Commissioner, United Provinces. The services of Mr. D. F. MacArthur, the permanent Superintendent of the Dépôt having been temporarily placed at the disposal of the Military department, Mr. C. O. F. Lynn was temporarily appointed to the post. He held the appointment from 11th May, 1918, to 7th August, 1919, when he resigned. Captain E. H. Morbey, I.A.R.O., was then appointed as Superintendent of the Dépôt and he took over charge on the 20th September, 1919. During the triennium under report the second clerk of the Dépôt having proved himself totally inefficient for the post was removed from the service with effect from 25th March, 1919, and another man was appointed in his place. The pay of the Dépôt coolies was raised from Rs. 7 to Rs. 8 per mensem and that of the assistant gwala from Rs. 8 to Rs. 9 per mensem with effect from 1st November, 1918. The number of calves purchased or obtained on fees for vaccination in 1919-20 was 476 (124 cow and 352 buffalo), as against 450 in 1918-19 and 293 in 1917-18. Of the 476 calves 444 were successfully vaccinated, 22 failed, 5 died before operation and 5 remained unvaccinated at the close of the year. Out of the 66 deaths amongst the calves 41 occurred from Pleuro-pneumonia, 12 from Hæmorrhagic septicæmia, 8 from ordinary causes and 5 from general weakness. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained from 444 calves successfully vaccinated was 21,895.6 grammes, giving an average of 49.3 grammes per calf in 1919-20 as against 17,718.2 and 43.9 in 1918-19 and 15,341.7 and 57.0 in 1917-18, respectively. The high average in 1918-20 as compared with that of 1918-19 is due to the fact that much fewer cow calves and a much larger number of buffalo calves were vaccinated during this year as compared with the preceding year. From this crude lymph 124,248.5 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 2,646.2 grammes of glycerine paste were prepared in 1919-20, as against 104,190.0 and 1,168.4 grammes in 1918-19 and 91,377 and 558.2 grammes in 1917-18, res- pectively. No lanoline paste was manufactured. The table appended below shows the annual output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vacci- nation and the income and expenditure of the Depôt : ( 8 ) The quantity of glycerinated lymph issued in 1919-20 was 173,317 capillary tubes and 94,354.7 grammes in bulk in metal tubes as against 185,699 and 91,658 in 1918-19 and 172,462 and 86,658¾ in 1917-18, respectively. Of the total quan- tity of lymph issued 724 glass capillary tubes and 440 grammes in bulk costing Rs. 282 were issued free in 1919-20 as against 409 tubes and 94 grammes in bulk to the value of Rs. 67 in 1918-19 and 745 tubes and one gramme in bulk to the value of Rs. 28 in 1917-18. During the year under report all the 84 municipalities and 44 out of 49 notified areas were supplied with lymph on payment. The cost of lymph pur- chased by the 48 district boards was Rs. 20,560, by municipalities Rs. 5,080, by native . states and court of wards Rs. 2,917 and by notified areas and cantonments Rs. 1,272 in 1919-20, as against Rs. 19,953, Rs. 4,868, Rs. 2,158 and Rs. 1,414 in 1918-19, Rs. 19,787, Rs. 4 480, Rs. 2,306 and Rs. 1,505 in 1917-18, respectively. Lymph worth Rs. 2,965 was supplied to the Military department in 1919-20, as against Rs. 5,084 in 1918-19 and Rs. 2,462 in the year before, on an annual contract of Rs. 1,500. The contract money was originally fixed by the Government of India at Rs. 700 per annum, but the amount having been proved quite inadequate as compared with the cost of lymph supplied to the military medical officers, the Government of India were pleased to raise the amount to Rs. 1,500 per annum from the 1st April, 1917. It will, however, be seen from the figure3 given above that the Dépôt was put to a loss of Rs. 1,465, Rs. 3,584 and Rs. 962, respectively, during the three years mentioned above. The Local Government has, therefore, recently been approached with the request to move the Government of India to raise the amount to Rs. 3,000. The total receipts of the Dépôt during the year 1919-20 amounted to Rs. 35,430 (Rs. 32,354 from the sale of lymph and Rs. 3,076 from the sale of milk, calves, etc.), as compared with Rs. 32,836 and Rs. 32,681 in 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively. The expenditure of the Dépôt amounted to Rs. 31,547 during the year under report, as against Rs. 25,297 in the last year and Rs. 21,910 in the year before last. The increase is chiefly due to (1) the purchase of ammonia cylinders at a cost of Rs. 1,500, (2) the high prices of grains and oils, etc, (3) the appointment of an assistant mistri and (4) the payment of an allowance to the sub-assistant surgeon posted at Manora or at the Naini Tal Police Hospital for visiting the dépôt twice a week, as sanctioned by Government. The total number of vaccina- tion operations performed in 1919-20 with calf lymph was 1,424,069, (1,290,272 primary and 133,790 re-vaccinations) as compared with 1,416,836 and 1,665,024 in 1918-19 and 1917-18, respectively. The returns of results received show a percentage success of 82.65 in the case of primary vaccinations and 40.40 in the case of re-vaccinations for the period from April to September, 1919 (hot weather) and 96.37 and 68.41, respectively, for the period from October, 1919, to March, 1920 (cold weather), as compared with 90.40, 61.56, 97.20 and 67.71 in 1918-19 and 85.68, 59.61, 96.95 and 73.43 in 1917-18, respectively. The results of vaccination operations performed during the three years of the triennium under review are given in the subjoined table :( 9 ) Rs. 20-2-30 was obtained. Mr. Fleury, the Electrician at the Government House, inspects the plant, etc., twice monthly in summer and once a month in winter and is paid Rs. 15 per visit for this as remuneration. During the year 1919-20 the contract for the supply of calves to the Dépôt was held by one Kallan with no better results than in the case of the old contrac- tor. He failed to supply the required number of calves in time. A large number of calves supplied were weak with the result that a great many of them succumbed to pneumonia. It is proposed to obtain calves from the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment for the next season and it is hoped that this arrangement will prove satisfactory. The practice in the past of issuing lymph taken from calves during the month of September, which has in the past given bad results owing to high temperature, has now been discontinued and arrangements are being made to store a sufficient quantity of lymph manufactured during the cold season for issue during the hot weather and the first six weeks of the ensuing vaccination season. During the year under report Relapsing fever broke out on two occasions among the coolies at the Dépôt and eight of them died of the disease. Arrange- ments were made for the segregation and treatment of the patients. With the sanction of Government, arrangements have now been made for the sub-assistant surgeon, Police Hospital, Naini Tal, to visit the Dépôt twice a week during the cold weather and the sub-assistant surgeon, Manora Infections Hospital, during the hot weather. Combined birth and vaccina- tion registers. 20. During the triennial period under review a circular was issued by this office to all district superintendents of vaccination with a view to ensure efficiency and uniformity in the preparation and maintenance of combined birth and vaccination registers, as there existed a diversity of practice in various districts. Printed rubkars and parwanas. 21. In 1913-14 a system of issuing printed rubkars and parwanas in vernacular to leading official and non-official gentle- men asking for their assistance in vaccination work was introduced in the district of Kheri. Government having approved of the system commended the same to the notice of district officers in all the districts of these Provinces. The lists of unvaccinated children were, however, ordered to be prepared every third year instead of every year. District annual vaccination returns. 22. A circular letter is sent out every year to all the district superintendents of vaccination asking them to submit vaccination returns and reports, correct and complete, on the prescribed date. In spite of this some of the district returns were received very late and had to be returned for corrections more than once. NAINI TAL : D. D. PANDYA, D.P.H. (CAMB.), ETC. Offg.

Paragraph 14.] ( 5A ) APPENDIX B.( 6A ) APPENDIX B.ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT. No. 324C/XVI-47. SANITATION DEPARTEMENT RESOLUTION. Dated Naini Tal, the 6th July, 1920. Read. The triennial report on vaccination in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh for the years 1917- 18, 1916-19, and 1919-20. OBSERVATIONS:( 2 ) which is another district on which unfavourable comment was made in the reviews of 1914 and 1917, the ratio of successfully-vaccinated persons has increased from 23.07 in 1916-17 to 30.15 in 1919-20, while the small-pox death rate for the previous five years has fallen from .25 to .22. 3. The percentage of vaccinations in proportion to births was generally satisfactory in 1919-20, but fewer children under one year of age were vaccinated in the municipalities. In 1916-17, 82,572 such children were vaccinated in municipalities, but in 1919-20 the figure fell to 69,493, although municipalties recorded 119,952 births in that year. The proportion of unvaccinated children under one year of age is high. For instance, in the important municipality of Benares though there were 8,247 births in 1919-20, only 3,860 children under one year of age were successfully vaccinated in that year. There is undoubtedly room for greater attention to vaccination in municipalities. The same remark applies also to cantonments and notified areas in which the Act is in force. Vaccination operations in both kinds of locality were less numerous at the close than at the beginning of the triennium. 4. Inspections of vaccination operations decreased, but this is explained by the decrease in the number of operations performed. The work turned out by vaccinators similarly decreased. In the previous triennium each vaccinator performed annually on an average 1,805 vaccinations, but in the present triennium the average sank to 1,634. 5. The average annual expenditure on vaccination rose, as compared with the previous trienniuim, from Rs. 2,44,339 to Rs. 2,67,493. The rise is due to increased expenditure on the Government Lymph Dépôt at Patwa Dangar and also to the return from military duty of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners belonging to the Indian Medical Service. The average cost of a successful vaccination operation in this province still compares favourably with that in other provinces. 6. The record of work of the Patwa Dangar Lymph Dépôt is satisfactory, and arm-to-arm vaccination has to an increising extent been replaced by calf- lymph vaccination. 7. The work of vaccination has been hampered during the period under review by causes already discussed. Better progress may be expected in the future. The thanks of Government are due to the officers who held the office of Superintendent-General of Vaccination during the triennium and to Dr. Pandya for an interesting report.

[Prescribed maximum lengthErratum slip to the Notes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for 1920-21. Page. ForNotes on Vaccination in the United Provinces for the year 1920-21. Brief notes on vaccination in 1920-21. As a detailed report for the triennium 1917-18 to 1919-20 was submitted last year, this report deals briefly with vaccination in 1920-21 as compared with 1919-20. Constitution and strength of the department. (Statement II.) 2. I held charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination from the 1st to the 28th of April, 1920, when I pro- ceeded to England on privilege leave after making over charge to Dr. D. D. Pandya, Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, IV Range. I returned from leave and resumed charge from Dr. Pandya on the 19th November and remained in charge till the close of the year. Dr. D. D. Pandya held charge of the IV Range from 1st to 28th April, 1920 and again from 19th November, 1920 till the end of the year. He was also in collateral charge of the II Range from 1st to 28th April, 1920 and from 25th February to 31st March, 1921. Dr. A Sousa remained in charge of the 1st Range throughout the year, with the additional charge of the 3rd Range from 1st April to 18th November, 1920. Captain K. C. Dube was in collateral charge of the II and IV Ranges, from 29th April to 7th November, 1920, when he made over charge of the II Range to Major W. A. Mearns, I.M S., but continued to hold charge of the IV Range up to 18th November. From the 19th November, 1920 to the end of the year he was in charge of the III Range. Major W. A. Mearns, I.M.S., was Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, 2nd Range, from 8th November, 1920 to 24th February, 1921, when he proceeded on leave. The number of assistant superintendents of vaccination (49) remained unaltered, but that of vaccinators decreased from 923 in 1919-20 to 920 during the year under report. With the approval of Government, I circularized all district boards, suggesting an increase in the pay of the vaccination staff on the basis of the scale laid down in G. O. no. 2418/X-389, dated the 17th June, 1920. Copies of this circular were also sent to all the local bodies concerned. From the information available it however appears that although a number of district and municipal boards, etc., have treated their vaccination staff liberally in this respect, either no increase at all or very inadequate increases have been given by others. The advisability of increasing the pay of the vaccination staff, which is very discontented, cannot be too strongly commended to the notice of the local bodies concerned. Expenditure on vaccination (Statement II.) 3. There was an increase of Rs. 60,671 in the total expenditure in 1920-21, including the charges on account of the Deputy Sani- tary Commissioners and their establishments as com- pared with 1919-20 and of Rs. 51,492 excluding these charges( 2 ) The following table shows the average cost of each successful case of vacci- nation in these provinces during the year under report as compared with other provinces:( 3 ) a ratio of 57.52 and was followed by Almora with 53.48. Then in order came Benares with 33.46, Mirzapur with 33.39, Cawnpore with 33.04 and Buland- shahr with 32.54. Among the least protected districts the most conspicuous were Rae Bareli (18.95), Allahabad (20.03), Fyzabad (20.79), Lucknow (20.86) and Fatehpur (20.99). Vaccination in proportion to births and according to age. 8. The percentages of successful vaccinations in proportion to births during 1920-21 were 51.22 for children under one year of age, 18.59 for those between the ages of one and under six years, and 72.55 for all age-periods against 53.59, 23.64 and 80.82, respectively, in 1919-20. It will be seen that there was a decline under each head as compared with the preceding year. The number of children under one year of age successfully vaccinated in 1920-21 per hundred births was 59.72 for the 1st Range, 40.48 for the 2nd Range, 56.95 for the 3rd Range and 47.55 for the 4th Range as compared with 63.30, 43.07, 65.46 and 49.45, respectively, in 1919-20. The fall is due to the facts explained in paragraphs 5 and 6. The 1st Range however maintains its reputation of affording best protection as compared with. other ranges. Mortality from small-pox. 9. The death-rate from small-pox in 1920 amounted to .13 per mille of the population as compared with .23 in 1919 and .08( 4 ) in 1920-21 against 60.44 in 1919-20. The decrease is mainly due to a smaller number of operations having been performed among recruits and to the absence of troops. Vaccination in notified areas. 14. As stated in paragraph 12 above, the notified area of Kanauj, which was converted into a municipality from 1st September, 1919: but was treated as a notified area for the purposes of figures shown in that year's report, has been excluded from the statement of notified areas for this year. Its statistics have also been excluded from the preceding year's returns for the purposes of comparison. The statistics for Moghal Sarai being available for 1919-20 and 1920-21, have been taken into account. Pauri in the Garhwal District was constituted a notified area from 1st April, 1920, but as its statistics for the year 1919-20 are not available, it has not been treated as such for the purposes of comparison. Thus the number of notified areas though actually 50, has been taken at 49. The total number of persons vaccinated and the number of vaccination operations performed in the notified areas during 1920-21 were 13,399 and 13,590 (12,477 primary and 1,113 re-vaccination), respectively, as compared with 14,181 and 14,369 (12,864 primary and 1,505 re-vaccination), respectively, in the preceding year. The number of successful primary cases was 11,897 and that of successful re-vaccinations 675 against 12,089 and 926, respectively, in 1919-20. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of population was 37.72 against 40.13 in 1919-20. Of the well-protected notified areas, Mainpuri Civil Station stood first with a rate of 203'47 per mille, followed by Shahganj (Jaunpur), with 174 42. Then came in order Ahraura (Mirzapur) with 95.91, Badshahpur (Jaunpur) with 91.63 and Mawana (Meerut) with 66.84 The first four notified areas mentioned above retained their position of the last year. Among the notified areas showing the least protection are Chunar Settlement in the Mirzapur District (2.90), Bhowali in the Naini Tal District (11.76), Rajpur in the Dehra Dun District (13.64), Moghal Sarai in the Benares District (15.28), and Bargain Bazar in the Gonda District (15.38). Moghal Sarai and Chunar Settlement show an improvement over last year, while others a decrease. The decrease in Bhowali is attributed by the District Superintendent of Vaccination to the preva- lence of influenza. In Bargain Bazar it is stated to be due to the slackness of a vaccinator who has been punished. In Rajpur no cause has been assigned for the decrease. Vaccination Act. 15. The Vaccination Act is in force in all the cantonments and notified areas and in 83 out of 84 municipalities. Steps are being taken to extend the Act to the Kanauj munici- pality in the Farrukhabad District. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 16.

Bulandshahr, Jaunpur and Pilibhit, which were second, third and fourth on the list last year, stood first, second and third, respectively, this year, but with a smaller number of inspections. Of the districts in which the smallest number of inspections was performed, the most conspicuous were Garhwal (645), Naini Tal (693), Banda (777) and Shahjahanpur (1,172). Of these, only Banda showed an improvement over last year. (b) By assistant superintendents of vaccination and other inspecting officers. ( 6 ) grammes in the preceding year.

Area and population According to Census of 1921 the area of the Province excluding the Native States of Rampur, Benares, and Tehri-Garhwal was 107,167 square miles and the population 45,375,787 souls. Constitution and strength of the department. 2 The charge of the office of the Superintendent-General of Vaccination was held by Lieutenant-Colonel C. L. Dunn, D.P.H , I.M.S., throughout the year. The following officers were in charge of the several ranges during the year under report :( 2 ) and Rs. 4,02,165 and Rs. 3,03,360, respectively. The increase in expenditure during the year under report was mainly due to the following facts : ( 3 ) Gorakhpur (12,939), Azamgarh (11,973), Ghazipur (8,512), Basti (7,058), Farrukh- abad (5,703), Moradabad (5,343), and Sitapur (5,303). The non-co-operation movement is reported to be a common cause of decrease in vac ination work in all the seven districts. The additional causes in some districts were ( 4 ) primary and 15,641 re-vaccination), respectively. The total number of successful cases amounted to 82,881 in the case of primary vaccination and to 5,664 in that of re-vaccination during the year under review, as compared with 86,987 and 7,895, respectively, in 1920-21. The ratio of 30.39 represents the degree of protection afforded per mille of population in 1921-22 as compared with 32.12, in 1920-21. Among the well protected municipalities Naini Tal with 69.57 persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population heads the list, and is followed by Gonda with 60.63, Etah with 56.58, Unao with 50.06, Bahraich with 48.92 and Orai with 48.56. Almora, which headed the list last year with 230.86, stands 48th with 30.49. In Almora a very large number of re-vaccinations was performed in 1920-21. Naini Tal, which stood fifth last year, is first this year. Gonda which was fourth in 1920-21 is second this year while Etah retains its position of last year as third. Among the least protected municipalities the most conspicuous are Mainpuri (8.08), Ujhani (13.81), Rae Bareli (15.26), Farrukhabad (19.41), and Tanda in the Fyzabad district (19.55). The decrease in Mainpuri is due to a certain extent to the heavier mortality among infants and in Ujhani to notices not having been served on parents who failed to bring their children for vaccination. In Rae Bareli it is ascribed to the fact that many children left the town while many could not be traced as the vaccinator was new. In Farrukhabad the Medical Officer of Health attributes it partly to the non-co-operation movement and partly to the replacement of two old vaccinators by only one new hand, the second post being abolished. In Tanda no cause has been assigned by the District Superintendent of Vaccination. The number of successful vaccinations performed on children under the age of one year in the municipalities in 1921-22 was 66,494 (vide appendix B) against 70,086 in 1920-21. Vaccination in cantonments. 13. The number of vaccination operations performed and the number of persons vaccinated in the cantonments of these Prov- inces during the year under report were 8,775 (5,178 primary and 3,597 re-vaccination) and 8,764 against 11,527 (6,015 primary and 5,512 re-vaccination) and 11,516, respectively, in the preceding year. The number of successful primary vaccinations and successful re-vaccinations during the two years were 4,686 and 2,212 and 5,713 and 3,579, respectively. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 33.46 in 1921-22 against 48 35 in 1920-21. The decrease may chiefly be ascribed to a smaller number of operations having been performed among the recruits. Among the best protected cantonments, Almora stands first with 267.58. Then in order come Naini Tal with 124.10, Fyzabad with 121.64, Cawnpore with 105.19 and Chakrata with 102.81. Vaccination in notified areas 14. As stated in paragraph 12 above, the notified area of Baraut was con- verted into a municipality from the 1st April, 1921. Pauri (Garhwal), which had been constituted a noti- fied area in 1920, was abolished from the 1st April, 1921. Rajpur (Dehra Dun) was also abolished from 23rd August, 1921. The population of the notified area of Chunar settlement according to the Census of 1921 having been included into that of the Chunar notified area by the Census authorities and not being available separately, the two notified areas have been treated as one for statistical purposes. Thus the number of notified areas fell from 50 in the preceding year to 46 during the year under report. The number of persons vaccinated and that of operations performed in the 46 notified areas in 1921-22 were 10,792 and 10,940, respectively, against 13,399 and 13,590, respectively, in 1920-21. Of the 10,940 operations per- formed 10,407 were primary and 533 re-vaccination as compare with 12,477 and 1,113 in the preceding year respectively. The total number of successful primary vaccinations amounted to 9,944 and successful re-vaccination to 369 in 1921-22 against 11.897 and 675, respectively, in the previous year. The number of persons successfully vaccinated per 1,000 of the population was 31.59 against 37.72 Of the well protected notified areas Mainpuri civil station, like last year, stands first with a ratio of 104.83, followed by Bhim Tal Sat Tal with 56.14. Then in order come Chunar with 50.14. Mawana with 42.45, Rath with 41.19, Rasra with 41.05, and Kosi with 40.72. Among the notified areas showing the least protection, the most conspicuous are Shahganj in the Jaunpur district (13 50), Bhowali and Ramnagar in the Naini Tal district with 16 76 and 16.83, respectively, followed by Bargain Bazar in the Gonda district (17.04), Mau in the Azamgarh district (17.11), Kaimganj in the Farrukhabad district (17.18), and
( 5 ) Haldwani in the Naini Tal district (17.33). Bhowali, Kaimganj, and Bargain Bazar show some improvement over last year, while Shahganj practically maintains the same position. The decrease in Ramnagar is due to the fact that there being no small-pox a lesser number of re-vaccinations was performed. In Mau it is ascribed to non-co-operation movement while in Haldwani to the decrease of population in the Tarai and Bhabar. Vaccination Act. 16. The Vaccination Act is in force in all the municipalities (except Baraut, lately converted into a municipality) notified areas, and cantonments. The municipality of Ghazipur passed a resolution recommending the with- drawal of the operation of the Act from that municipality but it was rejected by Government. General results of inspection. (Statement V.) 16. (a) By Assistant Directors of Public Health and District Superintend- ents of Vaccination. The total number of vacci- nations inspected by the Assistant Directors of Pub- lic Health and District Superintendents of Vaccination during the year 1921-22 (excluding 654 of previous years not shown in statement no. V) amounted to 155,195 (153,952 primary and 1,243 re-vaccination) as compared with 147,022 (142,518 primary and 4,504 re-vaccination) in 1920-21( 6 ) Dépôt can still be carried out at a profit, while the price of 80 per cent, of the lymph sold is still at pre-war prices. I therefore wish to bring his services specially to the notice of Government for some tangible recognition. The clerical and vaccination establishments carried out their duties satisfactorily. On the whole the services of M. Yaqub Ali, the 1st laboratory assistant, are specially worthy of mention. &quot; No difficulty was experienced in obtaining labour. The contract for the supply of calves was given to one Abdul Rahim of Bareilly at Rs. 13 for each calf, i.e., Rs. 2 per calf less than last year, and Rs. 4 were paid by him for each animal returned. Although the calves supplied were on the whole in a poor condition, no difficulty was experienced in obtaining the requisite number. The number of calves purchased during the year under report was 469 (121 cow and 348 buffalo) as against 504 (107 cow and 397 buffalo) in 1920-21. Of the 469 calves, 451 were successfully vaccinated, 10 failed (out of which one died), and eight died before vaccination. There was again an epidemic of rinderpest early in the vaccination season in spite of all the animals having been inoculated with anti-rinderpest serum. There was also an epidemic of pleuro-pneumonia due undoubtedly to a very cold winter and badly ventilated calf-sheds. The death roll was very heavy, altogether 178 animals having died, 23 of rinderpest, 143 of pleuro-pneumonia, and 12 of ordi- nary diseases. The total quantity of crude lymph obtained during the year under report was 22,047.9 grammes from 451 successful calves, giving an average of 48'9 against 21,407.8 grammes from 461 calves and an average of 46.4 in 1920-21. The average yield of crude lymph per cow and buffalo calf in 1921-22 was 26.1 and 57.05 grammes, respectively, against 28.5 and 51.6, in 1920-21. From this crude lymph 143,608.8 grammes of glycerinated lymph and 1,619 grammes of glycerine paste were manufactured during the year against 127,099.6 grammes of glycerinated lymph, 1,970.6 grammes glycerine paste and 4 grammes lanoline paste in the preceding year. Appended is a table giving the annual output of lymph, the number of areas in which arm-to-arm vaccination has been replaced by calf lymph vaccina- tion, and the income and expenditure of the Dépôt:( 7 ) Of the total quantity of lymph issued 660 capillary tubes and 75 grammes in bulk to the value of Rs. 91 were issued free during the year under report against 1,443 capillary tubes and 126 grammes in bulk to the value of Rs. 131 in 1920-21. All the 85 municipalities and 47 notified areas (with the exception of six notified areas, viz., Aonla, Auraiya, Mughalserai, Chunar Settlement, Badshahpur and Madhoganj) were supplied with lymph on payment. Lymph worth Rs. 19,578 was purchased by district boards, worth Rs. 6,308, by municipalities worth Rs. 4,781, by Indian States, worth Rs. 1,129 by private persons, worth Rs. 991 by notified areas and worth Rs. 619 by cantonments. There has been a decrease in the demand for lymph from the military authorities, lymph to the value of Rs. 1,536 having been supplied in 1921-22 against Rs. 2,064 in 1920-21 on an annual contract grant of Rs. 3,000. The total sale-proceeds of lymph from the Dépôt in 1921-22 amounted to Rs. 36,406 and that of miscellaneous articles to Rs. 2,763 (or a total of Rs. 39,169) against Rs. 33,025 and Rs. 4,119, respectively (or a total of Rs. 37,144) in the preceding year. Owing to a considerable increase in the cost of glass capillary tubes and calves, an increase was (with the approval of Government) made in the price of lymph issued in capillary tubes in order that the Government Bovine Lymph Dépôt may not run at a loss. The total expenditure incurred during the year under report was Rs. 33,259 as against Rs. 39,217 in 1920-21. As the total receipts were Rs. 39,169 and expenditure Rs. 33,259, a credit balance of Rs. 5,910 has been shown, not taking into consideration the amount of lymph manufactured for next year which has an estimated minimum value of Rs. 25,496. These very satisfactory results are due to the following reasons :( 8 ) number of vaccinations have been carried out this year than in any other year since 1914 :pulation protected by [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page] the six years preceding it.
