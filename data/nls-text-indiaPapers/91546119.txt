A.RESOLUTION ON NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1899-1900.

READ2 RESOLUTION ON NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. of the returns for this district. The Superintendent-General is requested to insist upon a careful verification of the figures. Generally speaking, there appears to have been some advance in the degree of protection afforded, but until greater accuracy is secured in the returns, it is unsafe to attempt to form conclusions. Comparative results by districts. 4. The average number of persons vaccinated by each vaccinator varied from 1,024 in Myitkyina to 5,109 in Sandoway. The figures for the latter district have been shown to be unreliable. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations is highest in Minbu (98.76), and Rangoon (98.64), and lowest in the Shan States (62.30 and 74.90), and in Myitkyina (77.83). Sir Frederic Fryer agrees with the Superintend- ent-General that the percentages of successful re-vaccinations which range from 7.33 in Sandoway to 100 in Thatôn and Salween must be accepted with caution. With the exception of the Shan States, Akyab shows the smallest number of per- sons successfully vaccinated per mille of population. The unfavourable comments which have been made annually on the state of vaccination in this district and in Myaungmya do not appear to have had much effect: in the latter district the work performed by the vaccinators is again small, and the number of persons pro- tected during the year is well below the average. Dispensary vaccinations. 5. The number of primary operations decreased from 8,209 to 6,033, and the number of re-vaccinations rose from 6,140 to 6,594. The percentage of successful primary vaccinations was considerably lower than the average for the whole province: in Mogaung it was as low as 44.71. The percentage of successful re-vaccinations, on the other hand, was abnormally high. In Magwe 384 persons are reported to have been re-vaccinated, and all successfully, while in Sandoway only four cases were suc- cessful out of 147. These figures do not inspire confidence. Vaccination in the Shan States. 6. The total number of persons vaccinated in the Shan States has risen from 6,725 to 8,262; the number of vaccinators has in- creased from 5 to 6 and their average number of ope- rations has slightly increased. The results, however, are not so satisfactory, the percentage of successful operations having fallen from 84.89 to 68.93. No re- vaccinations were performed. Inspection revealed that many of the returns sent in by the vaccinators were falsified. Vaccination in Rangoon. 7. The number of primary vaccinations in the Rangoon Municipality has again decreased from 5,516 to 2,457, while re-vacci- nations have fallen from 4,938 to 2,899. The average number of operations performed by each vaccinator was only 1,309; in the previous year it was 2,366. Out of a total of 3,164 births registered, only 1,119 children under one year of age were successfully vaccinated. These figures are so unsatis- factory as to justify the presumption that the Health Officer of the Municipality has neglected this most important part of his duties. The President is requested to look into the matter. Verification of results. 8. A most unsatisfactory feature of the report is the decrease again this year in the number of cases verified by native Superin- tendents. The same defect was commented on in last year's Resolution, but no improvement has resulted. Apart from this, however, it
RESOLUTION ON NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 3 seems clear that more native Superintendents are required. In Lower Burma there. are 11 and in Upper Burma only three. One man cannot successfully supervise the staff of vaccinators for two or more districts, with the result that many operators escape almost wholly from inspection. The consequences are obvious. In Sando- way and Tavoy, for example, which claim to have successfully vaccinated a larger number of persons per 1,000 than any other district, the total number of cases veri- fied by native Superintendents was 88 and 1,198 respectively, or .56 and 4.85 respec- tively of the total number of vaccinations performed. In Amherst the native Super- intendents inspected 11,568 cases; in Myaungmya, which has long been unfavour- ably known for its backwardness in vaccination, the total of cases inspected amounted to 214. The system is partly to blame, but there is no reason why the existing staff should perform less work each year. The Superintendent-General should consider whether it is not advisable to increase the staff. From the number of false returns submitted by vaccinators, as well as the amount of incompetent vaccination reported to have been detected by Civil Surgeons' inspections, it is clear that a much more effective supervision is necessary. Laxness in supervi- sion not only encourages bad work but gives opportunities to the vaccinators to falsify statistics to such an extent that it is practically impossible to come to any reliable conclusion regarding the progress of vaccination in this province. The inspection work of Civil Surgeons has been more thoroughly carried out than in the previous year. In the majority of cases the percentage of successful cases discovered by their inspections was smaller than the number discovered by the native Superintendents, from which it would appear that the latter are not absolutely reliable in their figures. For example, the percentages of successes discovered by the Civil Surgeon and the native Superintendent in Hanthawaddy are 59.01 and 92.11 respectively. Financial. 9. There has been an increase in the total cost of the department of Rs. 4,008-3-0 as compared with the previous year The appointment of two more native Superintendents and nine more vaccinators is chiefly responsible for this. Rather more than half the expenditure was borne by Local Funds ; the balance Government and Munici- palities contributed in about the same ratio as in the preceding year, the figures being 22.31 and 25.52 respectively. The average cost of each successful case in the districts outside of Municipal towns varied from one anna in Sandoway and Tavoy to seven annas and one pie in Myitkyina and eight annas and nine pies in the Southern Shan States. In the majority of cases there was a slight decrease in cost. Statistics regarding the cost of vaccination in Municipal towns are given on page 6 of the report. The cost of each successful case varies from Rs. 1 -1-4 in Rangoon to Re. 0-1-2 in Myanaung. General remarks. 10. During the year under review the Burma Vaccination Law Amendment Act was passed. This Act, which is the outcome of a long discussion, gives power to Superintendents of Vaccination in Rangoon Municipality, and in other Municipalities to which the Act may be extended, to require an unprotected person to be vaccinated, and provides moreover for the compulsory vaccination of inmates of lodging-houses or coolie- barracks. It is hoped that the provisions of the new Act will result in checking to

Sir Frederic Fryer has read with interest Captain Williams' account of the year's work at the Taunggyi Vaccination Depôt. There seem to be consider- able disadvantages about this locality. The Superintendent-General's proposals for moving the depôt are awaited. It would be interesting to learn to what extent the progress of vaccination varies in different districts with the prevalence of the custom of inoculation. Colonel Little's interesting report is necessarily marred by the unreliability of the statistics furnished. Not only has the population increased greatly since the last census, upon the figures of which the calculations in these reports have to be based, but the unaccountable variations in the returns from different districts give ground for thinking that many vaccinators, where supervision is lax, falsify the statistics so as to make their work appear greater and more successful than it is. District Superintendents should be specially requested to apply more search- ing tests to the returns of their subordinates. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, R. E. V. ARBUTHNOT, Officiating Secretary.
NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA For the year 1899-1900. IN accordance with instructions contained in Government of India Home Department letter No. 28-15792 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. Commissioner remarked that &quot; it is desired that vaccinators should as far as &quot; possible confine their energies to primary operations until they have overtaken &quot; the annual increase of population by births, and this goal is far ahead except in &quot; large towns.&quot; This remark is as applicable today as it was four years ago. Vaccinators will be required to give more particular attention to primary vaccina- tion for the present. By efficient vaccination in infancy most people are completely insured for their whole lifetime against an attack of small-pox, and, in the proportionately few cases where the protection is less complete, small-pox, if it be caught, will, in consequence of the vaccination, be so mild a disease as not to cause death nor disfigurement. Such being the almost perfect security which well-performed in- fantile vaccination confers against death from small-pox, it is therefore a matter of the utmost importance that infantile vaccination should be first of all strictly enforced and the most scrupulous care taken as to the complete and perfect per- formance of the operation. In a certain proportion-of the cases, on account of unskilful or bad vaccination, partial protection only results, but this remnant of danger is not great, and, if the annual births are but steadily and efficiently vaccinated, the still considerable small-pox mortality of this province will soon be reduced to a small fraction.

This possibly may in a measure be accounted for by improved registration, small-pox deaths being now more accurately reported than when registration was first introduced. The last 20 years, taken in quinquennial periods, give the following results:[NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 5 From this diagram it will be seen that about one-third of the population of Burma is protected against small-pox by vaccination, and though the diagram shows that generally small-pox mortality is low in the best vaccinated districts, yet districts with very similar protection show very variable death-rates. In Sandoway district more than the total population is shown to have been protected in the last seven years, yet the death-rate from small-pox is four per 10,000 as compared with .4 for Mergui, where about half the population are shown as protect- ed. Mergui and Amherst reach the same measure of protection, 4,800 per 10,000, but the ratio of deaths from small-pox was 4 for Mergui and 12 for Amherst. Rangoon, which comes third highest as regards protection, 6,200 per 10,000, returns far away the highest mortality from small-pox, 51.0. No conclu- sion can therefore be deduced from this diagram beyond the fact above stated that small-pox mortality is low in the best vaccinated districts. Vaccination in municipalities. 4.

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 7 During the triennium referred to in the table there has been a steady decline in the total amount of work done as well as in the number of primary successful operations in ten of the 41 towns named. The explanations offered in the majo- rity of cases are unsatisfactory. At Myanaung, Mergui, Kyaikto, Shwebo, Sagaing, Pyinmana, and Myingyan the usual excuse, a paucity of subjects, is pleaded. The percentage of success obtained in primary vaccination is, however, better than in the preceding years at most of these stations. The reduction at Mônywa is due to the work done by municipal vaccinators outside town limits being included in the figures for the district in accordance with orders on the sub- ject. The Ramree Municipality ceased to exist after the 31st August 1899 and the work done after that done in the town has been included in the district re- turns. At Akyab the number vaccinated has declined and the number of success- ful primary vaccinations has fallen to nearly equal the number protected in 1897- 98, while the percentage of success is less than in the two previous years, when it was 97.62 and 100.00 respectively, having been reduced to 95.98. At Pegu. Ma-ubin, Moulmein, Thatôn, Toungoo, Taungdwingyi, and Kyauksè the total number vaccinated after showing an improvement in 1898-99, has fallen below the number returned for 1897-98. Of the six stations just named, Moulmein alone shows an improvement in the percentage of successful primary cases over that of the preceding two years. The falling off at Rangoon is dealt with in paragraph 4(b). The work done in the Yandoon, Ngathainggyaung, Zalun, Bhamo, and Salin Municipalities has improved steadily in quantity and quality. While the quantity of work done in Prome, Minbu, and Pagan has increased, the percentage of suc- cess secured in primary vaccinations shows a falling off. At Letpadan and Thônzè likewise there is an increase in numbers vaccinated, but the amount of protection secured has declined slightly. In the towns of Bassein and Yamèthin the number and percentage of successful primary vaccinations show improve- ment. The ratios of success returned by Shwegyin, Mandalay, Bhamo, and Shwebo are suspiciously high. Town. Average number.

The cost per head is excessive at Akyab, Kyaukpyu, Pegu, and Paungdè. The vac- cinators employed by the municipalities named in the margin claim the largest average number of operations.

This excess of in- fants protected over the number available can only be said to be due to defective registration or inaccurate vaccination returns. Civil Surgeons in most instances say the excess is caused by children being brought from elsewhere into the town for vaccination, but this explanation could scarcely account for the extremes in the towns of Ma-ubin, Moulmein, and Bassein. In some of the smaller munici- palities, it is possible that, as the vaccinator works in villages in the immediate vicinity of the town, the figures for those villages have been included in the municipal return, notwithstanding orders to the contrary. The matter, however, requires elucidation and will be enquired into.

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 11 (a) Vaccination and registered births outside towns.12 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. Of the total cost a percentage of 51.65 was borne by Local funds, 25.51 by Municpal funds, 22.31 by Government, and .53 by Native States. The average cost of each successful vaccination was the same as in 1898-99NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 13 in the Thatôn district exaggerated his work. Three of the Shwebo district vacci- nators were found guilty of returning as successful operations which were not successful, besides otherwise falsifying their returns. The Municipal vaccinator at Kyauksè exaggerated his work by entering fictitious names in his registers. A vaccinator in the Myingyan district returned as successful cases which he had not verified. In the Northern Shan States a vaccinator was found to have falsi- fied his returns : out of 184 cases reported successful only 28 were found on inspec- tion to be protected Three vaccinators in the Southern Shan States returned cases as successful which were found on inspection to be failures. Thus in 13 out of 38 districts the statistics were found to have been falsified. In the majority of instances cited above the vaccinators were punished with dismis- sal or removal from the service. Prosecutions were instituted in some cases and convictions obtained. In some of the other districts suspicions of fraudulent work exist, but with duties at headquarters in connection with jails and hospitals and difficulties in means of communication, District Medical officers complain that they cannot give vaccination the attention it requires. Attitude of people towards vacci- nation. 11. There is no reason to believe that in any municipality or in the districtsgenerally there exists any very strong antipathy to vaccination among the people. As in other provinces, mothers do not like to submit their infants to the operation, and do their best to delay it till the child is over a year old. As a rule, however, they understand the efficiency of vaccination in affording protection against small-pox. The Civil Surgeon at Sagaing reports that headmen of vil- lages clamour for a vaccinator when cases of small-pox appear. In the Upper Chindwin and the Shan States vaccination is said to be not popular, but no active opposition is encountered. The people, in fact, are accustomed to inoculation and can understand vaccination, but the Burman is very conservative in his ways and prefers his own old, though mischievous, usage to what he regards as foreign inventions. The Civil Surgeon of Meiktila found the attitude of the people op- posed to vaccination in parts of the district, especially at places where there was a Burman Government official. He reports that the civil authorities generally ex- erted their influence to popularize vaccination, but that some Burman officials, whilst expressing their willingness to aid, did in reality just the reverse, and that in certain places where there was a Burman Myoôk he found the people most in- tractable, whilst in remote villages in the interior of the district, away from such influences, he and his vaccinators were cordially received by the inhabitants and vaccination readily accepted. Compulsory vaccination 12. In districts vaccination is not compulsory, but considering the interestat stake and the danger to the community of epi- demic outbreaks of a fatal and mutilative disease like small-pox, Government officers of all grades are expected to use their influence with the people in promoting vaccination, which admittedly confers almost perfect security against death from small-pox, and is beyond comparison the greatest practical good which medical science can offer. The personal influence of dis- trict officials can do a great deal to assist the department in diffusing a knowledge of the benefits of vaccination, and in this matter the judicious use of official pres- sure is, it is submitted, not only legitimate but imperative. In municipalities the Act for the compulsory vaccination of children is in force, and wherever vaccination is defective, it is for the Municipal Committees to show cause why the provisions of the law have not been fully and systematically worked. The Burma Vaccination Law Amendment Act. 13. With a view to further provide for compulsory vaccination in Burma andavert the severe outbreaks of small-pox which have from time to time visited localities, especially the town of Rangoon, various measures had been dis- cussed, but opinions were not unanimous on the subject. The epidemic of 1898-99, however, emphasized the necessity for adopting measures by which emigrant coolies from Indian ports would be protected from small-pox. It was urged that any measure to be really effective must provide for the protection of unprotected 4
14 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. coolies before their arrival here, and as the Government of Madras were unwilling to move in the matter by causing coolies to be protected before being permitted to emigrate, it became necessary to take such steps as would, without undue inter- ference with trade or the labour market, afford this Government the means of having cooly emigrants protected. Colonel Sinclair, I.M.S., then Sanitary Commis- sioner and Superintendent-General of Vaccination, expressed himself as not being satisfied as to the contention that Indians were less well-protected than Burmans. The number of the latter class who came under treatment was so small that he considered it not safe to lay too much stress on the inference indi- cated. Notification of contagious diseases, he considered, to be defective in Rangoon, and he was inclined to the belief that Burmans and the better-to-do classes of Indians avail themselves of their greater facilities for concealment, and, but for this, that the small-pox statistics relating to them would more nearly ap- proach those relating to the cooly class, who have no friends and whose houses are barracks or lodging-houses. He pointed out that of 2,208 cases notified, no less than 476 or over 21 per cent. returned as unvaccinated were children, i.e., males under 14 and females under 8 years of age, all or the majority of whom should have been vaccinated. Moreover a larger proportion of fatal cases occurred amongst children returned as vaccinated than should have taken place had the protection been adequate. Colonel Sinclair was, therefore, of opinion that all available means for protecting the inhabitants of Rangoon had not been exhaust- ed. There were difficulties, but these he considered could be overcome by giving full effect to the provisions contained in sections 135, 136 and 172 of the Burma Municipal Act of 1898. The question was referred by Government to a select Committee of the Burma Legislative Council, the outcome of whose delibera- tions was the Burma Vaccination Law Amendment Bill, which has now passed into law as Burma Act No. II of 1900. Under the provisions of this Act, Municipal authorities can require unprotected persons to be vaccinated after due notice, and inmates of lodging-houses to submit forthwith to vaccination. Inoculation. 14. Inoculation prevails pretty generally throughout the province. In muni- cipalities the inoculator can be legally dealt with, but it is not infrequent to hear of inoculators working within municipal limits and the people countenancing them to such an extent as to posi- tively refuse to give any information on the subject. In the districts outside muni- cipal areas he appears to practice his calling without restriction, discrediting vacci- nation wherever he goes as it interferes with his means of livelihood, and spread- ing small-pox from village to village. Lymph supply. 15. Vaccination was carried on during the year by means of humanizedlymph through arm to arm transfer, and by glyceri- nated animal vaccine prepared at the Rangoon and Taunggyi depôts. In some municipal towns lanoline lymph obtained from Banga- lore was used to a small extent. No details have been given in district reports of the work done with the various kinds of lymph, but the results obtained by arm to arm vaccination would appear to have been good. This method of vaccination has obvious disadvantages and objections, and orders have issued that it must be discontinued as far as possible. (a) Rangoon.NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 15 ture is put down to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and to an increase under postage and packing charges owing to an increased demand for lymph. (b) Taunggyi.16 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. The increase in cost was due to the addition of one attendant to the estab- lishment and to the hire of calves at Rs. 5 per calf, which the local butcher used previous to 1899-1900 to supply free of charge. Considering the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply of calves at Taung- gyi, and the distance the station is from the line of railway, it would be advisable to remove the depôt to a more central station in an agricultural part of the prov- ince where calves could be readily obtained. The station of Meiktila would answer these requirements, where a depôt on an adequate scale might, it is sug- gested, be instituted for the purpose of supplying the vaccination establishments in Upper Burma with glycerinated lymph, the Rangoon depôt supplying Lower Burma. 16. Proposals in this connection, as well as for reorganizing the entire vaccination establishment, in order to secure better supervision, more general ex- tension of vaccination, and better quality of work, will be submitted to Govern- ment during the course of the current year.

The whole surface of the abdomen as far forward as the costal arch and inner surface of both thighs and the folds of the groins are carefully shaved. The shaved surface is then washed thoroughly with soap and warm water, and finally scrubbed with corrosive sublimate solution, 1 in 1,000, and carefully dried. The whole surface is then carefully scarified by parallel incisions crossing each other at right angles about ½ inch apart. The incisions are several inches long and extend in depth to the surface of the vascular layer of the skin. If the operation is carefully perform- ed and care be exercised that the incisions do not reach deeper, very little pain is caused to the calf; a certain amount of oozing of blood takes place from some parts of the incisions ; this is wiped off before it has had time to clot and so close the incisions. Vaccine glycerine lanoline paste is then rubbed into the whole extent of the incisions with a spatula and allowed to dry. A clean calico binder is then fastened over the vacci- nated area and the calf is returned to the stable, where it is placed upon a wooden platform with grass to lie upon, and loosely tied by head and legs to prevent it from licking or scratch- ing the parts operated upon. The calico binder is replaced by a clean one each morning. On the fourth day defi- nite signs of an eruption are visible, and the vesicles are generally sufficiently developed for scraping by the sixth day, i.e, about 120 hours after operation. Sometimes it is advisa- ble to wait another 24 hours to admit of the vesicles reaching their full development, but there is a risk in the dry weather of their drying up before the lymph can be collected, un- less their condition is carefully watched. As soon as the vesicles are ready for collection of the pulp, the animal is again tied upon the operating table in the same position as for vaccination. The operated surface is washed lightly with soap and warm water, and rubbed with corrosive sublimate solution, 1 in 1,000, and dried ; thick scabs, if present, are removed and all superfluous moisture care- fully got rid of. With a small silver scraper, or a scalpel, the vesicles are now removed bodily, the base being scraped once only. Care is taken to avoid collecting any blood with the lymph, but there is necessarily a small quantity mixed with the scrapings. The vesicles from the whole area having been scraped off and collected in a glass dish, the material so collected is carried to the work-room and carefully weighed, then mixed by grinding with an equal weight of pure glycerine, and stored in an air-tight bottle ; the calf has meantime had the scraped area dressed with boracic acid and starch, and is then put back in the stable. It is returned to its owner so soon as it has recovered from the last operation. The vaccine scrapings contain the whole substance of the vesicles including the thin cuticle covering them. This has to be very carefully ground in a glass mortar to break up the cuticle into very fine portions until the fluid becomes all but homogeneous in appear- ance and consistency. On the day after collection, the vaccine glycerine, which consists of equal parts of glycerine and vesicle scrapings, is again mixed and ground with an equal weight of pure glycerine, the resulting fluid being of the proportions of 1 part of vesicle scrapings to three parts of glycerine, i.e., 1 in 4. In the earlier months of the year under review I used anhydrous lanoline in prepar- ing the vaccine paste for distribution, following the method of my predecessor Dr. Fink. The proportions of the ingredients of the vaccine paste distributed were vesicle scrapings one part, pure glycerine one part, anhydrous lanoline two parts (strength 1 in 4). The lanoline paste had a tendency to become mouldy in the wet weather, and it also decomposed readily; after reading Dr. Copeman's treatise on vaccination and the prepara- tion of vaccine with glycerine, which has been found to retain its properties for many months in Europe, I decided to experiment with glycerine in the proportion of three parts to one of vaccine vesicles. I have found since using this method that the vaccine paste keeps perfectly sweet and free from smell for a long period, even up to two months after preparation, the longest period for which I have tested it. I found in a specimen of glycerine vaccine paste prepared in this way in August that it retained its potency for vaccinating children over six weeks from the date of preparation. Since January, however, I have not found that the vaccine paste prepared by this method has retained its efficacy for a period exceeding 15 days, and I attributed this to the poor quality of the vaccine obtained from the calves operated upon in February and March, which were thin and in poor condition. The Civil Surgeon, Myaungmya, has given his opinion that the vaccine glycerine paste now supplied by this institution is much superior to the lanoline paste supplied previously. But I must admit that during the last three months, January to March, the vaccine glycerine has shown a tendency to lose its efficacy sooner than used to be the case in the later months of 1899, although the method of preparation has remained the same. Beyond the poor condition of the calves used for operation, I am un- able to suggest any cause for the rapid deterioration of the efficacy of the vaccine paste pre- pared at this institution. For vaccinating the calves I use glycerine vaccine of a strength one in four (vaccine one part, glycerine three parts), to which I add lanoline two parts, making the strength of vaccine equal to 1 in 6. In this case I always use freshly-prepared vaccine glycerine

I found when I first began to manufacture glycerine vaccine paste of a strength of 1 in 4, that the results obtained on calves were less satisfactory than those obtained with the same vaccine paste in children, but that this glycerine paste, when further diluted with two parts of lanoline, produced a good result on calves, possibly because in the denser tissues of the calf the lano- line aided the penetration of the vaccine. I do not consider my experiments in this direc- tion conclusive, but I have always obtained better results by preparing the paste in this manner for vaccinating calves. From time to time I have imported lanoline vaccine paste from the Mysore Government Vaccine Institution at Bangalore wherewith to vaccinate calves whenever I found that the strain of vaccine in use at this depôt was deteriorating in potency. There is no doubt that the vaccine does deteriorate after a time by passing through a succession of calves at Taunggyi, and the strain requires to be renewed from time to time. Bangalore lanoline vaccine has usually given good results upon calves here, but when calves in poor condition have been vaccinated with this lanoline vaccine in the hot weather, they have given little better results than was obtained by locally prepared vaccine paste, showing in my opinion that the unsuitability of the calves, and not a fault in the method of preparing the vaccine paste, was responsible for the poor results obtained with Taunggyi vaccine paste. All instruments used in the preparations of the vaccine paste and in vaccinating and collecting the vaccine from the calves are carefully sterilized in boiling water before use. The lanoline and glycerine are sterilized by subjecting to the temperature of 212° Fahr. in a water-bath and for quarter to half hour. This sterilization of these ingredients of the vaccine paste is an innovation introduced by myself during the year under review; it was not the custom in the time of my predecessor so far as I can ascertain. I have not found that the glycerine paste retained its potency any longer through the glycerine having been sterilized by heat than when it was not so sterilized. Glycerine being itself a germicide as is shown by its destroying all extraneous bacilli in the vaccine mixed with it, within a period of four weeks, (vide Copeman on &quot;Vaccination: its Natural History and Pathology. Milroy Lectures, 1898),&quot; it would seem to be unnecessary to sterilize it by heat before mixing with vaccine pulp. Lanoline is no doubt rendered innocuous by sterilizing it, and vaccine paste prepared with it will probably keep sweet longer than if the lanoline is not sterilized. According to Copeman, lanoline possesses no germicidal properties, and at this depôt it has been found to allow of the growth of moulds upon the surface of vaccine paste prepared with it even when there was one part to four of glycerine mixed with it. A larger proportion of glycerine than this seems to be necessary to preserve the vaccine paste from the growth of extraneous baccilli and moulds. While operating upon the calves, and during the preparation of the vaccine paste, the clerk wears a clean cotton apron and cotton sleeves tightened around the wrists. The work of grinding the vaccine glycerine in a small glass mortar is prolonged and tedious, and occupies many hours during which the vaccine paste is liable to contamination by germs introduced from the air, the clothes of the operator, and other sources ; the glycerine should, in theory, destroy all such germs in time. A more complete safeguard would be gained by the employment of a grinding and mixing machine which performs in quarter of an hour the work which would take several hours to do by hand in a mortar. Glycerine takes over three weeks to completely destroy extraneous germs in the vaccine paste, and as the paste pre- pared here does not in many instances retain its potency longer than three weeks, it must be used before the expiration of that period, and therefore before the extraneous germs are all destroyed. Hence the necessity for rapid mixing to prevent entry of germs. The glycerine vaccine paste is distributed to other stations and to district vaccinators in small compressible leaden tubes containing 25 grains each. Experiment shows that ½ grain of glycerine or lanoline vaccine paste is sufficient for four insertions, i.e., one operation. I have myself fully vaccinated 50 children with 25 grains of glycerine vaccine from one tube obtaining 100 per cent. of successes, and 97 per cent. of successful insertions (this paste was prepared 20 days before the date of its use). The leaden tubes have two disadvantagesxviii. APPENDICES. This vaccine preserves its efficacy for from six to nine months, or longer in England. I wish during the coming year to carry out some experiments in the preparation of vaccine glycerine of this composition to be distributed in glass capillary tubes, the inclusion of air and the exposure of the stock of vaccine while operating on children would be thus prevented, a fresh tube being used for each child. For the preparation of vaccine glycerine lymph by this method, distilled water and a grinding machine are required, and a syringe for filling into any vessels of a larger size than capillary tubes ; these are referred to in paragraph 2 of this report under the head of &quot; appliances.&quot; 7. Results obtained with the vaccine paste prepared at the Government Vaccine Depôt, Taunggyi.APPENDICES. xix. ably possessed little potency for vaccination purposes and lost its efficacy quickly. Even in favourable weather, when the plentiful supply of green fodder makes it possible to obtain calves in good condition at Taunggyi, there is a tendency for the strain of vaccine cultivated at the depôt to deteriorate in potency. So that it becomes necessary to introduce fresh supplies of vaccine from other districts from time to time to improve the strain here. The considerable period which must elapse between the despatch of vaccine paste from Taunggyi and its receipt at distant stations, such as Lashio and Kindat, has been responsible for its deterioration on several occasions, thus it sometimes reaches Kindat over 14 days from date of preparation and cannot always be brought into use at once after receipt there. During the year under review the following numbers of primary operations performed with their results have been reported:xx. APPENDICES. Hospital Assistant of some year's standing, able to act upon his own initiative and respon- sibility in the Civil Surgeon's absence, shall be put in charge of the depôt under the Civil Surgeon as heretofore. In my opinion a Native of India would be the best class of person for the post, and he should not be required to perform any duties outside his own depôt office, such as clerical work in the Hospital. It would then be possible for the Civil Surgeon to proceed on tour at any time without having to keep his attention constantly turned towards the vaccine depôt for fear that the work should miscarry in his absence. Under present arrangements I have felt myself unable to go far from headquarters, or to make a prolonged tour in the district on this account I do not think the work of the depôt can be increased in the direction of improvements in the quality or quantity of vac- cine paste prepared and distributed, unless an experienced and reliable subordinate be put in subordinate charge of the institution. With the present staff I can carry on the work as heretofore with varying success, but the keeping up of a sufficient supply of vaccine paste to meet all demands has proved the cause of great anxiety to me throughout the year, and if the demand is to be increased, I do not think it can be adequately met under present arrangements. The special work of the vaccine depôt would be quickly learnt by an intelligent man. So that in making a selection of a suitable man for the post, no previous training in this work need be required of him. A still more serious obstacle to the satisfactory carrying on and expansion of the work of this institution is the difficulty experienced during the dry season, from February to the end of May, in obtaining calves for vaccination purposes. This difficulty caused much interference with the work of the depôt in 1899, and again this year its recurrence has put a stop to the carrying on of the work at Taunggyi. The calves supplied for use during February and March were thin and in poor condi- tion, and were procured with great difficulty, and finally at the end of March the butcher who has hitherto supplied them informed me that he could do so no longer. I have been unsuccessful in my endeavours to obtain calves through any other agency. The difficulty in obtaining a plentiful supply of calves here at this season is due to the lack of water, and consequently of pasturage on this (Taunggyi) plateau. The majority of the cattle are driven off to lower levels, where better pasturage can be found, and those that remain here are in wretched condition, and the calves are unfit for use in the vaccine depôt. They fail to de- velope a satisfactory eruption after being vaccinated, and the vesicles dry up before the lymph pulp can be collected, and vaccine paste prepared from these vesicles has little potency and rapidly deteriorates. I have now made arrangements of a temporary nature for the carrying on of the vaccine depôt work at Thamakan, the headquarters of the Myelat subdivision. There more calves and of a better quality than can be obtained at Taunggyi are to be found, and it is easier to make arrangements for the carrying on of the depôt in connection with the Civil Dispen- sary there than it would be elsewhere, where there are no other Government institutions. But even there pasturage is poor in quality and deficient in quantity, and grass has to be brought from a long distance and at considerable expense. Still the work is being carried on, and vaccine paste was prepared and distributed from that place at the beginning of the year now commencing (1900-1901). The arrangement is of the nature of a makeshift, but without it the work of the depôt would have come to a complete stop. It will thus be seen that as regards the question of an adequate supply of calves for the work of the depôt, the institution is still in an experimental stage after three years of working. It must have been thought when the work was first instituted that a plentiful supply of calves was to be obtained here at all seasons. In the annual reports for 1897-98 and 1898-99, as in this year's report, this difficulty has been exposed and dwelt upon with increasing earnestness. At the end of the period which this report covers the supply of calves has actually come to an end, and a fresh de- parture is necessary if the work of the institution is to be carried on during the dry season. There are valleys in this district where water and pasturage during the dry season are both plentiful. The nearest of these to headquarters is Myaungwe valley, the distance to a situation favourable for the working of the vaccine depôt being at least 12 miles from headquarters at Taunggyi. In Bawnhin valley, 26 miles from Taunggyi, similar favourable conditions are found, but it has as yet been found impossible to arrange for calves to be brought from these places to Taunggyi for use at the vaccine depôt. However, it may be possible in the next hot season to make same arrangement of this sort or to establish the depôt at one of these places during the dry weather as is now tried at Thamakan. The lack of potency and rapid deterioration of the vaccine paste which has lately been prepared at Taunggyi is undoubtedly due to the poor condition of the calves used for its cultivation; and given a plentiful supply of suitable calves, I believe that any desired quantity of vaccine paste of ordinary efficiency could be prepared here.

NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1900-01. THE report on vaccination consists of brief notes and the usual statements. Statement I. 1. The average number of vaccinators employed during the year was 190, whilst the sanctioned staff is 192. Henzada employed 14 vaccinators for six months and 15 for the remainder of the year, and the Southern Shan States four vaccinators for one month and three for the remaining eleven months. 2. Statement No. I.2 NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1900-01. (47.54), Thôngwa (51.28), Upper Chindwin (52.90), and Sagaing (54.69). In most other districts the rates ranged between 100 and 80 per cent. The low rate of success attained in the districts above mentioned is chiefly attributed to the indifferent quality of the lymph supplied, especially the Taunggyi lymph, but these results might also be not incorrectly put down to unskilfulness in the use of the manufactured virus. One Civil Surgeon remarks &quot;that every case on which I operated myself and which I was able to verify the result was success- ful.&quot; The Civil Surgeon, Chin Hills, remarks that a large number of the vaccina- tions were carried on by Hospital Assistants on column duty, and as the column moved on the cases were never seen again. Infantile vaccination. 5. The total number of infants under one year of age available for vac- cination in Municipal towns was 17,970, while the number shown to have been protected were 21,189. The table prescribed by the Government of India in letter No. 89-Sanitary, dated the 8th January 1900, is given as Appendix B and shows the amount of infantile vaccination performed in Municipalities. The excess of infants protected over infants available can scarcely be satis- factorily explained, but Civil Surgeons attribute the excess to outsiders who came into the towns for temporary residence or on business. Statement II. Cost. 6. The total expenditure on account of vaccination, including all charges,was Rs. 78,853-9-4 as compared with Rs. 73,683-7-5 in the previous year, and the cost of each successful case As. 3-5 as against As. 2-7 in 1899-1900. The increase in expenditure is thus accounted for NOTES ON THE STATISTICS OF VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1900-01. 3 There was much difficulty in obtaining calves ; consequently the break in the supplies of lymph to which this gave rise proved very inconvenient and dis- appointing to District Officers. Owing to these unsatisfactory results the aunggyi depôt has been closed and the establishment transferred to Rangoon where the lymph supply of the province will be manufactured until specially constructed buildings have been erected at Meiktila, or other convenient station where an ade- quate supply of calves can uninterruptedly be obtained. To ensure success the Vaccine Laboratory must be constructed on sanitary principles on the same lines as a modern hospital, where the principles of aseptic surgery have to be rigidly adhered to. Plans of the building required are being drawn up by the Public Works De- partment, and the necessary plant has been ordered from England. At the Rangoon Depôt glycerinated lymph was manufactured to the extent of 47 ounces, sufficient for about 60,000 operations, and issued in compressible leaden capsules and glass capillary tubes. That sent out in the leaden capsules was of a strength of 1 in 3, equal parts of vaccine, glycerine, and distilled water. The capillary vaccine was of the strength of 1 in 6, namely, 1 part of vaccine, 2 of glycerine, and 3 of water. The difficulty hitherto experienced in the filling of the tubes has been over- come by the use of a little vulcanized rubber &quot;vaccine expeller.&quot; This little in- instrument is for driving the lymph out of the tubes without the application of the lips of the Vaccinator; by reversing the action the glycerinated lymph can as easily be drawn into the tube, and even without previous practice an assistant can with it fill from 80 to 100 tubes in a quarter of an hour. Capillary tubes can be rapidly and accurately filled, and the method is a great improvement on that of drawing up the vaccine by suction with the lips. &quot; Husband's &quot; capillary tubes, which are of very small calibre, have been substituted for the large tubes as used at the Local Government Board Vaccine Institute and the Jenner Institute in London. One of these tubes holds enough vaccine for eight or nine operations. They are more easily filled and are more convenient for the public vaccinator, operating upon a number of children at one time. Stetement II. The total cost of the Vaccine Depôt at Rangoon amounted to Rs. 2,057, of which Government paid Rs. 881. The Municipality have proposed that Govern- ment should relieve them entirely of the maintenance of the depôt. At Taunggyi the cost amounted to Rs. 1,386. District work throughout the province was, as far as possible, carried on with prepared animal lymph, but owing to the depôts failing to meet demands arm-to- arm vaccination had at times to be resorted to. Attitude of the people. 9. Inoculation is carried on throughout Burma and Civil Surgeons gene- rally report passive opposition to vaccination in favour of inoculation as the attitude of the people. There is no law to touch the inoculator outside Municipal areas, and since the courts have ruled that inoculation is not an offence under section 269 of the Indian Penal Code the inoculator drives his trade with impunity and, working side by side with the vaccinator, often forces the latter out of the field, thus keeping up a perpetual source of infection. Considering the gravity of the evil, it is, I sub- mit, a fair case for the Government to interfere and, in the interests of the common good, to suppress the inoculator. RANGOON : C. C.

The vaccinators worked directly under the supervision of a Civil Assistant Surgeon for about a year, from Novem- ber 1900, and there was therefore less opportunity for falsifying the returns. Ow- ing to demands for Assistant Surgeons elsewhere, this officer had to be with- drawn in November 1901, and I have not been able to replace him. The decrease in the Tharrawaddy district is said to be due to no arm-to-arm vaccina- tion being done, lymph being too dilute, and to more reliable returns. The Civil Surgeon, Bassein district, attributes the decline to non-prevalence of small-pox, paucity of subjects, and careless work done by district vaccinators coupled with marked opposition on &quot; the part of parents and often small officials.&quot; Two causes are assigned for the decrease in the Amherst district, namely, (1) less small-pox than the previous year and (2) inoculation, which the Civil Surgeon says, &quot; has ''been more extensively carried out than in former years, and this has had a most &quot;injurious effect upon vaccination, several villages having taken to inoculation &quot; which in previous years readily accepted vaccination.&quot; In Upper Burma districts the Civil Surgeons report that among other causes the falling off is mainly due to want of regular supplies of lymph and paucity of subjects, the people not being favourably disposed towards vaccination.

NOTE AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1902-03. Statement I. The report consists of brief notes and the usual statements. 1. Strength of staff.2 NOTE AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1902-03. Period. RATIO PER 1000 OF Population successfully vaccinated. Mortality from small-pox. 1897NOTE AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1902-03. 3 The quality of the lymph was on the whole satisfactory. It is tested at the depôt before distribution. Nevertheless the results as stated by Civil Surgeons are often conflicting. Thus a paste, proved active, was sent to Katha and to Thama- khan in the Southern Shan States and the reports received from Katha showed a successful result of 92 per cent. whilst at the other station it was stated to have entirely failed. Some of the identical paste was subsequently used by the Civil Surgeon, Meiktila, who obtained 100 per cent. of success. Again, paste manufactured from one particular calf was sent to the Civil Sur-. geons of Meiktila, Toungoo, Myitkyina, Taunggyi and Mogôk. Reports from the four first-mentioned stations showed successful results varying from 75 to 100 per cent. while Mogôk reported total failure. The cause of failure is apparently want of skill or careless storage on the part of vaccinators. In March and April, owing to the high temperature, the results of calf vacci- nation at the depôt was not as satisfactory as in the cold weather; I visited the depôt at Meiktila' on several occasions and cannot speak too highly of Captain Penny's work there. There was some difficulty at first in ob- taining calves, but these he overcame with tact and management and the results attained have been on the whole satisfactory. When the new buildings are erected the depôt will have better facilities for carrying on the work. RANGOON: C. C. LITTLE, COL., M.D., I.M.S., Superintendent-General of Vaccination, Burma.

RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA For the years 1902-03 to 1904-05. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma in the General Department, No. 1Z.-15, dated the 13th July 1905. READ2 RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION results claimed are now reported to be more in accordance with general experience is perhaps a sign that the returns are beginning to represent the reality with some degree of accuracy. Thoroughly satisfactory and trustworthy returns can only be obtained by means of the employment of skilled and trustworthy operators and by careful supervision and constant inspection by an efficient agency. This result, it is hoped, may be attained as a result of the complete reorganization scheme for Native Superintendents and Vaccinators which has recently been sub- mitted for the approval of the Government of India. His Honour observes that the average amount of work performed by each vaccinator during the three years under review has fallen considerably short of the 2,000 primary operations which were stated by Colonel Little in the Report for the years 1899-00 to 1901-02 to represent a fair year's work for a single operator. It is possible that Colonel Little's estimate was too high, but the point is one which should receive attention. 4. The Lieutenant-Governor concurs generally in the remarks contained in the Report on the subject of inoculation. Before inoculation can be prohibited it is necessary that vaccination throughout the Province should be improved. Sir Herbert White believes that the opinion expressed by Colonel Macrae is correct, and that there is little or no feeling of active resistance towards vaccination in Burma. He believes that if vaccination is properly performed with good lymph, so that the operation is generally successful, the mass of the people have no objection to it. Successful vaccination will bring about its own appreciation and the inoculator will then be in less demand. In Rangoon, where the attitude of the people is said to be hostile, the population is mainly Indian and the conditions are different from those prevailing in the remainder of the Province. The Super- intendent-General of Vaccination is requested to consider whether the alleged hostility of the people of Rangoon towards vaccination may not be due to defects in the system which it may be possible to remedy. 5. The results of the working of the vaccine depôt at Meiktila have so far proved somewhat disappointing, but His Honour is glad to learn that the present Superintendent, Major Entrican, takes special interest in the working of the depôt and that there has been an improvement. He trusts that the efforts to make the depôt a thoroughly efficient source of supply of lymph will not be relaxed and that they will be successful. 6. The Lieutenant-Governor has read with interest the remarks in paragraph 9 of the Report as to the possible expediency of limiting the performance of vac- cination to certain seasons of the year. His Honour is aware that Colonel Macrae, who has only recently taken charge, has this question under consideration. It is hardly necessary to say that a comparatively small number of operations success- fully performed and ensuring immunity is likely to do more to secure the popularity of vaccination than a large number performed ignorantly and inefficiently. The per- formance of vaccination under adverse climatic conditions seems to be undesirable and to be likely to bring vaccination into discredit. The Lieutenant-Governor will cordially support any proposals for reform in this respect or in other matters in which experience shews improvement to be attainable. His Honour is sanguine of the results of the improvement of the personnel of the operating and supervising staff if the work is performed on sound and scientific lines. 7. Although the attention of Subordinate Magistrates and Executive Officers was again, in the year 1903, called to the importance of the exercise of their per- sonal influence and authority in support of vaccination, His Honour is not satis- fied that sufficient regard is paid to these orders. He desires Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners to impress on Subdivisional and Township Officers that it is their duty, in the course of their tours, to take every opportunity of explaining to the people the uses and advantages of vaccination and the dangers of inocula- tion. These officers are constantly among the people ; and if they are themselves in sympathy with the vaccination system, the extent to which they can promote its acceptance by the people is incalculable. His Honour commends this matter to the earnest attention of all officers concerned.

His Honour desires to record that Colonel Little, I.M.S., who was in charge of the Department during the period under review, devoted continuous attention to measures intended for its improvement, and that the scheme now under the con- sideration of the Government of India is based on his proposals. The Lieutenant- Governor thinks that thanks are due to Colonel Little for the interest taken by him in the improvement of the Vaccination Department. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, W. F. RICE, Offg. Secy. to the Govt. of Burma.

The establishment employed during the triennium as in the marginal statement shows that the vaccination staff increased by two District Super- intendents, two Native Superintendents and 39 vaccinators. In 1902-03 there was an increase of 19 vaccinators, 1903-04 of 11 vaccinators, 1904-05 of 9 vaccinators. A re-organization scheme for the appointment of Native Superintendents of Vaccination for the following districts2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION legitimately obtain this high number, they resorted to falsifying their registers, and also falsifying the results of their work. Latterly Civil Surgeons have been ordered to impress on the men that what is required is a true account of the work done, and that during the cold and hot weather, when it is possible for them to travel through the district, a larger number could be secured than in the rainy weather, when the Burman objects to his child- ren being vaccinated and it is very difficult for the men to travel about. Vaccinators are also supposed, after visiting a certain number of villages and vaccinating as many children as are obtainable, to return to the first village about 10 days or a fortnight later, verify their results, and attend to any children whose arms have become sore and ulcerated. In order to get the best work out of vaccinators they must be closely watched and frequently inspected. For this reason a larger number and better class of Native Superintendents are required. In many districts Civil Surgeons cannot possibly find time to visit even half or one-third of the villages in their districts during the year. As a result the vaccinator's word must be taken for what he has done and as there is practically little chance of his being found out, when he is unable to obtain a sufficient number of cases to operate on, he simply adds fictitious names to make up the number required. During the past season several vaccinators were reported for bad work and submitting false returns. Some were dismissed and others received various punish- ments. Statement I. Year.

Age.IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1902-03 to 1904-05. 3 The Burman saya charges one or two rupees per case inoculated and for this he carefully attends the child throughout the illness. As there is no law prohibiting this practice of inoculation, and as the people still seem to prefer it to vaccination, Civil Surgeons and District Officers com- plain that it is not possible to suppress it. The Civil Surgeon, Pegu, states that inoculation is carried on in all parts of the district, especially on the borders of Toungoo and Hanthawaddy. The Civil Surgeon, Ma-ubin, says that inoculators have been busy during the last quarter of the year. Statement I. 8. Results by districts.4 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION During the period 1902-03, 386 calves were inoculated with 342 successes, during 1903-04, 557 with 456 successes, and during 1904-05, 252, of which 183 yielded lymph fit for issue. The percentage of success of primary cases for the periods was 87.14, 87.20 and 84.71. The percentage of success shows a decline. This is very unsatisfac- tory and the rates compare very unfavourably with those obtained in India. Numerous reasons are given for the poor results, which are ascribed to bad lymph, bad work, carelessness and sometimes wilfulness on the part of mothers, who rub off the lymph, etc. It is possible that in this Province, where communications are bad and distances great, the lymph deteriorates in transit; there is no doubt much unskilful work in addition. Vaccination is supposed to be carried on during the whole year in this Province. In Indian provinces it is only during half the year, from October to the end of March. In the hot weather and rains much of the unsuccessful work results. I think it might perhaps be desirable to limit the performance of vaccination in the hot and rainy months to the suppression of outbreaks of small-pox and to places within easy communication from the Depôt. Unsuccessful work and conse- quent re-vaccination prejudices the people against the operation. I will make enquiries as to the advisability of limiting the work as above suggested. I am informed that during epidemics people accept vaccination freely, and the successful stamping out of outbreaks creates most useful object-lessons and will largely help to popularize it. During the three years the lymph has deteriorated markedly during the months of April, May and June, owing it is supposed to the vaccine organism being affected by the high atmospheric temperature. This was especially so last year when, during April and the first part of May, the lymph was very poor in quality ; at the end of May all inoculations on calves failed and supplies could not be sent out. Bangalore, Shillong and Rangoon lymph were tried without success. Finally a child was brought from Mandalay, where arm-to-arm vaccination had been carried on. From this child's arm a calf was successfully inoculated and a new strain of lymph started. Lymph was again issued to the Province in the end of June with a general improvement in recorded results. The reason for this temporary failure of lymph supply is attributed to high temperature, calves obtainable being poor and weakly and weakening of the lymph strain by continual inoculation from calf to calf, which appears after some time to diminish the potency of the lymph. Re-vaccination from a child, however, restores its original strength. The outturn of lymph for the period was lanolinated lymph for 472,489 cases, glycerinated for 14,340 cases. The average cost of each case was 1.92 pies. No conclusion has yet been arrived at as to the best form in which to issue lymph. Glycerinated lymph in capillary tubes has been tried with favourable results ; it is less liable to contamination, but its longevity is only 10 or 14 days, while lanolinated lymph keeps and is reliable up to three weeks or a month. Numerous experiments have been made by the Superintendent throughout the year and it is hoped that a conclusion will soon be arrived at as to the most suitable medium for this province. Credit is due to Major Entrican for good work performed at the depôt. Statement II. Year. Establish- ment. Travelling allow- ance. Contin- gencies. Total. Average cost per case. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs.

NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1905-06. The administration of the Vaccination Department during the year was successively in charge of Colonels Little, Macrae and myself. Lieutenant-Colonel Frenchman held charge of office duties for three weeks between the interval of the departure of Colonel Little and arrival of Colonel Macrae. Statement No. II. 2. The strength of the establishment was as follows :2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION (7,954), and Thatôn (6,134). These results reflect creditably upon the Medical Officers concerned, namely, Captain N. P. O'Gorman Lalor, Major Pridmore, Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, and Local Assistant Surgeon Maung Tha Nu. Statements Nos. I and III. 7. The total average number of cases operated upon by each vaccinator amounted to 1,956, against 1,706 of the preceding year. Medical subordinates in charge of dispensaries contributed 17,507 cases to the total stated. Statements Nos. I and III. 8. A decrease of 1,707 cases occurred in Upper Chindwin. This may be regarded as sufficiently accounted for by the difficulties met by vaccinators owing to unusual flooding of certain areas. In Prome, an unsatisfactory decrease of 2,054 cases occurred. The Civil Surgeon considers this result as due to the employment of more honest and reliable vaccinators than hitherto. Pending inspection of the area concerned, this statement, which implies a very heavy indictment, may be accepted. In the case of Tavoy, however, a decrease of no less than 8,651 cases cannot be regarded with equanimity. The Civil Surgeon has attempted to account for the results by stating that the population was so fully protected by vaccination as to lead to the serious decrease of cases named. This is certainly untenable, even if the intercensal rate of increase be not taken into account. Statement I. 9. In the Municipality of Rangoon, the increase of 24,081 cases was largely due to belated vigour in vaccinating, following the severe epidemic of small-pox which prevailed during the year. During this epidemic, there was a total of 3,975 cases with 1,276 deaths. No such heavy incidence of small-pox has occurred in the town of Rangoon since 1883. The popular lay opinion was that this result was brought about by introduction of small-pox into Municipal limits by coolies from India. Major Williams, the Health Officer, however, has secured from the Port Health Officer a statement showing that inspection and segregation of incoming passengers is so efficient as to put this possibility, as an important cause, aside. On the opposite, Major Williams is able to show that the period of the increase of the disease corresponded with the entrance into the town of coolies (who were already in the country) on their return from surrounding districts, where they had been engaged in the paddy harvest. 10. Arrangements for checking the spread of epidemics of small-pox in the Rangoon Municipality are certainly defective in respect to staff. For a prolonged period, preserved vaccine has been produced in a local depôt; but the Health Officer shows that he is unable to maintain transmission of vaccine from calf to calf without resorting to the Bangalore Vaccine Institute for fresh stock. I would add that, in my opinion, no other result could possibly be expected from the hands of the most experienced officer, as the whole arrangements as to stabling calves are absolutely bad. Indeed, I have seen vaccine pulp gathered in this depôt that I would elsewhere have refrained from using under any circumstances. I have represented to the Municipality that their depôt does not fulfil modern requirements without, however, securing any attention to the matter. Appendix B. 11. In the Municipalities of Letpadan, Pryapôn, Taungdwingyi and Kyaiklat, work was evidently careless, as less than half of the available cases of infants were vaccinated. Statement No. I. 12. The rate of success in the total primary cases in the Province, after omitting unknown results, amounts to 90.80 per cent. In the Rangoon Munici- pality, although there existed the obvious advantage of little exposure to high temperature of preserved vaccine, beyond that necessary for the few hours during which operations were conducted, the total rate of success, namely, 84.86 per cent. was decidedly poor. This, however, is an improvement upon the prece- ding year when it was 73.67. In the Hanthawaddy District, the rates of 76.34 per cent. and, in Thatôn, 73.13 per cent. are excessively low. The total variation is between the figure stated for Thatôn and the extraordinary result of 9,620 cases with a success rate of 100 per cent. in the case of Yamèthin. It may be safely said that the latter figure is out of place in an official report. Enquiries will be made as to how this hitherto unexampled result has been arrived at. Statement No. I. 13. The total re-vaccinations amounted to 54,297. This number is certainly much smaller than is desirable ; as both European and recent Indian records point to the necessity of the confirmation of the immunizing influence of infantile vaccination, by a repetition of the operation about the age of puberty. The importance of urging the population to accept re-vaccination, rests in the fact that
IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1905-06. 3 whilst an unprotected population suffers chiefly in respect to children, unless revaccination be resorted to in a population protected only by infantile vaccination, adult lives are in danger. Hence, it is a healthy sign that the Municipality of Rangoon is, at the present time, considering the advisability of asking for powers to enforce re-vaccination. Statement No. I. 14. The success rate of re-vaccination varied from 100 per cent. to 1.92 in a total of 52 cases. As to the first figure, it may be accepted, having regard to the small number (2) treated; but there must be some error in respect to the latter cases. The whole subject of success rate of re-vaccination depends upon so many factors that it is not desirable that the matter should be expatiated upon; but the chances are, judging from my own work, including vaccinations of persons who have suffered from small-pox and who have been inoculated, that the rate is low. 15. The vaccine lymph used was entirely bovine obtained from Meiktila Vaccine Depôt, except in the case of Rangoon which, as already stated, is supplied by its own depôt. All reports go to show that the supply was trustworthy.* As, however, exhibited by the varying rates of success shown in Statement No. I, it is but one stage in progress to place at the disposal of the vaccinator trustworthy material; it still remains for the vaccinator to under- stand how to use it with full advantage. It need hardly be said that with men of the grade of education now available as vaccinators, all possible results are not secured by them. Irrespective of careless exposure of the material to the sun, there exist varying methods of performing the operation that go towards diminish- ing the chances of success. Much in this respect can be done by Civil Surgeons training the men to perform the operation on uniformly recognized principles ; whilst during the next year, it is hoped to equip each vaccinator with &quot;vaccine carriers&quot; that will protect the vaccine as far as feasible during transport from sun influence, and at the same time provide for the requirements of asepticism. Three forms of vaccine were used, namely, lanoline-vaccine, glycerinized-vaccine, and quinated-vaccine. The latter form was excogitated by Major Entrican. It con- sists of a proportion of bihydrochloride of quinine in sterile mucilage, stained with cochineal. At the time of his original efforts, Major Entrican was unaware of the fact that this form of quinine had been previously used by Dr. Alan Green in experiments for the killing of extraneous micro-organisms, but the curious choice of media had not been forestalled and these certainly serve their purpose. Quinine was, however, put aside by Dr. Alan Green, in virtue of its effect in gradually modifying the vesicle. That whilst recognizing its influence, however, up to a certain period, this modifying influence may be disregarded and a vaccine less loaded with organisms be produced, is testified to by Major Entrican. In com- paring the various vaccines issued he shows, as experience in India already amply testifies, that where duration of vitality is concerned lanoline easily leads as the preferable medium, but he points out that in the unskilful vaccinator's hands the more fluid glycerine forms are more readily manageable. This, of course, is a mere matter of training men to certain procedures. The whole subject, however, is being carefully worked out by Major Entrican, and as he takes a keen interest in the subject of the cultivation and preservation of vaccine, I have no doubt interesting results will be secured. But, in the meantime, his report goes to support the opinion as to the necessity of more uniform methods and more skilled training of vaccinators. An interesting matter in connection with Major Entri- can's work in the Vaccine Depôt has been the production by him of two machines for the filling of lanoline-vaccine in tubes, and of glycerinized and quinated lymph in capillary tubes, respectively. He has produced, in both cases, decidedly ingeniously contrived apparatus, which fulfil efficiently in a few minutes work that, under other systems, would demand several hours tedious labour. 16. On the subject generally of organization of the Vaccination Department, Government has directed me to furnish a report, and I trust that these and other matters will, during the current year, be fully attended to.

NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. Statement No. II. The total strength of the establishment during 1906-07 consisted of 32 Native Superintendents and 244 Vaccinators. Ten of the former receive their pay from Government, and 22 from local authorities. 2. Twenty-six Native Superintendents of Vaccination underwent a course of training at the Meiktila Vaccine Depôt. Of these, 20 passed their examination successfully, and they were duly posted to their districts; so that, at the present time, of the total districts 13 still remain without the supervision of a subordinate inspecting officer. This is a defect that obviously requires remedy. Under my predecessor Colonel Little's scheme, which was given effect to by the entertain- ment of the extra Native Superintendents referred to, it was hoped that Burmans could be induced to join for training as probationers on a stipend of Rs. 10. So far this effort has proved unsuccessful, as only four men joined during the year. In view of the existing small pay allowed, the present class of vaccinator is very inferior in general education and trustworthiness. Statement No. IV. 3. The following table exhibits the amount of primary vaccination as fulfilled by the various agencies :2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION calmly with vaccination wherever it could be received voluntarily, and thus, by offering ocular demonstration, prove that vaccination methods were not to be distrusted. In localities not directly affected by &quot; plague scare,&quot; increase has been exhibited. Thus, Akyab District shows a very good increase of 8,307. Tavoy, which was singled out last year as an instance of unsatisfactory results, has shown a satisfactory increase of 4,787. Appendix B Statement No. I. 5. In Municipalities in which compulsory vaccination is in force, the accuracy of work varies very considerably. To judge results of infantile vaccination merely by registered births with deductions for deaths of infants, takes no note of emigration or immigration, and, on the other hand, is based upon registration which, it may be taken, does not include the full number of births. There is therefore room for error on both sides. Thus judged, however, the following towns were found to have returned less infantile vaccination than warranted by their own statistics, Akyab, Kyaukpyu, Sandoway, Gyobingauk, Letpadan, Thônzè, Pyapôn, Kyaiklat, Ngathainggyaung, Henzada, Thatôn, Kyaikto, Tavoy, Toungoo, Shwegyin, Sagaing, Shwebo, Kyauksè, Taungdwingyi, and Meiktila. In the Municipality of Rangoon, the work performed was less by 7,256 cases than in the previous year. In 1905-06, 45,450 cases were performed, or an excess of 24,081 over the previous year. This was due to special efforts by the Health Officer (Major Williams, I.M.S.) in reference to the severe epidemic of small-pox, which was at its maximum in the first half year of 1906. During that period the mills were systematically searched, with the result of 30,308 persons being re-vaccinated. Statement No. I. Statement No. V. 6. The total successful vaccination rate for the whole Province for primary cases, excluding those classed as &quot;unknown,&quot; was 90.65 per cent. and re-vaccina- tion 52.39 per cent.* In primary cases in 3.79 per cent. the results were not traceable, and in the case of revaccinations, 21.14 per cent. In the latter case, the figure is very heavy, and emphasizes the necessity for more and better inspec- ting agency. Whilst vaccinators reported a success of 90.65 per cent. of primary vaccination, Civil Surgeons, on their inspections, found the average to be 89.20 and Native Superintendents 88.28 per cent. By the former agency, 60,290 cases were inspected and by the latter 56,372. Statement No I. 7. In Rangoon Town, primary vaccination yielded 83.10 per cent. of success against 84.86 in the previous year. Having regard to the fact that the vaccine is manufactured within Municipal limits, and is capable of being distributed and stored with all care as to the influence of temperature, the virulence of the vaccine employed, or the skill of the vaccinators concerned, must be greatly at fault. Whatever be the facts as to the latter, the chances are decidedly that the former is the chief factor in the case. The depôt at the disposal of the Health Officer is so ill-fitted for the successful cultivation of vaccine that he has reported he has never been able to continue a strain from generation to generation of calves, but has to trust to importation of stock from India or Meiktila. At time of my writing these Notes, there are indications of the Municipality awakening to the necessity of erecting a suitably built and suitably equipped depôt. It is out of the question that so important a matter, concerning the health of every family in the Municipal limits, should be dealt with otherwise than liberally and in accord with modern demands. 8. In Meiktila, Major Entrican continues to persevere in making the supply of vaccine for the whole Province with the exception of Rangoon, in the face of recognized difficulties as to the adverse temperature in certain months. Not only was this usual difficulty in satisfactorily cultivating animal lymph experienced, but he had reason to complain bitterly of the character of anhydrous lanoline with which he was supplied. Anhydrous lanoline for vaccination purposes must be free from glycerine fats, and water, and be constantly neutral. He, however, had to deal with an acid product that rapidly caused deterioration of vaccine with which it was brought in contact instead of preserving it. He has now been supplied with what it is hoped may prove a better variety. In consequence, a very large proportion of the total lymph issued was glycerinated. * The previous year's figures wereIN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1906-1907. 3 In speaking of these rival preparations, Major Entrican takes, in my opinion, a very reasonable view of their respective positions. He shows that where duration of vitality is requisite under tropical conditions, undoubtedly lanoline takes the first place. Thus, he states : &quot; For the preservation of good stocks of lymph nothing is equal to lanoline. In fact, from my experience, nothing else is any use at all. But it must be the best and purest lanoline. Anything else is a delusion and a snare. &quot; To this I would add that, lanoline being of a thick consistency, more manual skill on the part of the vaccinator is required than with the more fluid glycerine, and that this largely dominates statistical results. Thus, I have found vaccinators in this country first dab on an excess amount of lanoline-vaccine and then attempt to scarify through the opaque mass. The method is absurd and unsuitable. In vaccinating with this preparation, scarification should be first made, without causing oozing of blood, and by gentle stretching the lines should be made to gape, and thus the vaccine be worked into them. Training of vacci- nators as to such simple points makes all the difference between indifferent and excellent vaccination with a preparation indubitably peculiarly well suited for work in the tropics. 9. Major Entrican has undertaken a series of interesting experiments on the question of lymph preservation. He shows that &quot; quinated lymph &quot; need no longer be employed with sterilized mucilage, and that it is effective in producing a marked diminution of extraneous organisms. Many experiments were made on chloroform- ing for extermination of extraneous organisms, both of glycerinated and quinated lymph. His opinion is given thus : &quot; Chloroforming lymph which can be used within a week of its manufacture may be an advantage, but I have no doubt whatever as to its utter unsuitability in this country for lymphs which, to be of any use, must retain their vitality 10 to 20 or more days. The purification of the lymph is purchased at a cost out of all proportions to the advantage gained, and I have for ordinary purposes quite discarded the use of chloroform.&quot; Not only did he try the ordinary method of passing purified air impregnated with chloroform through lymph in bulk, and removing the excess chloroform by a current of air, but excogitated a new method of using a minute quantity of chloroform at the moment of sealing, by employing bottling wax dissolved in chloroform. Effects upon extraneous organisms were contrasted with control glycerinated specimens sealed by ordinary heat, with the result of exhibiting great superiority, so far as extraneous organisms are concerned, of the chloroform method. 10. The question of the extent to which small-pox inoculation is causative of spread of small-pox occupied the attention of Government during the year. It formed the opinion that, having regard to the strong prejudice of the people in its favour, the best course to meet it was to provide better facilities for spread of vaccination under skilled and correctly supervised staffs, aided by compulsory vaccination. With this end in view, I was required to select districts where urgency seemed to exist, and to submit proposals for the re-organization of the depart- ment within these limits. Consequently, no proposals for a general re-organization of the Vaccination Department, as promised in my last notes, were submitted to Government. In regard to selection of Districts, considerable correspondence ensued with Civil Surgeons ; and it was not till the completion of the official year I was in a position to place proposals before Government. 11. The sum of Rs. 850 was placed at my disposal for improving the equipment of vaccination in the Province. This has been utilized, and, as soon as the task of &quot; assembling &quot; the various articles, so as to form a compact portable haversack of non-conducting materials can be completed, they will be issued. 12. Having regard to the proved unsuitability of the high temperature, at certain seasons of the year, on the plains, I placed proposals before Government for the opening of a vaccine institute in the favourable climate of Maymyo.

It will be seen that the average of the three years was 41 District Superintendents, 31 Native Super- intendents and 246 vaccinators. This amounts to an increase on the average of the preceding triennium of two District Superintendents, 16 Native Superintendents and 23 vaccinators. The Native Superintendents were increased in 1906-07 from 16 to 32 and in 1907-08 to 44. The ten vaccinators sanctioned in 1907-08 were distributed to the following districts:2 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1905-06 TO 1907-08. Statement I. 3.

Inoculation and attitude of the people towards Vaccination.4 TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1905-06 TO 1907-08. light upon the true position of vaccination in this district, where active support of the vaccination staff by the Civil Authorities is urgently required. In Rangoon there has been a continuous decline in the numbers vaccinated during the past three years. This is, however, due to the great number of opera- tions performed in 1905-06 in the face of a severe epidemic of small-pox, when every available officer of the Sanitary and Plague Staffs was employed to push vaccination, and the mill owners gave ready assistance to the Municipal Health Officer in the work of vaccinating residents in their cooly lines. A similar proce- dure was continued in 1906-07, but with the decline of small-pox the interest of the public in the matter flagged, while the proportion of unprotected mill-hands was of course much smaller than before the epidemic. The success obtained in primary and re-vaccination in Rangoon has shown a marked increase since the last triennial report, and in 1907-08 96.34 per cent. of verified primary operations and 60.64 of re-vaccinations were successful, while the figures for 1905-06 were 84.86 and 55.41 respectively. Primary operations in infants have been particularly successful during the past twelve months in Rangoon; at most of the vaccination stations in the town verified successes rarely fell below 99 per cent. in any month. Statement III. 10. Dispensary Vaccinations.TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1905-06 TO 1907-08. 5 and Civil Surgeons in 1907-08 against 87.31 and 58.53, the highest figures for verification in the earlier period. A similar improvement is shown in the result verified by Native Superintendents. It is to be noticed that the Vaccinators returned a higher percentage of successes in primary operations than was verified by either class of inspecting officers, while their return of successful re-vaccinations was somewhat lower than that obtained on verification of their work. In 1907-08 the Civil Surgeons of the Chin Hills (1.04), Akyab (6.65), Pegu (8.71), Tharrawaddy (2.56), Bassein (7.36), Henzada (3.46), Toungoo (1.61), and Thatôn(4.42), verified but a very small percentage of the operations performed. In many cases the work at Headquarters leaves Civil Surgeons little leisure for district touring, but this cannot be said to apply to some of the stations named. The small amount of inspection duty performed at Tharrawaddy and Thatôn demands explanation. Hanthawaddy, Ma-ubin, Tavoy, Katha, Meiktila and Myingyan return a high percentage of verifications by District Superintend- ents. In Ma-ubin, Pyapôn, Amherst, Tavoy, Myingyan and Rangoon, percentages of the total primary operations varying from 63.99 to 94.77 were verified by Native Superintendents. Native Superintendents verified 40.05 per cent. of primary operations and 44.85 per cent. of re-vaccinations in 1907-08, but only 15.22 and 19.42 per cent. of each class of operations in 1906-07. The work done in 1907-08 was, however, a great increase on that of any year in the previous decade. Statement II. Year. Establish- ment. Travelling allowance. Contin- gencies. Total.

Major Entrican has continued his experiments with regard to the effects on glycerinated and quinated Vaccines, of sealing the contain- ing tubes by wax dissolved in Chloroform. The results of a series of carefully conducted experiments in which ''controls&quot; were at the same time carried out, have enabled him to conclude that this method considerably reduces the number of extraneous organisms, and does not appreciably affect the longevity of the lymph, as chloroform certainly does when used in the ordinary way. He considers that the continuation of these experiments on a large scale is fully warranted not only by his laboratory investigations, but also by the practical results obtained with Vaccines so sealed, in primary vaccination. With this view I concur, and consider that much credit is due to Major Entrican for the active scientific interest he has taken in the improvement and preservation of vaccine lymph for use throughout the province. The Health Officer, Rangoon, reports that the lymph supplied from the Municipal Vaccine Depôt has been much better, and almost without exception, of good quality, during the last year of the triennial period under review. No attempt was made at the depôt to pass a strain of lymph through a series of calves. It was recognised that better results were obtained by getting paste from the Banga- lore stock and vaccinating calves with it, than by attempting to start a local strain of calf lymph. 16.

Establishment. 2 NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1908-09. offered are reasonable and must be accepted as accounting for the decrease in the outturn of work. In several instances the obstacles to vaccination were the subject of correspondence during the year. In the Henzada District, for instance, there has long been a difficulty in getting men of reliability and energy to work as vaccinators in the district. The service is unpopular in this district and good men will not stay. The altogether unreliable statistics of work done, furnished by the older vaccinators resulted in the dismissal of the worst offenders by the Civil Surgeon in the pre- vious year, and in spite of much effort on his part, this officer has not been able to make any great headway against the prevalling apathy of the people and their distaste for the operation. Until all grades of Civil Officers in this district unite to persuade the people to accept the operation, and a better class of vaccinators can be induced to remain in the district, no marked progress is to be expected. There is no doubt that the severe plague and cholera epidemics, which have visited the Meiktila Division during the year, have produced an effect detrimental to the per- formance of vaccination in many parts of the districts. A similar factor was at work in the Toungoo District and in some instances the Civil Surgeon and Vaccinators were refused admission to the villages. No doubt other districts were affected to some extent in the same way. It has, however, to be remarked that the severe plague and cholera outbreaks in the Tharrawaddy District did not prevent the increase of vaccination work in that district. The same remark applies to the Prome and Bassein Districts. The effect produced by a small-pox epidemic in increasing the outturn of vaccination work is well recognised, but the plea put forward by the Civil Surgeon of Pyapôn that the falling off in the year under review is to be explained by the absence of small-pox does not carry weight, since there was no more small-pox in that district in the preceding year than in 1908-09. In the Pakôkku District, where there was a severe small-pox epidemic in 1907, the outturn of work rose by 796 primary operations in consequence of the vaccination staff being augmented in the year under review; there was, as might have been expected, a decrease in revaccinations consequent on the cessation of the epidemic. The large increase in the outturn of work in the Southern Shan States, nearly all in primary operations, was due to improved organisation of the vaccination staff, and to the special efforts made by the Civil Surgeons of Taunggyi and Loimwe, and is much to their credit.

The perfection to which the manufacture of the vaccine has been brought during his incumbency of the post is the best testimony to the devotion, skill and inventive genius displayed during several years by the late Superintendent, Major Entrican, and it is with much regret that I have to record the loss by this Department of his services owing to his being compelled by ill health to take leave. The present incumbent, Captain Good, has carried on the work with the greatest zeal, since he assumed office, and merits my thanks for his services. 10.

The influence of the plague epidemic was felt in Upper Chindwin, where there was a serious decrease in the number of operations for vaccination caused by the belief entertained by the people in the truth of rumours emanating from the Lower Chindwin District, to the effect that Government were spreading plague by means of vaccination. Magwe Division.NOTES AND STATISTICS ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEAR 1909-10. 3 is to the credit of the Native Superintendents of Vaccination. The total primary operations verified by Native Superintendents was 179,114 which is an increase of nearly 40,000 on the work of each of the two preceding years, of 120,000 on that of 1906-07, and of over 80,000 on that of 1905-06. The number of re-vaccinations verified was 35,430 of which Civil Surgeons verified 9,254 and Native Superintendents of Vaccination 26,176. The work of the Civil Surgeons showed a falling off of 2,057 verifications, while that of the Native Superintendents of Vaccination showed an increase of 4,934. Second only in importance to the great increase of work performed by Native Superintendents of Vaccination during recent years is the outstanding fact of the continuous decrease of verification work by Civil Surgeons. The number of primary operations verified by this agency has fallen steadily since 1905-06 from 75,650 in that year to 38,589 in 1908-09, with a slight recovery in the year under review. No doubt there is not the same necessity for the Civil Surgeon to see so large a proportion of the operations as before the institution of Native Superintendents of Vaccination. But the fall from 17.72 per cent. verifi- cations of total primary operations in 1905-06 to 10.42 in the year under review is too rapid to give confidence that supervision of the work of the Native Superin- tendents of Vaccination is everywhere thorough. An average of 10 per cent. implies that the ratio is much less in some districts, and the low rate of 0.87 in Tharrawaddy requires explanation as also do the ratios for Shwebo (2.02), Ruby Mines (0.20), Magwe (1.48).

During the year 8 Native Superintendents of Vaccination and 38 Appren- tice Vaccinators completed a full course of training at the Depôt. Captain J. Good, I.M.S., held charge as Superintendent of the Vaccine Depôt and Training School from April 1st to November 26th, 1909. He devoted much time and attention to the training of students and several of the apprentices and Native Superintendents of Vaccination attained marked success in the exami- nations, which must be attributed to a great extent to his personal efforts towards their instruction. He was succeeded by Captain Walker, I.M.S., on 26th Nov- ember, by Captain R. D. Saigol, I.M.S., on 26th February 1910, and by Captain H. A. Dougan, I.M.S., on 23rd March. All these officers have rendered excellent service in maintaining the high quality of the lymph prepared at the Depôt, and in supervising the training of students. Statement II. 9.

RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1908-09 TO 1910-11. Extract from the Proceedings of the Government of Burma in the General Department,2 RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1908-09 TO 1910-11. this or other reasons were removed from their appointments is not strikingly high. Still the fact remains that the work of the vaccinators has not been at all satisfactory. The average number of operations performed annually by each man fell from 1,721 in the previous triennium to 1,472. The pay of these men ranges from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 a month, and the Sanitary Commissioner states that he is addressing Government on the subject of improving their prospects. The Lieutenant-Gover- nor will be glad to consider any suggestions for the improved working of the Department; he considers, however, that the fault does not lie entirely with the vaccinators, but is very largely due to lack of trustworthy and efficient supervision. Their immediate supervising officers are the native superintendents, on pay varying from Rs. 25 to Rs. 60 a month, whose number has been trebled in the last six years. Sir Harvey Adamson is inclined to share the doubts of the Sanitary Com- missioner as to whether this increase has been justified by results. The work of the vaccinators needs careful supervision, but it is doubtful whether native superintendents on this pay can be trusted to supervise them adequately. The other supervising officers are the Civil Surgeons. It is admitted on all sides that these officers have not the time to superintend this part of their work effectively. A Civil Surgeon, who has a large hospital at head- quarters and several smaller hospitals at outstations, who is Vice-President of a Municipality, Superintendent of a Jail, and Sanitary Officer for the whole district, and who has probably in addition a certain amount of practice among the Europeans in his station which he cannot leave for long to his subordinates, cannot possibly find the time to tour his district and to inspect the work of the vaccinators thoroughly. That this difficulty is increasing is shown by the fact that Civil Surgeons only inspected 11 per cent. of the total number of primary vaccinations during the triennium, as compared with 16 per cent. in the previous period. All Civil Surgeons, however, have not so many claims upon their time that they cannot tour more frequently than they now do, and the Lieutenant- Governor hopes to see an improvement in this respect in future years. 3. The Sanitary Commissioner considers that the remedy lies in relieving the Civil Surgeons of much of their work at headquarters by giving them capable Assistant Surgeons, and so allowing them more time for touring. He also recommends the appointment of additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners, who would devote their whole time to touring and inspecting vaccination and sanitary works. The Lieutenant-Governor is prepared to consider proposals to this effect. At the same time His Honour thinks that more might be done under present conditions both by Civil Surgeons and by other district officials to further the objects of the Vaccination Department, and to overcome the distrust of vaccination which is at present so common among the Burmans. The Lieutenant-Governor wishes to impress most strongly on all district officials the necessity of doing all in their power in this direction ; much good might result if civil officers would occasionally take vaccinators on tour with them, would make a point of inspecting the Headmen's Vaccination Registers, and would endeavour to enlist the assistance of headmen and elders of villages by explaining to them clearly the advantages of vaccination over inoculation.
RESOLUTION ON THE TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1908-09 TO 1910-11. 3 The necessity for such action was impressed on officers in the Resolution on the last triennial report. His Honour regrets to see that it has had so little effect and trusts that no effort will be spared in future. 4. Two important Acts dealing with Vaccination were passed during the period under review; the Burma Prohibition of Inoculation and Licensing of Vaccinators Act, 1908, prohibits inoculation in any areas to which it may be extended; it has, however, only been extended to the Hanthawaddy and Pegu Districts as yet. The question of its further extension is now engaging the Lieute- nant-Governor's attention. The Burma Vaccination Law Amendment Act, 1909, gives power to Health Officers to enforce vaccination in certain circumstances in Rangoon and any other Municipality to which it may be extended, and also provides for the vaccination of immigrant coolies at Rangoon. Lack of funds unfortunately prevented the latter provision from being enforced up to the close of the period under review. It is too early yet to say what the effect of these two Acts has been. 5. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to note that Captain Dougan has kept the Vaccine Depôt at Meiktila in the same state of efficiency as when Major Entrican had charge of it; the success of this depôt is the most satisfactory feature of an otherwise discouraging report. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, G. B. H. FELL, Offg. Secretary to the Government of Burma.

This large discrepancy needs further inquiry. The excess in the other towns can be accounted for by children of immigrants and children born in rural areas being brought into the town for vaccination, and also by the fact that deaths of children which are recorded from the annual return may have taken place after vaccination leading to a reduction in the total of cases available for vaccination.

Evidently this circular is still in operation and has not been cancelled as it is quoted by a Civil Surgeon in his vaccination report for the present season as his reason for not carrying out more inspection work. The results of this circular are that preventive medicine is looked on as of minor consequence in a Civil Surgeon's work, and that the sanitation and water-supply of rural areas (except in the direct route from Dispensary to Dispensary) can receive little attention. Civil Surgeons state that they cannot leave their Headquarters asTRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1908-09 TO 1910-11. 7 84.4 per cent. and Tavoy and Mergui recorded 94.2 per cent. success. It is found that Liebrich's lanoline in tins gives uniformly good results provided the lanoline in the centre of the tin is used. The outer layers show an acidity of I C.C. N/10 Na OH per gramme and are always rejected. The present strain of vaccine has been maintained for five years and its strength has been reinforced by passage through 15 rabbits. Difficulty has been experienced in storing at a low temperature the glycerine lymph for ten days after manufacture. Cold store boxes and Thermos flasks have been tried but all have proved a failure. A small refrigerating plant is really required but the initial expense is more than can be afforded at present. The Depôt has unfortunately suffered severe loss in calves during the triennium from Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Rinderpest. Eighty-eight calves died in 1910-11 and 150 in 1909-10. The experiments in sealing tubes with parafine and wax in place of by heat are progressing favourably. At Rangoon 47 calves were vaccinated; 18,557 grains of scraping were obtained giving a higher average output than obtained at Meiktila of 391.72 grains per calf. The quality of the lymph has been satisfactory, producing 99.11 per cent. of successes in primary cases. The potency of the strain was not maintained by this Depôt. Seed lymph was introduced from Bangalore and Meiktila. 23. Training of Vaccination Staff.8 TRIENNAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BURMA FOR THE YEARS 1908-09 TO 1910-11. department is in its infancy. The vaccinators are mostly young, inexperienced men in whom the Burmese mothers have no trust. The men are not reliable. Fourteen permanent vaccinators and 3 temporary men have been dismissed, removed from the service, or their services dispensed with during the 1910-11 season for falsifica- tion, fraud, or acceptance of illegal gratification. Dr. Fink, Civil Surgeon, Myaungmya, has rendered admirable service to the Department by carefully investigating the work of the vaccinators in his district, leading to the dismissal of 4 permanent and 3 temporary vaccinators. The state of vaccination in Burma can be elicited from the following reports. Vaccinator Maung Po Shin is said to have been in league with inoculators with the result that children were inoculated and vaccinated at the same time. Scabs from small-pox pustules were said to have been mixed with the vaccine. The Civil Surgeon on examination found, between the upper and lower vaccination insertions, punctures due to inoculation. Lymph is also sold to inoculators to enable them to extort money by representing themselves as Government vaccinators and by excusing the people (on payment) from vaccination during the harvest season. At Shweoakchaung the headman reports that a Burman received Rs. 10 for excusing the inhabitants from vaccination. After receipt of the money he decamped leaving behind as a register of his work, a headman's vaccination register 10 years old from Thabyechaung. In Madawgyaung village the parents performed inoculation on their children (happily unsuccessfully). They had no objection to vaccination but were too poor to pay the vaccinator the fees he demanded. The statement that the people are too poor to pay vaccinators is corroborated by Rev. Father Fargeton. The appointment of private vaccinators who are entitled to receive fees, and the absence of a distinctive uniform for public vaccinators has left the people unable to recognize a Government vaccinator; this facilitates the acceptance of illegal gratification by vaccinators. Further, the system of appointing any person a Native Superintendent who has passed the necessary examination, and of not promoting an old and trustworthy vaccinator to the post has taken from the vaccinator all hope of promotion to a higher grade. It 'has left the country with a class of Native Superintendents of Vaccination who are young and inexperienced and in some cases unreliable, and who rise to a higher grade not by merit but at the expiration of every five years' service. During the 1910-11 season it was found necessary to dismiss one Native Superintendent of Vaccination at Tharrawaddy and to suspend one Native Superintendent at Pegu. The work of Native Superintendents of Vaccination requires constant supervision. As has been previously pointed out Civil Surgeons are practically prohibited to do much inspection of vaccination. Under the present scheme one Native Superintendent must be provided for the inspection of every three vaccinators. This is a costly proceeding and the results in my opinion will not be commensurate with the expense entailed. In place of increasing the num- ber of Native Superintendents of Vaccination it would be preferable from every point of view to increase the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners to be constantly on tours of inspection. At present one Deputy Sanitary Commissioner has been appointed for the whole of Burma which covers an area of 2,36,738 square miles. The inspection of an area of this size, when the difficulties of communication are taken into consideration, is an impossibility. The Local Government is being addressed on the subject of improvement in the vaccinators' prospects and the re-grading of the Native Superintendents of Vaccination not only by length of service but also by merit. It is hoped that the Secretary of State for India will sanction the appointment of one or more addi- tional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. S. A. HARRISS, M.B., D.P.H., Major, I.M.S., Offg.
