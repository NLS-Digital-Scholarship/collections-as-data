No. 33A. FROM CHARLES PLANCK, ESQ., Sanitary Commissioner, N.-W. Provinces, To B. W. COLVIN, ESQ., Offg. Secy. to Govt., N.-W. Provinces. DATED NAINI TAL, THE 19TH OCTOBER 1876, SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit herewith a report on Leprosy, as required by the orders of the Government of India, dated 5th March, 1876. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. PLANCK, Sanitary Commissioner, N.-W. P. REPORT ON LEPROSY IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES. [Prepared in obedience to the orders of the Government of India, contained in paragraph 8, of Resolution No. 1/136, dated 5th March, 1875, in the Home Department (Medical).] 1. The orders of Government above quoted were to the effect that the Sanitary Commissioners of Local Governments should, with the assistance of the Civil Surgeons, collect all facts bearing on the distribution and causation of leprosy; the principal facts to be noticed and recorded being- 1st, the extent to which leprosy exists in each district; 2nd, if localized, the locality in which it is chiefly found; 3rd, the peculiarities of this locality, if any, and the conditions in other respects under which the people therein live; 4th, the circumstances under which individual cases seem to have arisen, whether by contagion or hereditary taint, or from any other cause. 2. As a reliable foundation for this investigation, I have, during the past year, been engaged, in regard to this subject, in collecting, with the assistance of the Civil Surgeons, histories of leprosy cases from every district of the province. The history in every case being a record of facts in the following form:- Present history.-Name, age, sex, caste, present place of abode, form of leprosy suffered, present means of livelihood. Previous history.-Place of abode when first attacked with leprosy, age when first attacked, employment or means of livelihood when first attacked. Family history.-State of health during life of grandfathers and grandmothers, father and mother, uncles or aunts, brothers and sisters, as regards leprosy. It
?( 2 ) married, state of health of husband and wife as regards leprosy. Period of cohabi- tation since one was attacked. Number of children born of the marriage, number now living, number attacked with leprosy. 3. I am now is possession of the complete histories, as above, of 1,531 cases of leprosy, gathered from all parts of the province, as shown in the following statement:- Division. District. Number of histories received. Division. District. Number of histories received. KUMAUN. Garhwl 30 ALLAHABAD.           Cawnpore 30  Kumaun. 30  Hamrpur 10  Tari 20  Bnda 30 ROHILKHAND.

The history statements from Kumaun were prepared by the Superintendent of the Leper Asylum at Almora. The history statements from Mainpuri, numbering 472, and taking account of all the lepers in the district known to the police, were prepared by the District Civil authorities. 4. My request, in regard to this matter, was for a minimum of 30 histories from each district, hoping to encourage willingness for the work, and consequent accuracy, by asking little. But I need scarcely say I should have welcomed a more extended series of histories, even to a record in like form of every known case of leprosy in the Province. The record from Mainpuri seems to have been well effected, and recogni- tion of this self-imposed task-evidence of willing interest in the work-is certainly duo to the Magistrate. Undoubtedly, the possession of a history of every known case would have permit- ted the establishment of fixed conclusions in regard to all points in this investigation, and an addition of finality and perfection might have been impressed on the work I have to do in this direction, could my report have had an extended information like that for foundation. Yet I think it is likely that, by a careful consideration of the 1,531 cases collected, the principal facts, in regard to this matter, may be clearly enunciated, and a satisfactory answer provided to the enquiries propounded by the Government of India. 5. In regard to the extent to which leprosy exists in each district. This can be answered, perhaps satisfactorily, by quoting the figures of the Census Re- port of this province for 1872, as concerns this subject. For, amongst many important facts recorded in Mr. Plowden's admirable Census Report, the number of persons re- turned as lepers in each district has a place. In the succeeding statement, to the
( 3 ) ?number of lepers living in each district in 1871, I add the district population and the resulting ratio of lepers to each thousand of population :- Division. District. Population. Number of lepers in 1872. Ratio of leper to 1,000 of population. Division. District. Population. Number of lepers in 1872. Ratio of leper to 1,000 of population. KUMAUN.

Provinces  30,769,056 10,099 0.328 From this statement it appears that the disease is present in all districts, the greatest prevalence existing in the Himalaya country of Grarhwl and Kumaun and the trans- Jumma district of Bnda. 6. It seems very likely, however, that, although the record of the census, as regards this matter, may be accepted as a trustworthy guide to the relative prevalence of the disease in the different portions of the province, it does not correctly state the actual number of cases in existence in 1872. For example, in the Mainpuri district the cen- sus records 94 persons affected with leprosy there, whilst the nominal roll I possess gives a detailed account of 472 cases existing in that district in 1875. In Etah a numerical abstract of cases of leprosy known to the police in that district provides a total of 653 lepers, while the census total is only 387. A nominal roll of lepers in the Agra district in my possession shows a total of 530 lepers in that district, against a total of 320 in the census report ; and the Civil Surgeon of Gorakhpur estimates the number of lepers at many hundreds in that district-the census statement is 465. It may, I think, be reasonably supposed that many persons afflicted with the disease concealed the fact at the time of the census. And the probable conclusion is, that throughout the province considerably more than 10,099 persons afflicted with leprosy are in existence. That the total number of cases is likely to be greater, is further shown by a comparison of results recorded in regard to other countries where leprosy prevails. Thus, Dr. H. V. Carter records a ratio of 1.20 per 1,000 of population in Norway, and estimates the ratio in the Bombay Presidency to be rather under 1 per 1,000. The ratio arrived at by the help of the census figures in the North-West- ern Provinces is 0.33 per 1,000. 7. Although it may be accepted as absolutely true that leprosy is most preva- lent amongst the inhabitants of Kumaun, Garhwl, and Bnda, yet all the evidence I have been able to collect points to the fact, that no portion of these districts can be defined as the special home of leprosy. And the same remark holds good of all dis- tricts. It is true that many cases of the disease may be found, at one place, in all parts of the province, because lepers congregate where they can best gain a livelihood by
?(4) ?begging ; or, when Hindus, at places, where, after death, their remains may without diffi- culty be put into the Ganges. But, as a rule, the homes, or places of first attack of these people, are widespread throughout the district to which they belong. There are, however, exceptions to this rule, as will appear hereafter. 8. In illustration of this point, I proceed to investigate the facts as recorded in the 1,531 histories, and I find that the original homes, or places of first attack, in these 1,531 cases were situated in 960 different centres of population, in accordance with the following list :- District or country. Number of centres of Population in which one or more cases originated. Garhwl  49 Kumaun  30 Tari 9 Bijnor 22 Moradabad ...  13 Bareilly ... 15 Budaun ... 27 Shhjahnpur 6 Dehra Dn 1 Sahranpur ...  45 Muzaffamagar 11 Meerut  7 Bulandshahr ... 33 Aligarh ... ... 12 Etah 16 Muttra 16 Farukhabad ... 11 Agra 17 Etwah 9 Mainpuri 334 Cawnpore 5 Hamrpur  7 Bnda 2   Carried over 697  District or country.

And this fact is made further plain by a consideration of the numerical abstract received from Etah, which records the existence of 653 cases in that district, distributed as follows :- Names of police circles. Cases of leprosy. Soron ... ... 51 Ksganj ... 75 Sahawar 51 Mrehra 40 Kadirganj  36 Amanpur  35 Patiali  71   Carried over 359   Names of police circles. Cases of leprosy. Brought over 359 Sirpura 47 Etah 73 Nidhauli ... ... 48 Dhauri ... ... 57 Sakt ... ... 23 Aliganj ... ... 46   Total 653  9. On this point, too, I am able to quote the opinion of some medical officers who have, in addition to the history statements, favoured me with concise reports on the subject of leprosy. Dr. Jones, of Sahranpur, is of opinion that leprosy in that dis- trict is pretty equally distributed, and is not due to local causes. Dr. Thomas, of Bnda, states that the disease prevails principally in four widely separated parganas, which have no special peculiarities characteristic of them. Dr. Prentis, of Gorakhpur records the opinion that, although leprosy is rather frequent in that district, it does not occur in one part more than another. Dr. Hooper, of Benares, records the opinion that the disease is not localized in that district.
?10. Yet, to this general rule of extended prevalence, something of exception appears as the result of this investigation, which should be stated here. By careful consideration of the histories provided, it appears that leprosy may be unusually prevalent in some centres of population. There is nothing to show that this is due to local causes ; but so far as this limited enquiry goes, it seems likely that if there are any especial leprosy-producing centres of population in this province, they may be pointed out in the following statement:- District. Greatest number of cases originating in one centre. Name of that centre of population. Garhwl ... 3 Zaml. Kumaun 2 Gar Khera. Tari 7 Kshipur. Bijnor ... 3 Niko-af-al.

It may be observed of the above list that many of the places where the dis- ease appears to arise most frequently are populous cities, and the greatness of the popu- lation may account for the unusual number of cases originating therein, peculiarity of locality having nothing to do with the prevalence. But this line of argument will not account for the undue prevalence of leprosy in a village of small population, as for example in Parsan in Jalaun. It is certainly not impossible that even in the case of a small village, leprosy commencing there may in every case be due to hereditary taint. But as this enquiry proceeds, evidence of a commencement of the disease " de novo" in some individuals will appear, and it seems not unlikely that the conditions under which this untoward circumstance arises, may be profitably studied amongst the lepers of a small village. This I purpose doing when opportunity occurs. In regard to Parsan, I may add that the Civil Surgeon of Jalaun attributes the undue prevalence of leprosy 2
?( 6 ) there to the filthy state of the village, and to general insanitary conditions surrounding the inhabitants. 12. Leprosy, as it appears in this province, seems to be a diseased condition much more prevalent amongst men than women. The census statement is 8,160 male and 1,939 female lepers existing in the pro- vince in 1872-about four males to one female. Of 2,155 cases of which I have the particulars of sex-namely 1,502 in the histories and 653 in the Etah numerical abstract -1,966 are cases of males and 189 cases of females-about 10 males to one female. This latter estimate may be in excess of the truth, because, for the purpose of examina- tion, it is more likely that males would present themselves; yet, taking the case of the two districts-Mainpuri and Etah-with their full record of all existing lepers, I find that, out of 1,125 cases, 1,067 are male, and 58 female-about 18 males to one female. Altogether, there cannot, I think, be a doubt that the male constitution, or the cir- cumstances of male life, are peculiarly favourable to the development of the leprous condition. 13. Of the 2,155 cases above mentioned, 244 are cases of Muhammadans, and 1,911 cases of Hindus-or about eight Hindus to one Muhammadan. As the ratio of popula- tion is rather more than six Hindus to one Muhammadan, this would seem to show a pre- ponderance of Hindu lepers, but not to such extent as to provide ground for the consi- deration of leprosy as specially a disease of Hindus. Bather, I think, for all practical purposes, it may be considered a disease equally of Muhammadans and Hindus. Nor, indeed, are Christians exempt ; for Dr. Fitzgerald, of Shhjahnpur, records three cases of leprosy in Europeans resident in India which have come to his knowledge-one the case of alad, son of a warrant officer at Agra ; the second, the case of a lady ; the third, the case of a Colonel in the Indian service. And amongst the cases reported from Meerut is one of a Native Christian employed in the Mission there, who first suffered from the disease at Mussooree. And, I think, it may be concluded that there is nothing in religion, or habits re- sulting therefrom, conducive to leprosy. 14. In regard to employment, the habits and circumstances arising therefrom, a very complete account is given in the histories, of the employment or means of livelihood of each individual at the time of first attack, and the account carefully sum- marized provides the following results :-   Number. Employment. Number so employed at time of first attack.  Number. Employment. Number so employed At time of first attack. 1 Cultivators  552  Brought over  1,457 2 Labourers  210    3 Bankers, shopkeepers, traders  117 26 Fishermen and boatmen...  9 4 Servants, soldiers, officials  72 27 Shepherds ...  7 5 Supported by relatives (being women or children )  68 28 Lawyers, clerks, brokers  7    29 Dyers ...  5 6 Beggars  65 30 Masons ...  5 7 Weavers  50 31 Goldsmiths  4 8 Landlords  42 32 Chick or basket-makers  4 9 Cowherds  24 33 Prostitutes 4 10 Blacksmiths  23 34 Confectioners  4 11 Carpenters  22 35 Horse or cattle dealers  3 12 Oil-makers  22 36 Butchers  3 13 Potters  20 37 Betel-makers  3 14 Carriers (kahars)  19 38 Wood or bamboo-cutters  3 15 Barbers  19 39 Bangle-makers  2 16 Syces and grass-cutters  17 40 Tile-makers ...  2 17 Tailors  16 41 Dacoit ...  1 18 Sweepers 15 42 Bird-catcher  1 19 Shoe-makers, tanners  15 43 Distiller ...  1 20 Washermen ( dhobis)  14 44 Breeder of fowls ...  1 21 Priests (Brahmans so employed) 12 45 Tinman ...  1 22 Gardeners  12 46 Cutler (sikligar)  1 23 Water-carriers (bhisties)  10 47 Ekka driver ... .. 1 24 Cart-drivers  11 48 Musician  1 25 Grain-parchers or grinders 10 49 Firework-maker  1   Carried over 1,457  Total  1,631
?( 7 ) From this account it appears that the disease is not specially prevalent amongst men of any one form of employment. Indeed, I think it not unlikely the ratios, of cases recorded, to the totals of persons existing in the province of each form of employ- ment mentioned in the list, would, if the figures were available, be found pretty equal. If any undue prevalence were discoverable, it would probably appear amongst the class employed as bankers, shopkeepers, and traders. 15. The same remark applies to castes. The castes of those afflicted with leprosy recorded in the 1,531 histories are rather more numerous than the employments of the above list, and the caste list teaches deci- dedly that caste has no influence on the prevalence of the disease. The caste list and the employment list are, indeed, very much alike in regard to what may be learnt from them, and I have preferred to give the list of employments as more generally understandable and more pertinent to the enquiry on hand. 16. The list of employment points plainly to one fact of importance ; namely, the pretty equal prevalence of leprosy amongst the poor or those who have to struggle for the necessaries of life, and the rich or those who possess the necessaries of life with certainty. Estimating two-thirds of the cultivators as poor, a high ratio, for many were re- turned as farmers, the list of those who may have had to struggle for the necessaries of life will be- Cultivators  368 Labourers  210 Beggars  68 Weavers  50 Potters  20 Sweepers  15 Total 731 Leaving a balance of 800 persons, of whom at least 315-namely, 117 bankers, shopkeepers and traders ; 72 soldiers, servants and officials ; 68 supported by relatives ; 42 landlords; 12 priests ; 4 goldsmiths-must have been living in fairly affluent circum- stances, and the remaining 485 were most likely placed above want of any important character by the practice of their professions or employments. Probably, by the law of ratios it might be shown that leprosy is a disease unduly prevalent amongst those who lead a sedentary life. But the facts of the list suffice to prove that the disease afflicts alike the Cultivator or Labourer of open air life with hard fare, and the Bania or merchant of sedentary habits and ample nourish- ment. 17. The previous list, as the heading shows, provides a statement of employment at the time leprosy first appeared in the individuals concerned. I think it is a point of some importance to determine how these people were employed, or what means of live- lihood they possessed at the time of examination, in most cases, many years after they were first afflicted; and the following statement provides the necessary informa- tion :-
?( 8 )     Number. Employment or means of livelihood. Number so employed at time of examination. Number. Employment or means of livelihood. Number so employed at time of examination.

Indeed, if to the total of 496 beggars, the 80 persons supported by relation or friends, and the three prisoners are added, the ratio of persons dependent on charity will be nearly 38 per cent. of the total afflicted. This deplorable result is to be expected, of course, in a lingering condition of disease which, in its aggravated form, destroys the hands and feet and otherwise renders the sufferer unfit to labour. 18. Yet, the list of persons still able to support themselves is a goodly one, and provides undeniable evidence that so long as a leper can work, there is little or no pre- judice in this country against his employment in his special line of business or profes- sion, and this not in cases so slight as to be easily concealed from the general public. 19. In illustration of these points, I record two typical cases received from Mu- zaffarnagar-one of a man reduced to beggary, the other of a man who supports himself as a grain-seller. " The case of Kesri, 30 years of age, a beggar, was formerly a gardener. The whole body insensible, marks of accidental burns on the left hip and shoulder, felt no pain when burnt. The palms of the hands without fingers, all the toes of the feet drop- ped off and healed, a large ulcer on the ball of the left great toe." " The case of Dewan, aged 45, grain-seller in the bazar: patches of discolouration with annestheisa over the whole body. The right index finger hypertrophied. The fingers of the left hand contracted. Both feet swollen, and a large ulcer over the balls of the toes of the left foot." 20. I could quote many such cases in support of the opinion that lepers do not find themselves denied the means of livelihood while able to work. They may be shunned by their relations and caste people as disgracefully afflicted or unpleasant, but do not apparently lose caste, or find the general public unwilling to buy of them, or employ them, because of their suffering condition. And, when a leper becomes a beggar, it is, as a rule, by reason of his having fallen into a helpless condition as the disease advances. Even leper prostitutes apparently are not debarred from gaining a livelihood by the practice of their calling.
( 9 ) ?21.  I think from these facts it may be gathered that the people of this country, as the result of experience, do not believe in any contagious nature of leprosy. 22. The ages of the 1,531 persons of the histories appear in the following state- ment, and to these I am able to add the ages of 47 lepers recorded in the Agra city nominal roll :- Age at date of examination. Age. Age not stated.  5 to 10 years.  10 to 20 years.  20 to 30 years  30 to 40 years.  40 to 50 years.  50 to 60 years. 60 to 70 years. Above 70 years. Total. Remarks. Number at each  period of age.  3 1 51 213 318 438 332 130 45 1,531  History statements.  1    3 12 14 12 5 47  Agra city roll. Total 4 1 51 213 321 450 346  142 50 1,578  The table shows that 62.6 per cent. of those examined were above 40 years of age, and 12.2 per cent. had lived to be more than 60 years old-a great age for people of this country. Of the 50 persons more than 70 years old, 29 are returned as between 70 and 75, 2 from 75 to 80, 14 from 80 to 85, 3 from 85 to 90, and 2 from 90 to 95. It is likely that these latter figures are in excess of the actual facts. But still the evidence of age, as a whole, goes to prove undoubtedly that to suffer from leprosy does not forbid the expectation of long life. 23. The age at time of first appearance of the complaint is a fact perhaps of greater importance than the age at the time of examination, and the following is the statement, as compiled from the histories recorded and from the nominal roll of 530 lepers of the Agra city and Agra district, in which the age at time of attack is recorded. Age at first appearance of the disease. Age. Age Not stated. At Birth. Under 5 years. 5 to 10 years. 10 to 20 years. 20 to 30 years. 30 to 40 years. 40 to 50 years. Above 50 years. Total. Remarks. Number at each  period of age.  3 5 10 24 232 371 457 285 144 1,531 Histories.    2 10 48 129 154 121 66 530 Agra city and district. Total 3 5 12 34 280 500 611 406 210 2,061  The table shows that 83.8 per cent. of these examined were more than 20 years old, that is, well advanced beyond the age of puberty before the disease attacked them ; and 59.5 per cent. were more than 30 years old, or long past the age of active fertility.  Of the 210 persons of more than 50 years of age previous to attack, 185 were between 50 and 60, 12 between 60 and 70, and 13 between 70 and 80, so that leprosy, it is seen, attacks even the extremely aged. 24. But the important fact to be learnt from this summary is, that, as a rule, the disease does not appear in any recognizable form until after children have been probably born to the person afflicted. If to the ages above 20 I had added the ages from 17 to 20, which are fairly numerous, and at which men and women are often fertile in this country, this fact would have appeared more marked. 3
?(10) 25. In regard to the character of the complaint from which people of this country suffer, the histories mention three varieties. The tubercular, ansthetic, and the mixed tubercular and ansthetic.    I give a typical case of each variety. The tubercular.-"Case of Dhuman, aged 55, formerly a weaver, now a beggar: examined on 31st May, 1875. Both ears long and pendulous, face tuberculated, the skin of the body looks tender and shrivelled. No discolouration or ansthetic spots. All the toes ulcerated, the left little toe dropped off about four months ago: about a year ago had an attack of ulceration of the internal membrane of the nose, wherein mag- gots generated, and now there is a large hole over the left side of the nose. Has suf- fered for 10 years." The ansthetic.-"Case of Dhalip, aged 50, employed as a cultivator. Itching sensation all over the body at times, pains in all large joints, sensation of heat at the soles of the feet and palms of the hands and chest. Has profuse perspirations of a greasy nature. The right hip and dorsum of the right hand quite benumbed. Both feet swollen.    Has suffered for two years." The case of Kesri given in a previous paragraph illustrates the appearances which may be expected after lengthened suffering from this form of the disease. Kesri had suffered for 20 years. The mixed.-"Case of Nathwa, aged 30, employed as a sweeper: examined on 10th June, 1875. The disease commenced five years ago by the appearance of small red patches over the left scapula, insensible to the touch, and free from itching. Now the face is lobulated, there are large pinkish elevated ansthetic blotches over the chest, the lobes of the ears are lobular, the skin of the extremities is corrugated and shining, and of a dark pink hue. Both nipples are hypertrophied. Has an ulcer, co- vered with a hard crust, on the right great toe, caused by the rubbing of a new shoe." 26.    In the 1,531 history cases, these varieties number  as follows:-tubercular 791, ansthetic 640, mixed 64, character not stated 36. But I have reason to think the varieties are not correctly stated in the Mainpuri police return, and, excluding the 472 cases reported from that district, the remaining 1,059 cases are distributable as follows:-ansthetic 516, tubercular 443, mixed 64, character not stated 36. Altogether, I think it may be concluded the ansthetic is the most common form of the complaint, the tubercular less common, the mixed form comparatively rare. 27.    Of the 1,531 persons included in the history statements, 278 had never been married, and were consequently childless: by far the greatest number of these unmar- ried lepers being, indeed, children and persons of less than 20 years of age. To the remaining 1,253 persons, as many as 3,535 children had been born, of whom 1,951 were living at the time of examination. The resulting average is 2.8 children born to each leper, and 1.5 living. In respect to this point, the information received from Mainpuri is imperfect, if not very incorrect. Eliminating the figures referring to that district, the account stands for the remaining districts-3.5 children born to each leper, and 1.7 living. That is the average for each leper, male and female, of the list. A very consider- able number of the married lepers were childless, but by far the greater majority had been parents to fairly large families, and as many as 282 of the persons examined had had families ranging in number from 5 to 18 children. I think the evidence is conclusive that lepers are as prolific as mankind in general.
?(11) 28. The periods of cohabitation, after the disease appeared, between man and wife in the case of the 1,253 married lepers, or lepers who had been married, are divisible as follows :-    1 2 3       4  5       6                       Period  Less than  From 6        For              Separated at time of attack,     Total.                                           not staled.  6 months.   months to 5     more than 5      or husband or wife dead                                                                                     years.                  years.                 previous to attack. Number of persons ...  63 30 308         517  335       1,253 The table provides, in columns 2, 3, and 4, a total of 855 cases in which cohabita- tion continued after the disease appeared in either husband or wife. Of these 855 cases, the histories expressly state, that in 831 the disease was not communicated to the healthy husband or wife, and that in 24 cases both husband and wife were lepers, or became lepers. 29. As this favours in some measure an opinion of the contagious nature of the disease, it is necessary to record the exact circumstances in regard to these 24 cases. In 13 of them, I find that both husband and wife were acknowledged lepers at the time of marriage; twelve of these cases of leper marriages having occurred in the Almora Leper Asylum as part apparently of the system in force there. Of the remaining 11 cases, the following is a detailed account, so far as it can be rendered from the records provided :- No. 1.-The case of Nachal, 40 years of age, a sweeper, who married a woman who had leprosy, and at the age of 24 became himself a leper. No one of his own family had suffered from leprosy. No. 2.-The case of Mirwa, aged 45, a Muhammadan weaver. His father and elder sister were lepers, and he himself became a leper at 30 years of age. His wife continued to live with him, and eventually suffered from leprosy. No. 3.-The case of Dhuman, aged 55, a Hindu weaver. Has no recollection as to the previous occurrence of leprosy in his own family. Became a leper at 45. His wife continued to live with him, and suffered from leprosy. No. 4.-The case of Dhalip, aged 50, a cultivator. No one of his own family had been a leper. Became a leper at 48, and his wife was affected with the same complaint one year afterwards. No. 5.-The case of Gauri Shankar, aged 36, Rajput. His elder brother was a leper, and he himself became a leper at 32. His wife lived with him for two years afterwards, and was affected with leprosy. No. 6.-The case of Sitabu, aged 40, a Muhammadan woman. Her grandfather and father were lepers, and she became a leper at 28. Her husband lived with her for one year after she was affected, and he suffered from leprosy. No. 7.-The case of Bishn, aged 45, cultivator.    His grandfather was a leper. His wife became a leper and died. Afterwards, at the age of 43, he himself was attacked with leprosy. No. 8.-The case of Mani, aged 28, a sweeper.    No blood relation affected, Became a leper at 18, and afterwards his wife was affected with leprosy. No. 9.-The case of Mli, aged 60, a cultivator. No member of his family pre- viously affected. Became a leper at 40.  His wife continued to live with him, and was affected, but whether before or after the husband is not stated. No. 10.-The case of Sobah, aged 50, a cultivator.    No blood relation had been a leper. His wife's father died of leprosy. His wife was attacked with leprosy in 1870. and he became a leper in 1871, at the age of 46.
?(12) No. 11.-The case of Ramphal, aged 60, a Brahman landlord. His uncle was a leper. His wife became a leper when he was 38 years old, they continued to live together, and he himself became a leper at 50. 30. It may be seen that in cases Nos. 7 and 11, there is evidence of hereditary taint sufficient to account for the appearance of the disease, although the wife had not been affected. In No. 1 a young man deliberately married a leper woman, and became himself a leper at the early ago of 24. It seems at least likely that the man had reason to think he himself was not free from hereditary taint, although he states to the contrary. In No. 6 a man marries a woman whoso grandfather and father had been lepers. In No. 10 a man marries a woman whose father had died of leprosy. I think the same remark applies to these cases. In No. 2 a woman marries a man whoso father and elder sister had been lepers. The same remark is applicable, although perhaps less forcibly than in the case of a man who marries a woman of notoriously leper family. In No. 5 a woman marries a man whose elder brother was a leper. Of the four remaining cases Nos. 3, 4, 8, and 9. In No. 8 the early age at which the man was affected, at 18, points forcibly to hereditary taint. Altogether I think the conclusion probably well founded, that at least the majority of these cases in which both husband and wife suffered were cases of intermarriages between members of leprous families, the hereditary taint existing both in husband and wife. 31- But, granting that this conclusion may not be warrantable, still the fact re- mains that of 855 cases of cohabitation, than which no closer form of human inter- course can be imagined, only 11 or 1.3 per cent, are discoverable, in which suspicion of the communication of the disease from the husband to the wife, or from the wife to the husband, arises. Gauged by this test, the probability of any contagious origin of leprosy, arising out of the ordinary intercourse of lepers with the general public, becomes infinitesimal. A view, farther strengthened by the fact, that in some cases of the 855 above mentioned, it is recorded that a leprous husband had married two or three wives, who cohabited with him without in any such instance any wife being affected with leprosy. 32.    Yet, although infinitesimal, it cannot be declared non-existent, as viewed by the light thrown on this point in the histories under consideration.    For in addition to the perhaps  doubtful cases recorded above,  one leper at  Cawnpore attributed the disease to contagion, in that he had lived next door   to a shopkeeper who was a leper. And, most important of all, Dr. Fitzgerald records the case of a Colonel in the Indian Service, who some years ago became a leper, and could account for his misfortune  only by the fact that he had continued to  cohabit with a native woman after she had been attacked with leprosy. 33.    In regard to hereditary taint as a cause of the disease, the histories contain valuable evidence which may be classified as follows :-     Relationships.         Grandfather or grandmo-ther. Father or mo-ther. Uncle or aunt. Brother or sister. Cousin. Father-in-law or mother-in-law. Not stated. No relation af-fected or "does not know." Total. Number of lepers who acknowledged   that such of their relations suffered from leprosy. 19 173 46 61 5 7 26 1,194 1,531
?(13) Deducting the seven persons who stated that their wife's father or mother only had suffered from leprosy, the first five columns of the account provide a total of 304 persons who stated that their blood relations had suffered from the disease within their knowledge, or nearly one in five (19.8 per cent.) of the lepers examined. Several of these 304 persons acknowledged that their blood relations for two or three generations back had suffered, and in such cases, only the fact as regards the nearest blood relation of those affected was entered in the statement. It will be noticed how large a proportion of those who acknowledged to hereditary taint stated that either father or mother had been affected. This was to be expected of persons of limited or blunted intellect, such as the majority of lepers are, for they would be likely to know or remember little of any relation far removed or not living within their own sphere of observation.  Nineteen persons stated that only their grand-parents had suffered, which points to the fact that  leprosy may descend to the grand-children without visibly affecting the intermediate generation. If this is so, it may not be unlikely that many of the 1,194 persons who stated their want of knowledge in regard to hereditary taint, or absolutely denied its existence as part of the history of their own cases, may have had leprous grandfathers or other relations of previous generations of whom they know nothing. Some I think were likely to deny the fact of such taint, if they knew of it, from shame or disinclination to record any words of memory disrespectful to their departed forefathers. 34.    This idea of, in reality, a larger average of cases of hereditary taint than the histories disclose, is upheld by the statements of some  of the Civil  Surgeons who recorded the facts on which this investigation rests. The Civil Assistant Surgeon of Tari district states, with regard to 19 cases in which lepers examined there answered "No" to the question of hereditary taint, that he should be inclined to put down "unknown" as more nearly expressing their meaning. Doctor Wood, Civil Surgeon of Bijnor, is of opinion that many of the lepers exa- mined by him, who denied any hereditary taint, were none the less subject to it. Doctor Jones of Sahranpur is of opinion that leprosy is as much hereditary as tuberculosis, and he has no doubt that the families of a much larger number of lepers than those who acknowledged it in his histories (18 out of 60) have been afflicted with leprosy, for there exists a great unwillingness on the part of lepers to confess that their families have been affected. Doctor Fitzgerald of Shhjahnpur is of opinion that leper parents will almost always beget leper children. Doctor Thomas of Bnda records the opinion of the Tahsldar of Sehond, to the effect that leprosy is invariably hereditary (confined to certain families) in that pargana. Doctor Hatchell of Jaunpur, where of 30 lepers, 28 denied all knowledge of here- ditary taint, is of opinion that no reliance can be placed on the information given under the head   "family history." 35.    In further proof of the probability that in these 1,531 histories the number of cases connected with hereditary taint is under-stated, I should mention that of 60 cases reported by Doctor Hooper, from the Benares Leper Asylum, 33 of the persons examined acknowledged hereditary taint in the following relationships-6, the grand- father or grandmother; 9, the father or mother; 11, the uncle or aunt; 4, the brother or sister; 3 the cousin. 4
?(14) I think it probable that lepers living in an asylum, and, from experience, less likely to fear or suspect the object of examination would be inclined to tell all they know. The result here gives rather more than 50 per cent. of the whole as cases connected with hereditary taint, and perhaps that may be accepted as near the truth in regard to this matter, so far as it can be determined by the testimony of living lepers. 36.    But, viewed in any form, the testimony as disclosed in these histories is sufficient to prove that hereditary taint, unlike contagion, must be a potent cause of the continuation or prevalence of leprosy amongst the people of this country, perhaps the most potent of any cause in existence. 37.    That there may be another cause, or other causes, cannot however be denied. The testimony in this direction is plain, and often repeated in the histories and the papers which accompanied them. And it seems certain that the cause or causes which first originated this form of disease are still in existence, and may originate the com- plaint in a man to whose history no suspicion of hereditary taint attaches. It cannot, I think, be possible that all the 1,194 persons, who denied hereditary influence, could have been mistaken: indeed, a few of them were very explicit in deny- ing the existence of any such influence, sometimes to their knowledge for three genera- tions back. 38.    What these originating causes may be cannot in the present state of our knowledge be more than guessed at.    They appear to be first and principally such climatic conditions, habits, or mode of life, as conduce to the formation of constitutions in middle life prone to low forms of disease. In a person thus predisposed, it seems probable that a previous attack of syphilitic disease may result in the establishment of a condition of leprosy. Thus of 63 lepers examined at Sahranpur, 18, who denied hereditary taint, attri- buted their leprous condition to syphilis. And Doctor Jones records the opinion that syphilis is an important initiating cause in the comparatively few cases of leprosy generated anew. At Muzaffarnagar four persons of those examined attributed their leprosy to the results of venereal disease. Doctor Fitzgerald of Shhjahnpur is of opinion that syphilis may have some con- nection with the occurrence of leprosy. Seven of the 30 persons examined there had had syphilis before the leprosy made its appearance, and two had suffered from gonor- rhea; and from enquiries made by Dr. Fitzgerald of intelligent natives, he found the belief prevailing amongst them, that leprosy is sometimes developed where syphilis has been injudiciously treated with mercury. 39.    That leprosy may be   developed "de novo" in persons against whom no sus- picion of hereditary taint rests, seems to be most satisfactorily proved by the histories of two cases recorded by  Doctor Fitzgerald.    The first, the case of an European lad who had become a leper, although there was no trace or suspicion of taint on the father's or mother's side, direct or remote. The young man was first seen at Agra in 1865,   and again seven years afterwards at Bombay, where he had gone to be treated by Dr. Bhau Dhajee, who had acquired a widespread reputation for the cure of leprosy. But in this case the treatment pursued had not been attended with benefit or  promise of improve- ment.    The second, the case of an European lady, who left India in 1875 and suffered with   symptoms of leprosy after her arrival in England.    No suspicion of hereditary taint existed. 40.    But the further consideration of this  important  point must  be  postponed until, as mentioned in para, 10, I have had opportunity for carefully recording the his-
?(15) tory and circumstances of all the lepers of a village in which the disease is unusually prevalent. And for this purpose I have it in mind to reside for some days, during the approaching cold season, in the immediate neighbourhood of certain centres of popula- tion thus notorious. The results of this local investigation will form the subject of a second communi- cation to Government on this important matter. 41. The conclusions which may I think be fairly arrived at, as the results of this present investigation, can be stated as follows:- Leprosy in the North-Western Provinces is a disease so widely spread as to be known in all parts, but best known in Kumaun, Garhwl, Bnda, and probably Gorakh- pur. Yet, everywhere, the places where first attacks occur are so scattered over the face of the country, as to almost preclude the idea that local conditions have any in- fluence as a cause of the disease. This point however remain for further considera- tion. It is a disease specially of men as distinguished from women. A disease not pecu- liar to persons of any employment or religion, with the possible exception that persons of sedentary habits are prone to suffer. Leprosy affects in about equal proportions the well-to-do and the poor. It results, however, in reducing to beggary at least one-third of those attacked, though so long as labour is possible lepers are not debar- red, by public opinion concerning them, from earning a livelihood as before their attack. This reduction to beggary being much helped by the fact that the ansthe- tic variety, which leads most surely to mutilations of the hands and feet, is most pre- valent. As a rule leprosy assumes outward and hurtful appearance at the ages from 20 to 50 years, or after children have been born to those afflicted,-lepers, or those who are to suffer leprosy, being as prolific as mankind in general, and living as long. Its attack results so little from contagion, that only about 1 per cent. of 855 cases of cohabitation between a leprous husband and healthy wife, or leprous wife and healthy husband, resulted in showing leprosy of both husband and wife. This low average even being possibly reducible, upon the well-founded supposition that the cases of leprosy of both husband and wife may in some instances have arisen from intermarriage of a man and woman in both of whom leprosy was hereditary. Leprosy is essentially a hereditary disease, as shown by the testimony of about 20 per cent. of persons examined, and probably in far greater proportion of all those afflicted in the Province, if the truth could be arrived at. But in addition to the few cases which may result from contagion, and the many which result from hereditary influence, there seem undoubtedly to be cases which arise in persons remote from contagion and of healthy families, the circumstances of these "do novo" cases requiring further study and consideration. 41. I think the practical value of this investigation may be summed up in the statements,-1st, that lepers of all suffering mankind are most worthy of compassionate consideration, at least such of them as, by mutilation, are reduced to beggary. For it is certain that a large proportion of these suffering men (and men have less expectation of help from relations than women) have fallen into misery and poverty, without shadow of self-fault or misbehaviour. The evil was born with then, therefore they suffer yet linger in life. For this reason they are worthy objects of charity, and are properly cared for in good numbers in the Leper Asylums which exist in several places in the Province.    Yet, from the nnmber
of helpless lepers who may be found begging in public throughout the Province, it seems probable that the asylum accommodation is insufficient, or the asylum manage- ment disagreeable. And, 2nd, that any measure of sequestration of lepers, with a view to the eradication of the disease, such as I understand is in force in Norway, is not likely to attain its objects here, seeing that in the great majority of cases the disease, has been trans- mitted to the coming generation before any accurate knowledge of its existence in men now living can be attained to. For I do not suppose it possible to sequestrate an apparently heathly man because his grandfather or father had been lepers. SANITARY COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE, N.-W. P. :                    C.
