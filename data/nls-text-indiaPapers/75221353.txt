ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR 1911-12 Muktesar Laboratories [NLS note: poor quality text appears here and has been omitted Annual Report of the Imperial Bacteriologist MUKTESAR LABORATORIES For the year 1911-12. 1. I remained in charge of the Laboratory throughout the year. Mr. Cross and Dr. Hartley held their respective charges of Assistant Bacteriologist and Physiological Chemist. 2. The three European Laboratory Assistants held their respective appointments during the year. Towards the close of the year (8th March, 1912) Mr. Kriebel was granted six months' combined leave to Europe and an Assistant was appointed temporarily to relieve the other Laboratory Assistants. PREPARATION OF SERA. 3. Rinderpest anti-serum.2 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The issue amounted to 6,98,100 doses as compared with 5,33,779 doses during the year 1910-11. After complying with each indent in full, there was a large surplus of this serum at the close of the official year. 4. The large output of serum during the year under report is due to the introduction into routine practice at Muktesar of the new method of anti-serum preparation investigated at Bareilly during the winter months of 1910-11. The application of this new method has given very successful results. The average annual output of this serum has been doubled without any increase of cost and with a less expenditure of animals. The new method has the further advantage that Plains cattle and buffaloes can be extensively utilised in the production of serum. The supply of serum no longer depends on a sufficient supply of susceptible Hill bulls, and consequently the necessity of establishing a second Laboratory for anti-Rinderpest serum preparation has been obviated. The method is being further improved and worked and very large quantities of this serum can be prepared if required. 5. The following two reports on the subject of the new methods introduced in the preparation of Rinderpest anti-serum have been submitted to the Government of India :FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. 3 instruction at the Laboratory in the methods of serum therapy with a view of further extending the serum and virus simultaneous method of conferring immunity against Rinderpest. This method has been successfully practised among the cattle in the Military Dairies by Captain Cochrane. A report on the result of his work was published in the Journal of Tropical Veterinary Science, No. 2, Volume VI. 7. It is satisfactory to note that although a charge of two annas per dose has been imposed for this serum on Local Governments and Bodies only, by the order of the Government of India Revenue and Agriculture Depart- ment circular letter No. 164 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 9. The results of anti-serum injections carried out in the field and collated from the respective returns received in this office are noted below :FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. 5 10. The year under report was rather exceptionally free from foot and mouth disease. Out of 2,015 Hill bulls received only 73 animals were found affected with foot and mouth disease during the months of April and May, 1911. The following is a statement of Hill bulls received with a record of their condition :6 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 14.

Captain W. A. Wood, A.V.C., Rawalpindi, worked at the Laboratory from the 14th May, 1911 to 25th August, 1911. RESEARCH. 25. The Programme of Research Work for the year 1911-12 consisted of the following :10 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST At Bareilly, Lieutenant O'Kelly, A.V.C., treated with success some Surra infected mules belonging to the Transport Corps. A large number of experiments on the treatment of Surra in horses and dogs by means of Salvarsan were carried out which resulted in a small number of cures. A paper giving full details of the experiments has been completed for publication. 29. Rinderpest.FOR THE YEAR 1911-12. 11 is increasing every year and the source of supply one of the compartments of the Muktesar Reserved Forest the yield of which is regulated by the working plan.

Annual Report of the Imperial Bacteriologist For the year 1912-13. ADMINISTRATION. I remained in charge of the Laboratory throughout the year. From 1st October 1912 to 30th March 1913 my services were placed at the disposal of the Commission sent from England to investigate certain questions connected with Foot and Mouth disease. Much of my time between these dates was occupied in this work. 2. The charge of the office of the Assistant Bacteriologist was held by Mr. Cross from 1st April to 11th of June 1912. He was absent on six months' leave out of India and rejoined his work on the 11th December 1912. During the interval I carried out his duties in addition to my own. By the middle of January Mr. Cross was transferred to Sohawa as Camel Specialist, and Mr. Meadows acted as Assistant Bacteriologist from 14th January 1913. 3. Dr. Hartley held the appointment of Physiological Chemist till 18th of February 1913, when he resigned. Since that time the post has been vacant. B

This serum was tested by the Egyptian Government on their cattle with satisfactory results, and the Laboratory has been requested to supply that Government with a large amount of serum. The demand of Rinderpest serum increases each year, and by the erection of a Laboratory at Bareilly, to include serum preparation, provision is being made to meet all demands. Dr. Hartley's resignation is to be regretted, but it is expected that a suitable staff of well-trained officers will be appointed during the present year. The work of the Labora- tory has reached proportions greater than the present small staff can continue to cope with. J. D. E. HOLMES, Major, Imperial Bacteriologist.

Fodder Supply.FOR THE YEAR 1913-14 3 10. Electric Centrifuges.4 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The work in connection with the removal of the Labora- tory to its new site is progressing favourably. The land has been acquired and a special officer of the Public Works Department is in charge of the new buildings. Plans and estimates for these are in the course of preparation. When the branch Laboratory is completed, it is hoped that the increasing demand for rinderpest serum will be easily supplied. Government has sanctioned an additional staff of dressers, packers and other menials to carry on the serum preparation work at Bareilly during the winter months. II.-PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. 13. Rinderpest Anti-Serum.FOR THE YEAR 1913-14 5 14. The following figures, as collated from the respective returns received, show the results of Anti-Rinderpest serum injections carried out in the field:6 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The following extract from the Report by the Chief Veterinary Officer to the Egyptian Government on cattle plague and double inoculation is interesting, as during 1913 they used about 1¼ lac doses of serum prepared at this Labor- atory. "From the 16th October until 31st December 1913, 21,849 cattle were injected with virulent blood and serum. The mortality was 566 or 2.59 per cent." "Of the above number 3,987 cattle were inoculated on nine different dates with 262 deaths or 6.57 per cent. due largely to Piroplasmosis (Texas and Egyptian fevers) follow- ing double inoculation. 17,862 cattle were inoculated on other dates with 304 deaths or 1.7 per cent." "In addition to Texas fever causing losses, the cold weather and the absolute negligence of the owners of cattle have largely assisted." "The total number of cattle immunised since the double inoculation commenced up to 31st December 1913 is 167,007 in the cotton districts and 18,020 in the non-cotton districts, making a total of 185,027." " In addition 763 cattle were inoculated, but the final results have not yet been received." " The total number of deaths up to 31st December 1913. including outbreaks, is 1,989, showing a percentage of 1.07." " The number of non-inoculated cattle reported as having died from natural infection of cattle plague during the year 1913 was 1,824 which, added to 1,916 deaths following double inoculation during the same year, makes a total of 3,740 against 5,445 deaths from cattle plague during the year 1912." "On the 16th December 1913, a further 100 cattle of the State Domains, doubly inoculated on 27th June 1912, of which 39 reacted, were injected with virulent blood, and kept under observation for 15 days. No cases of cattle plague followed nor any cattle plague reaction. It is
FOR THE YEAR 1913-14 7 therefore assumed that double inoculation has conferred immunity for a period of not less than 18½ months." "From a long experience I came to the conclusion that serum could not be considered an efficient means for stamping out cattle plague; it acted frequently as a temporary check and prevented for the time being the disease extending; serumised cattle were allowed to continue their work, which is of the greatest importance at certain seasons of the year." "Further a large number of cattle having had serum are attacked by cattle plague in a mild form, recover and are hence immunised, a very important factor in dealing with the disease and which has assisted in immunising during recent years, a large number of cattle." 15. Anthrax Anti-Serum.8 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 17. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.FOR THE YEAR 1913-14 9 140 animals were inoculated at the villages and 127 on the Farm. The result was excellent, there being no deaths after the serum inoculation, and both outbreaks subsided at once. The information may interest you, as the serum has not been used in these provinces before." 19. Charbon Symptomatique Vaccine.10 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 23. Strangles Serum.-13,577 doses of Strangles serum were manufactured and 12,192 issued during the year under report, against 2,470 prepared and 2,320 issued during the preceding year. Almost all the serum was issued to the Remount Depôts. The Veterinary Officers employed it chiefly as a curative agent and report good results following its use. The Veterinary Officer, Sargodha Remount Depôt, in a demi-official letter, dated 25th April 1914, reports the following:FOR THE YEAR 1913-14 11 (3) Anthrax.-To continue investigations of methods of immunizing against this disease.

The amount of anti-Rinder- pest serum manufactured during the year fell short of that of the previous year by less than one lac of doses. The demand for this serum was very large and could not be complied with in full. The order for Rinderpest serum from Egypt and the Soudan and the enquiry for serum from Rhodesia had to be rejected. If the centrifuges had not broken down the manufacture of serum would have been almost double the amount prepared by the clotting method. The amount of Anthrax, Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia and Strangles serum prepared and issued during the year was in excess of previous years. The amount of Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia vaccine pre- pared and issued was much in excess of any previous year. The fact that the post of Physiological Chemist was vacant and the post of Assistant Bacteriologist held by an officer untrained in scientific work increased the work and responsibility of myself and the European Laboratory Assistants. The serum preparation of the Laboratory was heavier than usual owing to the difficulties of clotting large amounts of blood. A considerable amount of useful research work was carried out, and several articles from the Laboratory were submitted for publication during this year. I wish to record my thanks to the staff for their zeal and co-operation in all the work of the Laboratory. J. D. E. HOLMES, Major, Imperial Bacteriologist.

Annual Report of the Imperial Bacteriologist For the year ending the 31st March 1915. I.-ADMINISTRATION. The late Lieutenant-Colonel J. D. E. Holmes held charge of the Laboratory up to the end of February 1915, when he died suddenly at Bareilly on the afternoon of the 28th of that month. By his untimely death this Laboratory suffered a great loss. During the seven years of his appointment as Im- perial Bacteriologist his research work was of the greatest value to the country and he very largely enhanced the out- put of sera and vaccines for the various diseases of equines and bovines. 2. I held the office of Assistant Bacteriologist throughout the year, but since 1st March 1915, in addition to my own duties, I have also been holding charge of the current duties of the office of the Imperial Bacteriologist. 3. Dr. G. H. K. Macalister, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., was ap- pointed by the Secretary of State for India to the newly sanc- tioned post of Pathologist and reported his arrival in India on the 2nd October 1914.
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The vacant post of Physiological Chemist was filled by the appointment of Dr. R. V. Norris, M.Sc., A.I.C., D.Sc., who reported his arrival on the 27th November 1914. 4. The services of Mr. Kriebel, as Head Laboratory Assistant, were terminated on 29th September 1914, the date of his removal to Ahmednagar as a Prisoner of War. Messrs. Keiller and Goffi were given the designations of Head and 2nd Laboratory Assistants respectively. Mr. Mobbs, the temporary European Laboratory Assistant, was confirmed as 3rd Laboratory Assistant. Mr. Keiller returned from leave and joined his duties on the 1st Septem- ber 1914 ; Mr. Goffi and Mr. Mobbs were on duty throughout the year. 5. On the reversion of Lieutenant W. J. N. Cheatle to Military duty, the post of Farm Manager remained vacant from 25th September to 16th December 1914, on the latter date Mr. E. J. Hooper joined the appointment. 6. Mr. Berkley resigned his post on 1st September 1914 and Mr. T. Morgan, the present Electrician, was appointed in his place on 26th September 1914. 7. Mr. D'Monte, Veterinary Deputy Superintendent, was granted medical leave with effect from 16th October 1914 and has not yet been able to return to duty ; consequently Khan Sahib Wazir Mohamed, Senior Veterinary Inspector, was recalled from furlough and resumed duty on the 28th October 1914. The other three Veterinary Inspectors remained in their respective appointments throughout the year. 8. Fodder supply.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1915 3 9. Forests.4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST five months during the winter season. The usual work of training Military Dairy Farm Managers and research on Kumri and other diseases were carried out. The late Imperial Bacteriologist conducted a series of experiments on Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia as to the possibility of immunising animals by drenching them with cultures of the organism. A number of mules belonging to the Mule Transport Corps were treated successfully for Surra by means of Arsenic compounds. During the past year the work of constructing the resi- dential quarters on the new site of the Branch Laboratory progressed satisfactorily. The plans and estimates of the sheds, outkraals and main Laboratory buildings have been forwarded to Government. It is hoped that these construc- tions and the remaining buildings will be completed during the next year so that by the following winter the preparation of rinderpest serum may be commenced at Bareilly and the present pressure on the Muktesar Laboratory relieved. II. PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. 14. Rinderpest Anti-Serum.FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1915. 5 The large decrease in 1913-14 was entirely due to the breakdown of the electric centrifuges, making it impossible to comply in full with the orders received from India alone, while orders from the Egyptian and Rhodesian Governments could not be considered at all. The issue of 1912-13, viz., 1,128,500 doses includes 198,730 doses supplied to the Egpytian Government while during the past year, of the 1,382,050 doses issued only 48,300 were sent to foreign countries. It will be seen, therefore, that the demand for serum in India is increasing very rapidly and since the present staff, accommodation and facilities at Muktesar are already taxed to their fullest capacity, the need for further expansion to meet the growing demands of the country is very evident. The Egyptian Government cancelled the balance of their outstanding order for Anti-Rinderpest serum in July 1914 after having received 42,000 doses. 15. The net amount to be realized from the sale of Anti- Rinderpest serum for the past year amounts to Rs. 1,54,883* and by adding to this the cost of 77,950 doses supplied free to the Military Department the total revenue from this source alone would come to Rs. 1,64,627. 16. The results of Anti-Rinderpest serum injections carried out in the field and as collated from the respective * A number of the bills amounting to Rs. 43,850-10-0 are still awaiting payment and have to be carried over to next year's account.

The results obtained in the field from inoculations with Anthrax serum are as follows :8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST It would be interesting to know what factors have in- fluenced the relative demands for serum and vaccine in this disease causing an increase in one case and a decrease in the other, but unfortunately no information is at present available on the point. Serum possesses the advantage of giving an immediate im- munity but of short duration while the dose is fairly large ; on the other hand with vaccine some three or four days elapse after injection before immunity is established, but this lasts longer than is the case with serum and the dose to be injected is small (5 to 10 c. c.). 20. The results of inoculations in the field with Hæmorr- hagic Septicæmia serum and vaccine are given in the subjoined table:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1915. 9 21.

This question being of importance in connection with the immunisation of cattle by the simul- taneous method, the observations are being continued and a note will be submitted for publication shortly. (c) The length of time that sera will retain their protective values is a point of great importance and one on which frequent enquiries are received. Lingard showed that prolonged exposure of Anti-Rinderpest serum in the Plains at shade temperatures ranging up to 126° F. caused a loss of 40 to 66 per cent of its protective value. On the other hand Holmes demonstrated that short exposure to temperatures up to 140° F. did not lessen the value of the serum. At temperatures below 90° F. Anti-Rinderpest serum will remain potent for at least two years14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST curative agent could be found. The following compounds were tested :FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1915. 15 the experiments demonstrated that when the cattle were in poor condition the risk of giving them a fatal attack of the disease by this means was considerable, so that the practical application of this method in India cannot be suggested. 32. Surra.16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST year exceeded by 387,115 doses, the highest figure for any previous year, namely, 1,235,401 doses in 1912-13. This result was only achieved by working all departments at high pressure throughout the year, and, in view of the several changes in the staff and many difficulties that have been encountered, is evidence of the zeal and energy of all responsible. Reference has already been made to the centrifuge and water difficulties ; in addition, the war caused a delay of several months in the delivery of our annual supply of glassware for carrying on the routine work of the Labo- ratory, while the additional supply of bottles for the issue of our products, ordered in August 1914, have not yet been despatched from England. These delays have occasioned great inconvenience as the rapid increase in the demand for serum and Mallein caused a larger consumption of glassware than had been anticipated. During the greater part of the year Foot and Mouth disease was exceedingly prevalent in the Kumaun Division, so that most of the Hill bulls and buffaloes reaching Muktesar were either suffering from this disease or developed it soon after arrival. By strict isolation and supervision the infection was confined to the segregation areas and outkraals, and the disorganisation that would have been caused by its spread to the serum-making animals was fortunately prevented. The greater part of my own time has been occupied by the control of the increasing routine work of the Laboratory, to which, since Col. Holmes' death, has been added the duties of administration and responsibilities connected with the drawing up of specifications and requirements for the new Laboratory at Bareilly. The opportunities for research work have therefore been limited ; several observations of

Hooper up to the 15th February 1916 from which date he was granted one month's privilege leave. On the expiration of this leave his services at the Laboratory terminated. Mr. Goffi, the 2nd European Laboratory Assistant, has been discharging the duties of Farm Manager, in addition to his own, with effect from the 16th February 1916.
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 6. Mr. T. Morgan held the post of Electrician up to the 11th December 1915 ; he then joined the Motor Transport Service. Mr. N. N. Ghose, the Assistant Electrician, held charge of the office of Electrician, in addition to his own duties, from the 12th December 1915 to the 22nd February 1916, on which date he was relieved by Mr. W. A. Noel. Mr. Noel has since been relieved by Mr. S. E. Andrews, whose appointment, as Engineer at this Laboratory has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State. 7. Consequent on the death of Mr. D'Monte, Veterinary Deputy Superintendent, on the 12th July 1915, Veterinary Inspector Mr. J. D'Costa was appointed Veterinary Deputy Superintendent, with effect from the 13th July 1915. The post of a Veterinary Inspector rendered vacant by Mr. D'Costa's promotion was not filled up until the 24th November 1915, on which date Mr. J. R. Bhide, a graduate from Bombay Veterinary College, was appointed. The other three Veterinary Inspectors remained in their respective appointments throughout the year. The new post of Veterinary Deputy Superintendent for the inoculation of cattle in the Military Dairies sanctioned in Government of India, Army Department No. 23640-1- (Q.M.G. 9), dated the 13th January 1916, has not yet been filled, but arrangements are being made for the early ap- pointment of a qualified officer to this post. 8. Fodder Supply. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining an adequate supply of hay during the winter months owing to reliance having to be placed on local con- tractors. Poor crops and shortage of labour appear to have produced this position outside Muktesar, while the over- growth of our own forest has led to a large decrease in the production of grass within our boundary. Ultimately an
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 3 amount was delivered which with care will meet our require- ments until next autumn, but the need has been demon- strated of further supplementing our present sources of supply. With this object steps have been taken to cultivate certain areas within the estate and already a considerable amount of ground has been reclaimed and ploughed ready for sowing with English clovers and grasses ; by this means it is hoped to provide a certain quantity of green fodder for our animals. Satisfactory arrangements were made for the supply of grain. 9. Forests. A large quantity of dry and fallen wood was extracted from these areas in addition to the fuel obtained from the coupe of the year. The contractor of the District Forests also supplied the balance of ten thousand maunds of fuel contracted for during the last official year. As the result of an interview which I had with the Inspector General of Forests, at Naini Tal in June 1915, the Forest Department have decided to prepare a new Working Plan for the Muktesar forest, under which they expect to be able to provide at least 20,000 maunds of fuel annually instead of 10,000 maunds as under the old working plan ; this would obviate the necessity of obtaining fuel from the District Forests in future. 10. Water Supply. With our present inadequate arrange- ments the question of water supply becomes more difficult each year. The shortage is greatest during the three months preceding the break of the monsoon, and for the whole of that time the work of the Laboratory is carried on under great difficulties, as most of the water has to be carried by hand and pack ponies from a considerable distance. A new electrically driven pump was erected early in the year, but the discharge from the spring proved quite in- sufficient. The Public Works Department now consider that the hydram scheme is impracticable and propose substituting
4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST electrical pumping from a point some 1,200 feet below the level of the Laboratory. 11. Electric Centrifuges. Some of the old condemned centrifuges have been kept running throughout the year by constant attention and repair, but the risk has been consider- able ; at the close of the year under report three only re- mained in workable condition but none are likely to last very long. Three of the new centrifuges have been delivered and are now awaiting erection. 12. Supply of Hill bulls and Plains animals. There was no change in the arrangements for obtaining hill bulls and plains animals, nor was any difficulty experienced in procur- ing them. 13. Bareilly Branch Laboratory. As usual the Branch Laboratory remained open for about five months during the winter season. In addition to the routine work of testing sera and vaccines, examination of specimens, etc., investigations were carried out in connection with Blackquarter, Anthrax, Strangles, and Tuberculosis of cattle. During September 1915, the Imperial Pathological En- tomologist deputed one of his subordinates to collect biting flies at Kathgodam and with his help up to the end of December, a series of experiments were conducted on the transmission of surra by certain of these flies. Work on the construction of the new branch laboratory at Izatnagar has been delayed owing to the total cost of the project having been found to be excessive under the pre- sent financial conditions. A revised scheme on more humble lines has been suggested and the estimates for this are under preparation by the Public Works Department. 14. Tours. In November 1915 and again in March 1916, I visited the Army Remount Depôts at Mona and
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 5 Sargodha, and with the assistance of the Veterinary Officers of the Depôts carried out a number of experiments on the immunization of the young stock against Strangles. I attended the. Science Congress held at Lucknow on January 13th to 15th, 1916, and presented a paper on "Protective Inoculation of Stock in India." From February 7th to 12th, I attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture held at the Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, Bihar. During August 1915, Dr. Macalister toured with the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, in Bihar, in connection with the investigation of the disease Kumri of horses. II. PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. 15. Rinderpest Serum. During the year 1915-16, 1,186,550 doses of rinderpest serum were prepared and 969,460 doses issued against 1,388,560 doses prepared and 1,382,050 issued during the year 1914-15. The decrease in the demand for this serum is mainly accounted for by the reduced prevalence of the disease in most provinces; this decline was greatest in the United Provinces, Bihar and Orissa and the Central Provinces ; an increased number of outbreaks occurred in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. Shortage of Veterinary Assistants, owing to the number that have gone on Military Service, also probably limited inoculation work in some cases. Throughout the year a balance in hand of about two lacs of doses was maintained. 16. The total amount of the bills for sale of anti-rinder- pest serum issued during the year 1915-16 comes to Rs. 1,09,566.* *NOTE.6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST By adding to this the cost of 92,422 doses supplied free to the Military Department the total revenue from this source would amount to Rs. 1,21,119. 17. The following table collated from the returns received in this office will show the results of anti-rinder- pest serum injections carried out in the field during the year 1915-16.

FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 7 18. With reference to the above table it may be pointed out that the figures in the column " Number of animals which died after inoculation " include all those animals that were infected at the time of inoculation, which serum cannot be expected to save, and those which became infected after the protective action of the serum had passed off, as well as the more susceptible animals which the serum failed to protect; the proportion of the latter class is therefore much smaller than the figures indicate. In several instances in which the number of deaths reported following inoculation has been higher than usual, enquiry has shown that the doses of serum employed were too small in view of the obvious virulence of the outbreak. Thus the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, in referring to the number of deaths after inoculation in the District of Puri, which amounted to 191 out of the total for the province of 484, states, " It was due to carelessness on the part of the Veterinary Assistant in not making proper enquiries into the deaths and increasing the dose (of serum) accordingly. It was no fault of the serum." 19. Anthrax serum. 71,870 doses of this serum were prepared and 48,337 issued during the year under report as against 18,640 doses prepared and 20,883 issued during last year. The demand for this serum was very heavy during the early part of the year and as its preparation occupies nearly three months and the issued dose is large (15 cc.) some difficulty was experienced in complying at once with the orders. At the close of the year a large stock remained in hand to meet any similar emergency. 20. The results obtained in the field from inoculations with anthrax serum have been very satisfactory as the

A large stock of hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum is now held to meet any similar demand. As hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccine can be prepared at short notice it is unnecessary to keep a large supply in hand. The following table shows the quantities prepared and issued during the past five years :10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST 22.

The above three villages were visited by me on 5th April, i.e., 10 days after the vaccination for ascertaining the results. The results are very satisfactory. One animal in village Lehga Bhanda indicated symptoms of slight swelling at the seat of inoculation and lameness on the 3rd day of inoculation and these disappeared on the 5th day of inocu- lation. " The age of the animal which showed the above symp- toms was 2 years. " Animals of from 6 months to 3 years of age were vaccinated." 25. The total number of doses issued amounted to 20,257 as against 6,333 doses during the preceding year. 26.

FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 13 27. Strangles Serum and Vaccine. During the year 1915-16, 11,242 doses of this serum were manufactured and 17,132 issued against 16,118 doses prepared and 3,988 doses issued in 1914-15. The largest previous issue of this serum in one year was 12,192 doses in 1913-14. In addition, 656 doses of anti-streptococcic and 1,350 doses of mixed anti-streptococcic and staphylococcic vaccines were prepared and issued. The above serum and vaccines were supplied mainly to the Army Remount Depôts for the treatment and experi- mental immunization of horses against strangles. 28. Mallein. The demand for mallein was fully main- tained; 30,332 doses being issued as against 31,104 doses in 1914-15, which was double the issue of any previous year. 28,009 doses were prepared as against 37,766 doses in 1914-15. In addition 7,127 doses of ophthalmic mallein were prepared and 112 doses issued; this form of mallein had not previously been issued from the Muktesar Laboratory. 29. Tuberculin. Out of 730 doses, the outstanding balance of the preceding year, 430 doses were issued during the year 1915-16 against 140 doses issued in 1914-15. 30. Miscellaneous Vaccines. During the year under report several specimens of material from various infective conditions, chiefly in horses, were received at the Laboratory and from these autogenous bacterial vaccines were prepared for use in the treatment of the infections. In all 95 doses of staphylococcic vaccine and 205 doses of bacterial vaccines of different kinds were supplied, the reports received of their value in practice have been very satisfactory. The following is an extract from one of these reports sent by the Veterinary Officer, Army Remount Depôt, Sargodha.
14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST " The autogenous vaccine used on a case of 'Fistulous Withers' had a very excellent effect. Following each injec- tion there was a gradual diminution of the discharge and at the present time the fistulous openings are almost completely cicatrised." 31. Specimens examined. During the year under report, 125 specimens were received at the Laboratory for examina- tion and report, against 132 during the previous year. In the following statement the details of the specimens examined are shown :FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 15 32. Training. During the past year one Veterinary Graduate and one Dairy Manager underwent a course of training in inoculation methods. Mr. W. A. Pool, Professor, Punjab Veterinary College, reported his arrival at this Laboratory on 3rd July 1915 for 3 months' experimental study and left on 28th September 1915. Mr. P. G. Patel, Assistant to the Imperial Pathological Entomologist, conducted a series of experiments with flies in the transmission of surra, at Muktesar as well as at Bareilly, for a period of about 3 months. III. RESEARCH WORK. 33. Rinderpest. Up to the present no drug or combi- nation of drugs has been found to exert any markedly beneficial effect on the course of an attack of rinderpest. Experiments in this direction have therefore been discon- tinued. Observations on the preservation of rinderpest virus have been continued and extended to include a study of the duration of vitality of the virus under natural conditions. The importance of obtaining accurate information on this latter point was brought to the notice of the Board of Scientific Advice and the request was made that the investi- gation might be conducted at Muktesar. A report of the experiments is being prepared and will be submitted for publication shortly. With the object of increasing the output of serum and effecting economies in the cost of its production, without any decrease of its potency, comparative tests were carried out of various methods of bleeding the hyperimmune animals for serum. A revised procedure was found to give superior results to the existing routine method and this has now been adopted. An account of the experiments is ready for publication. At the same time the yield of serum obtained
16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST from the blood by a new method of clotting was compared with that given by centrifugalisation alone and found to give superior results. A report of the method has been submitted for publication by Dr. Norris. A number of serological observations were also made by Dr. Macalister with the view of ascertaining whether the potency of anti-rinderpest serum could be determined by this means instead of having to employ numbers of hill bulls for the purpose, as at present, but so far the results have been negative. 34. Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic SepticFOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 17 appearance until late in the winter, it is not yet possible to arrive at any conclusions as to the results of the experiments. The value of both anti-serum and vaccines in the treatment of the disease was frequently demonstrated and the increased issues of these agents indicate the extent to which Veterinary Officers are appreciating this fact. 37. Contagious abortion. No further outbreak of this disease has been reported from the Government Farm at Hissar, but its appearance amongst the mares of the donkey stud at the Army Remount Depôt at Mona, towards the close of the year under report, gave an opportunity for making a bacteriological examination of the condition. An organism has been isolated from an aborted f18 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST kindly sent to the Laboratory by Mr. G. Taylor, Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, South Punjab, and three different strains of the organism have been culti- vated. In addition to utilizing these for the preparation of tuberculin, a study will be made of their cultural and other characters for the purpose of determining to which variety of the organism they belong. A form of paralysis in sheep occurring in the Aligarh district was also investigated, but neither the presence of a causal organism nor of any very pronounced lesions could be demonstrated in the cases submitted for examination. 40. The following papers were forwarded from the Laboratory for publication during the year under report:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH 1916. 19 sera is three times as large as that of anti-rinderpest serum, the total quantity of serum prepared was actually 482,315 cc. more than the total for 1914-15, itself a record year. In addition, the issue of hæmorrhagic septicæmia and black quarter vaccine showed a large increase over 1914- 15; special vaccines and ophthalmic mallein were issued for the first time and the output of ordinary mallein was but little short of that for the preceding year. On account of the numerous changes in the staff and the difficulties connected with the water and fodder supplies, defective centrifuges, and delays in the delivery of glass- ware, etc., from England, the maintenance of the large out- put from the Laboratory imposed a considerable strain upon all members of the staff concerned. During my absence from Muktesar in the winter, the routine serum and vaccine preparation was under the direct charge of Dr. Macalister, and I am greatly indebted to him for his willing co-operation at all times. The three European Laboratory Assistants have discharged their responsible duties with care and thoroughness and their services are fully appreciated. Mr. Goffi while acting as Farm Manager has displayed energy and tact in carrying out the duties of the post; as a result a welcome change has been produced in the work of the farm staff and the condition of the estate. I also wish to record my appreciation of the services of Rai Sahib Pandit Krishna Nand, Office Superintendent, whose long experience and knowledge of the office work and local conditions, have been of the greatest assistance to me in dealing with the many difficulties of administra- tion encountered during the past year.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917. (A. LESLIE SHEATHER, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.) I. ADMINISTRATION. Mr. A. W. Shilston, M.R.C.V.S., held charge of the current duties of the Imperial Bacteriologist up to the 10th October, 1916, in addition to his own as Assistant Bacterio- logist. On the 11th October, 1916,I relieved him and held the post of Imperial Bacteriologist till the end of the year under report. Dr. G. H. K. Macalister, M.A., M.D., D.P.H., held the office of Pathologist up to the 12th November, 1916, after which his services were placed at the disposal of the Army Department for employment in the Central Laboratory at Basra. The post of Physiological Chemist remained vacant throughout the year owing to the services of Dr. R. V. Norris, M.Sc., A.I.C., D.Sc., having been temporarily trans- ferred to the Military Department in October, 1915. Mr. S. E. Andrews held the post of Engineer throughout the year. Mr. A. J. Hearsey was appointed Farm Manager on probation for one year with effect from 14th July, 1916. Mr. V. R. Phadke, a graduate of the Bombay Veterinary College, who underwent a course of training in Bacteriology and Pathology in England, was appointed to the new post of Veterinary Deputy Superintendent for the inoculation of cattle in the Military Dairies.
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST Fodder supply. During the past year the arrange- ments made for obtaining hay supply were very satisfactory. Three local contractors were engaged in place of one, and a much larger quantity of hay than usual was collected. The yield of fodder from the Laboratory area was also in excess of that obtained in previous years, and efforts are being made to increase it. The arrangements for grain supply were satisfactory, but on account of difficulty experienced in obtaining trans- port we were compelled to increase slightly the rates for carriage from Haldwani to Muktesar. Forests. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Naini Tal Division, has practically completed the working-plan for the forest areas, and it is expected that in future nearly 30,000 maunds of fuel will be available annually from the forests instead of only 10,000 maunds as prescribed under the old working-plan. Water supply. The question of water supply is becom- ing more and more difficult every year. Owing to heavy falls of snow during February and March, 1917, the supply of water was maintained without much difficulty during the concluding portion of the year. In the beginning of the year under report to overcome the scarcity of water, arrangements had to be made to augment the supply by the erection of three " Collecting Diggis " in the vicinity of springs. Considerable manual labour is required for the utilization of this water. To economize in this direction a small portable pump has been ordered and will be used shortly to raise the water collected in the diggis to the well, from which it will be raised to the distribution tanks by means of our electrically driven pump. Towards the end of March, the trouble connected with the water supply was rendered more acute by the stoppage of the pump. The Public Works Department recently notified that the proposed electrical pumping scheme referred to in the last
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 3 year's report is being delayed on account of the difficulty experienced in getting pumps and pipe lines in this country. Electric Centrifuges. The three new centrifuges referred to in last year's report have been erected and are giving satisfaction. The question of obtaining six more centrifuges of the same pattern in place of nine as originally proposed, has been approved of by Government, and an indent is being prepared by the Public Works Department for submission to the makers in England. The three old condemned centrifuges which remained in workable condition at the close of last year have since all become unsafe to run. Supply of hill bulls and plains animals. Under the arrangements in force no difficulty was experienced in pro- curing animals either from the hills or from the plains. Bareilly Branch Laboratory. The Imperial Bacterio- logist was unable to go to Bareilly in consequence of his arrival at Muktesar only in October, 1916. The Branch Laboratory was, however, kept open throughout the winter for the maintenance of a supply of rinderpest virus for the inoculations at Government Military Dairies. Tours. Mr. Shilston visited Bareilly early in April and in October, 1916, to see the Agricultural Adviser to the Gov- ernment of India regarding the construction of the new Branch Laboratory at Izatnagar and to consult with him on some other important subjects. Mr. Shilston visited Mona Remount Depôt on the 23rd October, 1916, at the request of the Director General of Re- mounts, to investigate a peculiar disease amongst horses. On the return journey he saw the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, at Amritsar regarding dourine and halted one day at Bareilly to see the experi- ments there, returning to Muktesar on the 29th October. He again proceeded to Bareilly on the 4th November, 1916, to initiate inoculations against rinderpest by the simul- taneous method in the military dairy farms, and visited Sitapur Military Dairy Farm. Between the 9th and 15th
4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST November he toured in company with the Chief Superin- tendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, to demon- strate the method of collecting material for the diagnosis of dourine. After this Mr. Shilston visited Military Dairies at Sita- pur and Cawnpore for the purpose of inoculating cattle, and at the end of November he saw the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India at Delhi. During the 1st and 2nd week of December, Mr. Shilston visited Allahabad and Agra Dairy Farms to inoculate dairy cattle there, returning to Muktesar on the 12th December. On the 5th January he again went down to Bareilly and from there visited Karnal to inoculate dairy cattle. From the 19th January onward he toured in the Madras Presi- dency with the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Madras, at the request of the Madras Government, to enquire into the question of suppression of rinderpest in that province. Between the 3rd and 7th February he in- oculated cattle at the Military Dairy, Bangalore, and subse- quently visited Belgaum and Bombay. Dr. Macalister carried out investigations in connection with Kumri in Assam and toured there with the Super- intendent, Civil Veterinary Department. II. PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. Rinderpest serum. During the year 1916-17, 1,243,670 doses of anti-rinderpest serum were prepared and 1,409,220 doses were issued as against 1,186,550 doses prepared and 969,460 doses issued during the year 1915-16. The increase in the demand was due to the prevalence of this disease in nearly all provinces. The total amount of the bills for sale of anti-rinderpest serum issued during the year under report comes to Rs. 1,60,021* as against Rs. 1,09,566, realized during the previous year. * This amount includes Rs. 17,186 realized for the year 1915-16. Bills amounting to Rs. 16,228 are still awaiting payment and have to be carried over to next year's account.
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 5 By adding to this the cost of 154,750 doses supplied free to the Military Department, the total revenue from this source would amount to Rs. 1,79,364. The subjoined table compiled from the returns received in this office shows the results of anti-rinderpest serum injections carried out in the field during the year 1916-17 :6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The figures given in the above table of the animals in- oculated with serum include animals which were infected at the time of inoculation and which serum cannot be expected to save, those which became infected after the protective action of the serum had passed off, as well as the more sus- ceptible animals which the serum failed to protect. As the mortality was only 0.49 per cent. of the whole number, we are justified in concluding that this serum is of the utmost practical value. The Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Assam, in referring to the number of deaths after inocula- tion in Assam in the return for the quarter ending 30th September, 1916, which amounted to 116 out of 4,931 animals inoculated, states that- " 102 deaths occurred on one tea garden. An Inspector visited the garden 20 days after inoculation and found that 405 animals had been inoculated, that 201 of these were attacked and 85 died. Of these 85, about 43 contracted the disease within 9 days after inoculation. The animals were inoculated on the 8th to 10th July, 1916. Many of the coolies objected to inoculation and a large number (675) were not inoculated. Rinderpest persisted in the garden, and on the 8th to 12th August, 483 animals were inoculated or re-inoculated, out of which 131 were attacked and 17 died. The dose of serum was 25 c. c. (a few large animals got 30 c. c.) A certain number (43) of cattle died, as they were evidently inoculated in the incubative stage of the disease. The disease was of a very virulent type and I think the dose was not quite sufficient. The disease subsided after the second inoculation. The explanation of the figures in column 6 of the chart, viz., number not inoculated, is that the animals were either suffering from the disease or hidden in the jungle by the coolies." Similarly the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Depart- ment, Bengal, states thatFOR THE YEAR- ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 7 at Hariharpur village, where the owner kept his herd far away from his home having no sensible men to look after it." As regards the efficacy of this serum, the Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, United Provinces, in his Annual Report, paragraph 22, page 3, for the year ending 31st March, 1916, states :8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The following table shows the results obtained in the field from inoculations with anthrax serum:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 9 tured and 157,065 doses issued during the year under report, as against 127,365 doses prepared and 79,965 issued in the year 1915-16. The number of doses of hæmorrhagic septicæmia vac- cine prepared and issued during the year 1916-17 was 146,540 against 124,150 prepared and issued in the preced- ing year. The demand for both h æ morrhagic septicæmia serum and vaccine is increasing and steps are now being taken to augment the supply of these products. As regards the efficacy of the serum, the Superintend- ent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bombay Presidency, in his Annual Report for the year 1915-16 (paragraph 18) states:10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST PROVINCE Number of outbreaks in which inoculation was undertaken NUMBER OF ANIMALS WHICH DIED UNINOCULATED IN COURSE OF DISEASE NUMBER OF ANI- MALS INOCULATED NUMBER OF ANIMALS WHICH DIED AFTER IN- OCULATION Percentage of deaths in inoculated bovines Equines Bovines Others Equines Bovines Others Equines Bovines Others REMARKS Bengal 59 .. 601 .. .. 9,070 .. .. 22 .. ..

This statement also applies to Hæmorrhagic Septi- cæmia vaccinations and Rinderpest inoculations." Strangles serum and vaccine. During the year under report, 4,195 doses of this serum were prepared and 9,063 issued as against 11,242 doses manufactured and 17,132 issued in 1915-16. Besides this, 260 doses of anti-streptococcic and 500 doses of mixed anti-streptococcic and staphylococcic vac- cines were prepared and issued. The demand for the above serum and vaccines was mainly from the Army Remount Depôts for the treatment and experimental immunization of horses against strangles. Mallein. The demand for mallein was maintained fully throughout the year. Thirty-five thousand nine hun- dred and seventy-two doses were issued as against 30,332 doses in the preceding year, which was much more than the average issue of the five previous years as will be seen from the following table:14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST Miscellaneous vaccines. As in the previous year material from various infective conditions chiefly from horses was received at this Laboratory for the preparation of autogenous vaccines. In all 690 doses of a special vaccine and 50 of pleurisy vaccine were prepared and issued. Specimens examined. During the year under report 230 specimens were received for examination and report at this Laboratory as against 125 specimens during the preced- ing year. The subjoined table indicates the nature of these:FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 15 Serum test for the diagnosis of Dourine. The study of the complement fixation test and its application to the diagnosis of dourine in India, was taken up by Mr. Shilston early in the year. The discovery that this disease was widely establishad in the Punjab and Baluchistan and threatening seriously to interfere with horse-breeding operations, made the working out of a reliable diagnostic method a matter of great importance. The progress of the investigation was much interfered with by pressure of routine work and the necessity of mak- ing various tours, but a considerable number of tests were carried out before the close of the year. Reports were furnished on 131 specimens of serum, received from the Civil and Army Remount Veterinary Officers as follows:16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST In October Mr. Phadke was deputed to Bareilly to continue and supervise experiments initiated by the Assist- ant Bacteriologist. During November, 1916, the Assistant Bacteriologist and Mr. Phadke carried on inoculations by the simultane- ous method in the Government Military Dairies at Sitapur and Cawnpore. During December and January the animals at Allaha- bad, Agra and Karnal dairies, were inoculated and frequent visits were paid by the Deputy Superintendent to all these five dairies to supervise the reactions of inoculated cattle. In February, 1917, the Assistant Bacteriologist initi- ated inoculations in the dairy cattle in South India and Mr. Phadke carried them on in the Dairies at Bangalore, Wellington and Belgaum. A detailed report on the inoculations carried out in November and December, 1916, at the Sitapur, Cawnpore, Allahabad and Agra Dairy Farms was duly submitted by Mr. Shilston to the Assistant Director of Dairy Farms, Northern Circle, in January, 1917. During winter of the year under report, 446 animals were treated by the serum simultaneous method at the Mili- tary Dairy Farms in India. Of these, 306 including 60 buffaloes, 94 country bred, 119 half bred and 3 Ayrshire bulls, were treated in Northern Circle Dairies at Sitapur, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Agra and Karnal, and 142 animals including 80 country bred, 53 half bred, 1 pure bred, 2 Australian short horn and 4 Ayrshire bulls in the Southern Circle at Bangalore and Wellington. The majority of these animals treated by the above method at the various farms showed moderate reactions, and it is anticipated that an active and lasting immunity against rinderpest has been established. There were no mortalities amongst these animals from rinderpest as a result of serum simultaneous inoculation, but some 8 animals (7 half bred and 1 country bred) while
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 17 reacting to the simultaneous inoculation developed piro- plasmosis, diagnosis being confirmed by the detection of piroplasmata in blood by microscopic examination. Of these, 6 were successfully treated by the subcutaneous administration of Trypan Blue, but in the case of two half breds death was so sudden that treatment could not be carried out. Besides these inoculations, natural outbreaks of rinder- pest at Belgaum and Mhow were attended to and suppressed by inoculating all the animals on the farm (some 1,300) with serum alone. At Bangalore a natural outbreak occurred amongst the untreated milking stock: this was suppressed by means of serum inoculations. None of the animals previously treated by the simultaneous method became infected during this outbreak. III. RESEARCH WORK. Several factors have combined to limit the amount of research work that could be carried out during the past year. The routine work of the Laboratory and the diffi- culties of administration were greatly increased. The departure of Dr. Macalister, shortly after my arrival, again reduced the number of officers on the staff to two. During the first half of the year Mr. Shilston's time was very fully occupied with duties of administration and the mainten- ance of the increasing output of sera and vaccines. Later he was touring in the Madras Presidency, supervising in- oculations at the Military Dairies and initiating tests for the diagnosis of dourine, outbreaks of which disease have assumed serious proportions in the Punjab and Baluchistan. In these circumstances the amount of time that I was able to devote to research work was very small. Rinderpest. A large number of observations have been made regarding the vitality of the virus of rinderpest under various artificial conditions. A report of the results obtained will be submitted for publication shortly.
18 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST The method of obtaining serum by the oxalate process is being practised on a larger scale in order to cope with the enormous increase in the demands, and will shortly be applied to the whole of the serum production at Muktesar. In the course of the inoculations carried out at. the Military Dairies several valuable observations were made regarding methods of immunization. Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Efforts are being made to accelerate the production of the anti-sera for these diseases. It is anticipated that labour and materials will be economized. Kumri. A report on Kumri was submitted for publi- cation by Dr. Macalister before he left Muktesar for mili- tary duty. It embodies an account of the disease and his work regarding the nature of the pathological changes produced. Further research on the disease has had to be postponed for the present. Strangles. Anti-strangles serum and vaccine have been supplied in fairly large quantities for the treatment of the disease and have given satisfactory results. Contagious abortion. Contagious abortion in cattle has been reported from some of the military dairies. Efforts are being made to isolate the causal organism of this disease. Pleuro-pneumonia of goats. During the last month or two of the year under report some experiments were carried out in connection with this disease. Failure to obtain sus- ceptible animals for experimental purposes interrupted the work, but the subject will be taken up again when suitable animals become available. Surra. Some experiments in connection with the treat- ment of surra have been carried out but so far without success. Tuberculosis. Modification of the culture medium used for the preparation of tuberculin has accelerated its
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 19 production very considerably, and a large stock is now available. The study of strains of the tubercle bacillus isolated from cattle in this country is being continued. Dourine. During the past year a trypanosome infec- tion of horses transmitted by coitus made its appearance in the Punjab and Baluchistan and evidently has a wide dis- tribution in the horse-breeding areas. Its existence is seriously interfering with the progress of horse-breeding, especially in the Army Remount Department Circles. The diagnosis of the disease in its early stages presents great difficulties. A laboratory method of examining the serum of suspected cases known as the complement fixation test has been successfully applied in America, for the detection, of infected animals and the study of its applicability to the disease in this country has been taken up by Mr. Shilston. A large number of tests have been carried out with promising results, and it is hoped that by this means the officers of the Civil Veterinary Department and Army Remount Department may be assisted in stamping out the disease. Miscellaneous. The occurrence of a chronic form of enteritis has been reported from one of the military dairies. Examination of specimens from two cases appears to indi- cate that the condition is that known in Europe under the name Johne's Disease. Two animals suspected of being infected are under observation. Publications. During the year under report the fol- lowing papers were submitted for publication :20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGIST M.D., D.P.H., Pathologist. Memoirs of the Depart- ment of Agriculture in India, Veterinary Series, Vol. II, No. 8. General Remarks. The appearance of Foot and Mouth disease in our outkraals early in November, 1916, caused great difficulty in providing accommodation for seg- regated as well as healthy animals. Temporary sheds were erected by our own labour for isolation, etc. Relapsing fever broke out amongst the coolies and gwalas* in the last week in December, 1916. Up to the 3rd week of March, 1917, 46 cases with 14 deaths were recorded. The disease was prevented from assuming more serious proportions by the prompt introduction of sanitary measures. Only two or three cases occurred during the last month of the outbreak. The maintenance of the increased output of sera and vaccines during the last year, difficulties experienced in obtaining material on account of war, and paucity of water supply and labour imposed a heavy strain on the members of the staff. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Shilston for the assistance that he has rendered me at all times and for placing his experience and knowledge of local conditions freely at my disposal. The prompt and energetic measures taken by Mr. Andrews on the occasions when the water pump broke down prevented a very serious interruption of the work of the Laboratory. His services in connection with the whole of the plant under his charge are fully appreciated. The three European Laboratory Assistants have carried out their responsible duties with care and thoroughness and their zeal and energy is to be commended. Mr. Goffi acted as Farm Manager till July 14th, when he was relieved by Mr. A. J. Hearsey. The improvements effected by Mr. Goffi in the work of the Farm staff and the condition of the estate have been maintained, and every * Gwalas = Cattlemen.
FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1917 21 effort is being made to render the estate still more produc- tive. The services of Rai Sahib Pandit Krishna Nand, Office Superintendent, have been of the utmost value to me in deal- ing with many administrative and other difficulties that have arisen during the year. His long experience and knowledge of local conditions have been placed freely at my disposal. The great increase in the office work and changes render- ed necessary by the retirement of the Accountant, Rai Sahib Pandit Nitya Nand, have entailed a considerable strain on the office staff. The manner in which the work has been carried on deserves special commendation.

ANNUAL REPORT OF The Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31 ST MARCH, 1918. (A. LESLIE SHEATHER, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.) I. ADMINISTRATION. Staff. I remained in charge of the office of Director and First Bacteriologist * throughout the year, and Mr. Shilston held the post of Second Bacteriologist * except between the 14th June and 8th October, 1917, when his services were placed at the disposal of the Army Department for special duty in Mesopotamia. Lieut. E. C. Bowes, A.V.C., officiated for him during this interval. The posts of Pathologist and Physiological Chemist re- mained vacant during the year under report. Lieut. Bowes officiated as Pathologist between the 9th October and 30th November, 1917, on special duty. Mr. Andrews was in charge of the electric installation and other plants during the year under report, except from the 12th October to 18th November, 1917, when he was on deputation to the N.-W. Railway. Mr. N. K. Vacha was appointed on probation to the second post of Veterinary Deputy Superintendent sanctioned by * The designation of Imperial Bacteriologist was changed to Director and.

Tours. Between 16th and 21st of September, 1917, I visited Simla to see the Agricultural Adviser to the Govern- ment of India, and between 7th and 17th of December, 1917, accompanied by Mr. Shilston, attended the meeting of the Board of Agriculture at Poona. The serum-making at Kargaina (Bareilly) was started by the Second Bacteriologist on October 29th after his return from special duty in Mesopotamia, and at the request of the Director of Veterinary Services in India he visited Karachi between the 17th and 29th December, 1917, to investigate an outbreak of glanders among mules newly landed there. Training. During the past year Mr. R. V. Pillai, Laboratory Assistant, Bengal Veterinary College, and Mohammad Yusuf, Veterinary Assistant, Kashmir State, underwent a course of training at this laboratory. Fodder and grain supply. The arrangements for obtaining hay and grain were as in previous years and were found satisfactory. Forests. During the past year sufficient fuel was obtained from our own forest now worked under the new Working Plan, and its administration was carried on satisfactorily. Water supply. The new electrical pumping project to augment the water supply at Muktesar is still in the course of construction and will, it is hoped, be completed during the year 1918-19. Owing to the almost continuous rain during the summer months in 1917, the question of water supply did not become very acute. It was found necessary, however, to issue water tickets for some weeks, and a considerable amount of labour had to be employed in obtaining and distributing water during this period. Electric centrifuges. Reference to the statement regarding the increased output of the laboratory will indicate the pressing necessity of the new centrifuges which are on order. The existing machines were run continuously There was no opportunity of thoroughly overhauling them and

The cost of these animals had to be raised slightly and the demand was fulfilled without any difficulty under the existing arrangements. Bareilly Branch Laboratory. To meet the increasing demands for anti-rinderpest serum and to maintain rinderpest virus for use in the inoculation of animals at the Govern- ment Military Dairies, it was found necessary to open the Branch Laboratory at Kargaina (Bareilly) during the winter months, and to maintain between 150 and 200 serum-making animals there. The experience gained shows that the accommodation and area of land available at Kargaina are quite insufficient for the work that has to be carried on there. A number of temporary grass chappars (sheds) were erected for the animals, but these proved to be very unsatisfactory owing to their fragile nature and to the impossibility of disinfecting them. The lack of ground area and housing accommodation was felt the more seriously owing to the successive appearances of foot-and-mouth disease, hæmorrhagic septicæmia and black quarter among the serum-making animals. It was also a matter of difficulty to isolate animals required as controls. The total amount of anti-rinderpest serum prepared at and despatched from Kargaina up to the end of March, 1918, was 404,847 doses. Financial aspect. It is very satisfactory to note that with effect from 1st September, 1917, the Government of India have sanctioned charges for all routine products of this laboratory. It would not be out of place to mention that during the year 1917-18, the total value of different products, calculated on the basis fixed by Government, amounts to Rs. 4,15,080 against an expenditure of Rs. 3,36,481.* General remarks. Foot-and-mouth disease was present among the animals in the outkraals during the whole year, with the exception of a period of six weeks in April and May, but, by constructing temporary sheds for segrega- * Includes an expenditure of Rs. 7,591-15-3 incurred in connection with the inoculation in Military Dairies.

During the past year on two occasions, (i) end of June, 1917, and (ii) on the 8th October, 1917, relapsing fever broke out among our coolies and gwalas (cattlemen). The second outbreak, being of a serious nature, caused panic among them and a large number ran away. Scarcity of labour was a source of great anxiety during the latter part of the year. Arrangements had to be made for transport of the laboratory products through contractors, local labour had to be obtained for farm work, and for a time serum-making animals had to be kept in outkraals as there was not sufficient low caste labour to attend to them in the inner sheds. During the year under review, the output of the products of this laboratory was increased to nearly double that of last year. To minimize the strain imposed on the staff two temporary dressers and four bearers were appointed. The Ministry of Agriculture, Cairo, is still being supplied every month with 50,000 doses of anti-rinderpest serum and this will be continued up to December. The request of the Veterinary Department of Sudan Government to supply them with 200,000 doses of anti- rinderpest serum before September, 1918, is also being complied with. During the past year the demand for mallein from the Military Department was immensely increased, but all indents were complied with. All members of the staff worked cheerfully and energetic- ally notwithstanding the heavy strain imposed upon them throughout the year. II. PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. Rinderpest serum. During the year 1917-18, 2,146,421 doses of anti-rinderpest serum were prepared as against 1,243,670 doses prepared during the year 1916-17, and 2,069,961 doses issued as against 1,409,220 doses during the previous year.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 5 The Military Department indented 271,420 doses of this serum during the past year as against 154,750 doses supplied during 1916-17. The results obtained in the field from inoculations with this serum are shown in the subjoined table :6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Two hundred and forty-six (246) animals were inoculated by our staff in Gohna village close by the laboratory. The results have been very satisfactory. No deaths occurred in the inoculated herd and the disease was stamped out immediately. Anthrax serum. During the year under report *14,175 doses of anthrax serum were manufactured and 19,727 issued as against 11,029 manufactured and 29,069 issued during the year 1916-17. The following table shows the results of inoculations in the field with anthrax serum :MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 7 The following table shows the details of the results of inoculations in the field with hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum:8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Black Quarter vaccine. During the year under report as well as during the previous year, no necessity arose to manufacture more black quarter vaccine as the demands were complied with from the stock in hand. Seventeen thousand three hundred and twenty-four (17,324) doses were issued as against 3,350 doses during the preced- ing year. The following table furnishes the details of inoculations in the field with black quarter vaccine together with the results of such inoculations : MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 9 In addition to this 2,655 doses of mixed anti-strepto- coccic and staphylococcic vaccine and 550 doses of anti- streptococcic vaccine were prepared and issued. The demand for these serums and vaccines was chiefly from the Army Department. Tuberculin. One thousand one hundred and eighty (1,180) doses of tuberculin were prepared and 381 issued as against 82 doses prepared and 377 issued during the year 1916-17. Miscellaneous vaccines. As in the previous year, material from infective conditions, chiefly from horses, was received in the laboratory for the preparation of autogenous vaccines. In all 150 doses were prepared and issued. The following table compares the amounts of the various products of the laboratory prepared and issued during the year 1917-18 with the average amounts of the preceding 5 years.

III. EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS AND INOCULATION WORK. Specimens examined. During the past year 513 specimens were received for examination and report as against 230 in the preceding year. The following table shows the nature of the specimens:MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 11 Serum test for diagnosis of Dourine. Owing to the deputation of the Second Bacteriologist to Mesopotamia and the difficulties connected with the preparation and standardization of the necessary reagents, the progress of this investigation was greatly interrupted. In addition to experimental tests, reports were furnished on 284 specimens of serum received from Civil and Army Remount Depart- ment Veterinary Officers, as follows : 42 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, they could not be given immunity except by the injection of serum only. Twenty-four Ayrshire bulls were inoculated by the simultaneous method; twenty gave marked reactions and re- covered, and two failed to react after two injections of virulent blood. The remaining two bulls treated at Bagarji developed foot-and-mouth disease after failing to react to their first injection of virulent blood and so could not be re-inoculated; their immunity being due only to the serum given was there- fore temporary. Ten of the bulls developed piroplasmosis, nine getting the infection from the blood inoculation and one developing it naturally. All were given Trypan-blue and recovered. One bull, however, at Bagarji, which contracted the disease by tick infection, died suddenly a few days after recovery, the cause of death not being ascertained. A few cases of piroplasmosis occurred among half-bred stock but all recovered under treatment; no trouble was ex- perienced with the country stock. In the great majority of cases good reactions were obtained without a single death except those mentioned as being due to the additional infection of foot-and-mouth disease at Bagarji. A total of 1,498 animals were inoculated by the simul- taneous method.

MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 13 IV. RESEARCH. Shortness of staff and increase in routine and adminis- tration duties have again seriously limited the time that could be given to research work. Rinderpest. The question of the vitality of the virus of rinderpest under varying conditions is still under inves- tigation, and a special series of experiments is being carried out with the object of ascertaining the length of time for which hides removed from animals dead of rinderpest remain infective. Anthrax and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. The modifications in the manufacture of these sera foreshadowed in last year's report have been effected and have resulted in a very distinct reduction in the mortality among the serum- making animals, and also in a saving of labour. The question as to the length of time hides from animals dead of hæmorrhagic septicæmia remain infective is also under investigation. Contagious Abortion in cattle. A number of attempts were made to isolate the organism responsible for this disease from pathological materials sent to the labora- tory, but all failed owing to the presence of numerous contaminating organisms. A culture of the bacillus responsible for the disease in Europe was obtained through the courtesy of Sir John McFadyean of the Royal Veterinary College. This strain is now kept running in the laboratory. Up to the present the number of tests carried out is too small to warrant any definite opinion, but the results of these tests appear to indicate that the same bacillus is responsible for the disease in India. Johne's Disease. Reference was made last year to the occurrence of this disease in India and it was stated that two suspected animals were under observation. One of these (a cross-bred cow) was killed when in extremis a month after arrival at Muktesar. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis, and microscopic examinations showed that bacilli were present throughout the length of the intestine, and that they were especially numerous in the terminal part of the small intestine and in the anterior portion of the large intestine. Attempts to obtain cultures of the bacillus failed.
14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, The other * animal under observation (an aged Delhi buffalo) was alive on March 31st, but has since died of peritonitis due to injuries to the stomach and intestines following on the ingestion of some fragments of wire and stones. This animal also proved to be infected with the disease. The lesions were not very conspicuous, and microscopic examination showed that at no place in the intestine were the bacilli at all numerous. From the time these two animals arrived at Muktesar, they were housed in a temporary wooden shed with a buffalo and a hill bull as contacts. The buffalo contracted rinderpest after having been eight months in contact. Post-mortem and microscopic examinations failed to reveal any evidence that it had contracted Johne's Disease. A fresh buffalo was placed in contact, and it and the hill bull have remained in the shed ever since. Neither has shown any clinical evidence of infection. It appears to be advisable to refer to two further cases in which a positive diagnosis has been arrived at although the materials upon which the diagnosis was based were received after the close of the year under report. The materials in question were portions of the intestines and mesenteric glands from two animals at Poona,and they were sent for confirmatory examination by the Superinten- dent, C. V. D., Bombay. As the specimens had been placed in preserving fluid, nothing beyond microscopic examination was possible. Tuberculosis. Investigations in connection with this disease of necessity make slow progress, as the bacillus grows very slowly in artificial culture, and in animal inoculations periods of weeks or months have to elapse before experi- ments come to maturity. A number of strains of tubercle bacilli have been isolated from bovine lesions and these are being studied. Pleuro-pneumonia of goats. Provision of susceptible animals for experimental work in connection with this disease was made, and a quantity of material from a natural case of the disease was received. Unfortunately pneumonia of a different type broke out among the animals selected for * Although this animal was alive at the end of the year under report, it has been thought advisable to refer to it here instead of delaying the report of its death until next year.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1918 15 experiment, and it was found impossible to use the material available with any hope of getting reliable results. When the outbreak of pneumonia was over efforts to obtain further infective material were unsuccessful. Publications. No papers recording original work were published during the course of the year. In view of the detection of cases of Johne's Disease in India it was considered advisable to publish a short account of the disease. This was accordingly done in the Agricul- tural Journal of India (Vol. XIII, Part 1.)

ANNUAL REPORT OF The Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919. (A. LESLIE SHEATHER, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.) I. ADMINISTRATION. Staff. I held charge of the office of Director and First Bacteriologist throughout the year, and Mr. Shilston remained in charge of the office of Second Bacteriologist. The posts of Pathologist and Physiological Chemist remained vacant during the year under report, as during the previous year. Mr. Andrews held charge of the post of Engineer till 14th May, 1918, the date on which he resigned his appoint- ment, and Mr. P. R. Ganguly, Assistant Engineer, acted as Engineer in addition to his own duties from that date onwards. A third post of Veterinary Deputy Superintendent for inoculation of cattle in the military dairies was sanctioned by Government. The designations of the European and the Indian Laboratory Assistants were changed to " Laboratory Assist- ants, Upper grade" and "Laboratory Assistants, Lower grade ", respectively. Tours. During April, I visited the Branch Laboratory at Kurgaina in connection with the cessation of work there (1st to 5th), and Amritsar to attend a Surra Conference (10th to 17th). Between the 14th and 19th September, 1918, I visited Simla to attend a meeting on veterinary education and also to see the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India. On my way back to Muktesar, between the 20th and 24th September, I saw the Conservator of Forests and
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, the Forest Engineer at Naini Tal regarding a ropeway scheme, and the Executive and District Engineers regarding the new pumping plant and the buildings at Muktesar. Between the 17th October and 1st November, 1918,I visited (1) Bareilly to supervise serum making at the Branch Laboratory, and (2) Sitapur to supervise inoculation of military dairy cattle. On this tour I was accompanied by the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, who wished to see the technique of serum preparation and the method of carrying out simultaneous inoculations against Cattle Plague. Between the 20th and 29th March, 1919, I visited Lahore to attend the sectional meeting of veterinary officers. Mr. Shilston visited Patwadangar between the 26th and 28th May, 1918, to enquire and advise regarding deaths among experimental rabbits at the Government Bovine Lymph Depôt. Between the 9th and 16th October he visited Bareilly to start serum preparation work at the Branch Laboratory. On the 4th November Mr. Shilston left Muktesar for Pusa for the inoculation of the herd there against Cattle Plague by simultaneous method, and on his return journey to Muktesar, between the 3rd and 18th December, he met the Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Bihar and Orissa, at Patna to advise him about laboratory fittings, and also supervised serum preparation work at the Branch Laboratory, Bareilly. On the 4th March, 1919, Mr. Shilston left Muktesar to meet the Chief Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, in connection with the dourine investigations, and returned to Muktesar on the 10th March. On the 20th March he accompanied me to Lahore to attend the sectional meeting of veterinary officers, and returned to Muktesar on the 31st March after making a halt at the Kurgaina Branch Laboratory in connection with the serum preparation work. Training. During the past year, Captains J. Cunningham and A. M. McFarlane, A. V. C., while spending a period of their leave at Muktesar, received a short course of training. Mr. J. B. Bloemendal, Government Veterinary Surgeon, Sumatra, with the permission of Government, visited this laboratory and acquainted himself with the subject of serum therapy. On his departure he took some animals infected with Indian surra for further investigations in Java.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 3 After seeing the simultaneous inoculation at Sitapur, Mr. Ware, Superintendent, Civil Veterinary Department, Madras, spent a few days at Muktesar in November, 1918, to acquaint himself with the technique of serum prepara- tion at this laboratory. Mr. H. C. Ganguly, a veterinary graduate and Labora- tory Assistant of the Bengal Veterinary College, received training for 6 weeks during May and June, 1918, in all departments of laboratory technique and serum therapy. Babu Panda, Veterinary Assistant, Bihar and Orissa, underwent a course of six months at this laboratory, and learnt laboratory technique including preparation of culture media, preparation of staining reagents and staining specimens, section cutting, etc., and also examined a very large number of specimens, mainly blood films, for diagnostic purposes. Fodder and grain supply. The arrangements for obtaining grain were, as in previous years, found satisfactory, but difficulty was not infrequently experienced in obtaining transport. Owing to the failure of the monsoon, hay was not available in large quantities, and subsidiary arrangements had to be made to feed the animals on oak leaves, etc. Contractors would not undertake to deliver more than 26,000 maunds of hay, but the amount actually delivered was only 18,748 maunds against a demand for 30,000 maunds. Forests. During the past year the new working plan was in force and the supply of fuel available was in excess of our requirements, but, on account of paucity of labour, great difficulty was experienced in extracting and transport- ing the produce to the laboratory. The administration of forests was, however, carried on satisfactorily. Water supply. Owing to unusual delay in the receipt of new pumps and pipes, etc., the project to supplement the water supply at Muktesar is still in the course of construction, but will, it is hoped, be completed shortly. The question of water supply became serious during the winter months, partly owing to the failure of the monsoon and partly owing to a further decrease in the spring feeding the well. This spring is now yielding about one-third the amount of water given during 1916-17. In spite of heavy falls of snow during February and March the water steadily decreased, and by March the very strictest economy had to be exercised. For
4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, some weeks before the end of the year under report, the consumption of water had to be reduced to less than one half the normal amount. A considerable amount of labour had to be employed, as in previous years, to obtain and distribute water, and this had to be maintained for a much longer period than formerly. Electric centrifuges. During the past year one centrifuge was out of order and the remaining two machines were run continuously. As a result of this, other methods of separation had to be adopted with a corresponding increase of work for the staff and some reduction in output. The spare centrifuge parts received from Europe do not fit the existing machines, and it is not yet known whether they will fit the new machines which are on order but which have not yet arrived. Supply of hill bulls and plains animals. The cost of these animals had again to be increased. During the winter months considerable numbers of hill bulls were brought to the laboratory for sale, but owing to the extreme shortage of hay and of labour (see general remarks) many of these could not be accepted. This may have accounted for some of the difficulty experienced in obtaining bulls subse- quently. Branch Laboratory. The Branch Laboratory at Kurgaina (Bareilly) was opened for the winter months in the second week of October, 1918, for the preparation of anti- rinderpest serum and to maintain the rinderpest virus for use in the inoculation of animals at the various military dairies. Towards the end of December, 1918, a number of serum- making animals were transferred from Muktesar to Bareilly on account of labour difficulty experienced at Muktesar. As during the previous year, a number of temporary grass chuppers (sheds) were erected for the accommodation of animals, but at the best these are very unsatisfactory make- shifts and are invariably a source of trouble. The transference of animals from Muktesar accentuated the inadequacy of the place and its equipment. The total amount of anti-rinderpest serum prepared at Bareilly during the year under report was 1,071,422 doses, of which a brew consisting of 225,170 doses prepared in March, 1919, was found contaminated and had to be
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 5 discarded. This contamination was due to want of proper laboratory equipment and cool storage accommodation. This was a serious loss especially as the demand for serum was very great. The necessity of getting the new laboratory buildings at Izatnagar, Bareilly, completed as early as possible, is an urgent one, otherwise it will be impossible to meet all demands from India for anti-rinderpest serum. Financial aspect. The total receipts from sale of the laboratory products, as per statement at the end of this report, amounted to Rs. 3,42,402-11-0* as against an expendi- ture of Rs. 4,37,712-13-4.6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, As a result of the occurrence of these diseases, panic spread among the coolie and gwala (cattleman) staffs. Prior to the outbreaks these totalled about 420, but within a week the number had fallen to 175 owing to the men absconding. Scarcity of labour remained a constant source of anxiety during the remaining part of the year. The position became so acute at one time that practically all serum-making work had to be stopped and all available labour had to be utilized in feeding the animals alone. Labour assistance was applied for from the Kumaun Labour Corps, but none was obtained. With great difficulty a number of low caste coolies were in- duced to come up from Bareilly on considerably enhanced wages but most of them absconded within a short time. The shortage of labour is still a source of great anxiety. The question of revising the salary of the menial staff of this laboratory on account of enhanced cost of living in Muktesar has been taken up. During the year under report the Government Bania resigned because he was caught profiteering, and since then the management of the shop has been taken over by the laboratory. By purchasing staple articles in the markets and arranging for transport it has been found possible to give the menial staff some relief, and it has only been by meeting them in this way that they have been prevailed upon to remain at their work. Arrangements for transport of the laboratory products were continued through the contractors as during last year, and a part of farm work also is being carried on by the local labour. Prices are steadily advancing and at times transport is quite unobtainable. It is hoped that there will be no delay in constructing the ropeway from Kathgodam for which the survey has been carried out. The completion of this will very greatly reduce the difficulties connected with supplies of all kinds. During the year under report the output of this labora- tory was increased by 1,051,685 doses as compared with the year 1917-18, and it was nearly 2.4 times that of the year 1916-17. The demands for anti-rinderpest serum from the Ministry of Agriculture, Cairo, and from the Veterinary Department, Soudan, were complied with as far as possible after the Indian demand had been met. The demand for mallein from the Military Department was maintained and, as
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 7 during last year, all indents were complied with. That the whole staff has worked well and consistently is shown by the enhanced output of the laboratory. Their energy and willingness are all the more praiseworthy as conditions during the year have at times been very trying. The thanks of the whole staff are due to Mr. Keiller, First Laboratory Assistant, Upper grade, for the unselfish way in which he has placed his time at my disposal and for the amount of work he has done in assisting me to maintain the food supplies of the population since the shop became vacant. II. PREPARATION OF SERUMS AND VACCINES. Rinderpest serum During the year under report, 3,213,043 doses of this serum were manufactured as against 2,146,421 doses prepared during the year 1917-18, and 3,259,616 doses issued as against 2,069,961 doses issued during the preceding year. Out of the amount shown above as issued, 450,700 doses were supplied to the Military Depart- ment as against 271,420 doses supplied during the previous year. The results of inoculations in the field with anti-rinder- pest serum have been detailed in the following table :8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Anthrax serum. During the year 1918-19, 46,368 doses of anthrax serum were prepared and 36,552 issued as against 14,175 doses prepared and 19,727 issued during the year 1917-18. The results obtained in the field from inoculations with this serum are shown in the subjoined table:MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 9 The following table shows the results of inoculations in the field with hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum :10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Black Quarter vaccine. During the year 1918-19, 45,000 doses of black quarter vaccine were prepared, and 19,176 doses were issued as against 17,324 issued in the preceding year. The results of inoculations in the field with black quarter vaccine have been detailed in the adjoining table MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 11 With the exception of a few hundred doses the quantity was supplied to the Military Department. Miscellaneous vaccines. From the material received 450 doses of autogenous vaccines were prepared and issued to the Remount Depôt, Sargodha. The amounts of the various products of the laboratory prepared and issued during the year under report have been compared with the average amounts of the preceding 5 years in the following table.

EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS AND INOCULATION WORK. Specimens examined. During the year 1918-19, 289 specimens were received for examination and report as against 513 in the year 1917-18.
12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, The nature of the specimens received is shown in the table below:MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 13 calves in poor condition died, as a result of the rinderpest reactions, out of 143 inoculated at Sitapur, and one cross-bred calf and one buffalo heifer died at Allahabad. In November Mr. Phadke proceeded to the Southern Circle and inoculated the stock at Bangalore. Later, twenty-seven young Ayrshire bulls arrived at Bombay and were sent to Ahmedabad to be immunized. The reactions obtained were not severe, but in four animals pneumonia developed after the rinderpest reaction and all succumbed. This unfortunate result was mainly due to the animals not having been given sufficient time to become accustomed to their new conditions of life in this country before being subjected to inoculation. Similarly five young Ayrshire bulls at the Kirkee farm were presented for inoculation shortly after arrival in this country; only four were injected as the fifth was obviously unfit to stand the reaction, but one of those treated died four days after inoculation and another died on the seventh day ; in neither case were lesions of rinderpest present but both died as the result of impaction of the stomach. These experiences clearly show that imported animals should be allowed sufficient time to become acclimatized before subject- ing them to simultaneous inoculation. The cross-bred and country stock at Kirkee showed good reactions and all recovered. During March and April, 1919, the stock at Belgaum and Jubbulpore were treated, the only fatality being a cross- bred cow at the latter farm. Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease prevented the carrying out of inoculations at Ruk and Mhow. After the conclusion of the inoculations at Allahabad, Mr. Vacha continued visiting the farms in the Northern Circle14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATRY To summarize the results of the inoculations during the winter 1918-19, 40 pure-bred imported animals were treated out of which six died, but in no case was rinderpest directly responsible for death ; 438 cross-bred stock were inoculated with six deaths; 382 buffaloes with one death and 649 country animals without a single death. The percentage mortality among the total of 1,509 animals was 0.86 or, excluding the pure-bred imported stock, only 0.47. The following table shows the number of animals treated during 1918-19 at the various farms: MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1919 15 IV. RESEARCH. What was said in the last Annual Report regarding the amount of time that could be given to research work, applies with even greater force for the year under report. A great amount of time has been of necessity expended in overcoming difficulties connected with shortages of supplies of all kinds and of labour. The enhanced output of the laboratory has also contri- buted to reducing the amount of time that could be given to research work. Rinderpest. Experiments regarding the length of time for which hides remain infective are being continued under varying atmospheric conditions. Hæmorrhagic septicæmia. Experiments similar to those with rinderpest hides are being carried out. Contagious abortion. Only a few samples of serum have been tested during the year. Johne's disease. Suspected materials from two cases of Johne's disease have been received at the laboratory.* Examination yielded a positive result in both instances. The specimens came from Bettiah (Bihar). Fresh attempts are being made to cultivate the organism. Tuberculosis. A number of strains of tubercle bacilli are under cultivation, and it is hoped that circumstances will permit of a series of inoculation experiments with cattle and buffaloes being undertaken shortly. Parasitic worms. A new species of worm causing fatal gastritis in calves was detected and a Bulletin published containing a description of it. A parasitic worm occurring in the larynx and pharynx of cattle and buffaloes has been examined, and it is hoped that an account of it will be submitted for publication shortly. Malaria. What appears to be a case of true malarial in- fection has been discovered in a buffalo and a Bulletin on the subject has been issued. Publications. During the year 1918-19 the following papers were submitted for publication. (1) A new Nematode causing Parasitic Gastritis in Calves, by A. Leslie Sheather (Agric. Res. Inst., Pusa, Bulletin No. 86). (2) A Malarial Parasite in the Blood of a Buffalo, by A. Leslie Sheather (Agric, Res. Inst., Pusa, Bulletin No. 90). *These cases were received during the last week of May and the third week of June, 1919. It has been thought advisable to refer to them here to avoid delay in notifying another district in which the disease has been detected.

ANNUAL REPORT OF The Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31st MARCH, 1920. (W. A. POOL, M.R.C.V.S.) I. ADMINISTRATION. Staff. Mr. A. Leslie Sheather, B. Sc., M.R.C.V.S., remained in charge of the office of Director and First Bacterio- logist throughout the year. Mr Shilston remained in charge of the office of Second Bacteriologist up to the 17th June, 1919. His sad death from glanders on 6th July, 1919, deprived the Veterinary Service in India and the Muktesar staff of a most capable and valuable officer. I took over charge of the duties of Second Bacteriologist on the 30th July, 1919. The post of Physiological Chemist has been abolished and in its place a new appointment has been created to be filled by an officer of the Indian Civil Veterinary Department. Both the Pathologist's and the Veterinary Officer's appointments remained vacant during the year under report. The post of a Second Assistant Bacteriologist, with two Veterinary Inspectors, four Dressers and two Peons, has been added to the staff of this laboratory in connection with the scheme for the development of cattle-breeding and dairy- ing in India. Mr. W. Pryde Watson was appointed Engineer and assumed charge of the post on the 14th June, 1919. During the year under report the three Laboratory Assistants (Upper grade), the Farm Manager, and four Veterinary Deputy Superintendents were admitted to gazetted A
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, rank. The veterinary staff was strengthened by the sanction of two Inspectors and the office by two additional posts of clerks. The appointment of an Assistant Surgeon in place of the Sub-Assistant Surgeon was sanctioned and a Civil Assistant Surgeon assumed charge of the dispensary at Muktesar during December 1919. Tours. Towards the end of May 1919, Mr. Sheather attended a Surra Conference in Delhi and in July had to go to Naini Tal to see Mr. Shilston in the hospital. During the last week in October he visited Bareilly and thence proceeded to Simla viâ Kasauli. Between the 28th November and 10th December, 1919, he went to Pusa to attend the meeting of the Board of Agriculture and also visited Bettiah Raj to test cases of Johne's disease. Between 7th and 12th January, 1920,I visited Bareilly and supervised the serum preparation work at the Branch Laboratory. Training. Major D. Bolton, R. A.V.C., visited Muktesar to study the method of simultaneous inoculation against rinderpest from 20th December, 1919, to 3rd January, 1920. Mr. K. Raghebendra Rao, Veterinary Assistant, Madras, underwent a course of training from 1st November, 1919, to 27th January, 1920. Fodder and grain. The arrangements for obtaining grain were satisfactory but difficulty was often experienced in obtaining transport. Hay, however, could not be obtained in sufficient quantity. The shortage mentioned under this heading in last year's Annual Report made itself felt acutely from August to October 1919. When the supply was exhausted, labour could not be obtained to bring in green grass and oak leaves in sufficient quantity at the seasons when they are used to augment the hay supply when necessary. In consequence, serum making had practically to be stopped during September and October. To meet the excessive demands for serum which involved the upkeep of more serum-making animals, 50,000 maunds of hay were found to be necessary and a contract was made for that amount last autumn.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1920 3 Owing to the paucity of labour, high wages demanded and the increased amount required, it was found absolutely necessary to raise the price from 13 annas to R. 1-4-0 per maund for hay. Only 35,000 maunds were delivered by the 31st March, 1919, and it is doubtful if more than another 2,000 maunds will be supplied before the date of termination of the contract. Forests. Great difficulty was experienced during the past year in extracting and transporting the produce to the laboratory on account of shortage of labour. The adminis- tration of the forests was as usual carried on satisfactorily and the supply of wood in the forests was in excess of our requirements. Water supply. The installation of the new pumps, which was completed during the year, shewed that the generating plant is not quite sufficient to meet the full requirements of the station when the water in the upper spring gets low and it is necessary to pump daily from the lower source. This occurs from March till the rains start. Plans and estimates are therefore being made to increase the generating plant by the installation of high speed generating sets in addition to the existing Hornsby engine. Electric centrifuges. The six new centrifuges have been delivered at Muktesar and are in process of erection. Supply of hill bulls and plains animals. Consider- able difficulty was experienced during the earlier months of the year in obtaining supplies of hill bulls, and at one time animals under experiment had to be sacrificed for the provi- sion of virus. Prices had to be increased again. Branch Laboratory. For the preparation of anti- rinderpest serum and to maintain the rinderpest virus, the Branch Laboratory at Kurgaina (Bareilly) was opened early in October 1919. As in previous years a number of grass chuppers (sheds) were erected for the accommodation of animals. To minimize the fodder difficulties at Muktesar, towards the end of December a large number of hill bulls were trans- ferred to-the-Branch Laboratory. The total output of rinderpest serum at Bareilly during the last winter was 1,124,816 doses as against 1,071, 422 doses during 1918-19. This output was of great assistance to meet the demands for serum which were very great. The provision of cool A 2
4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, storage accommodation at Kurgaina is one of urgent necessity and this question will be dealt with separately. The question of establishing a second bacteriological laboratory in India for the manufacture of sera and vaccine for veterinary purposes was discussed by an informal committee which arrived at a definite conclusion that Bareilly is not suitable either for a manufacturing centre or for a research institute. The Government of India concurred in this conclusion and the project for the construction of a bacteriological laboratory at Bareilly, referred to in previous reports, was dropped. The old laboratory at Kurgaina will, however, have to be kept on for some years at least, and sanction has been asked for the erection of a few more cattle sheds. Financial aspect. The receipts from sale of the laboratory products during the year amounted to Rs. 3,84,396-4-11* to which a sum of Rs. 1,43,355-2-0MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1920 5 The construction of the ropeway from Kathgodam will obviate to a great extent most of our difficulties connected with labour and supplies. During the past year the demands for the products of this laboratory were very high and were complied with as early as possible. The arrears of demands for anti- rinderpest serum were at an average of 3.9 lakhs during October and reached in November 1919 an average of 4.4 lakhs of doses. But for the shortage of fodder already mentioned, at least another 5 or 6 lakhs of doses of rinderpest serum could have been prepared. The routine of the serum making, apart from the scientific details involved in the different stages upon which the preparation of the different sera is based, has been very thoroughly overhauled and improved during this year. The serum making is now on such a large scale that considerable organization is necessary so that the utmost value may be obtained from the expenditure involved. To check accurately each stage of the serum making it was found necessary to introduce the upkeep of a good many statistics and returns, and on the clerical side card indexing has been introduced with a great saving of work and time of those employed. The reorganization has been amply justified by the improvement in the serum making results. More serum is now obtained in proportion to the expenditure involved. A heavy strain was imposed upon all members of the staff throughout the year and they worked energetically and willingly. As in the previous year, Mr. Keiller, First Laboratory Assistant (Upper grade), devoted most of his time in maintaining the staple food supplies of the station for the menial staff and so helped in dealing with the labour difficulty. The thanks of the staff are due to him. II. PREPARATION OF SERA AND VACCINES. Rinderpest serum. During the year 1919-20, 3,189,736 doses of anti-rinderpest serum were prepared as against 3,213,043 doses during the previous year; and 2,813,733 doses issued as against 3,259,616 doses in 1918-19. Out of the above amount, 633,550 doses were issued to the Military Department against 450,700 supplied during the preceding year.

RESEARCH. As mentioned in the two previous years' Annual Reports, shortage of staff, enhanced demand for the. products of this laboratory,. increased routine and adminis- trative duties and paucity of labour and fodder, etc., have immensely contributed to reducing the amount of time that could be devoted to research work. Rinderpest and Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. The same experiments which were in hand during the year 1918-19 regarding infectivity of hides of both of these diseases were continued during the year under report. Johne's Disease. A herd infected with Johne's disease in Bettiah Raj in Bihar was subjected to a test with avian tuberculin. As it was impossible to obtain permis- sion to kill any of the reacting animals, the value of the test could not be determined. Tuberculosis. The experiments foreshadowed in last year's report have been completed and an account of them will be published shortly. Bovine Lymphangitis. With material received from the Madras Presidency, experimental work has been carried out and the causal organism has been isolated. An account of this work is in preparation for publication. Surra. An experiment was initiated on the recommenda- tion of the Surra Committee to ascertain the effects on different animals of the inoculation of strains of the Trypano- soma evansi derived from other species. Some experiments in curative drug treatment were carried out. Publications.

In the second week of September, 1920,I pro- ceeded to Simla for an interview with the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India, and between the 13th and 16th October I saw him again at Bareilly. Between the 13th and 18th January, 1921, and again between the 26th and 30th January, 1921, I visited Delhi to see the Hon'ble Member and the Secretary for Revenue and Agri- culture, and also inspected the serum preparation work at the Branch Laboratory, Bareilly. Between the 21st and 26th February, 1921, I again visited the Branch Laboratory to supervise the serum pre- paration work there. Between the 14th and 19th December, 1920, and again between the 19th and 25th March, 1921, Mr. Doyle visited Bareilly and supervised the serum preparation work at the Branch Laboratory. Training.

Contracts were made for the supply of4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Thirty-five thousand maunds of hay can be taken as the maximum that can conveniently be obtained within a few miles of the laboratory in average years, and this is rather less than the minimum requirements. If any excess is required and must be brought from further afield, the cost will be prohibitive. Thus, this laboratory may now be considered to have reached its maximum development with respect to the number of animals that can be accommodated for use in the preparation of serum and for research purposes. (b) Grain. No difficulty was experienced in obtain- ing grain, but the increase in the cost of transport to Mukte- sar was considerable. More grain storage accommodation is required as with the present facilities the laboratory lives practically from hand to mouth in this respect. Forests. The administration of the forests as in past years was carried on satisfactorily. Owing to the cost of labour it was found absolutely neces- sary to raise the prices of firewood 50 per cent. Compartments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 now under felling were fenced with barbed wire. Cultivation. A start was made at the end of the year to bring more land under cultivation. This is a branch of the farm duties to which more attention will have to be devoted in the future. The isolation of the laboratory from the sources of food supply has resulted in a great increase in the recurrent expenditure : an increase far in excess of that felt by similar institutions which are free from heavy transport expenses from railhead. Every maund of grain and fodder produced locally represents a reduction in expenditure, and though it is un- likely that the laboratory can become self-supporting in this respect, its aim should be to get as near to this goal as possible. Water supply. The additional staff for the upkeep of the new pumps and electric centrifuges was sanctioned and engaged during the year under report.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1921 5 On account of the armature of Pump No. 2 being burnt out during April, 1920, some difficulty was experienced in the water supply during April, May and June. For the following reasons full advantage of the new pumps and water supply cannot be taken :6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, auction at Haldwani and Bareilly, as against a negligible number in previous years. Branch Laboratory. For the preparation of anti-rinder- pest serum and to maintain the rinderpest virus for use in the inoculations by the serum simultaneous method, the Branch Laboratory at Kurgaina (Bareilly) was opened early in October, 1920. As in previous years, a number of grass chuppers (sheds) were erected for the accommodation of animals. The total output was 1,054,955 doses as against 1,124,816 doses during 1919-20. The decrease was due to the closing down of serum production by the end of February or three weeks earlier than in previous years. This was necessary, because, in the absence of cold storage, serum produced after the onset of the warm weather is apt to become contaminated and useless, and this had occurred during the last two years. The question of utilizing the Izatnagar site at Bareilly has again been reopened, as the Kurgaina site is very unsuitable. Experience has shown that in the circumstances in which the Muktesar laboratory works, it is essential to have a branch laboratory at Bareilly to act as a feeder. The branch laboratory can also conveniently augment the supply of serum during the cold weather months. By drawing on the parent laboratory for a nucleus trained staff and by entertaining temporary men locally, about ten lakhs of doses of rinderpest serum can be prepared at one-third of the cost of production at Muktesar. Thus each laboratory is complementary to the other. Financial aspect, The receipts from the sale of the laboratory products during the year 1920-21 amounted to Rs. 369,666-9-7* against Rs. 384,396-4-11 realized during the year 1919-20. These receipts together with a sum of Rs. 83,147-2-0, the cost of the products supplied to the Military Department, come to Rs. 452,813-11-7. The total value of all products prepared during the year under report is Rs. 568,830-6-0 against Rs. 495,228-6-0 for products actually prepared in the previous year. General remarks. No epidemic of a serious nature occurred amongst the labour during the year under report. A few cases of influenza were reported during the winter but the outbreak was of a mild type and was soon brought under control. * This amount includes Rs. 12,466-10-0 realized out of the arrears of the previous year, Bills amounting to Rs. 25,144-1-0 are still due.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1921 7 Owing to the isolation of the laboratory, transport difficulties will last until the ropeway from Kathgodam is constructed. The cost of transport has gone up 25 per cent. over the previous year and 90 per cent. over the pre-war rate. As all commodities are obtained from the plains, the enhancement in cost all-round is thus doubly felt. The paucity of quarters for the accommodation of the subordinate staff was keenly felt and the makeshift arrange- ments effected are far from satisfactory. In February, 1921, the Government of India sanctioned Rs. 10,000 to be utilized in providing temporary quarters for certain members of the staff. To a certain extent this will relieve the situa- tion and discontentment The reorganization of the serum-making department mentioned in last year's annual report has more than justified the means adopted. The additional expenditure involved has been negligible, and in the first year an increase of 25 per cent. in the serum production at Muktesar has resulted. This represents a substantial increase in revenue with a negligible increase in expenditure. The full fruits have not yet been derived, and it is hoped that an even greater im- provement will be shown in the future. All the dressers, except five, very inadvisedly struck work on the 16th June, 1920. They however realized that they had been foolish and returned to work on the 16th July, 1920. This strike threw a great strain on the whole staff of the laboratory and they responded loyally with the result that full production was maintained throughout. My thanks are due to the whole staff of the laboratory for the whole-hearted way they worked throughout the year. I wish especially to place on record the good services rendered by8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, II. PREPARATION OF SERA AND VACCINES. Rinderpest serum. During the year 1920-21, 3,631,940 doses of anti-rinderpest serum were prepared as against 3,189,736 doses prepared during the preceding year, and 3,126,136 doses issued against 2,813,733 doses in the previous year. Out of the above amount, 408,810 doses were issued to the Military Department against 633,550 doses supplied during the year 1919-20. The results of inoculations in the field with anti-rinder- pest serum are shown in the following table :MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1921 9 It is reported in the Annual Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, Punjab, for the year 1919-20 :10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, maintain a good stock, the laboratory would be able to distribute its work more evenly. At the same time it is evident from the above extracts from Annual Reports that a supply of 36 lakhs of doses will not be sufficient for long, and the question of starting a new laboratory in South India, in addition to the branch laboratory at Bareilly, will have to be decided soon. Anthrax serum. Twenty thousand six hundred and twenty-one doses of this serum were prepared during the year under report against 15,867 doses prepared during 1919-20 and 31,613 doses issued against 15,637 issued during the previous year. The subjoined table shows the results of inoculations in the field with anti-anthrax serum :MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1921 11 Haemorrhagic Septicaemia serum and vaccine. During the year under report, 216,276 doses of hæmorrha- gic septicæmia serum and 126,200 doses of hæmorrhagic septicæmia vaccine were prepared and 106,528 doses of serum and 126,200 of vaccine were issued as against 52,399 doses of hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum and 110,500 doses of vaccine prepared and 119,633 doses of serum and 110,500 doses of vaccine issued during the preceding year.

During the year under report, 87,533 doses of mallein were prepared and 88,528 doses issued against 163,735 doses prepared and 164,120 doses issued during the year 1919-20. Of the amount issued, 82,245 doses were supplied to the Military Department. Tuberculin. Six hundred and fourteen doses of tuber- culin were prepared and issued during the year 1920-21 against 1,120 doses prepared and issued during the preceding year. Strangles serum and vaccine. During the year under report, 24,516 doses of anti-strangles serum and 536 doses of strangles vaccine were prepared and 666 doses of serum and 536 doses of vaccine issued against 7,341 doses of strangles serum and 1,136 doses of vaccine prepared and 4,447 doses of serum and 1,136 doses of vaccine issued during the year 1919-20. In addition to the above, 3,800 doses of mixed (anti- streptococcic and staphylococcic) vaccine were prepared and issued during the year against 4,432 doses prepared and issued in the previous year. The above quantity was all supplied to the Military Department. Miscellaneous vaccines. Nine hundred doses of auto- genous vaccines were also prepared and issued during the year 1920-21 from material received at the laboratory against 550 doses prepared and issued in the preceding year.

ANNUAL REPORT OF The Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31st MARCH, 1922. (J. T. EDWARDS, B.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.) I. ADMINISTRATION. Staff. Mr. W. A. Pool, M.R.C.V.S., undertook the duties of officiating Director and First Bacteriologist in ad- dition to those of his post (officiating Second Bacteriologist) until the 18th November, 1921, and I assumed charge of the duties of the appointment substantively on the following day. Messrs. S. C. J. Bennett, B. Sc. (Vet. Sci. London), M.R.C.V.S., and Hugh Cooper, M.R.C.V.S., who had been appointed Second Bacteriologist and Pathologist, res- pectively, by the Secretary of State for India, landed at Bombay on the 26th February, 1922, and arrived at Muk- tesar on the 6th March, 1922. Prior to their arrival in India they had been deputed to undergo a two months' course of instruction at the Veterinary Research Labora- tory of the Union of South Africa, at Onderstepoort, near Pretoria, under the direction of Sir Arnold Theiler, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., Director of Veterinary Education and Research, Union of South Africa. Mr. Bennett thereupon relieved Mr. Pool (officiating Second Bacteriologist), who proceeded on two years' com- bined leave with effect from the 7th March, 1922, with the substantive rank of Veterinary Officer. The post of Pathologist had remained vacant since the date of the resignation of its former substantive occupant, Dr. G. H. K. Macalister, on 1st October, 1917, and on the 6th March, 1922, Mr. Cooper assumed charge of the duties of this appointment.
2 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Mr. T. M. Timoney, M.R.C.V.S., held the post of Third Bacteriologist throughout the year. Mr. T. M. Doyle, F.R.C.V.S., remained in charge of the post of Veterinary Officer until the 4th January, 1922, when he resigned his post to take up an appointment under the Egyptian Government. Mr. W. A. Pool was transfer- red substantively to the post of Veterinary Officer with effect from the 6th March, 1922. Mr. D. Keiller returned from combined leave extending over a period of one year and resumed charge of his duties as First Laboratory Assistant, Upper Grade, on the 1st December, 1921. Mr. G. P. Goffi, Second Laboratory Assistant, Upper Grade, was granted 13 months' combined leave with effect from the 5th November, 1921. His duties during this period were allocated to the First and Third Laboratory Assistants, Upper Grade, who undertook this work in addi- tion to their own duties. Mr. W. Pryde Watson remained in charge of the post of Engineer. Captain A. J. Hearsey was in charge of the duties of Farm Manager. Mr. J. D'Costa, G.B.V.C., held the post of Veterinary Deputy Superintendent. In July 1921, the sanction of Government was obtained for the general revision of the establishment of the labora- tory with effect from the 1st March, 1921. Since that date there has been a further rise in the prices of ordinary food materials. Owing to the isolation of the laboratory, diffi- culties in connection with labour and transport will conti- nue to remain until they are solved by the institution of some improved transport system between the laboratory and railhead, at Kathgodam, 24 miles distant. It is hoped that the projected ropeway scheme will soon materialize. The housing accommodation of the laboratory still re- presents a serious difficulty. With the rapid growth in the work of the laboratory it is quite easy to see that the build- ing resources of the locality could not compete with the de- mands of the rapid influx of residents in the matter of housing, but since the personnel have become fairly sta- tionery in numbers this difficulty has been largely over-
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 3 taken, and there is now considerably less discontentment with regard to this matter. However, in spite of the com- mendable efforts of the Public Works Department, the amount of building that can be executed even when funds are available during any year is limited, and the staff have therefore been enjoined to wait patiently until such time as the difficulty will be eventually completely removed. Tours. Mr. Pool visited the Branch Laboratory at Bareilly between the 22nd and 26th April, 1921, and dur- ing the first week of December, 1921. In the first week in June he proceeded to Simla to attend the Surra Conference and consult the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India. Between the 3rd and 7th August, 1921, he visited Naini Tal to interview the Commissioner of Kumaon Divi- sion and the Deputy Commissioners of Naini Tal, Almora and Garhwal with regard to the supply of " hill" bulls to the laboratory and also to discuss with them the question of the labour supply of the laboratory. Towards the end of April, 1921, Mr. Doyle visited Naini Tal to attend a conference held at the Deputy Com- missioner's Court for the purpose of making arrangements to ameliorate the transport problem in the neighbouring hill country. Early in November he proceeded to Bareilly to supervise the work of serum preparation at the Kur- gaina branch laboratory and subsequently visited Lucknow to purchase stores for the use of the laboratory. On the 19th November he left Bareilly to make investigations with regard to the choice of a suitable site in the Madras Presi- dency for preliminary experimental work upon anti-rinder- pest serum production in that part of India. He reached Madras on the 25th November and then visited Coimbatore, Coonoor, Ootacamund, Kavali and Chaintala, and return- ed to Bareilly on the 16th December. He furnished a fav- ourable report upon a site near Coonoor. On his departure from Muktesar he accompanied me to hand over charge of the Kurgaina laboratory and to examine with me the site at Izatnagar, near Bareilly, which is intended to be used in future as the tributary " plains " serum station. Early in January 1922, I visited the Government Cattle Farm at Hissar in the Punjab in order to make certain en- quiries with regard to the outbreak of equine abortion pre- vailing there, and then proceeded to Lahore to interview officers of the Civil Veterinary Department. From the
4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, 4th February to 3rd March, 1922, I remained away from headquarters on the following missions :MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 5 (6) On my way back to Muktesar visited Bareilly to in- spect the serum preparation work at Kurgaina, and make preliminary arrangements with a view to opening up Izatnagar next cold weather. Between the 19th January and 7th March, 1922, Mr. Timoney remained in charge of the serum preparation work at Kurgaina, and in addition carried out certain experi- mental work there under my direction. Mr. G. McElligott, Second Superintendent, Civil Ve- terinary Department, Madras, whose services were placed at the disposal of the laboratory for one month, from 5th July to 7th August, 1921, toured the Garhwal District to investigate the sources of supply of " hill " bulls to the laboratory. As a result of his observations it was found necessary to increase the price given for these animals. Training. Mr. G. McElligott (vide supra) remained at the laboratory for three months, from the 3rd May to 4th July, 1921. Supplies, Transport, and Labour. Fodder and grain. Contracts were made for the sup- ply to Muktesar of 36,500 maunds of hay and 10,000 maunds of mixed pine needles and leaves for bedding. The bedding was supplied in full, but owing to the considerable incendiarism in the forests during the previous year the contractors did not deliver more than 26,000 maunds of hay. The deficiency was made up to some extent by a sup- ply of wheat and barley straw. Arrangements were made with a contractor for the delivery of nearly ten thousand maunds of grain to Muktesar ; this contractor experienced great difficulty in maintaining supplies on account of the marked rise in the market prices of grain during the period of his agreement, but nevertheless he continued to abide by the stipulated terms. The godown accommodation at pre- sent available is most inadequate and precludes the main- tenance of ample stocks to meet emergencies. Animal supplies. 1920 " hill " bulls and 429 plains buffaloes were admitted into the out-kraals for utilization in the manufacture of the various products issued by the laboratory. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining plains animals (chiefly buffaloes, which are now used mainly as serum producers). The arrangement to obtain buffaloes by
6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, contract from Bareilly did not prove satisfactory; conse- quently sanction has been obtained from Government to purchase all the animals required for our work directly from the bazaars and fairs in the United Provinces by our own veterinary staff. Mr. McElligott, Second Superintendent, Civil Veteri- nary Department, Madras, whilst attached on special duty to the laboratory, toured in the interior of Kumaon and Garhwal to interview various contractors who supply hill bulls to the laboratory with regard to the causes of the in- sufficiency in the supplies forthcoming. It was found that the increased prices asked by the cultivators and the lack of accommodation for the animals en route to Muktesar were the chief factors involved, although there was evidence in addition that attempts had been made to induce the con- tractors to discontinue supplies to Muktesar. Arrangements have since been made with two of our chief contractors from Garhwal for the construction and maintenance of " chupper " accommodation for men and cattle en route, in return for which they receive a certain allowance. Land for a parao at Ganai, or Chokhutia, has been purchased and a chupper is being constructed there. Although it is imperative for the continuity of anti- rinderpest serum manufacture to have at hand an ample supply of these highly susceptible hill bulls, it is very important nevertheless not to maintain at great expense within the laboratory area a large number of animals in excess of our current demands ; for, their maintenance costs at the present price of grain and other fodder within a comparatively short period after their admission exceed their initial cost at time of purchase. Hence, an endeav- our is being made to secure a regular supply to the labora- tory by arranging special terms with certain substantial contractors. It is necessary to arrange these terms, for at certain seasons the roads along which these animals travel become very difficult and the cost of bringing them here and the mortality en route are increased. A high mortality unfortunately occurred among these animals in the out-kraals, before they were admitted into the inner area for the purposes for which they were pur- chased. This was largely attributable to a virulent out- break of foot-and-mouth disease which continued among them for some months. Owing to the previous shortage in the supplies and the encouragement then given to the con-
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 7 tractors to bring in their animals for fear of a discontinu- ance, very large numbers were admitted into the out-kraals, which became congested, and there was a lack of grazing ground for the animals. Moreover, they were for the most part old and debilitated on arrival, and had suffered from the long journey to the laboratory. These factors contri- buted thus to a mortality of 545 among the hill bulls and 57 among the buffaloes. An endeavour was made to pro- duce an anti-foot-and-mouth disease serum for the preven- tive inoculation of these animals. Every effort is being made to dispose of animals which are no longer serviceable for purposes of serum manufac- ture in the best market. Experience has shown that the period during which cattle can be usefully employed for furnishing a potent anti-rinderpest is somewhat limited, and with continued improvement in the technical process of hyper-immunization it is hoped to reduce the mortality among these animals to a negligible number. As it is to our interest in obtaining a high yield of serum to maintain these animals in the best conditions for health, a consider- able number of discontinued cattle, which will have the added quality of being immune to rinderpest, will be avail- able hence for disposal to cultivators. Unfortunately our efforts in this direction have been hampered for many reasons. In the first place, the hill bulls which we are able to procure for the laboratory are sold to us by their origi- nal owners largely because they are deformed, chronically ill-conditioned, or too old for cultivation work, and it would be difficult to find a suitable market for surviving animals of this class. The male buffaloes employed for serum production are of good quality, but again there ap- pears to be some antipathy among cultivators towards utili- zing them. In order to demonstrate their utility the policy of giving away a certain number to men who would be like- ly to put them to a fair trial has been adopted. Two pairs of buffaloes and three pairs of hill bulls were given to the Superintendent, Tarai and Bhaber Estates, Haldwani, Naini Tal District, but it appears from his reports that the animals seemed to be rather weak for the work demand- ed of them. Four villagers in the Bareilly District were each given a pair of buffaloes free of charge. The use of discontinued rinderpest animals for the pro- duction of sera against other diseases and for certain im- portant experimental work is also being tried.
8 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Out-kraals. The seven large out-kraals stand in need of some improvement and enlargement, and it is hoped that some more small masonry structures will be made available. Just before winter sets in, while the roads are still open, contractors usually bring in large numbers of hill bulls and the question of accommodating them and providing suit- able grazing grounds becomes then acute, and the condi- tions for the spread of contagious disease are intensified. The water supply of the kraals at present depends entirely on natural springs, which are liable to fail during the hot weather, and hence a considerable amount of labour has then to be employed in transporting water from distant springs. More Dutch barn structures are needed, for a large quantity of hay is lost annually through insufficient protection. A properly designed dipping tank is being constructed near the Katula hospital and is near completion. This is much needed for the treatment of buffaloes in particular which often arrive at the station in a mangy condition and remain in an impoverished state owing to this affection. Laboratory supplies and equipment. At times the la- boratory has been greatly inconvenienced by delay in the delivery of chemicals and apparatus due to difficulties in connection with railway and coolie transport. The policy of maintaining all stocks of material required for the needs of the station in a central store has enabled a closer super- vision to be made of all purchases and issues, and it is ex- pected that this arrangement will prove economical. For- merly it was the practice to obtain glassware and other laboratory equipment mainly from Europe. The policy has now been adopted of effecting such purchases as far as possible in India, and, to this end, Directors of Industries have been approached with a view to obtaining the names of manufacturers who are likely to supply the laboratory requirements. Examinations are now being made of the glassware manufactured in the country and it is hoped that our needs in this respect will soon be satisfied. Certain improvements have been made in the equipment for pack- ing and despatching the laboratory products. An appara- tus has been designed for eliminating contamination of plasma, which, used in connection with a recently obtained specially designed metal bleeding vessel, is expected to effect considerable improvement in the serum. A " cap-
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 9 ping " machine has superseded the old corking method of closing bottles. The bottling department was somewhat handicapped by delay in the receipt of serum bottles from Europe, and arrangements were made through a local con- tractor for a supply of beer bottles, which though not of aesthetic appearance serve the purpose remarkably well. Minor but permanent economies were made in connection with the packing and despatch of serum. Forest supplies. During the year under report the total output of the Muktesar forest amounted to 28,540 maunds of fuel wood, 1,305 maunds of charcoal, 4,047 maunds of green grass, 3,795 maunds of green oakleaves (for fodder), and 3,269 maunds of hay. As in previous years the admi nistration of the forest and the utilization of forest resources were carried out according to a prescribed work- ing plan. Owing to a further rise in the cost of labour the price of charcoal had to be slightly increased. During May and June the laboratory staff was kept busy checking attempts at incendiarism. Seeds of pines, Laburnum, Caprissus sempervivens, and Thuya lobbii were sown to form a nursery of young plants wherewith to fill the treeless gaps in the inner laboratory area and around the outer kraals. Laboratory farm supplies. During the year the area under cultivation was increased from 37 to 44 acres. The produce amounted to 1,587 maunds of green fodder (maize, Sorghum, lucerne, and clover), which was ensiled, and about 600 maunds of vegetables, chiefly for the feeding of the small laboratory animals, and for the staff. There are certain factors which operate adversely upon the success of cultivation in the station, namely, the uncertainty of the labour supply during the busy seasons and the diffi- culty of transporting manure, which is available in large quantities in the inner laboratory area and out-kraals, on account of the absence of good roads to the cultivable tracts. Steps are taken to ascertain the best means of economically increasing the productive area to at least 300 acres, and arrangements were made before the close of the year for the inspection of the station by the Imperial Agriculturist. Dairy supplies. The dairy management was under- taken by the farm department during Mr. Goffi's absence on leave. The dairy herd consisted of 22 cows, one stud bull, and 19 calves. The milk supply was sadly deficient
10 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, throughout the year to meet the demands of the residents, and in order to eliminate this possible factor of justifiable discontent, steps have been taken to enlarge and improve the dairy herd. The Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, very kindly handed over to Muktesar, as the result of my representations at Pusa, a very fine specimen of young Ame- rican Holstein bull, and the Imperial Dairy Expert ar- ranged to procure eight additional Karachi cows of good quality. After their arrival the difficulties in connection with the milk supply should cease, and by judicious breed- ing it is hoped that ample milk will be available for the station. Labour. Owing to the exertions and tact of the recruit- ing mates a sufficiency of labour was maintained through- out the year. The labour supply of the laboratory is a pe- culiar one, for owing to the aversions of the local populace towards the menial duties of the laboratory the main mass of the labour is recruited in Doti, 200 miles away. It is the policy of the laboratory to encourage the stay of good labour by allowing suitable periods of leave after a reason- able term of service. Nevertheless the majority of the coolies and cattle attendants (gowallas) represent a fleeting population. The number of farm coolies, namely those em- ployed in out-kraal duties, cultivation and general work, engaged during the year numbered 605. Of these, 524 were discharged or absconded during the period. The average daily attendance was 299. More labour of this class will be required with the development of more exten- sive cultivation. The average daily number of cattle at- tendants (gowallas) employed in the inner sheds, in con- nection with serum making animals, was 167 (the rinder- pest side 127, " experimental " side 40). Transport. The transport problem at the present time represents the most serious impediment to the development of the resources of Muktesar, and the necessity for the materialization of the proposed ropeway scheme, or for the construction of a proper cart road, to connect the station directly or indirectly with railhead (Kathgodam), has now become a cogent economic concern. The present methods of transport are entirely by means of pack animals and coolies. The cost of transport of loads not exceeding one maund in weight from railhead amounts on an average to three rupees a maund. The rates for loads above one
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 11 maund in weight increase proportionately and attain as much as twenty rupees per maund for loads from 10 to 15 maunds in weight. The transport of laboratory stores both ways is undertaken by a contractor, while the cost of transport is included in the price of grain delivered at Muktesar by the grain contractors. The supply of labour for transport is extremely erratic, and at times ceases for some weeks, with the result that laboratory stores have to remain at railhead for a considerable time and hence are often found perished through exposure and rough handling on arrival subsequently at Muktesar. The loss incurred through leakage of kerosine oil tins represents a serious item yearly. The approximate annual weight of stores transported between Muktesar and railhead annually comes to nearly *twenty-seven thousand maunds, and at Rs. 3 per maund the expenditure on transport, paid either by the contractor or by the laboratory directly, amounts to Rs. 81,000. To this a sum might be added Rs. 30,000 which represents the cost of transport of 40,000 maunds of grass, at an average rate of 12 annas per maund, procured from an area within a radius of 10 miles of Muktesar. It is anticipated that a large proportion of this forage could be obtained at a comparatively low rate from points along the suggested improved routes of communication. Transport within the laboratory area. The daily weight of rations transported from the Farm Godown to the various out-kraals amounts to an average of nearly 37 maunds, and is undertaken by coolies and ponies. It is therefore calculated that at the present time any system of mechanical transport would be too expensive when com- pared with the cost of hand labour. Nevertheless, the in- creased cost could be met to some extent by increased deve- lopment of cultivation. Power house department. The output of the water supply system and gas plant of the laboratory was increas-. ed as compared with the previous year. No inconvenience was experienced in the inner laboratory area due to defi- cient water supply, although the winter of 1921-22 had been very mild, without much rain and snowfall, and the * Grain . . . . 20,000 mds. Kerosine, crude and lubricating oils . . . . 1,900 12 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, summer of the year under report was unusually warm. Pumping operations had to be continued daily for long hours owing to the limited engine power available. No trouble was experienced with the gas plant, and the regu- larity and quality of the gas supply to the laboratory shows a very satisfactory improvement. A considerable reduction was effected by the engineer in the quantity of kerosine oil used in gas production, by using waste lubricating oil, which previously used to be thrown away, mixed with crude oil, to which was added a certain percentage of kerosine oil. The new electric centrifuges continued to run satis- factorily and no breakdowns occurred. There was a re- duced consumption of current used by the centrifuge motors, amounting to 1,436 units, due to decrease in the quantity of blood centrifuged as compared with the preced- ing year. The shortage of engine power in the laboratory has be- come an urgent problem, and considerable apprehension is felt with regard to the occurrence of a possible breakdown in the existing arrangements. The Hornsby oil engine in the power house was run for long periods every day during the dry period, from February to June, and considerable difficulty was found by the engineering staff in finding time to clean and overhaul the engine, and- supply the other needs of the laboratory. The staff had to work daily, holi- days included, for 10 to 12 hours during this period. The principal engine spare parts, ordered in 1920 through the Public Works Department, have not yet arrived, and are urgently required in order to maintain regular and effi- cient running. Steps have been taken to exploit the pos- sibilities of installing a hydro-electric power scheme with all practicable speed. With the further development of the technical resources of the laboratory it will be neces- sary to obtain an ample supply of cheap power. The recur- ring expenditure upon fuel for oil engines, the cost of which at the station is very heavy owing to the steadily in- creasing transport rates and the leakage en route, consti- tutes an impediment to the development of the station as a manufactory for certain products on a large scale. Pre- liminary investigations seem to indicate that there is suffi- cient water power in the vicinity of the laboratory to meet all the computed demands of the institution for many years. The engineer has examined a stream situated two and a half miles away from the laboratory which is
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 13 calculated to produce over twenty times the power annually utilized hitherto in the laboratory. A preliminary scheme to harness 285,000 units annually is being drawn up, and is being carefully checked before presentation. In addition to their current duties, the engineer and his staff rendered invaluable aid in constructing or modifying mechanical devices required by the veterinary technical workers of the laboratory. Medical and sanitary arrangements. No epidemic of a serious nature occurred among the laboratory personnel during the year under report. Relapsing fever, which in former years had occasionally caused considerable disloca- tion of work by its appearance among the menial staff, did not occur save in two very small oubreaks ; one of these occurred in our workmen who live in an adjoining village, but thanks to the prompt and efficacious methods of control adopted by Assistant Surgeon Ratish Chandra Banerji, the disease was extinguished before it had a chance to obtain a hold on the station. In order to guard against rapid trans- mission of this disease effective methods of ridding the menials of the vector were actively carried out in a regular periodic manner by the Assistant Surgeon. A few cases of influenza appeared but caused no undue alarm. The ques- tion of sanitation represents an exceptionally important problem in this place, on account of its topography, the nature of work, and the peculiarities of the residents re- cruited for the work. The Assistant Surgeon made most meritorious endeavours to solve this difficulty, but it is con- sidered that the proper execution of the necessary duties in this connection represents sufficient work for a fully trained sanitary inspector. Library. The number of professional periodicals taken regularly by the library amount to 98, the number of bound volumes of journals is 3,059, the number of text-books pur- chased up to the present 1,189, reports received up to the present 998, and pamphlets 663. The library is perhaps the most complete in any veterinary institution in the British Empire, and steps have been taken to place it in such order that it may readily serve the needs of the profes- sion in India. For this purpose it requires competent super- vision and some additional recurring expenditure in keep- ing it well stocked with all the current relevant literature.
14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Branch laboratory. The branch laboratory at Kurgai- na (Bareilly) was, as in former years, opened early in October. Temporary grass chuppers were erected for the accommodation of animals. A number of hill bulls were transferred to the Izatnagar site at Bareilly for want of sufficient accommodation at Muktesar. The Kurgaina laboratory was utilized as a factory for the production of anti-rinderpest serum until the beginning of March. The total output of serum amounted to 1,292,381 (5 c.c.) " doses." One large quantity of serum (265,000 doses) prepared towards the close of the season was discarded, as it was found to be of low potency when subjected to a test and it was somewhat grossly contaminated with micro- organisms. The latter fault might have been obviated if there had been a cold storage installation at Bareilly, while the low potency would be attributable to the circumstance that the serum was obtained from producers which had been in use throughout the season. The Kurgaina site presents certain grave disadvantages as a serum station and these reside mainly in the fact that it lies near a much frequented main thoroughfare and hence there is some risk of accidental spread of rinderpest, and the area is too restricted for the proper accommodation of animals and for future expansion. Having this in mind the late Colonel Holmes, when he was Director of this labo- ratory, took steps to acquire about 700 acres of suitable land at Izatnagar near Bareilly and for some years certain residential quarters have been erected on the site. He had also in mind the development of the branch laboratory as a tributary research centre where work could be carried out in the winter months. Although for the prosecution of modern research work on disease, which necessitates the un- remitting attention of the worker throughout all seasons of the year, Muktesar possesses incomparable advantages in most respects, yet for certain kinds of investigation the pos- session of a suitable research centre at a convenient distance on the plains forms an essential complement to the Muktesar laboratory. Moreover, for the cheap massive production of serum during a certain part of the year a " plains " labo- ratory situated at such a place as Izatnagar presents strik- ing economical advantages, and it is hoped by the installa- tion of suitable cooling apparatus, by the exploitation of various methods of desiccating serum on a large scale, and developing the agricultural resources of Izatnagar to place
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 15 it on such a footing that it will eliminate some of the heavy items of expenditure at present inseparable from the utili- zation of the Muktesar laboratory as a serum factory. Steps are being taken to open up the Izatnagar site during the next cold weather. Finances. During the year under report the receipts from the sale of laboratory products amounted to Rs. 4,39,459-13-9*, to which may be added Rs. 34,303 which represents the value of products supplied to the Army Department free of charge. The total thus amounts to Rs. 4,73,762-13-9, against Rs. 4,52,813-11-7 in the previous year. The revenue derived from the sale of the laboratory pro- ducts will increase substantially in future years, as with effect from the 1st April, 1922, the Government of India has revised the rates to be charged for these products in accord- ance with the estimated increased expenditure now entailed in their manufacture. In addition, the laboratory will charge for supplies indented by the Army Department. General remarks. In conclusion, I wish to place on re- cord my appreciation of the remarkable goodwill and loyal- ty displayed by all members of the staff. I have to thank in particular :16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Finally, I must express my gratitude to Mr W. A. Pool who communicated to me freely all the experience he had gained during the period he had officiated as Director of the institution, and whose earnest work, often in somewhat try- ing circumstances, enabled the institution to cope, with un- precedented success, with the increased demands that were made upon it for sera. Without his liberal advice when I took over charge, I would have found it extremely hard to grasp the peculiar difficulties attached to the working of this institution. II. PREPARATION AND ISSUE OF SERA AND VACCINES. A summary of the results reported from the use of these products in the field is tabulated in Appendix I. Anti-rinderpest serum forms the staple product of the laboratory. The total quantity produced was 2,720,057 (5 c. c.) doses as against 3,631,940 doses prepared during the year 1920-21; 2,930,601 doses were issued as against 3,126,136 in the preceding year. The manufacture of this serum has now overtaken demands and there was in stock at the end of the year 864,000 doses. The demand was 195,535 doses less than in the preceding year, and the decrease is represented largely by a falling-off in the indents received from the Military Department, which obtained 146,521 doses only in 1921-22, as against 408,810 in 1920- 21. Except for some unforeseen occurrence it is, therefore, anticipated that the combined resources of Muktesar and Bareilly will be sufficient for some time to meet the capaci- ties of the veterinary personnel throughout India in apply- ing serum treatment in the field. The reports of the Pro- vincial Departments continue to show an increased ten- dency on the part of cattle owners to allow their animals to be inoculated as a means of prevention against rinderpest, and the following quotation from the forward- ing letter of the Secretary to the Development Com- missioner, Burma, covering the Report of the Civil Veterinary Department, for the year ended 31st March, 1921, is significant, ".......severe outbreaks of rinderpest, resulting in 31,921 deaths, occurred in Upper Burma.....Animals were inoculated in 659 out- breaks, and only 377 animals, out of 69,785 inoculated, died. The continued success of inoculation as a means of reducing cattle mortality cannot fail to impress itself, in
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 17 the course of time, on the minds of simple villagers, innate- ly suspicious of all change, and signs are not lacking that their conservatism is slowly being broken down by the re- peated demonstration of the efficacy of inoculation." How- ever, it is not pretended that serum alone represents an elixir the mere exhibition of which in an outbreak of rinder- pest wards off all danger. The limitations of serum treat- ment, which confers a transient, passive immunity, have been well discussed in a memoir by Messrs. Pool and Doyle, of this laboratory, now in the press. Nevertheless, when applied early in the course of a visitation in combination with well-devised methods of segregation there can be no doubt as to its supreme efficacy. The following excerpt from the above-mentioned report (p. 9) indicates that in some parts this procedure is well appreciated. " In most of the districts where cattle disease is an annual visitation there is no doubt that people have learnt from past experi- ence the value of segregation and in such places co-operation has produced most satisfactory results. The Sub-division- al Officer, Prome, remarks that ' the low mortality this year is due to prompt information of the outbreak of cattle disease, the immediate visit of the Assistant to the spot affected, and the help and co-operation of the headmen in enforcing segregation and cattle disease rules. The disease in most cases was localized and stamped out before it could spread to the neighbouring villages.' " It would seem that despite the fragility of the virus, the only sure preventive against the disease in a country where segregation measures cannot be effectually enforced is the wide-spread active im- munization of the bovine population so as to render them subsequently immune for the remainder of their lives against attack. It is surprising to what a small extent this method of immunization has been practised in India, and the explanation must reside in the fear of attendant un- toward results that might arouse the revulsion of owners towards all inoculation. Where the method has been adopt- ed regularly, as in the Military Dairies, it has been eminent- ly successful, and the Controller declares (verbal communi- cation) that the diseases affecting his herds are now reduced to those which obtain among milch herds in temperate coun- tries. The case for active immunization has been well pleaded in the above memoir (by Messrs. Pool and Doyle), and every endeavour is now being made at the laboratory to exploit some safe and sure method of conferring a perma- B 2
18 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, nent immunity in this manner, and the best means of pro- pagating its wide-spread employment in the field. There appear to be no complaints from the provinces with regard to insufficiency of serum, but the chief local difficulty seems to be the transport of the serum to the re- mote places where it is often required. The adequacy of the supplies may be attributed in no small measure to the reorganization of the serum-making department by Mr. Pool during his tenure of office. Anti-anthrax serum. 47,206 doses of this product were prepared during the year as against 20,621 in 1920-21 ; 32,600 doses were issued as against 31,613 in the previous year. The remarks concerning the use of rinderpest serum would apply in a large measure to this serum, and as there is evidence that in certain districts anthrax may assume the form of an epizootic during certain seasons and the en- forcement of prompt reporting by some legislative measure would probably disclose a wider prevalence than is depicted by available statistics, steps are being taken at the labora- tory to manufacture a suitable " spore " vaccine, which can be placed at the disposal of the veterinary services in combating outbreaks in notoriously infected districts. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia serum and vaccine. During the year, 107,513 doses of serum and 115,050 doses of vac- cine were prepared, and 177,418 doses of serum and 115,050 doses of vaccine were issued. In the preceding year 216,276 doses of serum and 126,200 doses of vaccine were prepared and 106,528 doses of serum and 126,200 doses of vaccine were issued. For some time prior to his departure on leave efforts were made by Mr. Pool to standardize the efficacy of these products. In view of the publication of results which seem to indicate the existence of, antigenically or serologi- cally, different strains of the casual organism, much further work is contemplated upon these products. Black-quarter vaccine. 35,000 doses of vaccine were prepared and 32,864 issued as against nil prepared, and 30,900 issued during the previous year. Attempts were made to prepare a liquid (filtrate) vaccine at the laboratory. The preparation of products to combat the affection known as black-quarter in cattle now needs some revision, in view of the very recent work done elsewhere in the world point- ing to a somewhat multiple causal origin of the condition,.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE YEAR ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1922 19 and to the now known means published of producing safe and effective protective agents. Mallein. During the year 1921-22, 47,144 doses of mallein were prepared and issued as against 87,533 doses prepared and 88,528 doses issued in 1920-21. 41,050 doses were issued to the Military Department. This represents a considerable falling-off in the demands of this department, which amounted to 82,245 doses in 1920-21. Tuberculin. 2,054 doses of tuberculin were prepared and 2,066 doses issued during the year, as against 614 doses prepared and issued in the previous year. Strangles serum and vaccine. During the year under report the necessity did not arise for preparing more strangles serum as the demands were complied with from the stock in hand. 10,277 doses of serum were issued, against 666 doses in the preceding year. 275 doses of vac- cine were prepared and issued as compared with 536 doses prepared and issued during the year 1920-21. In addition to the above, 240 doses of mixed anti-strep- tococcic and staphylococcic vaccine were prepared and issu- ed as against 3,800 doses prepared and issued during the previous year. A table showing amounts of various products prepared and issued as compared with average amounts of the last five years is given in Appendix II. III. EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS. The number of pathological specimens received for examination during the year was 388. The greater number of these specimens represent material received for the sero- logical diagnosis of contagious abortion. (Details concern- ing these specimens are given in Appendix III.) The num- ber of specimens received is very small when account is taken of the fact that the laboratory is the premier institu- tion in India for the investigation of live-stock conditions. The paucity of specimens is probably largely attributable to a prevailing impression that the laboratory is too remote to serve as a diagnostic centre, and hence is placed at a disad- vantage in rendering assistance in this direction to the vete- rinary services in the field. This impression appears to be largely erroneous, for in a country where distances are wide
20 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, an additional day's journey need not interfere materially with the condition of specimens if in the first place they are properly collected and preserved. The laboratory would welcome further calls of this nature upon its services, as there is undoubtedly a great deal of investigation work upon economically important conditions that could be done in this manner, and a museum of Indian morbid specimens of pathological interest from animals needs creation. Steps have been taken to ascertain the practicability of distribu- ting ready prepared receptacles for the conveyance of speci- mens for histological and bacteriological diagnoses, and it is hoped that funds may be forthcoming for the purchase of what are now considered to be suitable articles, which will be distributed among the field veterinary personnel in India with the necessary instructions for taking the morbid material. IV. RESEARCH. For the greater part of the year the higher technical staff was limited to the officiating Director, Third Bacte- riologist and Veterinary Officer, and hence the resources of the laboratory for research were restricted in view of the contingent demands of administration and routine serum and vaccine manufacture. Nevertheless valuable work was performed by the officiating Director in collaboration with the Veterinary Officer in obtaining further knowledge with regard to anti-rinderpest serum, the classes of bovines from which it could be prepared, methods of estimating its poten- cy, and the duration and character of the immunity follow- ing upon inoculation with it. The Veterinary Officer, moreover, performed a series of interesting investigations upon the infective agent of equine contagious abortion. A good deal of patient work was done by Mr. Pool upon hæ- morrhagic septicæmia in cattle. With the accession of a full complement of technical officers to the staff, the re- sources of the institution were reorganized for immediate development, and wherever it was found that the Indian veterinary inspectors possessed any aptitude for investiga- tion they were taken as co-workers of the trained staff. In this way, it is hoped that the maximum output may. be ob- tained from the efforts of the higher technical officers, while in the meantime the young Indian assistants may become inculcated with the methods of research and will be avail-

It is thus expected that the best material of the colleges will aspire to enter the institution, when it is known that routine bleeding and supervision of menials no longer forms the highest or the most desirable qualifications expected of them. Rinderpest. A series of large scale experiments are in progress upon the biological characteristics of the rinder- pest virus ; work in this direction is deemed to be of primary importance inasmuch as rinderpest comes first in economic interest among the conditions that need further elucidation, and recently elaborated technical laboratory processes which appear to have been productive of striking advances in knowledge in regard to similar infectious diseases else- where stand in need of application to solve many undeter- mined characteristics of the casual agent of this condition. The facilities obtainable at this laboratory are unique for the study of epizootiological problems of this kind. Surra and other protozoan diseases. Next in economic importance comes the further study of surra and other pro- tozoan diseases which are receiving the attention of the staff. A systematic examination of all available material has been instituted, and in the matter of the piroplasm parasites of cattle this work soon yielded striking results. A prolonged series of researches are being planned in re- gard to surra with the object mainly of ascertaining which of the trypanocidal agents claimed to have rendered benefi- cial results in treatment represent the most economical and easily applicable in field conditions. Contagious abortion. The methods of controlling con- tagious abortion in mares and donkeys are being systemati- cally studied in conjunction with the Superintendent of the Hissar Cattle Farm. Sheep disease. The nature of certain outbreaks of sheep disease in Southern India are being studied in the laboratory. Mange. In view of the amount of mange material available the efficacy of various acaricidal agents is being tested, and results of considerable practical importance are expected. Strangles. In conjunction with the Army Department material from cases of strangles is being investigated and

The investigation work indicated under the section on the preparation of sera and vaccines is being undertaken as far as possible concurrently with the routine work of the laboratory. Minor investigations. A number of problems of minor importance are also engaging the attention of the staff, and in particular the pathological department is engaged in the systematic collection and study of the large amount of mor- bid material which becomes available daily. V. INSTRUCTION. In view of the facilities obtainable at the institution for the study of epizootiological problems, the fact that the most important epizootic conditions of the live-stock in India are close at hand, the wealth of morbid material, the well-equipped laboratories, the salubrity of the climate which enables uninterrupted study, the resources of Mukte- sar seem to be unrivalled for the teaching of the practical methods of investigating contagious live-stock disease. Schemes of education for the training of officers of subor- dinate grade selected for promotion to the Imperial Branch of the Service, and for systematic short courses of instruc- tion for officers of the Army and Civil Veterinary Depart- ment have been submitted to Government, and preparations are made for the inception of these courses in 1922-23.

Ganguly, Assistant Engineer, officiating during his absence. Farm Manager. Captain A. J. Hearsey. Veterinary Deputy Superintendent. Mr. J. D'Costa. Granted leave on average pay for 4 months and 20 days with effect from 11th November, 1922, Khan Sahib Wazir Mohammed, Veterinary Inspector, officiating during his absence. Tours undertaken by the Staff. During the cold weather of both years a considerable amount of touring was done by the staff in order to under- take studies of animal disease in India under field conditions and pro- pagate the influence of the laboratory. During the cold weather season 1922-23, the Director appeared to give evidence before the Inchcape Committee upon Retrenchment in Expenditure at Delhi on 17th January, 1923, and thence proceeded to Lahore to consult the Principal, Punjab Veterinary College, regarding arrangements for the Second Meeting of Imperial Veterinary Officers in India. This Meeting, of which he was Secretary, was held at Calcutta from the 22nd February to 2nd March, 1923. From the 1st to 11th February, 1923, he visited the Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, to attend the 5th Entomological Conference, arrange for demonstrations to be given to officers under training at Muktesar there, and supervise the inoculation against rinderpest of the herd in charge of the Imperial Agriculturist. Further, in company with the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India (Mr. S. Milligan), he proceeded to Bareilly to draw up a scheme for the development of the Izatnagar site and thence to Delhi to present the matter with him to the Government of India. The President of the Second Meeting of Veteri- nary Officers in India (Col. G. K. Walker) was further consulted at Lahore with regard to the final draft of the report of the meeting. Again, during the cold weather 1923-24, nearly three months were spent altogether away from headquarters, in which visits were paid to headquarters of Government of India at Delhi, to Meerut, Saharanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Jubbulpore, and Ahmednagar to consult officers of the Army Veterinary Service in India with regard to disease subjects under in- vestigation (notably contagious abortion in mares and cattle, strangles, bursattee, kumri), to Patna, Lucknow, Agra, and Lahore to consult officers of the Civil Veterinary Department (notably with regard to instructional matters, kumri, surra, and infectious nasal granuloma of cattle) and to Pusa to consult the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India (Mr. S. Milligan) with regard to administrative matters and the Imperial Entomologist (Mr. T. Bambrigge Fletcher) with a view to securing assistance in regard to the investigation of the insect transmis- sion of certain diseases. Prolonged visits were paid to the Izatnagar branch laboratory to superintend the work of serum manufacture. Mr. Bennett, the Second Bacteriologist, was ordered to proceed to Bareilly to supervise serum manufacture at Izatnagar in December, 1922, and make there certain observations upon surra. He visited Lucknow
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 3 in January, 1923, to make enquiries in regard to contagious abortion among cattle at the Government Military Dairy, and later visited Pusa (28th January to 24th February) to inoculate the important herd of cattle there against rinderpest, make certain investigations in regard to the safety of the serum simultaneous method of inoculation against this disease, and conduct the officers under training deputed there for practi- cal demonstrations. He was further ordered to accompany these officers, at the end of their course, around certain institutions in the Punjab in which work of direct importance in connection with the live-stock industry in India could be demonstrated to them (beginning of November to end of December, 1923); he also performed rinderpest inoculations at the Government Military Dairies at Lahore, Ferozepore, and Ambala in order to test the efficacy of the serum issued for this purpose during the 1923-24 season, and was instructed to remain in the Punjab to investigate, with the assistance of Mr. Torabaz Khan, the incidence of infection and clinical affection due to the causal agent of the common form of bovine contagious abortion among indigenous cattle under field condi- tions until the end of March, 1924. Mr. Timoney, the Third Bacteriologist, proceeded to Pusa in February, 1923, to present his paper upon mange in buffaloes before the Fifth Ento- mological Conference. He was deputed to Izatnagar from 11th February, 1924, to repeat certain experiments upon the chemo-therapy of surra. Mr. Cooper, the Pathologist, proceeded to Calcutta in November, 1923, to obtain information with regard to certain important disease conditions in horses ; thence he proceeded to Bangalore to attend the meeting of the Indian Science Congress, the Thirteenth Meeting of the Board of Agriculture in India, and further undertook the immunization of the herd of cattle at the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry and Dairying at Bangalore and at the Government Dairy Farm at Wellington and made important observations upon complications arising in animals undergoing this treatment. On his return he interviewed the Principal, Madras Veterinary College, and the Director, Indian Museum, Calcutta, in regard to technical matters. Mr. Brett, while he was officiating Veterinary Officer, toured the Almora and Garhwal Districts during May and June, 1922, to investigate the sources of hill bull supplies and make arrangements for securing deliveries. He was in charge of serum production at Izatnagar from the end of October to the end of December, 1922, and made tours for the purchase of animals in the neighbourhood. Mr. Haddow, after taking up the duties of Veterinary Officer, remained in charge of serum preparation work at Izatnagar throughout the cold weather season (November-March) 1923-24. During his stay there he paid visits to Lucknow and Sitapur in January to supervise the work of inoculating cattle at the Government Military Dairies against rinder- pest. Mr. Watson, the Engineer, visited Kathgodam in June, 1922, to arrange for the transport of the heavy parts of the two steam boilers
4 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, and large sterilizers to Muktesar, and visited Bareilly in February, 1923, to supervise the making of castings of missing parts of this plant. He paid visits to the Izatnagar laboratory in January and February, 1924, to arrange for repairs to laboratory appliances and prepare a scheme for an adequate water supply. II. ADMINISTRATION. (a) Fodder and grain. During the year 1922-23, contracts were placed for the supply to the Muktesar laboratory of 39,000 maunds of hay and 6,000 maunds of pine needles and leaves for bedding. The bedding was supplied in full quantity, but owing to the severe winter of the year, with frequent heavy snowfalls, and the shortage of labour, the contractors could not deliver more than 29,000 maunds of hay. An attempt was made to make good the deficiency by feeding animals on hay substitutes such as oak leaves and wheat and barley straw as far as possible when these products were procurable. During the year 1923-24, arrangements were made for increasing the proportion of serum-manufacturing work to be undertaken during the cold weather at Izatnagar and hence contracts were made for the supply of smaller quantities of hay to Muktesar (25,000 maunds at Rs. 1-2 per maund from the outside forest areas, and 3,500 maunds at 12 As. per maund from the laboratory estate, small quantities of partly dry grass obtainable from the forests during October to be delivered at 14 As. per maund). The winter season during the year was a very mild one in the hills and the contractor was able to command adequate labour ; hence the full quantity contracted for was obtainable from the outside areas, but he could collect only 2,611 maunds from the laboratory area. During the year 1922-23, arrangements were made with two con- tractors at Haldwani for the delivery of nearly 15,000 maunds of grain at Muktesar. They fulfilled their agreement in a very satisfactory manner, and the anxiety in respect of supplies of this very important commodity experienced during the preceding year was dissipated. Again, for the same reasons as were stated in dealing with the hay supplies, arrange- ments were made for the delivery of smaller quantities of grain (7,740 maunds) to Muktesar during the year 1923-24. The contractor effected deliveries in an eminently satisfactory manner. Steps have been taken in conjunction with the Public Works Depart- ment to draw up plans and estimates for more ample godown accommoda- tion for the storage of grain, the building to be situated at the terminus of the projected branch ropeway to Muktesar. The need for more room for the storage of grain is still sorely felt, but schemes for provision of our requirements in this respect have had to suffer on account of the pre- vailing financial stringency. The requirements of the Izatnagar branch laboratory were met during the cold weather season 1922-23 by arrangement with a contractor to deliver supplies of grain and hay at official price current rates. About
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 5 1,350 maunds of grain and 5,000 maunds of hay were purchased in this manner, but great difficulty was experienced in obtaining hay of the desired quality. During the season 1923-24, owing to the increase in the programme for serum manufacture, tenders were called for antici- pated requirements, and arrangements were made with contractors for the delivery of 4,650 maunds of grain and 15,000 maunds of hay. In addition, a local contractor to whom the portions of the estate not required at present for laboratory work were leased was requested to deliver 575 maunds of grain in lieu of rent. The grain contractor was, however, only required to supply about 2,800 maunds for the working season, and did his work very well. It is hoped in time that the laboratory will be able to take over the working of the estate so as to ensure ample supplies of good fodder for the serum making animals there, and plans for effecting the necessary rearrangements in the staffing of the laboratory so as to realize this most necessary economic desideratum will be submitted shortly to Government. (b) Animal supplies. During the year 1922-23, 2,245 hill bulls, 18 hill buffaloes, and 150 plains buffaloes were purchased and admitted for use into the out-kraals at Muktesar. Of these hill bulls, 463 were des- patched for use at Izatnagar during the winter season, and 276 plains buffaloes were purchased for use as serum-makers there. During the year 1923-24, 3,423 hill bulls and 233 hill buffialoes were purchased for use and admitted into the out-kraals at Muktesar. Of the hill bulls, 1,140 were despatched to Izatnagar for use there during the winter season, and 652 plains buffaloes were purchased for use as serum-makers. In regard to hill bulls the system of purchase was entirely revised. In the first place, considerable interference with the work of producing an efficacious anti-rinderpest serum and with the course of experimenta- tion upon rinderpest had been experienced during recent years owing to the fact that the animals purchased as hill bulls frequently displayed a disturbingly high degree of resistance against the disease. There appears to have taken place through the seasonal migrations of the hill inhabi- tants to the plains at the foot of the hills a very distinct intermingling of " plains " blood with the normal bovine population of the hills, which had always been regarded as a race or kind of cattle extremely susceptible to rinderpest and therefore most useful for furnishing " virus " in the hyperimmunization of serum-makers. After a little experience, one has little difficulty in recognizing the external characteristics of the small sturdy hill cattle, and can distinguish admixture with the larger, more lightly built plains animals. As in the past what were accepted as hill bulls were purchased at rates varying according to their body weights there was every inducement for contractors to bring unsuitable animals. Again, difficulty was experienced in obtaining supplies to keep pace with the rate of consumption. It was to the advantage of contractors to bring animals from the outlying districts of Almora and Garhwal during seasons of the year when despatch along the difficult hill roads was
6 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, relatively easy and mortality en route from lack of grazing was small. Hence, the out-kraals became congested with cattle at these seasons and there was among them subsequently considerable mortality due, frequent- ly, to foot-and-mouth disease, inanition, and a peculiar form of weakness without definite lesions probably comparable to the fatal condition, the socalled Bergkrankheit, commonly observed among cattle taken up for grazing into the higher regions of the Swiss Alps.. (The altitude of Muktesar is 7,500 feet above sea level.) Owing, therefore, to the pressing necessity of obtaining the best available animals for virus production and for the large scale investigations upon the etiology and immunity of rinderpest and for effecting all possible economies, arrangements were made to effect contracts with suitable individuals for the supply to Muktesar of hill bulls, to be paid for at graded rates according to conformation to type, age, and condition, as judged by the Veterinary Officer, and to be delivered in batches at stated intervals during the year to meet the current needs of the laboratory. A scale of prices was drawn during the 1923-24 season, and the arrangements proved to be mutually most satisfactory to the laboratory and the contractors. After the year's experience, the grading and scales of payment were somewhat modified for the 1924-25 season. The apparently greater consumption in bulls is due chiefly to the purchase of smaller animals as desired. Efforts to dispose of hill bulls discontinued from use by sale to culti- vators proved almost wholly ineffectual, as they were too small for their use, and hence such animals were utilized in the course of researches into other important diseases. During both seasons the buffaloes utilized at Izatnagar were purchased by the staff in local markets and fairs, as this procedure was found to be more economical than purchase from contractors. The mortality among the buffaloes during the process of serum making there was relatively small, 35.88 per cent during the winter season 1922-23, and 21.93 per cent during the season 1923-24. The discontinued buffaloes were for the most part disposed of by sale, but some were returned to Muktesar for further use. As will be indicated later in this report, the expenditure upon cattle during the two years under review has been fully justified. In past years considerable anxiety had been felt by officers in charge of this laboratory on account of the outcry among certain sections of the community against the destruction of cattle at the institution. It was indeed appre- ciated that the procedure of hyper-immunization carried out in the pro- duction of an anti-rinderpest serum offended the cherished beliefs of the Hindu population, and that even the contention that the serum obtained saved the lives of large numbers of cattle in India did not alto- gether furnish them with the conviction necessary to allay their fears. Hence, having in mind that the full understanding and sympathy of the community must be enlisted if progress was to be made in controlling one of the greatest limiting factors in its welfare, the diseases of its live-
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 7 stock, intensive efforts were made to exploit means of obtaining the most invaluable serum without destruction of cattle. Researches in this direc- tion have now culminated with the discovery of the desired means, so that henceforward we are able to declare that in the manufacture of serum against rinderpest at Muktesar no cattle need be destroyed. Forest supplies. During the year 1922-23, 25,378 maunds of fuel wood, 1,532 maunds of charcoal, 4,100 maunds of green grass, 15,697 maunds of green oak leaves (for fodder) and 2,334 maunds of hay were obtained from the Muktesar Reserved Forest. During the year 1923-24, 30,837½ maunds of fuel wood, 2,066 maunds of charcoal, 5,190½ maunds of green grass, 6,626 maunds of oak leaves, and 2,637½ maunds of hay were obtained. The operations in the Reserved Forests were undertaken according to the prescribed working plan drawn up by the Indian Forest Service with success. Much difficulty had been experienced in the past in regard to obtaining adequate supplies of fuel on account of the unre- liability of contractors, but in 1923 a local contractor, Lala Joga Sah, agreed to try his best to supply the laboratory needs without written contract, and hitherto has been very successful. There were no incen- diaries in the forest area. Reafforestation of treeless gaps in the inner laboratory area by planting seeds of pine, laburnum, and Caprissus sempervivens was attempted, and steps taken to prevent the denuding of this area. Arrangements were made for the purchase from contractors of the fuel supplies of the Izatnagar laboratory, amounting to 950 maunds of fuel wood, during the season 1922-23, and 1,750 maunds of fuel wood during the season 1923-24. (d) Labour. During the year 1922-23, the average daily number of coolies employed, in general farm duties comprising out-kraal attendance, cultivation, and maintenance of estate, was 386 ; 504 men were recruited and 520 absconded or were discharged. In addition, an average daily strength of 254.8 gwallas (cattle attendants) was employed in the inner sheds in connection with serum-making and experimental work. During the year 1923-24, the average daily strength of coolies was 265 (248 recruited and 380 discharged or absconded), and of gwallas 253 (108 recruited and 71 discharged or absconded). The same arrangements as existed in previous years were made in regard to the recruitment and employment of the labourers, mostly Dotiyals ; there were no outbreaks of contagious disease among them and no labour troubles ; they seemed throughout to be very contented with their lot and performed their work admirably. (e) Transport. The difficulties experienced in preceding years in regard to transport of laboratory products and supplies to and from our railhead, Kathgodam, persisted during the year 1922-23, but in view of the general falling in the costs of labour and foodstuffs the question of price rates was carefully re-examined before the commencement of the year 1923-24. Acting upon the advice kindly tendered by the Deputy Commissioner, Naini Tal District (Mr. Edye, I.C.S.), the advertised
8 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, contract was given to our former contractor at a decreased rate of 25 per cent. In spite of the contractor's apprehensions, the necessary transport arrangements, which comprised in addition to that of previous years those of a large quantity of serum returned from Izatnagar, were executed with greater despatch and facility than in any preceding year. The decreased transport rates also affected advantageously the prices tendered for the grain supplies delivered to the laboratory from Haldwani. (f) Laboratory appliances and technical equipment. During both years under report the budget grant of laboratory for " Purchase of Chemicals and Apparatus " was heavily overspent, and payments were effected by reappropriation from savings under other budget heads, notably " Feed and Keep of Animals." The annual budget allotment for this purpose, Rs. 30,000, had remained stationary from preceding years, when the work undertaken at the laboratory consisted almost wholly of routine serum and vaccine production. With the great increase in the research activities of the laboratory and the advent of a number of officers who were directed to devote almost their entire energies towards research into animal disease, the consumption of glassware and other laboratory apparatus and appliances increased tremendously, and if it had not been possible to " carry " these officers upon savings effected by scrupulous attention to economy elsewhere, much valuable informa- tion now available regarding the diseases of live-stock in India would not have been available. The most rigid scrutiny was also exercised over " Store " issues, and thanks to the foresight of Mr. G. P. Goffi, purchases of all stores consumed in considerable quantities were effected after receiving quotations for the annual requirements from a number of firms, and, finally, steps were taken to secure advantages by purchases through the India Stores Department. Glassware for the despatch of serum to the field took the same form as in the immediately preceding years, but endeavours were made to procure supplies of more uniform and presentable receptacles. Every effort was made to obtain our require- ments from manufacturers in India, and in the case of small bottles and ampoules we were well satisfied, but there is still great difficulty in obtain- ing large supplies of test tubes and other wares which have to withstand heat sterilization from glass manufacturers in this country. Expendi- ture was also incurred in the purchase of material for the various classes of officers admitted to the laboratory for systematic training, and, further, certain pieces of larger apparatus, such as an experimental serum-drying plant, were purchased to experiment on means for exploiting the resources of the institution. (g) Farm Cultivation and Dairy. The Muktesar station was visited on 24th, April 1922, by the Imperial Agriculturist, Mr. G. S. Henderson, and following upon a careful inspection of the resources of the laboratory area a report was drawn up by him indicating the most profitable lines upon which to develop the cultivable land and dairy for the benefit of the station. Steps were subsequently taken to give full effect to his recommendations. The most promising area for the commencement
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31 ST MARCH, 1924 9 of an extension of cultivation operations, namely at Latoli village, which had been allowed to run derelict and become covered with jungle for a number of years, was added to the dairy for concurrent development,. 14 acres were cleared during the year 1.922-23 and 84 acres during 1923-24. Excellent crops of fodder have been grown upon the cleared area, pri- marily for the provision of green food and silage for the dairy herd, including the experimental dairy herd, now maintained at the laboratory. The amount of fodder grown on the area of 2½ acres which were under cultivation in 1922-23 was 92 maunds, and during 1923-24, 2,858 maunds were obtained from the rabi crop. The acreage of land under cultivation elsewhere in the station was 42½ in 1922-23, and 53¾ in 1923-24, providing 1,838 maunds fodder in 1922-23, and 10,067 maunds fodder in 1923-24. The extension of cultivation elsewhere is being kept in abeyance until information is forthcoming concerning the success of the Latoli experi- ment. The demands for green fodder from the station gardens for the feeding of small animals considerably increased during the years under report. Acting likewise upon the advice of the Imperial Agriculturist, steps were taken to improve the milk producing capacities of the cattle main- tained at the Dairy, by the purchase through the Imperial Dairy Expert, of good class Karachi and Thar-Parker cows for crossing with the high class Holstein bull kindly lent by the Imperial Agriculturist to the Dairy. In order to investigate the very important problem of the immunity of calves towards rinderpest and also to ascertain the susceptibility of various breeds and cross-breeds to contagious bovine abortion it was decided in 1922 to maintain a number of cattle at the Dairy as an Experi- mental herd, the accounts of which are kept separate from those of the Dairy herd maintained for the purpose of supplying the needs in milk of the inhabitants of the station and which is run on a self-supporting basis. The quantity of milk sold to the station inhabitants during 1922-23 was 16,416 seers at a price of 3 annas per seer and 2,962½ seers at 4 annas per seer, and during 1923-24 14,238 seers, at a price of 4 annas per seer. It is anticipated that in a few years, when results have accrued from the scheme now in operation for the improvement of the Dairy and cows of small profit have been eliminated, ample supplies of milk will be placed at the disposal of the inhabitants at a low rate, a consideration which, together with the provision of ample cheap supplies of vegetables, makes much for their contentment in this isolated station. In March, 1923, the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India (Mr. S. Milligan) inspected the resources of the Izatnagar estate, where about 800 acres of land, the greater part of which is of fair quality for cultivation, are available. It was decided to lease out the land for the first few years during which serum production is carried out on the estate to a contractor, in return for a certain proportionate yield of the grain produced on the land, but that as soon as sufficient experience has been obtained concerning our needs for the animals maintained during the serum season at Izatnagar steps should be taken to exploit the
10 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, agricultural resources of the estate for our direct advantage. Much cre- dit is due to Mr. G. P. Goffi for the enthusiasm with which he has sup- ervised the execution of operations for the extension of cultivation and the development of the Dairy. (h) Laboratory Engineering Department. During the years under report, the department in charge of the laboratory Engineer, Mr. W. Pryde Watson, was worked under greater pressure than at any time since the opening of the laboratory. The cause of the excess of work was the increased demands in electricity and gas, mainly due to the development of the research activities of the laboratory, and the large amount of mechanical engineering work which was undertaken by the Engineer to supply the needs of the technical staff of the laboratory. In 1922-23, 19,753 units of electricity were produced, an increase of 36.8 per cent over that of the previous year. In 1923-24, there was a slight decrease (199 units) due to the research officers being away on tour during the winter months. No breakdowns occurred in the oil engine, dynamo, or storage battery ; the spare oil engine parts ordered through the Public Works Department arrived early in 1923, but the condition of some of the parts was very unsatisfactory. During the winter 1923-24, when there was a lull in the work, opportunity was taken for a thorough overhaul of the engine. The storage battery has now reached the limit of its efficient life (8½ years), according to the instruc- tions laid down by the Electrical Inspector to the United Provinces Government. There was a much enhanced demand for power from the battery, amounting to 10,410 units in 1922-23, an increase of 90.83 per cent over the previous year; the output decreased in 1923-24 to 8,516 units. The total quantity of water pumped from the spring and collecting dams at Muktesar for distribution to the station amounted to 2,186,796 gallons in 1922-23 (an increase of 3.8 per cent. on previous year), and 2,452,100 gallons in 1923-24 (increase of 11 per cent). The amount of electricity consumed in pumping water in 1923-24, however, was increased by 18.75 per cent., as all extra water had to be pumped from No. 3 dam, the water at No. 2 dam having been found unfit for consumption. In 1923, the scheme for an extension in the water supply system of the station, originally drafted by the Engineer in 1919, was carefully examined and elaborated on the spot by Major Rhodes, Executive Engineer, 3rd Division, Public Health Department, United Provinces, and subsequently bacteriological tests and chemical analyses were made of the likely sources of potable water. A comprehensive scheme was thus drafted sufficient to supply the needs of all the station with an adequate, safe, and conve- nient supply of water, and this scheme also included the installation of a filtration plant, for bacteriological tests showed that the water supplies represented a source of grave potential danger to the inhabitants at certain seasons of the year. It is unfortunate that lack of funds have prevented the speedy execution of the scheme. Much apprehension is felt with regard to the possibility of a break- down in the single oil engine which is at present the only source of power
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 11 for pumping the water supplies of the station. In previous reports it has been stated that projects have been taken up for the extension of the present source of power, either by the installation of extra oil engines or by the development of a hydro-electric scheme . Financial considera- tions have precluded the materialization of these projects, but having regard to the utter dependence of the station as it has now grown upon a continuous power supply, for pumping of water, lighting, and running of technical machinery, serious disaster may result if a standby set is not available for the development of essential power when there is a breakdown of the existing set. Centrifugation was undertaken of 18,504 litres of blood in 1922-23 (an increase of 80 per cent. over the figures of the preceding year) and of 11,878 litres in 1923-24 (a decrease of 30.4 per cent.). The decrease in the latter year was due to relegation of a very large proportion of the routine work to the Bareilly branch laboratory during the cold weather of the year. It is hoped that the figures of 1922-23 will not be reached in future years, unless there are some unexpected technical developments in connection with the routine products prepared for issue from the laboratory. In past years, Directors of this laboratory have had much ground for fear from a breakdown in the centrifuge plant of the labora- tory, upon which the separation of a profitable yield of serum depended. A very expensive and efficient system of centrifuges was installed in 1920 and has worked well since, but owing to the increasing demands that have been made upon it in succeeding years some anxiety has been felt that it would not last long with the strain that has been placed upon it, both from the demands of routine serum production and experimenta- tion. In 1923-24, the system was relieved considerably by the trans- ference of a very large portion of the anti-rinderpest manufacture to Bareilly, during the colder months, where buffaloes are employed entirely as serum producers; the spontaneous sinking of the solid elements in the oxalated blood of the buffalo renders available a sufficient yield of plasma at once, and it has been computed that the extra amount obtain- able after centrifugation would not be commensurate with the cost of centrifugation at that station. Further, as the outcome of the researches carried out at the laboratory during the last three years the processes of manufacturing the two chief products prepared for issue, namely, anti rinderpest serum and anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum, have been perfected and simplified to such an extent that both can be undertaken relatively much more cheaply at the plains sub-station during the colder months, and the expensive centrifuge plant at Muktesar need hardly be called upon except for carrying out experimental tests. The gas production, for heating purposes, at the laboratory showed a marked increase in both years. In 1922-23 it reached 453,600 cubic feet, an increase of 56 per cent. over the preceding year, and in 1923-24, it was 578,800 cubic feet (an increase of 28 per cent.). The installation of the new steam sterilizing plant, which is now in full working order, will relieve the gas production plant, however, very considerably, and
12 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, it is not anticipated that the very excessive demands on this plant and the personnel employed, necessitated by the development of research, will occur again. Great difficulty had been experienced during the winter months in obtaining the proper heat in the retorts for gas manufacture, owing to the effect of frequent snowfalls upon the exposed wood fuel, but it is hoped that this drawback will be remedied when a protection shed has eventually been constructed. During the years under review, an experimental serum drying plant, for the desiccation of serum at a low temperature in vacuo, was purchased from Germany (Herr. Emil. Passburg-Berlin) and installed, with a view to extending the application of the process to the entire serum output of the laboratory if the trials should prove successful. A few preliminary tests have indicated that the form of apparatus employed is not wholly successful for serum. The new sterilizing house was brought to near completion during the period under review; two 10 n. h. p. steam boilers were installed in a boiler house erected on the site of the old saw mill, and one 8 ft. x4 ft. horizontal autoclave, two 4 ft. × 3 ft. horizontal autoclaves, four instan- taneous hot water heaters, one large steam heated radiator, one steam heated calorifier, with pipes and fittings, were also received from England, and the whole sterilizing plant installed in working order. The boilers were surveyed by the Boiler Inspector to United Provinces Government and were passed for 100 lb. per sq. inch working pressure. The pressure demanded for laboratory needs is 60 lb. as a maximum, and so there is an ample margin of safety. The out-laboratory, formerly known as the Charbon Laboratory, was refitted to suit the needs of Dr. Soparkar, who had been deputed to the laboratory to execute the experiments outlined in connection with the projected tuberculosis enquiry. Steps were also taken to have the out laboratory known as the Mallein Laboratory completely fitted for the execution of exceptionally risky routine bacteriological work, and a new electrically heated incubator room was installed in it. In the laboratory working rooms the 18 incubators and two incubator rooms, heated by oil, gas, or electricity were under the charge of the Engineer, and some difficulty was experienced owing to mishaps in tem- perature regulation when the incubators contained important cultures; perhaps, with increasing experience, he may be able to avert these dis- concerting accidents. A number of arc lamps were installed for micro- photography, episcope, and dark ground illumination work. The new apparatus, purchased by Mr. Sheather, for microphotography was pro- perly erected in a special room. Numerous fittings and repairs were carried out by the Engineer in the laboratories. The work of laying down the new kerosene oil storage tanks was nearly completed.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 13 The godowns on the road to our railhead, at Kathgodam, Champi, and Padambori were re-roofed and altered, departmentally under the supervision of the Engineer. Other duties included charge of the saw mill, farm machinery (a grain crusher, formerly used in the preparation of atta in the Government shop, was purchased, and is likely to crush enough grain for the needs of animals for many years; a new oil-cake crusher was erected), and dairy machinery (electric light was installed in the Dairy area and implements motor driven). The heavy falls of snow during the winter 1922-23 caused much damage to the overhead transmission lines. Temporary arrangements in connection with sterilizers, incubators, and water supply were carried out by the Engineer at the Izatnagar branch laboratory. (i) Building construction. As in previous years, since the inception of the laboratory, the construction of buildings and the maintenance and repairs of roads and buildings within the laboratory estate was a charge of the Public Works Department, United Provinces, and great credit is due to this department for the substantial construction of work buildings and residences. There has been allotted to the laboratory during recent years a sum of Rs. 50,000 which is placed as a lump sum annually at the disposal of Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India for the con- struction of what are known as " Minor Works," and a further sum of about Rs. 30,000 is expended on maintenance and repair items. Owing to the prevailing financial stringency the allotment of funds for the construction of " Major Works " was greatly curtailed during the years under report, and the only items executed under this heading were quarters for two Veterinary Inspectors and the completion of quarters for a second Veterinary Deputy Superintendent and four Dressers. The reason why a paragraph is inserted concerning this subject in this Report is because since September 1922 Government of the United Provinces, Public Works Department, Buildings and Roads Branch, has enquired as to whether the supervision of this work could not be undertaken departmentally and not indirectly, through the Local Government. Replies were sent to effect that the staff of the laboratory was not in a position to take up civil construction work in this peculiar locality in the present state of its experience. However, in the winter of 1923-24, intimation was received from the Government of India that the supervi- sion of the laboratory work would be taken out of the hands of the Local Government, and must be carried out departmentally and technical guidance would be received through the Chief Engineer, Delhi. Much anxiety was felt lest the responsibility for carrying out this technical work and the proper spending of moneys should prove too onerous and Government was approached again with a view to letting the matter remain in the hands of the local authorities. Much delay was caused in correspondence, and arrangements were made provisionally for the
14 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, execution of the work departmentally during the following year, 1924- 25. Fortunately, the arrangements proved ultimately unnecessary, and matters were allowed to remain as they were before. The laboratory is much indebted to Mr. R. Gadsby, Executive Engineer, Naini Tal Pro- vincial Division, for the interest he has taken during the last three years in its welfare. (j) Medical and Sanitary arrangements. During the years under report the medical officers of the station were (1) Mr. Har Govind Dayal Mathur from 21st May, 1922, to 9th November, 1922 (this officer left to hold a Rockefeller Foundation Scholarship, tenable in the United States of America), and (2) Mr. Chatrapuri Goswami from 15th Novem- ber, 1922, to 13th March, 1924. On 24th March, 1924, an officer of the Indian Medical Department was appointed to the charge of the dispensary, Dr. O. H. Gade, late Assistant Superintendent, King George's Hospital, Lucknow. The sanction of the Government of India for the appoint- ment of a Sanitary Inspector on a rate of salary of Rs. 50-2½-75 was received on 26th February, 1923, but hitherto our efforts to attract a suitable man on this scale of pay have been unsuccessful. The period was remarkably free from serious disease ; one case of small pox was im- ported into the station on 27th February, 1923, but no spread of the disease occurred. There is room for much improvement in the arrange- ments for the disposal of refuse in the station, which presents consider- able difficulties in this area. (k) Library. Steps were taken to complete all sets of volumes of current literature, and owing to generally increased prices of all literature the budget allotment for the library has now increased to Rs. 4,000 from Rs. 2,500 in the last pre-war year 1913-14, for subscriptions to nearly the same periodicals and the purchase of necessary books. An endeavour was made to record all relevant technical articles systematically on a card-index system. Having regard to the large expansion in the research activities of the laboratory and the steps that have now been taken for the advanced training of veterinary officials visiting the laboratory from all over India, there has arisen an urgent need for a trained librarian to supervise this essential part of the institution. The policy of placing the library in the charge of a low paid clerk, of exceptionally low ability, has led to inconvenience and losses far out of proportion to the enhanced remuneration that would have to be paid to an educated, specially trained individual, and it is hoped that Government will accord sanction soon to a proposal to place the library in the charge of a qualified man. (l) Branch laboratory. The function of the plains sub-station are commented upon elsewhere in this report. Briefly, it is to relieve the parent laboratory at Muktesar of as large a portion as possible of the routine work of serum manufacture, for on account of the relatively much greater cost of production, at Muktesar, situated as it is 27 miles from its railhead on the plains, due to expense incurred in the transport of the necessary foodstuffs for animals and men from the " plains" and the
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 15 higher rates paid for labour, it is a sound policy to unload the maximum amount of work involving upkeep of large animals on to the plains sta- tion. In 1902, a small station was opened at Kurgaina near Bareilly, for experimental research entirely in the first place, but the economic possibilities of serum manufacture there were seen in the year 1912-13. However, the Kurgaina site was too restricted for the work and in dangerous proximity to the main thoroughfare. Hence in 1912 the late Col. Holmes, when he was Director of this laboratory, moved Govern- ment to purchase an extensive plot of land, extending to 700 acres, situated at Izatnagar near the headquarters of the R. & K. Railway. Sanction was obtained in 1913 and the erection of buildings commenced. Owing to Col. Holmes death on 28th February 1915 and the outbreak of the war the scheme subsequently suffered many vicissitudes, and on the 4th December, 1919, a meeting comprising the Hon'ble Sir Claude Hill, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.S., the Hon'ble Mr. R. A.Mant,C.S.I., I.C.S., Mr. J. Mackenna, C.I.E., I.C.S., Mr. A.L. Sheather, B.Sc., Col. G.K. Walker, C.I.E., Col. W. F. Harvey, I.M.S., and Dr. E. J. Butler, M.B., F.L.S. was called at Pusa at the instigation of the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India to enquire as to the desirability of retaining the site. The final conclusions arrived at by the committee on the data supplied by Mr. Sheather, the then Director of the laboratory, were that " Bareilly is not suitable either for a manufacturing centre or for a research institute and that the idea of utilizing the buildings there for the purpose of extending Muktesar operations had better be abondoned at once." In 1920, Mr. Pool, the officiating Director of this laboratory, with much foresight as to the potentialities of a tributary " plains " station, reopened the project and strongly advised the retention and development of the Izatnagar site. In this matter he was strongly and shrewdly supported by Mr. Milligan, the Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India. The sanction of Government was therefore obtained for the commencement of operations at Izatnagar in 1922, and the Kurgaina site was sold by auction through the district authorities. 814,372 doses of anti-rinderpest serum were made there during the cold weather 1922-23, and 2,487,310 doses during the cold season 1923-24. The relief was so considerable as the result of the operations of the latter season that sufficient stocks of anti-rinderpest serum were on hand to meet the anti- cipated demands for the whole of the hot weather season 1924, without calling upon Muktesar to make any of this serum specially, although small quantities would be forthcoming from certain large-scale experi- ments. An attempt was also made to manufacture anti-hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum there during the 1923-24 season, but the results were not successful owing to lack of sufficient knowledge in the necessary special technique at the time. The research work which has been done since at Muktesar, however, justifies the hope that the greater part of our needs in this serum can readily be met also during the cold weather season on the " plains," so that the Muktesar laboratory can be reserved very largely for the work for which it is admirably suited, the B
16 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, investigation of epizootic disease and delicate bacteriological and other work necessitating attention throughout all seasons of the year. The only permanent buildings now erected on the Izatnagar site are certain residential quarters, and the housing of animals is effected by the erection at the commencement of each season of temporary straw chuppers. On 15th March, 1923, Mr. Milligan, Agricultural Adviser to the Govern- ment of India, carefully examined the site with me, and a scheme for the economic development of the laboratory involving a capital outlay on buildings, spread over a number of years, was drawn up for submission to Government. Later, the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Education, Health and Lands, Mr. M. S. D. (now Sir Montagu) Butler visited the site with me, and after consideration it was decided to postpone questions of permanent development pending the acquisition of further anticipated technical knowledge concerning the processes of anti-rinderpest serum manufacture. This decision soon proved to be a wise one. (m) Finances, (i) Income. During the year 1922-23, the income de- rived from the sale of laboratory products amounted to Rs. 5,02,396-14, as against Rs. 4,39,459-13-9 in the preceding year. The sum included Rs. 3,812-15 realized on outstanding bills of the previous years. Bills amounting to Rs. 35,762-3 were still due at the close of the year. The amount also included the sum of Rs. 11,063-7 realized from the sale of products to the Military Department. During the year 1923-24, the income of the laboratory amounted to Rs. 4,90,721-7-10, inclusive of the sum of Rs. 35,762-3 realized upon the outstanding bills of the previous year. Bills amounting to Rs. 44,294-4 were still due at the close of the year. (ii) The budget expenditure of the laboratory for the year 1922-23 was Rs. 7,55,815-6-8, distributed under the various heads indicated in Appendix V-A. The expenditure in 1923-24 was Rs. 6,96,322-2-1 (see Appendix V-B.); a decrease in the budget grant of Rs. 30,000 was made under the head " Feed and Keep of Animals " owing to the anti- cipated falling in prices of labour, foodstuffs, and animals. For reasons stated elsewhere in this report the reduction in prices did not mate- rialize, as concerned Muktesar. During the year 1922-23. there was therefore a deficit of Rs. 2,46,439-4-11 in income as compared with expenditure, and in 1923-24, Rs. 2,05,600-10-3. These results were frankly disappointing. With effect from 1st April, 1922, Government had sanctioned a fifty per cent. increase in the prices of laboratory products with a view to equalizing the expendi- ture and income of the laboratory. This hope would have been realized if the conditions prevailing in regard to the issue of sera that had existed in previous years had continued. However, with the increase in prices there came a marked decrease in the demand for serum, notably anti- rinderpest serum. It is worthy of interest therefore to compare the income and expenditure figures of previous years with the issues of anti-
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 17 rinderpest serum in order to see the reasons why it was hoped that the suggested rise in the prices of products would place the laboratory almost on a self-supporting basis:18 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, Madras Presidency in 1922 of a small charge, amounting to eight annas for each head of cattle, upon animal owners for all cattle protected with serum in the scene of an outbreak of rinderpest. It was undoubtedly believed that this policy would recoup the cost of the serum purchased by the Local Government. The effect, however, was to cause such a diminution in the application of the system of protection that the demand for serum became almost negligible. Retrenchment in expenditure. A lengthy memorandum was drawn up at the request of Government for presentation to the Indian Retrench- ment Committee that sat at Delhi during the winter season of 1922-23. Great pains were taken to explain the functions of the laboratory, as a premier institution for investigating methods of controlling the great contagious diseases of animals in India, the work already accomplished in mitigating the ravages of disease and which could not be represented in direct monetary returns, the position of the laboratory as a centre for advanced training upon animal disease, and the efforts that were being made to make income balance expenditure. The Inchcape Committee in their Report, however, stated: " .............. We are informed by the Revenue and Agriculture Department that Muktesar could be made to fully pay its way and while we recognize the importance of extending the protection against disease which is afforded by the use of vaccines and sera, we do not think there is any justification for selling these products at an un-economic price. We recommend therefore that steps should be taken to place the Institute on a self-supporting basis for 1923-24." As has been stated earlier, the anticipations of the Revenue and Agriculture Department that this institution could be made to pay its way fully would have been completely borne out if there had been an undiminished demand for serum and purchasers had continued to have unlimited means to pay for their needs. Further, it is probable that to the purely commercial mind, with closest interest in the products sold in the open market for profit to the vendor, there ought to be no justification for diminished returns with growing experience in exploita- tion. However, even if this institution is to be regarded merely as a serum manufactory then it is clear to the student of national interests that its function would bear most resemblance to that of an arsenal, to manufacture and retain stocks of defensive material estimated to be capable of warding off the gravest calamity. Hence, in spite of the fact that the demand for serum may fluctuate greatly from year to year, and a great diminution in demand must be regarded as a salutary pheno- menon from the national standpoint, yet the laboratory must always be ready to cope with demands equivalent to the highest known in past experience. During the fortunate years when the country suffers least from disease the laboratory must therefore maintain its equipment ready to meet the maximum demand and retain stocks of perishable material manufactured at considerable cost so as to comply with any likely emer- gencies. Although the most strenuous endeavours will certainly be made to place the institute on a sound financial basis, it is believed necessary to explain its peculiarities as a revenue-producing concern.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31st MARCH, 1924 19 Again, as will be noted later in the sections dealing with research and education, an increase in the activities of the laboratory out of all pro- portion to those which existed in previous years took place during the years under report. These pursuits, of the greatest national importance, were undertaken entirely out of savings in what had previously been almost entirely a budget for the manufacture of saleable products, and heavy expenses, notably under " Purchase of Chemicals and Apparatus were met by reappropriation from other heads. The difference between income and expenditure may therefore be regarded fairly as the cost to the country of maintaining a first class institution for research into the diseases of its animals and for higher veterinary education. In 1923-24, the accounts of the laboratory were officially audited, for the first time since it was opened 29 years ago, by the Auditors of Local Funds Accounts of the United Provinces. Many complexities had crept into the systems of accountancy introduced and developed from time to time during this long period, and it is hoped that much assistance will be derived from the report of trained outside authorities upon the methods in use at the laboratory. III. PREPARATION AND ISSUE OF SERA AND VACCINES. (A summary of the results reported to have been obtained after the use of these products in the field is given in Appendix I-A. and I-B.). (a) Anti-rinderpest serum. During the year 1922-23, 2,000,661 doses (dose=5 c. c.) of this serum were prepared and 1,937,552 issued as against 3,631,940 prepared and 2,930,601 issued in 1921-22. In 1923-24, 3,309,027 doses were prepared and 1,986,399 doses were issued. The reasons why such an apparent excess over anticipated needs was produced during the latter year were, first, because steps were taken for the first time to manufacture as large a quantity as possible at Izatnagar during the cold weather to relieve Muktesar to the utmost during the following year, and secondly, there had accumulated at Muktesar a large stock of serum of not very satisfactory potency and arrangements were laid down for the preparation of an excess of highly potent serum at Izatnagar to be returned to Muktesar and mixed with the stocks there to an extent compatible with the attainment of the guaranteed potency, as indicated by careful tests. There was available at the commencement of the following financial year a stock of 1,922,896 doses of serum fit for issue for preventive purposes, 154,099 doses of specially prepared serum of very high potency for use in the serum simultaneous method of inocula- tion, and 236,802 doses not tested and passed for issue. The condition as regards a reserve of serum to comply with urgent indents was there- fore placed upon a more satisfactory footing than at any time in the past, and provision was made for immediate compliance with all orders. Until the end of the period under report, purchasers were asked to take as much of their anticipated needs in serum as they could direct from Bareilly before the close of the season, so as to relieve the laboratory of the necessity of returning surplus stocks, manufactured there at relatively
20 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, small cost, to Muktesar. In order to assist us in this respect, customers were also asked to store as much as they could in cool storage conditions. Tests upon numerous samples returned from the provinces, because they appeared to fail to give the expected results in the scene of outbreaks, have shown, however, that in the storage conditions not uncommonly adopted in the plains deterioration in potency takes place rather rapidly. The usual method of preserving serum adopted in the past here has been to mix the product with one-half per cent. carbolic acid, but tests have shown that certain, organisms (staphylococci) grow luxuriantly in the mixture, and it is probable that their prolonged action under favourable temperature conditions may bring about the relatively rapid deteriora- tion. It has been found that in the ordinary storage accommodation of Muktesar a good serum remains potent for two years. Tests upon the relative efficacy of other preservatives executed by Mr. Bennett have shown that certain of the cresols, notably 0.35 per cent. orthocresol in an alkaline medium, is a better preservative. The information now available tends to show that the most economical procedure for the laboratory is to manufacture nearly all its annual stocks of serum at Izatnagar, return them to Muktesar for storage (the cost of return amounts to less than two per cent. of the sale price and is cheaper than the main- tenance of a freezing plant at Bareilly), careful tests upon the hill bulls that are available more cheaply locally, and mixing, and then request provinces to indent on Muktesar at any one time for little more than the minimum anticipated requirements to cope with emergencies, so as not to retain excessive stocks on hand that are likely to have suffered much deterioration by the time they are needed. As is stated elsewhere in this report, much progress was accomplished during the period in per- fecting and cheapening the processes of serum manufacture. This aspect will be dealt with in the section dealing with Research, but it may be said here that the progress has consisted in devising means of (i) producing a serum that is very potent and not toxic for use in the serum simultaneous method of immunization, (ii) producing a serum for use in preventive inoculation for a prolonged period from " serum makers " after the simple initial immunization, and discarding the hitherto adopted costly and somewhat revolting method of so-called hyperimmunization, (iii) preparing the annual stocks cheaply at the plains sub-station, stor- age, and careful testing at Muktesar. Research into this subject was stimulated particularly by an unusual number of accidents that occurred among cattle administered large doses of serum during the serum-simul- taneous inoculations at the Military Dairies in the cold weather season 1922-23. The accidents were traced to the issue inadvertently by the staff of a serum that had been tested and found satisfactory for preven- tive purposes, but had been obtained from buffaloes after repeated "hyperimmunization" with hill bull blood, and hence had acquired hæmolytic properties capable of producing severe effects when the serum was injected in large amounts into cattle. Prior to the cold weather season 1923-24, the circular printed instruc- tions for the serum simultaneous method were redrafted, and the efficacy
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 21 of the serum recommended for use tested by officers of the laboratory at a number of the Government Military Dairies. There is no need to burden this report with accounts of the efficacy of the serum in the field. The product is one which has to pass strict tests as to its usefulness in the laboratory before it is issued, and its effects make it, when properly used, one of the surest agents known to prophylaxis. A very good customer for the laboratory supplies now is the Iraq Government, and the accounts of the beneficial effects following upon its use in the monthly reports of Veterinary Officer are most en- couraging. It has been stated in the section dealing with the finances of the laboratory that the chief reason for the difference between income and expenditure was the diminished issue of anti-rinderpest serum, and one of the causes of the diminution was the natural greatly decreased prevalence of rinderpest in India during the years under report. The following extracts from the " Reports on the working of the Civil Veteri- nary Department of the Central Provinces and Berar " are fairly repre- sentative :22 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, of serum and 115,050 doses of vaccine prepared, and 177,418 doses of serum and 115,050 doses of vaccine issued during 1921-22. The figures indicate that there has been a large rather steady demand for the serum and a greatly increased demand for the vaccine. The large issue of vaccine is due to the confidence which the veterinary autho- rities in the Punjab have acquired as the result of field experience in the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks in enzootic areas if it is injected into susceptible cattle before the advent of the season of increased prevalence just before the monsoon. Laboratory experience, so far as it has been pursued hitherto, fully justifies the confidence of field workers, for a slight increase in an animal's defences as indicated by a specific agglutination reaction such as can be induced by the inoculation of a " dead " vaccine increases its powers of resistance to a virulent attack very considerably. In other provinces, such as Bihar and Orissa, great confidence has gained in the efficacy of the anti-serum, and the veterinary authorities there state that serum intervention in the face of an outbreak cuts dead the spread of the disease. When one considers that rinderpest and hæmorr- hagic septicæmia are much the most fatal scourges of cattle in India it is a matter for much satisfaction that the laboratory is in a position to issue products to ward off both these diseases. Until recently, some hesitancy had been felt in making this declaration as far as concerned hæmorrhagic septicæmia serum, for the laboratory tests upon its efficacy had proved rather disappointing when small experimental animals were used for test purposes. However, it was found that when the large, naturally susceptible animalsMUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 23 animal subsequently possesses a solid permanent immunity following upon the symptomless infection set up by the suppressed virus. How- ever, at the present time, we are not in a position to press forward the application of this method in the field. If the information in the reports of the Civil Veterinary Department of the Central Provinces again are to be taken as fairly representative there does not seem to have occurred an abatement in the prevalence of hæmorrhagic septicæmia parallel to that which happened in the case of rinderpest:24 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, immunity. In the light of this important knowledge and also bearing in mind that black-quarter is a widespread serious disease of cattle in India, steps were taken to prepare from strains of organisms obtained in morbid material from various parts of the country the " germ-free " safe product and to press forward its use in the different provinces. At the request of the veterinary authorities in the Bombay Presidency an anti-serum was also prepared against black-quarter (to the extent of 140 litres) for use in cutting short the virulent outbreaks which often occur in the villages in this province. (d) Anthrax serum. As in past years the laboratory limited its efforts to preparing a serum against this disease. In 1922-23, 65,118 doses (15 c. c.) were prepared and 34,496 doses issued, as against 47,206 doses prepared and 32,600 doses issued in the preceding year. In 1923-24 there was sufficient stock available to meet anticipated demands without further preparation and 29,834 doses were issued. There was, therefore, a steady demand for this product, but the magnitude of the demand would lend the impression primâ facie that anthrax is a disease of very minor importance in India, at least in comparison with its known prevalence in countries like the Union of South Africa and Argentina. The reports of the provincial veterinary authorities likewise do not give great pro- minence to the disease, although one notes in the Central Provinces reports, for example, that the recorded mortality for the years 1921-22, 1922-23, and 1923-24 was 2,124, 2,035, and 1,388, respectively. Never- theless, it was agreed unanimously by the Second Meeting of Veterinary Officers in India, at Calcutta, in March 1923, that: " The evidence available shows that anthrax is a serious disease of live-stock in India and is much more prevalent than the official records would indicate." The failure to recognize the importance of the disease would seem to be due to the fact that fatalities occur usually in sporadic form, and pass undetected and the absence of adequate machinery for the notification of animal disease. At the time of the Meeting the disease in India had got to assume an unusual economic significance following upon the threat of an embargo upon the importation of East Indian wool, hair, and hides into manufacturing countries unless steps were taken to eliminate infec- tion, as the result of the action taken by the Special Anthrax Committee of the International Labour Organization of the League of Nations. Action was contemplated in the form of compelling exporting countries to undertake disinfection of wool at the ports of export or to institute a proper sanitary organization for the control of the disease among ani- mals. No action has yet materialized. The conditions that obtain in India would probably present great impediments towards the enforce- ment of sanitary police measures, such as are known to be effective in Western countries. It is probable, however, that vaccination against the disease would have to be adopted in many localities where the disease was prevalent, and the laboratory was prepared to face a demand for products for the inoculations. However, the manufacture of a" spore- vaccine " has not been started hitherto, as there has been no demand for it from field workers.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 25 (e) Mallein. The manufacture of mallein was undertaken to supply the different forms of product required by field workers. In 1922-23, 21,279 doses were prepared and 13,484 issued, inclusive of 390 doses specially prepared for use in the intra-palpebral test for glanders; the remainder was ordinary mallein, for the subcutaneous test, issued in 1 c. c. doses. These figures compared with 47,144 doses of ordinary mallein prepared and issued in the preceding year. In 1923-24,52,812 doses were prepared and 29,162 issued; the issues comprised 15,162 doses of ordinary mallein (at 1 c. c. per dose), 9,000 doses of mallein (diluted 1:4 from con- centrated) for the intra-palpebral (or intra-dermo-palpebral, " I. D. P.") test (at 0.1 c. c. per dose), and 5,000 doses of concentrated (to one-tenth from ordinary) mallein for the ophthalmic test, at 0.25 c. c. per dose. Prior to the period under report the Army Veterinary Services had ob- tained for the conveniently executed intra-palpebral test a French product (Malleine diluée, au ¼) through the Director General, Indian Medical Services. Very careful tests with infected horses were undertaken at Muktesar in the winter of 1922-23 on the efficacy of the product that could be made here as compared with the French product obtainable, with results that showed the local product to be at least as efficacious as the imported product, and that it could be sold to the Army Department at a favourable price. The proposal to supply the product at these rates received the sanction of Government by the middle of April 1923. (f) Tuberculin. In 1922-23, 442 doses of tuberculin were prepared and issued, as compared with 2,054 doses prepared and 2,066 issued during the preceding year. In 1923-24, 14,004 doses were prepared and 2,724 doses issued. The increased manufacture during the latter year was due to the steps that were taken to prepare a stock of a special tuberculin from cultures of tubercle bacilli of the avian type, for the diagnosis of the disease condition in cattle known as Johne's disease. The evidence availa- ble shows that tuberculosis is a rare disease of cattle in India, and may be considered to be absent from the important milch herds of the country, such as are maintained at the Government Military Dairies for the supply of the troops. However, examinations performed in the laboratory during the period under report showed that a serious infectious condi- tion, manifested as a chronic enteritis, and known as Johne's disease, set up by an organism rather similar to the tubercle bacillus in many of its features, was not uncommon in some of the dairies and caused consi- derable loss. Animals infected with this disease do not respond to tuber- culin prepared in the ordinary way for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, from bacilli of the bovine or human types, but they react during the early stage of infection when they are injected with tuberculin made from bacilli of the avian type. In the circular printed instructions issued concerning this disease, attention was called to this mode of diagnosis and the necessary products were prepared for use in carrying it out. Again, on account of the marked diurnal fluctuations that occur in cattle on the plains of India brought in for testing with tuberculin, a method was advocated for lending corroborative evidence to the
26 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, observations made in the course of executing the ordinary, subcuta- neous test, in which the reaction is merely a thermal one. For the subsi- diary method, known as the intracutaneous test, performed by injecting the test material into one of the anal folds and comparing the subse- quent increase in thickness with the thickness of the opposite, control fold, a special " concentrated " tuberculin was manufactured and stocks kept on hand available for issue for compliance with the terms of the directions in the revised circular instructions. (g) Strangles serum and vaccine. The preparation and issue of these products were undertaken systematically upon an experimental basis on a large scale during the period under report, and the significance of the work will be discussed in the section dealing with research. (h) Vaccine against Contagious Bovine Abortion. The issue of this vaccine as a routine product was commenced in accordance with the terms of a printed circular, but for the reasons stated in the section dealing with research its issue was subsequently confined to an experimental application upon one, only, of the most important Government Military Dairies. (i) Autogenous and specially prepared vaccines. 35 series of doses of these products were issued in 1922-23, and 37 in 1923-24. III. INSTRUCTION. During the period under report the resources of the institution were diverted to the advanced training of veterinary officers in India in the following manner:MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 27 animals upon the men of the type that would be considered suitable to absorb the further training. Upon my arrival in India (after relinquish- ing the above-mentioned post at the Royal Veterinary College, London) Government raised the matter again, and after having pointed out the unique facilities afforded at this institution in the form of suitable material and personnel for teaching visiting officers in the aspect of veterinary science in which competence is to be demanded of them as State servants the outlines of a scheme for a course of training here, extending over two years, were drawn up, and, at the request of Government, placed for consideration before the Meeting of Principals of the Indian Veterinary Colleges held at the Bombay Veterinary College on the 8th to 10th February 1922. This meeting reported:28 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, During the interval between the first and second sessions the officers under training visited the Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, for a demonstration tour. After the end of the systematic training at Muktesar for the second session they visited a number of institutions of particular interest to them in the Punjab:MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31 ST MARCH, 1924 29 teaching of individual visitors necessitated the same amount of time as that of larger classes. The following officers received tuition at the institution in this manner:30 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, that the provinces may take full advantage of the facilities thus offered, it is necessary to extend considerably the living accommodation now available for visitors at Muktesar. These courses must be regarded as of a special nature, and they are not intended in any way to compete with the courses of postgraduate instruction now given at some of the veterinary colleges in India. IV. RESEARCH. It is only intended to deal with this subject cursorily in this report, and to limit reference to the main schemes of research. Since my advent to the laboratory the resources of the institution have been organized to the utmost for research, and at the end of the period under report there had accumulated a large volume of records dealing with a consider- able number of projects taken up. It is hoped soon to embody this knowledge in technical publications, but as the investigations have been in the nature of prolonged experimental researches and most of the staff have had to be patiently trained to turn out substantial results there has been hitherto hardly any output of literature, and the policy has been to restrain publication until results worthy of the facilities afforded by the institution have become available. (a) Rinderpest (Etiological researches). Research work on this disease has been undertaken on a very large scale, as its importance in the live- stock economy of India is immeasurable and, also, the advances made in recent years in research upon diseases of similar nature warranted the intensive application of modern methods of research to obtain further light upon the problem. Moreover, the rugged hilly nature of the station makes it admirably suited for experimental research upon the very infectious diseases, and so when work on rinderpest was first taken up seriously, in April, 1922, a series of 65 chuppers were specially construc- in various places, in each of which a susceptible animal could be isolated and observed without risk of accidental infection during the period while it was under test. The factors which made for the survival in virulence of the causal agency of the disease were first investigated. It had been found by Olitsky (1922) that typhus blood, mixed with about an equal volume of diluted horse serum or peptone solution, survived considerably longer when exposed to air than when it was stored " anaerobically " under a seal of liquid paraffin. Experiments with virulent rinderpest blood stored at body temperature, however, showed that the infective agent became inert usually within three days when it was exposed to air, but that it survived very considerably longer, 10 days or more, when it was covered with a seal of liquid paraffin. At first sight, it might be assumed that the rinderpest virus was anaerobic, but tests showed that the survi- val in an atmosphere of hydrogen was no longer than that in atmos- pheric air. The work of Kligler and Robertson (1922) on the gaseous re- quirements of the spirochaete of human relapsing fever seemed then suggestive, for these authors had demonstrated that the utility of
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 31 the paraffin seal on cultures of this organism lay in its power to prevent the escape of carbon dioxide gas from the culture fluid and that oxygen was necessary for the growth of the organism. Samples of rinderpest blood were then suspended at body temperature in atmospheres containing varying proportions of carbon dioxide, and the finding was made that the virus survived as long when the tension of this gas approximated that of the circulating blood as it did under the paraffin seal. The beneficial effects of the gas were manifested throughout a wide range (from 1 to 10 per cent. of CO2 in the tests). Dilution had long been known to render the virus rapidly inert, and in early tests at the laboratory it seemed that diluting the blood with five times its bulk brought about destruction of virulence in about a day at body temperature even under a paraffin seal. It was subse- quently found, however, that the apparent rapid destruction was a manifestation of accelerated action of the originally present destructive agencies in the more highly diluted fluid, and that the most serious destructive agency was an unfavourable hydrogen-ion concentration of the diluting fluid. When the blood was suspended in high dilution in a slightly diluted serum or in peptone solution adjusted to near the hydrogen-ion concentration of the circulating blood the period of survival was relatively long. Again, numerous tests showed that there was no need to invoke the action of a hypothetical lysin to account for the apparent rapid destruction of the virus in blood exposed to air: the factor of greatest importance appeared to be the transformation that took place in the blood owing to the escape of carbon dioxide gas, and destruction of virus was rapid during this transformation. In old stored serum, stabilized to the reaction of the normal blood by addition of acid, the period of survival of the virus in small amounts of added virulent blood was long. In work published by Frosch and Dahmen upon the cultivation of the foot-and-mouth disease virus long after these experiments were undertaken at Muktesar the authors state that the source of difficulty in obtaining primary cultures is the presence of a lysin in the vesicular lymph used as seed material. Some work done by de Blieck and Winkel (1922) indicates also that the chief deterrent action resides in the rapid change to an unfavourable alkaline reaction that takes place in the serous fluid. Likewise, the virus was very sensitive to an unfavourable reaction in the acid direction, such as takes place during the autolysis of animal tissues. The addition of a small fragment of sterile rabbit kidney, for example, to stored virulent blood rapidly rendered it inert. Bacterial contamination usually exer- cised little effect. Differential high-speed centrifugation of hæmolysed virulent blood suspended in bland fluids of various specific gravities, according to the method published by MacCallum and Oppenheimer (1922) for the de- monstration of the particulate nature of the small-pox virus, brought about only with great difficulty any signs of sedimentation or flotation of the virus ; nevertheless, the results were suggestive that the virus was organismal and capable of separation, and not fluid. c
32 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, A further line of research into the etiology of the disease was to endeav- our to view its characteristics from a different angle, as it were, by implanting it upon a different species of host. The rabbit was chosen for this purpose, but no tissue change was seen after massive local infection, except after intra-ocular injection, when a change was seen for some days in the iris somewhat similar to that seen in specific ophthalmia in horses. After massive intravenous inoculation of virulent ox blood a scarcely perceptible rise in the temperature of the rabbit took place on the following days. It was thought, however, possible that the reaction might be capable of intensification; hence, at various days after inoculation, blood was taken from the originally infected rabbit and " passaged " intensively intravenously through a series of rabbits at various intervals. After a few passages, a very pronounced thermal reaction was manifested by the injected rabbits, usually reaching its maximum on the second or third day, and then subsiding rapidly; sometimes a very slight febrile relapse was seen towards the ninth day. Outward, clinical disturbances were not appreciable, and mortality was rare, and no constant macroscopic lesions could be seen post-mortem. In this way, " strains " of rabbit virus were kept up at the laboratory by " passages" at intervals of 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 7 days for 14 months, after which our stocks of rabbits died out on account of a natural outbreak of pasteurellosis among them. During this period the infectivity of each strain of the rabbit virus was tested upon cattle from time to time, and it seemed to remain virulent throughout; the degree of reaction in the cattle varied from types that were almost symptomless or merely febrile in character, and left a powerful immunity, to those which were nearly as severe as the disease set up by the injection of virulent ox blood, but there was no progressive degradation in virulence. The modified virus never became " safe " for the vaccination of cattle by itself, although it was generally much feebler, and had the advantage of being a " pure " virus,MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 33 liver with not quite so much certainty, and the blood probably; the other films were undoubtedly negative (September 1922). A curious discovery of considerable importance was then made. The sensitiveness of the rinderpest virus to varying concentrations of carbolic acid was being tested, and it was found that over one-half per cent. of this substance rendered the virus inert in a day at body tem- perature. It was thought that perhaps the rinderpest organism might; not have been actually destroyed at this concentration, but that it might merely have lost the property of virulence for cattle; dark-ground examination of material showed bodies34 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, In the first experiments the method of attempted cultivation was to sow the candle fluid into serum obtained with the strictest precautions to prevent escape of its carbon dioxide into the air and separated as quickly as possible from the solid blood clot, and then placed under paraffin in sterile bottles. Subinoculations were made from this genera- tion into one or two per cent Bacto-peptone in Fleisch's (1922) modifica- tion of Ringer's solution, with a fragment of fresh sterile potato added to increase the nutritive qualities. The third subculture in a large flask of this medium became restored to rinderpest after passage through the rabbit, but the material had no " vaccinating " effect upon cattle. In 1923, work was carried out again to repeat the above results, but confirmation was not obtainable of the cultural part of the work, and again in 1924, although the candle fluid could be restored to virulent rinderpest by three rabbit passages, it could not be maintained in the rabbits. In 1923, some candle fluid eventually produced a febrile reaction in the rabbits, quite similar to that of rinderpest, but the rabbit blood failed to set up rinderpest in the ox. The difficulty in regard to obtaining a good initial tractability on the part of the virus in this sort of work seems to be very great, but it is known that analogous diffi- culties were encountered with other viruses before all the factors neces- sary for saprophytic growth were understood. In 1923, a strain of the bovine pleuro-pneumonia virus was kindly sent to us by Dr. Heslop of the Melbourne University, and after much difficulty we succeeded in obtaining very good growth, as measured by the production of opale- scene in culture fluid (peptone as prepared by Meyer and Stickel from liver and pigs' stomachs for the growth of Bacillus botulinus, added to one half of its volume of meat extract, prepared by heating at 80°C, with 0.2 per cent. phosphate buffer, passed through bacterial filter ; it is important to use this medium fresh, for it has a tendency to in- crease in alkalinity on storage). However, the growth obtained was found to be quite incapable of causing even a local swelling in injected cattle. The microscopic appearances were identical to those of the rinderpest candle fluid, and as has been inferred recently by Dahmen a large part of the opalescence is due to a protein precipitate and not the virus, for the stainable bodies are relatively few in both cases to the forms seen under dark-ground illumination, and the coarse morphology of which led the early French investigators to call the organism an " as- terococcus." These cursory notes on the work done intensively here during the period under report are written merely to justify the expenditure entailed in prosecuting the studies. Whether any considerable economic benefit will accrue from the investigations is very problematical, for if the pre- liminary indications of the work are substantiated it may transpire that the cultivation of the rinderpest virus, and of the contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia virus, has little more interest than that of the spiro- chaetes of human yaws and syphilis, for with both these organisms we know that no vaccinal effect can be set up by the inoculation of cultures Record must be made of the sterling services rendered by Mr. M. B.
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 35 Menon, and also by Mr. J. D'Costa (in the clinical observations) in prosecuting the execution with me of these researches without any regard to their personal conveniences. The possibilities of the fly transmission of rinderpest were investigated in the warm weather of 1923 by Mr. S. K. Sen, Assistant to the Imperial Entomologist. A commencement was made by the investigation of the possibility of the mosquito transmission, and on analogy with the work performed with yellow fever of man, a large number of experiments were conducted in which Aëdes (Stegomyia) albopicta was tested as a possible transmitter. The results obtained were of a completely nega- tive order, indicating the virus soon became inert in the body of the mosquito. (b) Rinderpest (Immunity researches). The aims of these researches, to produce an anti-serum of the highest possible potency at the most economical rate, have already been mentioned in the section dealing with the routine manufacture of serum for issue. Briefly, the outcome of numerous experiments was information to the effect that the proce- dure of so-called " hyperimmunization " in the production of an anti- rinderpest serum is not analogous to the practice which goes by the same name adopted in the manufacture of anti-sera against the pathogenic bacteria and toxins. Subsequent to the initial treatment of the serum producers, with a minute dose of virulent material and a controlling dose of anti-rinderpest serum, there occurs what appears to be a maxi- mum diffusion of the virus throughout the body, which results in the development of such a state of immunity on the part of the tissues that the injection afterwards of the amounts of virus that are contained in massive quantities of virulent ox blood set up no more than a local dis- turbance, quite incapable of evoking a tissue response sufficient to drive up the anti-body content of the blood serum beyond the maximum titre attained following upon the preliminary intervention. For a certain limited period following upon the rinderpest reaction, the re- peated injection of massive quantities of virulent ox blood undoubtedly has the effect of partially restoring the potency of the blood serum in anti-bodies, but after the expiry of this lapse of time it has no effect. Work pointing in this direction has already been published by the authori- ties working upon the production of a serum against the disease in the Phillipine Islands, but the most remarkable work illustrating an ana- logous sequence of phenomena to those which arise in the course of the development of the immunity of rinderpest is that of Weil and Breinl recently upon the immunity of small laboratory animals (guinea-pigs and rabbits) towards the virus of human typhus. (Zeitschrift für Im- munitätsforschung und experimentelle Therapie. I Teil. Orig. 1923. Vol. 37, pp. 441-552.) It has been established here, in a similar manner, that, following upon the injection of certainly virulent rinderpest material controlled in regard to its capacity for the development of morbid mani- festations to such an extent by the simultaneous inoculation of a large quantity of a potent anti-serum that the infection is rendered " abortive," ''symptomless," or "blocked-out" clinically, there develops a solid
96 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, immunity, and, in the practice of active immunization of cattle against the disease in the field this is the consummation to be desired, for not only are the treated animals in this way placed beyond risk of direct ill- effects from the rinderpest infection but there is also prevented within them, by the inhibition of specific tissue depression, a resuscitation of dormant internal parasites, notably coccidia, which might otherwise set up a fatal complication. On the other hand, in the production of a potent anti-serum, the duration of anti-body " secretion " (if we accept Madsen's conception of the formation of these specific immune subs- tances or properties) appears to be a function of the intensity of the morbid reaction which the animal organism is able to deal with effectively. With the " blocked-out," or nearly " blocked-out" reaction a potent anti-serum is obtained only for about four weeks after the injection of the virus, whereas after a " mild, but decided " reaction (with not more than five per cent. mortality in the serum producing buffaloes) a potent serum is obtained about a week after the commencement of apyrexia and then for a period of eight weeks, and perhaps longer, without further treatment of the animals. Experiments were also undertaken somewhat extensively in order to ascertain whether the injection of the salts of certain metals would have a stimulating effect upon the secretion of anti-bodies, as has been demonstrated recently by Madsen and his colleagues in the production of anti-diphtheria serum from horses at the Serum Institute at Copenhagen. The effects of the injections when undertaken during a limited period following upon the initial infection seem to be encouraging. The Indian plains buffalo was found to be a much better serum producer, in the sense that it would furnish a good serum for a long period, than the local hill bull. Following upon the accidents that occurred in the Government Mili- tary Dairies during the cold weather season 1922-23 in the active immu- nization of the cattle there against rinderpest, a number of observations relevant to the subject were made at the laboratory and the fatalities were traceable mainly to the injection of a toxic serum. The serum was one which had been prepared from buffaloes by repeated " hyperimmuni- zation " with hill bull blood, and hence it had developed haemolytic properties for ox blood. In the small doses required for preventive inoculation the toxic action was without appreciable serious effect, as had been proved by the tests carried out on it prior to issue at the laboratory, but when inoculated in the large quantities required for active immu- nization, notably of cattle with an admixture of European blood, the toxicity of the serum became a factor of serious importance. In the early stages of the laboratory investigations upon the cheap production of a good anti-rinderpest serum many lengthy tests were made upon the relative efficacy of " hyperimmunization " by various routesMUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 37 to be superior in that the production of unsightly local abscesses, which also had for their effect a depressing action on the potency of the serum, was avoided. However, tests on a large scale during the Bareilly season of 1922-23, when one-half of the buffaloes were treated by the sub- cutaneous method and the other half by the intra-peritoneal failed to show a marked advantage in the latter method over the former. The serum was of about the same potency with both methods, but the (cit- rated) blood injected intra-peritoneally tended to form extensive fibrin- ous clots which entangled the bowel and became infected notably with corynebacteria. Hence, the mortality rate by the method was rather unfavourable. The knowledge now available, however, has indicated that steps should be taken to abandon completely the process of so-called hyper- immunization for the production of an anti-rinderpest serum. A plenti- ful supply can be obtained, from suitable serum-producers, of good potency for a sufficiently long period of time after " setting " the initial rinderpest reaction to the desired degree of intensity, and for econo- mical, utilitarian, and humane reasons the adoption of a routine pro- cedure based upon these principles seems justified. Economic considerations and the phenomenon that susceptibility to mortal attack from accidental Piroplasma bigeminum infection is increased with advancing age, suggested extensive tests upon the pos- sibility of applying effectively the method of active immunization against rinderpest upon very young calves. The results of work hither- to conducted indicates that the procedure is a sound one. Directions for the active immunization of cattle against rinderpest had implied that in "plains " conditions the process could only be applied successfully during the cooler months of the year. In order to ascertain whether there was any real ground for this restriction, a brew of potent anti-serum (B 31) was tested upon hill bulls systematically several times throughout the two years' period simultaneously at Muktesar and Bareilly.. the dates of testing being chosen so as to gain knowledge upon the limiting influences in a "tropical" or " sub-tropical "and a temperate climate. Contrary to what had been assumed, the serum manifested much the same protective action throughout at both stations, and indeed at one of the later simultaneous tests conducted during the hottest time of the year, the potency appeared to be higher at Bareilly than at Mukte- sar ; this paradoxical observation is readily explained in the light of the investigations of recent workers upon climate in relation to the health of human beings, wherefrom it would appear that the basal metabolism of inmates of confined dwellings in temperate countries may be much lower than that of residents in the tropics, and it is therefore pertinent here to remark that the animals under test at Muktesar were housed in substantially-built, closed, stone sheds designed to protect against the adverse effects of cold weather, whereas the Bareilly animals received shelter only in lightly-built, temporary, straw chuppers, within which
38 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, the " aerial envelope or cushion " tending to develop around the animals was susceptible to rapid displacement. It has been stated in the section dealing with the routine manufacture of anti-rinderpest serum that an experimental plant had been obtained for the tests upon the desiccation of serum in vacuo at low temperatures. The results have not been very encouraging on account of the fact that in this type of plant the serum had to be placed in pans, in which ex- cessive frothing took place and ultimate drying was very difficult. Per- haps, tests in which the principle of spraying the liquid on to a revolv- ing drum is adopted may be more successful. Mr. J. Da Costa was responsible mainly for the execution of the ex- perimental tests on the immunity of rinderpest. (c) Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia. Researches upon this disease were directed with the object of ascertaining more information upon the pro- perties of the virus and evolving better methods of securing products for combating the disease. In the past, considerable difficulty had been experienced in arriving at an estimate with regard to the efficacy of the products used for this purpose. The value of the anti-serum can now be very accurately determined by using the natural hosts for test purposes (hill-bulls discontinued from rinderpest have been used). It would appear certain that in the dosage recommended by the laboratory for use in the field the serum is capable of warding off a virulent fatal in- fection, for administered in substantial amount experimentally it obli- terates the effects of a dose of culture virus, obtained after exaltation by passage through the natural host, that would certainly kill a " con- trol " animal. Having, therefore, established a method for testing the potency of an anti-serum steps were taken to develop optimum means of serum production. The serum produced after intravenous hyperim- munization with culture was of almost the same value as that produced after repeated subcutaneous injection, but whereas the former method tended to produce considerable mortality after the development of arthritis, the latter method tended to cause excessive local disturbances at the seat of injection. In earlier work, growth obtained on solid media seemed to be best and most economical for injection, but sub- sequently it would seem that for routine purposes a liquid medium made on the principle of Martin's broth was preferable for routine cultivation (" peptone " obtained by auto-digestion of pigs' stomachs and liver according to the method of Meyer and Stickel, buffered with phosphate, added to muscle or heart extract, heated 80°C, passed through bacterial filter for sterilisation). " Slow " methods of preparing serum producers, by repeated inoculation with " dead " culture, and then with gradually increasing doses of culture of low virulence proved very disappointing when carried out at Izatnagar during the cold season 1923-24, for the mortality during the various stages was excessive. Curiously, a serum of high potency could be obtained after immunization of the buffalo serum producers with cultures of greatly degraded virulence. Mortality
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 39 occurred, however, when the animals were submitted to massive in- jections with very virulent material. The indications at the close of the period under report were that the most economical procedure would be to submit the animals initially to simultaneous inoculation with a large dose of good protective serum and a suitably, relatively large quantity of highly virulent antigen. In the course of experiments upon the rate of development of agglu- tinating powers by the serum of infected animals, it was found that the serum of many " normal" buffaloes possessed an unexpectedly high agglutinating titre, and that the apparent " natural" immunity of the species ran parallel to the degree in which this property was demonstra- ble in the blood serum. Experiments in connection with the effects of " passage " upon the virus were in active progress at the end of the period under report. Pas- sage of a virus which had become very greatly degraded in its pathogenic properties by prolonged cultivation in artificial media, (a) through cattle or buffaloes exalts it for bovines, (b) through normal susceptible rabbits (not previously affected with pasteurellosis) exalts it for rabbits, but attenuates it further for bovines, and (c) through rabbits that have passed through a natural outbreak of " rabbit septicæmia " attenuates it for both rabbits and bovines. The serum prepared for use against bovine hæmorrhagic septicæmia had no effect in mitigating an outbreak of rabbit pasteurellosis; the last named condition appeared to be set up by strains of organisms that were serologically identical with each other but different from those of bovine hæmorrhagic septicæmia. The re- searches on this disease were executed nearly entirely by Mr. Bennett. (d) Contagious Bovine Abortion. During the two years under report over 900 samples of serum from cattle maintained at the Government Military Dairy Farms were tested, by means of the agglutination test, for evidence as to infection with the common form of contagious bovine abortion, due to Bacillus abortus Bang. The results indicated that about 50 per cent. of the breeding animals on these establishments were infected, and the rate of clinical abortion was very high (over 20 per cent.). In order to compare the rate of infection and morbidity among Indian cattle maintained in the open, in the usual conditions in which cattle are kept in India, Mr. Bennett was deputed to conduct investigations in the Punjab during the cold weather 1923-24, upon the animals in several " grantee " herds. About 2,000 samples of serum were tested, and the results indicated an infection rate of about ten per cent., and a specific abortion rate that was almost, if not entirely, negligible. Some interesting information is being collected with regard to the varying susceptibility of the different breeds of cattle maintained at the Govern- ment Dairies; it would appear that buffaloes possess a high degree of resistance, and indigenous cattle are less susceptible to clinical abortion than are cattle with a considerable admixture of European blood. Vaccination was attempted systematically during the period under report upon the Lucknow Dairy. The first year's results, after vaccina- tion with an English strain of Bacillus abortus that had been maintained
40 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, for a very long time on culture media and had completely lost virulence, as judged from the large quantities that could be injected without ill- effect, were most disappointing, for no mitigation of the effects of the disease was observable. Towards the end of 1923, the procedure was adopted to inoculate the herd with a " virulent" strain recently isolated from the Dairy. Some anxiety was caused before the dosage rate was suitably decreased; however, the results hitherto available are encourag- ing. Work was in active progress at the close of the period upon the pos- sibilities represented by differences in virulence of strains of the causal organism isolated at the laboratory. The laboratory work was executed by Mr. Bennett. (e) Strangles. During the two strangles " seasons " included in the period under report an attempt was made to ascertain the efficacy of vaccination against the disease, by the inoculation of dead streptococci derived from a considerable number of samples of strangles pus obtained from natural cases of infection at the Remount Depots at Sargodha and Mona. About 50 strains, of varied bacteriological characteristics, entered into the production of vaccine and anti-serum. The method of treatment laid down for the 1922-23 season was to inject incoming batches of young animals in segregation at weekly in- tervals first with a dose of anti-serum and vaccine, then with two suc- cessive doses of increasing size of vaccine alone. After the lapse of nine days the young horses were to be admitted into the main depot to be exposed to infection. Unfortunately, at Mona, strangles appeared early in the segregation camps and infection spread before the full treat- ment could be carried out. At Sargodha also a proportion of the animals (47 in all) became infected before the full course of treatment was given. At both depots, a number of animals ("Late arrivals ") arrived at the depots after the treatment had begun, and they were therefore not exposed to infection concurrently with the treated animals, a propor- tion of animals were kept untreated at each depot, to serve as true " controls." The following table indicates the main results achieved, 1922-23 Season.

The number of " true controls " at Sargodha, however, was relatively very small, and the disease broke out at Mona so early that it interfered very materially with the estimation of the results of treatment. The allocation of " controls " in estimating the effect of any treatment upon a disease of this kind must necessarily be a problem of first importance, for the army records clearly showed that the rate of infection and intensity of clinical affection varied from season to season, so that fallacious deductions could readily be made from the observed effects of treatment unless an adequate number of animals were left untreated concurrently with the vaccination of any batch of animals. Consequently, for the 1923-24 season plans were laid down for the setting apart of a sufficient number of " true " controls. Also, the recently published method of Dreyer for the preparation of a so- called "diaplyte" vaccine seem plausible, and the success reported following upon its use in the treatment of tuberculosis merited attention. The rationale of the method resides in the assumption that organisms which are "acid-fast" or "gram-fast" contain impermeable (waxy) substances in their bodies which render them resistant to attack by the tissues. If these substances are " extracted " by the action of acetone after preliminary fixation with formalin, the organisms become more absorbable, and hence better " antigens." The vaccine used during the 1922-23 season was an " ordinary " vaccine, consisting of an emul- sion of cultures of streptococci killed by heat. In addition to the
42 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, " ordinary " vaccine, an "extracted" vaccine was prepared for trial during the 1923-24 season, and also anti-serum against each, of the vac- cines, to be administered simultaneously with the first dose of vaccine. Each incoming batch of remounts admitted into the depot was to be divided into three lots,MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31 ST MARCH, 1924 43 development of infection at the depot is illustrated in the following table:44 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, mortality from strangles, and that continued treatment with the "ex- tracted " form of vaccine yields superior results to those obtained with a vaccine made in the " ordinary " way from dead streptococci. Ne- vertheless, one is bound to admit that the efficacy of either form of in- tervention, when compared, for example, with the success obtainable in the prophylaxis of rinderpest and bovine hæmorrhagic septicæmia, leaves very much to be desired. Perhaps, the recent indications of Brocq- Rousseu, Forgeot, and Urbain upon the rapid antigenic changes that take place in the strangles streptococci after isolation in artificial culture media may afford a key to the relative inefficacy of the ordinary means of prophylactic inoculation against strangles. Researches based upon these conceptions are being continued at the laboratory. The infor- mation now available in regard to the common methods of prophylaxis would not have been available without the hearty and efficient cooper- ation of Major W. N. Rowston, R.A.V.C., and Captain R. E. Bond, R.A.V.C., Veterinary Officers in charge of the " country-bred " Remount Depôts at Sargodha and Mona, respectively. The clinical data supplied by these officers left nothing to be desired. Trials have also been made at the breeding depôt at Ahmednagar, in collaboration with Major G. W. Williamson, R.A.V.C., Veterinary Officer in charge, but the results of the tests are still to be awaited. (f) Contagious Equine Abortion. As stated in the last Annual report of the laboratory, methods of controlling the common form of equine contagious abortion, due to Bacillus abortivo-equinus, were taken up for study. The application of the agglutination test to the breeding animals upon the Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, Punjab, had indicated that infection was serious and widespread, and hence an attempt was made by periodic testing of all animals on the Farm, every 3 to 6 months, and the segregation of reactors, to stay the ravages of the infection. The application of the test for over two years did not enable us to attain the desired degree of control, but the prospects will be stated more clearly in the next annual report. Systematic tests were also conducted upon a number of other studs, notably two large remount breeding studs in the Punjab and the Ahmednagar Remount Depôt. It would appear that on one of these establishments the disease is gaining a foothold, while on others the natural conditions for the spread of infection limit the incidence of abortion to a small recurring, but varying, annual percentage. The results of serological tests conducted at the laboratory until the end of the period under report were:MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 45 In the agglutination test upon sera obtained from the animals in an infected stud, the distinction between reactors and non-reactors is often not a sharp one, as is usually observable in applying the method for the detection of infection with common form of contagious bovine abortion, 46 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, the various stages in its development to adverse circumstances, includ- ing the action of such drugs as are ordinarily used in treatment. In experimental conditions it was found that the average number of eggs laid by an ovigerous female was seventeen to eighteen, and that 10 days was the maximum duration of life of this female. The interval between hatching of the larva from the egg and the attainment of adolescence was 6 to 8 days. Ovigerous and pubescent females could withstand the adverse influence of separation from their host better than could the other stages; males and small larvae were most sensitive in this respect, nymphs and large larvae intermediate. Exposure to sunshine prolonged the viability of the various stages, while cold produced the opposite effect. The action of 10 per cent. creosote in olive oil was fatal in 20 minutes at 31°C. for all males, nymphs, larvae, and the majority of pubescent and ovigerous females. With regard to the eggs it was found that the period taken for hatch- ing varied from one to two days at summer temperature, and two to three days at winter temperature. No egg separated from its host for more than five days hatched subsequently when placed in the incubator at 25-27°C ; after seven days at room temperature (10-13°C) no egg hatched when placed afterwards on the host's body. Contact with 10 per cent. of creosote in olive oil for 30 minutes killed all eggs; only a few survived exposure for 20 minutes. Unfortunately the experiments could not be continued during the 1923-24 season, as the amount of material available, due to reduction in the number of buffaloes used at Muktesar, was very small. A paper was read on the subject by Mr. Timoney at the Fifth Ento- mological Meeting, held at Pusa in February 1923. (i) Tuberculosis. At the Second Meeting of Veterinary Officers in India held at Calcutta in FebruaryMUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 47 placed at his disposal for the work to be carried out. In the first place, arrangements were made for a preliminary experiment upon the relative susceptibility of the indigenous breeds vis-à-vis a known European strain of bovine virus. Twelve calves of each of the following kinds of cattle were subjected to the standard form of artificial infection at Izatnagar during the cold weather season, 1923-24 :48 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, (k) Bovine Coccidiosis. A very exhaustive study of this condition, was made during the years under report by Mr. Cooper. It is rather extraordinary that the significance of this infection had not been appre- ciated before in India, for examinations at the laboratory have shown that nearly all cattle brought in from the vicinity are carriers of coccidia in their alimentary tract. It is not unlikely from the information already to hand that the infection is also widespread in the plains. The applica- tion of the Sheather flotation method to the examination of faeces has rendered relatively easy the detection of carriers, and the computation of variations in the intensity of infection. The studies conducted at the laboratory have been directed partly towards obtaining knowledge in regard to the nature and life-history of the coccidia infecting cattle, and also very notably towards obtaining precise information concerning the relationship of a rinderpest infection to resuscitation in virulence of the dormant coccidia. A striking phenomenon frequently observed in following the course of clinical rinderpest is that the animals succumb, not to the direct action of the rinderpest infection, but to a complicating sequela manifested in the form of dysentery and exhaustion due to sudden multiplication in large numbers of coccidia in the depressed intestinal mucosa. Some observations were also made upon coccidiosis in other animals. (l) Piroplasmosis. The amount of precise information upon the piroplasms of cattle in India that was available in the technical literature was very small, considering how well these protozoan parasites had been studied elsewhere in the world. It was surprising to find that in the minds of veterinary workers the detection of any piroplasm in a blood smear from an ox was taken to indicate infection with the causative agent of tropical " red-water." At the laboratory the staff employed in the routine examination of smears from cattle that showed febrile symp- toms differentiated the intracorpuscular parasites discoverable into "large" and "small" piroplasms, without giving any more exact information concerning the nature of the bodies. In the organisation of the examination of routine material for research information, the supervi- sion of microscopic diagnosis of the blood films forthcoming daily was entrusted mainly to Mr. Cooper, and a system of recording laid down, whereby indications could be obtained as to the distribution and nature of piroplasm-infection in cattle used at the laboratory; officers visiting the laboratory for training were also made to take a share in this important form of practical disease investigation. In the records of the year 1922-23, there appeared among 4,325 smears examined positive evidence of infec- tion in 504 smears, of which 80 were stated to be infected with a large piroplasm (Piroplasma bigeminum) and 220 with "small piroplasms." On investigation of representative smears infected with the latter type it struck me that all the small parasites conformed exactly with the descriptions given by authorities (the Sergents and others) of Theileria mutans, The large piroplasm was undoubtedly Piroplasma (Babesia) bigeminum. The conformation of these parasites was then displayed clearly to the staffs entrusted with smear examination, with the result
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 49 that, with increased experience, during the year 1923-24, out of 5,158 blood smears examined, Theileria mutans was definitely demonstrated in 1,368, and Piroplasma bigeminum in 244. These figures represent chiefly the proportion of microscopically demonstrable infection in cattle passing through a rinderpest reaction, and hence may be regarded to a considerable degree as indicating parasites resuscitated by the tissue depression from their dormant or " carrier " state. Much information is, however, required concerning the infectivity and pathogenecity of parasites designated by the name Theileria mutans. It is not improb- able that all cattle in India are infected with this kind of. parasite, and that the infection is not productive of any serious effects upon the host. It is important to impress upon the minds of field worker, particularly those who are in charge of the active immunisation of cattle against rinderpest, that the detection of these small piroplasms in the blood, even in relatively large numbers, is not necessarily a sign that the animal is exposed to grave risk. Infection with the large piroplasm, however, even in small numbers, or in numbers too small to be detected, by an ordinary microscopic examination, may be fraught with serious con- sequences, and steps should be taken immediately to forestall its further development; fortunately, we now have in trypanblau a drug which checks most effectively disease due to the parasite provided it is given in timely, adequate dosage. In the routine instructions issued from the laboratory for the active immunisation of cattle against rinderpest it is now recommended, therefore, that animals showing a sudden rise of temperature after injection of the virulent blood, derived probably from a bovine infected with the red-water piroplasm, should be admi- nistered trypanblau if they show any suspicious sudden rise of tempera- ture at the expiry of the presumed incubation period of infection with this parasite, seven to ten days usually after the injection. A discovery of very considerable importance was made by Mr. Cooper in the course of the organised examination of routine pathological material at the laboratory. On June 12th, 1922, a hill bull was examined post- mortem that had died 17 days after inoculation with rinderpest virus, and the lesions discoverable bore a suspicious resemblance to those of the East Coast fever of African cattle. Microscopic examination of the lesions revealed in abundance structures quite indistinguishable from the so- called " Koch's blue bodies " associated with the African disease and an extremely rich infection of the red blood cells with piroplasms iden- tical in appearance to Theileria parva, the causal organism of the disease. During a period of exactly one month following upon this discovery a total of six cases of similar infection in cattle was detected, but other- wise throughout the rest of the year no more cases were found in the 1,248 bovines examined post-mortem. During the 1923-24 season three undoubted cases of this kind of affection were detected, and rare Koch's bodies were believed to be found in the large mononuclear cells of a liv- ing animal, that afterwards recovered. Of the six 1922-23 animals, five died within 5 to 17 days after infection with rinderpest virus, while one was a recently purchased bull that had not been used for any
50 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, experimental work. The three 1923-24 animals were not affected with rinderpest; one was taken in for use in a blackquarter experiment, one had been discontinued for some time from a rinderpest test, and one was a calf containing a large admixture of European blood that died in an outkraal. The lesions found post-mortem attributable to the peculiar piroplasm infection in the animals were, invariably, very striking enlarge- ment of the spleen and usually of the lymphatic glands and infarcts of kidney, which, however, were few and ill-defined except in one case, and hence the gross pathological picture differed somewhat from that observable, in the African disease. Transmission experiments, by direct inoculation of infected spleen pulp or by tick feeding, failed. Having in mind the pathological phenomena observable in the affection, the failure to transmit the disease experimentally, and the close resemblance- of the piroplasms found within the red blood cells to those seen in the Theileria mutans infection, except that they were usually much richer and there was a tendency for the preponderance of one morphological type, it occurred to me that the infective agent of the condition that bore the resemblance to East Coast fever was not unlikely merely a high- ly exalted or virulent variant of the common Theileria mutans, which. perhaps had gained special pathogenic properties in the body of a highly susceptible host. The work of Brumpt in Paris with an Algerian strain of Theileria mutans passaged through French cattle, that are normally free from infection with this parasite, afterwards came to my notice, and from his investigations it would appear that the mutans parasite can be exalted so as to produce an affection like East Coast fever, with, the presence of plasmatic bodies in the lymphatic tissue. The preparations containing the " blue bodies " found in animals at Muktesar were shown to Sir Arnold Theiler during his visit to Muktesar in February 1924, and he declared that they were undoubtedly what he called Theileria bodies. The fact that in East and South Africa, East Coast fever breaks out with all the epizootiological characteristics of a disease caused by a parasite of highly fixed pathogenicity makes it diffi- cult, however, to admit without considerable demur that the parva type of parasite is specifically identical with the mutans type. How- ever, for further reasons that will be published later in an extended technical paper we believe that there is no need to create a generic term other than Theileria to designate the mutans parasite. Some observations and experimental work were performed in the laboratory upon suspected Anaplasma bodies in the blood of cattle ; in the routine smears, 16 specimens in 1922-23, and 10 in 1923-24 were found to contain bodies identical in appearance with the structures held to be parasitic in nature that go by this name. However, we are not in a position to make any pronouncement on this subject at present. Two cases only of infection with Plasmodium bubalis were discovered in this period in buffaloes. (m) Minor researches. Among interesting studies conducted at the- laboratory on a lesser scale may be mentioned an enquiry by Mr. Bennett
MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 51 into the micro-organisms responsible for affections of the very young equines in India. From "joint-ill" material there was isolated Bac- terium viscosum equi for the first time in this country ; from the joint cavity of another specimen affected with this condition there was grown a peculiar fusiform organism in pure culture ; from the joint cavity of an aborted foetus there was isolated in pure culture a haemolytic strep- tococcus, pointing, contrary to the available authoritative evidence, to intra-uterine infection with this type of organism. Numerous examinations were made upon an enzootic form of pleuro- pneumonia affecting lambs in a certain district in Madras. Exhaustive bacteriological tests were made upon a complicated apparatus set up for the " hyperimmunization " of rinderpest serum producers. These tests showed that massive contamination with pyogenic organisms was inevitable owing to the insurmountable difficulty of pro- viding for effective sterilisation of the tubular portions of the apparatus. The simple procedures previously adopted involving the use of plain easily sterilisable vessels were therefore resumed. Tests were also made upon the efficacy of certain preservatives other than carbolic acid for anti-sera. It was found that the addition of this chemical in the usual half per cent. quantity did not prevent the rapid growth of certain, relatively phenol-fast, organisms, notably staphy- lococci. Ortho-cresol, pure, at 0.35 per cent. concentration, was, however, the most effective of the series tried, but short of sterilising the serum the addition of phenol preservative was found to have a very marked effect upon the keeping qualities of the serum in antibodies. Further tests upon the factors involved in the preservation of the anti- body content of serum were under execution by Mr. Bennett at the close of the period. During the 1922-23 season the active immunization against rinder- pest of the Pusa herd was undertaken by Mr. Bennett, and again at the commencement of the 1923-24 season the Government Military Dairy herds at Lahore and Ambala were inoculated by him ; the Luck- now and Sitapur herds were inoculated by Mr. Haddow, and the herd belonging to the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry and Dairying at Bangalore and the herd at Wellington were inoculated by Mr. Cooper. A considerable amount of information was collected in this manner upon the factors that make for the safety of the method. A few examinations were made at the laboratory upon " bursattee " material, and although intense eosinophilia could be detected invariably in specimens of young lesions, indicating infection of verminous origin, the actual presence of a worm parasite was not discovered. Specimens of tissues from cattle suspected to be affected with Johne's disease were examined, with positive results. Neoplasms, comprising carcinoma, adeno-carcinoma, round-celled sarcoma, and papilloma, were diagnosed in the specimens forwarded to the laboratory for examination. Specimens from a number of Army " debilitated " horses revealed intense verminous infestation.
52 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, It was intended at the commencement of the period to prosecute major researches upon Kumri in horses, and materials were collected for the purpose, but pressure of other work precluded the execution of anything more than preliminary experiments. In the post-mortem houses the carcases of 2,222 animals were systematically examined in 1922-23 (cattle 1,248, buffaloes 164, horses 15, donkeys 3, sheep 10, goats 7, dogs 83, cat 1, rabbits 676, guinea- pigs 14, pigeon 1) and of 3,318 animals in 1923-24 (cattle 1,449, buffaloes 222, horses 15, mules 2, donkey 1, sheep 7, goats 6, dogs 8, rabbits 1,591, guinea-pigs 13, rat 1, fowls 3). A special note of commendation must be paid to Veterinary Inspector Mr. R. G. Sathe for the manner in which he assisted Mr. Cooper in this work. As will be seen from the amount of material available for study there is a pressing need for the appointment of a whole-time helminthologist upon the staff of the laboratory. A resolution was passed by the Second Meeting of Veterinary Officers in India at Calcutta in FebruaryMUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31 ST MARCH, 1924 53 leading part in the administration of the laboratory during my absence on tour in the cold weather season 1923-24. The multifarious tasks entrusted to Mr. W. Pryde Watson have been dwelt upon earlier in the report, and many important schemes of research would have been im- possible of execution without his ingenuity. Veterinary Inspectors P. C. Banerji and G. R. Viswanathan rendered highly intelligent assis- tance to the officers in charge of the research schemes of the laboratory- The services of Mr. M. J. Brett in charge of outside duties as Veteri. nary Officer and his genial manner proved to be an asset of inestimable value to the institution. During the period under report the laboratory was visited by, among other visitors, (i) Sir William Edwards, Director General, Indian Medical Service, on 8th June 1922. (ii) Mr. S. Milligan, Agricultural Adviser to the Government of India, on 11th March 1923. (iii) Colonel W. Pallin, Assistant Director, Veterinary Services, Eastern Command, on 9th June 1922. (iv) Mr. M. S. D. (now Sir Montagu) Butler, Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Education, Health and Lands, on 25th October, 1923. (v) Colonel J. W. D. Megaw, I.M.S., Principal of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, on 22nd April, 1923. (vi) The Deputy Commissioner, Naini Tal, on 18th October, 1923. (vii) Sir Arnold Theiler, K.C.M.G., Director of Veterinary Education and Research, Union of South Africa, on 7th February, 1924. (viii) M. Schem, Veterinary Service, French Indo-China, on 27th January, 1924. A great deal of invaluable information and advice was obtained from these distinguished gentlemen in the course of their visits.

70 REPORT OF THE IMPERIAL BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY, APPENDIX VI. Hæmorrhagic Septicæmia.* By R. BRANFORD, Esq., M.R.C.V.S., I.V.S., Superintendent, Government Cattle Farm, Hissar, Punjab. The annual report of the Civil Veterinary Department of this pro- vince for the official year 1921-22, states that this disease was reported from every Punjab district with the exception of Simla and Attock, and that 10,923 animals died from the disease. Presumably, there were many more deaths from this disease which were not brought to the notice of the Department. The report goes on to give some inoculation statistics which prove the great value of protective inoculation, both with protective serum in the face of an outbreak and with vaccine as a preventive in areas where the disease is endemic. Losses from this disease are even more serious than the actual figures indicate, as it is a disease which is confined almost exclusively to young stock. It may be taken as certain that at least 99 per cent. of deaths from the disease are in young animals. The very serious losses from the disease coupled with the favourable results of protective inoculations as shown in the Civil Veterinary Depart- ment Report have tempted me to tabulate the results of vaccinations since I began to use the vaccine on the Hissar Farm in 1918, in the hope that its successful use here may increase the popularity of vaccination with cattle breeders in the Province. The following table shows the incidence of this disease here since 1912 :MUKTESAR, FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING THE 31ST MARCH, 1924 71 The serum is very potent and its use invariably checked the outbreaks, but the period of immunity conferred by it is of short duration only, and in the case of severe outbreaks numerous deaths may occur, before a large herd of cattle can all be inoculated. Hence the desirability of inoculating the more susceptible animals prior to the anticipated occur- rence of outbreaks, with a protective vaccine capable of conferring a prolonged immunity, became very obvious. Such a vaccine is now available from the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Muktesar. The use of a vaccine in the case of this particular disease is simplified for two reasons :CALCUTTA GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PRESS 8, HASTINGS STREET
