REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1892. No. 4750½. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL J. G. PILOHER, F.R.C.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 3rd May 1893. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1892. 2. The health of the town of Calcutta may be estimated by the figures of the following table, showing the total number of deaths and the principal causes of mortality in the year:2 REPORT ON THE It will be seen that the general health of the town and the added area of the Suburbs was somewhat better than it had been in 1891, but in Howrah the total mortality was greater than in any one of the ten previous years. In Calcutta and the added area cholera, bowel-complaints, and fever were less fatal than in 1891, but the deaths returned under the heading " Other causes" were greater. Howrah recorded more deaths from cholera in 1892 than it had done in the previous ten years, and fever and bowel-complaints were also more fatal. The vital statistics of Calcutta show a diminished prevalence of cholera, fever, and bowel-complaints in the past year, and the hospital returns from these causes are lighter. 3.

Ratio per cent. of4 REPORT ON THE percentage of past years. This high death-rate is influenced by the admission at all the Calcutta institutions, but more especially at Howrah and the Campbell Hospitals, of persons in a hopelessly advanced stage of disease. In this and the previous year the rate of mortality among cholera patients is seen to have been higher than in any year of the decade. Although cholera was less prevalent and fatal among the general population, it was of more severe type among those admitted to hospital, the death-rate in 1892 having been 59.9 per cent. of the total treated. Excluding cholera, the death-rate has varied very little in the past eleven years, and was 11.3 per cent. in 1892. 7. The following table gives the mortality among men, women, and children in the last three years:5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. There is but slight variation in the percentage of deaths among patients so classified, and the figures of the table speak for themselves. Referring again to the large mortality at the Howrah and Campbell Hospitals, it will be seen that, while the death-rate of the Campbell Hospital among men, women, and children remained about the same during the last three years, there has on the whole been greater success in 1892 in the treatment of house-patients at Howrah. 8. The diseases from which in-patients suffered and the resulting mortality is given in the following table for each institution separately, but in statement II in the appendix is shown the diseases of both in-door and out-door patients.

Dental Surgery.18 REPORT ON THE The actual number of deaths and the death-rate per cent. of the treated wereCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 others, it demands the most anxious attention and concern of the medical officers of the institution, both in regard to the sufferers themselves and in the sanitary surroundings of all patients in the maternity and other departments. His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor at a recent visit suggested the best means of treating cases of septicæmia in isolating them in a separate ward on admission, and this suggestion has taken practical shape in the selection of a site and the preparation of plan for a suitable building near the Eden Hospital. 42. The major operations performed at the Eden Hospital were 365, or 129 more than in 1891. Here, again, the increase of the past year was in some measure due to the alterations in the classification of operations, though a larger number of operations were performed. The more important were20 REPORT ON THE 51. At the Campbell Hospital, also, some improvements have been made in the nursing arrangements, and the Superintendent reports that he is hoping for still further efficiency in this department in time to come. 52. At the Presidency General Hospital there was, on an average, 26 nurses, including probationers, daily employed in the wards. 53. At the Medical College Hospital there are 1 matron, 30 nurses, and 3 probationers. At the Eden Hospital 1 matron, 3 ward, 14 pupil, and 3 private nurses. There is also a staff of dhais, 2 for out-nursing, 8 as pupils, 8 for the wards, and 4 are private dhais. 54. The pupil-nurses and dhais are under tuition at the expense of Govern- ment, and the progress these women have shown in the special subjects taught them is reported to have been most satisfactory. The greater length of time which they are required to be under instruction, considerably longer than the course given to nurses in England, must ensure greater competence of these most desirable and helpful attendants of the sick. Fourteen pupil nurses passed out of the Eden Hospital during 1892 and obtained the usual certificate of qualifi- cation. Two of these are said to have been specially intelligent and proficient. Eight pupil-dhais also qualified themselves, some of them obtaining suitable employment at once. 55. My predecessor visited the following hospitals:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 contributed by Government towards the expenditure of the several hospitals was as follows:22 REPORT ON THE Dues Fund and paying patients. The cost of establishment shows an increase of Rs. 3,425-0-5, due to the promotion of the Superintendent and of two assistant Apothecaries, to the payment of leave allowance to the First Resident Surgeon and salary to his locum tenens. There was an increase of Rs. 148-2-3 under the head of bazar medicines, and Rs. 4,477-11-1 under that of Europe medicines, which was caused by the larger number of patients treated. It is further stated that in 1892 a larger supply of medicines and new instruments was obtained. The increase of Rs. 5,290-9 in the cost of diet is also attributed to the greater number of sick treated. The average cost of daily diet was annas 8-9, the same as in 1891. The Superintendent remarks:23 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 63. Police Hospital.24 REPORT ON THE 67. Howrah General Hospital.25 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. March to 23rd April, and Surgeon Captain Leahy from 24th April to 9th November. 70. The total number of in-door patients treated was 7,054, against 6,803 in 1891, and the daily average numbers were 400.79 and 371.77 respectively. There were 744 deaths, against 632 in the previous year. The death-rate was 11.41 per cent., against 10.07 in 1891. These figures are calculated on cases excluding those treated in the Ophthalmic Hospital, where 534 patients were treated, against 531 in 1891. The increased death-rate in 1892 is accounted for by the admission of a larger number of moribunds and of cases in the last stage of disease. Excluding "other classes," which have hitherto been included among "Europeans," the total number of Europeans and Eurasians treated as in-door patients in 1892 was 2,450, against 2,338 in 1891. The daily average number of European patients in 1892 was 141.86, and the total number of deaths among them 117, or 4.77 per cent. Similar figures for 1891 cannot be given, owing to the inclusion of other classes noted above. There were treated 3,904 native in-patients (Hindus and Mussalmans), against 3,711 in 1891, the daily average numbers being 232.06 and 208.91 respectively. Among native patients there were 576 deaths in 1892, or 14.75 per cent., against 486 and 13.09 respectively in 1891. The increase in the mortality is chiefly attributed to the hopeless condition of some of the patients. The number of in-door patients grouped under the head "other classes" was 700, and the daily average 26.87 in 1892. Among these patients there were 51 deaths, or 7.28 per cent. The number of this class of patients treated in 1891 was 754, but owing to the reason pointed out above the daily average and the number of deaths among them cannot be furnished. The total number of out-door patients treated was 54,660, against 56,227 in 1891, the daily average numbers being 394.11 and 407.36 respectively. 71. A new latrine block at the west end of the hospital was constructed with all recent improvements. A separate arrangement was made for the supply of drinking water. This was hitherto obtained from the iron tanks which also supplied water to the latrine. Two rooms were constructed for the Registrar's office and medical officers' board room. A large room on the south side of the hospital, hitherto used for ophthalmic and other cases, was converted into a dispensary. The drainage of the Eden Hospital was improved. The Officiating Principal remarks:26 REPORT ON THE from dysentery fell from 94 to 45, but that from diarrh27 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 80.7, against 82.2 in 1891. There were 228 deaths, or a rate of 12.98 per cent. against 295 and 15.65 respectively in 1891. Regarding this diminution in the death-rate the Superintendent says that cholera, malarial fevers, and diseases of liver were less prevalent, and the mortality from these causes, as well as from general injuries, was also less than in 1891. The total number of out-door patients was 27,508, against 28,700 in 1891. The daily average number was 174.8, against 181.4 in the previous year. 80. Chandney Hospital.APPENDIX.

MEDICAL. No. 2089Med. CALCUTTA, THE 19TH JUNE 1893. RESOLUTION. READ( 2 ) 3. Of the total number of persons treated during the year, 154,492 were adult males, 37,707 adult females, and 59,784 children, against 153,705, 34,678, and 56,753 respectively in 1891. The statistics according to race show that there was an increase of all classes of patients except Hindus. The increase of European patients is said to be due chiefly to the increased population of the port, brought about by the stagnation of trade and the large number of vessels detained in the river, and to the popularity of the out-door department of the Eden Hospital. The number of Hindu patients decreased in all the hospitals except Howrah, the total falling off being 3,155; but the year 1891 showed an advance of 7,297 upon the figures of 1890, and the fluctuation in 1892 is probably fortuitous. 4. The rate of mortality among the inmates of the medical institutions was practically the same as in several past years, viz., 12.7 per cent. The death-rate as usual was highest in the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals, where pauper and moribund cases are sent for treatment. The death-rate among children was lower than that among adults which is 60 per cent. higher than the average rate of English Hospitals. 5. There was a slight increase in the small-pox cases treated in the hospitals, the numbers being 35 against 21 in the previous year. All of these cases were admitted in the Campbell Hospital and 10 of them proved fatal. This the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals thinks is indicative of the absence of protection by vaccination in at least half the number of cases. In order to afford grounds for further conclusions, the Lieutenant-Governor desires that the number of patients who can be seen by their marks to have been vaccinated, or inoculated, or to have had small-pox, and the proportion of deaths among them, should be stated in future reports. Results so remarkable have been obtained from observation of an outbreak of small-pox in the Dacca Jail during 1892, that His Honour desires that particular attention should be given to recording the past medical history of small-pox patients, and the previous efforts, if any, made to protect them. Seven hundred and nine persons were admitted to hospital during 1892 suffering from cholera, which in 425 cases proved fatal, giving a ratio of nearly 60 per cent. The mortality among European patients treated for this disease was higher in the General Hospital than in that attached to the Medical College. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to find that there were no cases of cholera among the patients in the Presidency General and the Campbell Hospitals, but the Medical College and the Howrah General Hospitals did not enjoy this immunity, 6 and 4 cases respectively having occurred in those institutions. These cases are said to have been due chiefly to contaminated food obtained by the patients from outside the Hospital. There was a considerable decrease in the admissions for dysentery and diarr- h( 3 ) absence of this disease from the institutions, where only native patients are received, is noticeable, especially in connexion with the belief entertained by some that the natives of this country are to a great extent free from this disease. But Dr. Pilcher remarks that this does not set aside the conviction of many careful European and Native observers that enteric fever often attacks natives of this country. The difficulty of distinguishing it from remittent fever renders any definite opinion on this subject at present impossible. The Surgeon-General with the Government of India recently enjoined extreme care in the diagnosis of the disease, in the hope that some day the key to the difference between the two diseases may be found. 6. The total number of major operations performed in all the institutions shows an increase of 1,182. The increase is said to be due in a great measure to a common class of operations (tapping for hydrocele) which have hitherto been classed at the Medical College Hospital as minor operations having under recent orders been included under this head. It is satisfactory to notice the general reduction in the percentage of death after operation from 4.5 to 3.78, and the fact that in the Howrah General Hospital it fell from 8.23 to 3.01. This result is said to be due to the care and thoroughness with which the details of antiseptic surgery have been carried out. The number of dental operations performed was 2,362 against 2,275. There was a considerable increase in the number of Europeans who sought relief for dental diseases, while the number of Eurasians fell from 894 to 760. This result hardly bears out the remarks made in para- graph 45 of the report for 1891, that the teeth of mixed are more prone to decay than those of unmixed races. 7. In the Eden Hospital 1,609 women and children were treated against 1,811 in the previous year. Of these, 832 were Europeans, 746 Hindus or Mussulmans, and 31 belonged to other classes. The daily average attendance of Europeans shows the large decrease of 33 per cent. The reduction in the number of admissions of European and native patients is attributed by Dr. Joubert to the opening of the out-door department. There were 28 deaths among Europeans and 67 among natives, as compared with 32 and 65 of the previous year. The number of confinement cases rose from 501 to 542, the mortality among this class of cases being 26 against 21 in 1891. The number of cases of septicæmia also rose from 24 to 31, giving a percentage of 5.7 on confinements as against 4.7 in 1891: of these 21 proved fatal. These figures show that the precautions reported as having been taken against the occurrence of this disease have un- fortunately not had much effect, and the Lieutenant-Governor would again dwell on the necessity of using all possible means to minimize the chance of its appearance or extension in the hospital. His Honour has already suggested that isolation is the best way of treating it, and if funds can be provided, the necessary steps will be taken to erect a separate ward for the treatment of this disease, 8. The steady increase in the number of out-patients treated in the Shama Churn Law Eye Infirmary points to the growing popularity of the Institution. The principal operations performed were extraction of lens, iridectomy and excision of the eye-ball. The operations for cataract were successful in 61 per cent. of the cases which compares unfavourably with the results in the Howrah Hospital, where the operations were successful in 87 per cent. of the cases treated. 9. In the Ezra Hospital, which is intended chiefly for the sick of the Jewish persuasion, 1,555 out-patients and 350 in-patients were treated, the daily average attendance being 10.6 and 16.91 respectively against 12.63 and 16.73 in 1891. These low figures hardly bear out the Inspector-General's remarks that the Institution has fulfilled the beneficent object of its founder. 10. The nursing arrangements of the Medical College and General Hospitals continue to work satisfactorily: grateful testimony to the efficiency and skill of the nurses is frequently received, and the Lieutenant-Governor desires to place on record his appreciation of the good work done by them. Two trained European nurses have been employed in the Howrah General Hospital, but they are not connected with the Hospital Nurses' Institution. Fourteen pupil nurses and eight pupil dhais passed out of the Eden Hospital. 11. The invested capital belonging to the hospitals remains the same as in, 1891, viz., Rs. 5,83,000, of which more than half belongs to the Mayo Institutions.

In the Medical College Hospital a new latrine block has been erected, and improved arrangements have been made for the supply of drinking water. Two rooms were constructed for the Registrar's office and the Medical officer's board-room, and other minor improvements have been effected. All of them were much needed, and the Lieutenant-Governor is glad that they have been carried out. 14. The existing provision for meeting the medical wants of the town has more than once been declared to be insufficient by the Local Government, and this opinion was endorsed by the Government of India in July 1892. Accord- ingly, after the close of the year under review, a Committee was appointed to report on the necessity for providing further accommodation and the localities where it should be afforded. They have suggested the establishment of a hospital at Bhowanipur, and four out-door dispensaries in Wards Nos. 3, 19, 20, and. 22 respectively: their proposals have received the full assent of Govern- ment, and the difficulty of providing funds for the work alone retards is commencement. 15. The report brings into striking prominence the insignificant extent to which the medical charities of Calcutta are supported by voluntary contribu- tions. Out of a total income of rather more than five lakhs of rupees, as much as Rs. 3,15,000 were contributed by Government, while the subscriptions from Europeans and Natives aggregated only Rs. 11,818 and Rs. 1,371 respectively. In other words, out of every Rs. 100 spent in 1892 on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta, the proportion voluntarily contributed by those whose countrymen form 81 per cent. of the patients treated was less than five annas. The Lieuten- ant-Governor would be glad to see part of the great stream of native charity turned into this most useful channel. 16. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor are due to Surgeon-Colonel Pilcher for a clear and concise report, and for the promptitude with which it has been submitted.

SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the report of the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1893. 2. The following table gives the deaths and the chief causes of mortality in Calcutta, Howrah, and the amalgamated area of the Suburbs during the year, and for the previous ten years:2 REPORT ON THE Calcutta, about the same in Howrah, and a good deal higher in the Suburbs. The increase in bowel-complaints and fever was no doubt due to the heavy and prolonged rainfall of the year, and this would naturally affect the Suburbs more than the town. In the former the water lodges and the soil becomes sodden; in the latter it is largely carried off by the sewers. The increased deaths in the suburban area from fever and bowel-complaints more than account for the increase in mortality. The hospital and dispensary figures coincide generally with these results. 3. Numbers treated.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 Mayo is due to the hospital having been open throughout the year, whereas it was closed for repairs for two months of 1892. The small increase at the Chandney Hospital requires no explanation. 5.

Europeans diminished by 882, chiefly, no doubt, owing to there being fewer sailors in port, as 592 out of the total decrease was at the Presidency General Hospital and Howrah. There were 83 fewer women and 45 fewer children treated at the Eden Hospital, owing, in the opinion of the Obstetric Physician, to cases which would formerly have been admitted being now treated as out-patients. This explanation is, I think, reasonable, since patients who can be treated as out-patients naturally prefer remaining at home to coming into hospital. Eurasians increased by 1,024, Muhammadans by 7,089, Hindus by 16,663, and other classes by 2,240. 6. Mortality was as shown in the following table:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 7.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 Performed in the Calcutta Medical Institutions during 189318 REPORT ON THE The classification is the same as last year, and there is a diminution of 64 in the total number as compared with 1892. There were 110 deaths, or 3.15 per cent., against 134, or 3.78 per cent., in 1892. The mortality cannot be fairly compared with the rates of previous years, however, since many opera- tions formerly classed as minor, and which involve little or no danger to life, are now included in the list. This fact must be kept in mind in comparing the figures of different hospitals. All operations are in one sense " important." A man with a cinder in his eye is, till it is removed, as helpless as the victim of a great surgical injury, but the "operation" required to relieve him requires no surgical skill. The opening of an abscess may involve issues of life or death, but is in itself a very simple proceeding. Classification is necessary to allow of comparison, and every classification is open to criticism; the point to be remembered is that until the returns are analysed no comparisons are possible, and that an institution may show a large number of major operations while doing very little high surgery. The operations are important in the sense noted above, yet may require very little diagnostic skill or manual dexterity, and the man who does them may be no surgeon. The real surgical work of Calcutta is done at the Medical College, Eden, Shama Charn Law and Mayo Hospitals, followed longo intervallo by Howrah, the Presidency General Hospital and Sealdah, while the majority of major operations among out-patients at all the institutions, and most of those at Sealdah and the Chandney Hospitals are of comparative unimportance in a surgical sense. A curious feature in the present classification is the omission of operations for the setting of fractures. The successful treatment of a bad compound fracture involves as anxious work as almost any surgical case, and is an excellent test of surgical ability and resource. Yet it counts for nothing in the surgical record of the year. In this way Howrah is deprived of credit for much most excellent surgery, 47 fracture cases having been treated during the year. 25. Minor operationsCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 performed from 1870 to 1877, 61 died, or 43.26 per cent.; of 32 similarly classified including two cases remaining from the previous year in 1893, 3 died, or 9.37 per cent. The result is due to the gradual introduction of sanitary improve- ments and to the adoption of a most intelligent and thorough system of antiseptic treatment. It would be even better than it is, but for the fact that many patients are admitted every year in a condition little favourable to recovery, and this is especially the case in the obstetric department. Since this was transferred to the Eden Hospital, the sanitary surroundings of the patients have been enormously improved, yet the death-rate after operations has always been high, and must remain so until the people learn to come to hospital in time, and not delay, as is too frequently the case, till an operation, however skillfully performed, is too late to save life. 27. The Presidency General Hospital20 REPORT ON THE restored, 10.34 per cent. more were partially relieved, while the remainder, though no better, were no worse than they were. It must be remembered that in Europe a cataract is never operated on till fully ripe. In India, unless a patient is operated on at once, he will not remain in hospital, so that no preparation is possible, and cases have to be taken as they come. If excellent hygienic surroundings and perfect operative skill were the sole factors, the percentage of cures should equal the operations. 30.

The report gives in detail particulars of every fatal case, which need not be repro- duced, but may be summarised so far as deaths after delivery are concerned, as shown in the table. Of 22 additional deaths among European women, 5 were due to puerperal complications after confine- ment in their own homes, 2 were moribund on admission, 4 occurred from fever and anæmia, 4 from malignant disease, and the remainder from a variety of causes. Of the 20 deaths in native women not follow- ing delivery in hospital, 3 were returned as moribund, but no less than 14 others were practically so, and died within two or three days after admission. 39. The death-rates among children of all classes are very high, but this is due to a large proportion of them being brought to hospital in a dying condition. This is clearly brought out in the deaths among native children, where 14 out of 15 occurred within three days of admission, and of 28 deaths in European children 19 occurred within three days.

Many of the general operations were of supreme importance. A very notable fact is the increase in the number of abdominal sections. It was formerly a fixed belief that these operations were not suited to India, and they can hardly be called established even yet, since the operations are confined to the capital towns and a few provincial dispensaries. They should number thousands yearly instead of tens. When performed under favourable conditions, they are quite as successful as in other countries, and the reason for the high mortality in India is that most patients suffering from ovarian or other disease calling for laparo- tomy delay the operation so long that its risk is multiplied by many times. An average case at the Eden Hospital is far worse than most of those met with elsewhere. Cases are, however, beginning to come earlier, and the numbers are increasing yearly, the measure of success improving also. All the ovariotomy cases recovered. The death shown in the return was a case remaining from 1892. Two of the colotomy cases died, but it was the disease and not the operation which killed them. One of the hysterectomies ended fatally. A few years ago this operation was considered unjustifiable, as ovariotomy had been twenty years before. Seventy-five per cent. of the remaining laparotomies recovered, two of the eight deaths were due to shock, three to disease and three to peritonitis. The list contains very many additional operations of great importance. The hospital is doing splendid work and becoming more and more useful every year. 42. Minor operations have not been recorded, but are said to average 20 or 30 daily. Orders were issued that a record should be kept, and it is no excuse to say, as the Superintendent says, that it cannot be kept properly. The omis- sion vitiates the returns of the institutions generally, and had orders been obeyed would have turned the decrease mentioned in paragraph 25 into a con- siderable increase. 43. Food is still cooked in the Medical College kitchen. This is and has always been the weak point in the hospital arrangements, but there are practical difficulties in the way of improvement. The arrangements for procuring hot water have been improved and cheapened. 44. The out-patient department continues to work well. Three thousand five hundred and thirty-five new cases were treated during the year, and the average daily attendance was 28.25. This department has provided most useful material for clinical instruction, and arrangements have now been made by which the girl students from Sealdah shall share in the teaching. 1892. 1893.

Contributions from local funds, chiefly increased payments from the port funds for the treatment of sick sailors, account for the balance, and make up for excess expenditure under several heads. Particulars are given in statement V, and will be commented on later on. Various items are increased owing to the inclusion of the accounts of the Dufferin Victoria Hospital for the first time. The proportion contributed by Government towards the expenditure of the different institutions is given in the margin, and shows a satisfactory reduc- tion in most cases. The increase at Sealdah is due to a larger number of sick having been treated. As the municipal grant is a fixed sum, all additional expenditure has to be borne by Government. 53. Before passing on to the accounts of individual institutions it will be convenient for purposes of comparison to glance briefly at the different items of expenditure separately, with the cost per capita.

The difficulty of drawing comparisons is further illustrated by the fact that at the Mayo Hospital only Rs. 525 of the Superintendent's pay is charged to the Hospital, at Howrah nothing, the Civil Surgeon giving his services free, while at the Campbell Hospital there is an allowance of Rs. 300.

Compounders and dressersCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 27 General Hospital spends Rs. 47-13-11. The rate at the Medical College Hospi- tal seems very moderate, considering that a large number of its patients are Europeans, and its requirements for surgical dressings for operation cases very great. The high figure at the Dufferin Victoria Hospital is due solely to bad management. Medicines have been bought locally month by month at a cost of at least 33 per cent. more than was necessary. The rates at the Presidency General Hospital appear at first sight to point to extravagance, as compared with the Medical College Hospital. The Superintendent could not account for the difference, but was convinced that the medicines had been actually used, and pointed out that after all the expenditure was less than a rupee a week for each sick European. It seemed at first impossible to analyse the component parts of the expenditure on medicines at the Medical College Hospital so as to show the relative share for Europeans and natives, no separate accounts being kept. Calculating the matter out, however, on the assumption that European patients should cost about the same at both hospitals, and that the Campbell, Police and Mayo Hospitals give about the true rates for natives, I find that at the rate of Rs. 48 for a European and Rs. 6 for a native, the expenditure on medicines at the Medical College Hospital would be in round numbers Rs. 12,594. It was Rs. 12,976, so that the hypothetical explanation is probably correct or nearly so. I think, however, there is room for economy in the matter of medicines in both hospitals. Europeans. Natives.

Diet.28 REPORT ON THE but I hope that attention having been called to the subject they may become still more uniform in future. I do not think there is any real extravagance anywhere. In 1877 the cost of European diets was at the Presidency General Hospital 10 annas 3½ pies, at the Medical College Hospital 9 annas 4 pies, at Howrah, where 85 per cent. were paying patients, 12 annas 7 pie, so that the present cost is much less than formerly. As regards diets for natives, the cost at the Campbell, Chandney, Howrah, and Police Hospitals approximate each other very closely (average 2 annas 6 pies); so do the Medical College Hospital, Dufferin Victoria Hospital, and Mayo Hospital, (average 3 annas 3¼ pies), but the latter group are on the average 9¼ pies higher than the former. The Mayo Hospital was in 1877 the best and most economically managed of the Calcutta hospitals. It then fed its patients at the rate of 2 annas 7CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 29 Darjeeling Eden Sanitarium, and there was a smaller demand for special and particular drugs not included in the Government lists. A donation of Rs. 500 given by His Highness the Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior was invested during the year. 64. Chuni Lal Seal's Dispensary30 REPORT ON THE paper at a cost of Rs. 529-7-1, but the total capital of the hospital is only Rs. 1,500. Considering the relief it gives to an enormous number of the most miserable classes, it deserves better treatment than it receives. The municipal contribution of Rs. 30,000 was fixed many years ago when the average number of sick was about 300, and was roughly calculated at Rs. 100 a bed. It was distinctly understood (vide page i, Appendix G of Sir Ashley Eden's Hospital Committee's report) that it was to be increased if the numbers grew. They are now nearly 500, and the municipal grant should be increased. The net cost to Government in 1893 was Rs. 48,168-1-2. A separate surgical ward, though sanctioned, has not been begun for want of funds. A similar ward for obstetric and gynæcological cases is much wanted; so are a drying room for clothing and a hostel for girl students.

The above figures show a satisfactory increase of 25,287 in the number of out-door patients treated and of 155 in their daily average attendance. This increase is distributed over all the institutions, excepting the Medical College Hospital, the Chandney Hospital, and the Howrah General Hospital, and is said to be due partly to the inclusion for the first time of the statistics of the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, and partly to the increased prevalence of fever and bowel-com- plaints, while it certainly points to the growing popularity of the out-door depart- ments of the several institutions. The out-door ward of the Campbell Hospital, opened in January 1892, to the efficiency of which the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals bears testimony, has drawn away some of the patients who used formerly to attend the Medical College Hospital, but the decrease of 569 in the attendance at that institution was due to a temporary cause only. The decrease in the Howrah General Hospital was very small, while that in the Chandney Hospital was due to the fact that the admissions in the previous year had been abnormally large, owing to a severe epidemic of influenza in that neighbourhood. 4. The total number of in-door patients rose from 25,211 to 26,058. The increase occurred chiefly in the Police Hospital, the Campbell Hospital, and the Mayo Hospital, and is attributed to climatic causes, and to the high prices of food which tell chiefly on the poorer classes. Moreover, the Mayo Hospital was open for the whole of 1893, whereas it was closed for two months in 1892, and the figures for the Dufferin Hospital for women have been included for the first time. The large decrease in the Presidency and Howrah General Hospitals, which is observed chiefly in the numbers of Europeans, appears to be due to the better general health of the population in the port, since with a daily population in 1893, which was only 21/2 per cent. below that of 1892, the admissions to hospital were 25 per cent. less than in the former year. 5. Of the total number of patients, both in-door and out-door, treated in all the hospitals, 167,092 were adult males, 45,290 adult females, and 65,735 children. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 154,492, 37,707, and 59,784. There was thus an increase of 26,134 in the patients of both sexes. Of these patients, 49.06 per cent. were Hindus, next in order coming the Muhammadans, 32.61, the Eurasians 10.88, and the Europeans 3.002, The number of Europeans who sought relief in the hospitals fell from 9,233 to 8,351, owing partly to fewer sailors having visited the port, as has been stated, but chiefly to an improvement in their general health. 6. The death-rate among the inmates of the medical institutions was almost the same as that of the previous year, being 12.8, against 12.7 per cent. The proportion of deaths in the different hospitals, however, varies consider- ably, and the remarks of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals are so much to the point that they are quoted below:( 3 ) deaths. Dr. Harvey remarks that "the mere operation of vaccination conveys no protection against small-pox unless it produces the disease vaccinia, and unless this is allowed to run its course to maturity. Vaccination with bad lymph or destruction of the vesicles by the application of mud, turmeric or other drugs( 4 ) amount of general and important surgical work is done are the Medical College and the Mayo Hospitals, while the operations at the Eden and Shama Charan Law Hospitals are equally important, but of a more special character. The largest number of operations was performed at the Medical College Hospital, where the year has been one of great surgical activity, with very satisfac- tory results: the death-rate in amputation cases shows a noticeable improve ment. The major operations performed at the Campbell and the Mayo Hospitals were also numerous, and. gave a low rate of mortality, but at the former institution, beyond the amputation cases, there were very few really important operations, and the students of the Medical School at Sealdah, unlike those at Patna, Dacca, and Cuttack, had very limited opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of the higher surgery. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals does not hope for any great improvement in this respect until a proper surgical ward has been provided: the construction of such a ward has now been sanctioned, and the work is being taken in hand during the current year. The statistics of the Dufferin Hospital for women have for the first time been included in this report, and show 12 major operations. Dr. Harvey passes a severe but not undeserved condemnation upon the situation and surroundings of this hospital: his remarks will be communicated to the Secretary to the Bengal Branch of the Lady Dufferin Fund. In the Howrah General Hospital the number of major operations fell from 230 to 116, but the number is said to have been abnormally large in 1892 owing to the number of operations on the eye performed by Surgeon-Major R. D Murray, who had a special reputation in ophthalmic cases. It is, however, observed that this hospital has been deprived of credit for 47 operations for the setting of fractures which have not been included in the present classification, though this important opera- tion involves as much anxious work as any surgical case. The total number of minor operations was 19,001 against 19,880, showing a reduction of 879 cases, but it is said that no record of the minor operations performed at the Eden Hospital was maintained, which makes these statistics incomplete and accounts for the falling off noticed above. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals has taken the necessary steps to provide against such omissions in future. The number of dental operations performed during the year was 2,468 against 2,744 in the previous year. The Eurasians again head the list of persons applying for dental relief, while the number of Europeans fell from 702 to 695. 11. The number of admissions into the Eden Hospital was 1,367 against 1,546 in the previous year. The decrease is said to be due to cases of minor im- portance having been treated in the out-door department, but the attendance in that department also shows a reduction. There was, however, an increase in the average daily number of inmates, which indicates that the cases treated were severe in nature, requiring a long stay at the hospital. The death-rate among Europeans was very high, being 8.40 per cent. against 3.36 in 1892, while that among Hindus and Muhammadans shows a reduction from 8.98 to 8.42 per cent. The percentage of deaths among other classes was 12.02. There were 573 con- finement cases against 501 in 1892, of which 25 ended fatally against 26. The number of, cases of septicæmia was the same as in the previous year, viz. 31, but there were fewer deaths. A proposal for the construction of a special ward for the treatment of this disease is under consideration: such a ward is much wanted, and it is hoped that it may soon be taken in hand. The Lieutenant-Governor observes again in the statistics of this hospital proof of the lamentable tendency of natives to delay the removal of a patient to the hospital till the case is almost hopeless, but he is glad to learn that the usefulness of the institution is increasing year by year. In this hospital, 337 major operations were performed, against 365 in 1892, and death followed in 31 cases. 12. The number of in-door patients treated in the Shama Charan Law Eye Infirmary was almost the same as in the previous year, but the increase of out-door patients noticed last year has not been maintained. Most of the operations performed in this hospital were extractions of the lens, and 70.98 per cent. of these operations were entirely successful. 13. The number of out-door patients treated in the Ezra Hospital rose by 383, but that of the in-door patients was very small, being 281 against 350 in the previous year; and out of 22 beds provided in the hospital, only 14 were constantly occupied, owing, it is said, to the admission being restricted to Jews
( 5 ) to the exclusion of Parsis, Arabs, Armenians, &c., who have hitherto received admission to this institution more or less freely. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets that this fine hospital is not more used, and he desires that the terms under which the hospital was originally built and equipped should be acted up to, and the sick of all nationalities admitted when there is room for them owing to the absence of Jewish patients. If the Jewish community desire that admis- sion to this hospital should be strictly confined to the Jews, the Lieutenant- Governor must ask the wealthy members of that community to support it more liberaly. It appears that out of a total expenditure of Rs. 7,547 incurred in the hospital during 1893, only Rs. 936 was met from the endowments of the founder, and Government had to pay the balance. 14. Very great improvement is said to have been made in the nursing arrangements at the different hospitals. The Medical College, the Eden and the Presidency General Hospitals are all supplied with a number of trained nurses from the Hospital Nurses' Institution; but at the Eden Hospital the bulk of the work is said to be done by pupil nurses and pupil dhais, of whom there are 20 and 19 respectively, and the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals justly remarks that the work of the probationers cannot have been as perfect as that of the trained nurses. During the year 14 pupil nurses and 9 pupil dhais passed out of the Eden Hospital. 15. The invested capital of the Calcutta hospitals shows an increase from Rs. 5,83,000 to Rs. 5,87,000, the increase being chiefly at the Howrah General Hospital. The following table compares the main heads of receipts and expendi- ture of all the hospitals in the metropolis:( 6 ) Funds, and is due to a larger receipt from the Hospital Port Dues Fund for the treatment of sick sailors. The receipts from paying patients also rose to the extent of Rs. 1,038. The cost to Government shows a reduction of Rs. 18,818. Subscriptions from Europeans, however, show a considerable decrease, while that from natives rose from Rs. 1,371 to Rs. 3,706. The total expenditure was Rs. 4,80,931, against Rs. 4,83,770 in the previous year. The decrease was chiefly under the head of Buildings and Repairs. 17. There was a little increase under the head of Establishment, both superior and inferior. The cause of this increase has not been explained, but in paragraphs 54 to 57 of the report, the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals compares the cost of establishment on each patient treated in the different institutions, and shows that the cost was highest in the Presidency General Hospital owing, it is said, to the staff there comprising several highly paid commissioned medical officers, whose entire salary is debited to the hospital, whereas the salaries of most of the officers employed in the Medical College Hospital, are charged to the College. The variation in the cost of compounders and dressers is said to be due to a difference in book-keeping. The Inspector- General of Civil Hospitals should correct this difference by laying down a sufficient number of heads of expenditure, to which all the institutions should conform. 18. The cost of European medicines also shows an increase of Rs. 1,649, and the comparison instituted by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals of the cost per head in the different institutions shows that the cost was higher in the Presidency General Hospital than in the Medical College. The Superintendent is unable to account for this difference, but is convinced that the medicines have been actually used. Considering, however, the high cost of each European and native patient, the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals thinks that there is room for economy in both these institutions, and the Lieutenant-Governor desires that this conclusion should be enforced as far as possible. The high figures in the Dufferin Hospital are said to be due to the purchase of medicines at a high price in the local market. This defect will be amended by the arrangements recently made for obtaining medicines from England at wholesale prices, and then distributing them to the different institutions according to their requirements 19. The cost of diet also shows an increase, but the maximum rate fixed for European patients in Government order No. 1-D/24 4, dated the 4th December 1890, has not been exceeded in any of the institutions except the Campbell Hospital, where small-pox patients are treated, and where the average cost of dieting such patients is not restricted to the above maximum. In the Mayo Hospital, which at one time enjoyed the reputation of being the most economi- cally managed medical institution in Calcutta, the cost of diets for native patients in 1892 (3 annas 81/5pies) exceeded the maximum rate, and the cost in 1893 (annas 3 and 5 pies) is still above the maximum. The Lieutenant- Governor trusts that the Superintendent will devote special attention to the subject, and to Dr. Harvey's remarks in paragraph 60, and endeavour during the current year to win back for the hospital its old reputation. 20. The Lieutenant-Governor regrets that the projected Hospital for South Calcutta, from which he anticipates so much advantage to the sick poor, and the erection of which has more than once been urged by the Government of India, has not been begun during the year under review. Grave difficulties were met with in the selection of a site and in the provision of funds, but it is believed that the first of these has already been surmounted, and the Lieutenant- Governor expects that the improvement of the Provincial finances and the liberality of the Corporation of Calcutta will enable him to commence the building before the close of the current year. 21. Dr. Harvey remarks, in conclusion, that there has been a marked advance of recent years in the general efficiency of the Calcutta Medical Institutions; the work has been better done, material improvements have been introduced everywhere, the patients have been provided with greater comforts, the death-rate has been lowered, and the cost, both to Government and in general, has been diminished. This is valuable testimony from an officer who knows Calcutta well, and who has now returned to it after an absence of about three years. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor are due to Surgeon Colonel Harvey for his interesting review of the year's work and for the punctuality with
( 7 ) which it has been submitted. The report is a little longer than that of last year, but there is nothing in it which is unnecessarily minute or which the Lieutenant- Governor would like to have had omitted: on the contrary, the addition of paragraphs 53 to 62, in which the proportionate cost of different branches of expenditure is worked out, has much enhanced its value. The Lieutenant- Governor also agrees in the remarks made by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals regarding the thorough efficiency of the staff employed in the different institutions, and concurs in the praise bestowed by him on the work done by the physicians at all the Calcutta hospitalsIP/6/H6.4 REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1894.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1894. No. 4409. FROM THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF CIVIL HOSPITALS, BENGAL, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Calcutta, the 29th April 1895. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the report of the medical institutions of Calcutta for the year 1894. 2. The following table gives the deaths and the chief causes of mortality in Calcutta, Howrah, and the amalgamated area of the suburbs during the year and for the previous ten years:2 REPORT ON THE Cholera and small-pox are dependent on meteorological conditions, but the increase in the deaths from bowel-complaints and fevers is surprising unless it is due to greater accuracy in registration, for the heavy and prolonged rains of 1893 (88.75 inches) seemed to account for the unusual prevalence of these diseases in that year, while the diminished rainfall of 1894 (54.12 inches) made me anticipate a decrease in 1894. 3. Numbers treated.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 304, or nearly double, affords excellent evidence of the increasing popularity of that institution. 5. The following is the usual statement showing the number of men, women, and children treated as in and out patients at each institution classified according to race, nationality, or religion, and giving the average daily atten- dance and the percentages of men, women, and children:4 REPORT ON THE Taking in and out patients together, there was an increase of 10,836, made up of 3,992 men, 424 women, and 6,420 children. Europeans increased by 666, chiefly at the Medical College Hospital and Howrah, Eurasians by 1,694, Muhammadans by 5,090, and Hindus by 4,198, while "other classes" diminished by 812. The only feature of note is the very great proportional increase in Muhammadans, as to which no explanation is suggested in any of the reports. In 1893 the increase among Hindus was more than double that of Mussalmans. The diminution among other classes is also unexplained. 6. Mortality was as shown in the following table:5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7. The next table shows the deaths among men, women, boys, and girls in 1894 and the two previous years:6 REPORT ON THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL. PRESIDENCY GENERAL HOSPITAL. MAYO NATIVE HOSPITAL.

At Howrah a European sailor contracted cholera a week after admission. No cause could be made out. He died. The water at Howrah is bad, that at Sealdah excellent so far as it goes, but the supply has been insufficient, and unfiltered or tank water is liable to be used at times, although there is nothing to point to its having been concerned in the outbreak. 11. Professor Haffkine has continued his anti-cholera inoculation through- out the year with untiring zeal and devotion, and a considerable body of evidence has been accumulating towards the settlement of the question of its value. As stated in last yearCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 11 of 1894. The admissions from fever during 1894 are, as was to be expected, less. Why are the total mortality and the death-rate higher ? The explanation is found in the fact that the increased mortality falls entirely on the early part of the year and is really a legacy from the prolonged rains of the autumn of 1893. The total increase from fever was 1,046, but 687 of this excess occurred in the first quarter and 1,022 in the first four months, while the excess in bowel- complaints was more than accounted for in the same period. 1888 12,920 1889 12,793 1890 12,326 1891 11,886 1892 13,072 1893 14,483 1894 13,419 Primary syphilis.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 performed in the Calcutta Medical Institutions during 189420 REPORT ON THE The total number performed shows an increase of 304 as compared with that of 1893. Of this increase, 125 is accounted for by the opening of a speical department at the Medical College Hospital for the treatment of the diseases of the throat, ear and nose. There were 129 deaths, or 3.40 per cent., against 110, or 3.15 per cent., in the previous year. 25. Minor operations increased from 19,001 to 24,988 in 1894. The increase chiefly occurred in the Medical College Hospital. At the Eden Hospital a record of all operations was kept from March 1894, with the result that no less than 2,747 appear in the list of that year. Three hundred and eighty-seven opera- tions were performed in the newly-opened department for the treatment of the diseases of the throat, ear and nose. The Dufferin Hospital had an increase of 499 and the Campbell Hospital 562. The other institutions show little variations. 1893. 1894.

The Medical College Hospital had 2,135 major operations against 1,938 in 1893, showing an increase of 197. It has already been shown that 125 operations were performed in the special department opened during the year. The number of more important operations is shown in the marginal table. The total death-rate was 3.44 per cent. against 4.05 in 1893. The decrease is attributed to greater precaution hav- ing been observed in the antiseptic me- thod of treatment. Of the 15 stone cases, including 2 remaining from the previous year, 1 died; of a total of 52 amputations 4; 13 amputations of the arm and forearm were performed without a death; 9 of the thigh with 1 death; 2 amputations at the shoulder- joint with no death. There were in all 9 cases of ovariotomy: all were suc- cessful, and the result is highly satisfac- tory. 27. The Presidency General Hospital shows 113 major operations against 111 in 1893. The death-rate was high, being 14.04 per cent. against 6.25. This is ascribed by the Superintendent to the severe nature of the diseases for which operations were performed. Two died owing to erysipelas having set in after operation. 28. The Campbell Hospital shows a reduction of 33, the figures being 408 against 441. The decrease took place in the out-door department. There were 30 extractions of the lens, including two remaining from the previous year, of which 18 were successful, or 60 per cent. This small percentage of success is probably due, as has been said last year, to the poor physique of many of the patients on admission. Seventy-eight operations were performed for the removal of enlarged glands, 71 for the radical cure of hydrocele, 87 for the opening of abscesses, and 25 were abdominal tapping. There were 29 amputations against 21 in 1893. The death-rate amongst these operations was 16.66 per cent. against 14.28 in the previous year. The total death-rate was 2.85 per cent. against 2.39 per cent. in 1893. This increase is accounted for by a larger number of severe injury cases having been admitted during the year. Barring the amputations, there were very few surgical operations of a really important nature. Tracheotomy, lithotrity and perineal section were represented by one case each. There was one herniotomy, two cases of excision of bones, and seven of removal of tumours. It was pointed out last year that no great improvement in the surgical work of this institution could be hoped for until it was provided with a proper surgical ward. The construction of a separate surgical ward sanctioned for the hospital was completed in the begin- ning of the current year. It is to be hoped that the institution, which is the chief vernacular medical school in the province, will show better results in future. 29. The Mayo Hospital had 628 major operations, showing an increase of 90 over the figures of the previous year. The excess is chiefly seen in the
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 number of eye cases and radical cure of hydrocele. The more important operations include 61 cases of extraction of lens, 7 of litholapaxy, 2 of hernioto- mies, 5 amputations, and 19 scrotal tumours. Radical cure of hydrocele is represented by 316 cases. The mortality after all operations was 3.09 per cent. (20 deaths) against 1.27 (7 deaths) in 1893. The Superintendent explains the increase in the death-rate to be due to tetanus and liver abscess. After ampu- tation the death-rate was 14.28 per cent. for all cases. There was one death after operation of the thigh, and one death followed the operation at the shoulder-joint. There were six deaths after the opening of abscesses; 70.96 per cent. of the cataract cases were successfully operated on. 30. The Chandney Hospital shows 18 major operations without a death. The operations were of a trivial character. 31. The Park Street, Sukea22 REPORT ON THE 1893. 1894. Europeans 30.36 28.15 Natives 23.64 27.09 Other classes 7.71 3.73 Total 61.71 58.97 1893. 1894.

The figures in the margin represent the daily average sick treated. They show a fall in the year under review, which is attributed to the popularity of the out-door department. The actual number of deaths and death-rate per cent. in the different classes of patients were as shown in the margin. The Obstetric Physician has furnished the cause of death of every case, and it is not necessary to mention them here. A large number of patients are admitted in a deplorable condition, and a large proportion of these die and increase the death- rate of the hospital. Of the 17 deaths among Euro- pean women, 2 were mori- bunds. Fourteen of the 46 deaths among natives and 1 of the 5 casualties among CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 There was a decrease both in the number of cases and in the mortality during the year under review. Some of the patients were admitted in a hope- lessly bad condition. It has been truly said that every such case is a source of great danger to others and deserves the anxious care and attention of the medical officers of the institution. Cleanliness and strict regard for the sani- tary surroundings of the patients are the points which demand special attention of all persons concerned in their treatment. The construction of a segregating shed for such cases which was sanctioned during the year has been lately com- pleted. It will meet a real want. 1893. 1894.

Of the total expenditure of Rs. 6,600-14, Government paid Rs. 5,724-14, or 86.72 per cent. in 1894. 46. Nursing.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 the Campbell Hospital, the cost to Government rose by nearly 6 per cent. This was chiefly due to a larger expenditure on public works. The decrease at the Dufferin Hospital is more apparent than real. Government grants Rs. 1,200 annually on account of European medicines, and little more than half of this sum was drawn in 1894, and the balance in the beginning of the current year, so that the accounts of 1895 will show a large increase. 52. In last year26 REPORT ON THE highest, but the explanation is an easy one. The total cost was Rs. 4,598, and this was divided by a small daily average of 25, which gave Rs. 183-14-8 as the cost per patient. The principle of calculation followed in this report cannot pretend to be the correct or the fairest one, and, if so, the resultant figures are not the surest basis of comparison. Each hospital has its own staff of medical officers according to its requirements, and any fixed rule is liable to leave a margin for some differences such as are noticeable in the figures given above. For instance, at Howrah the total cost was Rs. 5,810. The daily average number of patients treated was 58.53 in and 86.44 out. Reducing the out- patients to in-patients the total daily average comes to 67. The Police Hospital treated 88 in and no out patients. The total cost was Rs. 6,469, or Rs. 659 more than at Howrah, but the cost per capita at the former was less by a little over Rs. 13 than at the latter, and yet it would be unreasonable to say that the Police Hospital is more economically managed than the other. Uniformity of cost can hardly be expected, but any abnormal variations in the cost of the different hospitals certainly point to the absence of economy where they occur. Total cost. Rate per capita.

According to the basis of calculation adopted by my predecessor the rates stand as shown in the margin. At the Campbell Hos- pital the rate represents the cost for small-pox patients for whom no allow- ance is fixed. The calculation gives some uniformity, as at the Medical College and Howrah General Hospitals the rates were the same. At the Presidency General Hospital there was no increase as compared with 1893. 59. Medical College Hospital.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 29 The increase in the cost of English and bazar medicines is attributed by the Superintendent to the larger number of out-patients treated in the year under report. The construction of a new surgical ward and repairs to certain wards account for the increase in the Public Works charges. The excess in the cost of the miscellaneous items is attributed to the purchase of new clothing for the general as well as for the small-pox wards, supply of three racks, &c. The cost of clothing alone rose from Rs. 2,695-5-3 to Rs. 4,921-7-4. The Superinten- dent reports a drying room for clothing is much wanted. Surgeon-Colonel Harvey appealed to philanthropic people to extend their support to this hospital, which is affording medical relief to such a large number of miserable classes. The hospital has recently treated a very large number of patients attacked with small-pox during the epidemic which is passing through the town. It is the only resort of such cases, and the work done by it commends itself to charity, and it is hoped that European and Native gentlemen will respond to the appeal made. 63. Police Hospital.30 REPORT ON THE why the Howrah Municipality should not bear a fair share of the cost of the institution. The Superintendent observes that "the least the municipality should pay should be the cost of the entire native department of the hospital." Government has sanctioned a very liberal grant of Rs. 13,366 for the extension of the female ward, for the construction of quarters for nurses and servants, cook-room for European patients, and for other minor structural alterations. These works were not completed up to the end of the year. 67. Surgeon-Colonel R. Harvey inspected seven institutions during the year under review. Having assumed charge of this office from the 23rd March last, I abstain from making any further remarks in this report. 68.

MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 14TH JUNE 1895. RESOLUTION( 2 ) 3. The number of outdoor patients rose from 252,059 to 264,041. Out of this increase of 11,982, the Medical College Hospital accounts for 3,815, probably due to improved accommodation having been provided for out- patients; and the Campbell Hospital for 2 610, which shows that the out- patient department, started in 1892, has met a real want in that part of the town. The large increase of 2,828 at the Park Street Dispensary is not explained in the report. The Dufferin Victoria Hospital, the statistics of which were included for the first time in last year's report, shows an increase of out- patient from 8,758 to 9,035, which denotes satisfactory progress. The outdoor department recently opened at the Presidency General Hospital had an attend- ance of 303, which is less than might have been expected, considering that persons living in Bhawanipur, Hastings and Alipore have hitherto been obliged to seek treatment at the Medical College Hospital. But the number may have been kept down by the operation of the rule restricting gratuitous advice and medicine, in the case of European and Eurasian patients, to persons whose circumstances render them unable to pay. This attempt to check the abuse of the out-patient system by well-to-do persons is said to have worked well in the Presidency General and the Campbell Hospitals, while it had no practical effect at the Mayo Hospital, where very few European and Eurasian patients are treated. In the Medical College Hospital a difficulty was felt in applying the rule, owing to the reluctance of the medical officers to question sick people about their incomes. 4. The total number of indoor patients admitted into the hospitals fell from 26,058 to 24,912, the daily average attendance also declining from 1,338.38 to 1,281.36. The falling off was insignificant everywhere except in the Campbell Hospital, where the number dropped from 9,384 to 8 440( 3 ) 1895. 1894. January 114 4 February 268 20 March 844 44 April 541 96 May 357 82 So far as these figures go, they seem to afford ground for the surmise that the epidemic reached its climax in the high mortality of March 1895, and is now tending to abate. The weekly mortality shows a progressive decline from 233, the number of deaths recorded in the week ending 23rd March, to 34, the number registered in the last week of May. The history of small-pox epidemics in India generally is that the death-rate begins as a rule to decline in April and May, owing to the dry heat of these months being adverse to the spread of the disease, and presenting conditions more favourable to the recovery of those already suffering. This rule was found to hold good for a series of epidemics in Calcutta, except only those of 1832 and 1878; and in more recent years it is fully borne out by the statistics of the epidemic of 1890, and in a less degree by those of 1894. The causes, however, which produce an epidemic of small-pox are so obscure, and the spread of the disease depends so much upon the action of individuals, that all attempts to formulate general conclusions or to forecast the course of events in any particular outbreak must be for the most part conjectural. Sir Charles Elliott can only hope that the present epidemic is now beginning to abate, and that the lessons it has taught will not be lost upon the Corporation of Calcutta, who are bound by law to make adequate and suitable provision for preventing or checking the spread of dangerous diseases, and to enforce the compulsory provisions of the Vaccina- tion Act. 8. The number of admissions to hospitals of persons suffering from cholera was 567 against 431, 709 and 761 in the three previous years; and 323 cases proved fatal, giving a death-rate of 56.9 per cent. The rate of mortality among Europeans and Eurasians was 72.72 (16 deaths out of 22 cases), as compared with 57 14 in the previous year, and among other classes 56.33 against 55.85. Fourteen cases of cholera originated in the Campbell Hospital, of which nine proved fatal, and at the Howrah General Hospital a European sailor took the disease a week after admission, and died of it. In neither case could the cause of the outbreak be traced, though it is suggested that the insufficiency of the supply of filtered water at Sealdah may have led to the use of polluted tank water. In connexion with these cases, Dr. Ross refers to the result of Dr. Haffkine's inoculation against cholera in the Gaya Jail as tending to show that the operation affords at least temporary immunity. 9. The number of cases of dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) Lieutenat-Governor in paragraph 9 of the Resolution on the report for the year 1893, that all leprosy cases in Calcutta will be accommodated in the Leper Asylum, will be realised as soon as the Bill recently passed by the Bengal Council receives the assent of the Viceroy. Out of the 20 cases of enteric fever reported, 17 of the patients were Europeans, of whom six died. The admissions from remittent fever show a little diminution, the figures being 918 against 1,184, but the percentage of deaths was higher than in the previous year. 10. The total number of major operations increased from 3,339 to 3,643, and the minor operations fom 19,001 to 24,988. Out of the increase (304) in major operations, 125 is accounted for by the opening of a special department at the Medical College for the treatment of diseases of the throat, ear and nose. Death ensued in 129 cases, giving a percentage of 3.4, against 3.15 in the previous year. The largest number of operations was performed at the Medical College Hospital, where the death-rate was 3.44 against 4.05. The figures for the Campbell Hospital show a reduction of 33 cases. A separate surgical ward has been opened since the close of the year, and this hospital, which is also the chief vernacular medical school in Bengal, will now carry on its surgical work under more favourable conditions. At the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, 30 major operations were performed, against 12 in 1893, out of which one terminated fatally. 11. In the Eden Hospital, 1,462 women and children were treated, against 1,367 in 1893. Of these, 718 were Europeans, 600 Hindus and Muhammadans, and 144 belonged to other classes. The death-rate among Europeans fell from 8.40 to 5.48 per cent., the rate among Hindus and Muhammadans increased from 8.42 to 10.59, while the percentage among other classes fell from 12.02 to 6.80. The number of confinement cases rose from 573 to 618, of which 23 terminated fatally. The number of cases of septicæmia fell from 31 to 23, but unhappily 14 of these originated within the hospital. The special ward for the treatment of these cases has now been completed, and it is hoped that this will bring about better results. In this hospital, 392 major operations were performed with 26 deaths, against 337 with 31 deaths in 1893. The outdoor department is conducted on alternate days by the Resident Surgeon and by Mrs. Kadambini Ganguli, a former student of the Calcutta Medical College, who volunteered to take charge of the ward. The female students of the Campbell Hospital receive practical training under her direction. The number of patients rose from 3,535 to 3,990, and the ward seems to be gaining in popularity. 12. The increase in the number of indoor patients treated during the year in the Shama Charan Law Eye Infirmary was nominal, while the number of outdoor patients rose from 11,079 to 11,944. As usual, most of the opera- tions were cases of extraction of the lens. Vision was restored in 75.07 per cent., and 8.30 per cent. were relieved. 13. In the Ezra Hospital, where for the most part patients of the Jewish persuasion are treated, 287 in-patients were admitted, of whom 7 died. The number of outdoor patients was less by 264 than in the previous year. Of the total expenditure, Rs. 6,600-14, for the maintenance of the hospital, Rs. 5,724.14, or 86.72 per cent., was borne by Government. 14. The Lieutenant-Governor observes with pleasure that the work done by trained nurses at the Medical College and the General and Eden Hospitals, assisted at the latter institution by pupil nurses and dhais, is well spoken of by the medical officers concerned. Certain District Boards are reported to have sent two pupil midwives to receive their training in the Eden Hospital, and the Lieutenant-Governor hopes that their example will be followed by others. Eighteen pupil nurses and fourteen dhais passed out of the Eden Hospital during the year. The nursing arrangements at the Campbell Hospital are now under consideration with reference to certain proposals made by the Committee appointed to report on the training and position of Civil Hospital Assistants. 15. The invested capital of the hospitals in Calcutta and Howrah increased from Rs. 5,87,000 to Rs. 5,93,300, the increase being at the Medical College and the Howrah General Hospitals. The following statement compares the main heads of receipts and expenditure of all these institutions for the last two years:( 5 ) INCOME. 1893. 1894. Rs. Rs.

On establishment 2,02,427 2,02,595 ( 6 ) explained that no further reduction is possible, as an extra morning meal has been introduced. 18. The Inspector-General's suggestion (paragraph 57) that the Medical Officers of the Presidency Institutions should be permitted to purchase their drugs and instruments from England, seems a practical one, and should be separately submitted for orders. This method has been recently adopted for the supplies required by all dispensaries and hospitals outside Calcutta, and is expected to result in a considerable saving. 19. The new hospital for south Calcutta, which was noticed in paragraph 20 of the Resolution on the report for 1893, could not be commenced during 1894, but plans and estimates amounting to Rs. 90,539 for the buildings have since been sanctioned, and the work will be undertaken as soon as funds are available. 20. Surgeon-Colonel R. Harvey was Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals throughout the year, and the Lieutenant-Governor takes this opportunity of acknowledging his efficient supervision of the hospitals under his control, and of regretting the breakdown of his health. Sir Charles Elliott's thanks are due to Surgeon-Colonel G. C. Ross, who took charge on the 23rd March, for a clear report which was submitted within a fortnight of the date on which it was due.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1895. No. D/55. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL G. C. ROSS, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT. Dated Darjeeling, the 15th June 1896. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on the working of the medical institutions of Calcutta for the year 1895, together with the statistical statements in the appendix. 2. In previous years it was the practice to give here a table showing the number of deaths in the town of Calcutta, Howrah, and the amalgamated area of the Suburbs. This form of the statement has, however, been changed in this report in accordance with the instructions of Government, and the table given below furnishes the statistics for the town of Calcutta, as defined in section 3 of Act II (B.C.) of 1888, and of Howrah for the year under review and for as many previous years since 1885 as figures are available:2 REPORT ON THE cases a large increaseCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 the year, and the Superintendent of the Mayo Hospital regards the excess in that institution as the yearly fluctuation of figures. The Presidency General Hospital had an increase of 93, due to the prevalence of malarial fevers. No fewer than 233 cases are returned under the head of 4 REPORT ON THE Taking in and out patients together, there was an increase of 7,898 men, 50 women, and a falling off of 3,350 children. The number of Europeans fell off by 260. At the Medical College Hospital there were 144 more Europeans treated as in-door-patients, but there was a fall of 305 in the number seeking out-door relief. The Principal states that the variations cannot be explained. This is quite the reverse at the Presidency General Hospital. Here the num- ber of out-door patients increased, but the number of in-door patients shows a decrease, due, as the Superintendent states, to the partial closing of the surgical ward for repairs, which is largely occupied by seamen. The total number of Eurasians rose from 31,955 to 35,087 in 1895, the increase occurring in all the institutions except the Bhawanipur Dispensary. Among Muhammadans there was a fall of 1,499, and among other classes of 1,014. The number of Hindus increased by 4,239. 6. The table showing the mortality is given below:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 7.

PARTICULAR DISEASES.10 REPORT ON THE 152, at the Howrah 122, and at the Medical College Hospital 97. The Presi- dency General, Chandney and Police Hospitals treated 17 cases between them. Five cases only originated in the Campbell Hospital, of which 3 were fatal. The number is much less than in 1894, when there were 14 cases. The Superintendent is unable to assign any cause for the cases which occurred sporadically during the year under report. The Howrah Hospital, which in previous years had cases of this kind, enjoyed immunity in 1895. Remember- ing that cholera was very prevalent in the town, the insanitary condition of which is notorious, the result is satisfactory. I think, however, the people of Howrah may suffer less from cholera when the water-works which have been recently introduced into that town have been in operation. 11. The Government of Bengal placed under Professor Haffkine the services of three commissioned medical officers and two Assistant Surgeons to assist him in his anti-cholera inoculations, the results of which, when published, will be interesting. 1894. 1895.

As usual the Police Hospital showed the lowest death-rate, viz. .54. At the Campbell Hospital the death-rate was less than in the previous year, 18.73 against 22.47. The death-rate among Europeans and Eurasians varied from 1.33 per cent. in the Medical College Hospital to 2.97 in the Presidency General and 4.34 per cent. in the Howrah Hospital. 1888 12,920 1889 12,793 1890 12,326 1891 11,886 1892 13,072 1893 14,483 1894 13,419 1895 13,674 Primary syphilis.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 performed in the Calcutta Medical Institutions during 189520 REPORT ON THE The total number of major operations was 3,775, against 3,643 in 1894, showing an increase of 132. The Campbell Hospital had 112 more than in 1894, which is no doubt a satisfactory advance. The total number of deaths was 124, the death-rate being 3.15, which was less than in 1894, but the same as in 1893. 25. Minor operations numbered 27,475, against 24,988 in 1894. The increase took place chiefly in the Medical College Hospital. At the Eden Hospital a record of all such operations was kept throughout the year 1895, and the return of that year shows 4,803 operations, against 2,747 in 1894. The differ- ences in the other hospitals do not call for notice. 26. Under Government of India, Home Department, letter No. 6 Medl./238, dated the 14th March 1896, the distinction between major and minor operations hitherto observed in the returns has been abolished, and it is ordered that in future the operations should be returned as in the list given in the appendix to the revised nomenclature of diseases. The orders have been communicated to all the Superintendents, and the returns for the current year will be pre- pared accordingly. 1894. 1895.

The Medical College Hospital had 18 major operations less than in 1894, the total number having been 2,117, against 2,135 in the previous year. The death-rate was slightly less, being 3.33, against 3.44 in 1894. The number of some of the more important major operations is specified in the margin. There were 2 deaths among the 15 stone cases in 1895. Of the 26 amputations, including the 3 remaining from the previous years, 1 died. Four amputations of the arm and forearm yielded 1 death; 1 of thigh, 11 of leg, and 1 at the shoulder-joint were performed with- out a death. There were 6 cases of ovariotomy, including 2 remaining from the previous year, with 1 death; 83.33 per cent. of the cases were successful. 28. The Presidency General Hospi- tal had 148 major operations, against 113 in 1894. The death-rate was 6.83 per cent., which was much less than in 1894. The operations in 1895 chiefly consisted of removal of glands 72, radical cure of hydrocele 13, removal of tumours 5, opening of abscesses 15, tapping of abdomen 4. There were 2 amputationsCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 the year under review, the institution might do more in this direction. It has now got a separate surgical ward, and the disadvantage under which it laboured has been removed. Further improvement might reasonably be expected. 30. The Mayo Hospital shows a reduction of 20 major operations, the total being 608, against 628 in 1894. The following are some of the more import- ant ones:22 REPORT ON THE statements, which are given in appendix B.

That among other classes was 4.83 as compared with 4.72 in the previous year. The causes of deaths among the different classes are given in the margin. 40. Septicæmia.24 REPORT ON THE 42. Food is cooked as usual at the Medical College Hospital kitchen. It is a very grave defect, as the patients never get a warm and comfortable meal; a separate kitchen will be provided. There was a good supply of water through- out the year. 43. The out-door department of the hospital afforded an increased amount of relief, the total number of patients having risen from 3,990 to 7,083 in 1895. The daily average attendance was 32.32, against 29.42 in the previous year. Mrs. Kadambini Ganguli and the Resident Surgeon attended the out-door depart- ment on alternate days for the first eight months of the year, after which the connection of the former with the hospital ceased, as the female students of the Campbell Medical School are no longer sent to receive instruction. It is pro- posed to have a separate and improved out-door dispensary for the Eden Hospital, the want of which is at present felt. 1894. 1895.

At the Campbell and the Howrah Hospitals the nurses employed there are unconnected with the Calcutta Hospital Nurses' Institution, and no complaint has been made by the Superintendents of these hospitals as to their work. 47. The Medical College Hospital had the following staff:26 REPORT ON THE 1894. 1895.

This matter will be dealt with in my remarks on this hospital. The proportion of Government contri- bution is shown in the margin. The Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a larger percentage, but this was antici- pated, and referred to in my last year's report. The figures for the other hospitals do not show any great variations. 51. In paragraph 52 of my report for last year, I pointed out the system which was followed in calculating the cost per patient under the different headings of expenditure in the several hospitals during 1894. The same system will be adopted in working out the incidence of cost per capita in 1895, that is, 10 out-patients will be regarded as equivalent to 1 in-patient. I would mention here that in Government letter No. 571 Medical, dated the 13th February 1896, I have been asked, with reference to paragraph 38 of the note by the Surgeon-General with the Government of India on hospitals and dispensaries for 1894, to deal in this report with the relative costliness of Calcutta hospitals. It will be seen, however, that that officer remarked that the dispensaries in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, the Punjab and the Central Provinces are worked much more economically than those in Bengal. His remarks apparently refer to mufassal dispensaries, as there are no institu- tions in those Provinces equal in importance to the large Calcutta hospitals. I will therefore follow the plan of report of last year. INSTITUTIONS. Number daily treated. Pay of superior establish- ment. Rate per capita. RS. RS. A. P.

It will be seen from the foregoing table that the cost per head in the Medical College and Presidency General Hospitals varied within a few rupees. Comparing, again, the cost in these institutions with that of the previous year, the variations will appear to be slight. In respect of the increase in the Presi- dency General Hospital in 1895 it should be stated that a larger amount was paid for compensation allowance owing to low exchange, and that a full complement of Military Assistant Surgeons was employed, which was not the case in 1894. At the Campbell Hospital the cost did not vary much as compared with that of the previous year. The cost per head at the Mayo Institutions shows the same thing. Taking the Mayo Hospital alone, the cost was Rs. 146-8 per head, which is, as pointed out last year, next to that of the Medical College Hospital. It may be observed that the total cost at the former was Rs. 50 less than in 1894, but the average cost rose by nearly Rs. 4. This was due to the smaller average number of patients among whom the cost was divided. The total cost was Rs. 14,650, which is composed of as follows:28 REPORT ON THE the Gaya Hospital include 398 cases of extraction of the lens for cataract and 26 stone operations. At the Mayo Hospital these operations numbered 70 and 6 respectively. It will be seen from the above that a larger amount of very important work is done in the Gaya Hospital at a comparatively less cost. The Mayo Hospital is under the management of a Board of Governors. I do not think that the details of expenditure of this institution have ever been minutely inspected. The contrast drawn above clearly shows that the cost of this hospi- tal demands careful scrutiny, and that economy is no doubt possible. Such a large number of compounders and dressers will in itself prove the existence of superfluity. Government grants a large amount annually towards its support, and it is expected that the cost of the institution should be kept within due bounds. It would be well if the Governors were addressed on the subject. Total cost. Rate per capita. Rs. Rs. A. P.

The cost per head at the Medical College Hospital and Howrah Hospital varied within few rupees. It will be seen, however, that the total expenditure at the latter rose from Rs. 2,676 to Rs. 3,210 in 1895, and the cost per capita also increased. The increase was mainly due to book-Keeping. Some of the menial servants were shown among "other servants" in 1894, but as they properly come under the former group, their pay has been shown accordingly. It should be stated also that in the year under report, extra coolies had to be employed for the compara- tively large number of bad cases. The cost at the Campbell Hospital and Mayo Institutions varied within a few rupees. The figures for the Campbell Hospital show an increase of Rs. 4-1-2 per head in 1895, as compared with those of the previous year, due to the entertainment of an extra establishment for the very large number of small-pox patients. There was some reduction in the cost per patient at the Presidency General Hospital. The cost at the Medical College, Eden, Eye and Ezra Hospitals is separately given in the margin. The figures for the Mayo Hospital and its dependent dispen- saries are also given. The high rate at the Ezra Hospital is noticeable, but the reason is, as explained last year, that the total cost had a small divisor, viz. 14. The cost per head at the Sukea's Street Dispensary was next to that of the Mayo Hospital itself. I pointed out the high cost in my report for last year, and drew the attention of the Superintendent to it. He states that no reduction is pos- sible here. If figures have any value, they clearly indicate that the Sukea's Street Dispensary is not so economically managed in this respect29 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. the following sums:30 REPORT ON THE bazâr medicines, diet, miscellaneous charges, and buildings and repairs. Regarding the increase of Rs. 2,238-10-2 in the cost of European medicines, the Principal states that the figures for 1894, viz. Rs. 9,735-2-5, were roughly calculated by him, but subsequently the statement of cost furnished by the Accountant-General showed that the actual expenditure on medicines and instruments was Rs. 15,503-9-6. Compared with these figures, the cost for 1895, he says, was much less. This is an item of expenditure which demands the attention of the Principal. 60. Chuni Lal Seal's Dispensary.31 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. and to the construction of temporary sheds, latrines, and bath-room in the small- pox ward. Dr. Gibbons states that the very large number of European and Eurasian patients treated in 1895 entailed a heavy expenditure on the hospital. It is pleasing to find from his report that charitable persons sent clothing to the hospital of all descriptions for the use of the small-pox patients. From the balance of the amount which had remained to the credit of the fund named after His Highness the Maharaja of Gwalior and Rao Krishna,of Gwalior, the Superintendent purchased during 1895 a Government Security to the value of Rs. 100, paying Rs. 106-8-6. 63. Police Hospital.32 REPORT ON THE Mysore, which, it is said, was invested during the year. These two sums give a total of Rs. 3,32,935-8. The total amount invested was Rs. 3,34,921-14-5, i.e., the Governors purchased 4 per cent. Port Trust debentures valuing Rs. 3,00,000 at a cost of Rs. 3,30,000, and Government securities to the value of Rs. 4,700 at a cost of Rs. 4,921-14-5. It will be noticed that the total amount expended for investments was more by Rs. 1,986-6-5 than the amount available for the purpose. It would seem clear that this money was taken from the ordinary income of the hospital, and the utilisation was possible because of the large annual grant paid by Government. At the Chandney Hospital there was an increase of Rs. 1,196-13-9 in the total expenditure, which is attributed by the Superintendent to the appoint- ment of a lady-doctor by the Governors, to the purchase of furniture, and to repairs done to the drains of the hospital. The cost of European medicines, viz. Rs. 675-7-6, shown for the first time in the accounts of this hospital, also in some measure explains the increase.

Sanders held the post of the Ophthalmic Surgeon throughout the year. Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Joubert held the office of the Obstetric Physician from 1st January to 10th October, and again from the 13th November to the end of the year, Surgeon- Captain F. J. Drury holding it from 11th October to 12th November. A covered passage was made from the nurses' quarters to the Medical College Hospital. Presidency General Hospital.34 REPORT ON THE cheaper than that of the private firms in England. I will therefore recom- mend no change in the existing system. 70. I would remark that the Calcutta hospitals worked well throughout the year, and the management generally reflects credit on the staff of medical officers attached to them. I especially desire to bring the services of Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel G. Bomford, Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel R. D. Murray, and Surgeon-Major J.B. Gibbons to the notice of Government. Dr. Bomford has managed his onerous and important duties with zeal and discretion, and Dr. Murray deserves great credit for the improvement, economical management, and satisfactory financial condition of the Howrah Hospital, which is now an excellent institution, and also for imparting stimulus to surgery in that hospital. The services of Dr. Gibbons deserve special praise for excellent work done during the severe strain thrown on him by the last small-pox epidemic, the worst known in Calcutta.

The increase of 216 at the Presidency General Hospital is ascribed to the fact that the out-door department worked throughout the year, instead of for nine months only. At the Campbell Hospital an increase of 1,127 is reported, but the accuracy of the statistics is open to question owing to the issue in some cases of duplicate tickets. The numbers at the Mayo and Chandney Hospitals rose by 2,004, at the Chitpur Dispensary by 1,505, at the Bhowanipur Dispensary by 317, and at the Howrah General Hospital by 578. Against this the Park Street Dispensary shows a falling off of 1,819, the Sukea Street Dispensary of 1,112, and the Dufferin Victoria Hospital of 720. 4. The number of in-door patients rose from 24,912 to 26,879. The increase of 1,967 was shared by all the hospitals except the Medical College, where the number fell by 93, and was most marked at the Campbell and Police Hospitals, owing to the admission at the former of a large number of small-pox cases, and in the case of the latter to the unusual prevalence of malarial fever among the police. 5. Including out-door and in-door patients, 178,982 men, 45,764 women, and 68,805 children were treated during the year. The total number of men rose by 7,898, and that of women by 50, while the number of children treated was less by 3,350 than in 1894, the net increase, taking all classes together, being 4,958. Of the whole number treated, Hindus formed 49.3 per cent., Muhammadans 32.1, Eurasians 11.9, and Europeans 2.9. The number of Muhammadans decreased by 1,499; that of Eurasians rose by 3,132 and that of Hindus by 4,239. 6. Excluding the cases treated in the Eye Infirmary, the death-rate for all the institutions rose from 14.0 to 14.3, the highest mortality recorded for 11 years. Depending as this does to a great extent upon the class of patient and the condition in which he is brought to the hospital, the rate varies within wide limits. Thus the death-rate for men ranged from .67 at the Police Hospital, where the bulk of the patients are men in the prime of life, to 22.55 at the Campbell Hospital, which receives all the waifs and strays of Calcutta; and at the Howrah Hospital, where an unusual number of moribund cases, many of them pilgrims, were admitted, it reached 24.11. Similarly in the case of adult women, the Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a rate of .86 and the Campbell Hospital of 32.71. At the Presidency General Hospital the death-rate among female children rose from 3.75 to 10.83, the reason assigned being the emaciated condition of many of the children who were brought for treatment. 7. The epidemic of small-pox, which commenced in December 1894, continued to increase in virulence till March 1895, when the mortality began to diminish. During January, February, and March there were 104, 239 and 260 cases in the Sealdah Small-pox Hospital, which necessitated the erection of temporary sheds to supplement the existing accommodation. The number of Europeans and Eurasians among the patients was unprecedented, being 213 against 32 in 1894, while the number of natives increased from 144 to 552. Altogether, 765 patients were treated at the Sealdah Hospital: of these, 239 were said to have been vaccinated, among whom 27, or 11.29 per cent., died, but of these only 4 had distinct scars. Among 480 cases that were unprotected either by vaccination or inoculation, 244, or 50.83 per cent., died. 8. The number of admissions for cholera rose to 600 against 567 in 1894, 349 cases, or 58.16 per cent., proving fatal, against 323, or 56.96 per cent., in the previous year. The death-rate fell among Europeans and Eurasians from 72.72 to 56.81, and rose among other classes from 56.33 to 58.27. Five cases, of which no explanation could be furnished, originated at the Campbell Hos- pital, of which three were fatal. Although this compares favourably with the 14 unexplained cases of 1894, the fact of cholera showing itself in a hospital on such a scale in two successive years seems primâ facie to indicate that the sanitary arrangements must be defective. Although cholera was extremely prevalent in Howrah during the year, no case occurred in the hospital. It may be hoped that the recent provision of a supply of filtered water for the town of Howrah will materially reduce the mortality from this cause, and it will be interesting to observe the effect of the new water-works on the mortuary statistics for the present year.
(3) 9. The admissions to hospital on account of dysentery increased from 8,383 to 9,206, and the death-rate from 30.17 to 32.17. Sixty per cent. of the cases were treated in the Campbell Hospital, where the rate of mortality under this head reached 42.36, while among native patients at the Howrah Hospital it amounted to 53.94. Both of these hospitals always receive a large number of moribund cases, and at Howrah the majority of these are said to have been pilgrims. Diarrh( 4 ) 15. The invested capital of the Calcutta and Howrah Hospitals shows an increase from Rs. 5,93,300 to Rs. 5,99,400. The Howrah Hospital invested Rs. 4,500, the Campbell Hospital Rs. 100, and the Governors of the Mayo Hospital invested Rs. 3,34,921, which represents the sale and reinvestment of Government securities held by them, but also included a dona- tion of Rs. 1,500 from the Maharani of Mysore and Rs. 1,986 saved from their ordinary income.

The establishment of the General and Campbell Hospitals seems also to be unduly high as compared with that of similar hospitals at Bombay, and the Lieutenant-Governor will be glad to consider any definite proposals for reducing it which the Inspector- General may submit. It is satisfactory to find that the high cost of medicines at the General Hospital, commented on in last year( 6 ) No. 3215Med1.

Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 8th July 1897. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1896. 2. Mortality among the general population.2 REPORT ON THE Cholera was more fatal in Calcutta during 1896 than in the previous year, having caused 3,449 deaths, as against 2,099. Howrah, on the other hand, suffered less, as a result, the Civil Surgeon states, of the introduction of a filtered water-supply in the month of February. 3.

The number of Europeans diminished by 1,100, the decrease being shared by all the institutions, except the Mayo and Howrah General Hospitals, where there was an increase of 14 and 47 respectively. At the Medical College Hospital there was a falling off of 530 Europeans, ascribed by the Prin- cipal to the healthiness of the year and to the admission of fewer seamen; and at the Campbell Hospital the number was smaller by 170, due, as stated by the Superintendent, to the smaller number of small-pox cases treated. Eurasians were fewer than in 1895 by 254, Muhammadans by 6,061, and Hindus by 2,729, while the number treated of other classes was larger by 1,034. The variations noted are not in every case accounted for, but there seems to have been less sickness than usual during the year. 6.

The figures generally do not call for remark, but it may be noted that at the Campbell Hospital the death-rate amongst men, women and boys was lower than in 1895, owing to diminished mortality from small-pox, while the percen- tage of deaths among girls went up from 18.38 in 1895 to 30.52 in 1896, in consequence of numerous deaths from cholera and diarrh6 REPORT ON THE MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL PROPER.

12 REPORT ON THE It is noticeable that while the rate of mortality among Europeans and Eurasians was only 10 per cent., it was 43.82 per cent. among patients of all other classes. This enormous death-rate among natives is due to the fact that a large number of chronic and moribund cases find their way into the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals. 1895. 1896.

As usual, the prevalence of this disease amongst the British troops in the Presidency district is given below:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 15 28. The Presidency General Hospital had 500 operations, the most important of which are detailed below:16 REPORT ON THE 35. The South Suburban Hospital at Bhawanipur shows 479 operations for the five months during which it was open to patients. Seven cataract cases were operated on. The surgical equipment of the hospital had not been completed before the close of the year, but was being ordered from England. 36. The Howrah General Hospital returns 1,232 operations. The number of cataract operations was fewer than in 1895, viz., 16, as compared with 30. The chief operations are noted below:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 The mortality and death-rate amongst in-patients are indicated below:18 REPORT ON THE Application of forceps 54 Version 14 Embryotomy 11 Porro's operation 2 Abdominal section 6 Ditto for ventral hernia 1 Ovariotomy 8 Oophorectomy 1 Removal of fallopian tubes 7 Hysterectomy for fibroid 5 Ditto (abdominal) for cancer 1 Ditto (vaginal) for cancer 1 41. Operations.There were in all 3,478 operations performed on 1,117 patients. The disproportion is explained by the frequent passing of catheters in the same individual; this happened 2,861 times on 500 patients. In a special hospital like the Eden, a routine proceeding of this nature might be omitted from the category of opera- tions with advantage. The marginal table contains a record of some of the important operations performed during the year 1896. In eight cases, ovariotomy was successfully carried out without a death, and the results of abdominal surgery generally were more favourable than those of the previous year. During the absence, on furlough, for seven months of Brigade-Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Joubert, Surgeon-Major A. Leahy officiated as Obstetric Physician, and during the year a special Assistant Surgeon was appointed as House Surgeon of the Hospital, replacing the fifth-year student designated as "Goodeve scholar," whose residence and duties in the Eden Hospital were found to interfere too much with his other duties. The Obstetric Physician brings to notice, and urges strongly, the necessity for separate washing arrangements for the linen of this hospital. 42. Ophthalmic Department, or Shama Churn Law Eye Hospital, is also a section of the Medical College Hospital, near which it stands. The general statistics of the hospital are given in the statements in the appendix. The number of in-patients admitted during 1896 was 477, and of out-patients 13,206, as against 452 and 13,725 in 1895. The diminution in the out- patients, as shown by the figures, is said to have been caused by a neglect to enter attendance in the register on Sundays. The daily average attendance was larger, viz., 161.34 instead of 148.57, and the number of operations was 597, against 470 in 1895. The number of cataract cases treated was larger than in the previous year, numbering in all 347, and the percentage of success following operation was 80.40. 43. The Ezra Hospital, intended for the benefit of the Jewish portion of the community, is another annexe to the Medical College Hospital. The general statistics showing its working will be found in the appendix. The number of in-patients was 205 last year, as against 199 in 1895, and the daily average sick 13.92 as compared with 13.20. The out-door patients numbered 1,611 instead of 1,624, and the daily attendance was 10.1 instead of 8.90. The number of operations was 11, while in 1895 it was 108, and the decrease is explained by a large falling off in the minor operations performed. 44. Nursing and Nursing Staff.The Principal of the Medical College reports that the nursing was fairly good. The establishment consists of one Sister Superintendent, one matron, 13 senior nurses, 17 junior nurses and probationers, and two nurses for the contagious disease and cholera wards. Excluding absentees on leave or sick, and also the Sister and matron, the average number constantly in attendance was 29. 45. At the Eden Hospital there were one sister, one matron, who was changed during the year, three ward nurses, one of whom resigned because of illness, one surgical nurse, who was changed twice, and three dhais. The Obstetric Physician alludes to the difficulties in nursing and teaching of pupils caused by frequent alterations in the permanent staff. The whole question of nursing arrangements is under consideration. The average number of nurses employed in the Presidency General Hospital was 28. The Superintendent reports that though not equal to the English standard, the nursing was fairly efficient, and that it is now improving under the superintendence of the Sisters newly appointed, who have been trained at home. 46. The Superintendents of the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals report favourably on the nursing in those institutions, and Dr. Leahy states that at the South Suburban Hospital the system of employing native female nurses has so far, on the whole, proved satisfactory. 47. During the year 43 pupils were under instruction at the Eden Hospital, viz., 32 Civil and 11 Military. Of the former 13 passed their Examina- tions, 7 of them with credit, and of the latter 5 passed4 with Credit.

The proportion contributed by Government towards the expen- diture of the different institutions is shown in the margin. The Choonee Lal Seal's Dispensary, properly speaking the outdoor ward of the Medical College Hospital, shows a higher percentage. The income from its invested capital fell short of the expenditure by Rs. 859-6-9, which was paid by Government, while only Rs. 147-1 was paid in. 1895. The percentage at Howrah rose from 17.70 to 47.62 in 1896 owing to Government having paid Rs. 15,621 for the improvements in the hospital buildings. The variations in the figures for the other hospitals do not call for any special comment. 53. In the annual reports for the years 1894 and 1895 calculations were given to indicate the cost per patient under the different headings of expenditure at the various Calcutta hospitals, and the instances in which there seemed to have been excessive outlay in particular items were pointed out. In the Mayo Hospital there has been a reduction in the sum paid for European medicines during the year 1896. 1895. 1896. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The details of the expenditure are noted in the margin. The increase shown under the head of menial ser- vants is due to the pay of a cook, a water-carrier and an engine-driver having been entered in the accounts of this institution instead of in those of the Medical College Hospital, as was done in 1895. The cost of diet increased owing to a more liberal use of extras in special cases. The increase in miscellaneous charges is chiefly attributable to the improvement in the lighting of the confinement and opera- tion rooms, to a renewal of the hospital clothing, and to the inclusion in the accounts of this hospital of the cost of coal, which was hitherto debited against the Medical College Hospital proper. There was an increase in the cost of building and repairs, but this is an item of expenditure over which the Principal has no control. 1895. 1896. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The total expenditure under the different heads is shown in the margin. The am- ount expended on account of salaries of Medical Officers was less by Rs. 4,618-6-11 which was due to the fact that during 1896 the per- manent incumbents were absent either on leave or on deputation, which was not the case in 1895, and the officers who acted for them drew less pay and exchange compensation allowance. The increase in the cost of compounders, dressers, &c., was slight; that under the head of salaries of menial servants is accounted for by the grant of an allowance for dearness of food-grains, There were savings under the head of Bazar and European medicines, due to economical management. Diet cost less owing to fewer patients. Miscellaneous charges increased by Rs. 7,478-13.2 owing to purchase of new clothing and furniture. Building charges were less by Rs. 10,379. 1895. 1896. Rs. A.

Of this amount, Rs. 13,672 has already been expended on beds, clothing, anatomical models and other necessaries, while from the same grant, Rs. 28,917 has been assigned for the equipment of the hospital with new surgical instru- ments. 70. For the Campbell Hospital a sum of Rs. 63,564 has been granted to be spent on an extension of the out-door department, which in future will have separate accommodation for the different sexes, and this institution too has been allowed Rs. 5,000 for the erection of a cow-shed. 71. In March 1896 a sum of Rs. 9,401 was spent on the purchase of Lawson Tait pattern beds and clothing for the Presidency General Hospital, and a further sum of Rs. 8,500, as recommended by Surgeon-Colonel Ross, has been sanctioned for the complete renewal of the winter clothing. During last year a special Committee made an exhaustive enquiry into the structural defects of the hospital and elaborated a scheme for its reconstruction, which has been accepted and will be carried out when funds are available. Already the land required for the purpose has been acquired, and provision has been made in the current yearAPPENDIX.

READ( 2 ) 4. The total number of outdoor patients, which is given as 258,794, shows a decrease of 7,878, which is accounted for by the year being less unhealthy than the previous one. At the Presidency General Hospital the numbers fell off by 163, at the Campbell Hospital by 4,537, at the Park Street Dispensary by 892, at the Dufferin Victoria Hospital by 941, and at the Howrah General Hospital by 768. A reduction of 5,745. at the Bhowanipur Dispensary is due to the fact that that institution was closed during the year in consequence of the opening of the new South Suburban Hospital. This decrease was, however, more than compensated for by the number of out- patients treated at the latter institution during the five months of the year it was open. The Mayo Hospital, on the other hand, shows a rise of 1,029; and there was a small increase in the attendance at the Medical College, the Eden, Ezra and Eye Hospitals, and also at the Chandney Hospital. 5. There was a decrease of 1,232 in the total number of indoor patients treated, and the daily average fell from 1,303.63 to 1,238.51. The Campbell, Chandney and Howrah General Hospitals show a slight rise, but at all the other hospitals the numbers declined, the falling off of 780 at the Police Hospital being the most noticeable. A decrease of 224 in indoor patients at the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, as well as the decrease in outdoor patients above mentioned, is attributed to the removal of the hospital to a new locality and to changes in the staff. The popularity of the new South Suburban Hospital is shown by the fact that the daily average of indoor patients treated was 22.32. 6. Altogether 171,480 men, 46,712 women, and 66,249 children were treated as outdoor and indoor patients during the year, as compared with the 178,982 men, 45,764 women, and 68,805 children treated in 1895, showing a total decrease of 9,110. The number of Europeans diminished by 1,100, of Eurasians by 254, of Muhammadans by 6,061 and of Hindus by 2,729. 7. The death-rate for all the hospitals, excluding the Eye hospital, was 14.2 per cent. of the number of patients treated, against 14.3 in the former year. Marked variations, depending on the class of patients admitted, occurred at the several institutions. Thus the death-rate for men was 1.31 at the Police Hospital, 5.39 at the Presidency General Hospital, 20.70 at the Campbell Hospital, and 23.95 at the Howrah General Hospital. At the last-named hospital, however, the rate both for men, women and children was lower than in 1895, while at the Campbell Hospital the death-rate among men, women and boys diminished, owing to fewer small-pox cases, while that among girls rose from 18.38 to 30.52, in consequence of deaths from cholera and diarrh( 3 ) treated for venereal diseases rose from 13,674 to 14,216, the more serious cases also showing an increase. Twenty-two cases of leprosy were treated during the year, 15 of which were dealt with in the Campbell Hospital. There were 23 cases of enteric fever and 1,075 cases of remittent fever, against 22 and 1,072, respectively, in 1895. 11. Surgical operations, in accordance with the orders of the Government of India, are no longer classed as " major " and "minor," but are returned according to the list of operations contained in the Appendix to the Nomen- clature of Diseases, the number of individuals operated on being specified, and the operations being classified as " principal " and " secondary." In accordance with this system, 24,067 operations are shown as having been performed during the year. There were only five secondary operations; but, besides the number of operations stated above, there were 6,340 reported as having been per- formed, but not specified in the returns. The total number of deaths was 160, against 124 which resulted from major operations in 1895; the percentage being .73 on the total number of individuals on whom operations of all kinds were performed. The Mayo and Campbell Hospitals, where the figures were 3,158 and 2,145, respectively, show the largest number of operations. 12. In the Eden Hospital the number of women and children admitted as indoor patients increased from 1,453 to 1,579. Of these, 281 were Europeans, 460 Eurasians, 725 Hindus and Muhammadans, and 179 belonged to other classes. The death-rate for Europeans and Eurasians is given as 6.47, and that for all others as 10.50. The death-rate for native children fell from 34.71 to 25.36, although 13 children were admitted in a moribund condition. The number of confinements rose from 546 to 640, of which 49 resulted in death, as compared with 34 fatal cases in the previous year. There were 22 fatal cases of septic( 4 ) statement shows the main heads of receipts and expenditure of the Calcutta and Howrah hospitals during 1895-96:( 5 ) 18.

REPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1897. No. 4599. FROM SURGEON-COLONEL T. H. HENDLEY, C.I.E., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 23rd July 1898. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1897, together with the usual statements in the Appendix. 2. Mortality among the general population.2 REPORT ON THE there was an epidemic in the early part of the year which spread to Calcutta. This accounts for the high small-pox mortality in Calcutta. The decrease in Howrah of the mortality from cholera is attributed by the Civil Surgeon to the filtered water-supply. 3. Numbers treatedCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 sheds which were erected for 300 patients. There are always a number of incurable or chronic invalids in the hospital, some of whom have been inmates for many years. The building is not well suited to the purpose for which it is put, but new wards are being constructed which will remedy some of the evils which at present exist. The increase in the South Suburban Hospital has already been referred to in a previous paragraph as being due to the grow- ing popularity of that institution. There was greater sickness amongst the members of the Calcutta Police Force during 1897 than in the previous year, the increase being chiefly due to debility and anæmia, which was probably the result of insufficient nourishment owing to the dearness of provi- sions. The increase in the Medical College Hospital proper was confined to natives, who suffered from the effects of the scarcity that prevailed. The small increases in the Eye and Mayo Hospitals do not call for comment. The large falling off in the Presidency General Hospital is noticeable. It is said to be due to the closure for several months for repairs of the central, surgical and female wards, which were much damaged by the earthquake. This may account for a portion of the decrease, but there was also a falling off in 1896. It is well known, however, that the institution has been unpopular for some- time, and that special enquiries have been made regarding it. It is confidently hoped that reforms which have been set on foot and the construction of a new hospital will lead to a very necessary change for the better. The cause of the decrease in indoor patients in the Chandney and Dufferin Victoria Hospitals has already been explained in paragraph 3. I am not satisfied that the explanations given of diminished attendance at some of the other institutions are satisfactory, but as I was not in office during the year under review, and have only recently taken over charge, I prefer to postpone further remarks on the subject until another occasion. The number of cases of "no appreciable diseases" in the Presidency General Hospital was 61, or 32 more than in 1896. The increase was due to a larger number of attendants on patients. 5. The following table shows the numbers of men, women and children treated as in and out-patients at each of the Calcutta hospitals and at the Howrah General Hospital, classified according to race, nationality or religion. The daily average numbers of men, women and children and their percentages are also given:4 REPORT ON THE NAMES OF THE INSTITUTIONS. TOTAL TREATED DURING THE YEAR. CLASS DAILY ATTENDANCE. A. B. C. D. E. Average number. Ratio per cent. of5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Taking in and out-patients together, there was an increase of 6,290 males and 2,269 females, and a decrease of 3,239 children. The number of Europeans treated was greater by 242, the increase occurring among outdoor patients and being chiefly noticeable in the Eye Hospital, which is growing in popularity. The number of European in-patients fell off by 197, the decrease being in all the institutions except the Eye, Campbell and South Suburban Hospitals. The patients in the Campbell Hospital were all small-pox cases, and most of them were received from Howrah during the epidemic there. The number of Eurasians treated shows a decrease of 1,296. Muhammadans were also fewer by 4,338, while Hindus increased by 10,159 and other classes by 553. 6. The total mortality in Calcutta hospitals (including Howrah) is shown in the following table:6 REPORT ON THE 7. The following table shows the deaths among men, women and chil- dren during the year under report, as compared with the two previous years:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 The death-rate among men, women and boys in the Campbell Hospital was higher during 1897 than in the previous year. This was because most of the patients were admitted in an emaciated and anæmic condition. The number of deaths among female children was also greater than in 1896, but the death-rate is less owing to the larger number of admissions. In the Howrah General Hospital there was greater mortality amongst men, women and female children, which is also accounted for by the admission of a larger number of moribund persons, chiefly pilgrims, who were picked up on the roadside and sent to hospital by the police. These poor creatures are so enfeebled by privation and disease that in the majority of cases recovery is impossible. The heavy death-roll of this class of natives is an annual feature of this hospital. There was a considerable increase in mortality among men and women in the South Suburban Hsospital. Here, again, this was due to the admission of a large number of moribund cases, who came to Calcutta, from the famine-stricken districts At the Medical College Hospital proper the mortality amongst men was less, but there was an increase in the death-rate amongst women and children, which, the Principal says, was due not only to the admission of a larger number of moribund cases, but also to the graver nature of the complaints from which many suffered. The differences in other hospitals do not call for special comment. 8. The following table shows the principal diseases and the number and percentages of deaths amongst in-patients.

Rheumatic affections16 REPORT ON THE There were 27 cases of enteric fever in 1897, or 4 more than in 1896. Of the 27, 16 were Europeans, 10 Eurasians, and 1 a native. At the Medical College Hospital 3 Europeans were treated, of whom 1 died and 2 recovered. One European was also treated in the Eden Hospital, and the patient got well. At the Presidency General Hospital 12 Europeans were treated, 1 case ending fatally, and 10 Eurasians amongst whom there were 3 deaths. A post-mortem examination was performed on the European fatal case, which verified the diagnosis. The larger number, however, of cases in this hospital with fewer deaths in 1897 raises the question whether the diagnosis in all cases was correct. The Superintendent, Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel Crombie, attributes this striking difference in the number and results of 1897 to a tendency to include cases of remittent fever in the category of enteric fever. The solitary native was treated in the Campbell Hospital. The patient succumbed, and the result of the autopsy performed on this case supported the diagnosis. 23. The usual table showing the prevalence of this disease amongst the British troops in the Presidency district is given below:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 17 27. Medical College Hospital Proper,including Choonee Lal Seal's Outdoor Dispensary, Dental Dispensary and special department for the treatment of throat and nose diseases, shows 7,858 operations against 6,210 in 1896, the increase chiefly occurring in the number of unimportant operations performed in the outdoor dispensary. There were 62 deaths, or .78 per cent., against .86 in 1896. As usual a list of the more important operations is given below:18 REPORT ON THE 30. The Mayo Hospitalshows 3,284 operations, against 3,158 in 1896CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 19 37. The Howrah General Hospitalhad 1,439 operations, against 1,232 in 1896. The number of cataract operations fell off from 16 to 12 in 1897. The following are some of the more important operations:20 REPORT ON THE patients in the hospital. In the outdoor attendance there is a large falling off, the reason of which has already been given in paragraph 3 as being chiefly due to errors in calculation in 1895 and 1896. The mortality and death-rate among in-patients are shown in the follow- ing table:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 21 Application of forceps 61 Version 19 Ovariotomy 13 Removal of parovarian cyst 2 Removal of uterine appendages and ectopic gestation. 14 Cæsarian section 1 Nephro-lithotomy 1 Letholapaxy 1 Vesico-vaginal fistula 3 Nephrorrhaphy 1 Colotomy and perineal operation for imperforate anus. 6 Ventral hernia 2 Laparotomy 13 Hysterectomy (abdominal) 10 Ditto (vaginal) 1 Craniotomy 6 Decapitation 5 43.Surgical operations.22 REPORT ON THE under the superintendence of the Clewer Sisters, whose devotion to their work is beyond praise. The Superintendent remarks, however, that there has been an increasing tendency on the part of the nurses to limit their work to taking temperatures and the administration of medicines, relegating their other duties of nursing to the menial establishment. The Superintendent has been able to effect an improvement in this respect. The average number of nurses employed during the year was 29. The question of nursing in this hospital has been under the consideration of a Committee, whose conclusions, which have been submitted to Government separately, will be of great help in improving the nursing in the Eden Hospital. In both institutions the accommodation for the nurses is insufficient. 50. The Superintendents of the Howrah and the Campbell Hospitals report in favourable terms on the nursing in those institutions. In the former an additional nurse was appointed. The nursing in the South Suburban Hospital is also well reported on by the Superintendent. 51. During the year under report, Surgeon-Captain Stevens was deputed to military duty and Dr. Kedar Nath Das, the Registrar of the Medical College Hospital, was appointed to deliver lectures to the pupil-nurses in the Eden Hospital. Forty-five pupils were under instruction during 1897, viz., 39 Civil and 6 Military. Of the former 12 passed their examination, 2 with credit. Of the latter, 3 passed. Thirty-four dhaiswere under training; 13 of whom passed, 3 with credit. 52. Finance.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 increase is chiefly in the Campbell Hospital, where a sum of Rs. 4,575 was received from the Honorary Secretary to the Indian Famine Fund, Bengal Branch, for dieting of patients. The income under the head of local funds shows a falling off of Rs. 13,439-1-8. This was chiefly due to smaller receipts from Port Dues Fund owing to fewer admissions of seamen in the Medical College, Presidency General and Howrah General Hospitals. The municipal payments increased by Rs. 995-7-11. The Calcutta Municipality are required to contribute Rs. 5,000 annually towards the maintenance of the South Suburban Hospital. That body paid Rs. 2,916-10-8 in March 1897 as their contribution for seven months, viz., from 1st September to 31st December 1896. The present system of payments at the end of each financial year does not enable the Superintendent to render a correct account of the finance of the institution, which is prepared for the calendar year for this Department. The Governors of this Hospital have therefore addressed the Calcutta Municipality to contribute their share in the beginning of each financial year. Besides the sum of Rs. 35,000 contributed by the Calcutta Municipality to the Campbell Hospital, the former built at their own expense two sheds in the compound of that institution for the accommodation of the sick paupers who came to the town from the famine-stricken districts. The cost of the two sheds is not shown in statement No. V, Part I, as the money was paid by the Municipality direct and not through Government. The amount received as interest on investments was almost the same as in 1896, viz., Rs. 25,973-13-10 against Rs. 26,061-10 in 1896. At the Howrah General Hospital Government securities to the value of Rs. 4,000 were sold for Rs. 3,880 to meet the cost of quadrennial repairs and new bath-rooms constructed in the private wards. Subscriptions from Europeans increased, while the amount received from natives shows a decrease. Miscellaneous receipts were more by Rs. 7,385-8-5. At the Camp- bell Hospital Rs. 7,942-9 9 was received from the Indian Famine Fund, Bengal Branch, for the pauper patients treated in the sheds built by the Calcutta Municipality. Rupees 200 was also received from the Indian Football Association for sending pauper patients to their native homes. 1896. 1897.

The marginal table shows the proportion contributed by Government towards the expenditure of the differ- ent institutions. The Campbell Hos- pital shows a higher percentage than in 1896, due to the enormous increase in the number of in-patients, to the construction of an outdoor dispensary, a cowshed, and two extra sheds for the accommodation of the large num- ber of pauper patients. The percent- age at the Howrah General Hospital fell from 47.62 in 1896 to 14.83 in 189724 REPORT ON THE against Rs. 2,037CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 25 charges for nursing establishment amounted to Rs. 1,702-14-9, of which Rs. 987 was borne by Government and Rs. 715-14-9 by the funds of the Hospital Nurses' Institution. This expenditure is controlled by the Ladies, Committee of that Institution. Under the head of diet there was an increase of Rs. 551-13, which is accounted for by the higher contract rates and by the larger daily average number of European in-patients. The expenditure on miscellaneous items shows an excess of Rs. 2,060-7-10, owing chiefly to the purchase of new clothing. The lighting charges were also more, because a larger number of private rooms were occupied throughout the year. There was a saving of Rs. 1,996 under the head of buildings and repairs. The Principal says the cost of compounders, dressers, bazar and European medicines cannot be separately given for this hospital. 1896. 1897. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The numbers of in-door and out-door patients treated during the last two years in the hospitals of Calcutta and Howrah are compared in the following table:( 3) General Hospital, the numbers dropped from 2,836 to 2,391, a fall said to be due partly to the temporary closure of certain wards of the hospital and partly to the unpopularity of the institution. The Lieutenant-Governor trusts that the reconstruction of the hospital and the other reforms under consider- ation and now almost ripe for introduction will make this institution more popular in future. 6. Including out-door and in-door patients, 177,770 men, 48,981 women and 63,010 children were treated during the year. The total number of men rose by 6,290, and of women by 2,269, while the number of children treated fell by 3,239, the net increase, taking all classes together, being 5,320. The number of Europeans and Hindus treated increased by 242 and 10,159, respectively, while that of Eurasians and Muhammadans diminished by 1,296 and 4,338. 7. Excluding the cases treated in the Eye Infirmary, at which there was one death, due to old age, the death-rate for all the institutions rose from 14.2 to 16.40, the highest mortality recorded for 11 years. This increased death-rate is no doubt correctly attributed to the admission of a large number of persons who came to Calcutta from the famine-stricken districts in a moribund condition. The mortality in the several hospitals varies widely, depending to a great extent upon the class of patients admitted and the condition in which they are brought to the hospital. Thus the death-rate for men ranged from 1.20 at the Police Hospital to 23.07 at the Campbell Hospital, while at the Howrah Hospital, where an unusual number of moribund cases, many of them pilgrims, were admitted, it reached 28.35. Similarly, in the case of adult women, the Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a death-rate of .63 and the Campbell Hospital of 28.63. The death-rate among men and women was higher than last year in the Campbell, Howrah General and South Suburban Hospitals, where many of the patients were brought for treatment in a very emaciated condition. The returns for these very large hospitals have, of course, markedly affected the total statistics. 8. Small-pox was more prevalent during the year, and the number of patients admitted into hospital suffering from the disease rose from 57 to 218. With the exception of one case, which was taken to the Medical College Hospital for educational purposes, the rest( 4 ) the year against 22 in the previous year, and of these, 35 were dealt with in the Campbell Hospital. There were 27 cases of enteric fever and 869 cases of remittent fever against 23 and 1,075 respectively in 1896. The cases recorded as enteric were more numerous than in any year since 1877, and the Superin. tendent of the General Hospital, where 22 of the 27 cases were treated, attributes the increase to a tendency to include cases of remittent fever in the category of enteric fever. Of the 27 cases, 26 were Europeans or Eurasians, and only one was a native. 11. The total number of surgical operations increased from 24,067 to 25,745. Death followed in 178 cases, giving a percentage of .70 against .73 in the previous year. The largest number of operations was performed at the Medical College Hospital, where the death-rate was .78 against .86. The figures for the Presidency General Hospital show a reduction of 27 cases. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice that, in accordance with the remarks recorded by the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, on the occasion of his inspection of the hospital, the objectionable practice of using the operating room for dressing surgical cases has ceased. At the Campbell Hospital the majority of the important operations were performed by the Assistant Surgeon. The Lieutenant-Governor agrees with the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals in thinking that this being a medical school, it is desirable that the Superintendent should perform more surgical operations of importance with his own hands. It is reported that at the Mayo Hospital, where the pupils of a private school attend, the arrangements for teaching them are inadequate. In the absence of any arrangement for the registration of duly qualified medical practitioners in this country, such a defect may have dangerous results, and the Lieutenant-Governor would be glad to receive a further report on the subject, with the views of the Superintendent of the Mayo Hospital. There was a slight increase in the number of operations in the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, viz., from 18 to 31. There were also 1,410 operations in the out-door department of this hospital, but it is reported that details of these operations are not systematically kept. The Inspector-General has doubtless arranged to have these details in future preserved, as without them the figures are useless. The Inspector-General draws attention to the small number of operations performed at this hospital for female diseases, which numbered 15 only during the year under review, and the attention of the Committee will be drawn to the matter. In the Sumbhu Nath Pundit Hospital the number of operations rose from 479 to 2,174. Many of them were of a serious nature. Although there has been some increase in the number of operations at the Howrah General Hospital as compared with the previous year, the Inspector-General is still of opinion that more surgery should be done in this institution. It is reported that the change in the system of recording surgical operations, introduced last year under the orders of the Government of India, is not convenient, since it cannot be ascertained whether medical officers are as active in this important field of work as they ought to be. The Lieutenant- Governor is prepared, if a sufficiently strong case is made out, to recommend a change in the present system on the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals pointing out the difficulties and submitting separate proposals on the subject. 12. The total number of women and children admitted at the Eden Hospital as in-door patients fell from 1,579 to 1,535, of whom 220 were Europeans, 501 Eurasians, 701 Hindus and Muhammadans, while 173 belonged to other classes. The death-rate for Europeans and Eurasians was 4.99 and for the others 10.18, the figures for the previous year being 6.47 and 10.50. The mortality among native children was rather high, being 33.64 against 25.36, and is explained by their being brought in, in a moribund condition. Confinement cases decreased from 640 to 616. Of these only 22 proved fatal against 49 in the previous year. There were 24 cases of septicæmia, of which 11 died. None were contracted within the hospital. There were 1,146 operations performed against 3,478 in the previous year. The decrease is attributed to the exclusion from the returns of repetitions in the passing of catheters in the same individual. Of the 13 cases in which ovariotomy was performed, 11 proved successful. His Honour notes with pleasure the success which has attended this difficult operation, as indeed all the operations in abdominal surgery. Brigade-Surgeon- Lieutenant-Colonel Joubert performed almost all the important operations himself.
( 5 ) 13. The increase in the number of in-door patients treated during the year in the Shama Charan Law Eye Hospital was nominal, while the number of out- door patients rose from 13,206 to 15,941. There was a diminution in the daily average attendance, which was 158.45 against 161.34, but the number of operations rose from 597 to 1,197, of which 327 were extractions of lens for cataract. Vision was restored in 83.24 per cent. of these cases against 80.40 in the previous year. 14. The Lieutenant-Governor observes with pleasure that the work done by trained nurses at the Medical College, Howrah General, Campbell and South Suburban Hospitals is well spoken of by the Medical Officers concerned. The nursing at the Presidency General Hospital is under the superintendence of the Clewer Sisters, whose devotion to their work is spoken of in high terms of praise. The Superintendent has, however, noted a tendency on the part of the nurses to restrict their work to taking temperatures and administering medicines, relegating their other duties to menial servants. Steps have been taken to check this. The whole question of nursing in this hospital has been under the consideration of a Committee, and much needed reforms both here and at the Eden Hospital will, it is hoped, be introduced before long. 15. The invested capital of the Calcutta and Howrah Hospitals shows a decrease from Rs. 5,96,100 to Rs. 5,92,700. Rupees 600 was invested during the year by the Medical College Hospital, and securities to the face value of Rs. 4,000 were sold by the Howrah General Hospital. The following statement compares the main heads of receipts and expenditure for all the hospitals during the year:( 6 ) to Government shows an increase of Rs. 71,881, due to larger expenditure on buildings and repairs, on diet, and on European medicines. Receipts from paying patients show an increase of Rs. 2,274, mainly due to the fact of the Campbell Hospital having received a sum of Rs. 4,575 from the Bengal Branch of the Indian Famine Fund for dieting of patients. Rupees 7,943 were also received from the same fund by the Campbell Hospital for the pauper patients treated in the sheds built by the Calcutta Municipality. There is a reduction of Rs. 13,439 in the receipts from local funds, which is attributed chiefly to smaller receipts from the Hospital Port Dues fund, owing to smaller admissions of seamen in the Medical College, Presidency General and Howrah General Hospitals. There was a slight increase in the receipts from municipal funds and in subscriptions from Europeans, while subscriptions from natives decreased by more than half. The total expenditure rose from Rs. 6,54,444 to Rs. 7,33,041. The amount spent on buildings and repairs increased by Rs. 34,987 owing to quadrennial repaìrs at the Medical College, and the construction of the out- door department and sheds for the accommodation of extra patients at the Campbell Hospital. There was also an increase both under Diet and Miscellaneous charges. The large increase from Rs, 6,706 to Rs. 11,349 in the expenditure on European medicines in the General Hospital was plainly due to imperfect supervision, there having been eleven. Assistant Surgeons in charge of the dis- pensary during the year. The whole management of this hospital has lately been investigated by a Committee whose report is now under consideration. 17. The Inspector-General has expressed doubts as to the propriety of continuing the appointment of a lady doctor for the Chandney Hospital. The small attendance of female patients does not seem to warrant the retention of a lady doctor, and if the Inspector-General will submit proposals for utilising to better advantage the money that is now spent in this way, they will receive the Lieutenant-Governor's consideration. 18. The construction of a new building for the Presidency General Hospital at an estimated cost of Rs. 22,00,000 has at last been sanctioned. It is impossible to provide so large a sum at once; and arrangements have been made to construct the new buildings gradually, the subsidiary buildings which will be of immediate advantage to the existing hospital being taken up first.

Published at the BENGAL SECRETARIAT BOOK DEPÔT, WritersREPORT ON THE CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1898. No. 5225. FROM COLONEL T. H. HENDLEY, C.I.E., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 15th April 1899. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1898, together with the usual statements in the Appendix. 2. Mortality among the general population.2 REPORT ON THE Sanitary Commissioner to examine the houses in which it occurred. I also saw some cases at the Medical College Hospital. The appearance of the disease caused much alarm in the minds of the people who fled from the city in large numbers both before and after Calcutta was officially declared as infected with plague on the 30th April. As the disease has since formed the subject of enquiry by Special Commission, before whom I gave my evidence in Decem- ber 1898, further remarks on the subject do not seem to be necessary in this report. It is perhaps sufficient to say that every precaution was taken to prevent its spread in the town in accordance with the plague rules in force in 1898, and that arrangements for the reception of plague patients were made in the Medical College, Presidency General, Campbell, Mayo, Chandney, Howrah and Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospitals. 4. Referring to the increase in the death-rate in the years 1895, 1896 and 1897 in Calcutta and Howrah, as compared with the previous years, His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor desired, in paragraph 2 of Government Resolution recorded upon my report for last year, that I should closely watch the present course of mortality both in Calcutta and Howrah and promptly communicate to Government any unusual feature that might attract my notice. In accordance with these orders, I scrutinised the periodical mortuary returns of both the towns, and whenever the mortality during any period was found to be greater than that of the corresponding period of the previous year, I called for an explanation from the Medical Officers concerned as to the cause of these variations. The mortality during the year under report in Calcutta and Howrah did not present any unusual feature requiring special reference to Government. 5. The causes of increased mortality in past years in Calcutta are probably of a complex nature, into which it is unnecessary to go here, but the Sanitary Commissioner is of opinion that the higher death-rates in past years of Howrah have been due to some extent to an imperfect water-supply. I doubt much whether this is the only or, indeed, the prime cause, but am not prepared at present to make further suggestions on the subject. Owing to the want of mete- orological and climatic data, which are not at present available, to the non-sub- mission to this office of monthly returns of sick and to the absence of a more scientific and minute classification of diseases, it is difficult to form conclusions on such an important subject. It has been alleged that the enormous increase of population in certain parts of Calcutta must of necessity greatly add to the mor- tality, but this is not alone sufficient, as the following note from the report of the Peabody Trust for London for the year 1898 shows. This Trust provides houses for artizans and the labouring poor of London usually in lofty blocks of build- ings. In 1898 there were 11,367 rooms besides bath-rooms. The mean population during the year was 19,562, showing a density of 714 people to the acre, or nearly twelve times that of London. Yet the birth-rate for the year was 33.1 per 1,000, or 3.6 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate, including deaths of 54 persons removed to hospitals, was 14.7 per 1,000, or 4.0 below the average of London, while the infant mortality was 114.4 in each 1,000 births, or 52.8 below that of London. Overcrowding alone is therefore not the cause of great mortality, because the risks attending it are greatly diminished by careful sanitation which unfortunately is not easily applied in what are known as the bastis in Calcutta. Happily, in 1898 the cholera death-rate was lower in both places than it has been for the 11-year period. Fevers gave less than two-thirds of the mortality of 1897 in Calcutta and fell considerably in Howrah; but under the heading " Other causes" there was a large rise in both towns. This points to some common cause which has not been defined and which clearly indicates that our diagnosis for registration purposes is very crude and inefficient. It is only when the statistics which will hereafter be furnished ward by ward are available, that an answer can be hazarded to the query what this cause was ? I do not think it could have been due to plague to any appreciable extent, either in Howrah or Calcutta, as some persons have suggested. 6. Hitherto the returns of the Medical Board of the town of Calcutta, which furnish very important information regarding the health of the town, have not been furnished to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal. Those returns are now, under the orders of Government, regularly submitted to my office. I examine, them and refer to the President any matter which requires explanation.
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 7. It has also been arranged that the Health Officer's report shall be sent to me for review; but as it is not published until later in the year, the figures cannot be compared with the sickness treated in Calcutta medical insti- tutions as detailed in this report, but must be dealt with in connection with the Health Officer's returns when they appear. In this connection I would add that the report of the Health Officer of the Port of Calcutta, who has now been subordinated to the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, has been already submitted to Government and the following notes are condensed from my analysis of it. 8. Public Health in the Port of Calcutta.4 REPORT ON THE 1,161 in 1898. This deterioration in the health of the Police Force is to a large extent due to the fact that the men stint themselves in the matter of diet to save money, and I have accordingly suggested during my inspection of the hospital that, as in Military lines, their diet should be examined by their own officers. The recruits, moreover, are of a poor stamp in many cases, and last year the work of the Force was unusually arduous. Cinchonidine and sulphuric acid should also be distributed among them during the unhealthy seasons of the year. As regards the increase in the Ezra Hospital the Principal cannot assign any particular reason. At the Presidency General Hospital the increase is attributed to its greater popularity. Various improvements were made in this hospital during the year under report by the Surgeon-Superintendent. The closer supervision exercised by him and by his colleagues, has resulted in a considerable saving of expenditure on medicines. Many other reforms which were suggested by the Committee referred to in last year's report, and supported by myself, are about to be carried out, orders having been received from Government sanctioning them. When these have been effected and the new buildings are completed, the hospital will be placed on a most satisfactory basis and its popularity will be further enhanced. I have also been able to recommend some improvements in the existing hospital, and I would remark here that not unfrequently, in the desire to effect great reforms which cost much money, small changes, which would much improve the comfort of patients and increase their number and which cost little, are neglected. This I find has been the case in many institutions. The number of cases of "no appreciable diseases" in the indoor depart- ment of the Presidency General Hospital was 117, against 61 in the previous year, the increase being due to more mothers having attended on their infant children. I found that casual visits of old patients who came to obtain an opinion after their discharge were not entered in the books. I have directed that in future the entries should be made. 17. The following table shews the number of men, women and children treated as in and out-patients at each of the Calcutta hospitals and at the Howrah General Hospital, and classifies them according to race, nationality or religion. The daily average numbers of men, women and children and their percentages are also given:5 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. NAMES OF THE INSTITUTIONS. TOTAL TREATED DURING THE YEAR. CLASS.

There is always a tendency to include cases of remittent fever in the category of enteric fever. The diagnosis can only be verified by autopsies. There were no deaths among the cases treated at the Howrah General Hospital. Of the 2 natives, 1 was treated in the Medical College Hospital, who died, and the post-mortem examination performed on this case supported the diagnosis. The other case was treated in the Ezra Hospital. The patient recovered. 38. The usual table showing the prevalence of this disease amongst the British troops in the Presidency district is given below:18 REPORT ON THE The consensus of opinion was in favour of the old system, but some of the Medical Officers raised objections and have also suggested certain improvements. My own opinion is even stronger than it was that for administrative purposes the new system is almost useless. The Government has since asked me to submit definite forms embodying my proposals and the suggested improvements in the old system. I am now considering this matter, and will submit a further report on the subject at an early date. The total number of deaths among patients on whom operations were per- formed, including those remaining under treatment from 1897, was 154, or .72 per cent., against 178 and .70, respectively, in 1897. The following important operations were performed during the year under report:19 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. Brought forward 15,485 Other dental operations 597 For trichiasis 213 20 REPORT ON THE respectively. It is hoped that the surgical work of this hospital will show an increase in future. 44. The Campbell Hospital returns 1,539 operations, against 2,198 in 1897. Fifty-four of the decrease of 659 is due to the exclusion from the returns of the operations known as hypodermic injections, and the rest is attributed to plague scare. In my last year's report I remarked that as this is a medical school, it is particularly necessary that the Superintendent should perform more surgical operations of importance with his own hands. Of the 1,539 performed in 1898, none were performed by the Superintendent. It is alleged that as this officer holds several collateral charges, he has no time to devote to surgical work. Major Gibbons has drawn my attention to the terms of his appointment which indicate that he shall exercise general supervision only. He states that as Police Surgeon he has to perform many post mortem examina- tions and to give evidence in Court; that the former duty incapacitates him, to some extent, from performing important surgical operations involving pure aseptic conditions, and that the latter makes it impossible for him to fix his hours, or, indeed, to find time to see either surgical or medical cases regularly, and in a thorough manner. I deeply regret this, while admitting the force of his arguments. There is no doubt that if the Superintendent of the Hospital is to do his duty to the sick poor, and, above all to the very important Medical School which is attached to it, he should be a whole-time officer. Moreover, in this hospital some of the most wonderfully instructive cases of chronic disease perhaps in the world are to be found, affording material for increasing our knowledge of many obscure diseases, yet it is, notwithstanding there are some able Assistant Surgeons, to a great extent thrown away. Here even such a man as Charcot of Paris would have found opportunities of studying much that was new in reference to the nervous system. It is lamentable that such a field should be wasted. There were 10 deaths after operations, the same as in 1897, the percentage of mortality being .63 against .45 in 1897. The number of extractions of the lens for cataract was 25, or 19 less than in 1897. The percentage of cases in which vision was restored was 71.42, against 59.09 in the previous year. As usual, the great majority of the important operations were performed by Assistant Surgeon Zuhiruddin Ahmed. A list of the more important operations is given below:21 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The number of more important operations was 78, against 72 in 1897 and 78 in 1896. All the cases in which extraction of lens was performed were successful. This was no doubt due to careful selection and to the fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Sanders, the Superintendent, is an expert. Last year I remarked that the pupils of a private medical school attend at this hospital, but the arrangements for teaching them were inadequate. In accordance with the remarks of Government in paragraph 11 of the Resolution recorded upon my report for last year, I addressed the Superintendent on the subject. His report was received during the year, but I considered it best to discuss the matter fully in personal communication with him. I will submit to Government a separate report on the subject in connection with medical education in Bengal. 46. The Chandney Hospital shows 1,256 operations, against 2,032 in 1897. The operations were of an unimportant nature. 47. The Chitpur Dispensary had 1,463 operations, or 478 fewer than in 1897. None were important. 48. The Park Street and Sukea's Street Dispensaries had between them 1,251 operations, all of which were unimportant. 49. The Police Hospital returns 142 operations, against 159 in 1897. The operations chiefly consisted of opening of abscesses. Two were paracentesis thoracis and one excision of veins. 50. The Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows 1,631 operations in 1898. The number in 1897 including those the details of which were not furnished was 1,441. During the year under report the Lady Superintendent was asked to keep a complete record of all operations. Details were accordingly furnished by Miss Baümler, M.D., who held charge of the institution for the greater part of the year. Most of the operations were of a trivial nature. A little more than a third represented the application of Playfair's probe to the uterus. Of the more important ones the following may be mentioned:22 REPORT ON THE of extractions of lens was 13, against 12 in the previous year.

The cost of menial establishment shows a saving of Rs. 298-8 attributable to the dis- continuance of the grant of compensation allowance for dearness of provisions. The charges on account of nursing establishment increased by Rs. 141-2-9. The Government share of the expenditure showed an excess of Rs. 705-13-3, while the amount paid by the funds of the Hospital Nurses' Institution was less by Rs. 564-10-6. The Principal cannot explain these variations, as the expenditure is controlled by the Ladies' Committee of that institution. There was a saving under the head of diet and miscellaneous charges. Building charges were more by Rs. 6,371-10-11 owing to quadrennial repairs. The cost of compounders, dressers, bazar and European medicines cannot be given separately for this hospital, as the Principal says no separate account is kept. 1897. 1898. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The decrease in the cost of compounders, dressers, &c., and of menial establishment was due to the fact that while in 1897 extra establishment had to be entertained for the very large accession of patients, it was not repeated in 1898, as there was a large decrease in the number of patients. Owing to the latter cause there was a saving in the cost of diet, bazar medi- cines, and miscellaneous charges. Under the head of European medicines there was an increase of Rs. 568-15-10, but this is more apparent than real, as the cost of some of the medical stores obtained in 1897 was debited to the accounts of 1898. The large increase, viz., Rs. 48,254-11-3, in the cost of building and repairs, was due to the construction of a new block for the female patients, to the purchase of a Thresh's disinfector, and to quadrennial repairs. 1897. 1898.

There was a saving under the head of bazar and European medicines and diet which is said to be due to fewer patients treated. Miscellaneous charges increased by Rs. 341-15-9, owing to the payment of house-rent to the Lady Doctor throughout the year. In last year's report I remarked that the attendance of female patients at this hospital did not justify the entertainment of a Lady Doctor, and I suggested whether this annual expenditure might not be utilised to greater advantage for the more immediate needs of this hospital, or of the other branches of the Mayo Hospital. With reference to these remarks, Government, in its Resolution recorded upon my report, desired me to submit proposals for utilising to better advantage the money that is now spent in this way. I consulted the Superin- tendent in the matter, who replied that the Lady Doctor was doing good work, and that she attended on a large number of female patients at the hospital, which kept her fully occupied. I have already observed, however, that the proportion of women attending the institution is small, but as I have asked for certain reforms to be made, I will not press for the abolition of the post for the present. At the Park Street Dispensary the total cost shows a decrease of Rs. 213-7-9, which occurred under the head of bazar and Europe medicines, indicating economical management. The amount spent on the up-keep of the Chitpur Dispensary showed a decrease of Rs. 2,335-10-3. The larger cost of 1897 was due to repairs done to the dispensary building and to laying water-pipes. At the Sukea's Street Dispensary the total expenditure shows a decrease of Rs. 59-13-3, due to fewer patients treated. 1897. 1898. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 14TH JUNE 1899. RESOLUTION( 2 ) 3. The following table compares the number of patients, indoor and out-door, treated at the Calcutta and Howrah hospitals during the past two years:( 3 ) compares favourably with that given in the large towns in England, though it is probable that, with better arrangements, more women would attend the hospitals. 7. The death-rate for all the hospitals, excluding the Eye Infirmary, was 13.2 per cent. of the number of patients treated against 16.4 in the former year. Marked variations, depending on the class of patients admitted, occurred at the several institutions. Thus the death-rate for men was .86 at the Police Hospital, 21 at the Campbell Hospital, and 22 at the Howrah General Hospital. Similarly, in the case of adult women, the Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a rate of .76, and the Campbell Hospital of 30. There has been a considerable decrease in the death-rate of the Howrah General Hospital, due it is reported to the comparative healthiness of the district in 1898, and to the admission of fewer moribund persons. 8. Small-pox was less prevalent during the year, and the number of patients admitted into hospitals suffering from the disease fell from 218 to 37. With the exception of one case at the Mayo Native Hospital, the rest were treated at the Campbell Hospital. There was only one European admitted to the Campbell Hospital, against 41 in the previous year. Among those attacked, 23 were unprotected, and 11 of them, or 47.82 per cent., died. Of 10 persons who had been vaccinated, one died, but the marks of vaccination were very faint. The total death-rate was 32 against 30 in the previous year. 9. The number of admissions for cholera decreased from 1,200 to 227, and the death-rate from 55 per cent. to 54 per cent. The decrease in admissions is most marked in the Campbell Hospital, where only 89 cases were treated against 535 in the previous year. Among the patients there were 17 Europeans and Eurasians, of whom 10 died, a ratio of 59 per cent. The Lieutenant- Governor notices with satisfaction that no case of cholera originated in any of the institutions during the year. 10. The admissions to hospital on account of dysentery diminished from 8,415 to 5,571, and the death-rate from 34 to 30. While the death-rate among Europeans and Eurasians was only 4 per cent., the rate among other classes was 33. Diarrh( 4 ) operations performed by Lieutenant-Colonels Sanders and Murray, Majors Charles and Evans, and Assistant Surgeons Nripendro Nath Bose, Norendro Nath Bose, Zahiruddin Ahmad, Manmatha Nath Chatterjee, and Satya Saran Mitter, and he concurs with the Inspector-General in acknowledging the good work done by Mr. Woods in the Dental Department. The proposals of the Inspector- General recommending a change in the system of recording surgical operations have been submitted for the orders of the Government of India. 12. In the Eden Hospital the number of women and children admitted as in-door patients decreased from 1,535 to 1,372. Of these, 200 were Europeans, 519 Eurasians, 582 Hindus and Muhammadans. The death-rate for Europeans and Eurasians is given as 5.14, and that for all others as 10.37, against 4.99 and 10.18 of the previous year. The death-rate for native children fell from 33.64 to 25, although 8 children were admitted in a moribund condition. The number of confinement cases fell from 616 to 582, of which 18 were fatal as compared with 22 in the previous year. There were nine fatal cases of septi- cæmia, of which two originated within the hospital. There were 1,104 operations performed, against 1,146 in the previous year. It is satisfactory to note that of the 14 cases in which ovariotomy was performed, 11 proved successful. The operations were all of a grave nature, and their success is creditable to Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Joubert, I.M.S., and Captain C. R. Stevens, I.M.S., who performed them. 13. In the Shama Charan Law Eye Hospital the number of both in-door and out-door patients decreased from 554 and 15,941 to 505 and 11,058 repectively, and the number of operations from 1,197 to 965. Operations for extraction of the lens numbered 322, of which 81.05 per cent. were successful, against 83.24 in the previous year. 14. The Lieutenant-Governor is pleased to notice the favourable report on the nursing staff employed at the hospitals. He awaits the special report on the subject of improving the nursing arrangements in the Calcutta medical institutions, which the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals has promised to submit. At the Eden Hospital 47 pupils were under instruction during the year, of whom 18 passed the examination. There were also 32 dhais under training, of whom 8 passed. 15. The invested capital of the Calcutta and Howrah hospital shows a decrease from Rs. 5,92,700 to Rs. 5,91,700. The Medical College Hospital invested Rs. 1,000, the Mayo Hospital Rs. 500, and the Howrah General Hospital Rs. 2,000, and securities to the value of Rs. 4,500 were sold by the Howrah General Hospital to meet the cost of constructing bath-rooms and quadrennial repairs to the hospital building. The following statement compares the main heads of receipts and expenditure for all the hospitals during the year. INCOME. 1897. 1898. Rs. Rs.

Excluding the opening balance, the total income amounted to Rs. 9,90,680, against Rs. 7,29,502 in the preceding year. The cost to Govern- ment increased by Rs. 2,60,945, due mainly to the construction of new buildings at the Campbell and Presidency General Hospitals. In the former a new block for female patients was constructed at a cost of Rs. 48,000, an admirably roomy and well-ventilated structure, which the Lieutenant-Governor regards as a model for hospital buildings in Calcutta. In the latter Rs. 2,44,000 were expended in building a new male block and in other alterations. Receipts from paying patients show an increase of Rs. 5,630, which is attributed to the admission of a larger number of patients at the Presidency General Hospital. There was a reduction of Rs. 5,026 in the receipts from local funds, due to the admission of fewer seamen into the Medical College, Presidency and Howrah General Hospitals. The income from municipal funds shows an increase of Rs. 4,883 (the result of a different system of accounts), while the miscellaneous receipts show a falling off of Rs. 6,403. The receipts under this latter head were unusually high in the preceding year owing to a donation from the Famine Relief Fund for the treatment of pauper patients. The total expenditure rose from Rs. 7,33,041 to Rs. 9,88,692, the increase being chiefly observable under the heads " Buildings and Repairs," the sum spent on which rose from Rs. 1,63,550 to Rs. 4,27,953, and " European medicines," which absorbed Rs. 66,325, as compared with Rs. 41,152 in the preceding year. The increase under the latter head occurred chiefly at the Medical College Hospital, which was supplied with a large stock of modern surgical instruments and appliances from England. 17. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice that numerous improve- ments have been carried out at the several hospitals. Very large sums are being spent on the reconstruction and improvement of the Presidency General and Medical College Hospitals, which he does not doubt will greatly add to their efficiency and usefulness, but he is pleased to see that smaller matters do not escape the notice of the Inspector-General, and that almost everywhere little changes are being introduced, which do not cost much, and yet which all help to promote the comfort of the patients. His Honour takes this opportunity of expressing his deep regret at the death of Major J. F. Evans, Resident Physician and Pathologist to the Medical College, who succumbed to his devoted labours in the treatment of plague cases at that institution. His death removed from the Indian Medical Service an officer of exceptional promise. 18. Colonel Hendley was Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals throughout the year, and the thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor are due to him for his frequent and careful inspections of the Calcutta hospitals and his valuable suggestions for reforms in their structural and administrative arrangements. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. W. COLLIN, Offg. Secretary to the Govt. of Bengal.

HENDLEY, C.I.E., I.M.S., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, TO THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Darjeeling, the 25th April 1900. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the annual report on the medical institutions of Calcutta for the year 1899, together with the usual statements in the appendix. 2. Mortality among the general population.2 REPORT ON THE the five years' cycle has come round, and that the disease is not "raging epidemically," and has been kept under control and will shortly cease. It was absent in Howrah in 1898, but in the year under report there were 25 deaths from this cause. There were 2,332 deaths from plague in Calcutta, against 164 in 1898. These are included among deaths from other causes, when they were returned or recorded after enquiry as such. 3. Plague prevailed throughout the year 1899, but it is recognized by all but a very few persons, if such really exist, as now raging with great virulence. Under these conditions, and looking to the fact that there is so much uncertainty as to the actual number of cases of plague, it would, it is felt, be unprofitable to note this year on the increased mortality from diseases generally of the two towns during recent years, as desired by Government in paragraph 2 of its resolutions recorded upon my reports of 1897 and 1898. The subject is, however, being carefully studied. A part from plague, there have been no unusual features in the incidence of disease, which required special representation to Government. 4. Public Health in the Port of Calcutta.3 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. growing popularity of the outdoor department, of which the arrangements and accommodation are now excellent; that at the Howrah General Hospital was due, the Superintendent says, to greater personal attention shown by the staff to the patients. At the Eden Hospital there was a decrease of 1,298, which the Principal attributes to the changes in the post of Resident Surgeon, the officer who is in charge of the outdoor department. I am not sure that this is the only cause. The out-patient room is inconvenient. I think, moreover, that other improvements can be made which will lead to a change. The Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a falling off of 485, which is attributed to the introduction of a rule under which Europeans and Eurasians were excluded from medical relief at the hospital.

Taking in and out-patients together, there was an increase of 22,489 males, 4,664 females, and 5,045 children. Last year I remarked on the disparity in the proportion of attendance of females and children at the different hospitals, and I pointed out that it was most marked at the Mayo Native Hospital and some of its affiliated dispensaries. This is also
CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 apparent from the figures for 1899. There has been, however, some improve- ment, though very little, in these hospitals during the year under report. The defects which I pointed out to the Superintendent have been partially remedied. No improvement can be hoped for unless the arrangements for seeing women are satisfactory. This is not so at present in some of its branch institutions. In the present year the foundation-stone of a new building for female out-patients has been laid at the Mayo Native Hospital, which should dis- pose of the difficulty as regards that institution. The proportion of attendance of females fell off at the Howrah General Hospital in 1899, but the Superintendent's report throws no light on the point. I do not consider that the arrangements for seeing women were satisfactory, but a new waiting-room for females and a dressing-room have been provided, which ought to lead to better results. The total number of Europeans was greater by 1,223, the increase occurring both among in and out-patients. It is chiefly noticeable in the Presidency General Hospital, and was due to the causes mentioned above, as well as to the admis- sion of a larger number of seamen. The number of European in-patients at the Howrah General Hospital decreased by 46, owing to the admission of fewer sailors, but the number of out-patients was greater by 412. Many important improvements have been made at the Howrah Hospital which ought to increase its usefulness. The total number of Eurasians treated was 34,330, against 35,019 in 1898, or a decrease of 689.

The rate of mortality among male children was nearly doubled, the figures having been 26.49 per cent., against 13.92 in 1898. The Principal says that many cases were received in the last stage of disease and in a hopeless condition. The striking variation in the death-rate is observed among females at the Mayo Native Hospital, where it rose from 8.13 in 1898 to 21.46 per cent. in 1899. This rise is accounted for by the admission of a larger number of cholera cases, most of whom were pilgrims from Puri on the way to or from the " car " festival, at which there was a great outbreak of that disease. The rate of mortality among female children varies considerably in the different hospitals, but averages are misleading when small numbers are dealt with, as in the Mayo Native and Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospitals. The rise in the death-rate among male children at the Eden Hospital from 20.77 to 37.87 per cent. in 1899 is noticeable. This greater fatality was partly due to the severer nature of their ailments and partly to the admission of many boys in a hopeless condition. The differences in other hospitals do not call for any special comment. 21. The following table shows the principal diseases and the number and percentages of deaths among in-patients. The diseases of both in- and out- patients are shown in statement No. II in the Appendix.

At the Chandney Hospital, 7 out of the 9 cases died, or 77.77 per cent. This was due to the admission of a larger number of cases of pneumonia in the last stage of the disease. Among Europeans and Eurasians the death-rate varied from 7.14 per cent. in the Howrah General Hospital and 11.35 in the Eden Hospital to 18.05 per cent. in the Medical College Hospital Proper, reaching the highest rate (45.16 per cent.) at the Presi- dency General Hospital. The solitary case at the Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital died, giving a death-rate of 100 per cent. Among "all others," the death-rate at the Campbell Hospital was 63.29 per cent., against 55.41 in 1898, but it is explained by the class of cases generally admitted into it. 32.

I have already remarked on this subject in my recent inspection report of the Hospital. The Hospital has now been provided with an opera- tion room, and better results may be expected. 52. The selected list of surgical operations performed by individual medical officers in Calcutta and Howrah during 1899 is given in the following table:22 REPORT ON THE 478 of miscellaneous character. The following table gives the sex, religion, and nationalities of the 2,245 patients:CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 The death-rate among European and Eurasian women and children slightly increased. That among women of all other classes shows a reduction, but the rate of mortality among children rose from 25 per cent. in 1898 to 32.81 per cent. in 1899. This is accounted for by the admission of a larger number of cases in a hopeless condition. Five of the 21 Native children who died were admitted in a moribund state. Europeans and Eurasians.

The usual table showing the proportion of Government contribution towards the expenditure of the different institutions is given in the margin. The Chuni Lal Seal's Dispensary shows a large increase in the percentage. The expendi- ture of this dispensary increased largely during the year under report, owing chiefly to the pay- ment of municipal rates and taxes, at enhanced rates throughout the year. The Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital also shows a large in- crease, because the receipts from the Calcutta Municipality were less than in 1898 for reasons mentioned above. A large reduction is noticeable in the Campbell Hospital. This was due to there having been less public works charges in the year under report. The variations in the percentages at the other hospitals do not call for special comment. 72. Medical College Hospital Proper.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 27 European medicines as compared with 1898. In the latter year, the hospital was equipped with a large stock of modern surgical instruments and appliances, which caused a heavy expenditure. A portion of the decrease is also ascribed to the separation of the cost of medicines in the different institutions. Diet cost Rs. 903-14-11 more than in 1898, owing to a larger daily average number of European patients and to the issue of extras to a larger number of cases requiring such treatment. The average cost of daily diet was As. 7.0 1/2 for Europeans and As. 3-3 3/4 for natives. Miscellaneous charges show an increase of Rs. 2,281-10-8 attributable to the purchase of Lawson Tait beds and to the renewal of unserviceable clothing.

Government has therefore to bear almost the whole of its expenses. The increase under the head of salaries of Medical Officers was due to the post of House Surgeon having been held by a senior Assistant Surgeon for a longer period than in the previous year. There was a saving in the cost of menial establishment owing to no compensation allowance for dearness of provisions having been drawn throughout the year. The cost of bazar and European medicines is for the first time shown separately in the return. There was an increase of Rs. 386-9-1 under the head of diet, which was due to the larger daily average number of patients. Miscellaneous charges show a small increase. The cost of bulidings and repairs was more by Rs. 318-12 owing to petty repairs. 1898. 1899. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The charges for nursing establishment were Rs. 2,067-5-10 more than in 1898. The amount paid by Government increased by Rs. 2,545-4-1, while that borne by the funds of the Hospital Nurses' Institution was less by Rs. 477-14-3. These adjustments are made by the Ladies' Committee of that Institution. The cost of bazar medicines shows a small increase. Although the number of patients Was greater than in 1898, there was a large saving under the head of European medicines, which speaks well of the supervision which is now kept over the expenditure of drugs. Diet cost Rs. 5,441-9-8 more than in 1898, owing to a larger daily average number of patients and to the introduction of a more liberal scale of diet during the latter part of the year. The cost of miscellaneous items shows a decrease of Rs. 3,511-15, as less was spent on hospital equip- ment in the year under report than in the previous year. The increase in the cost of buildings has already been explained. 1898. 1899. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The cost of menial establishment shows an increase of Rs. 16-9-6. There was a saving of Rs. 156-7-6 under the head of bazar medicines. The Superintendent states that the cost fluctuates from year to year. The cost of European medicines shows an increase of Rs. 1,009-1-6, which is attributed to the purchase of new surgical instruments and an X Ray apparatus. The cost of diet shows a decrease of Rs. 148-1-9, which the Superintendent says was due to better supervision. Miscellaneous charges exceeded that of the previous year by Rs. 2,756-9-9, chiefly owing to the grant of a gratuity to the late Resident Surgeon. The cost of buildings and repairs was nearly the same as in 1898, viz., Rs. 93-0-6 against Rs. 91-4-9 in 1898. The total expenditure at the Chandney Hospital was more by Rs. 570-4, the excess being chiefly due to the purchase of new surgical instruments. There was a saving under the head of bazar medicines. The cost of diet was Rs. 516-4-3, against Rs. 494-3-9 in 1898. The excess was caused by the larger number of patients treated in the year under report. There was an increase of Rs. 535-3-3 under the head of European medicines which has been explained before. Miscellaneous charges increased by Rs. 207-8-6 owing to the purchase of new furniture. The total cost at the Park Street Dispensary shows an increase of Rs. 127-5, due to the purchase of new surgical instru- ments. At the Chitpur Dispensary the total cost increased by Rs. 205-8-9, owing chiefly to the enhancement of municipal rates and taxes. The total expenditure at the Sulcea's Street Dispensary was more by Rs. 85-0-6. The increase occurred under the head of European medicines, which was due to the larger number of patients treated. 1898. 1899. Rs. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The details of expenditure are given in the margin. The amount spent on account of salaries of Medical Officers shows a decrease of Rs. 140-5, the present House Surgeon having drawn pay at the reduced rate throughout the year. There was a small saving in the cost of compounders and dressers. The charges for nursing establishment were more by Rs.40, the increase being due to the entertainment of a temporary nurse during the period one of the permanent European nurses was sick. Under the head of menial establishment there was a large saving, viz., Rs. 401-11-1. The Super- intendent says that in 1898 a larger number of extra servants was employed for bad cases. This was not repeated in 1899. The increased expenditure under the heads of bazar and European medicines and diet was due to the larger number of patients treated in 1899. Miscellaneous charges increased because new clothing and furniture were purchased. The servants of the hospital were also provided with livery. There was a saving in the cost of buildings and repairs. 84. The following was the Staff of Medical Officers during the year under report:- 85. Medical College Hospital.-Lieutenant-Colonel G. F. A.

Improvements.32 REPORT ON THE the basement of the central block. The room has been suitably fitted up, and its floor laid with Indian stone. The coach-house and stables used by the sisters were partially rebuilt and thoroughly repaired. For the nurses a tennis court was built, which will give them much pleasure. Platforms for washing crockery, &c., have been built in connection with the various wards. Numerous structural improvements of a minor kind were introduced throughout the Hospital, and articles of equipment were improve and added as far as possible. In the latter half of the year, a steward was appointed. This officer looks after the dieting of the hospital, and is also in charge of the clothing and the servants. A more liberal scale of diet was introduced during the year. The rules for the management of the hospital were revised and reprinted. 87.

Deaths per 1,000 above (+) or below (APPENDIX. 49 Deaths per 1,000 above (+) or below (MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 27TH JUNE 1900. RESOLUTION( 2 ) 2. The numbers of indoor and outdoor patients treated during the last two years in the hospitals of Calcutta and Howrah are compared in the follow- ing table:( 3 ) 6. Excluding the cases treated in the Eye Infirmary, the death-rate for all the institutions rose from 13.18 to 14.60, the highest mortality recorded for ten years, with the exception of 1897, when it was 16.40. This increased death- rate is attributed to the admission of a large number of persons in a moribund condition and also of plague cases. Depending, as it does, to a great extent upon the class of patients and the condition in which they are brought to the hospital, the death-rate varies within wide limits. Thus the rate for men ranged from .66 at the Police Hospital to 23.33 at the Campbell Hospital. Similarly, in the case of adult women, the Dufferin Victoria Hospital shows a death-rate of 1.36 and the Campbell Hospital of 33.52. The death-rate among men was higher than last year in all the hospitals, except the Police and the Howrah General Hospitals. The female death-rate rose most conspicuously in the Mayo Hospital, viz., from 8.13 to 21.46. This abnormal increase is attributed to the admission of a large number of pilgrims who came to Calcutta from Puri suffering from cholera. 7. Small-pox was prevalent during the latter part of the year, and the number of patients admitted into hospital suffering from the disease rose from 37 to 42. Of these persons, 21 were unprotected either by vaccination or inoculation, and 13 of them, or 61.90 per cent., died. Of 19 persons who had been vaccinated, 5, or 26.32 per cent., died, and in all of them the marks of vaccination were faint. There were 14 Europeans and Eurasians admitted to the Campbell Hospital suffering from this disease against one in the previous year, and some of these cases were of a virulent type. The total death-rate was 47.61, against 32.43 in the previous year. 8. The number of admissions to hospital of persons suffering from cholera was 355 against 227 in the previous year, and 227 cases proved fatal, giving a death-rate of 63.94 per cent. against 53.74 in 1898. The increase is most marked in the Campbell Hospital, where the number of cases rose from 89 to 136. Among the patients there were 20 Europeans and Eurasians, of whom 14 died. Three cases originated at the Campbell Hospital, of which two were fatal. 9. The admissions to hospitals on account of dysentery increased from 5,571 to 6,404, but the death-rate decreased from 29.53 to 26.88. The Campbell and Howrah General Hospitals show a high rate of mortality due to the admis-&shy; sion of a large number of moribund cases. While the death-rate among Euro- peans and Eurasians was only 4.93 per cent., the rate among other classes was 29.55. The number of diarrh( 4 ) number of operations performed by Lieutenant-Colonels Sanders and Murray, Major Charles, Captain Bird, and Assistant Surgeons Norendra Nath Bose and Satya Saran Mitter, and also of the good work done by Messrs. Woods and Ranger in the Dental Department. 11. The total number of women and children admitted at the Eden Hospital as indoor patients increased from 1,372 to 1,494, of whom 201 were Europeans, 551 Eurasians, and 640 Hindus and Muhammadans. The death- rate for Europeans and Eurasians was 5.45, and for the others 9.55, the figures for the previous year being 5.14 and 10.37. The mortality among native children was rather high, being 32.81 against 25. Confinement cases increased from 582 to 638. Of these, 31 proved fatal, against 18 in the previous year. There were 19 fatal cases of septicæmia, of which one originated within the hospital. There were 802 operations performed, against 1,104 in 1898. The decrease is attributed to the exclusion of minor operations from the returns, in accordance with the orders of the Government of India. Of the three cases in which ovariotomy was performed, only one proved successful. Lieutenant-Colonel Joubert performed all the important operations himself, with the exception of two interesting cases, which were successfully operated on by Captain Earle. 12. In the Shama Charan Law Hospital the number of outdoor patients rose from 11,058 to 13,103. There was a diminution in the number of opera- tions. Operations for extraction of the lens numbered 257, and vision was restored in 83.95 per cent. of these cases, against 81.05 in the previous year. 13. The Lieutenant-Governor observes with pleasure that the work done by trained nurses at the several hospitals is well spoken of by the Medical Officers concerned. A special report on the subject of improving the nursing arrangements in the Calcutta medical institutions, which the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals has recently submitted, is now under the consideration of Government. At the Eden Hospital 41 pupils were under instruction during the year, of whom 17 passed the examination. There were also 31 dhais under training, of whom 13 passed. 14. The invested capital of the Calcutta and Howrah hospitals is Rs. 5,91,700. The following statement compares the main heads of receipts and expenditure for all the hospitals during the year:(5) 15. The total income, excluding the opening balance, amounted to Rs. 9,97,169, which exceeds that of the previous year by Rs. 6,489. The cost to Government shows an increase of Rs. 6,509, due to larger expenditure on the new block at the Presidency General Hospital. The receipts from paying patients fell off by Rs. 338. There is an increase of Rs. 6,164 in the receipts from local funds, which is attributed chiefly to larger receipts from the Hospital Port Dues Fund at the Presidency General Hospital. There was a slight falling off in the receipts from municipal funds, while subscriptions from Europeans and also from natives show some increase. The rise in the latter is attributed to a donation of Rs. 2,500 made to the Mayo Native Hospital by Babu Benode Lal Mullick during the year under review. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals has drawn the attention of Government to the small amount of subscriptions received from native gentlemen towards the maintenance of the medical institutions in the metropolis, and proposes to make a separate repre- sentation on the subject, which will be awaited. The total expenditure rose from Rs. 10,20,486 to Rs. 10,25,463, the increase being chiefly under the heads "Miscellaneous charges," the sum spent on which rose from Rs. 88,946 to Rs. 1,02,020, and "Buildings and repairs," which absorbed Rs. 4,37,593 as compared with Rs. 4,27,953 in the preceding year. There was a considerable reduction in expenditure on European medicines at the Medical College Hospital, due to the hospital having been equipped with a large stock of instruments and appliances in 1898. The introduction of a more liberal scale of diet at the Presidency General Hospital has caused an increase of Rs. 5,442 in the expenditure on diet in that hospital. 16. The Lieutenant-Governor is glad to notice that numerous improve- ments have been carried out at the several hospitals. His Honour agrees with the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals that full advantage should be taken by the Medical Officers of the valuable clinical opportunities which are afforded to them by the hospitals in this city for literary work on professional subjects, and hopes in the future to see an increase in the number of such papers published by these officers. 17. The office of the Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals was held by Colonel T. H. Hendley throughout the year, and the Lieutenant-Governor takes this opportunity of acknowledging his very efficient supervision of the hospitals under his control. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. N. BAKER, Secretary to the Government of Bengal.

No. 4578. FROM COLONEL T. H. HENDLEY, C.I.E., I.M S, Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, FINANCIAL AND MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS. Dated Calcutta, the 2nd April 1901. SIR, I HAVE the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Medical Institutions of Calcutta for the year 1900, together with the usual statements in the appendix. 2. Mortality among the general population.2 REPORT ON THE causes, which shows that the year 1900 was more unhealthy than its predecessor. The figures for several years past are, it would seem, also so uncertain as to make fair deductions from them very doubtful. It may, perhaps, be asked whether the normal annual rate of increase of population is not now sufficiently known in large Indian cities, as to make it possible to calculate hygienic statistics for such increase for each year after a census, in the same way as is done in the case of London and other great British cities, in accordance with the formula which are adopted by the Registrar-General. The unusual rainfall in September, by water-logging the soil and by polluting the sources of water- supply, rendered people more obnoxious to cholera, bowel disorders, fevers, and chills towards the end of the year. Plague also prevailed with great virulence and claimed a larger number of deaths, viz., 8,354 against 2,332 in 1899. I appendCALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 3 increase of fevers, which are chiefly malarial, has been great in all the Presidency towns since the introduction of a good and sufficient water -supply, but does not say why this is so. The reasons I have advanced may be partial explanations. Absence of equal improvement in drainage may, perhaps, be a still more impor- tant explanation. All conclusions on this and other causes of alleged increase, excluding of course of plague, are, however, discounted by the increase of the population, as shown by the provisional returns of the census of 1901, which show a rise of from 681,560 in 1891 to 843,487 in 1901, or 161,927 or no less than 23.75 per cent. Dr. Cook suggests methods for reducing sickness and mortality from malarial fevers , of which the practical ones are use of such drugs as quinine, and filling up tanks and excavations where anopheles mosquitoes breed, as well as levelling the ground and improving the surface drainage. These measures have been the aim of sanitarians for many years past. Amongst increase of deaths from "Other causes" tuberculosis is mentioned, and the remedy is held to be diminishing overcrowding, condemning unsanitary areas, and building sanitary dwellings,4 REPORT ON THE The analysis of the above reports, which were drawn up in accordance with promises given in previous years, shows that many of the deductions which have been made are of a very conjectural character; that the increase of mortality is not so large as was anticipated; that, on the whole, the remedial measures are well known; and that, when money is available, they will not be difficult to effect. To all that has been written above, I would add the extreme importance of skilled and unremitting inspection and vigilance, without which costly sanitary projects are of very little value. This is not the place to enter in detail into the questions of improvement of the conservancy, drainage, and overcrowding of the combined towns which form the capital of India. Much has been done, but the most casual observer can see that much remains to be done. The necessity for this is, perhaps, most forcibly indicated by the high rate of infant mortality. 3. Public health in the Port of Calcutta.CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 5 General Hospitals, the increase is shared by all the institutions, and is mainly attributable to the greater unhealthiness of the year. The Mayo Hospital and its branches had between them an increase of 13,176, the Campbell Hospital 3,161, the Medical College and Eden Hospitals together, 829; the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, 749; the Presidency General Hospital, 1; and the Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital, 3,190. The absence of plague scare is also mentioned as a reason of the increase at the Park Street dispensary and Chandney Hos- pital, which are branches of the Mayo Hospital, while the Superintendent of the Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital ascribes the increase solely to the popularity of the institution. I visited the hospital during the year, and can personally testify to its growing popularity which has undoubtedly contributed to the results of the year, but I think it must be admitted that the increase in numbers treated in 1900 was also influenced by the general cause, viz., the greater unhealthiness of the year. At the Presidency General Hospital there was an increase of 150 European and Eurasian out-patients, justifying the continuance of this department, but the number of applicants of other classes fell owing to the discouragement of their attendance as they are provided for at the adjacent Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital, and to fewer workmen being employed on the new hospital buildings.

CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 7 17. Taking in- and out-patients together, the number of males increased by 26,620, females by 4,757, and children by 5,369. There has been a small improvement in the proportion of attendance of females in the year under report, it having risen from 19.22 to 19.44 per cent., but is still too low in my opinion. The new building for female out-patients at the Mayo Hospital, which has supplied a great want of that institution, was completed and occupied towards the end of the year under report. It is to be hoped that the attendance of females will show an increase in the current year. In some of its affiliated dispensaries, the arrangements for seeing women are still capable of great improvement. I have again adverted to these defects in my recent inspection reports, and hope that they will be removed by the present Superintendent. The total number of Europeans was 10,062 against 9,256 in 1899, an increase of 806. An. analysis of the figures shows that there was an addition of 88 in- and 814 out-patients in the Medical College Hospital Proper. The latter increase was chiefly due to an error in classification in the Dental Depart- ment, which will be referred to later on. The Eden Hospital shows a decrease of 41 in- and an increase of 243 out-patients, but the Obstetric Physician cannot account for these variations, which are however small. The Park Street Dispensary shows an addition of 120 out-patients, while the Howrah General Hospital had an increase of 4 in and a fall of 296 out-patients, which the Superintendent is unable to explain. The Presidency General Hospital shows a falling off of 52 in-patients, due to the admission of fewer seamen, but there was an excess of 19 in the outdoor department. The Campbell Hospital had 11 more in-patients owing to the admission of a larger number of small-pox cases, but the number of outdoor patients fell off by 140. Eurasians were fewer by 644, the figures being 33,686 against 34,330 in the previous year. The decrease occurred among out-patients. The largest falling off took place in the Medical College Hospital Proper (1,022), chiefly due to an error in classification already noticed. The Campbell Hospital had a fall of 642, the Park Street Dispensary 667, and the Howrah General Hospital 397. The Chandney Hospital, one of the branches of the Mayo Hospital, showed an increase of 1,780, the Superintendent stating that the figures fluctuate from year to year. Muhammadans increased by 15,778, Hindus by 20,352, and other classes by 454. 18.

The death-rate, excluding cholera, was 16.41 against 13.85 in 1899. The increase or decrease in mortality in Calcutta Hospitals depends on the nature of the cases admitted. The rate of mortality at the Chandney Hospital shows a reduction, viz., 2.77 against 11.95 per cent. in 1899, due to the admission of fewer cases of moribund patients. At the Howrah General Hospital, on the other hand, the death- rate among natives was very high, viz., 32.37 per cent. in 1900.

The death- rate among men in the Campbell Hospital, rose from 23.33 to 31.45 per cent. in 1900, the increase being chiefly due to heavy mortality among cases treated for cerebro spinal fever. The large diminution in the death-rate among females in the Mayo Hospital, viz., from 21.46 to 9.22 per cent. in 1900 is accounted for by fewer deaths from fevers. Marked variations are noticeable in the death-rates among male and female children in the different hospitals, but the numbers are generally so small that no valid deductions can be drawn from averages calculated on these figures. It is noticeable, however, that the death-rate among male children in the Medical College Hospital has again risen from 26.49 to 34.48 per cent. in 1900, the Principal stating that a larger number of these were admitted in a hopeless condition. 22.

14 REPORT ON THE 23. Particular diseases15 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The matter has engaged the attention of Government. Further remarks are unnecessary in this report. The Presidency General Hospital, which enjoyed immunity from this disease for some years past, had one case in 1900 after the floods, coincident with the outbreak among the general population. No local cause for the attack could be traced. 26. Two Civil Assistant Surgeons were employed in connection with anti- choleraic inoculations during the year under report. 1899. 1900.

The largest number of cases was admitted into the Campbell Hospital. There were 25 deaths or 3.89 per cent. against 11 and l .52, respectively, in 1899. 35. Plague.18 REPORT ON THE There was a large increase in the number of patients treated for enteric fever, there having been 59 cases against 37 in 1899. Of the 59, 45 were Europeans, 10 Eurasians, and 4 "Other classes." At the Medical College Hospital one European was admitted, who died. There were 4 Eurasians, two of whom died. Thirty-nine Europeans were treated in the Presidency General Hospital, 5 of whom died, and in 2 fatal cases the diagnosis was verified by post-mortem examination. Three Eurasians were treated without a death. The large increase in cases of enteric fever in this hospital, as compared with the previous year, was chiefly due to the arrival in port of the S.S. Fort Salisbury, with the main portion of its crew stricken with this disease. The death-rate (11.90 per cent. against 28 per cent. in 1899) is highly satisfactory. The Superintendent says it would probably have been even less, had not many of those admitted from the S.S. Fort Salisbury walked about during the first ten days before admission. No death occurred among the 20 cases admitted in the private rooms, though many had serious complications. This result speaks volumes for the nursing and care which they received. Five Europeans and three Eurasians were admitted into the Howrah General Hospital against two Europeans in 1899. The Superintendent cannot assign any reason for this increase. The disease, he says, chiefly occurred among young officers of the British India Steam Navigation Company. There was 1 death or 12.5 per cent. against 2 and 100 per cent. in 1899. The numbers treated are so small that no inference can be drawn from them. The solitary death in 1900 occurred among Europeans. The 4 cases of other classes were treated in the Medical College Hospital, 3 of whom died, and in two latter the diagnosis was confirmed by post-mortem examination. 37. The usual table showing the prevalence of the disease amongst the British troops in the Presidency district is given below:19 CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. "principal" operations being 25,946, and of " secondary " operations 77. The total number of deaths among patients in whom operations were perform- ed, including those remaining under treatment from 1899, was 188, or .72 per cent. against 154 and .61, respectively, in 1899.

The more important operations are mentioned below:22 REPORT ON THE Last year I had to remark upon the falling off in the number of operations in this hospital. I am therefore glad to record that this year the number of the more important operations has increased, from 65 in 1899 to 94 in 1900. The percentage of success among the cases in which extraction of lens was performed was 76.11, against 76.92 in 1899. 45. The Chandney Hospital CALCUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. 23 54.

The following table gives the sex, religion, and nationalities of the 2,074 patients:25 CALUTTA MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. The increased death-rate among European and Eurasian children is accounted for by the admission of a large number of cases in a moribund condition. Seven children died within twenty-four hours of their admission. 57. The number of confinements was 673 against 638 in the previous year. Europeans and Eurasians. All others.

Among European and Eura- sian women, there were 3 deaths, or 1.20 per cent., against 1.90 in 1899. The death-rate among women of "all other" classes was 6 per cent. against 6.5 in 1899.

Three abdominal hysterec- tomies (2 by Lieutenant-Colonel Peck and 1 by Lieutenant-Colonel Joubert) were performed without a death. The results of abdominal surgery were generally more favourable than those of the previous year, and reflect great credit on the Surgeons.

Total 1,24,751 14 6 1,41,138 1 5 The details of expenditure are given in the margin. Under the head of salaries of medical officers, there was an increase of Rs. 1,935, which was due to the post of Resident Physi- cian having been held by a separate medical officer for a longer period in the year under report than in the pre- vious year. The cost of the nursing establishment shows an increase of Rs. 1,286-8-0. The amount paid by Government was less by Rs. 5,726-10-3, while that borne by the funds of the Hospital Nurses' Institution shows an increase of Rs. 7,013-2-3. These adjustments are made by the Ladies' Committee of that Institution. There was a saving of Rs. 1,439-13-4 under the head of diet, attributable to a lower contract rate, and to a smaller daily average number of European patients. The average cost of daily diet was for Europeans 0-6-11¼ against 0-7-0½ in 1899; and for natives, 0-3-2¼ against 0-3-3¾ in the previous year. Miscellaneous charges were also less by Rs. 1,953-12-10, as a smaller amount was expended on clothing. The cost of building and repairs went up by Rs. 16,911, owing chiefly to improvements in the operation theatre. The expenditure under the other headings does not call for notice. 1899. 1900. Rs. A.

Native subscriptions show an increase from Rs. 125 to Rs. 225, a native gentleman having paid this amount as a donation in 1900. The amount given by this class of contributors is infinitely small for a city of 157,847 persons. The amount paid by Europeans fell off by Rs. 102-15-3, owing chiefly to the Admission of a smaller number of paying patients. 1899. 1900. RS. A. P. Rs. A. P.

The cost of diet was more by Rs. 930-6-0. The Superin- tendent states that the scale of diet was raised during the year, the former scale having been found insuffi- cient. There was a saving under the head of bazar medicines, as the supply received in 1899 met a portion of the requirements of 1900. Last year new clothing and furniture were purchased whih swelled the miscellaneous charges. This was not repeated in 1900 and there was there- fore a saving of Rs. 1,330-15-10. The cost of buildings and repairs shows a saving of Rs. 2,280-7-6 as compared with that of 1899, in which year the cost of an operating room was included. Rs. 2,000 was set apart for quadren- nial repairs, which sum was invested in Government securities. 83. Municipal Dispensary, Kidderpur32 REPORT ON THE throughout the year.

Owing to the demands of the Military Department, which led to the recall of many medical officers in 1900, the duties which devolved upon those who remained were exceptionally heavy. 98.

HEALTH OF CALCUTTAAPPENDIX. 49 HEALTH OF CALCUTTA50 APPENDIX. HEALTH OF CALCUTTAMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. MEDICAL. DARJEELING, THE 18TH MAY 1901. RESOLUTION( 2 ) Campbell and Howrah Hospitals. The Inspector-General proposes to make a special enquiry in the case of the latter. There are several typographical errors in the tabular statements at pages 10 to 13 of the Report. 5. The number of admissions for small-pox rose from 42 to 240, but the death-rate fell from 47.61 to 42.91. Of the 239 persons admitted into the Campbell Hospital for small-pox, 177, or 74.05 per cent., were unprotected. The attention of the Lieutenant-Governor has already been drawn to the inefficient state of vaccination in the town, which these figures and the statistics previously furnished have brought to light. He has animadverted strongly on the imperfect enforcement of the vaccination laws, and has directed a thorough enquiry to be made into the matter through the Corporation of Calcutta. The number of admissions for cholera rose from 355 to 728, the rate of mortality being 61.12 against 63.94. The mortality was highest in the Howrah General Hospital. There were fifteen cases of cholera among the patients of the Campbell Hospital, ten of which proved fatal. The Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals attributes the outbreak of the disease in this institution in two successive years to the vicinity of the hospital to the municipal refuse depôt and platform. Steps are being taken to abate the nuisance caused by this; but looking to the fact that the platform has been in existence for a long time without causing an outbreak of disease, the Lieutenant-Governor doubts whether the Inspector-General's conclusion is correct. The percentage of deaths from dysentery was exceptionally high in the General Hospital, being 11.11 against 3.03 in the previous year, and is attributed to a larger number of chronic cases. Malarial fever caused 5,456 admissions against 4,376 in the previous year, and it seems from the rise in the rate of mortality from 9.12 to 11.01 that the cases were of severer type. Four hundred and forty-nine cases of plague were admitted during the year, of which 92 recovered and 357 died, giving a death-rate of 79.51 per cent. 6. There was an increase in the number of operations, the figures for the past two years being 26,023 and 25,109 respectively. Of these cases, 188 ended fatally, giving a percentage of .72 against .61 in the previous year. The increase is shared by all the institutions, except the Medical College and the General Hospital, in which latter institution it is accounted for again by the admission of fewer seamen. The Lieutenant-Governor notices with satisfaction the large number of operations performed by Lieutenant-Colonels R. C. Sanders, I.M.S., R. D. Murray, I.M.S., Major R. H. Charles, I.M.S., Captain R. Bird, I.M.S., and Assistant Surgeon Norendra Nath Basu. 7. In the Eden Hospital the number of women and children admitted increased from 1,494 to 1,659. The death-rate for Europeans and Eurasians was 5.30 against 5.45, and for all others 8.96 against 9.55. The mortality among European and Eurasian children was rather high, being 15.87 against 14.10, and the increase is attributed to the admission of a large number of cases in moribund condition. Confinement cases increased from 638 to 673. This institution is steadily, if slowly, growing in popularity, and contrasts favourably in this respect with the Dufferin Victoria Hospital, which seems to make little progress. 8. In the Shama Charan Law Eye Hospital the number of indoor patients rose from 476 to 518, but that of outdoor patients diminished from 13,103 to 12,816. Operations for extraction of lens numbered 290, in 81.37 per cent. of which vision was restored( 3 ) the higher rate charged for private rooms in the General Hospital. The receipts from Local funds also show an increase of Rs. 7,446; while the receipts from Hospital Port Dues Fund fell by Rs. 9,843, owing to the admis- sion of fewer seamen. Subscriptions from Europeans show a slight increase, but those from Natives, the Lieutenant-Governor regrets to observe, fell off by Rs. 2,401. The expenditure fell from Rs. 9,93,230 to Rs. 9,84,631, the decrease being mainly due to smaller expenditure on the new buildings at the Presidency General Hospital. 11. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor are due to Colonel Hendley, who held the office of Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals throughout the year, for his frequent inspection of the Calcutta hospitals and his valuable suggestions in regard to them. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, E. N. BAKER, Secretary to the Government of Bengal. No. 286T.
