No. 291 OFFICE OF SURGEON-GENERAL, INDIAN MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, FORT ST. GEORGE, 21st May 1878. From SURGEON-GENERAL GEORGE SMITH, M.D., Indian Medical Department, Fort Saint George, To THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL Of the Army, Fort Saint George. SIR,4 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE * Vide Report for 1876, page 15, para 22. The mean annual average of treated in Military Lock Hospitals from 1873 to 1877 inclusive is 1599.2. The number under treatment in 1877 amounted to 2,205 or to 605.8 above the average for the quinquennium. In the civil institutions the mean average of treated during the five years amounts to 1341.6, while the admissions for the year under report aggregate 2,042, being an excess over the average of 700.6. The increase in the numbers of treated in Military Lock Hospitals appears to have been due largely to the pressure of the famine, under which numbers of starving women, many of them seriously diseased, flocked into and practised prostitution in several of the large cantonments and towns. The returns for civil institutions are not complete, but so far as the Presidency town is concerned there is sufficient evidence to show that the numbers of prostitutes and consequent prevalence of venereal diseases, were largely increased by the terrible necessities of the famine. In one Native Regiment, quartered at Madras in the neighbourhood of a large relief-camp, the admissions from venereal diseases were so numerous as to attract attention, and the explanation given was that numbers of starving women who had immigrated from the districts were practising prostitution and that many of them were diseased. This fact corroborates what has been stated in previous reports* to the effect that syphilis is as wide-spread among the rural as among the urban population of Southern India, 4.

During the year 13 registered women absconded, removed their names or died, and the daily average number of sick in hospital amounted to 4.38. Of the total admissions into hospital about one in nine was due to non-venereal complaints. The cases of primary syphilis which came under observation were of an aggravated type. Amongst the European troops there was a slight decrease in the number of admissions for primary syphilis but an increase in the admis- sions from gonorrh8 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE syphilis amongst British soldiers in 1876 amounted to 49 in 1877 they rose to 69. As regards invaliding there was an improvement in 1877, only one venereal case having been sent to England whereas two were invalided for secondary syphilis in 1876. 14. Rangoon.LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 9 May 1877 Dr. Rogers, the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital, brought to the notice of the Cantonment Magistrate that the three Policemen employed as detectives were inefficient. Accordingly four intelligent Constables were appointed in their room and the increase in registration is mainly attributable to their activity.. The women were regular in their attendance at the weekly inspections and absentees were, as a rule, sharply punished. The total number of women treated in the Lock Hospitals in 1877 was 503 against 250 in 1876. Of the admissions in 1877 no fewer than 282 were for primary syphilis ; the cases of gonorrh10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE 63 admissions of women to the Lock Hospital. The disease was mild and yielded readily to treatment. The average strength of British troops in Tonghoo during the year was 415 and the admissions from venereal diseases 45. In noting the latter fact the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital states that allowance must be made for the fact that Tonghoo is a frontier station open to infection from all sides. Shans, Karens, natives from Upper Burmah and travellers from the south all pass through the town and frequently import venereal disease. 20.

True or infecting syphilis on the other hand, characterized by indurated chancre and followed by secondary symptoms, is far less generally seen now than formerly, and its constitutional manifestations appear to be more amenable than they once were -to medical treatment. Among registered women hard chancre is very rare, but it is by no means uncommon among the unregis- tered ; in neglected cases it is at times associated with considerable sloughing and ulceration of the affected parts. Syphilis is not the terrible disease it was 50 years ago and this change in all probability is not due to any change in the power of the virus but to the care with which it is early detected and promptly treated before injury to the constitution takes place. Its whole management and treatment as regards the British army have undergone a change for the better, and that these results have been mainly brought about by assiduous medical care, by regimental and cantonment precautions and by the operation of Lock Hospitals I am fully convinced. That syphilis exists in India in its dangerous form has been admitted, and that non-registered prostitutes and native women who may not be prostitutes are frequent subjects of it is an opinion held by all experienced Medical Officers in this Presidency. With these facts before us we must not be surprised if we find. among the evil results of the famine an increased proportion for some years to come of cases of constitutional syphilis. The increase in venereal diseases in general was most marked in Bellary. There the ratio of admissions rose to 465.81 per mille, in other words, nearly every second man suffered from one or other form of venereal disease. The troops at Trichinopoly and Bangalore also suffered severely, the ratio of admissions at the former station being 323.80 and at the latter 253.60 per thousand. At all these stations there was, as already stated, a great influx of famine-stricken women, and the increase of venereal diseases generally and of primary syphilis more particularly was due to their presence. Registration was carried out with unusual activity, and in some stations extra detectives were employed with the result of adding the names of many clandestine prostitutes to the register. The great obstacle to the effectual working of the Lock Hospital system in 1877 was, as in former years, clandestine prostitution, an evil which is rendered all the more formidable from the fact that the British soldier appears to prefer women of this class to those who are borne on the register. No. 73 of 7th February 1878. In G.O., Public Department, No. 11 of the 3rd January 1878, the Government of India proposed certain measures for the prevention of illicit prostitution and for the more efficient working of the system of Lock Hospitals. These propositions embraced the limitation of the area within which preventive measures were to be enforced, the employment of a special Detective Police under European superinten- dence, the imposition of increased penalties on women practising illicit prostitution in cantonments or in the adjoining towns and villages, and the recommendation of a more hearty co-operation of the Civil and Military authorities as regards preven- tive and curative measures. In forwarding the above suggestions the Government of India solicited the views of the Local Government as to the improvement of the Lock Hospital system generally, and as to the apparent necessity of altering the Cantonment Act (No. XXII of 1864) so as to bring it in closer conformity with the Contagious Diseases' Act, No. XIV of 1868. The views of this office on these important points were communicated to Government in the letter marginally noted, and as they are germane to the subject in hand this opportunity may be taken of placing some of them briefly on record. The Cantonment Act of 1864 has for its object the protection of public health, but as worked hitherto, it has been restricted in its operations to prostitutes consorting with European soldiers, a limitation which carries with it an obvious element of failure. With regard to the proposed alteration of this Act so as to bring its terms more in agreement with those of the Contagious Diseases' Act, it was observed that the leading principle of the latter is that no environment shall avail to shield a woman from the liabilities of a life of prostitution. The practical difficulty in the way of suppressing venereal disease in cantonments is clandestine prostitution. To meet this there must be the cordial co-operation of the Military and Civil authorities, and the good results of such co-operation will be the more assured if, in drawing up a new Act provision be made, consistently with the liberty of the subject, for facili-

Valid proof as to habitual or occasional prostitution should set aside all such pleas as those of marriage, concubinage, &c., so often and successfully advanced to set aside the action of the law. The powers of the revised Act should also be clear and comprehensive, with a proviso that they are to be exercised with judgment and discretion. This discretion would be more especially necessary in such cases as those of pagoda and dancing girls. In Madras these women according to the Health Officer are often subjects of syphilitic disease In Calcutta the same classes are said to be comparatively free from disease. In Calcutta they are registered bat not in Madras. The Health Officer remarks that many of these women have no objeotior to registration, provided some separate arrangements were made for their dieting and accommodation when under treatment. This class of prostitutes need not I think be excluded from the operation of the proposed Act. In cantonments clandestine prostitution is carried on to a serious extent by native females employed about barracks and horse lines such as domestic servants, laboring coolies, punkah-pullers, grass-cutters, &c., and the suggestion is deserving of consideration how far it is feasible as regards European barracks to substitute male for female servants. Many of the women of the classes named are clandestine and diseased prostitutes. Their detection, however, is difficult, for soldiers seem to regard it as a point of honor not to disclose illicit prostitutes from whom they have contracted disease, Soldiers infected by women of this stamp not infrequently communicate disease to registered prosti- tutes. The Cantonment Sub-Committee for the Lock Hospital should be a comprehen- sive one and should include, when available, the Civil authority, the two Deputy Surgeons-General, the Officer commanding the European Regiment, the Cantonment Magistrate, the Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent of Police, the President of the Municipal Commission and the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital who should also act as Secretary. It appears inexpedient that the Medical Officer of a Lock Hospital should be invested with any police or magisterial authority. There should be Regimental Detective Police co-operating with Native Police under a European Head Constable. These constables should be relieved of all other duties. The institution of lal-bazaars advocated by many requires further consideration ; but from a point of view with which I sympathize it does not seem necessary to provide ostensibly the means and opportunities whereby vice may find its gratifications, or to associate the prestige of Government with legalized localities where such provision is to be found, It should further be borne in mind that -where registration is effectual there will be a diminution in the prevalence and severity of syphilitic diseases amongst the registered women, with possibly some increase in the numbers of the unregistered. If, however, the provisions of the Act be rigorously carried out, there may result a diminution in the number of registered women, with a corresponding increase of illicit prostitution of a kind difficult to detect, and a corresponding increase in the amount and severity of disease amongst the registered. It will thus be seen how necessary it is that the provisions of a comprehensive Act should be enforced with prudence and discretion. The usual reports of the Medical Officers in charge of Lock Hospitals, with statistical tables illustrating the working of these institutions, are appended.

This great increase is owing to the great influx of famine-stricken native women into Bangalore during the year from all parts of Mysore territory. Many of these women, and some of them extensively diseased, carried on prostitution in all parts of Bangalore, and there can be no doubt that the European soldiers consorted freely with them, and a great many contracted venereal disease from them. 4

To put down this evil the detective agency must be considerably increased, as it can scarcely be expected that four or five policemen can by any possibility keep efficient supervision over an area of 14 square miles. The rules, as they now stand, affect those women who consort, or are suspected to consort, with Europeans, and they only can be taken up by the police, brought before a magistrate, and compelled to register. It is a pity that these rules are not made to extend to all women who carry on indiscriminate prostitution, whether with Europeans or Natives; if this could be done, there can be no doubt that a very great check would be put to the spread of venereal disease.

The hospital building is suitable and satisfactory in every point of sanitation, and therefore remains unaltered. The rules have been under the supervision and control of the Cantonment Committee. The returns of venereal sick of British troops have been regularly received, and the following statement is prepared from them:16 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE A Corporal of the British regiment has been reported to have been specially appointed as Regimental Detective Agent in accompanying soldiers to the bazaar, who point out the women who diseased them; and a Regimental Police party patrols at nightfall, preventing any prosti- tute, cooly woman or other entering the barrack premises after sunset. The increased special party of Police, now consisting of 1 Head Constable and 3 Constables, engaged upon the same duty, have during this famine year had a wider field open to their operations than in any preceding. Registration has thereby been much extended also. Ninety-nine women have been registered in 1877 against 27 only in the year preceding; 47 women were struck off the register in 1877, while in 1876 62 were No fees have been levied for registration. Prostitutes have not been regular in their attendance at the tri-weekly inspections: lists of such absentees from the periodic examinations are submitted weekly, one to the Cantonment Magistrate and one to the Superintendent of Police. The proportion of absentees has been 1 in every 3.59 of the numerical strength, and several have absconded from the station. The number absconded from the hospital has been 6. Venereal diseases alone are admitted. The total number of such admissions during 1877 has been 398 against 273 of the year preceding, as exhibited under their several headings. The number of sick in hospital on the 1st January 1877 was 16; the maximum number of sick attained was 75 on the 20th September. On the 31st December the number was reduced to 27. The marked increase of venereal during the year under review is conclusively suggestive of the famine; concurrent directly and indirectly with the influx of district famine refugees in search of famine-relief, eking out a livelihood by prostitution, and presenting a wider field of infection to the troops and others, doubtless at cheaper rates. The wider field opened to the operations of the increased special detective party of police, and the extended registration occasioned thereby, manifestly indicate this; the last act in its history being the final hospital admission of the diseased prostitute having betrayed herself by disseminating infection among the troops and so brought under report and registration, and then sent to the lock, where she remains under treatment and daily morning and evening examinations, and from whence she is not again discharged until she has been free from venereal disease and danger of infection for at least a week. The hospital returns of the year include several non-registered diseased women who voluntarily came for treatment, as well as such others sent in by medical subordinates attached to Famine-relief Camps and found to be diseased. It appears to me advisable that the system of segregation found to answer so successfully in some other military stations, such as Aden, may be made applicable to this, and that the compulsory residence of the registered prostitute section to an allotted quarter of the town be adopted. The Lock Hospital is situated in an open part of the cantonment amidst two great populous bazaars, conveniently distant from each, and about half a mile south of the fort; there is a very general voluntary disposition among the prostitutes having so frequently to attend it, to reside in its immediate neighborhood, and it appears to me in every respect a suitable locality for them if all were centred in it, so bringing them under better police supervision and control.

Making due allowance for the diminution in the average strength of the European force at Kamptee during the past as compared with the previous year, this statement shews a very considerable decrease in the number of admissions among Europeans for venereal disease. This decrease is observable under all three headings of primary syphilis, secondary syphilis and gonorrh20 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE The dhaie, as already stated, visited the first-class women daily at their houses since the new Lall-bazaar, in which all of these women live, was rebuilt; but she has not reported any cases of venereal disease. In conclusion, I beg to reiterate my suggestion of last year respecting increased vigilance in the supervision of all the lower classes of Native females employed in and about the European barracks, and I would further suggest, that so far as this may be found practicable, male punkah- pullers and coolies should be employed in the place of women. Extract from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, St, Thomas' Mount, by Surgeon-Major HAMILTON ROSS, M.D. Ninety-eight cases of venereal disease were admitted into the European hospital during the year according to the weekly returns, which have been regularly received during the year. Of these 98 cases 79 are stated to have been contracted at the Mount, 5 at Rangoon, 3 at Madras, 2 at Bangalore, 1 at Poonamallee, and 1 at Bellary; 6 cases where contracted not ascer- tained. There is no Cantonment Sub-Committee. Measures for the control of prostitution, and specially for the prevention of unlicensed prostitution within the cantonment, rest with the Police authorities, the Superintendent being the Registrar, to whom a report is sent weekly, immediately after the periodical examination, of all the registered prostitutes who were present or absent at that period. Thirty-two prostitutes are registered at the Mount, 16 at Poonamallee, and 11 at Palaveram. Of course the 32 who are registered at the Mount are held responsible for having diseased 79 men at the Mount, but as I believe private prostitution is carried on to an almost unlimited extent by grass-cutters, camp followers' wives and others, I by no means hold the registered, prostitutes responsible for more than a fractional part of the disease which has obtained amongst the men of the Royal Artillery stationed at the Mount during the year. Besides women come from other stations and carry on prostitution for a few days, and then disappear without the public getting to know anything of them whatever. I am unable to account for the increased number of cases of venereal disease amongst the men of the Artillery this year; it may be from the men being more intemperate, and in consequence less under control, or from laxness on the part of the Police in detecting women who are carrying on prostitution in a private manner, or from both combined, or it may be that the men brought the disease with them and spread conta- gion amongst the women of the station, for at the end of last year the women of the station were singularly clean. There can be no doubt but the Police have a difficult duty to perform regarding prostitution, but I believe the duty is badly performed. The increase of venereal at the Mount has been frequently brought to the notice of the Police. The women do not attend for inspection as regularly as they should be made to do. All the registered women are required to attend at the Lock Hospital every Friday. The average daily sick of the year now under review has been 6.76. The establishment has no doubt done much to control both the amount and the virulence of the venereal disease as it obtains, both among the male and female patients. No women are admitted because of their monthly visitation, but sometimes other diseases supervene upon the specific ailment. I am not prepared to make any suggestions as to change in the rules; they appear to me good. Private prostitution and want of vigilance on the part of the Police are the great diffi- culties. I have great doubts still as to the capacity of the present Head Constable and his men for the duty; it appears to me that they may or may not perform their duties as it suits their own convenience. I have no authority with them, and can only treat the people brought by the Police to the Lock Hospital suffering from disease. No deaths occurred in the hospital.

By this arrangement the building is now capable of accommodating 38 patients. On the days on which the weekly examinations are held, one of these rooms is temporarily made use of for the purpose. The following table compares the extent to which venereal disease was prevalent during the past three years in the British troops:22 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE This statement shows a marked variation in the percentage of admissions to strength in regi- ments and batteries. On this point the Medical Officer in charge of Royal Artillery states:23 LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. In each of the months from August to December inclusive of the past year, more than 20 unregistered prostitutes have been detected and brought on the register, and in almost every case these unregistered prostitutes were found diseased. It is therefore not a matter of surprise that so much disease should exist amongst the European troops, but rather that it is not more, when it has only to be borne in mind that to create the amount of disease that has existed amongst the European troops during the past year, it is only necessary for any twenty of these unregistered and diseased prostitutes to infect two men each per month. There is no Canton- ment Sub-Committee. The Medical Officer, in conjunction with the Cantonment Magistrate, generally supervises the working of the institution, and when any matter of an important nature arises, it is laid before the Cantonment Committee, which meets once a month. Up to May 1877 three Police Constables were employed as detectives for apprehending and sending for registration and examination such women as were suspected of associating with Europeans. As I found these men slack in their work, they were removed at my request, The Cantonment Magistrate was kind enough to supply me with 4 other intelligent men, thus augmenting the number by one additional detective. Since the entry of these men on their work, the number of newly registered prostitutes has increased by 139 within the last 7 months, whereas during the preceding 5 months the number was 14. During the year 1877, 153 prostitutes were brought on the register, bringing the total number of registered prostitutes on 31st December 1877 to 230 against 121 at the corresponding date of 1876. Of the 153 newly registered prostitutes only 14 were found free from disease. The detection of these unregistered prostitutes, and bringing them under the operation of the Act, is mainly owing to the greater efficiency of the police now attached to the Lock Hospital. It was more than suspected that the old hands were in collusion with the unregistered prostitutes, and were in the habit of receiving bribes. They were accordingly discharged in May, and the result of the employment of the new men is shown in the preceding table; but although this feature in the working of the Lock Hospital is satisfactory, it has produced no beneficial result as regards the health of the European troops. On the contrary, although the average total strength of the troops during 1877 as compared with 1876 shows a decrease of 364, there have been 25 more admissions into hospital for venereal disease. No fees are levied for registration of prosti- tutes; as a rule, the women are regular in their attendance at the weekly examinations conducted on Tuesdays at Secunderabad and Thursdays at Trimulgherry. The number of women who individually absented themselves was 70 as compared with 69 in 1876. The average number of prostitutes attending the periodical examination was 133.68 as compared with 103.34 in 1876. The maximum monthly average was 206.51 and the minimum 100.8. In the previous year the figures were 114.2 and 98.1 respectively. Of the 70 prostitutes who absented themselves at them weekly examinations 21 were sentenced to hard labor, 16 simple imprisonment, 2 fined, 31 either left the station, or had their names removed from the register. During the year 44 absconded, died, or had their names removed from the register, being 2 less than the previous year. The form of disease amongst the registered women readily yielded to treatment within a very short period, while amongst those newly registered it was very severe, so much so, that they had to be detained in hospital for long periods to effect a complete cure. The extent to which voluntary applications have been made for treatment by diseased women will be seen from the statement given below:24 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Of the total number 3 were brought on the register with their consent, 8 left the station or joined their families, 2 were under treatment at the close of the year, and I died. The subjoined table illustrates the extent to which primary syphilis and gonorrh25 LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. The only European troops at the station consist of a detachment of H. M.'s 33rd Regiment. The average strength of it during the year has been 47.06. The number of admissions for venereal diseases during the same period has been as follows:26 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE double the amount of that for last year. The advantages of registration and weekly inspections were clearly shewn in the condition of those admitted from the relief camps and those from the list of public prostitutes. In the latter, the cases were slight and readily amenable to treat- ment, whilst in the former the disease had progressed to a frightful extent. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations has been more regular. As regards the 4 fatal cases, 2 were from cholera, 1 from cerebral disease, and 1 from diabetes and extensive syphilitic disease. In comparison with former years there has been a great improvement in the registration of prostitutes, and with reference to the class admitted, there is still doubtless room for further amendment. Some of them appear in a thoroughly broken-down state of health, the result of repeated attacks of syphilis, combined with the effects of the treatment undergone in their native villages.

Such women also who absent themselves from the periodical examinations, or who abscond from hospital, when arrested and brought before the magistrate are punished. The estimated population of the town and suburbs of Rangoon, according to the census of 1870, is 91,579, of which number 34,595 are females. The registration practically extends to all classes residing within municipal limits, which extends over an area of twelve square miles. The total number of women registered as compared with the average of the last five years is29 LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. Extract from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Thayetmyo, by Surgeon OSWALD BAKER. The daily average strength of the European garrison for the past year, as nearly as it can be calculated from the returns received, was of Infantry 407 and Artillery 152, or a total average force of 559 men. Amongst this force there were 64 cases of venereal disease, being 11.4 per cent. of average strength; but in order to shew the degree in which disease among these European troops has originated locally30 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE The Thayetmyo women are unanimous in the confession that natives of India and European soldiers are by far their chief maintenance. There were 19 prostitutes remaining on the register in the beginning of the year, 34 were added, and the names of 30 were struck off during the year (women's names are now struck off after a continued absence of two months). In the year 1876 the corresponding numbers were 18 remaining, 16 added, and 15 struck off. On the 31st December 1877 there were 23 women on the list, and one the same date of the preceding year this number was 19. Registered prostitutes carrying on their business are subjected to a fee of 1 Rupee each per mensem. When in hospital, or from other causes incapacitated from acquiring resources, no demand on them is made. Rupees 219 have been received this year in registration fees. The attendance at the periodical examinations has been satisfactorily regular. The average number absent on each occasion was 2.7, or 10 per cent. of average number on the list. Venereal disease has been much less prevalent amongst the prostitutes during the past year than it was in 1876. In 1877 the cases admitted were31 LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. hope it may strike the readers of this report that a necessity for the compulsory registration exists of all who shall henceforward be convicted of illegal intercourse, for this is a measure I would strongly advocate. Extract from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Tonghoo, by Surgeon T. C. H. SPENCER. The Commissioner of the division and all others in authority in Tongboo are agreed that the building is badly situated ; it is at the extreme end of the Native town, and at a considerable distance from any other public building, such as the jail, or dispensary, or police-station, and is therefore free from any and all supervision. The result of this is that during the year some of the women while undergoing treatment in the hospital made their escape, and were assisted in so doing by men from outside, The average strength of British troops for 1876 was 458; during the year there were 73 admissions for venereal disease ; out of this number 17 men contracted the disease elsewhere, leaving 56 due to Tonghoo. During the year 1877 the average strength of British troops was 417, the admissions for venereal disease were 45 : this shows that the working of the Contagious Diseases' Act has not made much progress during the last year. I think every allowance should be made for a frontier station like Tonghoo, which is open to infection from all sides, Spans, Kareens, and people from Upper Burmah and also from the south daily come into Tonghoo ; and that these people import the disease into the district is proved by some of the men who are infected, seeking admission to the Civil Dispensary for treatment. Shoaygheen, where there is a detachment of the 17th Regiment gadras Native Infantry, and Wenjan, a large Native town a short distance from the British frontier, are two well-known sources of venereal disease. Amongst the registered women n Tonghoo there have been 63 admissions during the year ; the cases were of a mild nature and readily yielded to treatment. A few days suffice to render them healthy, and, as a rule, the women at the weekly examination present a very clean appearance, so much so that I am very pinch inclined to think the British troops do not contract disease altogether from these women, but occasionally from the camp-followers and others in the bazaar, who call themselves respectable married women. It is a noteworthy fact that all the registered women are Burmese, not a single native of India being on the register, although there is a considerable population of the latter class in Tonghoo. A fresh batch of these women (camp-followers) arrive in the station with each relief of European troops, There is no doubt that the British troops consort with some of these women, but it is extremely difficult to prove the fact, there being no European Inspector of Police to watch the movements of the suspected ones. When I assumed charge of this hospital in March 1877, there were 15 women on the register. At the present time there are 72 on the register. They present themselves every Friday morning for examination, and are personally inspected by the Surgeon in charge of the hospital. During the year 27 women were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non- attendance at the weekly examination, and punished accordingly by fine or imprisonment. I think the former mode of punishment is felt more by these women than imprisonment.

In 1877 the rate per thousand of cases of primary syphilis to total admissions was 292.99, while in the year under review it rose to 396.44, a proportion fraught with imminent peril to the troops. In Civil Lock Hospitals also, as will be seen from the annexed statement, there was an increase in the ratio of admissions for primary syphilis, although to a less extent :6 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Years Ratio of Admissions per 1,000 of Strength. 1874 185.73 1875 (Tonghoo included) 193.22 1876 179.27 1877 231.27 1878 250.20 Commencing with 1874 there has been in each year of the series, with the exception of 1876, a progressive increase in the aggregate of admissions.

Amongst the troops of the European garrison the admissions under the same heads were as follows:LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 11 and the risk which the soldiers encounter in consorting with unlicensed women. The prostitutes on the roll were very irregular in attendance at inspection, and those suffering from disease are said to evade this ordeal if possible, as they dislike the detention in hospital. The great increase in the number who absconded or withdrew their names from the register in 1878 is worthy of notice, and is no doubt due to the dislike which the prostitutes entertain to constant surveillance. In most cases it is to be feared the reasons given for withdrawal from the roll are mere feints, and the woman on effecting her object begins afresh as an unlicensed prostitute in some other part of the station. The chief features of the working of the Lock Hospital during the two past years may be summarised as follows:12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE to the hospital at Kamptee for treatment, when found diseased. The reasons for this step are the great expense of the institution compared with results, and the inefficiency of the working of the Act, inasmuch as only prostitutes in Seetabuldee are registered, while there is a large number of unregistered women in the neighbouring city of Nagpur, whom it would be found inconvenient to bring under supervision. 20. Thayetmyo.LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 Bad as the results were in 1877, they were infinitely worse in 1878, and call for very energetic measures for the suppression of disease. Fortunately the increase of disease amongst the prostitutes did not affect its prevalence amongst British troops as will be seen from the following figures:14 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. treated. This shows that the form of primary syphilis prevailing was of the milder type, which is a subject for congratulation so far as regards the efficiency of the army. It is the malignant form of sore which entails constitutional ravages and renders the soldier a premature invalid. Viewed in this light, there- fore, the results of the working of the Contagious Diseases' Act in 1878 was not inefficient, taking into account the increase in the number of prostitutes and the great prevalence of disease amongst the fresh accessions. There can be no doubt, I think, that the number of indurated sores would have been larger, and cases of secondary syphilis more frequent, but for the protective agency of the Lock Hospitals. It must be remembered, too, that unlicensed prostitution is perhaps more rife than ever, and that venereal disease is not confined to prostitutes, but pervades to a very serious extent the general population. Altogether the past two years in most stations of Southern India have been most perilous ones for the young, celibate British soldier. Women previously chaste became prostitutes to obtain food, and professional prostitutes leaving outlying villages pressed into the larger towns with the same object. The host of unlicensed women therefore became largely increased and importunate under the pangs of hunger, and all things considered it is not to be wondered at, that venereal diseases have been so prevalent amongst the troops. One important fact has been communicated to me by the Surgeon-General, British Medical Service, viz., that not a single case of hereditary syphilis was observed amongst the children of British soldiers during the year. This circumstance has not of course the same significance under the short service system and frequent movements of regiments, as it would have had under the old order of affairs, but still it is interesting and satisfactory. Viewed from all points the working of the Act and Lock Hospitals in 1878 has not been ineffectual, but its good effects have been masked by the outcome of the unprecedented increase of unregistered women. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) COLVIN SMITH, M.D., Acting Surgeon-General, I.M.D.

This has been felt by the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Forces, and he has moved the Lock Hospital Committee on the subject, and has promised his support to any recommendation they may make for an increase of the detective agency. A meeting of the committee was held on the 28th November 1878 and the subject discussed. It was admitted that the strength of the detective agency was insufficient and must be increased, but to what extent has not as yet been settled, but I have reason to believe a recommendation to double the present strength will be made immediately.

Further steps to prevent the spread of venereal diseases are also taken by deputing one police head constable and three constables for the special duty. The unlicensed prostitutes are, as a rule, only registered when totally unfit to carry on their trade. Every newly registered prostitute has been admitted into the hospital, on first examination, in advanced state of some form of venereal diseases, with completely broken-down constitution. The registration can thus be proved to have been inefficient. The women directly or indirectly obtain tickets at their own accord, when they find no other means than hospital admission for their livelihood. The number registered during the past year was 47 against 99 in 1877. The number of non-registered prostitutes who voluntarily came for treatment has been 83, almost double that of the registered class, which composed generally of poorer classes of different castes from all parts of the district. The decrease in the registered number during the last year is partly due to the gradual subsidence of famine and partly to other causes. No fee is levied for registration. 359 women absented from the periodical examinations during the past year, and the irregularity was reported to the Cantonment Magistrate, who fined 6 absentees, and realized the sum of Rupees 5 thereby, and imprisoned several. Beyond an attempt to evade hospital admission no other cause can be assigned for the irregularity. Tri-weekly examinations of the registered women are carefully conducted at the hospital for detection and treatment of venereal diseases. The proportion of registered women under treatment for venereal diseases to the strength during the year has been 1 to every 1.90 against 1 to every 2.31 in 1877. The debilitated state of the constitution and the chronic stage of the disease on admission have necessarily lengthened the period of their stay in hospital. The predominant number of admissions for primary syphilis, both among the British troops and non-registered class treated at the hospital during the year, prove the infection of the troops by the unlicensed prostitutes to a greater extent than by the registered section. The total admission among registered women was 295, of which 195 were for gonorrhLOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 19 Statement showing the various forms of Venereal Diseases among the European Troops in the Cantonment of Cannanore for the year 1878.

Thirty-seven women were prosecuted for non-attendance, 27 being fined to the amount of Rupees 15 and 10 being imprisoned. Venereal disease has been much more prevalent among the prostitutes, and there has been a large increase of admissions during the year 1878, when compared with 1877. Gonorrh21 LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. The number of cases of syphilis primary among Europeans during the first half of the year, when the above-mentioned causes were chiefly in operation, was more than double that during the last six months, and this fact further corroborates the view I have taken with regard to the causation of disease. The subjoined statement has been prepared from the returns furnished by the Medical Officers of British troops:22 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE The number of women reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non-attendance was 50 against 67 in 1877; of these 36 were punished by being fined, and the remaining 14 were admonished. The amount realized by fines was Rupees 27. How far disease has increased among the women.LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 23 The women do not attend for inspection as regularly as they should be made to do; 267 reports of absence from inspection were made during the year at Saint Thomas' Mount, 67 at Poonamallee, and 51 at Pallavaram. Out of this number 10 cases in the Mount were punished by imprisonment, 10 cases at Poonamallee were also punished by imprisonment, and 14 at Pallavaram had the same punishment. All the registered women are required to attend at the Lock Hospital every Friday; those who say they are menstruating are examined by the Hospital Assistant and by the nurse, and if such be the case no further examination is made; they are returned as present with M. against their names. Women found diseased are detained in hospital for treatment and dieted. There is a head constable and three constables appointed specially to look after the prostitutes of the station; the head constable attends the weekly examination and makes a note of any women kept for treatment; the Matron and Hospital Assistant are always present during the examination; the women in hospital are examined twice a week24 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE The room itself is 14 feet in height, 12 feet in breadth, and 16 feet in length, and is enclosed with a compound wall, gate and door to the west, and is in every way situable for the purpose for which it was erected. The following table shows the extent to which venereal disease prevailed during the past three years in the British troops:LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 25 The proportion of sickness to the average strength not only varies in each regiment but also contrasts unfavorably with the previous year. Moreover, the difference in the amount of sickness in the 1-21st Fusiliers with a strength of 738 men against 792 in the 2-16th Regiment is one for which it would perhaps be difficult to assign any satisfactory reason. Last year the civil detective police was strengthened by an additional constable, thus increasing their strength from 3 to 4, but even this number does not appear to be sufficient for the amount of supervision which they have to exercise over an area embracing seven square miles. That there was ample warrant for an increase to their number is evidenced by the fact, that during the five months of 1877 three constables detected and brought for registration only 14 new prostitutes, while in the remaining seven months the addition of 1 constable and the substitution of 3 new men, in lieu of those who were previously on this duty, had the effect of increasing the number of fresh registrations to 139. Throughout 1878 159 additions were made to the total. From this there is very little doubt but that a still further increase in the number of the detectives would be attended with corresponding benefit. The registered prostitutes of this place are not subject to any fees. During the year under review the attendance of the women was not regular at the periodical examinations, which, as stated in previous reports, are held twice a week, viz., on Tuesdays at Secunderabad and on Thursdays at Trimulgherry. The average number of prostitutes who attended the weekly examinations was 211.71 as compared with 133.68 in 1877 and 103.34 in 1876. The maximum monthly average examined was 242.22 and the minimum 191.06. In the preceding year they were 206.51 and 100.8 respectively. The number of prostitutes who absented themselves individually was 211 as against 70 in 1877. The manner in which the absentees were dealt is thus shown by the Cantonment Magistrate:26 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE prostitution immediately without reporting the fact to the authorities; she had to be brought on the register for a second time.

The control of prostitution is under the supervision of the police, but as a special measure, a written statement is taken from every soldier reporting sick from venereal disease as to when, where, and from whom he contracted his illness. The patient then proceeds to the bazaar in company with a constable to whom he points out the woman who communicated the disease to him, she is thereupon taken to the Lock Hospital, examined and (if found diseased) admitted for treatment. In my opinion the registration has been efficient. It embraces all classes of women practising prostitution. It extends over an area of more than 5 square miles. The number of fresh admissions to the register during the year 1878 has been 8 as compared with 16 registered during 1877. No registration fees are levied. The women have been, as a rule, regular at the weekly examination. All cases of non- attendance are brought to the notice of the Cantonment Magistrate, who punishes them with imprisonment (simple) should they deserve it. No fines are awarded. All the prostitutes are examined at the Lock Hospital weekly, and if found diseased they are admitted and treated. There has been a decrease in the number of admissions for the following disease during the year : primary syphilis 29 as compared with 39 of the year previous ; and an increase in the case of gonorrhLOOK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 33 Europeans.

Of the registered women I have estimated that at least two-thirds of them have suffered from secondary syphilis at same period of their existence, and I believe about one-half of these have been so affected as to be never safe, that is to say, any discharge or abrasion is sufficient in them to communicate the disease to others. I always look upon these women with suspicion and admit them to hospital for the slightest discharge or abrasion. The class of prostitutes to which registration extends includes the very lowest kinds of women of all classes, namely, Burmese, Natives of India, and Europeans, the latter chiefly being Germans or Russians. There is only one Eurasian on the list, a remarkable fact considering the size of Rangoon. I have reason to believe that there are many women in Rangoon of a higher class than those usually registered, who ought to be licensed as prostitutes, and who spread disease on a much larger. scale even than their sisters on the register. Whether Registration Fees have been levied, and at what rate.36 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE of the Deputy Surgeon-General ; the names have been sent in, but they have not yet gone, and I think it would be advisable before they go that measures should be taken to prevent their return. At the same time, if possible, it would be desirable to introduce measures to prevent diseased prostitutes coming to Rangoon. It was recommended last year that the Police staff should be increased the necessity for it was perceived by the Chief Commissioner, who mentioned it in his remarks. No alteration has however yet been made. In last year's report also the insufficiency of the Medical staff was pointed out, and the Chief Commissioner, in his remarks, said that applications should be made to have it increased. In accordance with his views an Apothecary was applied for, but one has not yet been supplied. I would point out, further, that the fixed establishment is also much below that of other first-class Lock Hospitals. Extract from the Annual Report of the Lock Hospital, Thayetmyo, by Surgeon. F. J.

All due allowance was invariably made for illness or other justifiable cause which happened to keep any away. Only those who wilfully or intentionally violated the law were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate, who punished each offender as she deserved. The women attended once a week at the Lock Hospital, where they were examined, and all cases of disease admitted for treatment. There was much less disease amongst the women during the year 1878 than there was in 1877. For the last five months there were only 2 admissions; one of these was for general debility and the other for slight gonorrhAPPENDIX. 11

A Native Police Sergeant is attached to the hospital, who serves notices on the women who attend weekly for inspection; their tickets are returned to them filled up, if healthy; if not, they are detained in hospital, and when discharged are made over to the Police. The detective agency consists of five constables and one European Chief Constable, who, besides his ordinary duties, superintends the work of the constables. The Assistant Superintendent of Police also details two European Chief Constables once a week for the purpose of visiting all European soldiers admitted into hospital for venereal disease, with the view of finding out from the men the prostitutes who diseased them. Registration has been well carried out, though the number on the register is considerably below that of last year; but this fact is mainly attributable to the departure from Bangalore of a large number of famine-stricken women who were compelled by their necessities to practise prostitution, and who, now that the famine is over, have returned to their villages. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations has been very regular with one exceptionMILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 9 them registered on their discharge from hospital, and then only when they again became so diseased that they were unable to practise their trade. The attendance at the periodical inspection has been very irregular; the cause of the irregu- larity is attributed to the attempt to evade hospital admission, as many of them on being brought for examination by the Police were found diseased. Four hundred and nineteen were reported for non-attendance, but this number includes women who were known to have left the cantonment for months, their names being kept on the register as they might return; small fines and imprisonment were awarded, the amount realized being Rupees 2-10-0. The admissions have been 343, showing a decrease of 35 against the previous year. The diseases have been of mild type, but in many cases attended with suppuration of inguinal glands, causing the period of treatment to be much protracted. I have found the same to occur among the men, but in them the long stay in hospital produced depression and an anæmic condition, invariably followed by fever necessitating stimulants and quinine in the treatment. The women who were the longest in hospital were the non-registered prostitutes who had neglected their disease before admission. Of 22 women pointed out by soldiers, only 7 were found diseased and detained for treatment. No admission among the women was due to non-venereal affections. Extracts from the.

No Cantonment Sub-Committee assembled during the past year. Clandestine prostitution prevails largely. The registered prostitutes are, as a rule, dirty, miserably clad, and physically repulsive, while the first-class prostitutes and those in compara- tively good circumstances are permitted to practise their calling without interference. It is possible, however, that the latter are not resorted to by the European troops. During the year 33 prostitutes were registered, being an increase of 8 as compared with 1878. Five of the newly-registered women were employed as sweepers, &c., in the regimental lines and 5 were emigrants from the Mysore District.

Two hundred and seventy-two reports of absence were made against 385 the previous year. Twenty-seven only were punished; of these 25 by fines and 2 by imprisonment. There has been a decrease of 12 admissions over previous year. The average daily sick has been 12.74. The establishment has doubtless done much to control both the extent and virulence of the disease. The majority of cases have been readily amenable to treatment. I am of opinion that the registered prostitutes are not responsible for anything like the number of cases of venereal disease which occur among the men of the Royal Artillery; the proximity of the Mount to Madras I believe has much to do with it, and there is no doubt a great deal of clandestine prostitution existing which the Police has been unable to reach. Nineteen paupers were admitted, having voluntarily come to hospital for treatment. I would suggest more power be given to the Police, and am of opinion that the registra- tion would be far more effectually carried out under European supervision. Some trustworthy man from Royal Artillery would be invaluable, as he would be thoroughly acquainted with the haunts of the men.

During the first seven months of the year, when there were four constables, the newly-registered women numbered 101, giving an average of 14.42 in each month. During the remaining five months, when there were five constables at work, the new registrations numbered 81, at an average of 16.2 per month. These averages clearly point out that an increase to the detective staff is attended with a corresponding increase in new registrations as well as in the arrest of absentee prostitutes. In respect to working of the Regimental Police, the Officer Commanding Royal Artillery reports:MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 Months. Primary Syphilis. Secondary Syphilis.

With reference to the 274 admissions into the hospital, there have been 31 less than during the preceding year; out of those four were from non-venereal affections. No menstrual women were detained under treatment. Extract from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Wellington, by Surgeon-Major R. W. CLIFTON. No Cantonment Sub-Committee exists at this station, the supervision of the rules being carried out by the Cantonment Magistrate and the Medical Officer jointly. The measures that have existed for some time past for controlling prostitution, and especially for preventing the danger arising from unlicensed prostitutes practising their calling within the lines, still continue in force. These consist in the patient that reports sick from venereal disease proceeding to the Wellington bazaar in company with a constable, to whom the woman who communicated the disease to the patient is pointed out. The woman is then taken to the hospital and there treated if found diseased. I consider that the registration has been efficient. It embraces all classes of females that practise prostitution, and extends over an area of more than five square miles. There has been an increase of 11 admissions to the register during the past year, the total number for 1879 being 19 as compared with 8 during the year 1878. As a rule the women have been regular at the weekly examinations. Those women who absent themselves are taken before the Can- tonment Magistrate, who inflicts a fine or imprisonment as each individual case requires it. During the year there has been an increase in the number of admissions from the following diseases:APPENDIX. 5

The efficiency or otherwise of the registration of the Women does not apparently affect to any extent the prevalence of disease amongst the troops. Thus at Bangalore and Cannanore there was a decline of venereal complaints amongst the latter in the face of diminished registration, and at Secunderabad an increase, although registration was more efficient than in 1879. Further information as to the stational prevalence amongst the troops of venereal diseases generally during the past ten years will be found in Table F of Appendix, and in Table C a statement of the diseases which presented in 1880. The usual information is also given in Tables G and H, as to the comparative prevalence of venereal diseases in stations at which Lock Hospitals existed and at those in which such institutions were not in operation. 8.

Amongst the troops there was a decrease in the amount of venereal disease, the ratio of admissions per mile of strength having fallen from 247.66 in 1879 to 191.26 in 1880. The cases of primary syphilis amongst the men were in the ratio of 402. per mile of total admissions for venereal complaints. 12 Kamptee.7 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. mentioned that while the highest admission rate for primary syphilis per 1,000 of strength in a station in which there was no Lock Hospital was 90.0, the admission rates at Bellary and Bangalore, where the Contagious Diseases Act was in full force, stood at 236.7 and 233.7 respectively. This contrast takes no notice of the smaller number of men located in stations at which there are no Lock Hospitals ; but making due allowance for this, the discrepancy in the rates is at least significant.

The Europeans and East Indians have ample room in two wards, one 26 feet long and 18 wide, the other 18 feet square.

There has been a diminution in the number of cases of primary syphilis accruing among the British troops stationed at this place, while on the other hand gonorrh10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Bangalore. There is now, however, one Head Constable employed, who reports to the Superin- tendent the absence of registered prostitutes from examination, and brings to notice any women he may observe plying their trade without a license. Registration, in my opinion is very insufficient for the purpose. The soldiers of the garrison rarely, if ever, contract disease from those prostitutes which are registered. The men of the cavalry and artillery especially consort with grass-cutters and others who infest the neighbourhood of the barracks and lines. It will also be seen that the disease is more frequent among young soldiers (as those of the 13th Regiment) than among the older hands, as was evinced by the marked diminution of cases when the 67th returned to the station from Afghanistan. The number registered this year has decreased, only 22 fresh women having entered their names against 63 of the previous year. This is probably owing to the detective agency having been withdrawn as mentioned above. The women generally have been punctual in their attendance at the periodical examina- tions. The admissions among the women during the past year have been 712 against 639 in 1879. The cases generally have been very virulent.

The control of prostitution is under the police. One Head Constable and three Constables are deputed for this special duty ; one of them attends at the regimental hospitals daily, and takes information from soldiers when admitted for venereal diseases; but this is of little benefit, as no woman has ever been detected thus either diseased or practising prostitution clandestinely. Some one of the Constables continually patrols the lines for the detection of unlicensed prosti- tutes, and the Regimental Police assist in preventing prostitutes frequenting the lines. Regis- tration has not been efficient, judging from the number of unlicensed prostitutes who came of their own accord for admission when in an advanced stage of disease and they could carry on their trade no longer. The women have not been regular at the periodical examinations. The irregularity is attributed to the attempt to evade hospital admission, as the majority of them, on being brought for examination by the police, were found diseased. 104 individual women were reported for non-attendance ; short periods of imprisonment only were awarded, and no fines were inflicted. All prostitutes are examined at the Lock Hospital and, if found diseased, admitted and treated. There has been a decrease of 38 in the number of admissions compared with the previous year. The disease has been of a mild type, and only five cases of secondary syphilis occurred; among the men this disease has been mild, and but few cases of secondary syphilis were con- tracted in the station. Sixty-six non-registered women applied for admission when in advanced stages of disease, and consequently were a long time under treatment. I can only suggest that more stringent measures should be taken by the police to detect unlicensed prostitutes. Until I brought it to notice the police were under the impression. that their duty was only to detect disease among the prostitutes already registered,

The Officer Commanding H.M.'s 2-16th Regiment has, on my recommendation, selected two reliable men " for the prevention and detection of any women visiting the lines for the purpose of prostitution, and for the supervision of such native women employed in the lines as they may suspect to be carrying on prostitution." Clandestine prostitution is believed to be practised largely, partly by the wives of natives in menial employ in the European lines, and by women the servants of soldiers' wives ; and the soldiers who may contract disease from such women are very reluctant to point them out to the police, preferring to accuse a registered prostitute who, when brought to hospital, is generally found to be free from disease. During the year 20 prostitutes were registered, and 17 of the number were found diseased when brought to hospital, viz., primary syphilis 2, gonorrhoea 5, leucorrh12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE women of this class from entering the lines or barracks. The medical officers of these corps inform me that the Regimental Police have orders to prevent women of doubtful appearance from entering the lines or loitering in their immediate neighbourhood, and .that soldiers admitted into hospital for venereal diseases are taken on the day of admission in search of the women who diseased them whenever they state that they can point her out. The exclusion of the women from the lines is, however, the really beneficial measure, as it is very rarely that a soldier really points out the woman from whom he contracted disease. Registration cannot be looked on as efficient, taking into consideration the facts that only 60 women are on the register with a civil population estimated at 47,500 and a military force (even now when the strength is temporarily considerably below the average) of nearly 800 Europeans and about 1,300 or 1,400 native troops. Registration extends over an area of 4 miles. There are two classes of women on the register, viz., first class for Europeans and second class for natives. The close proximity of a large town to a cantonment renders it com- paratively easy for men to consort with unregistered women who cannot be detected unless the men will point them out. During the past year two women have presented themselves voluntarily for registration, and nine have been convicted by the Cantonment Magistrate of carrying on clandestine prostitution and placed on the register. The women have, as a rule, been regular in their attendance at the weekly examinations. During the year 17 registered women were fined by the Cantonment Magistrate for breaches of Lock Hospital rules, and chiefly for absenting themselves from examination. The total number of admissions among the registered women during the past year was considerably less than in 1879, the number for 1879 being 114 and in 1880 only 91. As among the soldiers the decrease has been chiefly under the head of Primary - Syphilis, the admissions for which numbered 20 in 1880 against 39 in 1879. The type of disease has been almost invariably mild, and the sores of the soft kind and virulent cases and hard sores have, I believe, been equally exceptional among the men. The results of the working of the institution during the past year appear to me to be very encouraging, and I hope they will lead to further exertions on the part of the police to bring all women practising prostitution within the limits of the cantonment under the notice of the Cantonment Magistrate, and endeavour to get them put on the register, and so still further reduce the dangerous element of clandestine prostitution. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Saint Thomas' Mount by Surgeon-Major R. DEMPSTER. Owing to the large number of admissions for venereal disease from men of the Royal Artil- lery the police have been particularly on the alert and have worked well, and have compelled the more regular attendance of prostitutes for the weekly examinations ; but, notwithstanding their vigilance, there are doubtless many unlicensed prostitutes within cantonment. Every effort is made to bring suspected women on the register. Prostitutes belonging to the Mount have been generally regular in their attendance at the weekly examination, but not so those from Pallávaram and Poonamallee ; the latter have to come from a distance of 4 and 7 miles respec- tively. All registered prostitutes are required to attend at the hospital for examination every Friday. Those found diseased are admitted. During the past year there was a large increase of admissions, 221 against 189 the previous year, and the average daily sick was 31.08 against 12.74. Owing to the great prevalence of venereal disease among the men of the Royal Artillery increased precautions were taken at the weekly examinations, and the women, with the least suspicion of disease, were detained for a few days for subsequent repeated examination, and were then either admitted or discharged accordingly. This practice and also the detention of women with menses, and from this fact that women were kept longer in hospital, a clear 10 days after all trace of disease having disappeared before their discharge, will account in a great measure for the increased admission and average daily sick. Many cases of disease have been detected by men being encouraged to point the women infecting them. The majority of cases of gonorrhoea and primary syphilis were readily amenable to treatment, but not so those of ulceration of os uteri, which have been, as a rule, of an obstinate character, pointing to their non-venereal origin.

Admissions for Primary Syphilis into Lock Hospitals.MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY 5 These figures show not only the difference in the amount of venereal diseases at the several stations, but also the extent to which this varies at the same station in different years. One favorable result brought out by the statement is, that at all the stations there was less venereal disease in 1881 than in the previous year. Bangalore and Bellary are acquiring a bad pre-eminence as regards venereal complaints. In 1879 Bangalore had the highest admission rate of any station in the command, While in 1880 it stood third on the list, and in 1881 it was second. As regards Bellary it was second on the list in 1879, and in each of the two past years its admission rate has been considerably in excess of that of any other station. Whether the excessive amount of disability from venereal diseases at these two stations be due to an unusual prevalence of these amongst the local civil population, or to exceptional facilities for clandestine prostitution, or to both causes combined, it is impossible to say. The efficiency or otherwise of registration does not appear to have any uniform effect on the prevalence of venereal disease. Thus, at all the stations, except Secunderabad, there were fewer names on the roll in 1881 than in 1880, and therefore, presumably, more diseased women at large, and yet the fore- going figures show that venereal disease declined. In fact, this is only what might be expected, seeing that the Contagious Diseases Act does not in any town practically reach more than a small fraction of the women actually amenable to its rules. Table C in Appendix shows the nature of the venereal complaints from which European troops suffered in 1881, while further information as to the stational prevalence of these diseases, during each of the past ten years, is given in Table F. Tables G and H are also submitted as usual, showing the comparative prevalence of venereal diseases at stations at which Lock Hospitals were in operation, and in those at which such institutions did not exist. 9. Cost of Lock Hospital Patients.6 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE The admissions for venereal diseases amongst the European troops in the station show a reduction, having been at the rate of 316.05 per 1,000 strength against 430.04 in 1880. Of the total admissions 208 or very nearly one-half, were, for primary syphilis. 11. Bellary.MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 7 The number of cases admitted into the Lock Hospital was 754, or exactly the same as in the previous year ; but there was a slight difference in the amount of primary syphilis, the admissions for this cause having been 487 in 1881 against. 517 in 1880. Out of an average of 364.18 on the register, an average of 302.60 presented them- selves at the weekly inspections. The form of disease is reported to have been mild amongst registered, and severe amongst unregistered, women. Amongst the troops the admission rate per 1,000 strength for venereal com- plaints was 247.39 against 329.24 in 1880. Of these admissions, 191, or 321.54 per mille, were for primary syphilis. There was, therefore, a reduction in venereal disease amongst the troops in this large station. 16. Wellington.EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1881. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon A. F. DOBSON. No change has taken place in the hospital accommodation during the period under report. The European and East Indian women are located in two wards, which are well ventilated and ample for the requirements, as are also the wards for Natives, of which there are three in number, each 56 feet long by 15 feet wide, and well suited for such patients. The Superintendent of Police keeps a register of all brothels and prostitutes within an area of fourteen square miles, as specified in the special Contagious Diseases Act sanctioned for Bangalore ; the same applies to prostitutes who consort with Europeans. Tickets are given to all registered women, and they are bound to attend at the hospital for examination at least once a week, their absence being reported to the Superintendent of Police. If contaminated in any way they are detained in hospital for treatment. Registration is, I consider, very insufficient for the purpose. The soldiers of the garrison rarely, if ever, contract disease from those prosti- tutes who are registered. The detective agency, which consisted of one European chief con- stable and five constables, was reduced to one Native head constable in March 1880, from which date up to the present time a steady decline has taken place in the number of women on the register, and from the fact of there being only 85 registered prostitutes with an estimated Native population of 71,144 within the area over which the Contagious Diseases Act Rules are in force, it necessarily follows that clandestine prostitution must be carried on to a considerable extent in the town and cantonment of Bangalore. During the year only three East Indian women were convicted by the Civil authorities for practising their trade without a license, and none came voluntarily to be registered. There has been a decrease of 61 in the total number of admissions compared with the previous year, and the diseases have been for the most part amenable to treatment ; but those which proved obstinate, and necessitated lengthened detention in hospital, were chiefly attributable to the existence of displacement of the uterus, whereby, owing to the excitement caused by frequent sexual intercourse, permanent irritation of the intra-uterine mucous membrane is set up, ending in "chronic endometritis," and as all such cases are included under the head of gonorrh10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE admitted for treatment. The women so pointed out have always been registered prostitutes, and, in the majority of cases, were found free from disease, or, if diseased, they as a rule were, suffering from some affection other than that for which they had been pointed out by the soldiers ; con- sequently I am of opinion that the soldiers point out the registered women apparently to shield the women who are the real source of their disease. I believe clandestine prostitution is carried on largely, and I doubt much whether the police, who are entrusted with the execution of the Act, bestir themselves as much as they might, as they are themselves men of very immoral habits, suffering largely from venereal diseases. The following table shows the castes of the prostitutes on the register :MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 11 The only virulent cases were among women brought on the register for the first time, and, as a rule, these women were in a very diseased state. Men of the Royal Artillery admitted to hospital for gonorrh12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. Natives. The area over which registration extends is seven square miles. There is a decrease in the number of prostitutes this year, the number being 64 against 69 in 1880. The women have, as a rule, been regular in their attendance at weekly examinations. Three examinations are made weekly. Venereal diseases among the women have decidedly decreased during this year, the total number of admissions being only 72 against 91 in 1880 and 114 in 1879. Parallel with a decrease in the admissions for primary syphilis among the troops in garrison is seen a fall in the number of admissions from the same cause in this Lock Hospital, and it is hard to resist the conclusion that they are related as effect to cause. The type of the disease is stated by the Medical Officer in his last report to be mild, because the sore was of the soft kind. The same point has been noticed this year, but no such inference drawn, as it appears to be an open question whether primary syphilis in women does not often, nay, almost always, take the shape of a soft sore though infecting the individual. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad, by Brigade-Surgeon E. S. CLEVELAND. The Cantonment Committee looks after the working of the Lock Hospital. No special measures were adopted for the control of prostitution ; all that has to be said is that a staff of detective police, consisting of a head constable and four constables, is deputed for the detection and apprehension of women who carry on prostitution with the European soldiers. These men apprehended during the year 121 such women against 128 in 1880. As far as it is now carried on, registration may be said to have been conducted with efficiency, for within the last three years no less than 431 women have been brought on the register, the number registered during the year being 121 against 128 in 1880. In an average strength of 364.18 women the average number that presented at the weekly examinations was 302.60. In all there were 739 absences against 567 in 1880. Individual absentees numbered 171 as compared with 190 in the previous year. It may here be noted that the institution has tended to induce a large number of these fallen women to enter a married life. In support of this fact it may be mentioned, that in the year 1879 10 women abandoned their original calling ; in the following year 32 ; and in 1881 31, making a total of 73. Of the large number of cases admitted in the British hospitals very few of the men are prepared to show the source of contagion, a matter much to be regretted, for if their assistance is enlisted much may be done to mitigate the evil arising from their intercourse with both the registered and unregistered women. Better results have been attained in the year under review. Although the number of women on the roll increased from 335 in 1880 to 382 in 1881, the number of admissions into the hospital was the same as in the previous year. On the whole the working of the Lock Hospital rules has been successful during the year, inasmuch as the number of admissions in the European troops has diminished by 7.45 per cent. In connection with this subject it may here be noted that it would be a very great advantage if the civil detective police were placed more closely in concert with the regimental police than at present, so that the action of both may bring better results than what has been achieved till now. Another point which claims notice is the practice which now prevails among the prostitutes of Secunderabad taking shelter in the city. Instances have lately occurred in which these women, while pretending to be residents of the city, have come into the cantonment after dusk and carry on their calling. If the city police were moved to have an eye on them, and the Secunderabad police at same time instructed to see that these women do not come into the cantonment to spread the disease, some advantage would be effected, especially as the city women are generally found to be diseased in severe form.

Another remarkable fact which the abstract shows prominently is, the very great difference between the admission rates at the several stations. Thus at Cannanore it was 138.02 per mille of strength, while at Bellary there was a ratio of 394.90, or more than 2½ times greater. Bellary still retains the notoriety of showing the largest number of admissions, but the rates were also very high at Bangalore and Secunderabad. Whether these excessive rates in 1882 and previous years were due to the greater prevalence at those than other stations of venereal complaints amongst the civil population, it is difficult to say ; but it seems probable, looking at the continuity of the phenomena, that this was one cause. It is further possible that race peculi- arities and habits may have some influence on the prevalence of venereal diseases amongst the people of certain districts of the country. Thus at Bellary and Secunderabad the lower classes are mostly Telugu people, and Bangalore, although strictly speaking in a Canarese District, is not much beyond the existing limit of the Telugu country. The chief point in connection with this is the circumstance that it has been said, that Telugu people show less dread of, and consequently suffer more from venereal diseases, especially syphilis, than the other races of Southern India. Of course this suggestion, as to the cause of the high rates of venereal diseases amongst British troops at certain stations, cannot be stated with any degree of certainty ; but it seems worthy of consideration and further enquiry. Table C in Appendix shows the nature of the venereal complaints from which the European soldier suffered in 1882, and in Table F information is given as to the stational prevalence of these diseases during each of the past ten years. Tables G and H show as usual the prevalence of venereal diseases at stations in which Lock Hospitals were in operation and at those in which they did not exist. 9.

On the other hand, there was an increase in primary syphilis, the rate of admissions per mille of total cases of venereal complaints having been 528·09 in the latter against 395.06 in the former period. 17. General Remarks.EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1882. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Garrison Surgeon A. F. DOBSON. The Contagious Disease Act rules, which were sanctioned in 1871 for Bangalore and subsequently modified by the Chief Commissioner of Mysore, are in force. The Superintendent of Police is delegated with the duty of keeping a register of all brothels and prostitutes within the area of 14 square miles as implied by the Act, but since the withdrawal of the detective agency, which in 1879 consisted of one European Chief Constable and five Constables, besides two European Chief Constables detailed for the purpose of finding out from all European soldiers admitted to hospital for venereal diseases the prostitutes who had infected them, a steady decline has taken place in the number of women on the register, and from the fact of there being an average of only 86.65 registered prostitutes for the year with an estimated European and Native population of 78,000 very conclusively proves that the rules, as they now exist, have little effect in controlling prostitution. On the 1st January 1882 there were 85 women on the register : 18 were added; making a total of 103. During the year six removed their names under representation to the Superin- tendent of Police, either of leaving the station or of returning to a virtuous life and seeking shelter in the convent ; 15 absconded and one died from heart disease in the Civil Hospital, leaving 81 registered prostitutes at the close of the year. One Native Head Constable attends at the hospital daily to report to the Superintendent of Police the absence of registered pro- stitutes from periodical examinations and to see that they are supplied with tickets; as all such women are compelled to present themselves for examination at least once a week, and if contaminated in any way, are detained for treatment. This man is also expected to bring to notice all women whom he may detect plying their trade unlicensed ; but, in not a single instance has he succeeded in doing so throughout the year. Those who have been newly registered, with one or two exceptions, come of their own accord for that purpose. The women have been very punctual in their attendance. The average number present at the periodical examinations was 47.86, of whom 14.70 per cent., being found diseased, were detained for treatment : only 49 were reported for being absent : imprisonment was awarded in 10 cases and 39 were warned. The number of admissions during the year has been 224 less than in 1881. This diminu- tion was chiefly due to women with their monthly illness having ceased to be admitted since early in the year, and only such as appeared doubtful cases were subsequently detained in hospital. The cases under treatment were very similar to those referred to in last year's report ; the affections, however, which proved obstinate occurred, for the most part, among the European and East Indian women, and were attributable to ulcer os uteri and ulcer cervix uteri; these necessitated very careful treatment and lengthened detention in hospital to effect a complete cure. I am satisfied that the large amount of venereal affections amongst the European troops is the result of clandestine prostitution carried on in the vicinity of the barracks with grass- cutters, coolies, and other female followers of the regiments and in unlicensed brothel's scattered over the cantonment. To put down this evil special measures are imperative. The registration of a small number of women can be but a slight safeguard against venereal disease. The rules as they now stand only affect those women who consort or are suspected of consorting with Europeans ; but until they are made to extend to all women who carry on indiscriminate prostitution, and an efficient detective agency is established for the purpose of apprehending and placing on the register all women found having illicit intercourse, so long will the Lock Hospital be restricted in its sphere of usefulness and the soldiery remain exposed to the ravages of venereal diseases and their consequences. In conclusion I would beg to report the suggestion which has so frequently been made 10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bellary, by Surgeon MURPHY. The prostitutes are under police supervision, the establishment consisting of one Head Constable and three men. All women found prostituting are placed on the register. Every woman has to attend hospital once a week for examination, and she is provided with a ticket, on which the dates of inspection are entered. When a soldier is admitted to hospital with venereal disease contracted in the station, he is taken to the bazaar, and, if able to identify the woman, she is sent to the hospital for examination. Registration is not efficiently carried out. No non-registered women sought admission. There is a great prevalence of venereal disease amongst the European troops in this station. The disease is probably contracted, in a great measure, from the unregistered prostitutes. The women on the register are very weak, and a great many resort to prostitution as a liveli- hood from necessity. There is no proper supervision of the houses in which the prostitutes reside ; it would be advisable to have well-built houses set apart for them and some sanitary supervision exercised over them. If the Acts were more fully enforced, there would be a great diminution in the amount of venereal disease. When the bazaars were put out of bounds during the prevalence of cholera in the month of December, there was a marked falling off in the number of cases of venereal admitted into the Station Hospital. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Cannanore, by Surgeon K. C. SANJANA. The cantonment sub-committee has not been convened during the year. One Head Constable and three Constables are detailed to this institution to carry out the rules ; of these, one Constable attends the European Regimental Hospital daily in the mornings, and the men admitted for venereal diseases are made to go and point out the women from whom they contracted the disease to the Constable, who brings the so-pointed-out women to the Lock Hospital where they are examined, and, if found diseased, are admitted into hospital for treat- ment. About the working of the Lock Hospital, I am of opinion that the system is a remarkably good one and ought to be a means of preventing venereal diseases to a considerable extent, if not effectually ; but unfortunately there is a certain source of evil which is a great cause of failure. Here I allude to those prostitutes who carry on their profession clandestinely, and I have reason to believe that the soldiers have recourse to this class of women more than to the registered prostitutes. I doubt much that the police, who are entrusted to carry out the Act, do exert themselves much as they should to detect these women. The subjoined table shows the castes of the prostitutes on the register :11 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. unmarried men's quarters. Still there is the strongest reason for believing that the source of what disease has existed, was to be found amongst those whose names are not inscribed upon the register. Nor can this be wondered at when the difficulty is looked fairly at of discriminating between honest women and clandestine prostitutes by the police when estimating the female population of a cantonment which spreads over an area of something like seven square miles. Indeed it would not be possible to sift the virtuous from the vicious without throwing into the hands of zealous constables a most dangerous power of extortion and of a grave invasion of all private rights. Registration cannot be said to have been efficiently maintained; for the total number of individuals upon the list was only, on an average, for the year 53.36, while only one new name was enrolled. It is not credible that in so large a military cantonment, with its floating population of numerous followers of all kinds, this number can represent even a majority of all those whose business is the practice of prostitution. Still there is ground for the impression that the women of the laboring classes in the station are, if not strictly virtuous, far from being openly immoral. The area over which registration extends is nearly seven square miles. There was a small decrease in the number of names on the register. In the previous year the maximum was 61, while, in the past it was 58. If this number could be held as a true standard by which to measure either the morality or the health of the community of Kamptee, it might be contemplated with satisfaction. But it is valueless for any such purpose, and only points to the worthlessness in a civilized country of all attempts on the part of Govern- ments to control prostitution or eradicate its physiological results. In every country, Pagan and Christian, from the dawn of civilization, rulers have spared no efforts to, first, prevent prostitution, and then in despair, at their failure, to subject it to State control. But no good came of these philanthropic attempts anywhere. Even the Papacy, when it possessed not merely a moral authority, but a real secular arm such as no other government ever did or ever can again exercise, failed in every country in Europe to hold this vice in check ; and only shut its eyes to its hideousness and its terrible results when it had exhausted in the combat every weapon its well-filled armoury supplied it with. Of the primary form of syphilis there occurred only 19 cases, a number closely similar to previous years. It is at first sight odd that in no case did any secondary disease show itself. It may be that former attacks have imparted to these subjects complete immunity from any constitutional form of the malady. It is also curious that no instance of a true typical Hunterian chancre presented itself since I have held charge of the institution. No relation whatever could be traced between the disease in the European Hospitals and that in the Lock Hospital. I cannot suggest any changes in the rules under which the establishment has hitherto been administered. As an institution for the relief of suffering, and the diminution of the spread of a great scourge, it possesses a great claim to consideration. But attempts to extend its benefits to a very much larger class than those for whom it has been hitherto maintained must involve, as already mentioned, an activity on the part of the police that I am not disposed to urge, know- ing how inseparable from such activity are measures not quite justifiable on many occasion. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Saint Thomas' Mount, by Brigade-Surgeon R. DEMPSTER. I am of opinion that the police have not been properly on the alert during the past half- year, as no fresh registrations have taken place at Saint Thomas' Mount. Both first and second class prostitutes are brought on the register within the area of Saint Thomas' Mount, Guindy, Saidápet, Pallávaram, and Poonamallee. The prostitutes have been generally reuglar in attendance on examination days. Seventeen were reported to Magistrate for being absent, of these 6 were warned and 11 punished by fine or imprisonment. All prostitutes are required to attend at hospital for examination every Friday. Those found diseased are admitted into hospital, and those having menses are detained for examina- tion on cessation. In-patients are examined twice a week by the medical officer, and daily by the medical subordinate. The general working of the Lock Hospital during the past year has been satisfactory as shown by the decrease of admissions for venereal disease among men of the Royal Artillery. Only one case remained on the returns of the Station Hospital at the close of the year. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad, by Surgeon-Major B. WILLIAMSON. For exercising supervision over the working of the Lock Hospital rules, no special com- mittee exists, but the Cantonment Committee attends to them. No special measures were adopted for the control of prostitution.
12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE From the increase which occurs year after year, it is evident that registration is progres- sive. Up to the end of 1881, 382 women were on the register, and during the year under review 80 have been added, making in all 462, which gives 1 to 7.24 of the European strength of the year. Compared with the number registered in 1881, there has been a decrease of 54. Whether there was scope for a larger number being brought on the rolls or not is a point which the magisterial authorities can alone state; but, judging from the increase in the number of admissions among the European troops, one cannot but conclude that a large number of women are still at large, who frequent with European soldiers, unnoticed either by the Civil or Military detective police;or that women, who obtain permission to remove their names either on the score of leaving the station or getting married, continue to remain in the station without the police knowing it and ply their calling unobserved. Several instances have occurred wherein it was found that, after obtaining leave, they remain in the cantonment and disease the soldiery. In an average strength of 323.65 females, the average number of women who attended at the weekly examinations was 285.90. In 1881, the figures were 364.18 and 302.60 respectively. Individual absentees rose from 171 in the past to 186 in the year under report, but the total absences were less, that is 453 against 739 in 1881. Statistics relating to removal from the rolls of names of women and the causes for such removal are given below for the past three years :MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon-Major A. LONG. The Lock Hospital at Wellington is a detached bungalow, distant from the hospital of the depôt 90 yards. It consists of one ward with one office and examination room partitioned off at one end. There were 66 admissions to hospital during the year. The cases were all of mild character. No cantonment sub-committee exists at this station, the supervision of the rules being carried out by the Cantonment Magistrate and the Medical officer in charge. I consider the registration has been efficient. During the year there has been a decrease in the number of venereal diseases when compared with the two preceding years. The hospital is sufficient to meet all the requirements of the station. A new latrine has been built during the year and the old one removed. A fence of rose hedge also put all around the compound. 4

The compound is surrounded by a wall, and the necessary out-houses are conveniently situated. There has been no change in the Cantonment Committee, which is composed of11 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. No registration fees were levied.

All prostitutes are required to attend at hospital for examination every Friday. Those found diseased are admitted into hospital, and those having menses are detained for examination on cessation. In-patients are examined twice a week by the Medical Officer, and daily by the Medical Subordinate. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad by Brigade-Surgeon G. S. W. OGG. There has been no change in the Lock Hospital buildings during the year. As explained in previous reports the hospital consists of two blocks of buildings affording accommodation to 69 patients. The hospital buildings are well constructed, well ventilated, and, in all respects, suitable. During the past year the number of patients has been occasionally in excess of the accom- modation, and it has been necessary to put some of the women in the hospital verandahs. In the month of May, and again in June, I brought to the notice of the Cantonment Magis- trate the urgent need for increased vigilance on the part of the police in arresting absentees from the examinations, who are, for the most part, diseased, and in detecting clandestine prosti- tutes. In consequence of these representations the Chief Constable and two Constables were removed from their duties in connection with the Lock Hospital, and replaced by more efficient men. The result was an increase in the number of registrations and a diminution in the list of absentees. The admissions for venereal in the British Hospitals fell notably in July and August. In the months of September and October the admissions again rose, for a reason I will indicate, to fall again in November and December. The cause of the rise in venereal admissions in Septem- ber and October I believe to have been the following :13 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. given by an infected soldier in detecting diseased women. In the cases where they pretended to know the women, they either pointed out women who were free from disease, or women already under treatment in the Lock Hospital, who, in many cases, denied any knowledge of the soldier accusing them. The form of disease among the registered women was, for the most part, of a very mild type and readily yielded to treatment, whereas among the newly-registered women the type of disease was, as a rule, severe, and they had in many cases to be detained long in hospital to effect a complete cure. Three non-registered women voluntarily applied for treatment at the Lock Hospital. Two were suffering from syphilis and one from gonorrh14 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. Extract from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon W. L. LANE, A.M.D. The Lock Hospital at Wellington is a detached bungalow, distant from the Station Hospi- tal 90 yards. It consists of one ward with one office and examination room partitioned off at one end. The hospital out-buildings and compound have been kept perfectly clean, and the sanitary condition was satisfactory. No Cantonment Sub-Committee exists at this station, the supervision of the rules being carried out by the Cantonment Magistrate and the Medical Officer in charge. There are two Constables attached to the Lock Hospital for the purpose of looking after the prostitutes and preventing as far as possible, illicit prostitution. When a man reports sick for venereal disease, he proceeds to the bazaar, accompanied by a Constable and Hospital Serjeant and points out, if possible, the woman who communicated the disease ; the woman is then taken to hospital and admitted if diseased. I consider the registration has been efficient ; it embraces, as far as prac- ticable, all classes of females that practise prostitution, and extends over an area of five square miles. The women are examined weekly at the Lock Hospital and admitted for treatment if found diseased. As a rule, the women have been regular at the weekly examinations ; those who absent themselves are reported and are taken by the Constable before the Cantonment Magistrate, who inflicts a fine or imprisonment, as the case may demand.

Deductions from these figures as to cause and effect are not very reliableMILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 5 reference to that table that the admissions for venereal are not diminishing.

In Cannanore the admission rates for 1884 were a little more than double those of 1883. At Kamptee and Wellington also there was a considerable increase in admissions. Bangalore shows a large decrease and Secunderabad a slight decrease. Bellary furnishes a high rate of admissions for venereal to strength and has done so during the past ten years. The rates fluctuate in other stations ; in Bellary it is steadily high. Bangalore shows a very satisfactory decrease, the rate of admissions for venereal being lower in 1884 than in any of the six preceding years, the decrease during 1884 being quite as remarkable as the increase noted in 1883. 10. Cost of Lock Hospital patients.6 Annual Report On The MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 7 The soldier cannot be coerced into accepting the registered women provided for him, and the class of women who do register for his benefit are not likely to attract him. 19. The following table is instructive : it shows the strength of European troops and the number of admissions for primary syphilis and gonorrhEXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1884. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon J. LEONARD. There has been a decrease both in the total number of venereal cases and under each class of disease throughout the year, viz., 543 to 646 of the preceding year, the comparison being 263 primary syphilis, 51 secondary syphilis, and 229 gonorrh10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE among the troops as compared with the number of women admitted into the Lock Hospital for the same affections, shows a want of activity in carrying out the instructions of the Contagious Diseases Act by the police which demands immediate amendment. In conclusion, it only remains to be stated that, in addition to the suggestion made above, it is essential that lines should be constructed in a locality entirely set apart as the residence of prostitutes, and that soldiers contracting disease from any other quarter should be severely punished. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bellary, by Surgeon H. THOMPSON. Medical charge during the year was held by Surgeon F. H. S. Murphy, M.D., Army Medical Department, from 1st January to 25th August 1884 ; Surgeon W. H. Thornhill, M.D., Indian Medical Service, from 26th August to 20th November 1884 ; and Surgeon H. Thompson, M.B., C.M., Indian Medical Service, from 21st November to 31st December 1884. The committee has not assembled during the year. All women found prostituting have their names put on the register. When a soldier is admitted to hospital with venereal disease contracted in the station, he is asked if he can identify the woman from whom he contracted his disease, and, if so, he is taken in charge of a Corporal and the Head Constable to the bazaar and points her out. The woman is then taken to the hospital for examination. There has been an increase of 2.31 per cent. in the total number of admissions compared with the previous year. There is a marked decrease in the admission for primary syphilis (55 cases) and an increase for gonorrhMILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 11 Only healthy women should be registered, and not the class of females we have at present on the list. They are broken down ; their genitals, in many instances, being one mass of cicatrices ; and when healed, they are allowed out of hospital. In about a week they are admitted again as bad as ever. A number of them are nothing more or less than pensioners upon the Government, living in hospital the greater part of the year. I would suggest that these broken-down patients be removed from the register. The wall surrounding the hospital compound requires to be raised at least three feet and a solid gate is required in place of the barred one now in use. There is nothing to prevent the inmates leaving the hospital during the night, ply their trade for a few hours, and return in the early morning ; the wall is so low. The Chucklers' mud huts near the south wall should be removed ; they use the foot of this wall as a latrine ; and on examination days I have noticed them looking into the hospital compound from their huts. The natives should be prevented using the open space to the north and east of the hospital as a public latrine ; it is a nuisance, the natives coming quite close to the hospital wall. Until the police have more power to arrest unregistered prostitutes it will be impossible to impede the spread of venereal disease amongst the troops. The Lock Hospital itself cannot effect much, and the men can have access to women other than those that come under medical super- vision; and until promiscuous intercourse can be effectually prevented, or until the soldiers are more careful and circumspect in their actions, I cannot myself hope for much improvement in the returns of venereal disease. Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon A. E. J. CROLY. Nothing of interest. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Cannanore, by Surgeon M. E. REPORTER. The Cantonment Sub-Committee has not been convened during the year. About the working of the Contagious Diseases Act, I am of opinion that it would be very satisfactory if the police were to be more efficient and painstaking in detecting women who carry on clandestine prostitution, as I have observed that almost every newly registered woman was found diseased, and undoubtedly they were carrying on prostitution and spreading disease previ- ous to their being registered. The rules under clause vii, Section 19 of Madras Act I of 1866, are in force within a radius of four miles from the cantonment, and the estimated population within this area is 30,000. The subjoined table shows the castes of the prostitutes on the register :12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Registration is not as efficient as it might be. The total number of women on the list on an average was 51.71, an increase of 2.62 on the previous year. This seems small for a cantonment with an average strength of 764 British troops, a cavalry, and two native regiments, and a very large civil population. Those who are on the register are only those of the very lowest and poorest classes, and inadequately represent the extent to which prostitution is practised in the station. Registered prostitutes are of two classes, those for Europeans, and others for natives. The area over which registration extends is seven square miles. Remarks by Brigade Surgeon J. McN. Donnelly, M.D. :MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad, by Surgeon-Major Æ. M. Ross. The Cantonment Committee exercise supervision over the working of the Lock Hospital rules, and. matters relating to the institution are discussed at their monthly meetings. No special measures were undertaken for the control of prostitution beyond those hitherto in force. These, it may be repeated, consist in the deputation of a body of six constables of the civil police, whose sole duty is to detect and apprehend women who carry on prostitution with the European soldiers. The Lock Hospital rules extend over an area of seven square miles and are applicable to the class of women who carry on prostitution with the European soldiers. From the fact of new women being brought on the register year after year, there is no doubt that registration is tolerably efficient, although the number brought on the rolls was 28 against 73 in 1883. The only way to account for the fewness of the number admitted on the register in 1884 is that, owing to the active operations of the police in the previous years, only few escaped registration. This is further evidenced by the fact of the admissions for venereal diseases among the British troops being less than in 1883. There is, however, still a great deal of clandestine prostitution, especially among the grass-cutter women attached to mounted corps, herdswomen, &c. In all, in the year under report there was an average strength of 355 prostitutes against 339.58 in the previous year. On the 1st January 1884 there were 363 women on the books, during the year 28 were registered, making in all 391. Of this number, 85 against 38 in 1883 got their names removed. On the last day of the year there remained 306 women. For the most part the forms of the disease were mild and readily yielded to treatment, excepting in the case of newly brought in women and women who absented themselves at the periodical examinations. In these instances the patients had to be detained in hospital for a longer time than the ordinary cases of registered women.

Though the following table is compiled up to a later date, still it is so instructive that it is worthy of notice here. It gives the comparative prevalence of secondary syphilis at the several stations during the years 1884-85 and 1885-86 :EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1885 Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon D.

Asst. Quartermaster-Genl., Mysore Division. The Cantonment Magistrate. The Assistant Superintendent of Police. Secretary : The Medical officer in charge. The Contagious Disease Act, with the modifications of the late Chief Commissioner of Mysore, is still in force, and the Superintendent of Police continues the duty delegated to him of keeping a register of brothels and prostitutes within the area of 14 square miles implied by the Act. There has been a decrease of three in the number of registered prostitutes on the list, which is no doubt due to the very lax manner in which measures are adopted for the detection and registration of women carrying on clandestine prostitution. The Police have orders to arrest any unlicensed prostitute frequenting the lines and take her before a Magistrate. There were 79 prostitutes on the register at the close of 1884, to which 7 were added during the year under report, making a total of 86 ; of these, 10 either removed their names, absconded, or died, and there remained 76 on the 31st December 1885. No registration fees are levied. The women were regular in their attendance at hospital for examination. Forty-nine were reported for non-attendance ; of these, 12 were imprisoned and 37 warned. Three days in the week, viz., Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, are set apart for examining registered prostitutes, and unregistered prostitutes are examined at once when sent to hospital. The women are subjected to a careful examination and treated according to the disease from which they suffer. Four hundred and fifteen women were treated during the year, showing a decrease of 109 as compared with those of 1884. This decrease is due to the small number of British Troops stationed at Bangalore during 1885. Only one constable is employed at this large station for the detection of illicit prostitution, and although he is very energetic, it is impossible for the rules to be efficiently carried out without further aid. At a small place like Wellington two constables are employed on this duty, yet in Bangalore one is supposed to be sufficient. I would strongly recommend that an application be made to the Resident to increase the number to three, including the present constable.
10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bellary, by Surgeon H. THOMSON. Annual Medical Report of Lock Hospital, Bellary, from 1st January to 31st March 1885. There has been no change in the working of this institution during the past three months. The number of prostitutes remaining on the register on the 31st December 1884 was 73. Six have been registered during the past three months : total 79. From this, 11 were struck off. Sixty-eight on register on 31st March 1885. The number of sick remaining in hospital on 31st December 1884 was 28. The number admitted during the three months ending 31st March 1885 was 66.

The Medical officer then in charge (Dr. Bateman), in reply the whole subject, and suggested in conclusion the following additional checks on the spread of disease :12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE only 38 have been referred by the soldiers to registered women, the majority of whom were found on examination to be free from disease, and those diseased were already detected by the Medical Officer at the weekly examinations previous to their being so pointed out : this demonstrates how little reliance can be placed on the testimony of soldiers as to the sources of their infection. Registration has been so far efficient that 24 new females have been brought on the rolls during the year, 23 diseased and one free ; but the hilly nature of the surrounding country and outlying villages, not under direct British control, afford opportunities for prostitution being secretly carried on. All classes of prostitutes, whether natives, Eurasians or Europeans, who consort with soldiers come under registration, if they reside within an area of seven square miles. In the year 1883, the number of new additions to the register was 73, in 1884, 28 and in 1885, 24. This falling off, and the fact that all but one of the newly registered prostitutes were found diseased, would seem to indicate slackness on the part of the Police on the work of detection, as had they been more active, the number found free from disease ought to have greatly exceeded those infected. Again, the large number of those newly registered who were diseased shows forcibly the danger of remissness on the part of the Police in their work. The attendance has been so far satisfactory that out of an average strength of 303.48, the number that presented themselves for periodical examination was 264.94 ; but it has been found that when women know themselves to be diseased, they evade as far as possible attendance at the Hospital, and this may be expected from a class of women much addicted to drink and whose pursuits the restraint of a Lock Hospital, notwithstanding all its comforts, materially interferes with. It has been ascertained that women absent for a considerable period from the regular inspections have, as a rule, when apprehended and sent for examination, been found diseased. As already stated, the control over prostitutes extends to all residing within an area of seven square miles whether in the town or the cantonment proper. These are compulsorily registered and treated in the Hospital at Secunderabad. Medical examinations are held both at Secunderabad and Trimulgherry on Tuesdays and Thursdays, respectively, in rooms specially provided for the purpose. On the whole the results exhibited for the year under consideration are more favorable than in 1884 and the eight years preceding. The cantonment and town has lately extended considerably, and the area of seven square miles over which the Lock Hospital rules at present operate excludes many of the chief localities from whence disease is introduced, such as Bolarum and parts of Secunderabad bordering on the places where troops are actually located. A good deal of disease is also brought in from Chadarghat and Hyderabad, as well as from the country lying on the outskirts of the cantonment and under the jurisdiction of the Native State. Unless measures be adopted to sufficiently extend the sphere of control and stringent steps taken to check clandestine prostitution by women from outside taking advantage of the rocks, jungles, topes, and plains immediately bordering on this station, it will be impossible to reduce disease to any considerable extent. Commanding Officers of Native Regiments often apply to the Lock Hospital to bring on the rolls women who exclusively consort with their men and infect them. There can be no doubt that many of these women also consort with European soldiery, but, to escape being brought under the rules, allege that they are under the protection of particular sepoys. This matter was brought to notice by the Medical Officer in charge of the Lock Hospital in his reports for 1878 and 1879, but the Resident observed thereon, in his review of the latter report (Vide No. 955, dated 28th June 1880, para. 8), that as the Cantonment Committee did not make it the subject of remark or recommendation, he was not disposed to take any steps towards the extension of the rules to this class of prostitutes. It is suggested to the Cantonment Committee that great advantage would result by bringing these women also on the register. It must be said of the Lock Hospital here that although it is beset with many difficulties, yet, it has on the whole worked to the decided benefit of the troops, the population generally and the inmates themselves. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Cannanore, by Surgeon M. E. REPORTER. Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Cannanore, for the year 1885, from January to March 1885. The Cantonment Sub-Committee had not been convened during the year. One head constable and 3 constables were deputed for enforcing the rules of the Con- tagious Disease Act. Of these, 1 constable attended the Station Hospital every morning, and the soldiers admitted for venereal disease proceeded with him to point out the women from whom they contracted the disease. The women thus pointed out were brought to the Lock Hospital
MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 to be examined, and, if found diseased, were admitted into hospital for treatment. The soldiers invariably pointed out registered prostitutes who, when examined, were in most cases found to be perfectly free from any venereal disease, and, if found diseased, the complaint of the women were quite different to that of the soldiers. Registered women were pointed out simply to screen those who carried on clandestine prostitution in the cantonment. About the working of the Contagious Disease Act, I am of opinion that it would be very satisfactory if the police were to be more efficient and painstaking in detecting women who carried on clandestine prostitution, as I had ,observed that almost every newly registered prostitute was found diseased, and undoubtedly they were carrying on prostitution and spread- ing disease previous to their being registered. The rules under clause vii, Section 19, of Madras Act I of 1886, were in force within a radius of 4 miles from the cantonment, and the estimated population within this area was 30,000. During the year no women were added to the register, nor did any remove their names off it. No registration fees were levied. The average number of prostitutes who attended the weekly examination was 22.0, and the average number reported for non-attendance, 2.8. The sum collected by fines amounted to Rs. 3. Registered women were examined on every Tuesday at the Lock Hospital, and, if found diseased, were admitted into hospital for treatment. There was a considerable decrease in the number of admissions into hospital during the period under notice as compared with the number admitted during the corresponding periods of 1884. This was owing to the great prevalence of venereal disease amongst prostitutes last year, the cause of which was explained in the report for that year. The most prevalent diseases during this year have been primary syphilis, and leucorrh14 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. them gonorrhAPPENDIX.

Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon D. S. E. BAIN. There is a Cantonment Sub-committee composed as under:10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Bellary, by Surgeon J. D. T. RECKITT, M.S. Annual Medical Report of Lock Hospital, Bellary, 13th March to 31st Dec. 1886. There has been no change in the Cantonment committee which is composed ofMILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 11 It seems to me that very little interest is taken by the Police in the working of the Contagious Disease Act at Bellary, and that consequently much more venereal disease prevails than would otherwise be the case. It would be of material service if special and suitable quarters were built for the residence of registered prostitutes. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon-Major W. KEIR. Since last report the Lock Hospital has been removed into a bungalow about 300 yards to north-east of Station Hospital. There are two wards capable of accommodating 12 patients, an office, inspection room, store-room, with adjoining auxiliary kitchen, wash-house and latrine. The wall around it requires to be a few feet higher; otherwise it is a very suitable building and in good sanitary condition. Rules were carried out under Cantonment Magistrate, advised by the Medical Officer. Two constables were entertained to prevent illicit prostitution, and supervise the regis- tered prostitutes. The registration extends over an area of 5 square miles, and includes Chuckler, Paria and Hindoo prostitutes, and is fairly effective over them within this area. Eight were added to, and sixteen removed from the register during the year, but the average is practically the same as last year, 31.95. There has been a considerable number of absentees due to pregnancy, sickness, some absconded and a few absented themselves without cause, but on the whole the attendance has been very fair. Seventy-six were reported for non-attendance as against 44 last year, and the fines awarded amounted to Rs. 18-8-0 as against Rs. 6 during 1885. All women found diseased at the weekly examination at the Lock Hospital were detained and treated there until cured. The rules are sufficient when efficiently carried out. In proportion to the vigilance of the Police in apprehending illicit prostitutes and supervising those on the register, does the disease diminish both amongst the women and the troops. This year they are to be credited with more zeal in carrying out their duties, and to this chiefly the great decrease of venereal amongst the troops is to be attributed. The Police duties are carried out under considerable difficulties, as there are no proper quarters assigned for the prostitutes, their vocation being carried on a field. This has been represented, but as yet no action has been taken. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad, by Surgeon-Major G. F. BEVAN. The work of supervising the operations of the Lock Hospital throughout the year was carried out by the Cantonment Committee as in preceding years. In last year's report some suggestions were made for the better control of prostitution, and these suggestions have been acted on as far as possible with a consequent material decrease in disease among the troops. Without the cordial co-operation of the Cantonment Magistrate and Assistant District Superintendent of Police, such favorable results could not have been obtained. Great care has been exercised in the granting of leave to prostitutes and in their removal from the register. It may be remarked that only those have been struck off who, after diligent inquiry, were found to have left the station entirely. The Regimental Police as usual worked satisfactorily in keeping off prostitutes from the barracks. The civil detective police were useful in making arrests of suspected women or those pointed out by men as having infected them. The measures taken regimentally are given in the following extracts:12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CENTRAL STATION HOSPITAL, Royal Artillery. "Men detailed from Batteries." "One non-commissioned officer and 4 gunners to try and prevent all crimes, and arrest offenders." "Result very good." SOUTH STATION HOSPITAL, INFANTRY REGIMENTS. Her Majesty's 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment. "One sergeant and 16 privates to look after barracks, married quarters, canteen, coffee shop and prison." "During the day 8 men go round the barracks, and 2 men are employed, morning and evening, in the officers garden." "At sunset 2 men are on duty in the bazaar to keep order. 2 do. on married quarters. 1 man on coffee shop. 1 do. on canteen." Her Majesty's 2nd Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. "One sergeant, 1 corporal, 15 privates, who are employed about the barracks. Their orders are to prevent any prostitutes loitering about the lines or in the vicinity, and any found solicit- ing prostitution are handed over to Civil Police. They are then prosecuted and the result has been satisfactory." All womenMILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 13 A good deal of inconvenience was experienced during the year by the constables posted to this hospital, being temporarily detached for short periods for casual civil duties. This formed the subject of a reference to the Cantonment Magistrate and the Resident District Superintendent of Police, through the Deputy Surgeon-General, but the matter has not been definitely settled. It is very desirable that men once posted should not be detailed for other duties, as it furnishes a good excuse for remissness in the performance of their detective work. It will be observed that the number of venereal cases contracted beyond cantonment limits is alarmingly great this year also. So long as the area over which the Contagious Diseases Act extends is not enlarged, and soldiers are permitted to wander about beyond the compass of seven square miles, an efficient check cannot be exercised over clandestine prostitution. Absentees almost always take refuge in Bolarum and other places outside limits and consort with soldiers. Experience has again shown that it is also advisable to make the rules applicable as well to "prostitutes frequented by Native soldiers" for the reasons stated in the report for 1885. The rules framed under Clause 7, Section 19, Act XXII of 1864 for the Cantonment of Secunderabad do not appear to discourage the extension of the provisions, but seem only to desire that they shall be limited to "prostitutes frequented by Europeans," unless it shall be otherwise so ordered by the Local Government. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Cannanore, by Surgeon E. COUTTS. Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Cannanore, from 15th July to 31st December 1886. The institution was closed experimentally from 31st March 1885 to 15th July 1886, but re-opened on that date, on the recommendation of the Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces. No Cantonment Sub-committee exists, its duties being performed by the Cantonment Magistrate. One head constable and three constables were detailed for enforcing the rules of the Contagious Disease Act. One of these attended the station hospital daily at the hour for seeing the morning sick, and accompained men found suffering from venereal diseases, for the purpose of having the women, from whom the disease was supposed to be contracted, pointed out, and brought to the Lock Hospital for examination, and, if necessary, admission. As stated in last year's report the men in most cases pointed out registered prostitutes, who, when examined, were found free from disease, or were suffering from an affection, different to the one that they were accused of spreading. This probably occurred in some cases through non-recognition of the women, but, undoubtedly in other cases, it was done for purpose of screening women carry- ing on illegal prostitution. Several cases occurred where the men when closely questioned admitted having contracted their disease from such women, but the latter were rarely traced, either because the men could not tell where they lived or because it seems a point of honor with the men to avoid getting, as one of them expressed it, such women into trouble. Better results would undoubtedly follow a more stringent application of the rules by the Police against illegal prostitution, but it must be admitted that they have great difficulties to contend with, and a sub-committee should be formed to exercise a general supervision over their proceedings. Endeavours were made at the station hospital to induce the men to co- operate with the Police in restricting illegal prostitution, but only with slight success. Apart from statistics there can be no doubt that the re-opening of the institution did good to the extent of preventing women borne on the register from constantly spreading disease. The following statement shows the extent to which they were active centres for the propagation of disease. Of 38 women, 32 on first examination were found diseased, and of these, 11 were suffering from primary syphilis, 1 from secondary syphilis, 14 from gonorrh14 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Kamptee, by Surgeon-Major G.

Representation on this important subject has been made to the Superintendent of Police. Dhais have not been employed. It is a matter for regret that the Police are not more active in detecting women who carry on clandestine prostitution, of whom there must be a greater number than 30 for the three stations which come under the head of St. Thomas' Mount. If some reward were offered, probably women would come forward and register themselves especially when diseased. An instance occurred during the year under report in which an East Indian woman sought admission to the Lock Hospital for treatment, suffering from gonorrhAPPENDIX. 5

The admissions at Ban galore and Secunderabad were consider ably less than for the previous year, while there has been an increase at St. Thomas' Mount. The increase at Bel lary and Cannanore is accounted for by the Lock Hospitals at both these stations having only been open for a part of the year 1886. 5.Statistics of sickness among the women.-The following table shows the numbers treated, including remained, the average daily sick, and the average stay of each case in hospital during the past five years :- Years.

Omitting Bellary and Cannanore, we have for 1887 number treated, including remained, 1,974, average daily sick 142·51, and average stay in hospital 26·35, compared with 2,012, 139·15, and 25·24, respectively, for 1886, or a decrease in 1887 of 38· in total treated and an increase of 3·36 in average daily sick, and of 1·11 in average number of days in hospital of each patient. 6.Admissions into Lock Hospital for primary syphilis.-The statistics for the past five years are given in the following table :- Years.

Excluding Bellary and Cannanore, we get a total of 249 admissions for primary syphilis and a total of 1,830 admissions for all causes for 1887, against 471 and 1,870, respectively, for 1886, giving a ratio of cases of primary syphilis per 1,000 of total admissions of 136.06 for 1887 compared with 251.87 for 1886.

It is to be expected also that admissions for primary syphilis should be comparatively rare among women who have long carried on prostitution. 8.Rates of admissions for all forms of venereal disease amongst British Troops.

Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon D. S. E. BAIN. There is a Cantonment Sub-Committee composed as follows :10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Bellary, by Surgeon J. D. T. RECKITT, M.S. There has been no change in the Cantonment Committee which is composed ofMILITARY LOCK HOSPITAL, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 11 increased, and this has resulted in more regular attendance and no escapes from the Lock Hospital, and the diseased women have been more easily subjected to medical treatment. I cannot but still be of the opinion that the Contagious Disease Act at Bellary is taken little interest in, otherwise more women in such a large population of 60,000 would have come on the register. It has been a careful object throughout the year to keep those on the register as free from disease as possible, and in order to find out how so much venereal disease was most certainly contracted from unregistered women (particularly during the very hot months, May and June), almost all those registered were detained for a month, and it was seen that venereal diseases among the troops rather increased than diminished. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital, Cannanore, by Surgeon-Major N. B. MAJOR, M.S. No Cantonment Sub-Committee has existed. The duties have been performed by the Cantonment Magistrate whose office has now been abolished, and for a considerable time the Native Town Magistrate was not invested with powers to issue warrants for the arrest of prosti- tutes; since my representations I believe he has been invested with the necessary power. One head and two subordinate constables are detailed for the special duty; a constable attends the station hospital every morning, and the soldiers admitted for venereal disease proceed with him to point out the woman from whom they have contracted disease; the woman is then brought to the Lock Hospital, where she is examined, and, if found diseased, admitted for treat- ment. The women so pointed out have always been registered prostitutes, and in the majority of cases were found free from disease, or, if diseased, they as a rule were suffering from some affection other than that for which they had been pointed out; consequently I am of opinion the soldiers point out registered women apparently to shield others who are the real source of disease. One woman pointed out was a patient under treatment at the time and had for some time been in the hospital; hence no possibility of its being corrects, nor was she under treatment for the disease the man had contracted. The total number of women pointed out were 14, of whom 9 were found free from disease, 4 were suffering from disease other than that for which they had been pointed out, and the other was found to be suffering from the same disease for which the man was admitted. So far as the registration system exists it is good, but there are some women in this station who have been struck off the roll at various times for the ostensible reason of getting married or being the concubine of one man. I have reason to believe that these women and others carry on illicit prostitution and that the police accept bribes, and so they are not brought on the roll of registered prostitutes. The registration extends to all classes of prostitutes within a radius of 4 miles from cantonment. Seven fresh registrations have been made this year, five of whom were found diseased. No registration fees are levied. The attendance of the women at the periodical examinations has been satisfactory. Ninety- eight eases were reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non-attendance, in many instances the same woman repeatedly; only 24 individual women were reported; twelve were punished by fines and 5 by imprisonment. Rs. 7 realised by fines were remitted to the treasury. The registered prostitutes are examined weekly at the Lock Hospital, and those found diseased are admitted for treatment. Fresh registrations or women pointed out are examined immediately on the intimation being received. For the six months in 1886 it will be observed the admissions for venereal were very high compared with 1887 (see table), but the hospital having been closed for a year may account for this. No venereal disease gave 28 in 1886 for six months and 66 for 1887, but the latter includes the whole year. There has been a marked diminution of virulent disease, but a slight increase in the non- venereal forms of disease amongst women. It would appear that the leucorrh12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon-Major W. KEIR. There is no Cantonment Committee. The rules were carried out under the Cantonment Magistrate on representation of any infringement by the Medical officer or police. Two constables are entertained to supervise the registered prostitutes and to prevent illicit prostitution. The registration extends over an area of 5 miles and has been fairly efficient. It includes Chuckler, Pariah, Muhammadan, Hindu and European prostitutes; 7 were added to, and 6 removed from, the register during the year. The average number is 30 against 31.95 last year. The attendance has been slightly better than last year but on account of sickness, preg- nancy, absconding and wilful absence, non-attendance has been considerable. One hundred and twenty have been reported to the Cantonment Magistrate for non- attendance. The fines awarded amount to Rs. 12-2-0 against Rs. 18-8-0 last year. The women are examined once weekly at the Lock Hospital, and all found diseased are detained until cured. The admissions compared with last year are as follows :13 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. Strength on register, 31st December 1886 30 Number added during the year 5 Total 35 Removed from the register during the year 7 Remaining on the 31st December 1887 28 There are no fees levied. The women have been fairly regular in their attendance. Thirty-two cases were reported for their non-attendance to the Superintendent of Police, 2 were fined at 2 annas each, 3 imprisoned, and the rest were excused. The women are examined every Friday morning, and those found diseased are detained for treatment. During the year there were 201 admissions against 149 in the previous year. There were 47 venereal diseases14 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Kamptee, by Surgeon-Major G. J. GIBSON. The Cantonment Sub-Committee met monthly during the year ; the following officers composed the Sub-Committee:15 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. loiterers. The military police have assisted the civil detective police. The Senior Medical officer of the North Station Hospital observes on this point that it is "a decided improvement on pre- vious arrangements and should be productive of good results." There is no doubt by this system a ready check is obtained and no time lost. To ensure the proper and regular discharge of this duty by the civil detective police, each man is required to keep a pass-book in which he has to get a daily entry from the provost sergeant in token of his having attended; and in the town of Secunderabad the detectives get their books attested daily by the head constable of the various police stations. Women of all castes and classes proved to be illicitly consorting with soldiers are brought on the register. During the year 1887, 37 additional cases were registered as compared with 35 for the previous year. All were found diseased, and most of them severely so. Sixty- three women were taken off the register on the plea of marriage, leaving the station, &c., but there is reason to believe that some of them are still carrying on their trade in the station or its vicinity. The total increase in the numbers, as compared with the preceding year, was 2. The registration has been so far found to be fairly efficient, and it embraces an area of 7 square miles. It may here be noted that the numbers registered during the first half-year was 5 and removals 40, whereas in the second half (which comprised Captain Muiris' term of office) the registrations were 32 and removals 23. No fee is levied on registration. The attendance of women during the periodical examinations has been regular. The number of prostitutes permitted by the Cantonment Magistrate to have their names taken off the register on the score of leaving the cantonment was 54, on account of marriage 4, other grounds 5APPENDIX. 5

Wellington.MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 9 " In the station hospital the numbers were 116 in 1887 and 86 in 1888. " (e) In 1888 it was frequently observed that men concealed their diseases, preferring treating themselves in barracks to coming to hospital. If this practice existed to any extent, as it easily might, in the case of very simple sores or ulcers which heal within a week, the admission rate to hospital would be very seriously affected. Moreover, I have quite recently been informed by two responsible officers of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry that some men of their regiment have been in the habit of treating themselves for venereal disease. Just now there is a patient in hospital suffering from primary syphilis aggravated by injudicious treatment out of hospital. In the annual yeport for 1887 the Medical officer then in charge apparently thinks concealment of disease, at all events, improbable. " (f) It is difficult to understand why the prostitutes suffered so much more severely from venereal affections in 1887 when the lines of treatment adopted were exactly the same as in 1888, except that police supervision with regard to compulsory attendance was not so well carried out as in the latter year. " I regret I am unable to explain adequately the cause of the decrease in the number of admissions for venereal disease in 1888, but, in questions of this nature, a number of vague circumstances always exist, which render a definite expression of opinion impossible." I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. A. HANBURY, M.B., Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces. From Surgeon C. QUARRY, Medical Staff, in charge of Lock Hospital, Cannanore, to the Deputy Surgeon-General, Her Majesty's Forces, Southern District, Coonoor, dated Cannanore, 5th April 1889, No. 41. In compliance with your memorandum No. 2230, paragraph 9 on G.O., 27th November 1888, No. 7996, I have the honor to submit the report called for on the expiration of three months after the re-opening tentatively of the lock hospital at this station. The re-opening dates from the 15th of December 1888, but inadvertently the compulsory attendance was carried on until the 27th January 1889. The following are the comparative tables for the three months prior to the re-opening and the ensuing three months after the re-opening of the hospital, the average strength of the men, respectively, being 98 and 88 ; also the detachments the same until the 27th of February when the Royal Fusiliers embarked for England, being relieved by the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, who arrived at this station same date, and on the 9th of March when the Oxfordshire Light Infantry embarked on return route for Bangalore, being relieved by the Norfolk Regiment detachment, arriving at this station same date from Gibralter, but the venereal cases which occurred amongst the Oxfordshire Light Infantry and the Norfolk Regiment were not contracted at Cannanore. TABLE I.10 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TABLE II.11 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1888. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon D. S. E. BAIN. Since the introduction of the voluntary system, there has been a considerable increase of primary syphilis cases among the European troops. Prior to this period, the average weekly admissions were only 2.9, but now they have already risen to 4.7. Thus, although registration was faulty, its withdrawal has almost doubled the most virulent form of venereal disease, and as a natural consequence, a similar increase in secondary syphilis may be expected during 1889. The sub-committee never met. Up to August 1888 the Contagious Disease Act, with the modifications of the Chief Com- missioner of Mysore, was in force, but since then the voluntary system has been in operation. The women were regular in their attendance up to the introduction of voluntary system, only 40 having been reported for non-attendance; of these 10 were punished and 30 warned. Up to August 1888, 135 women were treated in hospital, and of this number 26 have been detained during their monthly illness. Since August 1888, only 9 women have been treated in hospital. No dhaies were employed. The voluntary system in place of the Contagious Disease Act is a failure. This system was enforced during the last nineteen weeks of the year and has already caused almost double the number of weekly admissions for primary syphilis among the British troops. The reintroduction of the Contagious Disease Act is urgently necessary, if there is to be any attempt to control venereal diseases. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bellary, by Surgeon J. W. COCKERILL. The Cantonment Committee exists only in name. No meetings are held. All the registered prostitutes were under police supervision up to 12th August 1888, when both registration and compulsory examination ceased. My predecessor, Dr. J. D. T. Reckitt, states "at the present time, the voluntary system is utterly useless and abused as the women will not attend, and the number of inmates is rapidly declining and will soon be nil. It will take some time before the virulent form of syphilis which made such havoc among the men of the 2nd Bedfordshire Regiment whilst stationed in Bellary during the time the Contagious Disease Act was in abeyance12 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Cannanore by Surgeon-Major N. B. MAJOR, M.S. The building occupied as a lock hospital is a small detached private bungalow with accom- modation for 12 patients. It has been occupied from 1st January to 31st March, then experimentally closed and re-opened on the 15th December. It is suitable. No Cantonment Sub-Committee has existed: the duties have been performed by the native Town Magistrates. During the short period the hospital has been re-opened, uterine leucorrh13 MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. The women were examined and the diseased treated as long as the provisions of the Contagious Disease Act were in force, but now there is no attendance of prostitutes at hospital as it is not compulsory. No dhaies were employed. As long as there is police supervision and women made to attend hospital for examina- tion, they come, but they do not present themselves as a rule voluntarily for treatment. In September 5 women, and in October 2 were admitted; in November and December none presented themselves. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Belgaum, by Surgeon D. P. WARLIKER. As the Sanitary Medical officer of the Cantonment and the Medical officer in charge of the lock hospital were standing members of the Cantonment Committee and the latter used to bring before the Committee all subjects and wants of the lock hospital, it was considered unnecessary to appoint a Sub-Committee separately for the purpose of exercising special super- vision over the rules. Until the abolition of the Contagious Disease Act, the Military police had strict orders to prevent women loitering about the lines after hours, and when women were detected carrying on prostitution they were made amenable to the rules of the Contagious Disease Act. Now no such measures are taken to control prostitution. The women attended pretty regularly until the abolition of the Contagious Disease Act, since then the number attending for examination has greatly diminished. The services of the two detective dhaies were dispensed with immediately after the abolition of the compulsory rules. Their performance of duties was most unsatisfactory. I suggest that the Contagious Disease Act be again brought into force, without which a lock hospital is of very little benefit. The average number of prostitutes who sought voluntary examination in each month since the abolition of the Contagious Disease Act until the 31st December 1888 was 50.35. These numbers were decreasing gradually towards the end of the year. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Kamptee, by Surgeon T. H. CORKERY.

SURGEON-GENERAL'S OFFICE, HER MAJESTY'S FORCES, MILITARY DEPT., GOVT. OF MADRAS, OOTACAMUND, 10th July 1890. No. 1843. From SURGEON-GENERAL SIR J.A. HANBURY, M.B., K.C.B., Her Majesty's Forces, To THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, Military Department, Ootacamund. SIR, I HAVE the honor to submit, for the information of Government, the report on the working of the following Military Lock Hospitals in the Madras Command for the year 1889 :4 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE Under the voluntary system, therefore, only 118 cases were treated altogether during the year, while the average daily sick has been 13.88, compared with 123.39 for the previous year and 200.91 for 1887, when the Contagious Diseases Act was in full working order. It may be noted that the average stay of each case in hospital has nearly doubled in comparison with former years, an indication of the severity of disease existing among those voluntarily seeking admission. 4. Admissions into lock hospitals for primary syphilis.MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 5 compared with the average of the previous four years; and here it may be observed that primary syphilis, which in its after effects produces such an amount of inefficiency and invaliding, has proportionately increased to a greater extent than the milder forms of venereal affections. 7. Comparative prevalence of venereal diseases among British Troops at the several stations where Lock Hospitals were established6 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE strength of 508.11 compared with 375.85 for the previous year. Of these, 22.20 per cent. were for primary syphilis against 23.49 in 1888. 14. St. Thomas' Mount.MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, MADRAS PRESIDENCY. 7 EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE MILITARY LOCK HOSPITALS, FOR THE YEAR 1889. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bangalore, by Surgeon D. S. E. BAIN. Women are examined and treated whenever they come to hospital of their own accord. Under the new system it is impossible to state how far disease has increased or decreased among the women, but with the Act in force for the first twenty-three weeks in 1888 there were only 5 women admitted for primary syphilis, whereas 8 were treated in 1889 of their own free will, and these were the worst cases of the disease I have ever seen, the women having gone on as long as they possibly could without treatment. The voluntary system has now had a fair trial with disastrous results, not only for the British troops, but also for the women themselves, for whereas under the Act the latter came quickly under treatment, they now come only as a last resort and require prolonged treatment. If venereal diseases are to be controlled at all, the Act must be re-introduced . Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Bellary, by Surgeon-Major T. C. H. SPENCER. Under the present arrangement the hospital is kept open for the treatment of any woman voluntarily attending. There are no statistics to show how far the women are diseased, but those attending suffer from a chronic and severe type of the disease. The ratio of admissions amongst the British troops for venereal diseases was 396.22 against 185.40 last year, showing an increase of more than double. This result is due to the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act, and is in accordance with what was anticipated by Surgeon Reckitt, M.S., in last year's report. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Cannanore, by Surgeon C. QUARRY. The attendance at the periodical examinations fell off quickly when the women understood the compulsory system was abolished. No rules were in existence in consequence of the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Wellington, by Surgeon H. H. BROWN. Attendance at the hospital is optional. It is not known how far disease has increased or decreased among the women owing to the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act. The Contagious Diseases Act should be rigorously enforced. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at St. Thomas' Mount, by Surgeon T. B. A. TUCKEY. Attendance of the prostitutes for examination has not been compulsory, and they do not come to hospital. No measures of control are available. Ten cases presented themselves for treatment.
8 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE It is known that the women still practise prostitution in the neighbourhood of the Mount. No opportunity has been afforded to enable me to state what are the natures of their diseases, but the greater virulence of the disease among the troops is very marked. Venereal diseases prevail to a considerable extent at this station among the prostitutes, yet the number that present themselves voluntarily for treatment is very few. The re-introduc- tion of the "Contagious Diseases" Act, or some form of control over prostitution, is, therefore, urgently called for. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Belgaum, by Surgeon K. C. SANJANA. The arrangement, which has been in force lately, of soldiers pointing out the women who had diseased them, and of these women being offered the option of coming for examination and treatment, if necessary, in the lock hospital, or of clearing out of the cantonment, does not appear to be effective in diminishing the amount of disease, as so few women have been pointed out, and thus an infinitesimal proportion of the total number of prostitutes in cantonment have come under treatment. The only effective arrangement would be a return to the Conta- gious Diseases Act. Extracts from the Annual Medical Report of the Lock Hospital at Secunderabad, by Surgeon-Major E. LEVINGE. Hospital accommodation is excellent and well suited to the requirements of a lock hospital. Venereal diseases show a marked increase during the year under report. Four women were treated in the hospital. These came voluntarily. It is not possible to state how far disease has increased or decreased amongst the women, but disease has certainly assumed a more virulent and intractable type among the European troops.
