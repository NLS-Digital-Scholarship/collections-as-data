THE following are brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1909-10. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Clarkson, I.M.S., was in charge of thedepartment from 1st April 1909 to 28th February 1910 and I from the 1st March last. The following officers served as Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. Bengal and Orissa Circle.( 2 ) to the fact that in the two previous years a large number of unprotected children were vaccinated, the Special Inspector of Vaccination for Orissa having worked in the backward portions of the district during those years. As regards the decrease in Manbnum and Singhbhum, no satisfactory explana- tion has been furnished by the Civil Surgeons. Vaccination in Municipalities. 5. In the Calcutta Municipality 33,985 operations were performed duringthe year, against 82,079 in 1908-09 and 31,155 in 1907-08. The large increase in 1908-09 was due to the epidemic outbreak of small pox in the town. In mufassal municipalities, dispensaries, etc., the number of cases amounted to 129,971, against 142,781 of the previous year. The decrease is due to much less prevalence of small-pox during the year render review. The average work of a vaccinator in mufassal municipalities was 735 against 819, while that of licensed, District Board and all other paid vaccinators was 1,047, 1,866 and 1,166, against 1,022, 1,979 and 1,475, respectively, of the previousyear. Protection afforded to infants. 6. During the year under review, out of 1,611,332, the estimated numberof infants under one year available for vaccina- tion 934,181, that is, 579.75 per thousand were successfully vaccinated, against 566.72 in the previous year. In 24 districts (against 22 of the previous year), viz., Ranchi, Sambalpur, Birbhum, Palamau, Murshidabad, Bhagalpur, Darjeeling, Cuttack, Champaran, Sonthal Parganas, Hazaribagh, Puri, Manbhum, Burdwan, Nadia, Monghyr, Darbhanga, Purnea, Jessore, Midnapore, Gaya, Angul, Saran and 24-Parganas, the protection was over 500 per mille, which is very satisfactory, considering that vaccination is not compulsory in rural areas. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that the protection afforded was 799.98 per mille of the surviving infant population, against 942.30 of the pre- vious year. The high rates of protection of last year was chiefly due to the epidemic outbreak of small-pox in Calcutta and several other towns when a large number of infants were vaccinated. The attention of the Civil Surgeons has as usual been drawn to their responsibility in the matter of infant vaccina- tion in towns where the protection is inadequate. Recess work. 7. During the recess or non-working season of the past year, 276,417operations were performed in connection with small-pox epidemics, against 181,243 in 1908-09. Six-puncture vaccination. 8. The total number of successful primary and revaccination operationsin six-points was 822,512 and 20,061 respectively, against 825,233 and 19,670 respectively of the previous year. Factory and tea-garden vaccina- tion. 9. During the year under review the total number of primary and re- vaccination operations performed in factories and tea-gardens in Bengal was 3,961 and 671 respec- tively, against 2,945 and 1,403 respectively in theprevious year. The ratio of success in primary and re-vaccination cases was95.22 and 63.78 respectively. Cost of and contribution towards vaccination. 10. The total cost of vaccination during the year was Rs. 2,13,695-14-7,against Rs. 2,05,947-12-7 of the previous year. The average cost of each successful case of vacci- nation was one anna and nine pies, against one anna and eight pies of the previous year. The District Boards, Native States, and Cantonments, dispensaries, etc., contributed Rs. 11,371-0-0, Rs. 388-10-11 and Rs. 167-0-10, against Rs. 10,856-13-7, Rs. 388-10-11 and Rs. 189-10-4, respectively, of the previous year.

The diagram facing this page illustrates the death-rates from small- pox in each district, with side by side, the proportion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during: the past seven years. Deaths from small-pox. 12. The total number of deaths from small-pox in the Province duringthe year was 25,582, showing a ratio of .50 per mille of the population, against 40,927 and .80 in

1903( 3 ) 1908-09. The largest number of deaths were recorded in the districts of Midnapore 2,404, Saran 2,031, Patna 2,011, Howrah 1,489, 24-Parganas 1,349, Shahabad 1,327, Gaya 1,290, Calcutta 1,012, Hooghly 965, Palamau 883, Darbhanga 873, Champaran 794, Burdwan 743, Purnea 684, Sonthal Parganas 659, Monghyr 639, Muzaffarpur 626, Balasore 607, Bhagalpur 514 and Hazaribagh 500, while the mortality was lowest in the districts of Dar- jeeling 20, Sambalpur 27 and Khulna 153. Out of 25,582 persons who died of small-pox, 13,580 were reported to have been vaccinated mostly in their child- hood or otherwise protected, 8,273 were unprotected and in 3,729 cases nothing could be ascertained. These figures based on the reports of illiterate chau- kidars are of little value and throw no light as to the efficacy of vaccination in warding off small-pox. Outturn of work at the Animal Vaccination Depôts. 13. In the Animal Vaccination Depôts in Calcutta and Darjeeling 1,879and 223 calves were vaccinated, against, 1,610 and 235, respectively, in the previous year. The quanti- ty of lymph manufactured was 520,114 and 63,210 grains, against 420,945 and 69,073 grains, respectively, in the previous year. Different methods of vaccination. 14. During the year under report. 43,713 primary operations were performed with lymph direct from calves, 932,528 with lanoline lymph and 829,737 by the arm-to- arm method, the corresponding figures for the preceding year being 73,424, 1,058,995 and 804,450 respectively. The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods was 98.46, 98.35, and 99.00, as compared with 99.49, 98.09 and 98.77, respectively, of the previous year. The number of revaccinations under each of these processes of vaccination was 11,486, 146,411 and 12,978 with a success of 66.82, 60.22 and 69.17 per cent. against 8,301, 228,901 and 67,505 with a success of 76.83, 59.59 and 83.41 per cent., respectively, during 1908-09. In Calcutta and in certain parts of the Howrah, Nadia and Jessore dis- tricts 62,607 primary and 14,313 re-vaccination cases were performed with glycerinated calf lymph. The ratio per cent. of success was 97.07 and 47.17, respectively. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Durbar and the Sikkim State. 15. During 1909-10, 355 and 1,415 grains of lanoline vaccine paste weresupplied to the Nepal Darbar and the Sikkim State, against 250 and 1,130 grains, respectively, during the previous year. Inspections. 16. During the past year the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner of theBihar and Chota Nagpur Circle inspected 49,685 cases in 909 villages. Among Civil Surgeons, only six, viz. , the Civil Surgeons of Jessore, Saran, Muzaffarpur, Sonthal Parganas, Puri and Sambalpur, inspected more than 10,000 operations; 7 from 5,000 to 10,000; 15 from 2,000 to 5,000 ; 4 from 1,000 to 2,000 and two only, viz., the Civil Surgeons of Howrah and Bhagalpur, below 1,000. Of the subordinate inspecting staff, 13 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their respective charges, 9 between 40 and 50 per cent., 7 between 20 to 40 per cent. and 4 below 20 per cent. In 12 districts the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the primary operations in their jurisdictions; in 18 districts between 50 and 80 per cent.; and in 4 below 50 per cent. Suitable notice has as usual been taken departmentally of the inadequate amount of inspections performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General remarks. 17. As noted in the previous year's report, further experiments werecarried on with glycerinated lymph manufactured at the Calcutta Central Animal Vaccination Depôt. Regular supplies were sent throughout the working season to the Civil Surgeons of Howrah, Nadia and Jessore. The result reported by them is encouraging, but the liability of the lymph to deterioration owing to heat during transit does not render its general introduction possible at present. The system of realizing the vaccinators' fees through the village panchayets has not been attended with much success. Complaints have been received from many districts, specially Burdwan, Birbhum, Howrah,
( 4 ) 24-Parganas, Bankura, Midnapore, Murshidabad, Shahabad, Sonthal Parganas and Cuttack to the effect that the panchayets rendered little or no help to the vaccinators in realizing their fees. The plea urged was that they had no legal power to enforce payment. The remarks of the Magistrate of Burdwan on the subject are worth quoting :STATISTICAL RETURNS. a

xxi PROVINCIAL STATEMENT Axxii PROVINCIAL STATEMENT BMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 16TH JULY 1910. RESOLUTION( 2 ) total number of deaths registered amounting to only 56,711, or 1.12 per mille, compared with 268,908, or 5.32 per mille, in the preceding year. The season- able rainfall and the better agricultural outturn were responsible for this satis- factory result. Sixty-one registering circles were entirely free from the disease, as against six such areas only during 1908. The use of permanganate of potash for disinfecting wells used for drinking-water is beginning to be appreciated, and in several cases is reported to have had an excellent effect in arresting the progress of the disease. 6. Small-pox and Vaccination.( 3 ) Nineteen Sub-Assistant Surgeons were deputed to malarious districts during the year for the distribution of quinine. Their operations extended over 36 thanas in the districts of Murshidabad, Nadia, Jessore, 24-Parganas, Purnea and Birbhum, and are reported to have been greatly appreciated. This measure will be repeated during the current year. More effective measures were introduced for the sale of quinine in pice-packets, the size of which was also increased, and it is satisfactory to notice that the number of parcels sold increased greatly, 25,514 being disposed of as against 13,307 in the previous year. In addition 4,818 phials, each containing three hundred 3½-grain tablets, were sold. The whole subject has recently been again examined in the light of the recommendations of the Malaria Conference held at Simla in October 1909 ; and although no material departure is contemplated, minor reforms, based upon the experience of other Provinces, will be tried. 11.

OFFICIAL AGENTS In India[Maximum limit, 10 pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT OF VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEARS 1908-09, 1909-10 and 1910-11. THIS report deals with the triennial period 1908-09 to 1910-11. Returns from the Tributary States of Orissa not having been received during the last two years, the figures for these States could not be shewn in this report. The figures of the previous triennial period used in this report for purposes of comparison have been obtained by excluding the figures of the Tributary States from those of the Province. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment. 2. Lieutenant Colonel F. C. Clarkson, I.M.S., was in charge of the Department from 1st April 1908 to 28th February 1910, and I for the rest of the period. In the Bengal and Orissa Circle Captain D. Munro, I.M.S., was in charge from 1st April to 24th November 1908, Lieutenant-Colonel F. R. Ozzard, I.M.S., from 25th November 1908 to 4th August 1909, and I from 5th August 1909 to 28th February 1910 It was without a Deputy Sanitary Commissioner from 1st March 1910 to 31st March 1911. In the Bihar and Chota Nagpur Circle Captain W. C. Ross, I.M.S., was in charge throughout the triennial period. Strength of staff. 3. In Calcutta the average number of inspecting officers and operators was 7 and 31, against 7 and 28 of 1906-08. In the provincial rural areas and mufassal municipalities and dispensaries, etc., the inspecting staff and operators, including apprentices, numbered 140 and 2,326, and 8 and 174, against 137, 2,265, 7 and 170, respectively, during the previous triennial period. General operations. 4. The total number of operations performed in the Province during the past year was 2,035,130, of which 1,929,222 were primary and 105,908 revaccination cases, against 2 053,773 (with 1,868,585 primary cases and 185,188 revaccina- tions) during 1909-10, and 2,019,531 with 1,810,213 primary cases and 209,318 revaccinations during 1908-09. The average of the triennial period under review was 2,036,145 with 1,869,340 primary cases and 166,805 revaccinations against 1,897,867, 1,776,002, and 121,865 of the previous triennial period 1905-06 to 1907-08. There was an average increase of 138,278 cases, of which 93,338 were in primary vaccination and 44,940 in revaccination. This is satisfactory, showing that steady progress in vaccination is being main- tained. The ratio of success under the two different heads( 2 ) The principal decrease occurred in Palamau (12,824), Birbhum (8,715), Midnapore (7,464), Gaya (6,988), Shahabad (6,872), Burdwan (6,804), Patna (6,107), Darjeeling (5,639), Jessore (5,589), and Howrah (5,225). In Balasore the increase is attributed to (a) the good health of the district, (b) absence of famine and flood, (c) decrease in the prices of food-grains which enabled the poor to pay the vaccination fees, and (d) chiefly to the prolonged tour of the Civil Surgeon on account of the neglected condition of vaccination in the district. As regards Ranchi no explanation of the increase has been furnished by the Civil Surgeon. In Saran it is said to be due to an increase in the number of vaccinators, while in Singhbhum it is owing to operations having been carried on in larger areas than those taken up in the previous years. The Civil Surgeon of Hazaribagh attributes the increase to the fact that larger elakas were given to the vaccinators by reducing their number, which encour- aged them to work harder in the hope of getting more fees. In Sambalpur the vaccinators attended to their work more regularly, there being less illness among them than in the previous year, and hence the increase, while in Monghyr it is attributed to the increased activity of the staff. The decrease in vaccination in the districts named above is due to much less prevalence of small-pox in the past year than in the previous one. The explanation may be considered satisfactory, as there is no doubt that the presence or absence of an epidemic outbreak of small-pox in a district affects the total number of operations performed in it. Protection afforded to infants. 5. During the past year 1910-11) out of 1,676,650, the estimated number of infants under one year available for vaccination (1,006.829), that is 600.50 per thousand, were successfully vaccinated against 534.54 during 1907-08, which was the last year of the previous triennial period. In two districts, viz., Ranchi and Sambalpore, the number of recorded protected infants exceeds the available population. This is evidently due to the inclusion of some children above one year of age in the returns by miscalculation of age on the part of illiterate vaccinators. Making due allowance for inaccuracies of this kind, it may be stated generally that there is a steady increase in infant vaccination from year to year. In 24 districts (against 19 of 1907-08, the last year of the previous trien- nial period), viz., Ranchi, Sambalpore, Palamau, Cuttack, Hazaribagh, Murshidabad, Manbhum, Singhbhum, Balasore, Bhagalpur, Sonthal Parganas, Muzaffarpur, Nadia, Darjeeling, Monghyr, Purnea, Saran, Champaran, Angul, Darbhanga, Gaya, Midnapore, Burdwan and Bankura, the protection was over 500 per mille, while the lowest rate recorded, viz., in the district of Shahabad, is about 300 per thousand against 236 in Bankura in 1907-08. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII attached to the report. It will be seen that 773.68 per mille of the surviving infant population was protected during the past year, against 799.98 during 1909-10 and 942.30 during the year before. The attention of Civil Surgeons has as usual been drawn to their responsibility in the matter of infant vaccination in towns, wherever the protection is inadequate. Recess-work. 6. During the recess or non-working season of 1910-11, 141,142 opera- tions were performed in connection with small-pox epidemics and the up-keep of lymph for emergen- cies, against 276,417 in 1909-10 and 181,243 in 1908-09. The average of the triennial period under review was 193,765, against 151,349 of 1906-08. The decrease in the number of operations during the recess season of the past year is due to much less prevalence of small-pox as compared with that of previous years. Six-puncture vaccination. 7. During the past year 842,895 successful primary operations were performed in six points, against 822,512 in 1909-10 and 825,233 in 1908-09. The number of re- vaccinations was 12,305, against 20,061 in 1909-10 and 19,670 in 1908-09. The average of the triennial period in primary vaccination and revaccination was 830,213 and 17,345, against 773,687 and 9,140 of the previous epoch. Factory and Tea Garden vac- cination. 8. During 1910-11 the total number of primary and revaccination oper- ations performed in factories and tea gardens in Bengal was 3,602 and 260, against 3,961 and 671, respectively, in 1909-10 and 2,945 and 1,403 in 1908-09. The ratio of success in primary and revaccination cases was 97.14

( 3 ) and 81.15, against 95.22 and 63.78, respectively, during 1909-10 and 98.91 and 42.05 during the year before. Cost of, and contribution to- wards, vaccination. 9. The total average cost of vaccination in Bengal for the triennial period under review was Rs. 2,03,526-15, against Rs. 1,70,555-9-8 of 1906-08, the cost of each suc- cessful vaccination being 1 anna 8 pies, against 1 anna 6 pies of 1906-08. A large portion of the increased cost is accounted for by the fact that in the statement for the period under review the cost of vaccination in the Calcutta Municipality has been shown for the entire period, whereas in the previous triennial report the cost on account of vaccination for this city for two years (viz., 1905-06 and 1906-07) could not be shown, the figures not being available. Out of the average cost of vaccination as shown above Rs. 10,560 were contributed by District Boards, Rs. 355 by Native States, and Rs. 198 from other sources, the corresponding figures for the preceding triennial period being Rs. 7,943, Rs. 198, and Rs. 212, respectively. Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox and degree of protection afforded. 10. The diagram facing this page illustrates the death-rates from small- pox in each district with side by side the pro- portion of population protected against the disease by vaccination during the past seven years. Deaths from small-pox. 11. During the past year the total number of deaths from small-pox in the Province was 6,174 only, against 25,582 of 1909-10 and 40,927 of 1908-09, the ratio of deaths per 1,000 of the population being .11, against .50 and .80, respectively, during the two preceding years. The past year's rate of mortality is the lowest recorded since 1888-89. The largest number of deaths was recorded in the districts of Purnea (735), Bankura (707), Bhagalpur (559), Patna (494), Balasore (442) and Midnapore (372) while the mortality was lowest in the districts of Khulna (7), Puri (8), Cuttack (16), Nadia and Hazaribagh (17) each, and Darjeeling (18).* Out of 6,174 persons who died of small-pox, 3,133 were reported to have been vaccinated or otherwise protected, 1,955 were unprotected, and in 1,086 cases nothing could be ascertained. As already stated in previous reports these figures are of no value, being utterly untrustworthy. Animal vaccination depôts. 12. The Animal Vaccination Depôt at Darjeeling was abolished with effect from the 1st January last. Prior to its aboli- tion the number of calves vaccinated in it was 108 and the quantity of lymph manufactured was 30,444 grains, against 223 calves and 63,210 grains of lymph during 1909-10, and 235 calves and 69,073 grains of lymph during 1908-09. The number of calves vaccinated in the Calcutta Animal Vaccination Depôt during the past year was 2,194, and the quantity of lymph manufactured was 608,916, against 1,879 calves and 520,114 grains of lymph during 1909-10, and 1,610 calves and 420,943 grains of lymph during 1908-09. Different methods of vaccination. 13. During the past year 39,076 primary operations were performed with lymph taken direct from the calf, 1,261,364 with lanoline lymph, and 606,325 by arm-to-arm method, against 43,713, 932,528 and 829,737, respectively, during the preceding year and 73,424, 996,289 and 740,500 in the year before (1908-09). The ratio per cent. of success under each of these methods of vaccination was 98.01, 98.62 and 99.28, respectively, against 98.46, 98.35 and 99.00 during 1909-10 and 99.49, 98.31 and 99.12 during 1908-09 The number of revaccinations under each of these processes of vaccination was 8,153, 87,856 and 4,458 with a success of 85.07, 58.81 and 60.25 per cent., respectively, against 11,486, 146,411 and 12,974 with a success of 66.82, 60.22 and 69.17 per cent. during 1909-10, and 8,301, 184,026 and 16,991 with a success of 76.83, 53.57 and 79.28 during the year before. Supply of lymph to the Nepal Durbar. 14. During 1910-11, seven hundred and forty grains of lymph were supplied to the Nepal Durbar from the Animal Vaccination Depôts, and 1,590 grains to the Sikkim State. Inspections. 15. Captain W. C. Ross, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commissioner, Bihar and Chota Nagpur Circle, made systematic tours every winter inspecting vaccination in outlying * The very satisfactory result in the case of Puri and Cuttack is no doubt due to the adoption of special measures for pushing on vaccination in Orissa as detailed in paragraph 16(g) of the last triennial report. *
( 4 ) parts of districts in Bihar and Chota Nagpur. The defects brought to notice by him were promptly remedied which resulted in much improvement in vaccination. During the past year he inspected 60,046 cases in 1,905 villages. The percentage of successful operations to total number of cases inspected by him was 94.67. I also inspected over 7,201 vaccinations in the towns of Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Purnea, Purulia, Gaya, Chapra and Arrah and also in about 180 villages in the Patna, Gaya, Shahabad and Manbhum districts. Among Civil Surgeons, 8, viz., the Civil Surgeons of Midnapore, Saran, Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Sonthal Parganas, Puri and Singh- bhum inspected over 10,000 operations each, 5 between 5,000 and 10,000, 14 between 2,000 and 5,000, 6 between 1,000 and 2,000, and 1 only less than 1,000. The percentage of success in primary and revaccination cases inspected by them was 97.87 and 61.73, respectively. Of the subordinate inspecting staff 12 District Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 50 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their respective charges, 12 between 40 and 50, and 9 between 20 and 40 per cent. In 18 districts the Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination inspected more than 80 per cent. of the primary operations performed in their jurisdictions, in 14 districts between 50 and 80 per cent., and in 2 only below 50 per cent. The percentage of success reported by the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination was 98.72 and 98.72 in primary cases and 54.11 and 58.53 in revaccination, the success reported by vaccinators in the returns being 98.76 and 59.35, respectively, under the above heads. Suitable notice has as usual been taken departmentally of the inade- quate inspections performed by the subordinate inspecting staff. General remarks. 16. Two important changes were brought into effect during the past year, viz., (1) the introduction of the system of vaccination from prepared lymph in Chota Nagpur in place of arm-to-arm vaccination which was in vogue, and (2) the abolition of the Darjeeling Animal Vaccination Depôt. This depôt was an expensive institution and it was unnecessary to maintain it, since the introduction of the system of preserving lymph in a cold storage chamber. The Calcutta depôt has been able to maintain a reserve of six months' supply for the Province and is thus able to meet the entire demand for lymph. W. W.

Cholera.( 3 ) returned a rate of 23.77 only during the year under review. Among towns, Sahibganj in the Sonthal Parganas was again the worst sufferer, but with a decreased mortality of 35.06 per mille, as again 40.75 per mille in 1909. On the basis of the figures for the last six years, Bihar and Chota Nagpur are markedly more feverish than either Bengal or Orissa, and the comparative rates of mortality, in each during 1910 are repro- duced in the margin. Anti-malarial measures were carried on in North Barrackpore, (mainly at the cost of Government), and in Cossipore-Chitpur, Manicktolla, Garden Reach, Titaghar, Panihati, Hazaribagh and Daltonganj, at the expense of the local Municipalities. Death-rate from fever per mille. Bihar ... ... 24.02 Chota Nagpur ... ... 20.24 Bengal... ... 17.82 Orissa ... ... 12.22 10. A Provincial Malaria Committee was appointed during the year with a view to supervising the continuous investigation of the question of the prevalence of malaria, and an executive staff consisting of a Special Deputy Sanitary Cammissioner and an Assistant Surgeon was placed at its disposal. It is hoped that more systematic methods of work will eventually result in the discovery of some means of dealing with this scourge, although the financial difficulty of executing works of drainage, etc., on an extensive scale has not yet been solved. The successful experiment of appointing itinerant Sub-Assistant Surgeons to specially malarious districts was continued and extended, 23 Sub-Assistant Surgeons being deputed, as against 19 in 1909, to work in seven districts as compared with six in 1909. In Purnea the experiment was tried, with some success, of a regular free issue of quinine to Government servants in receipt of pay of Rs. 10 per mensem and less, but it is significant that the districts of Shahabad, Darjeeling and Purnea, in which the highest mortality from malaria was recorded, show a comparatively small consumption of this drug. 11. Dysentery and diarrh( 4 ) Sanitary Board, it appears that (exclusive of Calcutta) there are at present in the Province 19 municipalities possessing water-works on a more or less elaborate scale, which serve a population of rather over half a million, and the total capital cost of which, up to the 31st December 1910, was approximately Rs. 48 lakhs. Although much still remains to be done in this direction, it is obvious that a substantial beginning has been made towards the proper equip- ment of the towns in Bengal in this respect, the more so when it is remembered that the majority of these installations were constructed since the commencement of the century. It is estimated, moreover, that in two years the quantity of filtered water supplied to the inhabitants of municipalities in Bengal will be increased by about 75 per cent. Thirteen drainage schemes were under examination during the year at Bhagalpur, Graya, Sahibganj, Azimganj, Kushtia, Motihari, Ranchi, North. Barrackpore, Bhadreswar, Asansol, Manicktolla, Chapra and Purulia, while drainage projects at Howrah, Puri, Arrah, Daltonganj, Bhatpara, Baranagore, Budge-Budge, Basirhat, Baraset and Baruipur were under construction. In four cases Hazaribagh, Berhampore, Burdwan and Monghyr tenders have been called for. From the figures furnished it appears that outside Calcutta) 20 towns are provided with drainage works of varying degrees of completeness, upon which a capital expenditure of about Rs. 16¼ lakhs has been incurred, up to the 31st December 1910. Many of these are still in progress, but the record is by no means insignificant, and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council notices with pleasure the report of the Sanitary Board that greater progress has been achieved, during the year under review, in the preparation of schemes of water supply and drainage (particularly the former) than was ever the case before in the annals of the Board. A specially liberal provision has been made during the current year for grants-in-aid to these projects, and it behoves local bodies to bestir themselves to establish a claim to assistance, by demons- trating that they are willing, on their part, to contribute towards the improve- ment of the areas in their charge. 16. The thanks of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council are due to Major Clemesha and to the Sanitary Board for their energetic administration of the Department. The work of Captain Ross, I.M.S., Deputy Sanitary Commis- sioner, Bihar and Chota Nagpur, is also particularly commended. By order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, H.

RESOLUTION( 2 ) 5. Cholera.( 3 ) the result of his investigations leads to the conclusion that little permanent benefit is likely to accrue in Bengal by any attempt to eradicate mosquitoes by destroying larvæ. Until fuller information as to the causes underlying the prevalence of malaria, in what is called the hyper-endemic area, which consists of part of Murshidabad and Jessore, is obtained, the only method of procedure which seems to hold out hopes of success is to reduce the infection rate by the use of quinine. Twenty-four Sub-Assistant Surgeons were deputed for distributing quinine gratuitously. In Jessore, quinine hydrochloride in &quot; treatments &quot; was exclusively used, and is said to have been very efficacious and much appre- ciated by the people. The sale of quinine was the largest in the districts of Burdwan, Khulna, Nadia, Murshidabad and Birbhum, 11. Dysentery and Diarrh( 4 ) 17. A step in a new direction has been taken by the proposal to create a special Public Works Division for the purpose of investigating drainage conditions. The prevailing ignorance of the data governing the water-logged condition of various districts forbids the formation of well-considered drainage schemes and, owing to the absence of systematic observations from the records of the past, the exact wants of different localities are unknown. It is a common and oft-repeated cry in Bengal that the cause of malaria is largely due to defective drainage. What is needed is a systematic investigation by an expert establishment, which should be able to submit a definite and authoritative report regarding the localities in which the drainage is defective, stating the extent and nature of the defects, and the possible remedies and their approximate cost. This information will now be collected by the special officer appointed for this purpose, who will first investigate the conditions near the Bhairab river in Jessore. 18. Since the close of the year under report, it has been decided to organize a sanitary service for the province, with Health Officers in charge of the larger municipal towns and properly trained and qualified Sanitary Inspectors for other towns and rural areas. The details of the scheme are now being worked out and the course of training for the inspectors drawn up, as the first essential is the supply of properly trained men. The organization of the service in municipal towns will first be taken up, as they are compact and more easily managed areas, but it is hoped, within a reasonable time, to extend the scheme to the rural areas also.

Officer in charge of the Department.2 vaccination had died out, revaccinated, and to the practical help given generally by the executive authorities. In the districts of Dacca, Chittagong, Mymen- singh and Tippera, the increase was due to outbreaks of small-pox necessitat- ing a large number of persons being vaccinated. As regards the decrease, the Civil Surgeon of Bakarganj attributes it to the aversion of the Ferazi Muhammadans to vaccination, and to the difficulty in getting good vaccinators, owing to the trouble in realizing the vaccinators' fees and to the bad behaviour of the people. In Faridpur, the decrease is reported to be due partly to the fact that a large number of Ferazi Muhammadans had been vaccinated during the previous year, leaving a fewer number of persons unprotected during the year, and also partly to prevalence of malarial fever during the working season. In Khulna, it was due to illness among the vaccinators, and also to the fact that a large number of unprotect- ed persons had been vaccinated during 1911-12, leaving fewer subjects for vaccination during the past year. Malaria is reported to have retarded vacci- nation in Bankura and Murshidabad ; the Civil Surgeon of the latter district makes the inspecting staff also responsible for the decrease. In Rajshahi, the decrease was due partly to absence of small-pox in epidemic form, and partly to the opposition of the Ferazi Muhammadans. The Civil Surgeon of Pabna attributes the decrease to greater prevalence of malarial fever, which rendered vaccination in most of the thanas extremely difficult, while in Malda it is reported to be due to the smaller number of surviving infants available for vaccination. 5.

xv PROVINCIAL STATEMENT Axvi PROVINCIAL STATEMENT BMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. DACCA, THE 12th JULY 1913. RESOLUTION2 4. Chief diseases.3 districts of Jessore, Nadia and Murshidabad, the latter in Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Dacca and Faridpur. Several Sub-Assistant Surgeons were employed in distributing quinine gratis in several districts during the fever season. There was a large increase in the sale of quinine by the Jail Department. Arrangements have now been made by which this department will prepare the quinine &quot; treatments &quot; which have hitherto been obtained from a firm in England. The Malaria Committee devoted itself during the year primarily to a con- sideration of the measures that should be taken to render quinine more popu- lar and to bring it more prominently to the notice of the general public. Detailed arrangements have been made and they will shortly be put into force. 6. Verification of vital statistics.4 The progress of work in the Sanitary Engineer's office reflects great credit on Mr. Williams and his staff. It is evident, however, that the exist- ing engineering staff is quite inadequate for the work of the department. The appointment of a second Assistant Sanitary Engineer has been sanctioned and will shortly be filled. The further strengthening of the staff is now under the consideration of Government. The question of the position and duties of the Sanitary Board and of the Sanitary Engineer and the relationship between them is also under examination. 10.

In India[Maximum limit, 4 pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEARS 1911-12, 1912-13 AND 1913-14. 1. THIS report deals' with vaccination in the reconstituted Presidency of Bengal for the triennial period 1911-12 to 1913-14. 2. Officer in charge of the Department.2 year. This explanation must be accepted with reservation, as I doubt also the accuracy of the figures of the Dacca district which was the worst sufferer from small-pox during 1913. In Midnapore the decrease is said to be due to the adults of the district having been protected in previous years, less subjects being thus left for vaccination. No satisfactory explanation of the decrease in Tippera has been furnished, but I am afraid the figures cannot be relied on for accuracy. 5. Protection afforded to infants.Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox and degree of protection afforded 19073 The largest number of deaths were recorded in the districts of Dacca (2,079), Chittagong (1,469), Mymensingh (1,429), Tippera (437), Midnapore (401), Dinajpur (360), Calcutta (316), Noakhali (309), Faridpur (217), Bakarganj (188), 24-Parganas (134), Hooghly (131) and Howrah (131), while the districts of Bogra, Khulna and Darjeeling show only 5,07, and 9 deaths respectively. It will be seen that a very large majority, 83.86 per cent. of the deaths occurred in the Eastern Bengal districts, where recent inspection by the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner revealed great laxity and want of management and supervision of vaccination by the subordinate staff. I have already brought this to the notice of Government in a separate com- munication with a view to remedial measures being adopted. 12. Animal Vaccine Depot.4 systematic inspection of vaccination by the superior officers of the Department, the want of which was so keenly felt by myself and my predecessors. Already many abuses practised by the vaccinators and the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination have been brought to light and prompt measures are being taken to remedy these. In some of the Eastern Bengal districts, specially Bakarganj, inaccurate figures have been for years furnished to swell the number of vaccinations in the returns, whereas on close inspection it appears that actually very little work was done. This is a serious matter and it is no wonder that mortality from small-pox has gone on increasing in these districts during the past five years. It is urgently necessary to take strong measures to put a stop to the abuses referred to. I have already in a separate communication asked for Government sanction to the entertain- ment of two special Supervising Officers who will help the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner in carrying out the necessary reforms. 16.

xv PROVINCIAL STATEMENT Axvi PROVINCIAL STATEMENT B.GENERAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 13TH AUGUST 1914. RESOLUTION2 4. Verification of vital statistics.3 unreliable and that even those now furnished are very doubtful. The figures for Tippera and Dacca are also suspected to be unreliable. The Governor in Council notices with regret that the percentage of infants vaccinated fell from 48 in 1912-13 to 46 in 1913-14. Malda now heads the list with the excellent percentage of 86 and Bakarganj stands last with the almost incredibly low figure of 8.3. His Excellency in Council trusts that in future greater attention will be paid to the vaccination of infants. The six-puncture system of vaccination was introduced into many districts in Eastern Bengal during 1912-13, but it was not adopted in every district till 1913-14. In that year the number of infant vaccinations performed under this system was more than double that of the year before, while the number of re-vaccinations was 47,899 against 7,563 and 3,301 during the two preceding years. The system of anti-septic vaccination was introduced into the Eastern Bengal districts during 1913-14 with fairly satisfactory results. The average annual cost of vaccination was Rs. 1,79,381 as compared with Rs. 1,62,068 during the years 1908-09 to 1910-11. The increase in the number of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners has rendered possible a more thorough inspection of vaccination. Many abuses have already been brought to light, especially in the Dacca Circle, where the Sanitary Commissioner has recently recommended the appointment of two special supervising officers to assist the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner. This proposal is under the consideration of Government. 7. Sanitary improvements.4 made since the close of the year. The Governor in Council hopes that the improvement in the progress of works under construction will continue, and that municipalities will not be slow to make full use of the facilities that are now offered for the preparation and carrying out of sanitary schemes. No reasonable assistance in the shape of grants will be refused. 10. Staff.ANNUAL STATISTICAL RETURNS AND SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1914-15. BY DR. C. A.

Published by the Bengal Secretariat Book Depôt, Writers' Buildings, Calcutta. OFFICIAL AGENTS. In India[Maximum limit 4 pages]. SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1914-15. The following are brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1914-15. 2. Officer in charge of the Department.2 Eastern Bengal again formed a part of old Bengal, and also with the appointment of additional Deputy Sanitary Commissioners. I believe and recent enquires also show, that the large vaccination figures that were returned previously, were mostly fictitious.

Even here, there was a sudden drop in the figures from 118,937 in 1912-13 to 47,920 in 1913-14, this being about normal. Recent inspections in the district of Tippera by the Deputy Sanitary Com- missioner and in Midnapore by the Civil Surgeon and myself show that vaccination affairs here are almost as bad as it was in Bakarganj. The large reduction in Mymensingh, Faridpur, Dacca, Noakhali and Chittagong is chiefly due to the fact that the disclosures in Bakarganj and Tippera have struck terror into the hearts of the subordinate vaccination staff who are beginning to return what seem to be correct figures. Enquiries are still being made to find out the extent to which the practice of falsifying returns obtains in the other Eastern Bengal districts and the offenders whenever detected are being severely dealt with. The decrease noticed in the case of Rangpur, Jessore and a few other districts is reported to be due to a large extent to the severe prevalence of malarial fever that not only disabled a large number of vaccinators but also greatly hampered the progress of work among a debilitated people. The fall in the prices of jute also somewhat interfered with vaccination in the jute-growing districts. To remedy the evils noted above and improve matters in the Eastern Bengal districts, an energetic officer with great experience in this particular kind of work has been specially appointed towards the close of the year He will for the present tour in Barisal and one or two other districts, carefully check the returns submitted by the vaccinators, report all deficiencies on their part as well as on that of the subordinate inspecting staff, and will also tactfully try to overcome all opposition to vaccination and to the payment of the vaccinators' fees. Civil Surgeons have also been requested to scrutinise all vaccination returns most carefully before submitting them to this office, and whenever possible to verify the entries in the course of their inspec- tion tours. Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of vaccination also have been ordered to look more to the quality than to the quantity of work performed, and to inspect the work of each vaccinator at least twice during the season. Much good is expected from these measures, especially in the Dacca and Chittagong Divisions, where the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner is able to devote much of his time to the question of vaccination. In the other divisions, owing to the war, the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners have either been entirely withdrawn or have been given other duties to perform ; and it is feared that the work of vaccination will suffer in consequence. The number of revaccinations during the year was unusually large owing to the severe prevalence of smallpox in many parts of the Presi- dency. Calcutta stands first in this respect with 82,894 revaccinations and is followed by 24-Parganas with 81,543, Midnapore with 79,747 and Mymensingh with 29,678. In this connection, it may be noted that in the district of 24-Parganas 58,534 revaccinations and 13,459 primary operations
Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox and degree of protection afforded, 19083 were performed within the last two months of the season, and this was solely due to the District Board's paying a fee of half-anna for each operation. This shows that a large amount of work can be done if the paid system is introduced and vaccination made free. The Civil Surgeons of Midnapore, 24-Parganas, Murshidabad, Khulna, Dinajpur, Dacca, Barisal, Noakhali and Tippera advocate the introduction of the free vaccination system in their respective districts. The ratio of success in primary operations in (1) rural areas, and (2) muni- cipalities were 97.66 and 97.74 against 98.78 and 98.30 during the preceding year, while those in the case of revaccination were 65.22 and 55.40 against 66.00 and 47.49, respectively. 5. Vaccination in Municipalities.4 Animal Vaccination Depôt. 13. Altogether 2,454 against 2,212 calves were vaccinated in the Animal Vaccine Depôt during the year and the quantity of lymph manufactured was 772.587 against 744,054 grains. From the commencement of the last vaccination season the whole Presidency, as it now stands, was supplied with lymph from the Calcutta Animal Vaccine Depôt, and no lymph from the Shillong Depôt was required. Much difficulty was experienced during the year owing to the non-receipt of glass tubes and lanoline from England on account of the war. Out of 600 gross of tubes ordered only 245 gross were received. By collecting old tubes from Civil Surgeons, however, the despatch of lymph is being maintained. But if this state of things continues the work is likely to suffer. 14. Different methods of Vaccination.STATISTICAL RETURNS.

xv PROVINCIAL STATEMENT A.xvi PROVINCIAL STATEMENT BGENERAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 20TH SEPTEMBER 1915. RESOLUTION2 total mortality as against 72 per cent. in the previous year was registered under this head. The lowest rates were as usual returned by the urban areas where the death-rate continues to decline. Anti-malarial measures were carried out in a few towns, and quinine was freely distributed in a number of districts by Sub-Assistant Surgeons from the middle of August. Unfortunately 18 of the 24 Sub-Assistant Surgeons employed on the work were early withdrawn for military duty and 12 new men were appointed only after considerable delay. The measures were, however, extended till the end of February, one month beyond the usual period. It is gratifying to observe that the efforts of the Malaria Committee to popularise quinine appear to be meeting with success, and there was a considerable demand for quinine in the &quot; treatment &quot; form in which it is now sold. The sale of quinine in this form has nearly doubled since August 1913. Quinine was distributed free to school children in the Hooghly district through the agency of the Eduction Department, and some District Boards spent considerable sums in the purchase of quinine for free distribution. The necessity for administering adequate doses of quinine to patients attending dispensaries was brought to the notice of District Boards and Municipalities, and assistance was given to a few of the poorer municipalities to enable them to purchase the requisite amount of quinine. Besides considering methods for increasing the use of quinine, the Malaria Committee enquired into the malarious nature of Manikganj, and discussed the value of sub-soil drainage as an anti-malarial measure and the danger arising from borrow-pits in proximity to dwelling-houses. The Committee decided that no benefit would accrue from jungle-cutting experiments for which the Indian Research Fund had made a grant of Rs. 50,000. It, therefore, put forward a proposal that this grant should be utilised in carrying out two experimental schemes of sub-soil drainage drawn up by Dr. Bentley. This proposal did not, however, meet with the approval of the Government of India and the grant for experimental jungle-cutting was accordingly withdrawn. The Governor in Council is disappointed to find that the Malaria Committee hold only three meetings during 1914, but he is glad to learn that the efforts of the Committee to popularise quinine are meeting with success. The first step towards the elimination of malaria is the extension of the use of quinine both as a prophylactic and as a curative medicine. Much good will no doubt result from measures for the improve- ment of drainage and cultivation, but these by themselves will not prevent the spread of malaria. 5. Other diseases.3 7.

Two of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Major Fry were re- called to military duty towards the close of the year, while a third Deputy Sanitary Commissioner was placed in charge of the duties of the Civil Surgeon of Jalpaiguri in addition to his own. The work of the Department has thus been considerably curtailed.

[Maximum limit 4 pages.] SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION FOR THE YEAR 1915-16. The following are brief notes on Vaccination for the year 1915-16. 2. Officer in charge of the Department.2 Darjeeling the good result was due to greater prevalence of small-pox. No explanation of the increase has been furnished by the Civil Surgeon of Rajshahi, but it appears that it was due to a large number of revaccinations performed during the recess in connection with the suppression of sporadic cases of small-pox in several thanas of the district. As regards decrease, it was very marked in Calcutta (80,898), Midnapore (32,198), Chittagong (20,686), Noakhali (12,655), Hooghly including Serampore (4,417), 24-Parganas including the suburbs (4,150) and Rangpur (3,817). In Calcutta it amounted to 9,221 in primary operations and 71,677 in re- vaccinations, owing to less severe prevalence of small-pox during the year under report, the number of deaths from this disease being 731 against 2,743 during 1914-15. The decrease in Chittagong is said to be due to the fact that four circles in the district remained vacant owing to want of vaccinators and seven vaccinators worked only for two or three months during the working season. The large number of vaccinations performed during the pre- vious two years when small-pox prevailed severely over the greater part of the district also contributed to this unsatisfactory result. In Noakhali the large falling off was in revaccination, and this was due to the absence of any outbreak of small-pox in the district during the year. The decrease in Hooghly is accounted for by the absence of small-pox in epidemic form during the year under report, while that in Rangpur was due to the abnormal preva- lence of malarial fever and cholera in the Nilphamari subdivision of the district during the first three months of the working season. The Civil Surgeon of Midnapore writes that the decrease in vaccination in his district was due to the fact that during the previous year small-pox prevailed epide- mically in many places and people came forwared voluntarily to get themselves vaccinated and more vaccinators had to be employed to carry on the increased work, and moreover strict supervision was exercised during the current year to get correct figures and false entries are believed therefore to be now much fewer than formerly. 5. Vaccination in Municipalities.Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox and degree of protection afforded, 19093 11. Diagram illustrating death-rates from Small-pox and degree of protection afforded.4 hundred and twenty-eight primary and 1,147 revaccination operations were performed by the vaccinators attached to this special campaign against 20,232 primary and 883 revaccinations during the previous year by licensed vaccinators. The working of the special staff was fairly satisfactory, and Dr. M. E. Sufi who was in charge of the operations reports that Special Inspector of Vaccination Haji Mohomed Jan Khan has accomplished a work the like of which has never been done before in this district and one which would have been impossible to the staff previously employed. The Special Inspector has thus fully justified his appointment. In 24-Parganas 16 vaccinators on Rs. 10 each. 32 on Rs. 7 each and 16 on Rs. 5 each were appointed by the District Board to carry on free vaccination in the rural areas of the district. The District Board also paid a capitation fee of ½ anna per vaccination to these men. This system is similar to that proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Clemesha to Government. The Civil Surgeon of 24-Parganas reports that this method has worked satisfactorily and the people gladly welcomed the opportunity of free vaccination and most of the increase of 14,507 cases in primary vaccination must be ascribed to this cause. The objection to vaccination was greatly reduced among the poorer classes, from their inability to pay the fees, and hence there was an unprecedented increase in the number of vaccinated infants. 17.

CALCUTTA, THE 22ND AUGUST 1916. RESOLUTION2 floods caused distress in some parts of East Bengal. Taking the pro- vince as a whole, however, the people suffered less from abnormally short or heavy rainfall than from an irregular distribution, which caused the agricultural outturn to be below the average in the majority of districts. 5. Despite the enhanced general mortality, there was a small but gratifying reduction in infantile mortality, the ratio of deaths to births falling- from 22.14 to 21.89 per cent. In only five districts did the percentage exceed 25 ; but higher rates continued to prevail in urban areas, varying from 26 per cent. in Bhadreswar to as much as 64 per cent. in Maniktalla. There was a slight increase in the case of Calcutta, which, however, with a percent- age of under 29 per cent., does not compare unfavourably with the majority of the towns. 6. Notwithstanding the attention paid to the verification of vital statis- tics, and the measures taken to ensure accuracy, it is feared that a consider- able allowance must still be made for omissions. Enquiries made by the vaccination staff in the case of over 100,000 births and 50,000 deaths led to- the discovery of omissions representing approximately 2 per cent. in the case of the former and 2'5 per cent. in the case of the latter. Further special enquiries revealed a more serious degree of error in individual districts, and also showed that, in every district but one in which investigation was made, the neglect to register births was far more extensive than the failure to record deaths. The Governor in Council has entrusted, as an experimental measure, the presidents of panchayats in selected localities with the duty of recording births and deaths in rural areas, and the experiment is reported to have been successful. 7. Fever.3 had results little less disastrous, and there seems little doubt that, as the Sanitary Commissioner points out, &quot; outbreaks of cholera must be counted upon as annual events as long as the majority of sources of water-supply remain subject to gross contamination as they do at present.&quot; 10. The record of cholera epidemics in towns further emphasizes the need of a pure water-supply and demonstrates the protection afforded to those which have installed waterworks. In the town of Berhampore a serious epidemic broke out, but special investigation showed that not a single case occurred in any house having a connection with the pipe-water supply and that the disease was confined to those who persisted in drinking unfiltered water brought from the river. Statistics of the Hooghly-Chinsura Municipality also show that, during the nine years ending in 1913, the annual mortality from cholera averaged 5.65 per mille, but that in 1914, when water- works were started and a filtered water-supply was given for part of the year, the death-rate was reduced to 2.28 per mille, and that during 1915, when the scheme was in full operation, the death-rate fell to under 1 per mille. 11. Small-pox and Vaccination.4 spread formation of Union Committees and the free exercise of their powers of local taxation that the Governor in Council sees the best prospect of material improvement in village sanitation. At the same time, he agrees with the Sanitary Commissioner that, although it is probable that permanent results can only be achieved in this way, much immediate improvement, which will also have an educative value, can be attained through the personal interest and initiative of district officials. 16. Owing to financial conditions, there was an inevitable decrease in the expenditure on sanitary engineering works in the Presidency during the year 1915. The total amounted to Rs. 7,30,390, as against Rs. 9,64,571 during the previous year, the greater part of the expenditure being, as before, devoted to water-supply. No waterworks scheme was actually completed, but those of Bankura and Chittagong were brought near to completion. Drainage schemes were completed at Kurseong, Baruipur and Kushtia, and progress was also made with schemes for Burdwan, Katwa and Bhadreswar. The Governor in Council keenly regrets the inevitable check to the progress of sanitary engineering works which is caused by the present financial situa- tion. He has been obliged to husband the provincial resources carefully and scrupulously, and the result is that, except in cases of the greatest urgency, no grant or loan can be made at present by Government towards new works. At the same time the rise in the prices of materials, especially iron-work and machinery, has rendered it necessary to postpone schemes which, but for the war, would in all probability have been initiated or under construction. 17.

In India[Maximum limit, 4 pages.] TRIENNIAL REPORT ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEARS 1914-15, 1915-16 and 1916-17. 1. This report deals with the triennial period 1914-15 to 1916-17. 2. Officer in charge of the department.2 average, primary vaccinations showing a falling off of 475,206 which was to some extent counterbalanced by an increase of 169.995 in re-vaccination cases. The decrease in the total number of operations reported is chiefly due to the stricter supervision exercised now-a-days by Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination over the work of the vaccinators, and by Deputy Sanitary Commissioners over the work of both, the effect being to check the temptation to submit false figures. The growing difficulty experienced by licensed vaccinators in realising their prescribed fee has also got something to do with the decrease of vaccinations. Many vaccinators complain that they cannot obtain payment of their dues and unfortunately Magistrates and Panchayets are almost powerless to assist them in the absence of any enactment legalising these fees. The rate of success under the two different headsDiagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox during the year 1916-17 and degree of protection afforded 19103 of this Presidency, confirm this view and proves that a very large proportion of the child-population is entirely unprotected. This state of things constitutes a grave danger to the Province as small-pox is a disease which specially attacks children under five years of age ; and epidemics of small-pox are bound in these circumstances to occur from time to time in district after district. Having regard to these facts and in view of the prevalence of small-pox since the close of the year in more or less severe form in parts of Burdwan, Hooghly, Midnapore, Jalpaiguri, Dinajpur, Pabna, Faridpur and Noakhali. I have addressed the District Boards concerned suggesting that they should take early steps to organise free vaccination throughout their respective districts. So far Jalpaiguri alone has responded in the affirmative and it would seem that District Boards generally do not realize that vaccination is an important branch of sanitation, for which they should accept responsibility. It should be mentioned here that in Bakarganj. 24-Parganas and Faridpur, the District Boards have already taken steps to organize free vaccination. And the sooner other District Boards follow their example and adopt measures for the thorough protection of the people against small-pox, the better it will be for the populations concerned. 6.

xv PROVINCIAL STATEMENT Axvi PROVINCIAL STATEMENT BMUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT. SANITATION. CALCUTTA, THE 17TH JULY 1917. RESOLUTION2 the improvement which can be effected by employing the powers permitted by law is afforded by the town of Asansol, where the reported birth-rate rose from 6.02 per mille in 1915 to 21.89 per mille in 1916 owing to a number of prosecutions being instituted for neglect to register vital occurrences. The Sanitary Commissioner rightly observes that3 the chief carriers of malaria are believed to be stream-breeding mosquitoes which differ in their habits from the common carriers of malaria met with in deltaic areas. The two schemes have been specially drawn up with the object of ascertaining the best method of dealing with these mosquitoes and determining the minimum area round a village that must be controlled in order to bring about a reduction of malaria. At Meenglass the hill streams, in which a dangerous species of anopheline mosquito breeds, will be put underground, the water being carried off in subsoil drains when the flow becomes sluggish, while the storm flow is allowed to pass over them in the usual stream channels. The Singaram scheme consists of two parts, viz., (1) a thorough surface drainage of the area to be experimented on, and (2) the periodical flushing of a small river in which malaria-carrying mosquitoes of a vicious character breed. The object of the first part is to drain away pools and depressions in which malaria- carrying mosquitoes breed: that of the second is to substitute a series of flushes in the river instead of a sluggish flow, for it has been ascertained that mosquitoes breed along its edge when the flow is gentle, but when the river is in flood their eggs and larvae are carried away. It is therefore pro- posed to construct a weir with sluices so arranged that, when the sluices are closed. a head of water will be accumulated behind the weir, and this will be periodically discharged so as to flush the bed of the rivulet. It is hoped that three of the schemes will be completed during the current year ; and the Governor in Council looks forward to the results of the experi- ments with much interest. 8. Stegomyia Enquiry.4 doubts the correctness of these figures and states that a new method of inspection which was introduced under his orders has brought to light the fact that in many districts from one-third to one-half of the children under five years of age escaped vaccination. 12. Plague.5 appeals to Government for grants-in-aid. The Governor in Council had therefore occasion to point out that the appointment of sanitary officers is now a statutory obligation, which must be discharged irrespective of the decision of Government on requests for financial assistance. All District Boards are also required by law to appoint a Sanitary Inspector, but there is at present no adequate definition of his duties, and rules prescribing the qualifications to be required for appointment have not yet been prescribed. The result has been considerable variety in the duties performed by the Sanitary Inspectors, and the scope of their work appears in some cases to be unduly limited. The Governor in Council has recently con- sulted District Boards and local officers as to the qualifications and functions to be required of these officers. 16.

THE following are the brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1917-18. 2. Officer in charge of the department.2 middle of the season is also supposed to have helped to reduce the number of operations. But it may be pointed out that there are reasons for believ- ing that last year's figures from this district were greatly exaggerated by the subordinate inspecting staff, with a view to drawing an enhanced amount in the form of capitation fees from the District Board. The matter is still under investigation. Incidentally it may be pointed out that in every district the lack of responsible supervision, owing to the fact that Civil Surgeons cannot give sufficient time supervising the vaccinations, leads to irregularities on the part of the vaccinators and subordinate inspecting staff, and nothing but the employment of full-time Health Officers, who can superin- tend vaccination by District Boards, will check this evil. In Jessore and Mymensingh the fall of the jute mill market and the consequent disinclination of the people to pay for vaccination fees contributed to the decrease noticed above. In Midnapore there was a slight increase in primary vaccinations, but a large decrease in re-vaccinations led to the net decrease quoted above. This is said to be the result of the Civil Surgeon's orders to the vaccinators to concentrate their efforts upon primary vaccination and to resort to re-vaccina- tion only in cases of necessity. 5.

Diagram illustrating death rates from Small-pox and the degree of protection afforded.4 the benefits of free vaccination, I have succeeded in inducing the Burdwan and Midnapore District Boards, to introduce this measure from next year under the supervision of a District Sanitary. Officer. The Municipal Commis- sioners of Burdwan, Darjeeling, Serampore Vishnupur. Kumarkhali and Maniktala, have also been induced to abolish the system of charging fees for home vaccination, so that people may fully avail themselves of this prophy- lactic. The quality of lymph manufactured at the Animal Vaccine Depôt, Calcutta, during the year was better than that of the previous year, but similar difficulties were experienced in preparing the vaccine lymph owing to the loss of shipments of lanoline and vaccine tubes by the operations of war. Persistent endeavours have been made during the year to induce both Muni- cipalities and District Boards to accept their full responsibilities in respect of vaccination ; and in some directions these efforts have met with promising success. But much more remains to be done and there is no prospect of any material improvement being effected in the efficiency of vaccination through- out the Province, until every district is provided with a full-time Health Officer and a trained subordinate staff, who can both organise vaccination work and carry out other much needed sanitary measures in addition. 17.

CALCUTTA, THE 22ND JULY 1918. RESOLUTION2 1916-17 the Corporation midwives attended 627 cases, and there were only three maternal deaths, while the number of infantile deaths within ten days after birth was 35. A system of periodical inspections of babies at their homes by the Lady Health Visitors has also been introduced, and the fact that there were only 19 deaths among 464 babies under observation justifies the claim of the Chairman that the measure has some potential value in the saving of infant lives. 5. Vital statistics.3 Singaram colliery in Burdwan. Delay in the completion of a masonry pier resulted in the structure being washed away by an unexpected flood, and difficulties, which were eventually overcome, arose over the abandonment of patches of rice cultivation which afforded breeding places for the anopheles mosquito. It is hoped that some idea may be gained of the effect of this scheme also after the rains of the current year. The scheme for flush drainage of an urban area at Jangipur was not completed in time to take advantage of the early floods, and consequently the flood water of the Bhagira- thi was only taken in twice late in the season. The works necessary for flooding a rural area in the Banka Valley near Burdwan could not be taken up in the absence of certain technical data which were required as a preliminary to engineering work. The engineering observations are now complete and the scheme is being proceeded with, while a special malaria survey has been carried out in 38 villages. Two Sub-Assistant Surgeons are now posted in this area to keep a record of births, deaths and sickness, while Sub- Assistant Surgeons have been sent to Meenglass, Singaram and Jangipur to watch the results of the schemes and supervise the free distribution of quinine and other drugs. In addition to the usual free distribution of quinine, of which the cost is met by Government, special measures were undertaken in several localities for the prevention and reduction of malaria. Anti-malarial surveys were carried out in the Basirhat and South Dum-Dum municipalities and in a large number of villages, as well as at the Kidderpore docks and the Sibpur College. Quinine was distributed to school children by five towns and five District Boards ; and a spleen census was taken by thirteen towns and two District Boards. Interesting proposals regarding the possibility of forecasting and miti- gating epidemics of malaria were received from Sir Leonard Rogers and were referred early in the year under review to the Sanitary Commissioner, whose report is still awaited. The Sanitary Commissioner draws attention to the efficacy of quinine prophylaxis in the case of European residents in the Duars. Ten years ago this district was so notoriously unhealthy on account of malaria and black-water fever that it was known as &quot; the white man's grave&quot;. In 1906, there were 20 deaths among 200 Europeans, most of whom were young adults. The daily use of a small dose of quinine as a prophylactic has now been adopted by almost the whole of the European community, with the result that black-water fever has now almost ceased to occur among them; enlarged spleens are rare ; Europeans are enabled to enjoy relatively good health ; and the Duars is now spoken of as &quot; a fairly healthy district &quot; There is also reason to believe that the prophylactic value of quinine is being recognized and appreciated by Indians to an increasing extent. Eloquent testimony on this point is afforded by editorial paragraphs which have recently appeared in the Bengalee and Amrita Bazar Patrika. The former journal points out that &quot; in the malaria season quinine is as much an essential commodity to the inhabitants of villages as food or clothing ;&quot; that the drug is &quot; an article of every-day necessity&quot; and ''as important as air or water &quot; to the mufassal public. The Amrita Bazar Patrika, which has hitherto been sceptical as to the benefits of quinine, remarks that a stoppage of the supply of quinine treatments to village post masters '' means the sure death of hundreds&quot; of persons for want of an ordinary medicine. Quinine may not always cure malaria, but there is no doubt that it is the only anti-malarial medicine hitherto discovered ....... In malarial places it is as essential as daily food.&quot; 8. Small-pox.4 vaccinations which occurred in several districts is ascribed partly to the diminished prevalence of small-pox and partly to the fact that the full staff of vaccinators was not at work in consequence of epidemics of malaria. Free vaccination was continued in the 24-Parganas and one subdivision of Bakarganj, and was introduced in Jalpaiguri. at the cost of the District Board, as well as in the Asansol mining settlement : in all these districts there was a marked increase in the number of operations. On the other hand, free vaccination had to be discontinued in a thana of the Faridpur district, where it had been introduced as an experimental measure in the previous year, as the people elsewhere refused to pay fees to the licensed vaccinators. 10. Cholera.5 Krishnagar, Midnapore and Suri, and sketch projects were prepared for six other localities, including Rajbari, where it is intended to execute a water-supply scheme, for which a grant of Rs. 10,000 has been sanctioned by Government. The riparian water works scheme for the supply of water to a number of municipalities on the east bank of the Hooghly above Calcutta was referred to the local authorities concerned during the year. It is regretted that financial stringency has prevented further progress with schemes of water-supply in urban areas, for, as pointed out by the Sanitary Commis- sioner, the introduction of filtered water-supply is always followed by a marked reduction in the mortality from cholera and dysentery and diarrh6 work can, in his opinion, be expected until there is a properly organized public health department in each district. The Governor in Council recognizes the steps already taken by District Boards to afford medical relief by the establishment and maintenance of dispensaries, but hitherto their energies have been devoted to the cure rather than the prevention of disease. It has not been sufficiently realized that public health is one of their primary duties, that they are responsible for initiating sanitary reforms in rural areas, and that for this purpose there must be an organized staff trained in modern methods of hygiene and capable of dealing with problems of public health. The great majority of the Boards have been satisfied with entertaining a low paid Sanitary Inspector of poor qualifications and with deputing doctors to deal with epidemics as they arise. Much more is required of the District Boards if they are to discharge their functions as guardians of the public health ; and orders are about to issue, as a preliminary measure of reform, requiring the appointment by all District Boards of a qualified District Health Officer, who will be responsible for vaccination work, measures against epidemics and sanitary education in rural areas. 17.

Infant mortality.3 especially heavy in the first six months, when also influenza was raging, fell in July and, after a slight rise in August, declined steadily each month. 8. Anti-malarial measures.4 Health, of the beneficial effects of which two instances may be mentioned. The ratio of infant mortality in the area under its jurisdiction was only 140 per mille compared with the rate of 342 in the district as a whole and the provincial rate of 228 : this satisfactory result is ascribed to the fact that the Board of Health employs a staff of trained midwives, who not only render gratuitous assistance to women during confinement but also act as health visitors The effect of the efficient system of vaccination and revaccination in force is apparent from the fact that there were only 14 deaths from small-pox, all imported, and that there were only 200 local cases, none of which proved fatal. 12.

SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1920-21. I have the honour to submit the following brief notes on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1920-21. 2. Officer-in-charge of the department.2 infants, in Jessore the death of four vaccinators and illness of eight and the inability of the local authorities to get substitutes in their places and in Dacca the want of energy amongst vaccinators owing to their inability to realise their fees on account of the partial introduction of free vaccination are said to be the additional factors for the decrease. 5. Vaccination in municipalities.Diagram illustrating death-rates from small-pox during the year 1920-21 and degree of protection afforded, 1914-15 to 1920-21. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
3 various kinds of lymph, their suitability for use in the mufassal, both during the hot and the cold seasons and the protective power of vaccination with the different kinds of lymph during the incubation period of small-pox. It has been ascertained that glycerine lymph deteriorates very rapidly in hot weather, whereas lanoline paste can with safety withstand at least for a week the trying weather, even during the hottest part of the year. Gly- corinated lymph should, therefore, be issued during the cold season and freshly prepared lanoline paste should be used during the hot weather. It has also been found out that by vaccinating with special varieties of lymph between the fourth and the sixth day of the incubation period, a person may more or less be protected from small-pox. 14.

SHORT NOTES ON VACCINATION IN BENGAL FOR THE YEAR 1921-22. I have the honour to submit the following brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1921-22:2 against 140,338 a decrease of 5.4 per cent. The average number of vaccina- tions performed by each vaccinator in mufassal municipalities was 737 against 680 during 1920-21 or an increase of 8 per cent. while that done by a licensed and paid vaccinator amounted to 781 and 1,215 against 1,084 and 1,452 during 1920-21, decreases of 28 per cent. and 16.3 per cent. respectively. Compared with the previous year, out of 28 districts including Calcutta only five, viz., Howrah, Calcutta, Khulna, Dinajpur and Tippera reported an increase in the total number of operations but there was a decrease of 1,356 in primary vaccination in Tippera. Six other districts, viz., Burdwan, Bankura, Nadia, Jessore Rajshahi and Malda reported an increase in primary vaccination but the reduction in re-vaccinations being large there was a decrease in the total operations performed in these districts. The largest increase (55,650) was reported from Calcutta where many vaccina- tions were performed in anticipation of a small-pox epidemic. The next largest increase (14,373) was in Tippera due it is said to the deputation of the Special Vaccination Inspector who did such good work in the Bakarganj district in recent years. He with the staff under him performed a large number of re-vaccinations in certain thanas of the district where small-pox generally breaks out. The increase in Dinajpur, Khulna and Howrah amounted to 8,497, 7,070 and 4,264, respectively. In the first two districts it is reported to be due to the introduction of free vaccination whereas in Howrah it is said to be owing to the specially good work of the staff and the care of the health officer. The decrease in the number of operations was most marked in Mymensingh (96,151), Bakarganj (91,919), Dacca (73,055), Faridpur (72,258), Rajshahi (64,590), Rangpur (51,868), Malda (23,026), Pabna (22,881), Jessore (18,199), Noakhali (17,422), Birbhum (16,945), Jalpaiguri (16,310), Midnapore (15,503), Bogra (14,745), 24-Parganas (14,571), Burdwan (12,586), Hooghly (10,885), Darjeeling (8,075) and Murshidabad (8,046). In Nadia, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bankura and Chittagong it amounted to 2,298, 1,283, 1,103 and 349, respectively. In Mymensingh, Dacca, Faridpur, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna, Midnapore and Hooghly districts the decrease is attributed to the fact that in consequence of the prevalence of small-pox in epidemic form during the previous year a large number of vaccinators had been employed either by District Boards or under the licensed system and the people came forward voluntarily for vaccination while during the year under report the disease was not very prevalent and hence comparatively less number of vaccinators were appointed. The Dacca District Board did not appoint any paid vaccina- tor during the year and the licensed vaccinators could not work energetically as the people refused to pay for their fees, they having received free vaccina- tion during the pevious year and learning that it has been introduced in the bordering districts. The unwillingness of the people to attend to public vaccine stations in Midnapore and Pabna and a severe prolonged outbreak of cholera in the Serajganj subdivision and in parts of the Sadar subdivision of the latter district during the first two months of the working season helped in the falling off. The non-co-operation movement in all these dis- tricts except Rajshahi and Dacca as well as in the districts of Bakarganj, Noakhali and Jalpaiguri are reported to be another factor for the decrease but in Bakarganj the withdrawal of the special vaccination campaign which was started during 1915-16 and continued till 1920-21 may be attributed to be another cause. In the 24-Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Jessore, Darjeeling, Malda and Chittagong Hill Tracts the decrease is said was due solely to less prevalence or comparatively absence of small-pox. In Birbhum district the appointment of insufficient number of vaccinators is reported was the cause of the decrease. At the beginning of the season the District Board appointed 98 secretaries of Union Boards to work as vaccinators in addition to their own duties but the scheme having proved unsuccessful 8 vaccinators were appointed in December 1921 and 4 more in February 1922. The decrease in the Chittagong district was insignificant and the prevalence of measles and itches amongst children was the cause. 5. Protection afforded to infants.DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING DEATH-RATES FROM SMALL-POX AND DEGREE OF PROTECTION AFFORDED DURING 1912-13 TO 1921-22. [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]
3 per mille were successfully vaccinated in the rural areas against 290.4 during the preceding year. Only in five districts the protection was over 500 per mille. The protection afforded to infants in municipalities is shown in Appendix VII from which it will appear that 627.5 per mille of the surviving infant population was protected during the year against 588.62 during 1920-21. 6.

CALCUTTA, THE 27TH JANUARY 1923. RESOLUTION2 The harvest of 1920 was comparatively favourable and the easier conditions as regards good supply gave in 1921 a reduced mortality, but the relative fall in the prices of agricultural produce, including rice, jute and oil seeds, caused a reduction in the normal surplus wealth of the cultivator. It is this surplus wealth which, '' spent almost exclusively in the mainten- ance of large and frequent families,&quot; promotes a higher conception and birth-rate. The statistics of vital occurrences in many towns are extraordinarily misleading. The machinery of registration differs fundamentally from that of rural areas. Registration in towns is compulsory, but until municipal boards appreciate more clearly the essential need of an accurate record, little will be done to compel parents, guardians and relatives to discharge this obligation to the State. In 1920, 36, and 1921, 28 towns out of 117 reported death-rates of less than 20 per mille. Manicktala however reported the high rate of 54.0 per mille in 1920, while Chandrakona in 1921 attained a similar pre-eminence with a mortality of 52.1 per mille. These figures are doubtless fairly accurate, but rates of 8.7 and 8.9 per mille in 1920 (Garulia and Kanchrapara) and 5.3 and 6.6 per mille in 1921 (Suri and Garulia) can only be greeted with blank incredulity. The condition of birth registration is equally discouraging. In 1920 only 38 towns and in 1921 only 36 recorded birth-rates exceeding 20 per mille, while in 14 towns (1921) the rate was less than 10 per mille. The town of Jessore returned the absurd figure of 3.6 per mille. '' These low birth-rates do not reflect the real condition of affairs, but are due to sheer neglect to administer the law.&quot; For seven years in succession, this flagrant neglect of the most ele- mentary principle of public health administration has been strongly criticised by the Director of Public Health. Dr. Bentley proposes that proper registrars should be appointed, under certain statutory conditions, to undertake this important work. The Minister for Local Self-Government agrees that an improvement in the registration of vital statistics is a most urgent sanitary reform, since it is on these figures that the sanitarian must ultimately rely in gauging the effects of a public health measure. 3. Infant mortality.3 reduction has occurred since 1915, since when the annual average has been 75,473 deaths or 34.3 per cent. below the average of the decade of 19014 traced to the restriction of normal inundation, which the multiplication of embankments tends to cause. The abatement of malaria is perhaps the most outstanding public health problem in Bengal. Experiments have been carried on in the colliery area (Singaron-Toposi) and at Meenglas in the Duars regarding the feasibility of reducing malaria, where infection is very intense, by removing the anopheles breeding places within a very limited area. The results were in 1920 largely negative, as showing that mosquito control to be effective in any locality must be extend- ed over a large surrounding area, but in 1921 a very satisfactory reduction of the total death-rate and of infant and malarial-mortality became evident. The Banka Valley scheme has admittedly improved local agricultural conditions, which are intimately connected with, the problem of malaria. It is certain that Government, apart from the narrow limits of its resour- ces, can do little to reach a solution of the problem without the willing and energetic co-operation of the people. The Minister accepts Dr. Bentley's main thesis that since anti-mosquito measures by drainage are impossible in a province like Bengal, the restrictions on natural inundation, which destroys the anopheles and at the same time improves agriculture, must so far as practicable be removed or mitigated. Co-operative irrigation societies are springing up and these in small areas, while aiming at economic improve- ment, will directly influence malaria ; local bodies have moreover, shown their anxiety to restore silted up khals and dying rivers and to bring bheel areas under cultivation. There is widespread recognition of the toll which malaria exacts in Bengal, and though the lines of advance are not easily laid down, the Minister believes that in encouraging local bodies to undertake- projects (such as the Bhairab scheme now under preparation) carefully framed so as to provide for the irrigation and inundation of affected areas, the abate- ment of malaria and the improvement of economic conditions in rural areas will be secured, and as a result of the latter the persons benefited will find no difficulty in paying the improvement cess, by means of which the local bodies recover their expenditure. 8. Kala-azar.5 The respective responsibilities of the board and the district board in rural areas falling within the limits of the Mining Settlement are not clearly defined, and the Mines Board of Health claims that the district board should undertake or subsidize medical and sanitary measures in these rural areas, which, if neglected, are a menace to the area directly administered by the former. The district board, however, con- tributed Rs. 1,000 to be spent through the agency of the Mines Board of Health in combating epidemic disease in the villages immediately outside the Mining Settlement. The Mines Board of Health has also undertaken the work of suppressing epidemic disease within the Asansol and Raniganj Municipalities, since the municipal boards under their present Act possess inadequate powers. The Raniganj Municipality has made a grant of Rs. 125 to the Board for this work. The Minister for Local Self-Government is glad to find that the Board's system for the prompt notification of epidemic disease has worked well, and that such notification has been followed up by vigorous measures to check the spread of the disease. There were 1,200 cases of cholera, giving an incidence of 3.64 on the total population, 583 cases ended fatally. The sterilisation of water supplied and the disinfection of houses and of persons attending patients received special attention. The incidence rate of vaccina- tion on population was .225. There were 93 cases with 10 deaths. It is gratifying to find that the number of primary vaccinations show a substantial increase on the figures of the previous year; the decrease in secondary vaccinations is attributed to the fact that the number of persons requiring re-vaccination in a well-protected area continually diminishes. The infantile mortality rate (163 per mille) is high, but nevertheless considerably less than the provincial rate (over 200 per mille). The Board has paid considerable attention to the investigation of con- ditions conducive to malaria, and6 Minister is aware that the health officer, both in municipalities and rural areas, is frequently regarded as an unnecessary burden on the local fund. But sanitary administration is the major part of local self-government, and prima facie, it would be surprising if expert supervision in matters of public health were a mere luxury. This condemnation of the public health expert is no new thing Dr. Bentley points out that even in the eighties, Sir Lyon Playfair, himself a medical man, in criticising English public health adminis- tration in Parliament, stated that a large proportion of the health officers then employed by the local authorities were paid to do nothing. But in England, the attitude of the public has changed. To a large extent the fall in the death-rate by 40 per cent. since the employment of an expert public health agency was made obligatory (1872) may be attributed to the scientific application of the principles of public health to the towns and country-side of England, and the Minister sees no reason why the health officers of Bengal should not do as good work as those of any other country, if they are given a fair chance. Some will be idle and inefficient and lacking the enthusiasm which, amid a general apathy, such an officer requires ; some may be timorous lest in their zeal they offend their employers ; but it is unreasonable to expect that an efficient organization of this kind should be built up in a day. II. Sanitary Engineering. Several important municipal water-supply and sewerage and drainage projects were prepared by the Chief Engineer, Public Health Department, in 1920 and 1921. Eight major water-supply projects were under construc- tion in 1920. Two were completed and six, with three schemes, were under execution in 1921. The total capital expenditure on water-supply in 1920 and 1921 was Rs. 7,79,538 and Rs. 7,34,443. Considerable progress was made with the important Dacca sewerage scheme, and the Kurseong scheme was practically completed. The total expenditure on municipal drainage works in 1920 was Rs. 2,14,004, and in 1921 was Rs. 3¾ lakhs. Sanitary works were also carried out at institutions such as the Bengal Engineering College, Dacca University, etc. The out-turn of the department has suffered from the general financial stringency. Local bodies have found it difficult to execute schemes which they have adopted, and it has been impossible in many cases for Government to find the grants-in-aid by which local enterprise is encouraged. It is worthy of mention that the important Titaghar sewerage scheme, for which the Jute Mill companies generously contributed nearly Rs. 7 lakhs, has now received the approval of the Legislative Council which was necessary, since the scheme commits Government after about two years to a capital expenditure of Rs. 3½ lakhs. Sanitation in the towns of Bengal is in most cases deplorably backward : few of the 117 municipalities possess a suitable water-supply, and the system of drainage is rarely efficient. Most of them with their present resources are unable to finance costly projects to make good these defects, and for them some cheaper form of water-supply, with a limited system of distribution based perhaps on sub-artesian borings, must be devised. There are, how- ever, many other municipalities which desire more complete and elaborate distribution system; if the schemes which have been prepared at their request are to be carried through, some increase in local taxation seems inevitable. Personal.7 and the Minister for Local Self-Government believes that the future will abundantly justify Dr. Bentley's administration of public health. He desires also to express his appreciation of Mr. G. B. Williams's able management of the sanitary engineering branch of the department. Since Mr. Williams's appointment, the number of major municipal projects executed under the direct supervision of the department has enormously increased. A time must come when this system will be changed, but the engineering staff, which Government have provided, has in the meantime been a very necessary adjunct to the grant-in-aid system which has been adopted in regard to local bodies. The Minister desires also to thank the other officers of the department whose services have been brought to his notice. The Port Health Department in Calcutta has been efficiently administered by Dr. Elmes, who is to be congratulated on the successful arrangements made in the past two years for the embarkation of pilgrims to the great Ganga Saugor Mela. The thanks of Government are finally due to the Sanitary Board for advising on the numerous sanitary schemes submitted by local bodies.

I submit the following report on Vaccination in Bengal for the triennial period from 1920-21 to 1922-23. 2. Officer-in-charge of the department.2 Midnapur (31,358), Dacca (31,060), Pabna (19,436), 24-Parganas (17,572), Nadia (15,254), Chittagong (13,150), Jalpaiguri (12,826), Rajshahi (12,008), Murshidabad (11,425), Birbhum (9,850), Noakhali (7,821), Malda (7,208), Bankura (5,753) and Bakarganj (5,003). While in other two districts (Chitta- gong Hill Tracts and Jessore) the increase was below 5,000. The largest decrease (37,647) was reported from Calcutta, the principal reduction (36,458) being in re-vaccination cases. This may be attributed to the large number of re-vaccination cases having been performed during the previous year (1921-22) in anticipation of a small-pox epidemic. The decrease was marked in Burdwan (16,385), Faridpur (8,569), Bogra (4,300), Howrah (4,007), Khulna (1,688) and Tippera (1,088). In other three districts, viz., Darjeeling, Hooghly and Dinajpur, the decrease was insignificant. Although there was a decrease in the total number of operations and also in re-vaccinations (41,023) in Tippera, still it stands first as regards increase (39,935), in the number of primary operations. The District Health Officer of Tippera attributes the reduction in re-vaccination cases to the absence of small-pox in epidemic form and to the fact that under the law as it stands at present the people cannot be compelled to accept re-vaccination in places where small-pox breaks out. The increase in primary cases in that district was due to the introduction of free and compulsory vaccination. The flood of the last year was responsible for the decrease of vaccination work in the Bogra District. In the list of increase in primary cases next to Tippera come Rangpur (35,740), Midnapur (29,432), Dacca (29,365), Mymensingh (24,980), Pabna (21,738), 24-Parganas (16,516), Dinajpur (15,572), Birbhum (11,151), Malda (9,947), Murshidabad (9,450), Rajshahi (9,122), Nadia (7,893), Noakhali (7,842) and Chittagong (5,336). In other districts the increase was below 5,000. In 16 out of 28 districts, there was an increase in re-vaccina- tion cases. Mymensingh with an increase of 32,593 operations stands first in the list. Next to this come Rangpur (9,869), Jalpaiguri (8,806), Chittagong (7,814), Nadia (7,361), Bankura (4,340) and Rajshahi (2,886), while the other districts show an increase of 1,000 to 2,000. The large increase in both primary and re-vaccination cases in Mymensingh is attributed to the introduc- tion of the paid system of vaccination, the close supervision of the inspecting officers and the prevalence of small-pox in the district. It was reported that the rate of success higher than 30 per cent. in re-vaccination in Rangpur was due to the absence of immunity amongst the majority of the people re-vacci- nated long after primary vaccination. On account of prevalence of small- pox in the Jalpaiguri district, the medical officers of fourteen dispensaries were supplied with lymph and lancets. Propaganda work with posters and pamphlets in hâts and railway stations resulted in the increase of primary and re-vaccination operations in Jalpaiguri. It is a matter of satisfaction that the introduction of free and compul- sory vaccination has been successful everywhere. It is reported that 4,000 people of the Debinagar Panchayat Union in the district of Malda have been vaccinated for the first time by the enforcement of the law, no vaccination work, either primary or re-vaccination, was done there within the last 20 years. In places, such as the 24-Parganas, Chittagong and Malda, where many persons who could not be vaccinated by inducement, had to get them- selves vaccinated on enforcement of the law.

CALCUTTA, THE 1ST MARCH 1924. RESOLUTION2 Health points out that the low death-rate, while partly due to improved economic conditions resulting from the relatively favourable harvest of 1921-22, was largely due to the natural reaction following upon the excessive mortality and the low birth-rates of the previous years. In fact the year 1922 was generally noticeable for low death-rates throughout India. Of the other provinces only two, viz., Assam and North-West Frontier Provinces, recorded a death-rate higher than Bengal. As was pointed out last year, it is the rate of natural increase (of births over deaths) and not the death-rate alone which affords the best evidence of a country's health, and judged by this standard Bengal compared very unfavourably with most of the other provinces, two only, viz., Assam and the North-West Frontier Province, showing a small rate of increase. Comparing the divisional birth-rates of the last few years it is observed that while there was an improvement in the Burdwan and Presidency Divisions, a considerable diminution of births occurred in the other three divisions. The divisions which show a reduced birth-rate are those specially interested in the cultivation of jute, and in the opinion of the Director of Public Health the relatively low price obtained by the cultivator for this commodity during the period from 1919 to 1921 has had an unfavourable influence on the birth-rate of all the jute-growing districts. The Director of Public Health has drawn attention to the interesting fact that contrary to the general belief, mortality goes down when prices go up, and that vice versâ, mortality rises as prices fall, and he explains that the agriculturist benefits most when he can obtain a reasonable return for the produce he has to sell: &quot;It will be seen that prices underwent a very sudden fall of over 30 per cent. between the summer of 1920 and the cold weather of 1920-21, and that this change was accompanied by a very great relative rise in mortality. On the other hand, the seasonal change in the price level in 1922 was only about 15 per cent. ; in other words, prices were much more stable in the latter year ; and co-incidentally with this the corresponding fluctuations of mortality were far smaller than in the former year. The most favourable condition for all classes of the population appears to be when prices are neither unduly high nor unduly low but remain at a more or less stable or fixed position, whereas if they fluctuate widely it is merely the small class of middlemen and speculators who benefit at the expense of both the consumer and the producer ; and the alternating periods of relative prosperity and economic stress that result are reflected in the oscillations that occur in the birth and death-rate of the community as a whole.&quot; 3. Infant mortality.3 As noticed last year, infant and maternal welfare centres have been doing good work for some time in Calcutta and Dacca A scheme was inaugurated during the year for the training of indigenous village dais, and the Minister is glad to learn that several district boards have arranged to start training centres for this purpose. The Asansol Mines Board of Health have set a good example by employing a small number of trained mid wives with considerable success, and it is reported that an increasing number of trained mid wives have settled down to private practice within the mining area. The Minister for Local Self-Government hopes that the widespread interest which has recently been aroused in the subject of maternity and child-welfare throughout the province as the result of the National Baby Week Exhibition held under the initiative of Her Excellency the Countess of Lytton will lead to a systematic organization being formed in every district for the training of dais, for the education of mothers, and for the formation of baby clinics and maternity welfare centres. 4. Child mortality.4 the general public are beginning to realize that cholera is essentially a preventible disease which can be properly controlled by the adoption of effective sanitary measures. The provision of an adequate and pure water- supply in rural and urban areas is obviously of primary importance in this connection. At the same time the Director of Public Health lays very great stress on the importance of taking preventive measures and of starting an anti-cholera campaign on organized lines in order to check the spread of the disease. As successful examples of measures of this kind he refers to the effective steps taken by the District Board of the 24-Parganas to prevent the occurrence of cholera at the last Ganga Saugor Mela, and the strenuous efforts made by the District Boards of Bogra, Rajshahi and Pabna, assisted by large bands of voluntary workers, for the prevention of cholera in areas which suffered from devastating floods in the latter part of the year. Enquiries made by the Director of Public Health have revealed that there are special centres of infection in various parts of Bengal, and that there are grounds for believing that cholera infection is often spread along lines of communication from other provinces. As he has pointed out, it is within the power of municipalities and district boards in Bengal to reduce cholera mortality to a minimum at a very small expenditure. The experience gained in anti-cholera work in several districts has shown that a reduction in cholera mortality is almost automatically brought about by the appoint- ment of a trained sanitary staff, and the Director of Public Health is confident that not only would cholera mortality be almost entirely checked if a small trained staff were provided for every thana in the province, but that many other diseases of a like infectious nature would also eventually be brought under control as a result of the establishment of an organization of this kind in each district under the direct supervision of the District Health Officer. The Minister for Local Self-Government trusts that this suggestion will meet with careful consideration on the part of local bodies. 7. Small-pox.5 8. Fever.6 channel has had the effect of improving the health of the adjacent villages. There has also been a great diminution of malaria at Kumarkhali where a small scheme has been carried out for flushing out the drains, ditches and hollows in and about the town with an abundant supply of water from the river. The Minister reiterates the policy laid down last year with regard to measures for the abatement of malaria and trusts that local bodies will show their readiness in undertaking projects which aim at the removal of restrictions on natural inundation, the flushing out of swampy areas which breed anopheles, and the general improvement of agriculture.

BENGAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. No. 2902-V. FROM DR. C. A. BENTLEY, M.B., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H., Director of Public Health, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, Local Self-Government Department. Calcutta, the 18th March, 1925. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of Bengal, the Provincial Statistical Vaccination Returns for the year 1923-24, with short Notes by Dr. Sufi, the Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of the Vaccination Bureau. The small-pox situation has been suffi- ciently reviewed by me in the appropriate section of the Bengal Public Health Report for the year 1923 and further general comment is unnecessary, here. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. A. BENTLEY, Director of Public Health, Bengal. 1 A
Short Notes on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1923-24. I have the honour to submit the follow- ing- brief notes on vaccination in Bengal for the year 1923-24 : 2. Officer in charge of the Depart- ment.2 operations, the number of districts are equally divided in the list of increase and decrease. Mymensingh with 49,380 operations stands first in the one while Pabna with 19,758 heads the other. Bakarganj, Howrah, Bogra , Tippera, Noakhali, Dacca, Rangpur, Chittagong and 24-Parganas recorded an increase of 12,383, 12,242, 11,970, 11615, 10,958, 8,958, 8,417, 7,687 and 7,677 primary opera- tions respectively, while Midnapur, Khulna, Faridpur, Jessore, Malda, Dinajpur and Rajshahi showed a de- crease of 13,231, 13,088, 6,675, 6,148, 5,829, 5,583 and 5,109 operations respectively. There was a general decline in re-vac- cination in 19 districts; of these Calcutta heads the list with a de- crease of 11,016 followed by Rajshahi with 10,953, Rangpur with 6,529, jalpai- guri with 5,792, Bankura with 4,104, Tippera with 4,074, Jessore with 3,442, Dacca with 3,311, Murshidabad with 3,290, Faridpur with 2,893, Dinajpur with 2,280, Midnapur with 2,147 and Bakarganj with 2,143. In other 6 dis- tricts, viz., Chittagong Hill Tracts, Mal- da, Nadia, Howrah, Birbhum and Pabna, it was below 2,000 and calles for no special notice. The cause of decline in Calcutta may be attributed to the want of incentive on the part of the people due to small number of deaths from small-pox. But in other districts the causes of this general falling off in re-vaccination have been ascribed to (1) apathy of the people towards re-vaccination, (2) want of power under the Vaccination Act to enforce re-vaccination and (3) want of help from the police, chaukidars and Panchayats. The absence of small- pox in epidemic form is also another factor for the decline. The increase in re-vaccination was noticed in Chitta- gong (13,153), Burdwan (12,035), Mymensingh, (5,512), 24-Parganas (4,448) and Noakhali (3,257). In Khulna, Bogra, Darjeeling and Hoogh- ly the increase was below 1,000. It appears from the report of the District Health Officer of Chittagong that the in- crease was due to the prevalence of small- pox in a fairly epidemic form. The di- sease was imported from the Arrakan District of Burma by the labouring classes during the crop season. The increase in both primary and re-vaccina- tion operations in Darjeeling is ascribed by the Civil Surgeon to the occurrence ofsmallpox cases in Kalimpong Circle where 5 cases and 4 deaths from this cause were recorded; most of these cases being imported from Sikkim and Tibet. The general progress of vaccination work in rural areas during the last two years shows the benefit of free vaccination which the people in general have come to realise. But in some districts, such as Chittagong, Hooghly, Dinajpur and Faridpur, where people could not be in- duced to accept vaccination, they have got to be vaccinated by the enforcement of law. 5.

3 From the figures noted below, it would appear that the condition of vaccina- tion in those municipalities is very un- satisfactory :4 1,507,487, grains of the two preceding years leaving a balance of 74,869 grains only in hand on the 1st April, 1924. Of the total supply of lymph, only 7,682 grains of lanolinated paste were issued during the year, showing how thoroughly the reputation of glycerinated lymph has been established. All the glycerinated stock as usual was analysed bacteriologically on Agar Plates at the Public Health Laboratory and declared fit only after being tested on guinea pigs. Only such tested lymph was issued to the public. 14. Different methods of vaccina- tion.STATEMENT No. I. 2

xv PROVINCIAL STATEMENT BGOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Public Health. No. 1876 P.H. FROM S. W. GOODE, ESQ., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND LANDS. Calcutta, the 9th October 1925. SIR, I AM directed to submit for the information of the Government of India copies of the reports noted below together with a copy of the resolution recorded thereon :GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Public Health. DARJEELING, THE 5TH SEPTEMBER 1925. RESOLUTION2 As regards birth registration in towns the Director of Public Health remarks as follows :3 information at present available to state with any certainty whether this low incidence is to be interpreted as evidence of a definite decline in small-pox prevalence or whether it is the prelude to a specially severe recrudescence on the return of the usual periodic epidemic. The Khulna District Board is to be congratulated on its very satis- factory small-pox statistics ; Khulna vaccinators are reputed to be the best operators in the province, while the public health of this district is particu- larly good. The total number of vaccinations reported in the Presidency in 1923-24 was 2,057,724 against 2,006,140 during 1922-23. These figures represent an increase of 64,191 in primary vaccinations, and a decrease of 12,607 in re- vaccinations. Out of 1,355,980 infants requiring vaccination, only 278,286 or 205.2 per mille were reported to have been successfully vaccinated in the rural areas, as compared with 290,172 or 290.4 per mille of 998,829 infants in the previous year, the proportion of successful vaccination in the case of children under one year of age being 251'2 per mille as against 268.1 per mille in the year 1922-23. The protection afforded was obviously most inadequate. The chief cause of the decline in the number of successful vaccination of infants was the fact that people are generally averse from having their children vaccinated until they are several years old. An additional grant of Rs. 25,000 was provided in the budget for 1924-25 for the suppression of outbreaks of small-pox epidemics. Fever.4 Health Association opened numerous centres where gratuitous treatment is afforded to kala-azar patients. In 1924-25, Government sanctioned the pay- ment of Rs. 30,000 to district boards and of Rs. 5,000 each to the Bengal Central Anti-Malaria Co-operative Society and to the Bengal Health Associa- tion for anti-kala-azar work. Admirable work has been done at the special centres to which a very large number of kala-azar patients resort. The Governor in Council is convinced that efficient medical relief can be provided at a comparatively small cost by assisting local bodies and voluntary agency with small grants from provincial revenues.

SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of Bengal, the Provincial Statistical Vaccination Returns for the year 1924-25, with short Notes by Dr. Sufi, the Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of the Vaccination Bureau. The small-pox situation has been sufficiently reviewed by me in the appropriate section of the Bengal Public Health Report for the year 1924 and further general comment is unnecessary here.

3 other diseases in its trail requiring greater attention to be paid to them in- stead of to small-pox which was not pre- sent in an epidemic form in the district. The District Health Officer of Rangpur also points to the smaller number of vac- cinators employed by the District Board, and attributes to it the decrease in vaccination operations by 22,355 dur- ing the year in his district. In Dinaj- pur also there was a total decrease of 4,855 operations. Although there was a remarkable in- crease in the total number of operations in all the districts of Bengal excepting the three mentioned above, primary operations performed during the year out-number the records of the previous year only in fifteen districts. Bakar- ganj with 23,141 primary operations headed the list. Next in order of num- erical superiority came Dacca (21,020), Calcutta (19,363), Birbhum (16,793), Khulna (14,843), Pabna (13,566). Faridpur (8,460), Noakhali (5,553), Raj- shahi (4,793), Burdwan (4,641), Malda (3,980) and Midnapur (2,993). In other three districts, viz., Mymensingh, Chittagong Hill Tracts and Murshida- bad, the increase was below 2,000. Decrease in primary operations oc- curred in Rangpur (20,855), Tippera (19,451), Dinajpur (8,576), 24-Parga- nas (4,841), Bogra) (4,586), Chittagong (4,518), Bankura (3,713), Darjeeling (2,691) and Jalpaiguri (2,485) and in the districts of Jessore, Nadia, Howrah and Hooghly it was below 2,000. As a precaution against the appre- hended outbreak of small-pox epidemic during the year under review, the im- perative necessity of carrying on a vi- gorous and systematic vaccination and re-vaccination campaign in their res- pective jurisdiction was impressed upon the local bodies including the District Boards and Municipalities by the Pub- lic Health Department and I am glad to note that as a whole they did their best to follow the instructions of the Department in the matter. As a result thereof, there had been a general rise in the number of re-vaccination cases in all the districts in this Presidency ex- cept Tippera and Rangpur. Calcutta, which showed during the previous year the largest decrease in re-vaccinations, occupied this year the first place in the roll of increase in re-vaccinations amounting to 237,890 operations. Next in order of numerical superiority in re-vaccination cases came Burdwanwith 33,321, Mymensingh with 29,575, Jessore with 24,869, 24-Parganas with 24,268. Malda with 18,452, Rajshahi with 17,991, Hooghly with 17,115, Howrah with 16,321, Nadia with 13,852, Chittagong with 12,574, Dacca with 12,026, Khulna with. 10,189, Bir- bhum with 9,906, Bankura with 3,807, Midnapur with 7,776, Darjeeling with 6,603 and Bogra with 6,301 operations. In the remaining eight districts, viz., Noakhali, Faridpur, Pabna, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Bakarganj, Chittagong Hill Tracts and Murshidabad, the in- crease was below 5,000. 6. Vaccination in municipalities.4 With the exception of the jails there was an increase over the preceding year in the number of operations performed by every other agency. With regard to tea gardens, the figures received in the Public Health Department are in- complete due to the fact that since the transfer of the vaccination work in Jal- paiguri from the Civil Surgeon to the District Health Officer, reports of the vaccination cases are not being regular- ly furnished by the managers of the tea gardens to the latter. Thus during the year under review only 120 operations were reported to have been performed in the numerous tea gardens in that district. The attention of the Duars Planters' Association was drawn to the matter but it is noticed with regret that no real improvement has yet been effect- ed. I take this opportunity to state that the Railway and Steamer compan- ies who were invited to co-operate with the Public Health Department in pre- venting the dissemination of small-pox rendered their best assistance in achiev- ing the end. During the year 26,055 and 12,045 vaccination operations were performed respectively within the rail- way limits and in the area under the jurisdiction of the Port of Calcutta against 24,109 and 11,274 during the previous year. 8. Protection afforded to infants.No. 305 P.H. FROM J. G. DRUMMOND, ESQ., I.C.S., Offg. Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Local Self-Government (Public Health) Department, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND LANDS. Calcutta, the 5th February 1926. Annual Public Health Report for 1924. SIR, I AM directed to submit for the information of the Government of India copies of the reports noted below, together with a copy of the resolution recorded thereon :GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Public Health. CALCUTTA, THE 2ND FEBRUARY 1926. RESOLUTION2 &quot; In Eastern Bengal, however, these relationships with rice harvests do not occur, in fact the relationships are rather reversed. The explanation probably lies in the different class of crop grown in Eastern Bengal, viz , jute. The demand for jute is a world-wide one, and the price of jute is therefore often determined by factors outside of Bengal. Falling jute prices, moreover, are associated often with good harvests, a good harvest does not therefore mean increased prosperity, as a good rice harvest does to the people of Western and Central Bengal. Conditions therefore tending to favourable vital occurrences in Western and Central Bengal may tend to unfavourable vital occurrences in Eastern Bengal and vice versa, so that it is necessary to appreciate these differences in economic and agricultural conditions before drawing conclusions as to the health condi- tions in the different parts of the province. On the whole, however, the conditions governing the production of jute are not so liable to fluctuations as those of rice produc- tion, and these vital occurrences tend to be more stable in Eastern than in Western and Central Bengal. The desideratum is the stabilisation of both rice harvests and of death- rates, and it would appear that the stabilisation of one would produce a similar effect on the other.&quot; 3. Registration of births and deaths.3 realise that cholera is essentially a preventible disease. Inoculation against the disease was proved to be most effective and does not appear to be unpopular. Small-pox.4 of Kala-azar cases treated at hospitals, dispensaries and special centres was 139,085 in 1924 against 57,238* in 1923, 13,317 in 1922 and 7,698 in 1921. It is satisfactory to note that several Kala-azar centres were opened by district boards during 1924, in addition to those started by voluntary insti- tutions such as the Central Co-operative Anti-malaria Society and the Bengal Health Association. The Governor in Council desires also to record his warm appreciation of the fine work done at the Kala-azar centres of these two latter bodies. Their humanitarian work is well organized, and their Kala-azar centres are working on sound, efficient and economical lines. Rai Bahadur Dr. Gopal Chandra Chatterjee and Dr. Bhattacharya have deserved well of their generation. Sanitary Engineering.5 preceding years. The epidemic signal- led its advent by a distinct rise in the mortality from small-pox especially in Calcutta when small explosive outbreaks occurred in November and December, 1924, and the Public Health Department lost no time in giving time- ly warnings to the local bodies. They were urged in the Public Health Depart- ment circular letter No. 48-E., of 1924, to push forward vaccination and re-vac- cination as widely as possible and it was pointed out to them that Calcutta was likely to serve as the distributing centre from which the infection of small-pox would disseminate throughout the Presi- dency. The various Railway Compan- ies and the Inland Steam Vessel Ser- vices were also advised to take such steps as will prevent the spread of the disease. In Calcutta the number of at- tacks and deaths rapidly went up week by week, until it attained the maximum in March. Since then the epidemic tended to decline and during the latter part of June, 1915, it practically sub- sided. A total of 2,708 deaths from small-pox occurred in the City during the year under report. Next in order of the severity of the epidemic came the district of the 24-Parganas with 1,727 deaths, Burdwan with 752, Mymen- sing with 714, Howrah with 636, Dacca with 531, Midnapur with 469, Chit- tagong with 440, Bogra with 433, Hooghly with 425, Jalpaiguri with 271. Malda with 185, Bankura with 184 and Rangpur with 125 deaths. In other districts it was below 100. It will ap- pear from the Statement No. VI at- tached to this report that the epidemic of small-pox of 1925 was neither so severe as regards its total mortality nor so widely spread as that of 1919-20, be- ing specially confined to Calcutta and its neighbouring districts, the outlying districts being comparatively lightly affected. The actual mortality in Cal- cutta was distinctly higher than in the previous epidemic. 14. Admissions to the Campbell Hospital, Calcutta, from small-pox.6 operations performed with the various kinds of lymph and the percentage of success in each case :7 courage inborn in him as one belonging to a Pathan race to face the occasionally murderous assaults to which a Sub-In- spector of Vaccination had recently suc- cumbed in one of the districts of East- ern Bengal. On my first inspection of Bakarganj district where I spent full five winter months I found that vaccina- tion of infants was unknown and only about 5 per cent. of the entire popula- tion was vaccinated. The vaccination reports submitted by the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors were entirely faked and untrustworthy. The Special Inspector was thereupon, on my recommendation, deputed with a staff of 20 vaccinators to that district and house-to-house vacci- nation started. Within a period of 6 years the entire district as far as practi- cable was visited by the Special Inspec- tor and his staff. A total of 506,124 persons out of a population of 2,380,293 were vaccinated inspite of fierce opposi- tion by the inhabitants. In 1922, how- ever, Haji Jan Khan, the Special In- spector, retired and the staff broken up. The results of this special campaign were striking as shown by the following statement from which it will appear that in Bakarganj district the small-pox death-rate came down from .21 per mille and .18 per mille in the epidemics of 1908-09 and 1914-15 respectively to .02 per mille in 1924-25 epidemic, while in three of the districts of that circle where the condi- tions of opposition were the same, the death-rate increased, especially in Chit- tagong where the rise was 800.0 per cent. Assuming these returns to be fairly accurate, the results are encour- aging enough to lead me to suggest the appointment of one Special Inspector of Vaccination for each division to help the District Health Officers in prepar- ing their respective districts to meet the anticipated small-pox epidemic in 1930 which, according to Dr. Bentley's fore- cast, is likely to be the severest epidemic the world has experienced during the last 60 years. It is only by pushing vac- cination and re-vaccination to the ex- treme during the intervals of the two quinquennial periods, that there is any chance of mitigating its severity if not altogether stamping out the disease by affording protection to as much of the population as is possible under the cir- cumstances. Further, I would suggest that these Special Inspectors may be selected for their experience in vaccina- tion work from amongst men who havespent most part of their lives in the ser- vice of the Department, gaining valu- able experience thereby, rather than from raw recruits from the medical de- partment who, however qualified they may be, know nothing about the practi- cal side of the vaccination work. It is to be remembered in this connection that in the campaign of 1914-20 the local Government not only contributed the pay of the Special Inspector but also that of the vaccinators employed in the staff. At the present moment, the last item would have to be paid for by the District Boards who appoint their own paid vaccinators.

Before closing this report, I would like to thank the District Health Officers for the active measures of precaution which they promptly adopted against the spread of the epidemic at the in- stance of the Public Health Depart- ment. The Public Health organisa- tions which now exist in the districts and the readiness so far shown by the District Health Officers to adopt the in- structions of the Public Health Depart- ment in matters relating to sanitation are an indication of a brighter day when epidemics will be rare in Bengal. The gradual fall of small-pox incidence since the appointment of District Health Officers and the introduction of free vaccination in the various districts tends to such optimism. 19.

BENGAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. No. 770 V. From DR. C. A. BENTLEY, M.B., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H., Director of Public Health, Bengal. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL. LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Calcutta, the 12th January, 1927. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of Bengal, the Provincial Report on Vaccination for the triennium 1923-24 to 1925-26 including the Statistical Vaccination Returns for the year 1925-26, by Dr. Sufi, the Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of the Vacci- nation Bureau. The smallpox situation has been sufficiently reviewed in the appropriate section of the Bengal Public Health Report for the year 1925 and further general comment is unnecessary here. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant. CHAS. A. BENTLEY, Director of Public Health. Bengal.
Thirteenth Triennial Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the years 1923-24, 1924-25 and 1925-26. 1. I have the honour to submit the following Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the triennial period from 1923-24 to 1925-26. 2. Dr. G. L. Batra, Assistant Direc- tor of Public Health, was in charge of the Vaccination and Vital Statistics Bureau till the 3rd of May 1923, when he was succeeded by Dr. B. B. Brahma- chari, Assistant Director of Public Health, Presidency Circle. I returned from leave on the 9th May 1924 and since then have been in charge of the bureau. 3. Strength of Staff.2 districts, headed by Mymensingh (58,209) and followed by Rangpur (15,470), Noakhali (11,889) Murshida- bad (11,611), Jalpaiguri (8,595), Farid- pur (7,213), Nadia (6,194), Bakarganj (5,843), Dinajpur (5,330), Pabna (5,201), and Burdwan (5,083); in 8 others the increase was below 5,000. Decreases were reported from Tippera (11,897), Bogra (10,328), Khulna (8,273), Birbhum (7,310), Midnapur (6,019), 24-Parganas (3,211), Rajshahi (2,573) and Malda (1,801). All these latter districts, however, as is detailed below, with the exception of Malda, returned an increase in the respective number of their revaccinations. Twenty- two districts reported an increase in re- vaccination operations over those of the previous year3 7. Vaccination performed by other agencies.4 DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING DEATH-RATES FROM SMALLPOX AND DEGREE OF PROTECTION AFFORDED DURING 1916-17 TO 1925-26.

5 Rs. 359,906-9-6 in the previous one and the cost of each successful case 3 annas and 6 pies and 3 annas and 4 pies during the two triennial periods, respectively. The increased average cost per case during the present triennium was due to the introduction of paid vaccination in all the districts of the province. 12. Diagram illustrating Death-rates from Smallpox and the degree of Protec- tion afforded since the year 1916-17.6 the Assistant Superintendents of Vacci- nation and 87.8 per cent. primary and 34.5 per cent. revaccinations by the Municipal Inspecting Officers. The highest percentage of primary cases (14.32) was inspected by the district Health Officer of Chittagong and that of revaccinations (6.44) by the Hooghly District Health Officer. The District Health Officer of the 24-parganas could only inspect .07 per cent. primary and .02 per cent. revaccinations. Inspection by Municipal Supervisors was worst in Burdwan, where only 7.51 per cent. of primary and 1.65 per cent. of revaccina- tions were inspected. In the rural areas, the highest percentage of primary cases (155.2) was inspected by the Assistant Superintendents of Vaccina- tion, Howrah and that of revaccinations (128.8) by those of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In this connection, it may be noted that the results of vaccination operations as reported in the returns are extremely unreliable and unless a vigil- ant care is exercised by the superior supervising authorities, there is no hope of any accuracy in such information. A branch vaccination centre has recently been opened at the Bengal Vaccine Depôt, and as soon as sufficient data are available, a fair index of the correct- ness or otherwise of the results of oper- ations performed in the mufassal will be at the disposal of the Bengal Public Health Department. 16. Bengal Vaccine Depôt.7 law to help the local sanitary authorities in undertaking these defensive measures has been keenly felt by some of the more vigilant District Health Officers, who have on frequent occasions brought this matter to the notice of the Public Health Department. Revaccination is voluntary and so far as vaccination of contacts is concerned, if the latter happen to be under the age of six months in Western Bengal or under one year in Eastern Bengal, no legal steps can be taken to enforce vaccination until they are past that age. Steps are being taken by the Public Health Department to enlist the co-operation of the various local bodies in the province in this matter and it is intended to take further action when a consensus of favourable opinion has been secured. (c) The licensed system of vaccination has been sufficiently proved by the experience of the various local bodies to stand as an impediment in the path of the onward progress of vaccination among people, who, however genuinely anxious to take it otherwise, are unwill- ing to pay for it; and yet it is a deplorable fact that a couple of District Boards reverted to that system for some months at least during the course of the year under review. It will be to their own interest and the interest of the people living in their jurisdiction if they could see their way in future to make vaccina- tion entirely free. It is only in this way that they can hope to keep their doors closed for good against smallpox. M. E. SUFI, L.R.C.P. & S., D.P.H., Assistant Director of Public Health, Vaccination and Vital Statistics. CALCUTTA, The 20th December 1926.

RESOLUTION2 There is no doubt that there has been a stirring up of the public con- science in the matter of maternal and infant welfare and that deep-seated prejudices are being gradually uprooted. There are grounds for expecting a material reduction in the rate of infant mortality in the near future as a result of progressive enlightenment and increased interest in a subject which is of such importance for the well-being of Bengal. Cholera.3 two water-supply and two sewerage projects were partially completed during the year under review.

BENGAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. No. 18103-V. FROM DR. C. A. BENTLEY, M.B., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H., Director of Public Health, Bengal. To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Calcutta, the 19th October 1927. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of Bengal, the Provincial Statistical Vaccination Returns for the year 1926-27, with short notes by Dr. Sufi, Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of Vaccination in the Bengal Public Health Department. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, C. A. BENTLEY, Director of Public Health, Bengal.
Short Notes on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1926-27. As the Officer in charge of Vaccina- tion in the Provincial Public Health Department, I have the honour to sub- mit the following brief report on vacci- nation in Bengal during the year 1926- 27. In furtherance of the policy of ex- pansion of local self-government, the entire provincial vaccination establish- ment of Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors was transferred to the District Boards (except Darjeeling) with the close of the year for future direct administration and control, the Local Government having agreed to meet the whole estimated cost at Rs. 95 a month for an Inspector and at Rs. 65 a month for a Sub-Inspector. Due to the employment of all available qualified Sanitary Inspectors for the ruarl Public Health organisation, re- cruitment for the Vaccination Branch is practically suspended, nor is it desired to keep such a separate branch service permanently alive, in view of the provi- sion of thana health circles throughout the province, except the Darjeeling dis- trict and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. When the scheme for a rural public health organisation is in full operation, it will be unnecessary to provide sepa- rately for the inspection of vaccination alone, as the duties of the rural Assis- tant Health Officers and Sanitary Ins- pectors include such vaccination work. But District Board will still be requir- ed to maintain their complement of pub- lic vaccinators in addition to the rural Circle Health Assistants. The cost of of such establishments will be met from the present annual district provisions for public health including vaccination, which will be increasingly relieved by the general public health organisation, the whole cost of which, estimated at twelve lakhs of rupees per annum. will be borne by provincial revenues. 2.

9 Department were promptly deputed to the affected places as soon as any infor- mation of an outbreak was received and were constantly kept on tour during the period from November 1926 to May 1927. A hundred temporary Sanitary Inspectors and 20 temporary Sub-Assis- tant Surgeons placed on epidemic duty in several districts were instructed to help the local authorities in vaccinating the people. The District Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Vaccination were also directed to do vaccination themselves, in addition to inspection. I also visited several districts to investigate the cause of the local continuance of the epidemic and advised the local health authorities. 13. Different Methods of Vaccina- tion.10 4,055 grains lanolinated vaccine paste. These figures show the necessity of an adequate supply of lymph being kept in reserve at the Bengal Vaccine Depôt. The discovery by Dr. Blaxall of the Government Lymph Establishment at Hendon, London, that lymph could be kept without losing its potency for a long period of time, if stored at 10° Faren- heit, will enable a reserve supply of lymph to be maintained in sufficient amount to meet the demand which would arise should small-pox become epidemic. Due to the failure of all efforts to in- crease the local calf-supply for the cen- tral depôt at Intally, a scheme is being matured to open a branch depôt at Ramna (Dacca) and it is hoped to com- plete it in time for its inclusion in the budget for the year 1929-30. Mean- while, it may be necessary to supplement the local production of lymph by pur- chase from other provinces. 16. English Vaccination Committee.11 preparation should consist in wholesale vaccination and re-vaccination of the whole population. 21. The protection which vaccination and re-vaccination affords cannot be dis- puted by anyone who has had actual experience in dealing with small-pox.

BENGAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. No. 2057 V. FROM DR. C. A. BENTLEY, M.B., D.P.H., D.T.M. & H., Director of Public Health, Bengal, To THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT. Calcutta, the 15th January, 1929. SIR, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Govern- ment of Bengal, the Annual Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1927-28 with the statistical vaccination returns by Dr. Sufi, Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of Vaccination in the Bengal Public Health Department. The subject has been more fully dealt with in this report than in previous annual vaccination reports. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, CHAS. A. BENTLEY, Director of Public Health, Bengal. 1 A
Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the year 1927-28. I have the honour to submit the following report on vaccination in Bengal during the year 1927-28 I was in charge of the Vaccination Bureau in the Provincial Public Health Department throughout the year. 2. Strength of staff.6 6. The following statement compares the primary and re-vaccinations in rural areas performed during the year under review and the previous year :7 of small-pox occurred during the year. This point will be referred to again later in this report. But while the primary and re-vaccinations as a whole, showed an excess over those of the pre- vious year, the former outnumbered the latter by 44,244 in 1927-28 in 15 districts as follows :8 [NLS note: a graphic appears here - see image of page]

11 states that he vaccinated about 1,000 persons with his own hand by this method and he found it more successful than the old gridiron process. Others relying on the reports of their Sub-In- spectors of Vaccination and vaccinators hold a reverse opinion. Naturally the vaccinators, used to the old method, feel a distaste for any innovation and so long as they are not sufficiently practised in the new method, the results obtained by them cannot be accepted as a reliable index of the failure of the linear method vaccination. 11. Cost of Vaccination.12 deaths have ever been on the increase, with remissions every third or fourth year for two or three seasons and never recording a rate below .08 per mille. It is quite possible that the present epidemic may simply be a fore runner of the appre- hended pandemic and may subsequently merge into it. To meet the pandemic a proposal has been submitted to the local Government for a provision of adequate funds in the ensuing year's public health budget to enable local authorities to carry out under the supervision of the Public Health Department intensive campaigns of mass re-vaccination against the appre- hended pandemic of small-pox. All local bodies have been asked to strain every nerve to put the public health organisa- tion of the province on the best possible footing so as to push forward vaccination and re-vaccination as widely as possible. The supervising rural health staff com- posed of the Sanitary Inspectors in charge of health circles and Vaccination Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors were urg- ed early in the season to perform vaccina- tion with their own hands in epidemic areas and their work as shown below, except in a few instances, e.g., in Nadia and Jalpaiguri, has not been negligible. Intensive campaigns of vaccination and re-vaccination were undertaken in Mid- napur, Pabna, Murshidabad, Birbhum, Rangpur, Dinajpur and Malda districts. The Government staff was frequently deputed to help the local bodies in their vaccination campaigns. In addition to both the Special Inspectors of Vaccina- tion who were continually kept on the move throughout the year, Babu Suren- dra Nath Mazumdar, a Bengal Vaccine depot assistant, operated upon 4,651 persons in the English Bazar Munici- pality during the course of a very severe outbreak of small-pox in Malda district which starting in November 1927 lasted throughout the year, affecting simulta- neously about 284 villages and claiming 1,482 victims out of 6,875 persons attack- ed from January to April 1928. The campaign in Malda district is still going on and 157,773 operations have been per- formed there during the last four months of the current year. A full report on the epidemic and the steps taken to com- bat it will form part of the next year's vaccination report. 13. Percentage of success with gly- cerinated lymph.13 The highest percentage of success in primary cases 100.0 per cent. was observ- ed by the District Health Officer of Jessore and the Civil Surgeon of Darjee- ling; in re-vaccinations the maximum 97.5 per cent. was noted by the District Health Officer, Rangpur. On the other hand only 23.8 per cent. of the primary and 14.8 per cent. of the re-vaccination cases inspected were found to be success- ful by the District Health Officers of Bakarganj and Mymensingh respectively. (b) So far as the municipal inspecting staff was concerned, the highest percen- tage of primary cases (80.0) was inspect- ed in the municipalities of Dinajpur dis- trict, and of re-vaccinations (63;2) in those of Hooghly, the lowest 4.6 for primary and 4.9 for re-vaccinations be- ing noted by the Howrah municipal staff. A success of 100.0 per cent. in primary cases was recorded by the Jessore and Jalpaiguri municipal staff, and of 75.5 per cent. in re-vaccination by that of Nadia. The minimum percen- tage of success in primary cases (81.9) and in re-vaccinations (13.02) was regis- tered in the municipalities of Bankura. (c) The rural inspecting staff inspected the highest percentage of primary cases (83.8) in Darjeeling district and that of re-vaccinations (66.3) in the Chittagong Hill Tracts while at the other end only 1.8 per cent. of the primary cases and 1.4 per cent. of re-vaccinations were inspected by the rural staff of Malda and Mymensingh districts. The inspection percentage of Birbhum, Bankura, Pabna and Malda staff in primary cases and of Birbhum, Bankura, Midnapur, Nadia, Jessore, Khulna, Rajshahi, Jalpaiguri, Pabna, Malda, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Tippera staff in re-vaccinations is extremely low, being below 10 per cent. This state of affairs is to be highly depre- cated, since it is certain to lead to a dete- rioration of vaccination work both in quantity and quality which is extremely undesirable especially at the present stage when the whole province has already been in the throes of. an epidemic of small-pox since 1924 and a still worse pandemic is apprehended to start about 1930-33. The Malda staff noted the highest per- centage of success (98.4) in primary cases and Midnapur 96;8 in re-vaccina- tions. The minimum 86.8 per cent. inprimary cases and 28.4 per cent. in re- vaccinations was registered by Mymen- singh and Burdwan staff respectively. I am inclined to doubt the accuracy of these percentages especially in re-vaccina- tion cases. In my experience even a 50 per cent. success in revaccination cases is hardly attained and 96.8 per cent. success as observed by the Midnapur staff is absurd. A scratch mark on the skin is not to be taken as an index of success unless there is foveation; of course I ex- clude cases of accelerated reaction which are never noticed by the inspecting staff. 15. Bengal Vaccine Depot.14 very severe pandemic of the same disease is apprehended about 1930-33. A wide- spread protection of the general popula- tion by means of intensive campaigns of mass re-vaccination in every part of the province is therefore absolutely necessary before the pandemic actually sets in. Local efforts, however strenuous, are hampered by want of funds. The recur- ring grant of Rs. 50,000 made by the local Government annually to promote free vaccination is not enough to meet the new situation. A special contribu- tion under the circumstances, therefore, becomes a matter of imperative necessity and should no longer be delayed. Spe- cial arrangements should be made to ensure a much larger supply of vaccine lymph than what the Bengal Vaccine Depot can possibly manufacture. Nothing can be more fatal to the success of a campaign than the failure of thelymph supply at a time when it is essen- tially wanted by the operators. Super- vision is also a matter of vital importance. Unfortunately, the Vaccination Bureau is very much handicapped in having only two Special Inspectors of Vaccination at its disposal for the present. Without four such officersStatements. 4 A

RESOLUTION2 Extremely interesting results have been obtained in Calcutta and Dacca by special attention to midwifery and the care of infant life. In Calcutta there were five units at work staffed by 5 Lady Health Visitors and 18 mid- wives. In 4,748 cases attended by them the death-rate during the first ten days of infancy was only 35 ;5 per thousand as against the average for the city of 104.8 per thousand, while only 13 cases proved fatal to the parent. Two maternity centres working in the town of Dacca, and dealing with slightly over a thousand cases reported mortality during the first ten days of infancy of only 22 per thousand as against recorded mortality of 96 per thousand in the rest of the town. These figures go to show what can be accomplished by the proper care of mothers and infants. During the year under review grants-in-aid were made to various local bodies for starting 100 classes of 10 dais each. In all 1,170 dais received training in 104 classes started by 49 local bodies and one health society. Public interest in maternity work and infant welfare was maintained and 67 health exhibitions and Baby Week functions were held during the year.

SIR, I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of Bengal the Provincial Report on Vaccination for the triennium 1926-27 to 1928-29 including the statistical vaccination returns for the year 1928-29 by Dr. Sufi, Assistant Director of Public Health in charge of Vaccination in the Bengal Public Health Department. I have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient servant, CHAS. A. BENTLEY, Director of Public Health, Bengal.
Fourteenth Triennial Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the years 1926-27, 1927-28 and 1928-29. I have the honour to submit the following Report on Vaccination in Bengal for the triennium ended with 1928-29. I was in charge of the Vaccination and Vital Statistics Bureau throughout the triennium. 2. Strength of Staff.6 rate of success in primary cases in which results were known declined from 94.1 per cent. to 92.9 per cent., that of revaccinations rose from 53.3 per cent. to 56.5 per cent. 79.7 persons per mille of population were successfully vacci- nated against 62.2 in the previous year. Again, while there was a decrease of 18,745 in the number of children under one year successfully vaccinated, an excess of 30,621 was noticed in the case of children of one year and under six years of age. The recess vaccination fell by 22,601, but while the number of primary operations decreased by 40,429, there was an increase of 17,828 in the number of revaccinations. 4. Vaccination in Rural Areas.7 Both the primary and revaccinations decreased in Birbhum, Midnapur and Pabna. In the Asansol Mining Settle- ment, Bankura and Hooghly while the primary vaccinations increased, there was a reduction in the number of revacci- nations. The reverse was the case in 24- Parganas, Murshidabad, Jessore, Raj- shahi and Jalpaiguri. The remaining 17 districts showed an increase both in primary and revaccinations. In Burd- wan, the Asansol Mining Settlement, Birbhum, Bankura, Hooghly, Howrah, 24-Parganas, Nadia, Dinajpur, Rang- pur, Pabna, Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Bakarganj and Chittagong the line of least resistance was followed with the result that primary vaccina- tions exceeded revaccinations, even though the smallpox epidemic in at least six of these districts was more prevalent in 1928-29 than what it had been in the previous year. It is unfortunate that in these districts the importance of revacci- nation as an essential factor in con- trolling smallpox epidemics was over- looked by the local sanitary authorities, but I trust that this laxity will not be repeated in future. (d) The increase in the number of vaccinations wherever it has occurred, has been due to the presence of smallpox in an epidemic form, which is the only stimulus for the people to get themselves vaccinated. The decrease has been ascribed by the District Health Officers to various causes, chiefly the compara- tive freedom of the district from small- pox during season time, the presence of malaria affecting both the vaccinators and the persons to be vaccinated, the paucity in the number of vaccinators employed, the insufficient supervision exercised by the Sanitary Officers due to their being very busy with anti-cholera work, and to a certain extent by the obstruction caused by anti-vaccination- ists, quacks and conscientious and religious objectors. More attention is said to have been paid to mass revacci- nation to suppress local smallpox epi- demics and hence no time was left to vaccinators to carry on their normal work on primary vaccination in many districts. 5.

But some sort of temporary emergency legis- lation to enforce revaccination and to amend the prosecution laws under the current Vaccination Act, seems to me to be a sine qua non of success, without which the revaccination of adults and primary vaccination of infants even within the prescribed limit of age during the course of the pandemic will be next to impossible. Happily, the question of satisfactory supervision, as necessary as the performance of vaccination itself, has been solved by the appointment of Sanitary Inspectors to every thana under the rural organisation scheme, which ispractically complete. The Government supervision is still a weak point, since with only two Inspectors of Vaccination at my disposal, it is absurd to think of the Public Health Department to keep a strict watch over every loophole through which the pandemic might penetrate the province. It is, therefore, essential that one such supervisor should be appointed to every division as has been suggested by me off and on in these reports. M. E.
